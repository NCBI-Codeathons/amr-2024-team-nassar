Consequently, searching for novel strategies to control microbial pathogenicity is necessary. With the aid of auto-inducers (AIs), quorum sensing (QS) regulates bacterial virulence factors through cell-to-cell signaling networks. AIs are small signaling molecules produced during the stationary phase. When bacterial cultures reach a certain level of growth, these molecules regulate the expression of the bound genes by acting as mirrors that reflect the inoculum density.Gram-positive bacteria use the peptide derivatives of these signaling molecules, whereas Gram-negative bacteria use the fatty acid derivatives, and the majority of bacteria can use both types to modulate the expression of the target gene. Numerous natural and synthetic QS inhibitors (QSIs) have been developed to reduce microbial pathogenesis. Applications of QSI are vital to human health, as well as fisheries and aquaculture, agriculture, and water treatment. Video Abstract.",

Genome mining has allowed for more targeted excavation of biosynthetic potential from natural sources that was previously overlooked. Researchers use bioinformatic algorithms to rapidly identify and predict antimicrobial candidates by studying the genome before even entering the lab.

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Current recommendations for physical exercise include information about the frequency, intensity, type, and duration of exercise. However, to date, there are no recommendations on what time of day one should exercise. The aim was to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis to investigate if the time of day of exercise training in intervention studies influences the degree of improvements in physical performance or health-related outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>The databases EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscus were searched from inception to January 2023. Eligibility criteria were that the studies conducted structured endurance and/or strength training with a minimum of two exercise sessions per week for at least 2Â weeks and compared exercise training between at least two different times of the day using a randomized crossover or parallel group design.<h4>Results</h4>From 14,125 screened articles, 26 articles were included in the systematic review of which seven were also included in the meta-analyses. Both the qualitative synthesis and the quantitative synthesis (i.e., meta-analysis) provide little evidence for or against the hypothesis that training at a specific time of day leads to more improvements in performance-related or health-related outcomes compared to other times. There was some evidence that there is a benefit when training and testing occur at the same time of day, mainly for performance-related outcomes. Overall, the risk of bias in most studies was high.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The current state of research provides evidence neither for nor against a specific time of the day being more beneficial, but provides evidence for larger effects when there is congruency between training and testing times. This review provides recommendations to improve the design and execution of future studies on this topic.<h4>Registration</h4>PROSPERO (CRD42021246468).",

In this study, infant gut microbiota was exposed to a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate (amoxicillin/clavulanate) in an <i>in vitro</i> colon model (TIM-2) with fecal-derived microbiota from 1-month-old (1-M; a mixed-taxa community type) as well as 3-month-old (3-M; <i>Bifidobacterium</i> dominated community type) breastfed infants. We investigated the effect of two common infant prebiotics, 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) or galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), on the resilience of infant gut microbiota to amoxicillin/clavulanate-induced changes in microbiota composition and activity. Amoxicillin/clavulanate treatment decreased alpha diversity and induced a temporary shift of microbiota to a community dominated by enterobacteria. Moreover, antibiotic treatment increased succinate and lactate in both 1- and 3-M colon models, while decreasing the production of short-chain (SCFA) and branched-chain fatty acids (BFCA). The prebiotic effect on the microbiota recovery depended on the fermenting capacity of antibiotic-exposed microbiota. In the 1-M colon model, the supplementation of 2'-FL supported the recovery of microbiota and restored the production of propionate and butyrate. In the 3-M colon model, GOS supplementation supported the recovery of microbiota and increased the production of acetate and butyrate.",

It has antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-psoriasis, and antitumor activities. Therefore, its overproduction in addition to gene expression analysis was our main target. Through this study, we isolated a novel potent mycophenolic acid (MPA) producer strain of the genus Penicillium from the refrigerated Mozzarella cheese and it was identified with the molecular marker ITS and benA genes as P. arizonenseHEWt1. Three MPA overproducer mutants were isolated by exposing the wild type to different doses of gamma-rays, and the fermentation conditions for the highest production of MPA were optimized. The results indicated that MPA amounts produced by the mutants MT1, MT2, and MT3 were increased by 2.1, 1.7, and 1.6-fold, respectively, compared with the wild-type. The growth of both mutant and wild-type strains on PD broth, adjusted to pH 6 and incubated at 25Â Â°C for 15 d, were the best conditions for maximum production of MPA. In a silico study, five orthologs genes of MPA biosynthesizing gene clusters in P. brevicompactum were predicted from the genome of P. arizonense. Sequencing and bioinformatic analyses proved the presence of five putative genes namely mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH in the P. arizonense HEWt1 genome. Gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR indicated an increase in the transcription value of all annotated genes in the three mutants over the wild type. A highly significant increase in the gene expression of mpaC, mpaF, and mpaH was observed in P. arizonense-MT1 compared with wild-type. These results confirmed the positive correlation of these genes in MPA biosynthesis and are the first report regarding the production of MPA by P. arizonense.Kew word.Mycophenolic acid, Penicillium arizonense, mutagenesis, gene expression.",

The echinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces lasalocidi includes a gene encoding the self-resistance protein Ecm16.

The structure of Ecm16 closely resembles that of UvrA, the DNA damage sensor component of the prokaryotic nucleotide excision repair system, but Ecm16 lacks the UvrB-binding domain and its associated zinc-binding module found in UvrA. Mutagenesis study revealed that the insertion domain of Ecm16 is required for DNA binding. Furthermore, the specific amino acid sequence of the insertion domain allows Ecm16 to distinguish echinomycin-bound DNA from normal DNA and link substrate binding to ATP hydrolysis activity. Expression of ecm16 in the heterologous host Brevibacillus choshinensis conferred resistance against echinomycin and other quinomycin antibiotics, including thiocoraline, quinaldopeptin, and sandramycin.

Detected viral families include the plant viral family Potyviridae as well as the tailed bacteriophages of class Caudoviricetes that are mainly associated with bacterial genera <i>Pseudomonas, Streptomyces</i> and <i>Mycobacterium</i>. Viral CAZymes in this soil mainly belong to glycoside hydrolase (GH) families GH43 and GH23. Some of these CAZymes participate in a KEGG pathway with actions included debranching and degradation of hemicellulose. Other actions include biosynthesizing biopolymer of the bacterial cell wall and the layered cell wall structure of peptidoglycan. Other CAZymes promote plant physiological activities such as cell-cell recognition, embryogenesis and programmed cell death (PCD). Enzymes of other pathways help reduce the level of soil H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and participate in the biosynthesis of glycine, malate, isoprenoids, as well as isoprene that protects plant from heat stress. Other enzymes act in promoting both the permeability of bacterial peroxisome membrane and carbon fixation in plants. Some enzymes participate in a balanced supply of dNTPs, successful DNA replication and mismatch repair during bacterial cell division. They also catalyze the release of signal peptides from bacterial membrane prolipoproteins. Phages with the most highly abundant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) transduce species of bacterial genera <i>Pseudomonas, Streptomyces</i>, and <i>Mycobacterium</i>. Abundant mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in the rhizosphere include \"antibiotic efflux pump\" for ARGs <i>soxR, OleC</i>, and <i>MuxB</i>, \"antibiotic target alteration\" for <i>parY mutant</i>, and \"antibiotic inactivation\" for <i>arr-1</i>.<h4>Discussion</h4>These ARGs can act synergistically to inhibit several antibiotics including tetracycline, penam, cephalosporin, rifamycins, aminocoumarin, and oleandomycin.

In return, efflux pumps (EP) form part of the resistance mechanism employed by bacteria to permit their survival in this hostile chemical environment. In this work we study the effect of combinations of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) and plant-derived phytochemicals on bacterial activity using <i>Pectobacteriun brasiliense</i> 1692 (Pb1692) as a model system.<h4>Methods</h4>We measured the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two phytochemicals, phloretin (Pht) and naringenin (Nar), and of one common antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cip), either alone or in combinations with two known inhibitors of the AcrB EP of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, a close homolog of the AcrAB-TolC EP of Pb1692. In addition, we also measured the expression of genes encoding for the EP, under similar conditions.<h4>Results</h4>Using the FICI equation, we observed synergism between the EPIs and the phytochemicals, but not between the EPIs and the antibiotic, suggesting that EP inhibition potentiated the antimicrobial activity of the plant derived compounds, but not of Cip. Docking simulations were successfully used to rationalize these experimental results.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our findings suggest that AcrAB-TolC plays an important role in survival and fitness of Pb1692 in the plant environment and that its inhibition is a viable strategy for controlling bacterial pathogenicity.",

Meanwhile, natural microbial products are acknowledged to play an important role in modern agriculture as they comprehend a safer alternative to synthetic pesticides. Bacterial strains from underexplored environments are a promising source of bioactive metabolites.<h4>Methods</h4>We applied the OSMAC (One Strain, Many Compounds) cultivation approach, in vitro bioassays, and metabolo-genomics analyses to investigate the biochemical potential of <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. So3.2b, a strain isolated from Antarctica. Crude extracts from OSMAC were analyzed through HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS, molecular networking, and annotation. The antifungal potential of the extracts was confirmed against <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> strains. Moreover, the whole-genome sequence was studied for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) identification and phylogenetic comparison.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>Molecular networking revealed that metabolite synthesis has growth media specificity, and it was reflected in bioassays results against R. solani. Bananamides, rhamnolipids, and butenolides-like molecules were annotated from the metabolome, and chemical novelty was also suggested by several unidentified compounds. Additionally, genome mining confirmed a wide variety of BGCs present in this strain, with low to no similarity with known molecules. An NRPS-encoding BGC was identified as responsible for producing the banamides-like molecules, while phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship with other rhizosphere bacteria. Therefore, by combining -omics approaches and <i>in vitro</i> bioassays, our study demonstrates that <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp.

        "pmc_abstract": "Genome mining using standard bioinformatics tools has allowed for the uncovering of hidden biosynthesis gene clusters for specialized metabolites in <i>Streptomyces</i> genomes. In this work, we have used an alternative approach consisting in seeking \"<i>Streptomyces</i> Antibiotic Regulatory Proteins\" (SARP) encoding genes and analyzing their surrounding DNA region to unearth cryptic gene clusters that cannot be identified using standard bioinformatics tools. This strategy has allowed the unveiling of the new <i>ahb</i> cluster in <i>Streptomyces argillaceus</i>, which had not been retrieved before using antiSMASH. The <i>ahb</i> cluster is highly preserved in other <i>Streptomyces</i> strains, which suggests a role for their encoding compounds in specific environmental conditions. By combining overexpression of three regulatory genes and generation of different mutants, we were able to activate the <i>ahb</i> cluster, and to identify and chemically characterize the encoded compounds that we have named ahbamycins (AHBs). These constitute a new family of metabolites derived from 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoate (3,4-AHBA) known for having antibiotic and antitumor activity. Additionally, by overexpressing three genes of the cluster (<i>ahbH</i>, <i>ahbI,</i> and <i>ahbL2</i>) for the synthesis and activation of 3,4-AHBA, a new hybrid compound, AHB18, was identified which had been produced from a metabolic crosstalk between the AHB and the argimycin P pathways. The identification of this new BGC opens the possibility to generate new compounds by combinatorial biosynthesis.",

Here, we report a noncanonical FAD-dependent enzyme Orf1 that adds a glycine-derived N-formimidoyl group to glycinothricin to form the antibiotic BD-12. X-ray crystallography was used to investigate this complex enzymatic process, which showed Orf1 has two substrate-binding sites that sit 13.5âÃ apart unlike canonical FAD-dependent oxidoreductases. One site could accommodate glycine and the other glycinothricin or glycylthricin. Moreover, an intermediate-enzyme adduct with a NOS-covalent linkage was observed in the later site, where it acts as a two-scissile-bond linkage facilitating nucleophilic addition and cofactor-free decarboxylation. The chain length of nucleophilic acceptors vies with bond cleavage sites at either N-O or O-S accounting for N-formimidoylation or N-iminoacetylation.

Recent developments in understanding the complex biosynthesis of nisin have shed light on the cellular location of the modification and transport machinery and the co-ordinated series of spatio-temporal events required to produce active nisin and provide resistance and immunity. The continued unearthing of new natural variants from within human and animal gastrointestinal tracts has sparked interest in the potential application of nisin to influence the microbiome, given the growing recognition of the role the gastrointestinal microbiota plays in health and disease. Moreover, interdisciplinary approaches have taken advantage of biotechnological advancements to bioengineer nisin to produce novel variants and expand nisin functionality for applications in the biomedical field.

The diversity of chromosomally-encoded ARE-ABCFs is far from being fully experimentally explored. Here we characterise phylogenetically diverse genome-encoded ABCFs from Actinomycetia (Ard1 from Streptomyces capreolus, producer of the nucleoside antibiotic A201A), Bacilli (VmlR2 from soil bacterium Neobacillus vireti) and Clostridia (CplR from Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium sporogenes and Clostridioides difficile). We demonstrate that Ard1 is a narrow spectrum ARE-ABCF that specifically mediates self-resistance against nucleoside antibiotics. The single-particle cryo-EM structure of a VmlR2-ribosome complex allows us to rationalise the resistance spectrum of this ARE-ABCF that is equipped with an unusually long antibiotic resistance determinant (ARD) subdomain. We show that CplR contributes to intrinsic pleuromutilin, lincosamide and streptogramin A resistance in Clostridioides, and demonstrate that C. difficile CplR (CDIF630_02847) synergises with the transposon-encoded 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase Erm to grant high levels of antibiotic resistance to the C. difficile 630 clinical isolate.

In bacteria, the importance of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in gene expression has been less investigated than in eukaryotic systems. Through dot-blot analysis employing m5C antibodies against chromosomal DNA, we have previously demonstrated that m5C influences the differentiation of Streptomyces coelicolor A(3)2 M145 in solid sporulating and liquid non-sporulating complex media. Here, we mapped the methylated cytosines of the M145 strain growing in the defined Maltose Glutamate (MG) liquid medium. Sequencing of the M145 genome after bisulfite treatment (BS-sequencing) evidenced 3360 methylated cytosines and the two methylation motifs, GGCmCGG and GCCmCG, in the upstream regions of 321 genes. Besides, the role of cytosine methylation was investigated using the hypo-methylating agent 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) in S. coelicolor cultures, demonstrating that m5C affects both growth and antibiotic biosynthesis. Finally, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis of genes containing the methylation motifs in the upstream regions showed that 5-aza-dC treatment influenced their transcriptional levels and those of the regulatory genes for two antibiotics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the cytosine methylome of S. coelicolor M145, supporting the crucial role ascribed to cytosine methylation in controlling bacterial gene expression.",

Currently, the mechanism and significance of mediating the interaction between different cell types during the division of labor, remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism and ecological function of a policing system for optimizing the division of labor in <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> SQR9. During biofilm formation, cells differentiated into the extracellular matrix (ECM)-producers and cheater-like nonproducers. ECM-producers were also active in the biosynthesis of genomic island-governed toxic bacillunoic acids (BAs) and self-resistance; while the nonproducers were sensitive to this antibiotic and could be partially eliminated. Spo0A was identified to be the co-regulator for triggering both ECM production and BAs synthesis/immunity. Besides its well-known regulation of ECM secretion, Spo0A activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to produce malonyl-CoA, which is essential for BAs biosynthesis, thereby stimulating BAs production and self-immunity. Finally, the policing system not only excluded ECM-nonproducing cheater-like individuals but also improved the production of other public goods such as protease and siderophore, consequently, enhancing the population stability and ecological fitness under stress conditions and in the rhizosphere.

K1 and BCPAP, were tested for cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis after treatment with lenvatinib or chloroquine (CQ) or both. The levels of angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) were measured by ELISA. Transwell and wound-healing assays were performed using endothelial HUVECs cells. The dynamics of microvessels were detected by tubular formation assay. Western blotting was used to determine the expression of LC3-I/II and Atg-7 and alterations in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways. <i>In vivo</i> tumor growth assay and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) was also performed. The results showed that lenvatinib inhibited the viability of K1 and BCPAP cells and caused apoptosis. We further showed that lenvatinib also upregulated autophagy levels in thyroid cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways. Co-administration of lenvatinib with CQ resulted in a greater decrease of VEGFA in the tumor supernatant than with either lenvatinib or CQ alone. Autophagy inhibition enhanced the cytotoxicity and anti-angiogenic ability of lenvatinib, which was supported by the HUVECs migration, wound healing, and tube formation assays. Inhibiting autophagy chemically or genetically enhanced lenvatinib's cytotoxic effects and anti-angiogenic efficacy in thyroid cancer cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In conclusion, lenvatinib inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis and autophagy in human PTC cells. Significantly, the combination of lenvatinib and autophagy inhibition may represent a novel and effective treatment option for PTC, which may be able to overcome drug resistance.",

However, few studies are known about the influence of different agricultural fertilization modes on antibiotic resistome in the paddy-upland rotation soils. Therefore, we conducted a field experiment to compare the effect of different fertilization (chemical fertilizer, slow release fertilizer and commercial organic fertilizer replacement at various rates) on soil antibiotic resistome in paddy-upland rotation fields. Results revealed that a total of 100 ARG subtypes and 9 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) occurred in paddy-upland rotation soil, among which MDR-ARGs, MLSB-ARGs and <i>tet</i>-ARGs were the dominant resistance determinants. Long-term agricultural fertilization remarkably facilitated the vertical accumulation of ARGs, in particular that <i>bla</i> <sub>ampC</sub> and <i>tet</i>O in relative abundance showed significant enrichment with increasing depth. It's worth noting that slow release fertilizer significantly increased soil ARGs, when comparable to manure with 20% replacing amount, but chemical fertilizer had only slight impact on soil ARGs. Fertilization modes affected soil microbial communities, mainly concentrated in the surface layer, while the proportion of <i>Proteobacteria</i> with the highest abundance decreased gradually with increasing depth. Furthermore, microbial community and MGEs were further proved to be essential factors in regulating the variability of ARGs of different fertilization modes by structural equation model, and had strong direct influence (<i>Î»</i>â=â0.61, <i>p</i>â<â0.05; <i>Î»</i>â=â0. 55, <i>p</i>â<â0.01).

The mold <i>Penicillium roqueforti</i>, which is well-known for being responsible for the characteristic texture, blue-green spots, and aroma of the so-called blue-veined cheeses (French Bleu, Roquefort, Gorgonzola, Stilton, Cabrales, and ValdeÃ³n, among others), is able to synthesize different secondary metabolites, including andrastins and mycophenolic acid, as well as several mycotoxins, such as Roquefortines C and D, PR-toxin and eremofortins, Isofumigaclavines A and B, festuclavine, and Annullatins D and F. This review provides a detailed description of the biosynthetic gene clusters and pathways of the main secondary metabolites produced by <i>P. roqueforti</i>, as well as an overview of the regulatory mechanisms controlling secondary metabolism in this filamentous fungus.",

The phenomenon of collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug is accompanied by increased sensitivity to another, provides new opportunities to address both these challenges. Here, we present a high-throughput screening platform termed Collateral Sensitivity Profiling (CSP) to map the difference in bioactivity of large chemical libraries across 29 drug-resistant strains of E. coli. CSP screening of 80 commercial antimicrobials demonstrated multiple CS interactions. Further screening of a 6195-member natural product library revealed extensive CS relationships in nature. In particular, we report the isolation of known and new analogues of borrelidin A with potent CS activities against cephalosporin-resistant strains. Co-dosing ceftazidime with borrelidin A slows broader cephalosporin resistance with no recognizable resistance to borrelidin A itself.",

To colonize our bodies, these microbes have evolved strategies to regulate the immune system and maintain intestinal immune homeostasis by secreting chemical mediators. There is much interest in deciphering these chemicals and furthering their development as novel therapeutics. In this work, we present a combined experimental and computational approach to identifying functional immunomodulatory molecules from the gut microbiome. Based on this approach, we report the discovery of lactomodulin, a unique peptide from <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> that exhibits dual anti-inflammatory and antibiotic activities and minimal cytotoxicity in human cell lines. Lactomodulin reduces several secreted proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-8, IL-6, IL-1Î², and TNF-Î±. As an antibiotic, lactomodulin is effective against a range of human pathogens, and is most potent against antibiotic-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> (VRE). The multifunctional activity of lactomodulin affirms that the microbiome encodes evolved functional molecules with promising therapeutic potential.",

De novo structure elucidation uncovered a linear polycyclic structure consisting of an N-terminal phenol group, an oxazole, tandem <i>N</i>-methyl-thiazolidines, and an unusual C-terminal Î³-thiolactone moiety. Except for the unprecedented oxazoline dehydrogenation to form an oxazole, which we show to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme, other tailoring steps were found necessary for efficient downstream processing. The unusual thioesterase (TE) domain is proposed to select homocysteine or methionine for offloading involving an intramolecular Î³-thiolactone formation. Its active site comprises a rare cysteine, which was found essential for product formation by point mutation to alanine or serine, which both abolished its activity. This unusual release mechanism and the resulting rare thiolactone structure can serve as a starting point for detailed biochemical investigations.",

Therefore, mTOR, whose major function is to enhance anabolism and inhibit catabolism, has become a potential target of inhibition for anti-aging therapy. Interestingly, it was found that the downregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway had a lifespan-extending effect resembling calorie restriction. In addition, the mTOR signaling pathway promotes cell proliferation and has been regarded as a potential anti-cancer target. Rapamycin and rapalogs, such as everolimus, have proven to be effective in preventing certain tumor growth. Here, we reviewed the basic knowledge of mTOR signaling, including both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Then, for anti-aging, we cited a lot of evidence to discuss the role of targeting mTOR and its anti-aging mechanism. For cancer therapy, we also discussed the role of mTOR signaling in different types of cancers, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, tumor immunity, etc. In short, we discussed the research progress and both the advantages and disadvantages of targeting mTOR in anti-aging and anti-cancer therapy. Hopefully, this review may promote more ideas to be generated for developing inhibitors of mTOR signaling to fight cancer and extend lifespan.",

The genes involved in SM biosynthesis are usually clustered adjacent to each other into a region known as a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). The recent advent of a diversity of genetic and genomic technologies has facilitated the identification of many cryptic or uncharacterized BGCs and their associated SMs. However, there are still many challenges that hamper the broader exploration of industrially important secondary metabolites. The recent advanced CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized fungal genetic engineering and enabled the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. In this review, we firstly introduce fungal BGCs and their relationships with associated SMs, followed by a brief summary of the conventional strategies for fungal genetic engineering. Next, we introduce a range of state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas-based tools that have been developed and review recent applications of these methods in fungi for research on the biosynthesis of SMs. Finally, the challenges and limitations of these CRISPR/Cas-based systems are discussed and directions for future research are proposed in order to expand their applications and improve efficiency for fungal genetic engineering.",

Neither the body weight, growth rate, feed-conversion ratio, nor organ-weight data differed between the control (C) and treated (T) groups, indicating that the XENOFOOD diet did not result in any detectable adverse effects. We suppose that the parameters indicating a moderate enlargement of bursas of Fabricius (average weight, size, and individual bursa/spleen weight-ratios) in the XENOFOOD-fed group must be an indirect indication that the bursa-controlled humoral immune system neutralized the cytotoxic ingredients of the XENOFOOD in the blood, not allowing to reach their critical cytotoxic concentration in the sensitive tissues.",

The crystal structures of the homologues CgnB and CgnE reveal them to be the founding members of a peptide-binding protein family and allow us to rationalize their distinct functions. We further show that the hydrolase CgnD liberates the crocagin core scaffold, which is subsequently N-methylated by CgnL. These insights allow us to propose a biosynthetic scheme for crocagins. Bioinformatic analyses based on these data led to the discovery of related biosynthetic pathways that may provide access to a structurally diverse family of peptide-derived pyrroloindoline alkaloids.",

Here, we report the 3D chromosome organization and its dynamics of the model strain, <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i>, during the different growth phases. The chromosome undergoes a dramatic global structural change from primary to secondary metabolism, while some biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) form special local structures when highly expressed. Strikingly, transcription levels of endogenous genes are found to be highly correlated to the local chromosomal interaction frequency as defined by the value of the frequently interacting regions (FIREs). Following the criterion, an exogenous single reporter gene and even complex BGC can achieve a higher expression after being integrated into the chosen loci, which may represent a unique strategy to activate or enhance the production of natural products based on the local chromosomal 3D organization.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Phosphonothrixin is an herbicidal phosphonate natural product with an unusual, branched carbon skeleton. Bioinformatic analyses of the <i>ftx</i> gene cluster, which is responsible for synthesis of the compound, suggest that early steps of the biosynthetic pathway, up to production of the intermediate 2,3-dihydroxypropylphosphonic acid (DHPPA) are identical to those of the unrelated phosphonate natural product valinophos. This conclusion was strongly supported by the observation of biosynthetic intermediates from the shared pathway in spent media from two phosphonothrixin producing strains. Biochemical characterization of <i>ftx</i>-encoded proteins confirmed these early steps, as well as subsequent steps involving the oxidation of DHPPA to 3-hydroxy-2-oxopropylphosphonate and its conversion to phosphonothrixin by the combined action of an unusual heterodimeric, thiamine-pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent ketotransferase and a TPP-dependent acetolactate synthase. The frequent observation of <i>ftx</i>-like gene clusters within actinobacteria suggests that production of compounds related to phosphonothrixin is common within these bacteria. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Phosphonic acid natural products, such as phosphonothrixin, have great potential for biomedical and agricultural applications; however, discovery and development of these compounds requires detailed knowledge of the metabolism involved in their biosynthesis. The studies reported here reveal the biochemical pathway phosphonothrixin production, which enhances our ability to design strains that overproduce this potentially useful herbicide. This knowledge also improves our ability to predict the products of related biosynthetic gene clusters and the functions of homologous enzymes.",

The \"Trojan horse\" antibiotic albomycins are unique sideromycins consisting of a ferrichrome-type siderophore conjugated to a peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic. They exhibit potent antibacterial activities against many model bacteria and a number of clinical pathogens. Earlier studies have provided significant insight into the biosynthetic pathway of the peptidyl nucleoside moiety. We herein decipher the biosynthetic pathway of the ferrichrome-type siderophore in Streptomyces sp. ATCC 700974. Our genetic studies suggested that abmA, abmB, and abmQ are involved in the formation of the ferrichrome-type siderophore. Additionally, we performed biochemical studies to demonstrate that a flavin-dependent monooxygenase AbmB and an N-acyltransferase AbmA catalyze sequential modifications of L-ornithine to generate N<sup>5</sup>-acetyl-N<sup>5</sup>-hydroxyornithine. Three molecules of N<sup>5</sup>-acetyl-N<sup>5</sup>-hydroxyornithine are then assembled to generate the tripeptide ferrichrome through the action of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase AbmQ. Of special note, we found out that orf05026 and orf03299, two genes scattered elsewhere in the chromosome of Streptomyces sp. ATCC 700974, have functional redundancy for abmA and abmB, respectively. Interestingly, both orf05026 and orf03299 are situated within gene clusters encoding putative siderophores. In summary, this study provided new insight into the siderophore moiety of albomycin biosynthesis and shed light on the contingency of multiple siderophores in albomycin-producing Streptomyces sp.

        "pmc_abstract": "Lasalocid, a representative polyether ionophore, has been successfully applied in veterinary medicine and animal husbandry and also displays promising potential for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the regulatory system governing lasalocid biosynthesis remains obscure. Here, we identified two conserved (<i>lodR2</i> and <i>lodR3</i>) and one variable (<i>lodR1</i>, found only in <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. strain FXJ1.172) putative regulatory genes through a comparison of the lasalocid biosynthetic gene cluster (<i>lod</i>) from <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. FXJ1.172 with those (<i>las</i> and <i>lsd</i>) from Streptomyces lasalocidi. Gene disruption experiments demonstrated that both <i>lodR1</i> and <i>lodR3</i> positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis in <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. FXJ1.172, while <i>lodR2</i> plays a negative regulatory role. To unravel the regulatory mechanism, transcriptional analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) along with footprinting experiments were performed. The results revealed that LodR1 and LodR2 could bind to the intergenic regions of <i>lodR1</i>-<i>lodAB</i> and <i>lodR2</i>-<i>lodED</i>, respectively, thereby repressing the transcription of the <i>lodAB</i> and <i>lodED</i> operons, respectively. The repression of <i>lodAB</i>-<i>lodC</i> by LodR1 likely boosts lasalocid biosynthesis. Furthermore, LodR2 and LodE constitute a repressor-activator system that senses changes in intracellular lasalocid concentrations and coordinates its biosynthesis. LodR3 could directly activate the transcription of key structural genes. Comparative and parallel functional analyses of the homologous genes in S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180<sup>T</sup> confirmed the conserved roles of <i>lodR2</i>, <i>lodE</i>, and <i>lodR3</i> in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis. Intriguingly, the variable gene locus <i>lodR1</i>-<i>lodC</i> from <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. FXJ1.172 seems functionally conserved when introduced into <i>S. lasalocidi</i> ATCC 31180<sup>T</sup>. Overall, our findings demonstrate that lasalocid biosynthesis is tightly controlled by both conserved and variable regulators, providing valuable guidance for further improving lasalocid production. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Compared to its elaborated biosynthetic pathway, the regulation of lasalocid biosynthesis remains obscure. Here, we characterize the roles of regulatory genes in lasalocid biosynthetic gene clusters of two distinct <i>Streptomyces</i> species and identify a conserved repressor-activator system, LodR2-LodE, which could sense changes in the concentration of lasalocid and coordinate its biosynthesis with self-resistance. Furthermore, in parallel, we verify that the regulatory system identified in a new <i>Streptomyces</i> isolate is valid in the industrial lasalocid producer and thus applicable for the construction of high-yield strains. These findings deepen our understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in the production of polyether ionophores and provide novel clues for the rational design of industrial strains for scaled-up production.",

Its specialized metabolites were profiled using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, followed by antibacterial, anticancer, and toxicity screening. The <i>S. tubbatahanensis</i> DSD3025<sup>T</sup> genome was comprised of 7.76 Mbp with a 72.3% G+C content. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values were 96.5% and 64.1%, respectively, compared with its closest related species, thus delineating the novelty of <i>Streptomyces</i> species. The genome encoded 29 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), including a BGC region containing tryptophan halogenase and its associated flavin reductase, which were not found in its close <i>Streptomyces</i> relatives. The metabolite profiling unfolded six rare halogenated carbazole alkaloids, with chlocarbazomycin A as the major compound. A biosynthetic pathway for chlocarbazomycin A was proposed using genome mining, metabolomics, and bioinformatics platforms. Chlocarbazomycin A produced by <i>S. tubbatahanensis</i> DSD3025<sup>T</sup> has antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA-44 and Streptococcus pyogenes and showed antiproliferative activity against colon (HCT-116) and ovarian (A2780) human cancer cell lines. Chlocarbazomycin A exhibited no toxicity to liver cells but moderate and high toxicity to kidney and cardiac cell lines, respectively. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> <i>Streptomyces tubbatahanensis</i> DSD3025<sup>T</sup> is a novel actinomycete with antibiotic and anticancer activities from Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site in Sulu Sea and considered one of the Philippines' oldest and most-well-protected marine ecosystems. <i>In silico</i> genome mining tools were used to identify putative BGCs that led to the discovery of genes involved in the production of halogenated carbazole alkaloids and new natural products. By integrating bioinformatics-driven genome mining and metabolomics, we unearthed the hidden biosynthetic richness and mined the associated chemical entities from the novel <i>Streptomyces</i> species. The bioprospecting of novel <i>Streptomyces</i> species from marine sediments of underexplored ecological niches serves as an important source of antibiotic and anticancer drug leads with unique chemical scaffolds.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Phazolicin (PHZ) is a peptide antibiotic exhibiting narrow-spectrum activity against rhizobia closely related to its producer, <i>Rhizobium</i> sp. strain Pop5. Here, we show that the frequency of spontaneous PHZ-resistant mutants in Sinorhizobium meliloti is below the detection limit. We find that PHZ can enter S. meliloti cells through two distinct promiscuous peptide transporters, BacA and YejABEF, which belong to the SLiPT (SbmA-like peptide transporter) and ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter families, respectively. The dual-uptake mode explains the lack of observed resistance acquisition because the simultaneous inactivation of both transporters is necessary for resistance to PHZ. Since both BacA and YejABEF are essential for the development of functional symbiosis of S. meliloti with leguminous plants, the unlikely acquisition of PHZ resistance via the inactivation of these transporters is further disfavored. A whole-genome transposon sequencing screen did not reveal additional genes that can provide strong PHZ resistance when inactivated. However, it was found that the capsular polysaccharide KPS, the novel putative envelope polysaccharide PPP (PHZ-protecting polysaccharide), as well as the peptidoglycan layer jointly contribute to the sensitivity of S. meliloti to PHZ, most likely serving as barriers that reduce the amount of PHZ transported inside the cell. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Many bacteria produce antimicrobial peptides to eliminate competitors and create an exclusive niche. These peptides act either by membrane disruption or by inhibiting essential intracellular processes. The Achilles' heel of the latter type of antimicrobials is their dependence on transporters to enter susceptible cells. Transporter inactivation results in resistance. Here, we show that a rhizobial ribosome-targeting peptide, phazolicin (PHZ), uses two different transporters, BacA and YejABEF, to enter the cells of a symbiotic bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti. This dual-entry mode dramatically reduces the probability of the appearance of PHZ-resistant mutants. Since these transporters are also crucial for S. meliloti symbiotic associations with host plants, their inactivation in natural settings is strongly disfavored, making PHZ an attractive lead for the development of biocontrol agents for agriculture.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Streptomyces</i> spp. are well-known producers of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs) that serve as pharmaceutical agents. In addition to their ability to produce SMs, <i>Streptomyces</i> spp. have evolved diverse membrane transport systems to protect cells against antibiotics produced by itself or other microorganisms. We previously screened mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor that show a phenotype of reduced undecylprodigiosin (RED) production in a combined-culture with Tsukamurella pulmonis. Here, we identified a point mutation, which reduced RED production, by performing genome resequencing and genetic complementation. We found that inactivation of the <i>sco1718</i> gene encoding the TetR family transcriptional regulator (TFR) produced a deficient phenotype for several SMs in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). In the genome of S. coelicolor A3(2), two other sets of TFR and two-component ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes (<i>sco4358-4360</i> and <i>sco5384-5382</i>) were found which had similar effects on the phenotype for both secondary metabolism and antibiotic resistance. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR experiments demonstrated that TFRs repressed the expression of each adjacent two-component ABC transporter genes by binding to the operator sequence. Notably, the Î<i>sco1718</i> mutant showed increased resistance to several antibiotics of other actinomycete origin. Our results imply the switching of cell metabolism to direct offense (antibiotic production) or defense (efflux pump activation) using costly and limited quantities of cell energy sources (e.g., ATP) in the soil ecosystem. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The bacterial metabolic potential to synthesize diverse secondary metabolites in the environment has been revealed by recent (meta)genomics of both unculturable and culturable bacteria. These studies imply that bacteria are continuously exposed to harmful chemical compounds in the environment. <i>Streptomyces</i> spp. contain antibiotic efflux pumps and SM biosynthetic gene clusters. However, the mechanism by which soil bacteria, including <i>Streptomyces</i>, survive against toxic compounds in the environment remains unclear. Here, we identified three sets of TFR-ABC transporter genes in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). We found that each TFR controlled the expression of respective ABC transporter, and the expression of all ABC transporters negatively impacted SM production and increased antibiotic resistance. Notably, bioinformatic analysis indicated that these TFR-ABC transporter gene sets are highly conserved and widely distributed in the genome of <i>Streptomyces</i> species, indicating the importance of systematic regulation that directs antibiotic production and xenobiotic excretion.",

        "pmc_abstract": "To adapt and proliferate, bacteria must sense and respond to the ever-changing environment. Transmembrane transcription regulators (TTRs) are a family of one-component transcription regulators that respond to extracellular information and influence gene expression from the cytoplasmic membrane. How TTRs function to modulate expression of their target genes while localized to the cytoplasmic membrane remains poorly understood. In part, this is due to a lack of knowledge regarding the prevalence of TTRs among prokaryotes. Here, we show that TTRs are highly diverse and prevalent throughout bacteria and archaea. Our work demonstrates that TTRs are more common than previously appreciated and are enriched within specific bacterial and archaeal phyla and that many TTRs have unique transmembrane region properties that can facilitate association with detergent-resistant membranes. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> One-component signal transduction systems are the major class of signal transduction systems among bacteria and are commonly cytoplasmic. TTRs are a group of unique one-component signal transduction systems that influence transcription from the cytoplasmic membrane. TTRs have been implicated in a wide array of biological pathways critical for both pathogens and human commensal organisms but were considered to be rare. Here, we demonstrate that TTRs are in fact highly diverse and broadly distributed in bacteria and archaea. Our findings suggest that transcription factors can access the chromosome and influence transcription from the membrane in both archaea and bacteria. This study challenges thus the commonly held notion that signal transduction systems require a cytoplasmic transcription factor and highlights the importance of the cytoplasmic membrane in directly influencing signal transduction.",

To this end, we have investigated the time course of genome-wide transcription in the myxobacterium Sorangium sp. So ce836 in relation to its production of natural compounds. Time-resolved RNA sequencing revealed that core biosynthesis genes from 48 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs; 92% of all BGCs encoded in the genome) were actively transcribed at specific time points in a batch culture. The majority (80%) of polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes displayed distinct peaks of transcription during exponential bacterial growth. Strikingly, these bursts in BGC transcriptional activity were associated with surges in the net production rates of known natural compounds, indicating that their biosynthesis was critically regulated at the transcriptional level. In contrast, BGC read counts from single time points had limited predictive value about biosynthetic activity, since transcription levels varied >100-fold among BGCs with detected natural products. Taken together, our time-course data provide unique insights into the dynamics of natural compound biosynthesis and its regulation in a wild-type myxobacterium, challenging the commonly cited notion of preferential BGC expression under nutrient-limited conditions. The close association observed between BGC transcription and compound production warrants additional efforts to develop genetic engineering tools for boosting compound yields from myxobacterial producer strains.",

Previously, we reported that biosynthetic engineering in a heterologous host generated novel darobactins with enhanced antibacterial activity. Here we utilize an optimized purification method and present cryo-EM structures of the Bam complex with darobactin 9 (D9), which served as a blueprint for the biotechnological generation of twenty new darobactins including halogenated analogs. The newly engineered darobactin 22 binds more tightly to BamA and outperforms the favorable activity profile of D9 against clinically relevant pathogens such as carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii up to 32-fold, without observing toxic effects.",

In this work, a solid co-culture system was furtherly proposed to illustrate the different impacts of endophytic fungi on the biochemical status of grape cells of different varieties. By measuring the metabolic impacts of contact fungal endophytes on grape cells of the varieties 'Rose honey' (RH) and 'Cabernet sauvignon' (CS), we observed that most of the fungal strains used had promoting effects on grape cellular biochemistry parameters. Compared with the control, inoculation with most of the fungal strains increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activities as well as the total flavonoid (TF) and total phenolics (TPh) contents in both types of grape cells. Among the tested strains, RH34, RH49 and MDR36 had relatively stronger biochemical impacts on grape cells. More interestingly, in addition to the varietal specificity, a certain degree of fungal genus specificity was also observed during the metabolic interactions between fungal endophytes and grape cells, as fungal endophytes from the same genus tended to be clustered into the same group based on the affected biochemical traits. This work revealed the differential biochemical status effects of fungal endophytes on different varietal grape cells and raised the possibility of reshaping grape qualities by applying endophytes.",

The three antifungal classes that comprise our present day armamentarium have facilitated efficacious treatment of these fungal infections in past decades, but their potency has steadily declined over the years as resistance to these compounds has accumulated. Importantly, pan-resistant strains of <i>Candida auris</i> have been observed in clinical settings, leaving affected patients with no treatment options and a death sentence. Many compounds in the ongoing antifungal drug discovery pipeline, similar to those within our aforementioned trinity, are predicated on the binding or inhibition of ergosterol. Recurring accounts of resistance to antifungals targeting this pathway suggest optimization of ergosterol-dependent antifungals is likely not the best solution for the long-term. This review aims to present several natural products with novel or underexplored biological targets, as well as similarly underutilized drug discovery strategies to inspire future biological investigations and medicinal chemistry campaigns.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Bacteria protect themselves from the toxicity of antimicrobial metabolites they produce through several strategies. In one resistance mechanism, bacteria assemble a non-toxic precursor on an N-acyl-d-asparagine prodrug motif in the cytoplasm, then export it to the periplasm where a dedicated d-amino peptidase hydrolyzes the prodrug motif. These prodrug-activating peptidases contain an N-terminal periplasmic S12 hydrolase domain and C-terminal transmembrane domains (TMDs) of varying lengths: type I peptidases contain three transmembrane helices, and type II peptidases have an additional C-terminal ABC half-transporter. We review studies which have addressed the role of the TMD in function, the substrate specificity, and the biological assembly of ClbP, the type I peptidase that activates colibactin. We use modeling and sequence analyses to extend those insights to other prodrug-activating peptidases and ClbP-like proteins which are not part of prodrug resistance gene clusters. These ClbP-like proteins may play roles in the biosynthesis or degradation of other natural products, including antibiotics, may adopt different TMD folds, and have different substrate specificity compared to prodrug-activating homologs. Finally, we review the data supporting the long-standing hypothesis that ClbP interacts with transporters in the cell and that this association is important for the export of other natural products. Future investigations of this hypothesis as well as of the structure and function of type II peptidases will provide a complete account of the role of prodrug-activating peptidases in the activation and secretion of bacterial toxins.",

Furthermore, based on the crystal structure of SacH-NADPH-SAC-A ternary complexes and mutagenesis, we proposed a catalytic mechanism that is distinct from the previously characterized short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases-mediated inactivation of hemiaminal pharmacophore.

Over the last years, combinations of genome mining, reverse genetics, metabolomics, biochemistry, and structural biology deciphered principles of ETP production.

Here, we present a metagenomic analysis of 12 soil samples from Russian Arctic and subarctic pristine areas: Chukotka, Yakutia and Kamchatka, including nine permafrost samples collected at various depths. These large datasets (9.2 Ã 10<sup>11</sup> total bp) were assembled (525â313 contigs >Â 5 kb), theirÂ encoded protein contents predicted, and then used to perform taxonomical assignments of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, as well as DNA viruses. The various samples exhibited variable DNA contents and highly diverse taxonomic profiles showing no obvious relationship with their locations, depths or deposit ages. Bacteria represented the largely dominant DNA fraction (95%) in all samples, followed by archaea (3.2%), surprisingly little eukaryotes (0.5%), and viruses (0.4%). Although no common taxonomic pattern was identified, the samples shared unexpected high frequencies of Î²-lactamase genes, almost 0.9 copy/bacterial genome. In addition to known environmental threats, the particularly intense warming of the Arctic might thus enhance the spread of bacterial antibiotic resistances, today's major challenge in public health. Î²-Lactamases were also observed at high frequency in other types of soils, suggesting their general role in the regulation of bacterial populations.",

Acarbose is an inhibitor of both human and bacterial Î±-glucosidases<sup>3</sup>, limiting the ability of theÂ target organism to metabolize complex carbohydrates. Using biochemical assays, X-ray crystallography and metagenomic analyses, we show that microbiome-derived acarbose kinases are specific for acarbose, provide their harbouring organism with a protective advantage against the activity of acarbose, and are widespread in the microbiomes of western and non-western human populations. These results provide an example of widespread microbiome resistance to a non-antibiotic drug, and suggest that acarbose resistance has disseminated in the human microbiome as a defensive strategy against a potential endogenous producer of a closely related molecule.",

Salvia miltiorrhiza can transmit the signal of resistance to root rot through the jasmonic acid pathway; When plants suffer from disease stress, the content of JA increases significantly, and the increase of JA content will inhibit the content of SA in plants; The gene expression of PR-10 gene in the roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza with arbuscular mycorrhizal network infected by pathogenic fungi was 17.56 times higher than that inoculated only with pathogenic fungi; Changes in hormone content will also cause changes in the expression of related defense genes, such as SnRK2 is inhibited by ABA in the signal transduction pathway, while JA and ABA show antagonistic changes after inoculation of pathogenic fungi in Salvia miltiorrhiza, so JA may positively regulate the expression of SnRK2 gene. Plants can transmit signals through AM hyphal network after being stressed by the pathogen Fusarium solani. In the arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal network, JA has important significance for the signal transmission of resistance to root rot and disease resistance of Salvia miltiorrhiza, which can make Salvia miltiorrhiza ready for stress resistance and improve the stress resistance of Salvia miltiorrhiza. This experiment is of great significance to further analyze the signal transmission mechanism of the arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal network.",

In this study, Enteromorpha prolifera powder is considered a promising biomass resource for the production of commercial chemical products production. Ilamycins, novel cyclic heptapeptides with significant anti-TB activities, are isolated from Streptomyces atratus SCSIO ZH16, a deep-sea-derived strain. Using EP powder as a nitrogen source, the production of ilamycins reached 709.97Â mg/L through optimization of the nitrogen source using the engineered strain S. atratus SCSIO ZH16 ÎR. After mutant strain constructions and tests, strain S. atratus SCSIO ZH16 ÎR::bldD EP powder achieved a higher production titer of ilamycins. Furthermore, the production titer of ilamycins and ilamycin E reached 1561.77Â mg/L and 745.44Â mg/L, respectively, in a 5Â L bioreactor.

In this study, we analyzed in vitro the interaction of human primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto N40 in presence or absence of bacterial commensal supernatants. We aimed to highlight the role of resident skin cells and skin microbiome on the inflammation induced by B. burgdorferi s.s.. The secretomes of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium striatum and Cutibacterium acnes showed an overall increase in the expression of IL-8, CXCL1, MCP-1 and SOD-2 by fibroblasts, and of IL-8, CXCL1, MCP-1 and hBD-2 in the undifferentiated keratinocytes. Commensal bacteria showed a repressive effect on the expression of IL-8, CXCL1 and MCP-1 by differentiated keratinocytes. Besides the inflammatory effect observed in the presence of Borrelia on all cell types, the cutaneous microbiome appears to promote a rapid innate response of resident skin cells during the onset of Borrelia infection.",

Although the fungal non-ribosomal peptide gliotoxin (GT) is known to exhibit antibacterial activity, the mechanism(s) of action are unknown, although reduced gliotoxin (dithiol gliotoxin; DTG) is a zinc chelator. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that GT synergises with vancomycin to inhibit growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Here we demonstrate, without precedent, that GT-mediated growth inhibition of both Gram positive and negative bacterial species is reversed by Zn<sup>2+</sup> or Cu<sup>2+</sup> addition. Both GT, and the known zinc chelator TPEN, mediate growth inhibition of Enterococcus faecalis which is reversed by zinc addition. Moreover, zinc also reverses the synergistic growth inhibition of E. faecalis observed in the presence of both GT and vancomycin (4Â Âµg/ml). As well as zinc chelation, DTG also appears to chelate Cu<sup>2+</sup>, but not Mn<sup>2+</sup> using a 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol assay system and Zn<sup>2+</sup> as a positive control. DTG also specifically reacts in Fe<sup>3+</sup>-containing Siderotecâ¢ assays, most likely by Fe<sup>3+</sup> chelation from test reagents. GSH or DTT show no activity in these assays. Confirmatory high resolution mass spectrometry, in negative ion mode, confirmed, for the first time, the presence of both Cu[DTG] and Fe[DTG]<sub>2</sub> chelates. Label free quantitative proteomic analysis further revealed major intracellular proteomic remodelling within E. faecalis in response to GT exposure for 30-180Â min. Globally, 4.2-7.2% of detectable proteins exhibited evidence of either unique presence/increased abundance or unique absence/decreased abundance (nâ=â994-1160 total proteins detected), which is the first demonstration that GT affects the bacterial proteome in general, and E. faecalis, specifically. Unique detection of components of the AdcABC and AdcA-II zinc uptake systems was observed, along with apparent ribosomal reprofiling to zinc-free paralogs in the presence of GT. Overall, we hypothesise that GT-mediated bacterial growth inhibition appears to involve intracellular zinc depletion or reduced bioavailability, and based on in vitro chelate formation, may also involve dysregulation of Cu<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Anti-microbial peptides provide a powerful toolkit for combating multidrug resistance. Combating eukaryotic pathogens is complicated because the intracellular drug targets in the eukaryotic pathogen are frequently homologs of cellular structures of vital importance in the host organism. The entomopathogenic bacteria (EPB), symbionts of entomopathogenic-nematode species, release a series of non-ribosomal templated anti-microbial peptides. Some may be potential drug candidates. The ability of an entomopathogenic-nematode/entomopathogenic bacterium symbiotic complex to survive in a given polyxenic milieu is a coevolutionary product. This explains that those gene complexes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of different non-ribosomal templated anti-microbial protective peptides (including those that are potently capable of inactivating the protist mammalian pathogen <i>Leishmania donovanii</i> and the gallinaceous bird pathogen <i>Histomonas meleagridis</i>) are co-regulated. Our approach is based on comparative anti-microbial bioassays of the culture media of the wild-type and regulatory mutant strains. We concluded that <i>Xenorhabdus budapestensis</i> and <i>X. szentirmaii</i> are excellent sources of non-ribosomal templated anti-microbial peptides that are efficient antagonists of the mentioned pathogens. Data on selective cytotoxicity of different cell-free culture media encourage us to forecast that the recently discovered \"easy-PACId\" research strategy is suitable for constructing entomopathogenic-bacterium (EPB) strains producing and releasing single, harmless, non-ribosomal templated anti-microbial peptides with considerable drug, (probiotic)-candidate potential.",

Our study provides key insights on camptothecin biosynthesis in this recently discovered endophyte. The whole genome sequence of A. burnsii NCIM 1409 was assembled and screened for biosynthetic gene clusters. Comparative studies with related fungi supported the identification of candidate genes involved in camptothecin synthesis and also helped to understand some aspects of the endophyte's defense against the toxic effects of camptothecin.

        "pmc_abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global problem and threat to humanity. The search for new antibiotics is directed towards targeting of novel microbial systems and enzymes, as well as augmenting the activity of pre-existing antimicrobials. Sulphur-containing metabolites (e.g., auranofin and bacterial dithiolopyrrolones [e.g., holomycin]) and Zn2+-chelating ionophores (PBT2) have emerged as important antimicrobial classes. The sulphur-containing, non-ribosomal peptide gliotoxin, biosynthesised by Aspergillus fumigatus and other fungi exhibits potent antimicrobial activity, especially in the dithiol form (dithiol gliotoxin; DTG). Specifically, it has been revealed that deletion of the enzymes gliotoxin oxidoreductase GliT, bis-thiomethyltransferase GtmA or the transporter GliA dramatically sensitise A. fumigatus to gliotoxin presence. Indeed, the double deletion strain A. fumigatus ÎgliTÎgtmA is especially sensitive to gliotoxin-mediated growth inhibition, which can be reversed by Zn2+ presence. Moreover, DTG is a Zn2+ chelator which can eject zinc from enzymes and inhibit activity. Although multiple studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial effect of gliotoxin, no mechanistic details are available. Interestingly, reduced holomycin can inhibit metallo-Î²-lactamases. Since holomycin and gliotoxin can chelate Zn2+, resulting in metalloenzyme inhibition, we propose that this metal-chelating characteristic of these metabolites requires immediate investigation to identify new antibacterial drug targets or to augment the activity of existing antimicrobials. Given that (i) gliotoxin has been shown in vitro to significantly enhance vancomycin activity against Staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) that it has been independently proposed as an ideal probe to dissect the central 'Integrator' role of Zn2+ in bacteria - we contend such studies are immediately undertaken to help address AMR.",

Highly abundant genes were shown to mainly exist in members of the genera <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Streptomyces</i>, <i>Mycobacterium</i> and <i>Rhodococcus</i>. Enriched CAZymes belong to glycoside hydrolase families GH4, GH6, GH12, GH15 and GH43 and mainly function in D-glucose biosynthesis via 10 biochemical passages.

Agriculture relies heavily on chemical pesticides to control disease, but due to safety concerns multiple agents have been withdrawn. <i>Burkholderia</i> were successfully used as commercial biopesticides because of their fungicidal activity and plant protective traits. However, their potential for opportunistic pathogenicity led to a moratorium on their registration as biopesticides. Subsequently, <i>Burkholderia</i> were shown to produce multiple specialised metabolites including potent antimicrobial polyynes. Cepacin A, a polyyne produced by <i>Burkholderia ambifaria</i> biopesticide strains was shown to be an important metabolite for the protection of germinating peas against <i>Globisporangium ultimum</i> (formerly <i>Pythium</i>) damping-off disease. Recently, there has been an expansion in bacterial polyyne discovery, with the metabolites and their biosynthetic gene pathways found in several bacterial genera including <i>Burkholderia</i>, <i>Collimonas</i>, <i>Trinickia</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas</i>. To define the efficacy of these bacterial polyyne producers as biopesticidal agents, we systematically evaluated metabolite production, <i>in vitro</i> microbial antagonism, and <i>G. ultimum</i> biocontrol across a panel of 30 strains representing four bacterial genera. <i>In vitro</i> polyyne production and antimicrobial activity was demonstrated for most strains, but only <i>Burkholderia</i> polyyne producers were protective within the <i>in vivo G. ultimum</i> damping-off pea protection model. <i>B. ambifaria</i> was the most effective cepacin-expressing biopesticide, and despite their known potential for plant pathogenicity <i>Burkholderia gladioli</i> and <i>Burkholderia plantarii</i> were uniquely shown to be protective as caryoynencin-producing biopesticides. In summary, <i>Burkholderia</i> are effective biopesticides due to their suite of antimicrobials, but the ability to deploy polyyne metabolites, caryoynencin and cepacin, is strain and species dependent.

In the present study, we have found that the fermented extract of stevia (<i>Stevia rebaudiana</i>) leaves with plant-derived lactic acid bacteria (LABs), <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> LY45, improves the trimethylamine (TMA) productivity of cecal content, which can be used as an indicator of dysbiosis. The following animal experiment also shows that the LY45-fermented stevia extract represses the typical increase in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, which decreased from 1106 to 210 IU/L (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and from 591 to 100 IU/L (<i>p</i> < 0.05), respectively, together with the simultaneously latent TMA productivity (from 1356 to 745 Î¼M, <i>p</i> < 0.05) of cecal content in the ethanol-fed mice. The microbiota analyses have shown that the observed increased alterations in pro-inflammatory genera putative <i>SMB53</i> (family Clostridiaceae) and <i>Dorea</i> are restored by the fermented stevia extract. Our result indicates that the preliminary bioconversion of herbal medicinal precursors by fermentation with safe microorganisms like LABs is expected to be a hopeful method of producing specific metabolites that may contribute to the reconstruction of gut microbiota.",

Thus, there is an ever-increasing demand for discovery of novel effective antibiotics with new modes of function against resistant pathogens. Endophytic actinobacteria (EA) have currently been considered as one of the most prospective group of microorganisms for discovery of therapeutic agents. This study aimed to isolate EA from Thymes kotschyanus, Allium hooshidaryae, and Cerasus microcarpa plants and to evaluate their antibacterial properties. The healthy samples were collected, dissected and surface-sterilized before cultured on four different selection media at 28Â Â°C. Nine EA were isolated and identified based on morphological and molecular properties, and scanning electron micrograph analyses. Based on phylogenetic analysis, they were taxonomically grouped into four families Streptomycetaceae, Nocardiaceae, Micromonosporaceae, and Pseudonocardiaceae. Their branched aerial mycelia produced chains of cylindrical or cube or oval shaped spores with smooth or rough surfaces. Four strains; IKBG03, IKBG05, IKBG13, and IKBG17 had less than 98.65% sequence similarity to their closely related strains, which constitute them as novel species/strains. Besides, three strains; IKBG05, IKBG13, and IKBG18 were reported as endophytes for the first time. Preliminary antibacterial activity conducted on the all isolates revealed potent antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All isolates strongly inhibited the growth of at least one of the tested pathogens. Our results reveals that the test plants are novel sources for isolating a diverse group of rare and common actinobacteria that could produce a wide range of novel biologically active natural products with antibacterial activity which have a great potential in pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications.",

Identifying resistance genes from biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) helps us understand the self-defense mechanism and predict the biological activity of natural products synthesized by microorganisms. However, a comprehensive database of resistance genes is still lacking, which hinders natural product annotation studies in large-scale genome mining. In this study, we compiled a resistance gene database (RGDB) by scanning the four available databases: CARD, MIBiG, NCBIAMR, and UniProt. Every resistance gene in the database was annotated with resistance mechanisms and possibly involved chemical compounds, using manual annotation and transformation from the resource databases. The RGDB was applied to analyze resistance genes in 7432 BGCs in 1390 genomes from a marine microbiome project. Our calculation showed that the RGDB successfully identified resistance genes for more than half of the BGCs, suggesting that the database helps prioritize BGCs that produce biologically active natural products.",

Neogastropods, a group of marine predators representing almost 22% of the known gastropod diversity, evolved a wide range of feeding strategies, including the production of toxins to subdue their preys. However, whether the diversity of these compounds is at the origin of the hyperdiversification of the group and how genome evolution may correlate with both the compounds and species diversities remain understudied. Among the available gastropods genomes, only eight, with uneven quality assemblies, belong to neogastropods. Here, we generated chromosome-level assemblies of two species belonging to the Tonnoidea and Muricoidea superfamilies (Monoplex corrugatus and Stramonita haemastoma). The two obtained high-quality genomes had 3 and 2.2âGb, respectively, and 92-89% of the total assembly conformed 35 pseudochromosomes in each species. Through the analysis of syntenic blocks, Hox gene cluster duplication, and synonymous substitutions distribution pattern, we inferred the occurrence of a whole genome duplication event in both genomes. As these species are known to release venom, toxins were annotated in both genomes, but few of them were found in homologous chromosomes. A comparison of the expression of ohnolog genes (using transcriptomes from osphradium and salivary glands in S. haemastoma), where both copies were differentially expressed, showed that most of them had similar expression profiles. The high quality of these genomes makes them valuable reference in their respective taxa, facilitating the identification of genome-level processes at the origin of their evolutionary success.",

The agar disc diffusion method and Î±-amylase inhibition assay were used to examine the antibacterial and anti-diabetic potential of the compounds against Î±-amylase enzyme inhibitory activity, respectively. DPPH-free radical scavenging and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays were used to assess the in vitro antioxidant potential.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>In this work, nine heterocyclic analogs derived from curcumin precursors under ultrasonic irradiation were synthesized in excellent yields (81.4-93.7%) with improved reaction time. Results of antibacterial activities revealed that compounds 8, and 11 displayed mean inhibition zone of 13.00Â±0.57, and 19.66Â±00 mm, respectively, compared to amoxicillin (12.87Â±1.41 mm) at 500 Î¼g/mL against <i>E. coli</i>, while compounds 8, 11 and 16 displayed mean inhibition zone of 17.67Â±0.57, 14.33Â±0.57 and 23.33Â±00 mm, respectively, compared to amoxicillin (13.75Â±1.83 mm) at 500 Î¼g/mL against <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Compound 11 displayed a mean inhibition zone of 11.33Â±0.57 mm compared to amoxicillin (10.75Â±1.83 mm) at 500 Î¼g/mL against <i>S. aureus</i>. Compound 11 displayed higher binding affinities of -7.5 and -8.3 Kcal/mol with penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and <i>Î²</i>-lactamases producing bacterial strains, compared to amoxicillin (-7.2 and -7.9 Kcal/mol, respectively), these results are in good agreement with the in vitro antibacterial activities. In vitro antidiabetic potential on <i>Î±</i>-amylase enzyme revealed that compounds 11 (IC<sub>50</sub>=7.59 Âµg/mL) and 16 (IC<sub>50</sub>=4.08 Âµg/mL) have higher inhibitory activities than acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub>=8.0 Âµg/mL). Compound 8 showed promising antioxidant inhibition efficacy of DPPH (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.44 g/mL) compared to ascorbic acid (IC<sub>50</sub>=1.24 g/mL), while compound 16 revealed 89.9Â±20.42% inhibition of peroxide generation showing its potential in reducing the development of lipid peroxides. In silico molecular docking analysis, results are in good agreement with in vitro biological activity. In silico ADMET profiles suggested the adequate oral drug-likeness potential of the compounds without adverse effects.<h4>Conclusion</h4>According to our findings, both biological activities and in silico computational studies results demonstrated that compounds 8, 11, and 16 are promising <i>Î±</i>-amylase inhibitors and antibacterial agents against <i>E. coli</i>, <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and <i>S. aureus</i>, whereas compound 8 was found to be a promising antioxidant agent.",

The study emphasized the potential risk to human health of such human pathogenic or commensal bacteria, being transferred via food chain or horizontally transferred to human clinical isolates. The top highly abundant rhizospheric soil non-redundant ARGs that are prevalent in bacterial human pathogens or colonizers (commensal) included mtrA, soxR, vanRO, golS, rbpA, kdpE, rpoB2, arr-1, efrA and ileS genes.

In this study, we establish a method to harvest RNA from fungal monocultures and fungal-methanogen co-cultures, and also determine an optimal time frame for high-quality RNA extraction from anaerobic fungi. Based on RNA quality and quantity targets, the optimal time frame in which to harvest anaerobic fungal monocultures and fungal-methanogen co-cultures for RNA extraction was 2-5 days of growth post-inoculation.

        "pmc_abstract": "To identify the potential role of the 3-hydroxyl group of the pyridine ring in nosiheptide (NOS) for its antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, enzymatic glycosylation was utilized to regio-selectively create a monoglycosyl NOS derivative, NOS-G. For this purpose, we selected OleD, a UDP glycosyltransferase from Streptomyces antibioticus that has a low productivity for NOS-G. Activity of the enzyme was increased by swapping domains derived from OleI, both single and in combination. Activity enhancement was best in mutant OleD-10 that contained four OleI domains. This chimer was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis (single and in combination) to increase its activity further, whereby variants were screened using a newly-established colorimetric assay. OleD-10 with I117F and T118G substitutions (FG) had an increased NOS-G productivity of 56%, approximately 70 times higher than that of wild-type OleD. The reason for improved activity of FG towards NOS was structurally attributed to a closer distance (<3âÃ) between NOS/sugar donor and the catalytic amino acid H25. The engineered enzyme allowed sufficient activity to demonstrate that the produced NOS-G had enhanced stability and aqueous solubility compared to NOS. Using a murine MRSA infection model, it was established that NOS-G resulted in partial protection within 20âh of administration and delayed the death of infected mice. We conclude that 3-hydroxypyridine is a promising site for structural modification of NOS, which may pave the way for producing nosiheptide derivatives as a potential antibiotic for application in clinical treatment.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Lasso peptides are ribosomally synthesized peptides that undergo post-translational modifications including leader peptide removal by B (or the segregated B1 and B2) proteins and core peptide macrolactamization by C proteins to form a unique lariat topology. A conserved threonine residue at the penultimate position of leader peptide is hitherto found in lasso peptide precursors and shown to be a critical recognition element for effective enzymatic processing. We identified a lasso peptide biosynthetic gene cluster (<i>bsf</i>) from <i>Bradymonas sediminis</i> FA350, a Gram-negative and facultatively prey-dependent bacterium that belongs to a novel bacterial order <i>Bradymonadales</i> in the class <i>Deltaproteobacteria</i>. The kinase BsfK specifically catalyzes the phosphorylation of the precursor peptide BsfA on the Ser3 residue. BsfB1 performs dual functions to accelerate the post-translational phosphorylation and assist BsfB2 in leader peptide removal. Most importantly, the penultimate residue of leader peptide is an isoleucine rather than the conserved threonine and this isoleucine has a marked impact on the phosphorylation of Ser3 as well as leader peptide removal, implying that BsfB1 and BsfB2 exhibit a new substrate selectivity for leader peptide binding and excision. This is the first experimentally validated penultimate isoleucine residue in a lasso peptide precursor to our knowledge. <i>In silico</i> analysis reveals that the leader peptide Ile/Val(-2) residue is rare but not uncommon in phosphorylated lasso peptides, as this residue is also discovered in <i>Acidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Sphingomonadales</i> in addition to <i>Bradymonadales</i>.",

To improve the fermentation titer of tylosin in the hyperproducing <i>Streptomyces xinghaiensis</i> strain TL01, we sequenced its whole genome and identified the biosynthetic gene cluster therein. Overexpression of the tylosin efflux gene <i>tlrC</i>, the <b>c</b>luster-<b>s</b>ituated <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine (SAM) synthetase gene <i>metK</i><sub><i>cs</i></sub>, the SAM biosynthetic genes <i>adoK</i><sub><i>cs</i></sub>-<i>metF</i><sub><i>cs</i></sub>, or the pathway-specific activator gene <i>tylR</i> enhanced tylosin production by 18%, 12%, 11%, and 11% in the respective engineered strains TLPH08-2, TLPH09, TLPH10, and TLPH12. Co-overexpression of <i>metK</i><sub><i>cs</i></sub> and <i>adoK</i><sub><i>cs</i></sub>-<i>metF</i><sub><i>cs</i></sub> as two transcripts increased tylosin production by 22% in the resultant strain TLPH11 compared to that in TL01. Furthermore, combinational overexpression of <i>tlrC</i>, <i>metK</i><sub><i>cs</i></sub>, <i>adoK</i><sub><i>cs</i></sub>-<i>metF</i><sub><i>cs</i></sub>, and <i>tylR</i> as four transcripts increased tylosin production by 23% (10.93g/L) in the resultant strain TLPH17 compared to that in TL01. However, a negligible additive effect was displayed upon combinational overexpression in TLPH17 as suggested by the limited increment of fermentation titer compared to that in TLPH08-2. Transcription analyses indicated that the expression of <i>tlrC</i> and three SAM biosynthetic genes in TLPH17 was considerably lower than that of TLPH08-2 and TLPH11. Based on this observation, the five genes were rearranged into one or two operons to coordinate their overexpression, yielding two engineered strains TLPH23 and TLPH24, and leading to further enhancement of tylosin production over TLPH17. In particular, the production of TLPH23 reached 11.35Â g/L. These findings indicated that the combinatorial strategy is a promising approach for enhancing tylosin production in high-yielding industrial strains.",

On the other hand, they are widely used as pharmaceutically significant drugs, such as antibiotics, statins, and immunosuppressants. A single fungus species in response to various signals can produce 100 or more secondary metabolites. Such signaling is possible due to the coordinated regulation of several dozen biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which are mosaically localized in different regions of fungal chromosomes. Their regulation includes several levels, from pathway-specific regulators, whose genes are localized inside BGCs, to global regulators of the cell (taking into account changes in pH, carbon consumption, etc.) and global regulators of secondary metabolism (affecting epigenetic changes driven by velvet family proteins, LaeA, etc.). In addition, various low-molecular-weight substances can have a mediating effect on such regulatory processes. This review is devoted to a critical analysis of the available data on the \"turning on\" and \"off\" of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in response to signals in filamentous fungi. To describe the ongoing processes, the model of \"piano regulation\" is proposed, whereby pressing a certain key (signal) leads to the extraction of a certain sound from the \"musical instrument of the fungus cell\", which is expressed in the production of a specific secondary metabolite.",

        "pmc_abstract": "There is an urgent need to diversify the pipeline for discovering novel natural products due to the increase in multi-drug resistant infections. Like bacteria, fungi also produce secondary metabolites that have potent bioactivity and rich chemical diversity. To avoid self-toxicity, fungi encode resistance genes which are often present within the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of the corresponding bioactive compounds. Recent advances in genome mining tools have enabled the detection and prediction of BGCs responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The main challenge now is to prioritize the most promising BGCs that produce bioactive compounds with novel modes of action. With target-directed genome mining methods, it is possible to predict the mode of action of a compound encoded in an uncharacterized BGC based on the presence of resistant target genes. Here, we introduce the 'fungal bioactive compound resistant target seeker' (FunARTS) available at https://funarts.ziemertlab.com. This is a specific and efficient mining tool for the identification of fungal bioactive compounds with interesting and novel targets. FunARTS rapidly links housekeeping and known resistance genes to BGC proximity and duplication events, allowing for automated, target-directed mining of fungal genomes. Additionally, FunARTS generates gene cluster networking by comparing the similarity of BGCs from multi-genomes.",

Here, we combine genetic and structural approaches to determine the regulation of streptococcal ARE ABC-F gene msrD in response to macrolide exposure. We show that binding of cladinose-containing macrolides to the ribosome prompts insertion of the leader peptide MsrDL into a crevice of the ribosomal exit tunnel, which is conserved throughout bacteria and eukaryotes. This leads to a local rearrangement of the 23âS rRNA that prevents peptide bond formation and accommodation of release factors. The stalled ribosome obstructs the formation of a Rho-independent terminator structure that prevents msrD transcriptional attenuation. Erythromycin induction of msrD expression via MsrDL, is suppressed by ectopic expression of mrsD, but not by mutants which do not provide antibiotic resistance, showing correlation between MsrD function in antibiotic resistance and its action on this stalled complex.",

Its effectiveness is increasingly challenged by the spread of genes coding for TMP-resistant dihydrofolate reductases: dfrA, and the lesser-known, evolutionarily unrelated dfrB. Despite recent reports of novel variants conferring high level TMP resistance (dfrB10 to dfrB21), the prevalence of dfrB is still unknown due to underreporting, heterogeneity of the analyzed genetic material in terms of isolation sources, and limited bioinformatic processing. In this study, we explored a coherent set of shotgun metagenomic sequences to quantitatively estimate the abundance of dfrB gene variants in aquatic environments. Specifically, we scanned sequences originating from influents and effluents of municipal sewage treatment plants as well as river-borne microbiomes. Our analyses reveal an increased prevalence of dfrB1, dfrB2, dfrB3, dfrB4, dfrB5, and dfrB7 in wastewater microbiomes as compared to freshwater. These gene variants were frequently found in genomic neighborship with other resistance genes, transposable elements, and integrons, indicating their mobility. By contrast, the relative abundances of the more recently discovered variants dfrB9, dfrB10, and dfrB13 were significantly higher in freshwater than in wastewater microbiomes. Moreover, their direct neighborship with other resistance genes or markers of mobile genetic elements was significantly less likely. Our findings suggest that natural freshwater communities form a major reservoir of the recently discovered dfrB gene variants. Their proliferation and mobilization in response to the exposure of freshwater communities to selective TMP concentrations may promote the prevalence of high-level TMP resistance and thus limit the future effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies.",

This may be about to change with new commercial players entering the market aiming to apply novel genomic tools to streamline the discovery process. This review examines the discovery history of approved fungal-derived drugs, and those currently in clinical trials for chronic diseases. For key molecules, we discuss their possible ecological functions in nature and how this relates to their use in human medicine. We show how the conservation of drug receptors between fungi and humans means that metabolites intended to inhibit competitor fungi often interact with human drug receptors, sometimes with unintended benefits. We also plot the distribution of drugs, antimicrobial compounds and psychoactive mushrooms onto a fungal tree and compare their distribution to those of all fungal metabolites. Finally, we examine the phenomenon of self-resistance and how this can be used to help predict metabolite mechanism of action and aid the drug discovery process.",

A large number of studies have shown that the human body can be influenced in its immune regulation, energy metabolism and expression of biological-clock genes through diet, including fasting, and exercise, with intestinal flora as the vector, thereby reducing the incidence rates of diseases.

While several members of this family are used in agriculture (e.g., as anti-coccidiostats) and have potent antibacterial activity, they are not currently being pursued as antibiotics for human use. Polyether ionophores are typically grouped as having similar functions, despite the fact that they significantly differ in structure; for this reason, how their structure and activity are related remains unclear. To determine whether certain members of the family constitute particularly interesting springboards for in-depth investigations and future synthetic optimization, we conducted a systematic comparative study of eight different polyether ionophores for their potential as antibiotics. This includes clinical isolates from bloodstream infections and studies of the compounds' effects on bacterial biofilms and persister cells. We uncover distinct differences within the compound class and identify the compounds lasalocid, calcimycin, and nanchangmycin as having particularly interesting activity profiles for further development. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Polyether ionophores are complex natural products used in agriculture as anti-coccidiostats in poultry and as growth promoters in cattle, although their precise mechanism is not understood. They are widely regarded as antimicrobials against Gram-positive bacteria and protozoa, but fear of toxicity has so far prevented their use in humans. We show that ionophores generally have very different effects on Staphylococcus aureus, both in standard assays and in more complex systems such as bacterial biofilms and persister cell populations. This will allow us to focus on the most interesting compounds for future in-depth investigations and synthetic optimizations.",

These microbes invade the body via food items, through numerous mediums of contamination and it is impossible to completely eradicate these organisms from food. Extensive research has been made regarding their treatment. Unfortunately, the only available treatment currently is by antibiotics. Recent exponential increase in antibiotic resistance and the side effect of synthetic compounds have established a need for alternate therapies that could be utilized either on their own or along with antibiotics to provide protection against food-borne diseases. The aim of this review is to provide information regarding some common food borne diseases, their current and possible natural treatment. It will include details regarding some common foodborne pathogens, the disease they cause, prevalence, manifestations and treatment of the respective disease. Some natural modes of potential treatment will be summarized, which including phytochemicals, derived from plants either as crude extracts or as purified form and Bacteriocins as microbial based treatment, obtained from various types of bacteria. The paper will describe their mechanism of action, classification, susceptible organisms, some antimicrobial compounds and producing organisms, application in food systems and as potential treatment. Along with that, synthetic treatment i.e., antibiotics will be discussed including the first-line treatment of some common food borne infections, prevalence and mechanism of resistance against antibiotics in the pathogens.",

This strain possesses several active carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes involved in glycogen and trehalose metabolism. Additionally, two specific genes associated with Î±-galactosidase (GH36) and bacterial alpha-1,2-mannosidase (GH92) were identified in this strain. The presence of these genes indicates the likelihood that they can be expressed, enabling the strain to break down specific polysaccharides derived from plants or the shells of nearby crabs. The authors performed a comparative analysis of CAZyme patterns and biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in several <i>Subtercola</i> strains and provided annotations describing the unique characteristics of these strains. The comparative analysis of BGCs revealed that four strains, including PAMC28395, have oligosaccharide BGCs, and we confirmed that the pentose phosphate pathway was configured perfectly in the genome of PAMC28395, which may be associated with adaptation to low temperatures. Additionally, all strains contained antibiotic resistance genes, indicating a complex self-resistance system. These results suggest that PAMC28395 can adapt quickly to the cold environment and produce energy autonomously. This study provides valuable information on novel functional enzymes, particularly CAZymes, that operate at low temperatures and can be used for biotechnological applications and fundamental research purposes.",

Previous structureâactivity relationships indicated that triple halogenated depsidones display the best anti-pathogenic activity. However, the gene cluster and the tailoring steps responsible for halogenated depsidone nornidulin (<b>3</b>) remain enigmatic. In this study, we disclosed the complete biosynthetic pathway of the halogenated depsidone through <i>inÂ vivo</i> gene disruption, heterologous expression and <i>inÂ vitro</i> biochemical experiments. We demonstrated an unusual depside skeleton biosynthesis process mediated by both highly-reducing polyketide synthase and non-reducing polyketide synthase, which is distinct from the common depside skeleton biosynthesis. This skeleton was subsequently modified by two in-cluster enzymes DepG and DepF for the ether bond formation and decarboxylation, respectively. In addition, the decarboxylase DepF exhibited substrate promiscuity for different scaffold substrates. Finally, and interestingly, we discovered a halogenase encoded remotely from the biosynthetic gene cluster, which catalyzes triple-halogenation to produce the active end product nornidulin (<b>3</b>).

Mining the genomic data in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, our updated catalogue (https://orphanpkscatalog2022.stanford.edu/catalog) presented in this article revealed 8799 non-redundant assembly line polyketide synthase clusters across 4083 species, representing a threefold increase over the past 4 years.

        "pmc_abstract": "Myxin, a di-<i>N</i>-oxide phenazine isolated from the soil bacterium Lysobacter antibioticus, exhibits potent activity against various microorganisms and has the potential to be developed as an agrochemical. Antibiotic-producing microorganisms have developed self-resistance mechanisms to protect themselves from autotoxicity. Antibiotic efflux is vital for such protection. Recently, we identified a resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump, LexABC, involved in self-resistance against myxin in <i>L. antibioticus</i>. Expression of its genes, <i>lexABC</i>, was induced by myxin and was positively regulated by the LysR family transcriptional regulator LexR. The molecular mechanisms, however, have not been clear. Here, LexR was found to bind to the <i>lexABC</i> promoter region to directly regulate expression. Moreover, myxin enhanced this binding. Molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that myxin bound LexR with valine and lysine residues at positions 146 (V146) and 195 (K195), respectively. Furthermore, mutation of K195 <i>in vivo</i> led to downregulation of the gene <i>lexA</i>. These results indicated that LexR sensed and bound with myxin, thereby directly activating the expression of the LexABC efflux pump and increasing <i>L. antibioticus</i> resistance against myxin. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Antibiotic-producing bacteria exhibit various sophisticated mechanisms for self-protection against their own secondary metabolites. RND efflux pumps that eliminate antibiotics from cells are ubiquitous in Gram-negative bacteria. Myxin is a heterocyclic <i>N</i>-oxide phenazine with potent antimicrobial and antitumor activities produced by the soil bacterium <i>L. antibioticus</i>. The RND pump LexABC contributes to the self-resistance of <i>L. antibioticus</i> against myxin. Herein, we report a mechanism involving the LysR family regulator LexR that binds to myxin and directly activates the LexABC pump. Further study on self-resistance mechanisms could help the investigation of strategies to deal with increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance and enable the discovery of novel natural products with resistance genes as selective markers.",

The amino acid sequence alignment of ThnA revealed similarities with a previously identified type III PKS and identified Cys<sup>138</sup>, Phe<sup>188</sup>, His<sup>270</sup>, and Asn<sup>303</sup> as four highly conserved active site amino acid residues, as found in other known polyketide synthases. In this study, we report the heterologous expression of the type III polyketide synthase <i>thnA</i> in <i>S. lividans</i> TK24 and the identification of THN production in a mutant strain. We also compared the transcription level of <i>thnA</i> in <i>S. lividans</i> TK24 and <i>S. lividans</i> pIBR25-thnA and found that <i>thnA</i> was only transcribed in the mutant.",

Staphylococcus aureus remains a formidable human pathogen with high mortality rates associated with severe systemic infections. S. aureus has become notorious as a multidrug resistant bacterium, which when combined with its extensive arsenal of virulence factors that exacerbate disease, culminates in an incredibly challenging pathogen to treat clinically. Compounding this major health issue is the lack of antibiotic discovery and development, with only two new classes of antibiotics approved for clinical use in the last 20âyears. Combined efforts from the scientific community have reacted to the threat of dwindling treatment options to combat S. aureus disease in several innovative and exciting developments. This review describes current and future antimicrobial strategies aimed at treating staphylococcal colonization and/or disease, examining therapies that show significant promise at the preclinical development stage to approaches that are currently being investigated in clinical trials.",

The biosynthesis of these compounds is often highly regulated with many natural products (NPs) being produced at very low levels in laboratory settings. Environmental factors, such as small molecule elicitors, can induce the production of secondary metabolites. Specifically, they can increase titers of known NPs as well as enabling discovery of novel NPs typically produced at undetectable levels. These elicitors can be NPs, including antibiotics or hormones, or synthetic compounds. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of small molecule elicitors to induce the production of secondary metabolites from actinobacteria, especially for the discovery of NPs from \"silent\" biosynthetic gene clusters. This review aims to highlight classes of molecules that induce secondary metabolite production in actinobacteria and to describe the potential mechanisms of induction.<h4>One-sentence summary</h4>This review describes chemical elicitors of actinobacteria natural products described to date and the proposed mechanisms of induction.",

        "pmc_abstract": "DoxA is a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase involved in the late stages of daunorubicin and doxorubicin biosynthesis that has a broad substrate specificity for anthracycline glycone substrates. Recombinant DoxA was purified to homogeneity from Streptomyces lividans transformed with a plasmid containing the Streptomyces sp. strain C5 doxA gene under the control of the strong SnpR-activated snpA promoter. The purified enzyme was a monomeric, soluble protein with an apparent Mr of 47,000. Purified DoxA catalyzed the 13-hydroxylation of 13-deoxydaunorubicin, the 13-oxidation of 13-dihydrocarminomycin and 13-dihydrodaunorubicin, and the 14-hydroxylation of daunorubicin. The pH optimum for heme activation was pH 7.5, and the temperature optimum was 30 degreesC. The kcat/Km values for the oxidation of anthracycline substrates by purified DoxA, incubated with appropriate electron-donating components, were as follows: for 13-deoxydaunorubicin, 22,000 M-1 x s-1; for 13-dihydrodaunorubicin, 14,000 M-1 x s-1; for 13-dihydrocarminomycin, 280 M-1 x s-1; and for daunorubicin, 130 M-1 x s-1. Our results indicate that the conversion of daunorubicin to doxorubicin by this enzyme is not a favored reaction and that the main anthracycline flux through the late steps of the daunorubicin biosynthetic pathway catalyzed by DoxA is likely directed through the 4-O-methyl series of anthracyclines.",

These five genes were characterized by sequence analysis, and the effects of replacing dnrU, dnrV, doxA, or dpsH with mutant alleles and of doxA overexpression on the production of the principal anthracycline metabolites of S. peucetius were studied. The exact roles of dpsH and dnrV could not be established, although dnrV is implicated in the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by DoxA, but dnrU appears to encode a ketoreductase specific for the C-13 carbonyl of daunorubicin (DNR) and DXR or their biosynthetic precursors. The highest DXR titers were obtained in a dnrX dnrU (N. Lomovskaya, Y. Doi-Katayama, S. Filippini, C. Nastro, L. Fonstein, M. Gallo, A. L. Colombo, and C. R. Hutchinson, J.

Overexpression of doxA in a doxA::aphII mutant resulted in the accumulation of DXR precursors instead of in a notable increase in DXR production. In contrast, overexpression of dnrV and doxA jointly in the dnrX dnrU double mutant or the dnrX dnrU dnrH triple mutant increased the DXR titer 36 to 86%.",

Bacteria attain MDR by different means such as antibiotic modification/degradation, target protection/modification/bypass, and enhanced efflux mechanisms. The classical approaches of counteracting MDR bacteria are expensive and time-consuming, thus, it is highly significant to understand the molecular mechanisms of this resistance to curb the problem from core level. The revolutionary approach of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated sequence 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), considered as a next-generation genome-editing tool presents an innovative opportunity to precisely target and edit bacterial genome to alter their MDR strategy. Different bacteria possessing antibiotic resistance genes such as <i>mec</i>A, <i>erm</i>B, <i>ram</i>R, <i>tet</i>A, <i>mqr</i>B and <i>bla</i><sub>KPC</sub> that have been targeted by CRISPR/Cas9 to re-sensitize these pathogens against antibiotics, such as methicillin, erythromycin, tigecycline, colistin and carbapenem, respectively. The CRISPR/Cas9 from <i>S. pyogenes</i> is the most widely studied genome-editing tool, consisting of a Cas9 DNA endonuclease associated with tracrRNA and crRNA, which can be systematically coupled as sgRNA. The targeting strategies of CRISPR/Cas9 to bacterial cells is mediated through phage, plasmids, vesicles and nanoparticles. However, the targeting approaches of this genome-editing tool to specific bacteria is a challenging task and still remains at a very preliminary stage due to numerous obstacles awaiting to beÂ solved. This review elaborates some recent updates about the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and the innovative role of CRISPR/Cas9 system in modulating these resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, the delivery approaches of this genome-editing system in bacterial cells are discussed. In addition, some challenges and future prospects are also described.",

This so-called two-component system plays a decisive role in the chemical defence of various plants. Here, we discovered that Panax notoginseng, a valuable medicinal plant, has evolved a two-component chemical defence system composed of a chloroplast-localized Î²-glucosidase, denominated PnGH1, and its substrates 20(S)-protopanaxadiol ginsenosides. The Î²-glucosidase and its substrates are spatially separated in cells under physiological conditions, and ginsenoside hydrolysis is therefore activated only upon chloroplast disruption, which is caused by the induced exoenzymes of pathogenic fungi upon exposure to plant leaves. This activation of PnGH1-mediated hydrolysis results in the production of a series of less-polar ginsenosides by selective hydrolysis of an outer glucose at the C-3 site, with a broader spectrum and more potent antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo than the precursor molecules. Furthermore, such Î²-glucosidase-mediated hydrolysis upon fungal infection was also found in the congeneric species P. quinquefolium and P. ginseng. Our findings reveal a two-component chemical defence system in Panax species and offer insights for developing botanical pesticides for disease management in Panax species.",

We measured the PYO-created inhibition zone and found that only an overexpression of NorA reduced <i>S. aureus</i> susceptibility to pyocyanin killing. The MIC<sub>PYO</sub> of the NorA overexpressor increased threefold compared to that of wild-type RN6390 and was reduced 2.5-fold with reserpine, suggesting that increased NorA efflux caused PYO resistance. The PYO-created inhibition zone of a <i>ÎnorA</i> mutant was consistently larger than that of a plasmid-borne NorA overexpressor. PYO also produced a modest increase in <i>norA</i> expression (1.8-fold at 0.25 Âµg/mL PYO) that gradually decreased with increasing PYO concentrations. Well diffusion assays carried out using <i>P. aeruginosa</i> showed that <i>ÎnorA</i> mutant was less susceptible to killing by PYO-deficient mutants PA14<i><sub>phzM</sub></i> and PA14<i><sub>phzS</sub></i> than to killing by PA14. NorA overexpression led to reduced killing by all tested <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. We evaluated the NorA-PYO interaction using a collection of 22 clinical isolates from adult and pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, which included both <i>S. aureus</i> (CF-SA) and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (CF-PA). We found that when isolated alone, CF-PA and CF-SA expressed varying levels of PYO and <i>norA</i> transcripts, but all four CF-PA/CF-SA pairs isolated concurrently from CF patients produced a low level of PYO and low <i>norA</i> transcript levels, respectively, suggesting a partial adaptation of the two bacteria in circumstances of persistent co-colonization.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The biosynthesis of bioactive secondary metabolites, specifically antibiotics, is of great scientific and economic importance. The control of antibiotic production typically involves different processes and molecular mechanism. Despite numerous efforts to improve antibiotic yields, joint engineering strategies for combining genetic manipulation with fermentation optimization remain finite. Lincomycin A (Lin-A), a lincosamide antibiotic, is industrially fermented by <i>Streptomyces lincolnensis</i>. Herein, the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp)-type regulator SLCG_4846 was confirmed to directly inhibit the lincomycin biosynthesis, whereas indirectly controlled the transcription of <i>SLCG_2919</i>, the first reported repressor in <i>S. lincolnensis</i>. Inactivation of <i>SLCG_4846</i> in the high-yield <i>S. lincolnensis</i> LA219X (LA219XÎ<i>4846</i>) increases the Lin-A production and deletion of <i>SLCG_2919</i> in LA219XÎ<i>4846</i> exhibits superimposed yield increment. Given the effect of the double deletion on cellular primary metabolism of <i>S. lincolnensis</i>, Plackett-Burman design, steepest ascent and response surface methodologies were utilized and employed to optimize the seed medium of this double mutant in shake flask, and Lin-A yield using optimal seed medium was significantly increased over the control. Above strategies were performed in a 15-L fermenter. The maximal yield of Lin-A in LA219XÎ<i>4846-2919</i> reached 6.56Â g/L at 216Â h, 55.1 % higher than that in LA219X at the parental cultivation (4.23Â g/L).

Trichomes, developed from epidermal cells, have a role in defense against insect attack, and their secretions are of non-negligible value. Here, we found that the glandular heads of type VI trichomes were clearly distinguishable between AC and SH under cryo-scanning electron microscopy, the difference indicating that SH could secrete more anti-insect metabolites than AC. Pest preference experiments showed that aphids and mites preferred to feed near AC compared with SH. Integration analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics data revealed that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway was an important secondary metabolic pathway in plants, and SH secreted larger amounts of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids than AC by upregulating the expression of relevant genes in this pathway, and this may contribute to the greater resistance of SH to phytophagous insects. Notably, virus-induced silencing of <i>Sl4CLL6</i> not only decreased the expression of genes downstream of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway (<i>SlHCT</i>, <i>SlCAD</i>, and <i>SlCHI</i>), but also reduced resistance to mites in tomato. These findings provided new genetic resources for the synthesis of phenylpropanoid compounds and anti-insect breeding in <i>S. habrochaites</i> and a new theoretical basis for the improvement of important traits in cultivated tomato.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Fungal secondary metabolites (SMs) contribute to the diversity of fungal ecological communities, niches, and lifestyles. Many fungal SMs have one or more medically and industrially important activities (e.g., antifungal, antibacterial, and antitumor). The genes necessary for fungal SM biosynthesis are typically located right next to each other in the genome and are known as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, whether fungal SM bioactivity can be predicted from specific attributes of genes in BGCs remains an open question. We adapted machine learning models that predicted SM bioactivity from bacterial BGC data with accuracies as high as 80% to fungal BGC data. We trained our models to predict the antibacterial, antifungal, and cytotoxic/antitumor bioactivity of fungal SMs on two data sets: (i) fungal BGCs (data set comprised of 314 BGCs) and (ii) fungal (314 BGCs) and bacterial BGCs (1,003 BGCs). We found that models trained on fungal BGCs had balanced accuracies between 51% and 68%, whereas training on bacterial and fungal BGCs had balanced accuracies between 56% and 68%. The low prediction accuracy of fungal SM bioactivities likely stems from the small size of the data set; this lack of data, coupled with our finding that including bacterial BGC data in the training data did not substantially change accuracies currently limits the application of machine learning approaches to fungal SM studies. With >15,000 characterized fungal SMs, millions of putative BGCs in fungal genomes, and increased demand for novel drugs, efforts that systematically link fungal SM bioactivity to BGCs are urgently needed.IMPORTANCEFungi are key sources of natural products and iconic drugs, including penicillin and statins. DNA sequencing has revealed that there are likely millions of biosynthetic pathways in fungal genomes, but the chemical structures and bioactivities of >99% of natural products produced by these pathways remain unknown. We used artificial intelligence to predict the bioactivities of diverse fungal biosynthetic pathways. We found that the accuracies of our predictions were generally low, between 51% and 68%, likely because the natural products and bioactivities of only very few fungal pathways are known. With >15,000 characterized fungal natural products, millions of putative biosynthetic pathways present in fungal genomes, and increased demand for novel drugs, our study suggests that there is an urgent need for efforts that systematically identify fungal biosynthetic pathways, their natural products, and their bioactivities.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Antibiotics biosynthesis is usually regulated by the cluster-situated regulatory gene(s) (CSRG(s)), which directly regulate the genes within the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). Previously, we have demonstrated that LmbU functions as a cluster-situated regulator (CSR) of lincomycin. And it has been found that LmbU regulates twenty non-lmb genes through comparative transcriptomic analysis. However, the regulatory mode of CSRs' targets outside the BGC remains unknown.<h4>Results</h4>We screened the targets of LmbU in the whole genome of Streptomyces lincolnensis and found fourteen candidate targets, among which, eight targets can bind to LmbU by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Reporter assays in vivo revealed that LmbU repressed the transcription of SLINC_0469 and SLINC_1037 while activating the transcription of SLINC_8097. In addition, disruptions of SLINC_0469, SLINC_1037, and SLINC_8097 promoted the production of lincomycin, and qRT-PCR showed that SLINC_0469, SLINC_1037, and SLINC_8097 inhibited transcription of the lmb genes, indicating that all the three regulators can negatively regulate lincomycin biosynthesis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LmbU can directly regulate genes outside the lmb cluster, and these genes can affect both lincomycin biosynthesis and the transcription of lmb genes. Our results first erected the cascade regulatory circuit of LmbU and regulators outside lmb cluster, which provides the theoretical basis for the functional research of LmbU family proteins.",

        "pmc_abstract": "There has been a widespread adoption of hypomethylating agents (HMA: 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza)/decitabine) and venetoclax (Ven) for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, the mechanisms behind the combination's synergy are poorly understood. Monotherapy often encounters resistance, leading to suboptimal outcomes; however, the combination of HMA and Ven has demonstrated substantial improvements in treatment responses. This study elucidates multiple synergistic pathways contributing to this enhanced therapeutic effect. Key mechanisms include HMA-mediated downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, notably MCL-1, and the priming of cells for Ven through the induction of genes encoding pro-apoptotic proteins such as Noxa. Moreover, Ven induces sensitization to HMA, induces overcoming resistance by inhibiting the DHODH enzyme, and disrupts antioxidant pathways (Nrf2) induced by HMA. The combination further disrupts oxidative phosphorylation in leukemia stem cells, amplifying the therapeutic impact. Remarkably, clinical studies have revealed a favorable response, particularly in patients harboring specific mutations, such as <i>IDH1/2</i>, <i>NPM1</i>, <i>CEBPA</i>, or <i>ASXL1</i>. This prompts future studies to explore the nuanced underpinnings of these synergistic mechanisms in AML patients with these molecular signatures.",

To overcome this problem, novel strategies are being explored to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics. Antibiotic adjuvants have emerged as a promising approach to combat MDR pathogens by acting synergistically with antibiotics. This review focuses on the role of antibiotic adjuvants as a synergistic tool in the fight against MDR pathogens. Adjuvants refer to compounds or agents that enhance the activity of antibiotics, either by potentiating their effects or by targeting the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. The utilization of antibiotic adjuvants offers several advantages. Firstly, they can restore the effectiveness of existing antibiotics against resistant strains. Adjuvants can inhibit the mechanisms that confer resistance, making the pathogens susceptible to the action of antibiotics. Secondly, adjuvants can enhance the activity of antibiotics by improving their penetration into bacterial cells, increasing their stability, or inhibiting efflux pumps that expel antibiotics from bacterial cells. Various types of antibiotic adjuvants have been investigated, including efflux pump inhibitors, resistance-modifying agents, and compounds that disrupt bacterial biofilms. These adjuvants can act synergistically with antibiotics, resulting in increased antibacterial activity and overcoming resistance mechanisms. In conclusion, antibiotic adjuvants have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of MDR pathogens. By enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics, adjuvants offer a promising strategy to combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Further research and development in this field are crucial to harness the full potential of antibiotic adjuvants and bring them closer to clinical application.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Pathogenic biofilm formation within food processing industries raises a serious public health and safety concern, and places burdens on the economy. Biofilm formation on equipment surfaces is a rather complex phenomenon, wherein multiple steps are involved in bacterial biofilm formation. In this review we discuss the stages of biofilm formation, the existing literature on the impact of surface properties and shear stress on biofilms, types of bioreactors, and antimicrobial coatings. The review underscores the significance of prioritizing biofilm prevention strategies as a first line of defense, followed by control measures. Utilizing specific biofilm eradication strategies as opposed to a uniform approach is crucial because biofilms exhibit different behavioral outcomes even amongst the same species when the environmental conditions change. This review is geared towards biofilm researchers and food safety experts, and seeks to derive insights into the scope of biofilm formation, prevention, and control. The use of suitable bioreactors is paramount to understanding the mechanisms of biofilm formation. The findings provide useful information to researchers involved in bioreactor selection for biofilm investigation, and food processors in surfaces with novel antimicrobial coatings, which provide minimal bacterial attachment.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Protoberberine alkaloids are a group of tetracyclic isoquinoline compounds known for their well-established antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The richness and diversity of protoberberine alkaloids accumulated in the <i>Coptis</i> genus necessitate a comprehensive examination of the biosynthetic machinery to understand their ecological significance. Here, from <i>Coptis chinensis</i> we identified CcCYP719A1, which could install a methylenedioxy bridge on either ring A or ring D of the protoberberine backbone, thus diverging metabolite flux towards the biosynthesis of various protoberberine components. We also obtained CcCYP719A2 and CcCYP719A3, which underwent positive selection after diverging from CcCYP719A1 and maintained specific catalytic activity on ring D. Further, we resolved the biosynthetic pathway of jatrorrhizine by identifying two demethylases, which could also modulate protoberberine composition by removing the C-3 methyl group and methylenedioxy bridge of ring D, allowing demethylated metabolites to be redirected into different routes. Moreover, we characterized 2-<i>O</i>-methyltransferase CcOMT1 and flavin-dependent oxidase CcTHBO, respectively responsible for the commonly observed 2-<i>O</i>-methylation and aromatic ring-C assembly in protoberberine alkaloids. Overall, this study reveals an interconnected metabolite network from which diverse protoberberine alkaloids originate. It provides valuable insights into the existence of undiscovered protoberberine components, and paves the way for the targeted production of desired protoberberine components for potential therapeutic development.",

The inactivation of the SLCG_7083 gene indicated that SLCG_7083 promotes glucose utilization, slows mycelial growth and affects sporulation in S. lincolnensis. Comparative transcriptomic analysis further revealed that SLCG_7083 represses eight genes involved in sporulation, cell division and lipid metabolism, and activates two genes involved in carbon metabolism.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SLCG_7083 is a PAS domain-containing regulator on morphological development and glucose utilization in S. lincolnensis.

In this study, a new strain with high VB<sub>12</sub> production potential, Ensifer adhaerens S305, was identified in sewage. Because E. adhaerens strains have become the main strains for VB<sub>12</sub> production via fermentation in recent years, the directional modification of the S305 strain to obtain a strain suitable for the industrial production of VB<sub>12</sub> has great potential and commercial value.<h4>Results</h4>16S rRNA and genome-wide phylogenetic tree analysis combined with average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis showed that the high-yielding VB<sub>12</sub> strain was a E. adhaerens strain and that its VB<sub>12</sub> synthesis pathway genes were highly similar to related genes of strains of this and other species, including E. adhaerens Casida A, Pseudomonas denitrificans SC 510, and E. adhaerens Corn53. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) results indicated that the VB<sub>12</sub> yields of the S305 strain were more than double those of the Casida A strain under different medium components. Multiple genes with significantly upregulated and downregulated transcription were identified by comparing the transcription intensity of different genes through transcriptome sequencing. KEGG enrichment analysis of the porphyrin metabolism pathway identified 9 significantly upregulated and downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the VB<sub>12</sub> synthesis pathway, including 7 transcriptionally upregulated genes (cobA, cobT, hemA, cobJ, cobN, cobR, and cobP) that were episomally overexpressed in the Casida A strain. The results showed that the VB<sub>12</sub> yield of the overexpressed strain was higher than that of the wild-type strain. Notably, the strains overexpressing the cobA and cobT genes exhibited the most significant increases in VB<sub>12</sub> yield, i.e., 31.4% and 24.8%, respectively. The VB<sub>12</sub> yield of the S305 strain in shake-flask culture was improved from 176.6âÂ±â8.21Â mg/L to 245.6âÂ±â4.36Â mg/L by integrating the cobA and cobT genes into the strain.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Phylogenetic tree and ANI analysis showed that the Ensifer and Sinorhizobium strains were quite different at the genome level; the overexpression and integrated expression of significantly upregulated genes in the VB<sub>12</sub> synthesis pathway could increase the yield of VB<sub>12</sub>, further improving the VB<sub>12</sub> yield of the E. adhaerens S305 strain.",

Recently, we identified the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster, but systematic genetic analyses had not been carried out because of the lack of a heterologous expression system. Here, we report the discovery of a homologous cystargolide biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces durhamensis NRRL-B3309 by genome mining. The gene cluster was cloned via transformation-associated recombination and heterologously expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor M512. We demonstrate that it contains all genes necessary for the production of cystargolide A and B. Single gene deletion experiments reveal that only five of the eight genes from the initially proposed gene cluster are essential for cystargolide synthesis. Additional insights into the cystargolide pathway could be obtained from inÂ vitro assays with CysG and chemical complementation of the respective gene knockout. This could be further supported by the inÂ vitro investigation of the CysG homolog BelI from the belactosin biosynthetic gene cluster. Thereby, we confirm that CysG and BelI catalyze a cryptic SAM-dependent transfer of a methyl group that is critical for the construction of the cystargolide and belactosin Î²-lactone warheads.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antibiotics have revolutionized medicine, saving countless lives since their discovery in the early 20th century. However, the origin of antibiotics is now overshadowed by the alarming rise in antibiotic resistance. This global crisis stems from the relentless adaptability of microorganisms, driven by misuse and overuse of antibiotics. This article explores the origin of antibiotics and the subsequent emergence of antibiotic resistance. It delves into the mechanisms employed by bacteria to develop resistance, highlighting the dire consequences of drug resistance, including compromised patient care, increased mortality rates, and escalating healthcare costs. The article elucidates the latest strategies against drug-resistant microorganisms, encompassing innovative approaches such as phage therapy, CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and the exploration of natural compounds. Moreover, it examines the profound impact of antibiotic resistance on drug development, rendering the pursuit of new antibiotics economically challenging. The limitations and challenges in developing novel antibiotics are discussed, along with hurdles in the regulatory process that hinder progress in this critical field. Proposals for modifying the regulatory process to facilitate antibiotic development are presented. The withdrawal of major pharmaceutical firms from antibiotic research is examined, along with potential strategies to re-engage their interest. The article also outlines initiatives to overcome economic challenges and incentivize antibiotic development, emphasizing international collaborations and partnerships. Finally, the article sheds light on government-led initiatives against antibiotic resistance, with a specific focus on the Middle East. It discusses the proactive measures taken by governments in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to combat this global threat. In the face of antibiotic resistance, a multifaceted approach is imperative. This article provides valuable insights into the complex landscape of antibiotic development, regulatory challenges, and collaborative efforts required to ensure a future where antibiotics remain effective tools in safeguarding public health.",

The large derivatives are produced as a minor fraction, which has prevented their isolation and thus studies of chemical and biological properties.<h4>Results</h4>Herein, we describe the transcriptional engineering of the pamamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (pam BGC), which resulted in the shift in production profile toward high molecular weight derivatives. The pam BGC library was constructed by inserting randomized promoter sequences in front of key biosynthetic operons. The library was expressed in Streptomyces albus strain with improved resistance to pamamycins to overcome sensitivity-related host limitations. Clones with modified pamamycin profiles were selected and the properties of engineered pam BGC were studied in detail. The production level and composition of the mixture of pamamycins was found to depend on balance in expression of the corresponding biosynthetic genes. This approach enabled the isolation of known pamamycins and the discovery of three novel derivatives with molecular weights of 663 Da and higher. One of them, homopamamycin 677A, is the largest described representative of this family of natural products with an elucidated structure. The new pamamycin 663A shows extraordinary activity (IC50 2Â nM) against hepatocyte cancer cells as well as strong activity (in the one-digit micromolar range) against a range of Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.<h4>Conclusion</h4>By employing transcriptional gene cluster refactoring, we not only enhanced the production of known pamamycins but also discovered novel derivatives exhibiting promising biological activities. This approach has the potential for broader application in various biosynthetic gene clusters, creating a sustainable supply and discovery platform for bioactive natural products.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The huge structural diversity exhibited by plant specialized metabolites has primarily been considered to result from the catalytic specificity of their biosynthetic enzymes. Accordingly, enzyme gene multiplication and functional differentiation through spontaneous mutations have been established as the molecular mechanisms that drive metabolic evolution. Nevertheless, how plants have assembled and maintained such metabolic enzyme genes and the typical clusters that are observed in plant genomes, as well as why identical specialized metabolites often exist in phylogenetically remote lineages, is currently only poorly explained by a concept known as convergent evolution. Here, we compile recent knowledge on the co-presence of metabolic modules that are common in the plant kingdom but have evolved under specific historical and contextual constraints defined by the physicochemical properties of each plant specialized metabolite and the genetic presets of the biosynthetic genes. Furthermore, we discuss a common manner to generate uncommon metabolites (uniqueness out of uniformity) and an uncommon manner to generate common metabolites (uniqueness behind uniformity). This review describes the emerging aspects of the evolvability of plant specialized metabolism that underlie the vast structural diversity of plant specialized metabolites in nature.",

Genome mining of the Burkholderiales strain Schlegelella brevitalea DSM 7029 leads to the identification of a class of dodecapeptides, glidonins, that feature diverse N-terminal modifications and a uniform putrescine moiety at the C-terminus. The N-terminal diversity originates from the wide substrate selectivity of the initiation module. The C-terminal putrescine moiety is introduced by the unusual termination module 13, the condensation domain directly catalyzes the assembly of putrescine into the peptidyl backbone, and other domains are essential for stabilizing the protein structure. Swapping of this module to another two nonribosomal peptide synthetases leads to the addition of a putrescine to the C-terminus of related nonribosomal peptides, improving their hydrophilicity and bioactivity. This study elucidates the mechanism for putrescine addition and provides further insights to generate diverse and improved nonribosomal peptides by introducing a C-terminal putrescine.",

Here, we isolated a soil bacterium, BP9, which has significant antibiosis activity against fungal and bacterial pathogens. BP9 improved the growth of wheat seedlings via active colonization and demonstrated effective biofilm and swarming activity. BP9 sequenced genome contains 4282 genes with a mean G-C content of 45.94% of the whole genome. A single copy concatenated 802 core genes of 28 genomes, and their calculated average nucleotide identity (ANI) discriminated the strain BP9 from <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> and classified it as <i>Bacillus paralicheniformis</i>. Furthermore, a comparative pan-genome analysis of 40 <i>B. paralicheniformis</i> strains suggested that the genetic repertoire of BP9 belongs to open-type genome species. A comparative analysis of a pan-genome dataset using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Cluster of Orthologous Gene groups (COG) revealed the diversity of secondary metabolic pathways, where BP9 distinguishes itself by exhibiting a greater prevalence of loci associated with the metabolism and transportation of organic and inorganic substances, carbohydrate and amino acid for effective inhabitation in diverse environments. The primary secondary metabolites and their genes involved in synthesizing bacillibactin, fencing, bacitracin, and lantibiotics were identified as acquired through a recent Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event, which contributes to a significant part of the strain`s antimicrobial potential. Finally, we report some genes essential for plant-host interaction identified in BP9, which reduce spore germination and virulence of multiple fungal and bacterial species. The effective colonization, diverse predicted metabolic pathways and secondary metabolites (antibiotics) suggest testing the suitability of strain BP9 as a potential bio-preparation in agricultural fields.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Crop productivity can be obstructed by various biotic and abiotic stresses and thus these stresses are a threat to universal food security. The information on the use of viruses providing efficacy to plants facing growth challenges owing to stress is lacking. The role of induction of pathogen-related genes by microbes is also colossal in drought-endurance acquisition. Studies put forward the importance of viruses as sustainable means for defending plants against dual stress. A fundamental part of research focuses on a positive interplay between viruses and plants. Notably, the tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) possess the capacity to safeguard tomato host plants against severe drought conditions. This study aims to explore the combined effects of TYLCV, ToCV, and drought stress on two tomato cultivars, Money Maker (MK, UK) and Shalala (SH, Azerbaijan). The expression of pathogen-related four cellulose synthase gene families (CesA/Csl) which have been implicated in drought and virus resistance based on gene expression analysis, was assessed using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method. The molecular tests revealed significant upregulation of Ces-A2, Csl-D3,2, and Csl-D3,1 genes in TYLCV and ToCV-infected tomato plants. CesA/Csl genes, responsible for biosynthesis within the MK and SH tomato cultivars, play a role in defending against TYLCV and ToCV. Additionally, physiological parameters such as \"relative water content,\" \"specific leaf weight,\" \"leaf area,\" and \"dry biomass\" were measured in dual-stressed tomatoes. Using these features, it might be possible to cultivate TYLCV-resistant plants during seasons characterized by water scarcity.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau, known as the \"Roof of the World\" and \"The Third Pole\", harbors numerous saline lakes primarily distributed in the Northern Tibetan Plateau. However, the challenging conditions of high altitude, low oxygen level, and harsh climate have limited investigations into the actinobacteria from these saline lakes. This study focuses on investigating the biodiversity and bioactive secondary metabolites of cultivable actinobacteria isolated from the sediments of four saline lakes on the Northern Tibetan Plateau. A total of 255 actinobacterial strains affiliated with 21 genera in 12 families of 7 orders were recovered by using the pure culture technique and 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis. To facilitate a high-throughput bioactivity evaluation, 192 isolates underwent OSMAC cultivation in a miniaturized 24-well microbioreactor system (MATRIX cultivation). The antibacterial activity of crude extracts was then evaluated in a 96-well plate antibacterial assay. Forty-six strains demonstrated antagonistic effects against at least one tested pathogen, and their underlying antibacterial mechanisms were further investigated through a dual-fluorescent reporter assay (pDualrep2). Two <i>Streptomyces</i> strains (378 and 549) that produce compounds triggering DNA damage were prioritized for subsequent chemical investigations. Metabolomics profiling involving HPLC-UV/vis, UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS, and molecular networking identified three types of bioactive metabolites belonging to the aromatic polyketide family, i.e., cosmomycin, kidamycin, and hedamycin. In-depth analysis of the metabolomic data unveiled some potentially novel anthracycline compounds. A genome mining study based on the whole-genome sequences of strains 378 and 549 identified gene clusters potentially responsible for cosmomycin and kidamycin biosynthesis. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining metabolomic and genomic approaches to rapidly identify bioactive chemicals within microbial extracts. The saline lakes on the Northern Tibetan Plateau present prospective sources for discovering novel actinobacteria and biologically active compounds.",

We recently showed that the RND efflux pump DesABC in D. oryzae confers partial resistance to zeamines. To fully elucidate the bacterial self-protection mechanisms, in this study we used transposon mutagenesis to identify the genes encoding proteins involved in zeamine resistance in D. oryzae EC1. This led to the identification of a seven-gene operon, arn<sub>EC1</sub> , that encodes enzyme homologues associated with lipopolysaccharide modification. Deletion of the arn<sub>EC1</sub> genes in strain EC1 compromised its zeamine resistance 8- to 16-fold. Further deletion of the des gene in the arn<sub>EC1</sub> mutant background reduced zeamine resistance to a level similar to that of the zeamine-sensitive Escherichia coli DH5Î±. Intriguingly, the arn<sub>EC1</sub> mutants showed varied bacterial virulence on rice, potato, and Chinese cabbage. Further analyses demonstrated that ArnBCAT<sub>EC1</sub> are involved in maintenance of the bacterial nonmucoid morphotype by repressing the expression of capsular polysaccharide genes and that ArnB<sub>EC1</sub> is a bacterial virulence determinant, influencing transcriptional expression of over 650 genes and playing a key role in modulating bacterial motility and virulence. Taken together, these findings decipher a novel zeamine resistance mechanism in D. oryzae and document new roles of the Arn enzymes in modulation of bacterial physiology and virulence.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Apramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic isolated from <i>Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius</i> and <i>S. hindustanus</i> that has found clinical use in veterinary medicine. The apramycin structure is notable for its atypical eight-carbon bicyclic dialdose (octose) moiety. While the apramycin biosynthetic gene cluster (<i>apr</i>) has been identified and several of the encoded genes functionally characterized, how the octose core itself is assembled has remained elusive. Nevertheless, recent gene deletion studies have hinted at an <i>N</i>-acetyl aminosugar being a key precursor to the octose, and this hypothesis is consistent with the additional feeding experiments described in the present report. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis indicates that AprG may be structurally similar to GlcNAc-2-epimerase and hence recognize GlcNAc or a structurally similar substrate suggesting a potential role in octose formation. AprG with an extended <i>N</i>-terminal sequence was therefore expressed, purified, and assayed in vitro demonstrating that it does indeed catalyze a transaldolation reaction between GlcNAc or GalNAc and 6'-oxo-lividamine to afford 7'-<i>N</i>-acetyldemethylaprosamine with the same 6'-<i>R</i> and 7'-<i>S</i> stereochemistry as those observed in the apramycin product. Biosynthesis of the octose core in apramycin thus proceeds in the [6 + 2] manner with GlcNAc or GalNAc as the two-carbon donor, which has not been previously reported for biological octose formation, as well as novel inverting stereochemistry of the transferred fragment. Consequently, AprG appears to be a new transaldolase that lacks any apparent sequence similarity to the currently known aldolases and catalyzes a transaldolation for which there is no established biological precedent.",

We used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify <i>S. lugdunensis</i> and collected 202 <i>S</i>. <i>lugdunensis</i> samples for further assays. Agar spot tests were performed to characterize <i>S. lugdunensis</i> lugdunin production and activity. Multilocus sequence typing, SCC<i>mec,</i> and <i>agr</i> genotyping were performed on <i>S. lugdunensis</i>. In all, 91 S<i>taphylococcus aureus</i> strains with varying vancomycin susceptibilities were used to examine lugdunin activity in <i>S. lugdunensis</i>. In total, 48 <i>S</i>. <i>lugdunensis</i> strains (23.8%) were found to be oxacillin-resistant <i>S. lugdunensis</i> (ORSL), whereas 154 (76.2%) were classified as oxacillin-sensitive <i>S. lugdunensis</i> (OSSL). Moreover, 16 (33.3%) ORSL and 35 (22.7%) OSSL strains showed antibacterial activity against <i>S. aureus</i>.

This review article highlights the recent incidents of BKA poisoning and current research discoveries on the pathogenicity of <i>B. gladioli</i> pv. <i>cocovenenans</i> and underlying biochemical mechanisms for BKA synthesis. Moreover, the characterization of <i>B. gladioli</i> pv. <i>cocovenenans</i> and the identification of the <i>bon</i> gene cluster provide a crucial foundation for developing targeted interventions to prevent BKA accumulation in food matrices.

        "pmc_abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the major infectious diseases in the world with a high incidence rate. Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a key and difficult challenge in the prevention and treatment of TB. Early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis of DR-TB is essential for selecting appropriate and personalized treatment and is an important means of reducing disease transmission and mortality. In recent years, imaging diagnosis of DR-TB has developed rapidly, but there is a lack of consistent understanding. To this end, the Infectious Disease Imaging Group, Infectious Disease Branch, Chinese Research Hospital Association; Infectious Diseases Group of Chinese Medical Association of Radiology; Digital Health Committee of China Association for the Promotion of Science and Technology Industrialization, and other organizations, formed a group of TB experts across China. The conglomerate then considered the Chinese and international diagnosis and treatment status of DR-TB, China's clinical practice, and evidence-based medicine on the methodological requirements of guidelines and standards. After repeated discussion, the expert consensus of imaging diagnosis of DR-PB was proposed. This consensus includes clinical diagnosis and classification of DR-TB, selection of etiology and imaging examination [mainly X-ray and computed tomography (CT)], imaging manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis. This expert consensus is expected to improve the understanding of the imaging changes of DR-TB, as a starting point for timely detection of suspected DR-TB patients, and can effectively improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis and achieve the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment of DR-TB.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Within biofilms, gradients of electron acceptors such as oxygen stimulate the formation of physiological subpopulations. This heterogeneity can enable cross-feeding and promote drug resilience, features of the multicellular lifestyle that make biofilm-based infections difficult to treat. The pathogenic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> produces pigments called phenazines that can support metabolic activity in hypoxic/anoxic biofilm subzones, but these compounds also include methylated derivatives that are toxic to their producer under some conditions. In this study, we uncover roles for the global regulators RpoS and Hfq/Crc in controlling the beneficial and detrimental effects of methylated phenazines in biofilms. Our results indicate that RpoS controls phenazine methylation by modulating activity of the carbon catabolite repression pathway, in which the Hfq/Crc complex inhibits translation of the phenazine methyltransferase PhzM. We find that RpoS indirectly inhibits expression of CrcZ, a small RNA that binds to and sequesters Hfq/Crc, specifically in the oxic subzone of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilms. Deletion of <i>rpoS</i> or <i>crc</i> therefore leads to overproduction of methylated phenazines, which we show leads to increased metabolic activity-an apparent beneficial effect-in hypoxic/anoxic subpopulations within biofilms. However, we also find that under specific conditions, biofilms lacking RpoS and/or Crc show increased sensitivity to phenazines indicating that the increased metabolic activity in these mutants comes at a cost. Together, these results suggest that complex regulation of PhzM allows <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to simultaneously exploit the benefits and limit the toxic effects of methylated phenazines.",

We found OMV production to correlate with the recombinant production of a natural compound with versatile beneficial properties, the tripyrrole prodigiosin. Further, several P.âputida genes were identified, whose up- or down-regulated expression allowed controlling OMV formation. Finally, genetically triggering vesiculation in production strains of the different alkaloids prodigiosin, violacein, and phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, as well as the carotenoid zeaxanthin, resulted in up to three-fold increased product yields. Consequently, our findings suggest that the construction of robust strains by genetic manipulation of OMV formation might be developed into a useful tool which may contribute to improving limited biotechnological applications.",

In bacteria, the genes that encode the biosynthesis of natural products are often colocalized in the genome, forming biosynthetic gene clusters. It has been predicted that only 3% of natural products encoded in bacterial genomes have been discovered thus far, in part because gene clusters may be poorly expressed under laboratory conditions. Heterologous expression can help convert bioinformatics predictions into products. However, challenges remain, such as gene cluster prioritization, cloning of the complete gene cluster, high level expression, product identification, and isolation of products in practical yields. Here we reviewed the literature from the past 5 years (January 2018 to June 2023) to identify studies that discovered natural products by heterologous expression. From the 50 studies identified, we present analyses of the rationale for gene cluster prioritization, cloning methods, biosynthetic class, source taxa, and host choice. Combined, the 50 studies led to the discovery of 63 new families of natural products, supporting heterologous expression as a promising way to access novel chemistry. However, the success rate of natural product detection varied from 11% to 32% based on four large-scale studies that were part of the reviewed literature. The low success rate makes it apparent that much remains to be improved. The potential reasons for failure and points to be considered to improve the chances of success are discussed.<h4>One-sentence summary</h4>At least 63 new families of bacterial natural products were discovered using heterologous expression in the last 5 years, supporting heterologous expression as a promising way to access novel chemistry; however, the success rate is low (11-32%) making it apparent that much remains to be improved-we discuss the potential reasons for failure and points to be considered to improve the chances of success.

Fungal genomes contain vast numbers of SM biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) with unknown products, suggesting that huge numbers of valuable SMs remain to be discovered. It is challenging, however, to identify SM BGCs, among the millions present in fungi, that produce useful compounds. One solution is resistance gene-guided genome mining, which takes advantage of the fact that some BGCs contain a gene encoding a resistant version of the protein targeted by the compound produced by the BGC. The bioinformatic signature of such BGCs is that they contain an allele of an essential gene with no SM biosynthetic function, and there is a second allele elsewhere in the genome. We have developed a computer-assisted approach to resistance gene-guided genome mining that allows users to query large databases for BGCs that putatively make compounds that have targets of therapeutic interest. Working with the MycoCosm genome database, we have applied this approach to look for SM BGCs that target the proteasome Î²6 subunit, the target of the proteasome inhibitor fellutamide B, or HMG-CoA reductase, the target of cholesterol reducing therapeutics such as lovastatin. Our approach proved effective, finding known fellutamide and lovastatin BGCs as well as fellutamide- and lovastatin-related BGCs with variations in the SM genes that suggest they may produce structural variants of fellutamides and lovastatin. Gratifyingly, we also found BGCs that are not closely related to lovastatin BGCs but putatively produce novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.<h4>One-sentence summary</h4>A new computer-assisted approach to resistance gene-directed genome mining is reported along with its use to identify fungal biosynthetic gene clusters that putatively produce proteasome and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",

Benzoisochromanequinone polyketides actinorhodin and naphthocyclinone are formed through dimerization of half-molecules via single or double carbon-carbon bonds, respectively. Here we sequenced the genome of S. arenae DSM40737 to identify the naphthocyclinone gene cluster and established heterologous production in S. albus J1074 by utilizing direct cluster capture techniques. Comparative sequence analysis uncovered ncnN and ncnM gene products as putative enzymes responsible for dimerization. Inactivation of ncnN that is homologous to atypical co-factor independent oxidases resulted in the accumulation of fogacin, which is likely a reduced shunt product of the true substrate for naphthocyclinone dimerization. In agreement, inactivation of the homologous actVA-3 in S. coelicolor M145 also led to significantly reduced production of actinorhodin. Previous work has identified the NAD(P)H-dependent reductase ActVA-4 as the key enzyme in actinorhodin dimerization, but surprisingly inactivation of the homologous ncnM did not abolish naphthocyclinone formation and the mutation may have been complemented by an endogenous gene product.

However, despite the clinical successes of the camptothecin derivatives, a significant need for less toxic and more chemically stable Top1 inhibitors still persists. Here, we describe one of the most frequently used protocols to identify novel Top1 inhibitors. These methods use uniquely 3'-radiolabeled DNA substrates and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to provide evidence for the Top1-mediated DNA cleaving activity of potential Top1 inhibitors. These assays allow comparison of the effectiveness of different drugs in stabilizing the Top1-DNA intermediate or cleavage (cleavable) complex. A variation on these assays is also presented, which provides a suitable system for determining whether the inhibitor blocks the forward cleavage or religation reactions by measuring the reversibility of the drug-induced Top1-DNA cleavage complexes. This entire protocol can be completed in approximately 2 d.",

The deduced product of this ORF had high degrees of similarity to Streptomyces lividans glycosyl transferase, which inactivates macrolides, and this ORF was called gimA. The cloned gimA gene was expressed in a susceptible host mutant of S. lividans devoid of any background macrolide-inactivating glycosyl transferase activity. In the presence of UDP-glucose, cell extracts from this strain could inactivate various macrolides by glycosylation. Spiramycin was not inactivated but forocidin, a spiramycin precursor, was modified. In vivo studies showed that gimA could confer low levels of resistance to some macrolides. The spectrum of this resistance differs from the one conferred by a rRNA monomethylase, such as SrmA. In S. ambofaciens, gimA was inactivated by gene replacement, without any deleterious effect on the survival of the strain, even under spiramycin-producing conditions. But the overexpression of gimA led to a marked decrease in spiramycin production. Studies with extracts from wild-type and gimA-null mutant strains revealed the existence of another macrolide-inactivating glycosyl transferase activity with a different substrate specificity. This activity might compensate for the effect of gimA inactivation.",

Subcloning experiments showed that the minimal DNA fragment required for activation was 0.4 kb in size. The activation is mediated by increasing the levels of transcription of the actII-ORF4 gene. Sequencing of the minimal activating fragment did not reveal any clues about its mechanism; nevertheless, it was shown to overlap the 3' end of two convergent genes, one of whose translated products (ORF2) strongly resembles that of other genes belonging to the ABC transporter superfamily. Computer-assisted analysis of the 3.4-kb DNA sequence showed the 3' terminus of an open reading frame (ORF), i.e., ORFA, and three complete ORFs (ORF1, ORF2, and ORFB). Searches in the databases with their respective gene products revealed similarities for ORF1 and ORF2 with ATP-binding proteins and transmembrane proteins, respectively, which are found in members of the ABC transporter superfamily. No similarities for ORFA and ORFB were found in the databases. Insertional inactivation of ORF1 and ORF2, their transcription analysis, and their cloning in heterologous hosts suggested that these genes were not expressed under our experimental conditions; however, cloning of ORF1 and ORF2 together (but not separately) under the control of an expressing promoter induced resistance to several chemically different drugs: oleandomycin, erythromycin, spiramycin, doxorubicin, and tetracycline. Thus, this genetic system, named msr, is a new bacterial multidrug ABC transporter.",

Although their deduced products resemble those of genes thought to be involved in antibiotic production in several other bacteria, this information could not be used to identify the functions of dpsY and dnrX. Replacement of dpsY with a mutant form disrupted by insertion of the aphII neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene resulted in the accumulation of UWM5, the C-19 ethyl homolog of SEK43, a known shunt product of iterative polyketide synthases involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides. Hence, DpsY must act along with the other components of the DNR-DXR polyketide synthase to form 12-deoxyaklanonic acid, the earliest known intermediate of the DXR pathway. Mutation of dnrX in the same way resulted in a threefold increase in DXR production and the disappearance of two acid-sensitive, unknown compounds from culture extracts. These results suggest that dnrX, analogous to the role of the S. peucetius dnrH gene (C. Scotti and C. R. Hutchinson, J. Bacteriol. 178:73167321, 1996), may be involved in the metabolism of DNR and/or DXR to acid-sensitive compounds, possibly related to the baumycins found in many DNR-producing bacteria.",

To decipher the basis of corallorazine biosynthesis, the corallorazine nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) biosynthetic gene cluster <i>crz</i> was identified and analyzed in detail. Here, we present a model of corallorazine biosynthesis, supported by bioinformatic analyses and <i>in vitro</i> investigations on the bimodular NRPS synthesizing the corallorazine core. Corallorazine biosynthesis shows several distinct features, such as the presence of a dehydrating condensation domain, and a unique split adenylation domain on two open reading frames. Using an alternative fatty acyl starter unit, the first steps of corallorazine biosynthesis were characterized <i>in vitro</i>, supporting our biosynthetic model. The dehydrating condensation domain was bioinformatically analyzed in detail and compared to other modifying C domains, revealing unreported specific sequence motives for this domain subfamily. Using global bioinformatics analyses, we show that the <i>crz</i> gene cluster family is widespread among bacteria and encodes notable chemical diversity. Corallorazine A displays moderate antimicrobial activity against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mode of action studies comprising whole cell analysis and <i>in vitro</i> test systems revealed that corallorazine A inhibits bacterial transcription by targeting the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",

In our previous study, we highlighted the antiphage properties of aminoglycoside antibiotics, which are naturally secreted by <i>Streptomyces</i>. Successful inhibition of phage infection was achieved by addition of pure compounds and supernatants from a natural producer strain emphasizing the potential for community-wide antiphage defense. However, given the dual functionality of these compounds, neighboring bacterial cells require resistance to the antibacterial activity of aminoglycosides to benefit from the protection they confer against phages. In this study, we tested a variety of different aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms acting via drug or target (16S rRNA) modification and demonstrated that they do not interfere with the antiphage properties of the molecules. Furthermore, we confirmed the antiphage impact of aminoglycosides in a community context by coculturing phage-susceptible, apramycin-resistant <i>Streptomyces venezuelae</i> with the apramycin-producing strain <i>Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius</i>.

Their phenotypic characteristics, such as spore formation; resistance to different factors, including drugs or disinfectants; or production of off-flavor compounds, can affect the taste and aroma of spoiled products. Food and beverages are potential vectors for the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes, which is a growing health concern; thus, microorganisms in food and beverages should not be a potential source of drug resistance to consumers. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was utilized to identify antibiotic resistance genes, metabolic pathways, and elements associated with guaiacol and halophenol production. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing revealed that all strains were susceptible to eight out of nine tested antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and vancomycin) but exhibited high resistance to erythromycin. Analysis indicated that the erythromycin resistance gene, ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase A (<i>RsmA</i>), was intrinsic and likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The comprehensive genomic analysis provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in <i>Alicyclobacillus</i> spp., highlighting the potential risk of these bacteria as vectors for antibiotic resistance genes in the food chain.

        "pmc_abstract": "Cellulolytic microorganisms secrete cellulase, which plays a crucial role in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into value-added products with diverse applications in industries, such as biofuel, healthcare, and agriculture. As the world transitions to a bioenergy future, cellulase demand is likely to expand. However, the high cost and low catalytic activity of cellulase hinder the commercialization of biorefineries. Searching for cellulase-producing microorganisms in different environments through bioprospecting can aid in broadening the range of cellulases that are currently available. Meanwhile, the cellulolytic activity of marine microorganisms remains largely unexplored, making it difficult to compare the cellulolytic activity of terrestrial and marine environments. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the diversity and activity of culturable cellulolytic microorganisms in four terrestrial and three marine sites within Panay Island, Philippines. The results showed that the cellulolytic microbial load was tenfold higher in the terrestrial sites than in the marine sites, possibly due to the dynamic mangrove environment. Out of the 42 isolates with a high cellulolytic index (CI) of â¥3.0, 36 were from terrestrial and 6 from marine habitats. The CMCase, Avicelase, and FPase activities were then tested on the 18 isolates with the highest CI. It was observed that many isolates had a high CI, but few exhibited high enzyme activities. Marine isolates showed higher CMCase and Avicelase activities, with comparable FPase activity to their terrestrial counterparts. Isolates S1ACP6B from a sugarcane field and MS1OMP2A from a mangrove site exhibited the highest cellulase activities at 0.41 and 0.29âU/mg, respectively, and were identified as <i>Enterobacter roggenkampii</i> and <i>Rhodococcus erythropolis</i>, respectively. Among the 18 identified isolates, three are resistant to chloramphenicol and three isolates are potentially new species of <i>Halomonas</i> sp. MS1ACP1B, <i>Albirhodobacter</i> sp. MP2ACP3B, and <i>Saccharomycetaceae</i> sp. B1CZP10A. Overall, this study provides an insight on the composition of cellulolytic microbial load and their activities among various habitats.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Indolizidines have long been recognized for their valuable bioactivities, their common feature being a bicyclic structure connected via a nitrogen atom. Traditionally, plants have been identified as the primary producers. However, recent discoveries have revealed that certain bacterial strains belonging to the genus of actinomycetes also possess the ability to synthesize various indolizidine-based compounds. Among these strains, <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. HNA39, <i>Saccharopolyspora</i> sp. RL78, and <i>Streptomyces</i> NCIB 11649 have been identified as producers of cyclizidines, characterized by their distinctive cyclopropyl moiety. Additionally, <i>Streptomyces griseus</i> OS-3601 synthesizes a unique class of indolizidine derivatives known as iminimycins, distinguished by their rare imine-cation structure. Protoplast fusion of a <i>Streptomyces griseus</i> strain with <i>Streptomyces tenjimariensis</i> resulted in a new indolizidine named indolizomycin. This review aims to provide an overview of known bacterial indolizidine producers, summarize current knowledge regarding the biosynthesis of cyclizidines and iminimycins, and assess their respective bioactivities.",

However, dynamic information is often hidden in the spatial structure of proteins. It is important but difficult to identify the specific residues that play a decisive role in protein dynamics. Here, we report that a critical glycine residue (Gly463) dominates the motion of threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) and the sensitivity of the enzyme to antibiotics. Obafluorin (OB), a natural antibiotic, is a novel covalent inhibitor of ThrRS. The binding of OB induces a large conformational change in ThrRS. Through five crystal structures, biochemical and biophysical analyses, and computational simulations, we found that Gly463 plays an important role in the dynamics of ThrRS. Mutating this flexible residue into more rigid residues did not damage the enzyme's three-dimensional structure but significantly improved the thermal stability of the enzyme and suppressed its ability to change conformation. These mutations cause resistance of ThrRS to antibiotics that are conformationally selective, such as OB and borrelidin. This work not only elucidates the molecular mechanism of the self-resistance of OB-producing Pseudomonas fluorescens but also emphasizes the importance of backbone kinetics for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-targeting drug development.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>New Delhi Metallo-<i>Î²</i>-lactamase producing <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (NDM-1-KP) sequence type (ST) 147 poses a significant threat in clinical settings due to its evolution into two distinct directions: hypervirulence and carbapenem resistance. Hypervirulence results from a range of virulence factors, while carbapenem resistance stems from complex biological mechanisms. The NDM-1-KP ST147 clone has emerged as a recent addition to the family of successful clones within the species.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we successfully synthesized 5-bromo-<i>N</i>-alkylthiophene-2-sulfonamides (<b>3a-c</b>) by reacting 5-bromothiophene-2-sulfonamide (<b>1</b>) with various alkyl bromides (<b>2</b>) using LiH. We also synthesized a series of compounds (<b>4a-g</b>) from compound (<b>3b</b>) using the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction with fair to good yields (56-72%). Further, we screened the synthesized molecules against clinically isolated New Delhi Metallo-<i>Î²</i>-lactamase producing <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> ST147. Subsequently, we conducted in-silico tests on compound <b>3b</b> against a protein extracted from NDM-KP ST147 with PDB ID: 5N5I.<h4>Results</h4>The compound (<b>3b</b>) with favourable drug candidate status, MIC of 0.39 Î¼g/mL, and MBC of 0.78 Î¼g/mL. This low molecular weight compound exhibited the highest potency against the resistant bacterial strains. The in-silico tests revealed that the compound <b>3b</b> against a protein extracted from NDM-KP ST147 with PDB ID: 5N5I demonstrated H-bond and hydrophobic interactions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The 5-bromo-<i>N</i>-alkylthiophene-2-sulfonamides displayed antibacterial efficacy against New Delhi Metallo-<i>Î²</i>-lactamase producing <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> ST147. After the in-vivo trial, this substance might offer an alternative therapeutic option.",

However, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a molecular subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis, lacks classical and general therapeutic targets, hindering the clinical application of several therapies to breast cancer. As insights into the unique immunity and molecular mechanisms of TNBC have become more extensive, immunotherapy has gradually become a valuable complementary approach to classical radiotherapy and chemotherapy. CD8+ cells are significant actors in the tumor immunity cycle; thus, research on TNBC immunotherapy is increasingly focused in this direction. Recently, CD8+ tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, a subpopulation of CD8+ cells, have been explored in relation to breast cancer and found to seemingly play an undeniably important role in tumor surveillance and lymphocytic infiltration. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the mechanisms and relative targets of CD8+ T cells, and discuss the features and potential applications of CD8+ TRM cells in non-luminal breast cancer immunotherapy.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background and purpose</h4>PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have become a promising therapy. However, the response rate is lower than 30% in patients with cervical cancer (CC), which is related to immunosuppressive components in tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), as one of the most important immune cells, are involved in the formation of tumor suppressive microenvironment. Therefore, it will provide a theoretical basis for curative effect improvement about the regulatory mechanism of TAMs on PD-L1 expression.<h4>Methods</h4>The clinical data and pathological tissues of CC patients were collected, and the expressions of PD-L1, CD68 and CD163 were detected by immunohistochemistry. Bioinformatics was used to analyze the macrophage subtypes involved in PD-L1 regulation. A co-culture model was established to observe the effects of TAMs on the morphology, migration and invasion function of CC cells, and the regulatory mechanism of TAMs on PD-L1.<h4>Results</h4>PD-L1 expression on tumor cells could predict the poor prognosis of patients. And there was a strong correlation between PD-L1 expression with CD163<sup>+</sup>TAMs infiltration. Similarly, PD-L1 expression was associated with M1/M2-type TAMs infiltration in bioinformatics analysis. The results of cell co-culture showed that M1/M2-type TAMs could upregulate PD-L1 expression, especially M2-type TAMs may elevate the PD-L1 expression via PI3K/AKT pathway. Meanwhile, M1/M2-type TAMs can affect the morphological changes, and enhance migration and invasion abilities of CC cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PD-L1 expression in tumor cells can be used as a prognostic factor and is closely related to CD163<sup>+</sup>TAMs infiltration. In addition, M2-type TAMs can upregulate PD-L1 expression in CC cells through PI3K/AKT pathway, enhance the migration and invasion capabilities, and affect the tumor progression.",

The second wave of antibacterial drug discovery was driven by rapid discovery of natural products, now making up 69% of current antibacterial drugs. But now with the most prevalent natural products already discovered, â¼107 new soil-dwelling bacterial species must be screened to discover one new class of natural product. Therefore, instead of a third wave of antibacterial drug discovery, there is now a discovery bottleneck. Unlike natural products which are curated by billions of years of microbial antagonism, the vast synthetic chemical space still requires artificial curation through the therapeutics science of antibacterial drugs - a systematic understanding of how small molecules interact with bacterial physiology, effect desired phenotypes, and benefit the host. Bacterial molecular genetics can elucidate pathogen biology relevant to therapeutics development, but it can also be applied directly to understanding mechanisms and liabilities of new chemical agents with new mechanisms of action. Therefore, the next phase of antibacterial drug discovery could be enabled by integrating chemical expertise with systematic dissection of bacterial infection biology. Facing the ambitious endeavour to find new molecules from nature or new-to-nature which cure bacterial infections, the capabilities furnished by modern chemical biology and molecular genetics can be applied to prospecting for chemical modulators of new targets which circumvent prevalent resistance mechanisms.",

We document the central and structured location of core genes and distal location of specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and duplicate core genes on the linear Streptomyces chromosome, and analyze the content and length of the terminal inverted repeats which are characteristic for Streptomyces. We then analyze the diversity of trans-AT polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene clusters, which encodes the machinery of a biotechnologically highly interesting compound class.

        "pmc_abstract": "The marine Streptomyces harbor numerous biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) with exploitable potential. However, many secondary metabolites cannot be produced under laboratory conditions. Co-culture strategies of marine microorganisms have yielded novel natural products with diverse biological activities. In this study, we explored the metabolic profiles of co-cultures involving <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. 2-85 and <i>Cladosporium</i> sp. 3-22-derived from marine sponges. Combining Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking analysis with natural product database mining, 35 potential antimicrobial metabolites annotated were detected, 19 of which were exclusive to the co-culture, with a significant increase in production. Notably, the Streptomyces-Fungus interaction led to the increased production of borrelidin and the discovery of several analogs via molecular networking. In this study, borrelidin was first applied to combat <i>Saprolegnia parasitica</i>, which caused saprolegniosis in aquaculture. We noted its superior inhibitory effects on mycelial growth with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.004 mg/mL and on spore germination with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.005 mg/mL compared to the commercial fungicide, preliminarily identifying threonyl-tRNA synthetase as its target. Further analysis of the associated gene clusters revealed an incomplete synthesis pathway with missing malonyl-CoA units for condensation within this strain, hinting at the presence of potential compensatory pathways. In conclusion, our findings shed light on the metabolic changes of marine Streptomyces and fungi in co-culture, propose the potential of borrelidin in the control of aquatic diseases, and present new prospects for antifungal applications.",

        "pmc_abstract": "DNA fragmentation index (DFI), a new biomarker to diagnose male infertility, is closely associated with poor reproductive outcomes. Previous research reported that seminal microbiome correlated with sperm DNA integrity, suggesting that the microbiome may be one of the causes of DNA damage in sperm. However, it has not been elucidated how the microbiota exerts their effects. Here, we used a combination of 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics techniques to investigate the role of microbiota in high sperm DNA fragmentation index (HDFI). We report that increased specific microbial profiles contribute to high sperm DNA fragmentation, thus implicating the seminal microbiome as a new therapeutic target for HDFI patients. Additionally, we found that the amount of <i>Lactobacillus</i> species was altered: <i>Lactobacillus iners</i> was enriched in HDFI patients, shedding light on the potential influence of <i>L. iners</i> on male reproductive health. Finally, we also identified enrichment of the acetyl-CoA fermentation to butanoate II and purine nucleobase degradation I in the high sperm DNA fragmentation samples, suggesting that butanoate may be the target metabolite of sperm DNA damage. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between microbiota and sperm quality in HDFI patients, laying the foundation for further research and potential clinical interventions.IMPORTANCEThe DNA fragmentation index (DFI) is a measure of sperm DNA fragmentation. Because high sperm DNA fragmentation index (HDFI) has been strongly associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, this has been linked to the seminal microbiome. Because the number of current treatments for HDFI is limited and most of them have no clear efficacy, it is critical to understand how semen microbiome exerts their effects on sperm DNA. Here, we evaluated the semen microbiome and its metabolites in patients with high and low sperm DNA fragmentation. We found that increased specific microbial profiles contribute to high sperm DNA fragmentation. In particular, <i>Lactobacillus iners</i> was uniquely correlated with high sperm DNA fragmentation. Additionally, butanoate may be the target metabolite produced by the microbiome to damage sperm DNA. Our findings support the interaction between semen microbiome and sperm DNA damage and suggest that seminal microbiome should be a new therapeutic target for HDFI patients.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Plant pathogenic fungi cause serious diseases, which result in the loss of crop yields and reduce the quality of crops worldwide. To counteract the escalating risks of chemical fungicides, interest in biological control agents to manage plant diseases has significantly increased. In this study, we comprehensively screened microbial culture filtrates using a yeast screening system to find microbes exhibiting respiratory inhibition activity. Consequently, we found a soil-borne microbe <i>Brevibacillus brevis</i> HK544 strain exhibiting a respiration inhibitory activity and identified edeine B<sub>1</sub> (EB<sub>1</sub>) from the culture filtrate of HK544 as the active compound of the respiration inhibition activity. Furthermore, against a plant pathogenic fungus <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, our results showed that EB<sub>1</sub> has effects on multiple aspects of respiration with the downregulation of most of the mitochondrial-related genes based on transcriptome analysis, differential EB<sub>1</sub>-sensitivity from targeted mutagenesis, and the synergistic effects of EB<sub>1</sub> with electron transport chain complex inhibitors. With the promising plant disease control efficacy of <i>B. brevis</i> HK544 producing EB<sub>1</sub>, our results suggest that <i>B. brevis</i> HK544 has potential as a biocontrol agent for Fusarium head blight.IMPORTANCEAs a necrotrophic fungus, <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> is a highly destructive pathogen causing severe diseases in cereal crops and mycotoxin contamination in grains. Although chemical control is considered the primary approach to control plant disease caused by <i>F. graminearum</i>, fungicide-resistant strains have been detected in the field after long-term continuous application of fungicides. Moreover, applying chemical fungicides that trigger mycotoxin biosynthesis is a great concern for many researchers. Biocontrol of <i>Fusarium</i> head blight (FHB) by biological control agents (BCAs) represents an alternative approach and could be used as part of the integrated management of FHB and mycotoxin production. The most extensive studies on bacterial BCAs-fungal communications in agroecosystems have focused on antibiosis. Although many BCAs in agricultural ecology have already been used for fungal disease control, the molecular mechanisms of antibiotics produced by BCAs remain to be elucidated. Here, we found a potential BCA (<i>Brevibacillus brevis</i> HK544) with a strong antifungal activity based on the respiration inhibition activity with its active compound edeine B<sub>1</sub> (EB<sub>1</sub>). Furthermore, our results showed that EB<sub>1</sub> secreted by HK544 suppresses the expression of the mitochondria-related genes of <i>F. graminearum</i>, subsequently suppressing fungal development and the virulence of <i>F. graminearum</i>. In addition, EB<sub>1</sub> exhibited a synergism with complex I inhibitors such as rotenone and fenazaquin. Our work extends our understanding of how <i>B. brevis</i> HK544 exhibits antifungal activity and suggests that the <i>B. brevis</i> HK544 strain could be a valuable source for developing new crop protectants to control <i>F. graminearum</i>.",

To date, a large number of research articles exist in the literature describing the case reports associated with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial strains. However, these findings are scattered, making it time-consuming for researchers to locate promising results and there remains a need for a comparative study to compile these case reports from various geographical regions including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, no study has yet been published that compares the genetic variations and case reports of MDR and XDR strains identified from Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, Central Europe, and Asian countries. This study attempts to provide a comparative analysis of several MDR and XDR case reports from Saudi Arabia alongside other countries. Furthermore, the purpose of this work is to demonstrate the genetic variations in the genes underlying the resistance mechanisms seen in MDR and XDR bacterial strains that have been reported in Saudi Arabia and other countries. To cover the gap, this comprehensive review explores the complex trends in antibiotic resistance and the growing risk posed by superbugs. We provide context on the concerning spread of drug-resistant bacteria by analyzing the fundamental mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and looking into individual case reports. In this article, we compiled various cases and stories associated with XDR and MDR strains from Saudi Arabia and various other countries including China, Egypt, India, Poland, Pakistan, and Taiwan. This review will serve as basis for highlighting the growing threat of MDR, XDR bacterial strains in Saudi Arabia, and poses the urgent need for national action plans, stewardship programs, preventive measures, and novel antibiotics research in the Kingdom.",

In this study, metabolomics analysis was performed on two groups of rice (T1, with insect pests; T2, without pests), indicating that fatty acids, alkaloids, and phenolic acids were significantly up-regulated in T1. The up-regulated metabolites (<i>p</i>-value < 0.1) were enriched in linoleic acid metabolism, terpene, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, Î±-linolenic acid metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. Six significantly up-regulated differential metabolites in T1 were screened out: <i>N</i>-<i>trans</i>-feruloyl-3-methoxytyramine (<b>1</b>), <i>N</i>-<i>trans</i>-feruloyltyramine (<b>2</b>), N-<i>trans</i>-<i>p</i>-coumaroyltyramine (<b>3</b>), <i>N</i>-<i>cis</i>-feruloyltyramine (<b>4</b>), <i>N</i>-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine (<b>5</b>), and benzamide (<b>6</b>). The insect growth inhibitory activities of these six different metabolites were determined, and the results show that compound <b>1</b> had the highest activity, which significantly inhibited the growth of <i>Chilo suppressalis</i> by 59.63%. Compounds <b>2</b>-<b>4</b> also showed a good inhibitory effect on the growth of <i>Chilo suppressalis</i>, while the other compounds had no significant effect. RNA-seq analyses showed that larval exposure to compound <b>1</b> up-regulated the genes that were significantly enriched in ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, the cell cycle, ribosomes, and other pathways. The down-regulated genes were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and other pathways. Eighteen up-regulated genes and fifteen down-regulated genes from the above significantly enriched pathways were screened out and verified by real-time quantitative PCR. The activities of detoxification enzymes (glutathione S-transferase (GST); UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT); and carboxylesterase (CarE)) under larval exposure to compound <b>1</b> were measured, which indicated that the activity of GST was significantly inhibited by compound <b>1</b>, while the activities of the UGT and CarE enzymes did not significantly change. As determined by UPLC-MS, the contents of compound <b>1</b> in the T1 and T2 groups were 8.55 ng/g and 0.53 ng/g, respectively, which indicated that pest insects significantly induced the synthesis of compound <b>1</b>. Compound <b>1</b> may enhance rice insect resistance by inhibiting the detoxification enzyme activity and metabolism of <i>Chilo suppressalis</i>, as well as promoting cell proliferation to affect its normal growth and development process. The chemical-ecological mechanism of the insect resistance of rice is preliminarily clarified in this paper.",

Fumonisins are presumed virulence factors of plant pathogens, but may also play a role in interactions between competing fungi.

We reinvestigated the role of <i>FUM17</i> and <i>FUM18</i> by generating a double mutant strain in a <i>fum1</i> background. Nearly unchanged resistance to added FB<sub>1</sub> was observed compared to the parental <i>fum1</i> strain. A recently developed fumonisin-sensitive baker's yeast strain allowed for the testing of candidate ceramide synthases by heterologous expression. The overexpression of the yeast <i>LAC1</i> gene, but not <i>LAG1</i>, increased fumonisin resistance. High-level resistance was conferred by <i>FUM18</i>, but not by <i>FUM17</i>. Likewise, strong resistance to FB<sub>1</sub> was caused by overexpression of the presumed <i>F. verticillioides</i> \"housekeeping\" ceramide synthases <i>CER1</i>, <i>CER2</i>, and <i>CER3</i>, located outside the fumonisin cluster, indicating that <i>F. verticillioides</i> possesses a redundant set of insensitive targets as a self-resistance mechanism.",

However, a major challenge in the field of genome mining is determining how to selectively extract biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for untapped natural products from numerous available genome sequences. In this study, we developed a fungal genome mining tool that extracts BGCs encoding enzymes that lack a detectable protein domain (i.e., domainless enzymes) and are not recognized as biosynthetic proteins by existing bioinformatic tools. We searched for BGCs encoding a homologue of Pyr4-family terpene cyclases, which are representative examples of apparently domainless enzymes, in approximately 2000 fungal genomes and discovered several BGCs with unique features. The subsequent characterization of selected BGCs led to the discovery of fungal onoceroid triterpenoids and unprecedented onoceroid synthases. Furthermore, in addition to the onoceroids, a previously unreported sesquiterpene hydroquinone, of which the biosynthesis involves a Pyr4-family terpene cyclase, was obtained. Our genome mining tool has broad applicability in fungal genome mining and can serve as a beneficial platform for accessing diverse, unexploited natural products.",

In this study, the genome size, DNA ploidy level, and A-T/G-C ratio were measured for the first time for two genotypes of chia, Salvia hispanica, an herbaceous plant commonly used in phytotherapy and nutrition. This study also evaluated, for the first time by flow cytometry, the capacity to produce organic acids of tissues stained with LysoTracker Deep Red after elicitation with either yeast extract or cadmium chloride. Rosmarinic acid content differed between the two chia varieties treated with different elicitor concentrations, compared with non-elicited plant material. Elicited tissues of both varieties contained a higher content of rosmarinic acid compared with non-elicited cultures, and cadmium chloride at 500 Î¼M was much better than that at 1000 Î¼M, which led to plant death. For both genotypes, a dose-response was observed with yeast extract, as the higher the concentration of elicitor used, the higher rosmarinic acid content, resulting also in better results and a higher content of rosmarinic acid compared with cadmium chloride. This study demonstrates that flow cytometry may be used as a taxonomy tool, to distinguish among very close genotypses of a given species and, for the first time in plants, that this approach can also be put to profit for a characterization of the cytoplasmic acid phase and the concomitant production of secondary metabolites of interest in vitro, with or without elicitation.

It possesses antibacterial and antiviral activities and can reduce interfacial tension. <i>Bacillus</i> are commonly used as production chassis, but wild-type <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> 168 cannot synthesise surfactin. In this study, the phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) gene <i>sfp</i>* (with a T base removed) was overexpressed and enzyme activity was restored, enabling <i>B. subtilis</i> 168 to synthesise surfactin with a yield of 747.5 Â± 6.5 mg/L. Knocking out <i>ppsD</i> and <i>yvkC</i> did not enhance surfactin synthesis.

By replacing the native promoter of the <i>srfA</i> operon encoding surfactin synthase with three promoters, surfactin synthesis was significantly reduced. However, knockout of the global transcriptional regulator gene <i>codY</i> enhanced the surfactin titre to 1601.8 Â± 91.9 mg/L. The highest surfactin titre reached 3.89 Â± 0.07 g/L, with the yield of 0.63 Â± 0.02 g/g DCW, after 36 h of fed-batch fermentation in 5 L fermenter.

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Anthraquinone-fused enediynes (AFEs) are excellent payloads for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The yields of AFEs in the original bacterial hosts are extremely low. Multiple traditional methods had been adopted to enhance the production of the AFEs. Despite these efforts, the production titers of these compounds are still low, presenting a practical challenge for their development. Tiancimycins (TNMs) are a class of AFEs produced by Streptomyces sp. CB03234. One of their salient features is that they exhibit rapid and complete cell killing ability against various cancer cell lines.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy guided by the CB03234-S genome and transcriptome was employed to improve the titers of TNMs. First, re-sequencing of CB03234-S (Ribosome engineered mutant strains) genome revealed the deletion of a 583-kb DNA fragment, accounting for about 7.5% of its genome. Second, by individual or combined inactivation of seven potential precursor competitive biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in CB03234-S, a double-BGC inactivation mutant, S1009, was identified with an improved TNMs titer of 28.2âÂ±â0.8Â mg/L. Third, overexpression of five essential biosynthetic genes, including two post-modification genes, and three self-resistance auxiliary genes, was also conducted, through which we discovered that mutants carrying the core genes, tnmE or tnmE10, exhibited enhanced TNMs production. The average TNMs yield reached 43.5âÂ±â2.4Â mg/L in a 30-L fermenter, representing an approximately 360% increase over CB03234-S and the highest titer among all AFEs to date. Moreover, the resulting mutant produced TNM-W, a unique TNM derivative with a double bond instead of a common ethylene oxide moiety. Preliminary studies suggested that TNM-W was probably converted from TNM-A by both TnmE and TnmE10.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Based on the genome and transcriptome analyses, we adopted a combined metabolic engineering strategy for precursor enrichment and biosynthetic pathway reorganization to construct a high-yield strain of TNMs based on CB03234-S. Our study establishes a solid basis for the clinical development of AFE-based ADCs.",

        "pmc_abstract": "With <i>Bacillus</i> species, about 30% of extracellular proteins are translocated through the cytoplasmic membrane, coordinated by the Sec translocase. This system mainly consists of the cytoplasmic ATPase SecA and the membrane-embedded SecYEG channel. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effects of the SecYEG export system on the production of industrial biomolecules, such as biosurfactants, proteases, amylases, and cellulases. Fifty-two isolates of <i>Bacillus</i> species were obtained from traditional fermented foods and then characterized using molecular microbiology methods. The isolates secreted exoenzymes that included cellulases, amylases, and proteases. We present evidence that a biosurfactant-like molecule requires the SecA ATPase and the SecYEG membrane channel for its secretion. In addition, we showed that biomolecules involved in biofilm formation required the SecYEG pathway. This work presents a novel seven-target fragment multiplex PCR assay capable of identification at the species level of <i>Bacillus</i> through a unique SecDF chromosomal gene. The bacterial membrane protein SecDF allowed the discrimination of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>B. licheniformis</i>, <i>B. amyloliquefaciens,</i> and <i>B. sonorensis</i>. SecA was able to interact with AprE, AmyE, and TasA. The Rose Bengal inhibitor of SecA crucially affected the interaction of AprE, AmyE, TapA, and TasA with recombinant Gst-SecA. The Rose Bengal prevented <i>Bacillus</i> species from secreting and producing proteases, cellulases, amylases, and biosurfactant-like molecules. It also inhibited the formation of biofilm cell communities. The data support, for the first time, that the SecYEG translocon mediates the secretion of a biosurfactant-like molecule.",

Since their discovery about a century ago, there has been a growing interest in bacteriocin research and applications. This is mainly due to their high antimicrobial properties, narrow or broad spectrum of activity, specificity, low cytotoxicity, and stability. Though initially used to improve food quality and safety, bacteriocins are now globally exploited for innovative applications in human, animal, and food systems as sustainable alternatives to antibiotics. Bacteriocins have the potential to beneficially modulate microbiota, providing viable microbiome-based solutions for the treatment, management, and non-invasive bio-diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious diseases. The use of bacteriocins holds great promise in the modulation of food microbiomes, antimicrobial food packaging, bio-sanitizers and antibiofilm, pre/post-harvest biocontrol, functional food, growth promotion, and sustainable aquaculture. This can undoubtedly improve food security, safety, and quality globally. This review highlights the current trends in bacteriocin research, especially the increasing research outputs and funding, which we believe may proportionate the soaring global interest in bacteriocins. The use of cutting-edge technologies, such as bioengineering, can further enhance the exploitation of bacteriocins for innovative applications in human, animal, and food systems.",

While synteny (conservation of gene order) has previously been used independently and in combination with other methods to identify orthologs, applying synteny in ortholog identification has yet to be automated in a user-friendly manner. This desire for automation and ease-of-use led us to develop OrthoRefine, a standalone program that uses synteny to refine ortholog identification.<h4>Results</h4>We developed OrthoRefine to improve the detection of orthologous genes by implementing a look-around window approach to detect synteny. We tested OrthoRefine in tandem with OrthoFinder, one of the most used software for identification of orthologs in recent years. We evaluated improvements provided by OrthoRefine in several bacterial and a eukaryotic dataset. OrthoRefine efficiently eliminates paralogs from orthologous groups detected by OrthoFinder. Using synteny increased specificity and functional ortholog identification; additionally, analysis of BLAST e-value, phylogenetics, and operon occurrence further supported using synteny for ortholog identification. A comparison of several window sizes suggested that smaller window sizes (eight genes) were generally the most suitable for identifying orthologs via synteny. However, larger windows (30 genes) performed better in datasets containing less closely related genomes. A typical run of OrthoRefine withâ~â10 bacterial genomes can be completed in a few minutes on a regular desktop PC.<h4>Conclusion</h4>OrthoRefine is a simple-to-use, standalone tool that automates the application of synteny to improve ortholog detection. OrthoRefine is particularly efficient in eliminating paralogs from orthologous groups delineated by standard methods.",

The doxorubicin fermentation yield of the wild-type strain was very low, so it could not be produced directly by fermentation at an industrial scale due to the high cost. In the present study, S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 was obtained from SIPI-14 through several rounds of doxorubicin resistance screening. Then, the ketoreductase gene dnrU was knocked out to reduce (13S)-13-dihydrodaunorubicin production, and the resistance gene drrC was overexpressed to further enhance resistance to doxorubicin. The resulting engineered strain S. peucetius â³U1/drrC produced 1128Â mg/L doxorubicin, a 102.1% increase compared to that of SIPI-14.

To simplify the composition of fermentation products from industrial strain, the main byproduct apramycin was blocked by gene disruption and constructed a mutant mainly producing carbamoyltobramycin. The generation of antibiotics is significantly affected by the secondary metabolism of actinomycetes which could be controlled by modifying the pathway-specific regulatory proteins within the cluster. Within the tobramycin biosynthesis cluster, a transcriptional regulatory factor TobR belonging to the Lrp/AsnC family was identified. Based on the sequence and structural characteristics, tobR might encode a pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory factor during biosynthesis. Knockout and overexpression strains of tobR were constructed to investigate its role in carbamoyltobramycin production. Results showed that knockout of TobR increased carbamoyltobramycin biosynthesis by 22.35%, whereas its overexpression decreased carbamoyltobramycin production by 10.23%. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments confirmed that TobR interacts with DNA at the adjacent tobO promoter position. Strains overexpressing tobO with ermEp* promoter exhibited 36.36% increase, and tobO with kasOp* promoter exhibited 22.84% increase in carbamoyltobramycin titer. When the overexpressing of tobO and the knockout of tobR were combined, the production of carbamoyltobramycin was further enhanced. In the shake-flask fermentation, the titer reached 3.76Â g/L, which was 42.42% higher than that of starting strain. Understanding the role of Lrp/AsnC family transcription regulators would be useful for other antibiotic biosynthesis in other actinomycetes.

        "pmc_abstract": "Surfactin is a cyclic hexalipopeptide compound, nonribosomal synthesized by representatives of the Bacillus subtilis species complex which includes B. subtilis group and its closely related species, such as B. subtilis subsp subtilis, B. subtilis subsp spizizenii, B. subtilis subsp inaquosorum, B. atrophaeus, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. velezensis (Steinke mSystems 6: e00057, 2021) It functions as a biosurfactant and signaling molecule and has antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, and plant disease resistance properties. The Bacillus lipopeptides play an important role in agriculture, oil recovery, cosmetics, food processing and pharmaceuticals, but the natural yield of surfactin synthesized by Bacillus is low. This paper reviews the regulatory pathways and mechanisms that affect surfactin synthesis and release, highlighting the regulatory genes involved in the transcription of the srfAA-AD operon. The several ways to enhance surfactin production, such as governing expression of the genes involved in synthesis and regulation of surfactin synthesis and transport, removal of competitive pathways, optimization of media, and fermentation conditions were commented. This review will provide a theoretical platform for the systematic genetic modification of high-yielding strains of surfactin.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Bacteria of the genus Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are motile, Gram-negative bacteria that live in symbiosis with entomopathogenic nematodes. Due to their complex life cycle, they produce a large number of specialized metabolites (natural products) encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC). Genetic tools for Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus have been rare and applicable to only a few strains. In the past, several tools have been developed for the activation of BGCs and the deletion of individual genes. However, these often have limited efficiency or are time consuming. Among the limitations, it is essential to have versatile expression systems and genome editing tools that could facilitate the practical work.<h4>Results</h4>In the present study, we developed several expression vectors and a CRISPR-Cpf1 genome editing vector for genetic manipulations in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus using SEVA plasmids. The SEVA collection is based on modular vectors that allow exchangeability of different elements (e.g. origin of replication and antibiotic selection markers with the ability to insert desired sequences for different end applications). Initially, we tested different SEVA vectors containing the broad host range origins and three different resistance genes for kanamycin, gentamycin and chloramphenicol, respectively. We demonstrated that these vectors are replicative not only in well-known representatives, e.g. Photorhabdus laumondii TTO1, but also in other rarely described strains like Xenorhabdus sp. TS4. For our CRISPR/Cpf1-based system, we used the pSEVA231 backbone to delete not only small genes but also large parts of BGCs. Furthermore, we were able to activate and refactor BGCs to obtain high production titers of high value compounds such as safracin B, a semisynthetic precursor for the anti-cancer drug ET-743.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of this study provide new inducible expression vectors and a CRISPR/CPf1 encoding vector all based on the SEVA (Standard European Vector Architecture) collection, which can improve genetic manipulation and genome editing processes in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus.",

The detection and characterization of novel resistance mechanisms are essential to better predict the spread and evolution of antibiotic resistance. Corramycin is a novel and modified peptidic antibiotic with activity against several Gram-negative pathogens. We demonstrate that the kinase ComG, part of the corramycin biosynthetic gene cluster, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates corramycin, leading to the resistance of the host. Remarkably, we found that the closest structural homologues of ComG are aminoglycoside phosphotransferases; however, ComG shows no activity toward this class of antibiotics. The crystal structure of ComG in complex with corramycin reveals that corramycin adopts a Î²-hairpin-like structure and allowed us to define the changes leading to a switch in substrate from sugar to peptide. Bioinformatic analyses suggest a limited occurrence of ComG-like proteins, which along with the absence of cross-resistance to clinically used drugs positions corramycin as an attractive antibiotic for further development.",

Thiolutin and the related dithiolopyrrolone holomycin chelate Zn2+ and previous studies have concluded that RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) inhibition in vivo is indirect. Here, we present chemicogenetic and biochemical approaches to investigate thiolutin's mode of action in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identify mutants that alter sensitivity to thiolutin. We provide genetic evidence that thiolutin causes oxidation of thioredoxins in vivo and that thiolutin both induces oxidative stress and interacts functionally with multiple metals including Mn2+ and Cu2+, and not just Zn2+. Finally, we show direct inhibition of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription initiation by thiolutin in vitro in support of classical studies that thiolutin can directly inhibit transcription in vitro. Inhibition requires both Mn2+ and appropriate reduction of thiolutin as excess DTT abrogates its effects. Pause prone, defective elongation can be observed in vitro if inhibition is bypassed. Thiolutin effects on Pol II occupancy in vivo are widespread but major effects are consistent with prior observations for Tor pathway inhibition and stress induction, suggesting that thiolutin use in vivo should be restricted to studies on its modes of action and not as an experimental tool.",

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has evolved into a pressing global health crisis, linked to elevated mortality rates in the modern medical era. Additionally, the absence of effective antibiotics introduces substantial risks to medical and surgical procedures. The dwindling interest of pharmaceutical industries in developing new antibiotics against MDR pathogens has aggravated the scarcity issue, resulting in an exceedingly limited pipeline of new antibiotics. Given these circumstances, the imperative to devise novel strategies to combat perilous MDR pathogens has become paramount. Contemporary research has unveiled several promising avenues for addressing this challenge.

In this study, we report the discovery, biosynthesis, biomimetic total synthesis, physiological function, structure-activity relationship, and self-resistance mechanism of the 5-methylated pyrazinone coralinone from a myxobacterium <i>Corallococcus exiguus</i> SDU70. A single NRPS/PKS gene <i>corA</i> was genetically and biochemically demonstrated to orchestrate coralinone, wherein the integral PKS part is responsible for installing the 5-methyl group. Intriguingly, coralinone exacerbated cellular aggregation of myxobacteria grown in liquid cultures by enhancing the secretion of extracellular matrix, and the 5-methylation is indispensable for the alleged activity. We provided an evolutionary landscape of the <i>corA</i>-associated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) distributed in the myxobacterial realm, revealing the divergent evolution for the diversity-oriented biosynthesis of 5-alkyated pyrazinones. This phylogenetic contextualization provoked us to identify <i>corB</i> located in the proximity of <i>corA</i> as a self-resistance gene. CorB was experimentally verified to be a protease that hydrolyzes extracellular proteins to antagonize the agglutination-inducing effect of coralinone. Overall, we anticipate these findings will provide new insights into the chemical ecology of myxobacteria and lay foundations for the maximal excavation of these largely underexplored resources.",

In addition to the well-studied Actinobacteria, understudied bacterial taxa like the Gram-negative myxobacteria have increasingly gained attention in the ongoing search for novel and biologically active natural products. In the course of a regional sampling campaign to source novel myxobacteria, we recently uncovered new myxobacterial strains MCy12716 and MCy12733 belonging to the <i>Myxococcaceae</i> clade. Early bioactivity screens of the bacterial extracts revealed the presence of bioactive natural products that were identified as angiolam A and several novel derivatives. Sequencing of the corresponding producer strains allowed the identification of the angiolam biosynthetic gene cluster, which was verified by targeted gene inactivation. Based on bioinformatic analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster, a concise biosynthesis model was devised to explain angiolam biosynthesis. Importantly, novel angiolam derivatives uncovered in this study named angiolams B, C, and D were found to display promising antiparasitic activities against the malaria pathogen <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in the 0.3-0.8 ÂµM range.IMPORTANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic and continuously emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have recently raised awareness about limited treatment options against infectious diseases. However, the shortage of treatment options against protozoal parasitic infections, like malaria, is much more severe, especially for the treatment of so-called neglected tropical diseases. The detection of anti-parasitic bioactivities of angiolams produced by MCy12716 and MCy12733 displays the hidden potential of scarcely studied natural products to have promising biological activities in understudied indications. Furthermore, the improved biological activities of novel angiolam derivatives against <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and the evaluation of its biosynthesis display the opportunities of the angiolam scaffold on route to treat protozoal parasitic infections as well as possible ways to increase the production of derivatives with improved bioactivities.",

Among microbes, the genus Streptomyces holds particular significance for secondary metabolite discovery. Each Streptomyces species typically encodes approximately 30 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs) within its genome, which are mostly uncharacterized in terms of their products and bioactivities. The development of next-generation sequencing has enabled the identification of a large number of potent smBGCs for novel secondary metabolites that are imbalanced in number compared with discovered secondary metabolites. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system has revolutionized the translation of enormous genomic potential into the discovery of secondary metabolites as the most efficient genetic engineering tool for Streptomyces. In this review, the current status of CRISPR/Cas applications in Streptomyces is summarized, with particular focus on the identification of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters and their potential applications.This review summarizes the broad range of CRISPR/Cas applications in Streptomyces for natural product discovery and production.<h4>One-sentence summary</h4>This review summarizes the broad range of CRISPR/Cas applications in Streptomyces for natural product discovery and production.",

Here, we report six gut-derived class I lantibiotics that are close homologues of nisin, four of which are novel. We applied an improved lantibiotic expression platform to produce and purify these lantibiotics for antimicrobial assays. We determined their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both Gram-positive human pathogens and gut commensals and profiled the lantibiotic resistance genes in these pathogens and commensals. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies with analogs revealed key regions and residues that impact their antimicrobial properties. Our characterization and SAR studies of nisin-like lantibiotics against both pathogens and human gut commensals could shed light on the future development of lantibiotic-based therapeutics and food preservatives.",

Here, we report the discovery of a naturally inspired lipopeptide antibiotic called cilagicin, which we chemically synthesized on the basis of a detailed bioinformatic analysis of the <i>cil</i> biosynthetic gene cluster. Cilagicin's ability to sequester two distinct, indispensable undecaprenyl phosphates used in cell wall biosynthesis, together with the absence of detectable resistance in laboratory tests and among multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, makes it an appealing candidate for combating antibiotic-resistant pathogens.",

In order to impart resistance, microbes use different molecular mechanisms including target protection, active efflux, and enzymatic degradation. A deeper understanding of the structure, mechanism, and regulation of the genes and proteins associated with tetracycline resistance will contribute to the development of tetracycline derivatives that overcome resistance. Newer generations of tetracyclines derived from engineering of biosynthetic genetic programs, semi-synthesis, and in particular recent developments in their chemical synthesis, together with a growing understanding of resistance, will serve to retain this class of antibiotic to combat pathogens.",

Challenging sequences include proline-rich motifs as well as highly positively and negatively charged amino acid stretches. Members of the F subfamily of ABC ATPases (ABCFs) have been long hypothesised to promote translation of such problematic motifs. In this study we have applied genetics and reporter-based assays to characterise the four housekeeping ABCF ATPases of Bacillus subtilis: YdiF, YfmM, YfmR/Uup and YkpA/YbiT. We show that YfmR cooperates with the translation factor EF-P that promotes translation of Pro-rich motifs. Simultaneous loss of both YfmR and EF-P results in a dramatic growth defect. Surprisingly, this growth defect can be largely suppressed though overexpression of an EF-P variant lacking the otherwise crucial 5-amino-pentanolylated residue K32. Using in vivo reporter assays, we show that overexpression of YfmR can alleviate ribosomal stalling on Asp-Pro motifs. Finally, we demonstrate that YkpA/YbiT promotes translation of positively and negatively charged motifs but is inactive in resolving ribosomal stalls on proline-rich stretches. Collectively, our results provide insights into the function of ABCF translation factors in modulating protein synthesis in B. subtilis.",

These oxidases have the ability to transfer a hydride atom to the FAD cofactor, which enables complex substrate modifications and rearrangements including (intramolecular) cyclizations, carbon-carbon bond formations, and nucleophilic additions. Despite the diverse range of activities, the mechanistic details of these reactions often remain incompletely understood. In this Review, we delve into the complexity that BBE-like oxidases from bacteria, fungal, and plant origins exhibit by providing an overview of the shared catalytic features and emphasizing the different reactivities. We propose four generalized modes of action by which BBE-like oxidases enable the synthesis of natural products, ranging from the classic alcohol oxidation reactions to less common amine and amide oxidation reactions. Exploring the mechanisms utilized by nature to produce its vast array of natural products is a subject of considerable interest and can lead to the discovery of unique biochemical activities.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The global rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) presents a critical challenge necessitating the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents. Mangrove microbes are valuable sources of new antimicrobial compounds. This study reports the discovery of a potent antimicrobial peptide (AMP) from <i>Bacillus paralicheniformis</i> NNS4-3, isolated from mangrove sediment, exhibiting significant activity against methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA). The AMP demonstrated a minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 1 to 16 Âµg/mL in the tested bacteria and exhibited bactericidal effects at higher concentrations. Structural analysis revealed a bacitracin-like configuration and the peptide acted by disrupting bacterial membranes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The AMP maintained stability under heat, proteolytic enzymes, surfactants, and varying pH treatments. The ten biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of secondary metabolites were found in the genome. Detailed sequence comparison of the predicted bacitracin BGC indicated distinct DNA sequences compared to previously reported strains. Although the antibiotic resistance genes were found, this strain was susceptible to antibiotics. Our findings demonstrated the potential of <i>Bacillus paralicheniformis</i> NNS4-3 and its AMP as a promising agent in combating AMR. The genetic information could be pivotal for future applications in the healthcare industry, emphasizing the need for continued exploration of marine microbial diversity in drug discovery.",

Ã <i>Vitis labrusca</i> L.: Rose Honey) seedlings inoculated with fungal endophytes <i>Epicoccum layuense</i> R2-21 (Epi R2-21) and <i>Alternaria alternata</i> XHYN2 (Alt XHYN2), were analyzed at three different time points (6 h, 6 d, and 15 d). A total of 4783 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was found, of which 1853 (6 h), 3878 (6 d), and 4732 (15 d) were differentially expressed relative to those of the control in endophyte Epi R2-21 treatments, while a total of 5898 DEGs, of which 2726 (6 h), 4610 (6 d), and 3938 (15 d) were differentially expressed in endophyte Alt XHYN2 treatments. DEGs enriched in secondary metabolic pathways, plant-pathogen interaction, and hormone signalling were further analysed. The upregulated DEGs in the Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 treatments, both enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), were mainly involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and circadian rhythms-plant and plant-pathogen interactions, similar to the trend observed in our previous study conducted on the cultivar 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.). Taken together with the results obtained from the cultivar 'Cabernet Sauvignon', it was found that tissue-cultured seedlings of the cultivar 'Rose Honey' induced a stronger defence response to fungal endophyte infection than that of the cultivar 'Cabernet Sauvignon', and inoculation with the endophyte Alt XHYN2 triggered a stronger response than inoculation with the endophyte Epi R2-21. In addition, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed that the genes <i>VIT_16s0100g00910</i>, encoding CHS, and <i>VIT_11s0065g00350</i>, encoding CYP73A, were involved in secondary metabolism and thus mediated in the resistance mechanism of grapevine on both the cultivars. The results showed that inoculation with the endophytes Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 had a great ability to induce defence responses and reprogram the gene expression profiles in different grapevine cultivars, which deepens our knowledge of the interaction between fungal endophytes and grapevine and gives hints for grape quality management in viticulture using candidate fungal endophytes.",

We found that the SCO7222 protein and ActR repress the expression of their putative target genes, SCO7223 and actII-ORF2 (actA), respectively, by interacting with operator sequence in the promoters. The operators recognized by the two proteins are related such that O(7223) (an operator for SCO7223) could be bound by both the SCO7222 protein and ActR with similar affinities. In contrast, O(act) (an operator for actII-ORF2) was bound tightly by ActR and more weakly by the SCO7222 protein. We demonstrated ligand specificity of these proteins by showing that while TetR (but not ActR or the SCO7222 protein) interacts with tetracyclines, ActR (but not TetR or the SCO7222 protein) interacts with actinorhodin and related molecules. Through operator-targeted mutagenesis, we found that at least two nucleotide changes in O(7223) were required to disrupt its interaction with SCO7222 protein, while ActR was more sensitive to changes on O(act). Most importantly, we found that the interaction of each protein with wild-type and mutant operator sequences in vivo and in vitro correlated perfectly. Our data suggest that E. coli-based biosensors of this type should be broadly applicable to TetR-like transcription factors.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>We have recently shown that cadmium can induce malignant transformation of the human prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) and that these cadmium-transformed prostate epithelial (CTPE) cells acquire apoptotic resistance concurrently with malignant phenotype.<h4>Objective</h4>The present study was designed to define the mechanism of acquired apoptotic resistance in CTPE cells.<h4>Methods</h4>Various molecular events associated with apoptosis were assessed in control and CTPE cells that were obtained after 8 weeks of continuous cadmium exposure.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with control, CTPE cells showed a generalized resistance to apoptosis induced by cadmium, cisplatin, or etoposide. Signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1 and JNK2), and p38 were phosphorylated in a cadmium concentration-dependent fashion in CTPE and control cells. However, phosphorylated JNK1/2 levels and JNK kinase activity were much lower in CTPE cells. The pro-apoptotic gene Bax showed lower transcript and protein levels, whereas the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 showed higher levels in CTPE cells. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, a key determinant in apoptotic commitment, increased more than 4-fold in CTPE cells. In Bcl-2-transfected PT-67 cells, phosphorylated JNK1/2 levels were much lower after apoptogenic stimulus, and apoptosis induced by cadmium or etoposide was reduced compared with control. Mutation of tyrosine to serine at the 21st amino acid of the Bcl-2 protein BH4 domain resulted in a loss both of suppression of JNK1/2 phosphorylation and its anti-apoptotic function.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CTPE cells become resistant to apoptosis during malignant transformation, and disruption of the JNK pathway and Bcl-2 overexpression play important roles in this resistance. Bcl-2 BH4 domain is required for modulating JNK phosphorylation and anti-apoptotic function.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Current treatment for serious infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus relies heavily upon the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. Unfortunately, this practice has led to an intermediate resistance phenotype that is particularly difficult to treat in invasive staphylococcal diseases, such as septicemia and its metastatic complications, including endocarditis. Although the vancomycin-intermediate resistance phenotype has been linked to abnormal cell wall structures and autolytic rates, the corresponding genetic changes have not been fully elucidated. Previously, whole-genome array studies listed numerous genes that are overexpressed in vancomycin-intermediate sensitive strains, including graRS (SACOL0716 to -0717), encoding a two-component regulatory system (TCRS), as well as the adjacent vraFG (SACOL0718 to -0720), encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter; but the exact contribution of these genes to increased vancomycin resistance has not been defined. In this study, we showed that isogenic strains with mutations in genes encoding the GraRS TCRS and the VraFG ABC transporter are hypersensitive to vancomycin as well as polymyxin B. Moreover, GraRS regulates the expression of the adjacent VraFG pump, reminiscent of gram-positive bacteriocin-immunity regulons. Mutations of graRS and vraFG also led to increased autolytic rates and a more negative net surface charge, which may explain, in part, to their increased sensitivity to cationic antimicrobial peptides. Taken together, these data reveal an important genetic mediator to the vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus phenotype and may hold clues to the selective pressures on staphylococci upon exposure to selective cationic peptide antibiotics used in clinical practice.",

The structure of these enzyme-ligand complexes, in tandem with kinetic analysis of site-directed variants, provide insight into the interaction of macrolides with their synthetic apparatus. Erythromycin binds to OleD and the 23S RNA of its target ribosome in the same conformation and, although the antibiotic contains a large number of polar groups, its interaction with these macromolecules is primarily through hydrophobic contacts. Erythromycin and oleandomycin, when bound to OleD and OleI, respectively, adopt different conformations, reflecting a subtle effect on sugar positioning by virtue of a single change in the macrolide backbone. The data reported here provide structural insight into the mechanism of resistance to both endogenous and exogenous antibiotics, and will provide a platform for the future redesign of these catalysts for antibiotic remodelling.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Glycopeptide resistance has been studied in detail in enterococci and staphylococci. In these microorganisms, high-level resistance is achieved by replacing the C-terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine of the nascent peptidoglycan with D-alanyl-D-lactate or D-alanyl-D-serine, thus reducing the affinities of glycopeptides for cell wall targets. Reorganization of the cell wall is directed by the expression of the van gene clusters. The identification of van gene homologs in the genomes of several glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes suggests the involvement of a similar self-resistance mechanism to avoid suicide. This report describes a comprehensive study of self-resistance in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus ATCC 31121, the producer of the clinically relevant glycopeptide teicoplanin. A. teichomyceticus ATCC 31121 showed a MIC of teicoplanin of 25 microg/ml and a MIC of vancomycin of 90 microg/ml during vegetative growth. The vanH, vanA, and vanX genes of A. teichomyceticus were found to be organized in an operon whose transcription was constitutive. Analysis of the UDP-linked peptidoglycan precursors revealed the presence of UDP-glycomuramyl pentadepsipeptide terminating in D-alanyl-D-lactate. No trace of precursors ending in d-alanyl-d-alanine was detected. Thus, the van gene complex was transcribed and expressed in the genetic background of A. teichomyceticus and conferred resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin through the modification of cell wall biosynthesis. During teicoplanin production (maximum productivity, 70 to 80 microg/ml), the MIC of teicoplanin remained in the range of 25 to 35 microg/ml. Teicoplanin-producing cells were found to be tolerant to high concentrations of exogenously added glycopeptides, which were not bactericidal even at 5,000 microg/ml.",

The complete friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster of 24 open reading frames from A. friuliensis was sequenced and analyzed. In addition to genes for regulation, self-resistance, and transport, the cluster contains genes encoding peptide synthetases, proteins involved in the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component of the antibiotic, and proteins involved in the synthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acids pipecolinic acid, methylaspartic acid, and 2,3-diaminobutyric acid. By using heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli, we provide biochemical evidence for the stereoselective synthesis of L-pipecolinic acid by the deduced protein of the lysine cyclodeaminase gene pip.

        "pmc_abstract": "The pyrrolomycins are a family of polyketide antibiotics, some of which contain a nitro group. To gain insight into the nitration mechanism associated with the formation of these antibiotics, the pyrrolomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Actinosporangium vitaminophilum was cloned. Sequencing of ca. 56 kb of A. vitaminophilum DNA revealed 35 open reading frames (ORFs). Sequence analysis revealed a clear relationship between some of these ORFs and the biosynthetic gene cluster for pyoluteorin, a structurally related antibiotic. Since a gene transfer system could not be devised for A. vitaminophilum, additional proof for the identity of the cloned gene cluster was sought by cloning the pyrrolomycin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. strain UC 11065, a transformable pyrrolomycin producer. Sequencing of ca. 26 kb of UC 11065 DNA revealed the presence of 17 ORFs, 15 of which exhibit strong similarity to ORFs in the A. vitaminophilum cluster as well as a nearly identical organization. Single-crossover disruption of two genes in the UC 11065 cluster abolished pyrrolomycin production in both cases. These results confirm that the genetic locus cloned from UC 11065 is essential for pyrrolomycin production, and they also confirm that the highly similar locus in A. vitaminophilum encodes pyrrolomycin biosynthetic genes. Sequence analysis revealed that both clusters contain genes encoding the two components of an assimilatory nitrate reductase. This finding suggests that nitrite is required for the formation of the nitrated pyrrolomycins. However, sequence analysis did not provide additional insights into the nitration process, suggesting the operation of a novel nitration mechanism.",

To ensure proper function, transmembrane signal-transducing systems, such as two-component systems (TCS) and extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors, closely monitor its condition and respond to harmful perturbations. Both systems consist of a transmembrane sensor protein (histidine kinase or anti-sigma factor, respectively) and a corresponding cytoplasmic transcriptional regulator (response regulator or sigma factor, respectively) that mediates the cellular response through differential gene expression. The regulatory network of the cell envelope stress response is well studied in the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. It consists of at least two ECF sigma factors and four two-component systems. In this study, we describe the corresponding network in a close relative, Bacillus licheniformis. Based on sequence homology, domain architecture, and genomic context, we identified five TCS and eight ECF sigma factors as potential candidate regulatory systems mediating cell envelope stress response in this organism. We characterized the corresponding regulatory network by comparative transcriptomics and regulon mining as an initial screening tool. Subsequent in-depth transcriptional profiling was applied to define the inducer specificity of each identified cell envelope stress sensor. A total of three TCS and seven ECF sigma factors were shown to be induced by cell envelope stress in B. licheniformis. We noted a number of significant differences, indicative of a regulatory divergence between the two Bacillus species, in addition to the expected overlap in the respective responses.",

Southern analysis and DNA sequencing revealed amplification of a large genomic segment including the entire Km biosynthetic gene cluster in the chromosome of strain 12-6. At 145 kb, the amplifiable unit of DNA (AUD) is the largest AUD reported in Streptomyces. Striking repetitive DNA sequences belonging to the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats family were found in the AUD and may play a role in its amplification. Strain 12-6 contains a mixture of different chromosomes with varying numbers of AUDs, sometimes exceeding 36 copies and producing an amplified region >5.7 Mb. The level of Km production depended on the copy number of the Km biosynthetic gene cluster, suggesting that DNA amplification occurred during strain improvement as a consequence of selection for increased Km resistance. Amplification of DNA segments including entire antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters might be a common mechanism leading to increased antibiotic production in industrial strains.",

Sequence analysis of a 42.8-kbp DNA region revealed the presence of 36 open reading frames (ORFs) (one of them incomplete), 24 of which, spanning 26.5 kb, are probably involved in steffimycin biosynthesis. They code for all the activities required for polyketide biosynthesis, tailoring, regulation, and resistance but show no evidence of genes involved in L-rhamnose biosynthesis. The involvement of the cluster in steffimycin biosynthesis was confirmed by expression of a region of about 15 kb containing 15 ORFS, 11 of them forming part of the cluster, in the heterologous host Streptomyces albus, allowing the isolation of a biosynthetic intermediate. In addition, the expression in S. albus of the entire cluster, contained in a region of 34.8 kb, combined with the expression of plasmid pRHAM, directing the biosynthesis of L-rhamnose, led to the production of steffimycin. Inactivation of the stfX gene, coding for a putative cyclase, revealed that this enzymatic activity participates in the cyclization of the fourth ring, making the final steps in the biosynthesis of the steffimycin aglycon similar to those in the biosynthesis of jadomycin or rabelomycin. Inactivation of the stfG gene, coding for a putative glycosyltransferase involved in the attachment of L-rhamnose, allowed the production of a new compound corresponding to the steffimycin aglycon compound also observed in S. albus upon expression of the entire cluster.",

Encoded by genes within the mannopeptimycin biosynthetic gene cluster are enzymes responsible for the generation of the hexapeptide core (nonribosomal peptide synthetases [NRPS]) and tailoring reactions (mannosylation, isovalerylation, hydroxylation, and methylation). The NRPS system is noncanonical in that it has six modules utilizing only five amino acid-specific adenylation domains and it lacks a prototypical NRPS macrocyclizing thioesterase domain.

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Cereulide, a depsipeptide structurally related to valinomycin, is responsible for the emetic type of gastrointestinal disease caused by Bacillus cereus. Recently, it has been shown that this toxin is produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), but its exact genetic organization and biochemical synthesis is unknown.<h4>Results</h4>The complete sequence of the cereulide synthetase (ces) gene cluster, which encodes the enzymatic machinery required for the biosynthesis of cereulide, was dissected. The 24 kb ces gene cluster comprises 7 CDSs and includes, besides the typical NRPS genes like a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and two CDSs encoding enzyme modules for the activation and incorporation of monomers in the growing peptide chain, a CDS encoding a putative hydrolase in the upstream region and an ABC transporter in the downstream part. The enzyme modules responsible for incorporation of the hydroxyl acids showed an unusual structure while the modules responsible for the activation of the amino acids Ala and Val showed the typical domain organization of NRPS. The ces gene locus is flanked by genetic regions with high homology to virulence plasmids of B. cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus anthracis. PFGE and Southern hybridization showed that the ces genes are restricted to emetic B. cereus and indeed located on a 208 kb megaplasmid, which has high similarities to pXO1-like plasmids.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ces gene cluster that is located on a pXO1-like virulence plasmid represents, beside the insecticidal and the anthrax toxins, a third type of B. cereus group toxins encoded on megaplasmids. The ces genes are restricted to emetic toxin producers, but pXO1-like plasmids are also present in emetic-like strains. These data might indicate the presence of an ancient plasmid in B. cereus which has acquired different virulence genes over time. Due to the unusual structure of the hydroxyl acid incorporating enzyme modules of Ces, substantial biochemical efforts will be required to dissect the complete biochemical pathway of cereulide synthesis.",

Three iturin group operons (i.e., iturin A, mycosubtilin, and bacillomycin D) of those antibiotic-producing strains have been cloned and sequenced thus far, strongly implying the horizontal transfer of these operons. To examine the nature of such horizontal transfer in terms of antibiotic production, a 42-kb region of the B. subtilis RB14 genome, which contains a complete 38-kb iturin A operon, was transferred via competent cell transformation to the genome of a non-iturin A producer, B. subtilis 168, using a method based on double-crossover homologous recombination with two short landing pad sequences (LPSs) in the genome. The recombinant was positively selected by confirming the elimination of the cI repressor gene, which was localized between the two LPSs and substituted by the transferred segment. The iturin A operon-transferred strain 168 was then converted into an iturin A producer by the introduction of an sfp gene, which encodes 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase and is mutated in strain 168. By inserting the pleiotropic regulator degQ, the productivity of iturin A increased sevenfold and was restored to about half that of the donor strain RB14, without the transfer of additional genes, such as regulatory or self-resistance genes.",

Mutations in pltI and pltJ, which are predicted to encode a membrane fusion protein and an ATP-binding cassette of the ABC transporter, respectively, greatly reduced pyoluteorin production by Pf-5. During the transition from exponential growth to stationary phase, populations of a pltI mutant were lower than those of a pltI+ strain in a culture medium containing pyoluteorin, suggesting a role for the transport system in efflux and the resistance of Pf-5 to the antibiotic. Although pltI or pltJ mutant strains displayed low pyoluteorin production, they did not accumulate proportionately more of the antibiotic intracellularly, indicating that pltI and pltJ do not encode an exclusive exporter for pyoluteorin. Transcription of the putative pyoluteorin efflux genes pltI and pltJ was enhanced by exogenous pyoluteorin. These new observations parallel an earlier finding that pyoluteorin enhances the transcription of pyoluteorin biosynthesis genes and pyoluteorin production in Pf-5. This report provides evidence of a coordination of pyoluteorin production and the transcription of genes encoding a linked transport apparatus, wherein each requires the other for optimal expression.",

DNA sequence analysis of a 74-kb region revealed the presence of 28 complete open reading frames (ORFs), 22 of them belonging to the biosynthetic gene cluster. Central to the cluster is a polyketide synthase locus that encodes an eight-module system comprised of four multifunctional proteins. In addition, one ORF shows homology to those for nonribosomal peptide synthetases, indicating that alpha-lipomycin belongs to the classification of hybrid peptide-polyketide natural products. Furthermore, the lip cluster includes genes responsible for the formation and attachment of d-digitoxose as well as ORFs that resemble those for putative regulatory and export functions. We generated biosynthetic mutants by insertional gene inactivation. By analysis of culture extracts of these mutants, we could prove that, indeed, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipomycin had been cloned, and additionally we gained insight into an unusual biosynthesis pathway.",

Despite extensive research with many organisms, its role in Streptomyces sp. remains unclear. In the present study, the putative SAM-s gene was isolated from a spectinomycin producer, Streptomyces spectabilis. The purified protein from the transformed Escherichia coli with the isolated gene synthesized SAM from L-methionine and ATP in vitro, strongly indicating that the isolated gene indeed encoded the SAM-s protein. The overexpression of the SAM-s gene in Streptomyces lividans TK23 inhibited sporulation and aerial mycelium formation but enhanced the production of actinorhodin in both agar plates and liquid media. Surprisingly, the overexpressed SAM was proven by Northern analysis to increase the production of actinorhodin through the induction of actII-ORF4, a transcription activator of actinorhodin biosynthetic gene clusters. In addition, we found that a certain level of intracellular SAM is critical for the induction of antibiotic biosynthetic genes, since the control strain harboring only the plasmid DNA did not show any induction of actII-ORF4 until it reached a certain level of SAM in the cell. From these results, we concluded that the SAM plays important roles as an intracellular factor in both cellular differentiation and antibiotic production in Streptomyces sp.",

These antibiotics are also being investigated for their targeting of the catalytic RNAs involved in viral replication and for the treatment of bacterial infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. We report on the isolation, sequencing, and annotation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for one member of this antibiotic family, viomycin, from Streptomyces sp. strain ATCC 11861. This is the first gene cluster for a member of the tuberactinomycin family of antibiotics sequenced, and the information gained can be extrapolated to all members of this family. The gene cluster covers 36.3 kb of DNA and encodes 20 open reading frames that we propose are involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, export, and activation of viomycin, in addition to self-resistance to the antibiotic. These results enable us to predict the metabolic logic of tuberactinomycin production and begin steps toward the combinatorial biosynthesis of these antibiotics to complement existing chemical modification techniques to produce novel tuberactinomycin derivatives.",

We report the identification and characterization of a cluster of eight genes (named cpmA to cpmH) responsible for the production of a carbapenem-like antibiotic in strain TT01 of P. luminescens. The cpm cluster differs in several crucial aspects from other car operons. The level of cpm mRNA peaks during exponential phase and is regulated by a Rap/Hor homolog identified in the P. luminescens genome. Marker-exchange mutagenesis of this gene in the entomopathogen decreased antibiotic production. The luxS-like signaling mechanism of quorum sensing also plays a role in the regulation of the cpm operon. Indeed, luxS, which is involved in the production of a newly identified autoinducer, is responsible for repression of cpm gene expression at the end of the exponential growth phase. The importance of this carbapenem production in the ecology of P. luminescens is discussed.",

This review examines the regulation of bacterial drug efflux systems, which occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Investigations into these regulatory networks have yielded a substantial volume of information that has either not been forthcoming from or complements that obtained by analysis of the transport proteins themselves. Several local regulatory proteins, including the activator BmrR from Bacillus subtilis and the repressors QacR from Staphylococcus aureus and TetR and EmrR from Escherichia coli, have been shown to mediate increases in the expression of drug efflux genes by directly sensing the presence of the toxic substrates exported by their cognate pump. This ability to bind transporter substrates has permitted detailed structural information to be gathered on protein-antimicrobial agent-ligand interactions. In addition, bacterial multidrug efflux determinants are frequently controlled at a global level and may belong to stress response regulons such as E. coli mar, expression of which is controlled by the MarA and MarR proteins. However, many regulatory systems are ill-adapted for detecting the presence of toxic pump substrates and instead are likely to respond to alternative signals related to unidentified physiological roles of the transporter. Hence, in a number of important pathogens, regulatory mutations that result in drug transporter overexpression and concomitant elevated antimicrobial resistance are often observed.",

A 12.8-kb region from R. gnavus E1 chromosome, containing the biosynthetic gene cluster of RumA, has been cloned and sequenced. It consisted of 13 open reading frames, organized in three operons with predicted functions in lantibiotic biosynthesis, signal transduction regulation, and immunity. One unusual feature of the locus is the presence of three almost identical structural genes, all of them encoding the RumA precursor. In order to determine the role of trypsin in RumA production, the transcription of the rum genes has been investigated under inducing and noninducing conditions. Trypsin activity is needed for the growth phase-dependent transcriptional activation of RumA operons. Our results suggest that bacteriocin production by R. gnavus E1 is controlled through a complex signaling mechanism involving the proteolytic processing of a putative extracellular inducer-peptide by trypsin, a specific environmental cue of the digestive ecosystem.",

These antibiotics also provide fascinating examples of the chemical and associated biosynthetic complexity exploitable in the synthesis of natural products by actinomycetes group of bacteria. We report the sequencing and annotation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the glycopeptide antibiotic from Streptomyces toyocaensis NRRL15009, the first complete sequence for a teicoplanin class glycopeptide. The cluster includes 34 ORFs encompassing 68 kb and includes all of the genes predicted to be required to synthesize and regulate its biosynthesis. The gene cluster also contains ORFs encoding enzymes responsible for glycopeptide resistance. This role was confirmed by insertional inactivation of the d-Ala-d-lactate ligase, vanAst, which resulted in the predicted -sensitive phenotype and impaired antibiotic biosynthesis. These results provide increased understanding of the biosynthesis of these complex natural products.",

Subcloning of a 4.0-kb BclI fragment revealed the presence of an MC resistance determinant, mrd. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified an open reading frame consisting of 130 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 14,364. Transcriptional analysis revealed that mrd is expressed constitutively, with increased transcription in the presence of MC. Expression of mrd in Escherichia coli resulted in the synthesis of a soluble protein with an Mr of 14,400 that conferred high-level cellular resistance to MC and a series of structurally related natural products. Purified MRD was shown to function as a drug-binding protein that provides protection against cross-linking of DNA by preventing reductive activation of MC.",

Lethbridge, S.J. Raffel, H. He, J. Clardy, and J. Handelsman, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:2023-2030, 1994). To identify a determinant for resistance to zwittermicin A, we constructed a genomic library from B. cereus UW85, which produces zwittermicin A, and screened transformants of Escherichia coli DH5alpha, which is sensitive to zwittermicin A, for resistance to zwittermicin A. Subcloning and mutagenesis defined a genetic locus, designated zmaR, on a 1.2-kb fragment of DNA that conferred zwittermicin A resistance on E. coli. A DNA fragment containing zmaR hybridized to a corresponding fragment of genomic DNA from B. cereus UW85. Corresponding fragments were not detected in mutants of B. cereus UW85 that were sensitive to zwittermicin A, and the plasmids carrying zmaR restored resistance to the zwittermicin A-sensitive mutants, indicating that zmaR was deleted in the zwittermicin A-sensitive mutants and that zmaR is functional in B. cereus. Sequencing of the 1.2-kb fragment of DNA defined an open reading frame, designated ZmaR. Neither the nucleotide sequence nor the predicted protein sequence had significant similarity to sequences in existing databases. Cell extracts from an E. coli strain carrying zmaR contained a 43.5-kDa protein whose molecular mass and N-terminal sequence matched those of the protein predicted by the zmaR sequence. The results demonstrate that we have isolated a gene, zmaR, that encodes a zwIttermicin A resistance determinant that is functional in both B. cereus and E. coli.",

Expression of drrC was correlated with the timing of DNR production in the growth medium tested and was not dependent on the presence of DNR. Since introduction of drrC into Streptomyces lividans imparted a DNR resistance phenotype, this gene is believed to be a DNR resistance gene. The drrC gene could be disrupted in the non-DNR-producing S. peucetius dnrJ mutant but not in the wild-type strain, and the resulting dnrJ drrC double mutant was significantly more sensitive to DNR in efficiency-of-plating experiments. Expression of drrC in an E. coli uvrA strain conferred significant DNR resistance to this highly DNR-sensitive mutant. However, the DrrC protein did not complement the uvrA mutation to protect the mutant from the lethal effects of UV or mitomycin even though it enhanced the UV resistance of a uvrA+ strain. We speculate that the DrrC protein mediates a novel type of DNR resistance, possibly different from the mechanism of DNR resistance governed by the S. peucetius drrAB genes, which are believed to encode a DNR antiporter.",

The inactivated product of virginiamycin M1 was isolated, and structure analysis revealed that the inactivation involves reduction of a C-16 carbonyl group leading to the formation of 16-dihydrovirginiamycin M1. Acetonide and benzylidene acetal derivatives were synthesized from the two hydroxyl groups on C-14 and C-16, and the C-16 stereochemistry was determined by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Two methyl groups of the acetonide derivative gave 13C signals of 20.1 and 30.1 ppm, indicating that the relative stereochemistry of the C-14 and C-16 hydroxy groups is syn. Furthermore, irradiation of the benzylidene methine proton gave clear nuclear Overhauser effect enhancement of the C-14 or C-16 methine protons, indicating that H-14 and H-16 were in an axial configuration. From the (14S) absolute configuration of natural virginiamycin M1 and the syn relative configuration for the C-14 and C-16 hydroxyl groups of the inactivated product, the C-16 absolute configuration of the inactivated product was thus identified as R.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The aklavinone 11-hydroxylase gene and two doxorubicin resistance genes cloned from Streptomyces peucetius subsp. caesius ATCC 27952 were introduced into doxorubicin-sensitive Streptomyces galilaeus ATCC 31133, an aclacinomycin producer. The doxorubicin resistance genes drrA and drrB endowed S. galilaeus with high-level resistance to doxorubicin, indicating that the resistance mechanism for doxorubicin might be different from that for aclacinomycin A. Transformation of S. galilaeus ATCC 31133 with plasmid pMC213 containing the aklavinone 11-hydroxylase gene (dnrF) resulted in the production of many red pigments. A new metabolite was purified, and the position of the newly introduced hydroxyl group was determined. This result indicated that the aklavinone 11-hydroxylase gene was stably expressed in S. galilaeus ATCC 31133 and that it gave rise to a hybrid aclacinomycin A which showed highly specific in vitro cytotoxicity against leukemia and melanoma cell lines.",

        "pmc_abstract": "We previously proposed that the adjacent dnrIJ genes represent a two-component regulatory system controlling daunorubicin biosynthesis in Streptomyces peucetius on the basis of the homology of the DnrI and DnrJ proteins to other response regulator proteins and the effect of a dnrI::aphII mutation. In the present paper we report the results of work with the dnrI::aphII mutant in complementation, bioconversion, and transcriptional analysis experiments to understand the function of dnrI. For five putative operons in the sequenced portion of the S. peucetius daunorubicin biosynthesis gene cluster examined, all of the potential transcripts are present in the delta dnrJ mutant and wild-type strains but absent in the dnrI::aphII strain. Since these transcripts code for both early- and late-acting enzymes in daunorubicin biosynthesis, dnrI seems to control all of the daunorubicin biosynthesis genes directly or indirectly. Transcriptional mapping of the 5' and 3' ends of the dnrIJ transcript and the termination site of the convergently transcribed dnrZUV transcript reveals, interestingly, that the two transcripts share extensive complementarity in the regions coding for daunorubicin biosynthesis enzymes. In addition, dnrI may regulate the expression of the drrAB and drrC daunorubicin resistance genes. The delta dnrJ mutant accumulates epsilon-rhodomycinone, the aglycone precursor of daunorubicin. Since this mutant contains transcripts coding for several early- and late-acting enzymes and since dnr mutants blocked in deoxysugar biosynthesis accumulate epsilon-rhodomycinone, we conclude that dnrJ is a daunosamine biosynthesis gene. Moreover, newly available gene sequence data show that the DnrJ protein resembles a group of putative aminotransferase enzymes, suggesting that the role of DnrJ is to add an amino group to an intermediate of daunosamine biosynthesis.",

A DNA fragment which induced aerial mycelium formation and sporulation in an A-factor-deficient mutant strain, S. griseus HH1, was cloned from this mutant strain. Subcloning experiments and nucleotide sequencing showed that two open reading frames, ORF1 with 656 amino acids and ORF2 with 201 amino acids, were required in order to induce sporulation. The amino acid sequence of ORF1 significantly resembled that of the Escherichia coli HlyB protein, a member of a family of bacterial membrane proteins engaged in ATP-dependent secretion mechanisms. Conserved features of this surface translocator family, such as the transmembrane structure predicted by their hydropathy profiles and the amino acid sequence forming an ATP-binding fold, were also conserved in ORF1. The ORF1 gene appeared to constitute a transcriptional unit with an additional upstream gene encoding ORF3, which was greatly similar to ORF1 in size and amino acid sequence. The other protein, ORF2, showed significant end-to-end homology with the E. coli uhpA product, a regulatory protein for the uptake of sugar phosphates. Like UhpA as a response regulator of a bacterial two-component regulatory system, ORF2 contained a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain at its COOH-terminal portion and an Asp residue (Asp-54) probably to be phosphorylated at its NH2-terminal portion. An amino acid replacement from Asp-54 to Asn resulted in the loss of the ability of ORF2 to induce sporulation in strain HH1.",

From a screen of 3,400 kanamycin-resistant transconjugants, seven independent mutants that do not produce tabtoxin (Tox-) were isolated. Although the Tn5 insertions within these seven mutants were linked, they were not located in the previously described tabtoxin biosynthetic region of P. syringae. Instead, all of the insertions were within the P. syringae pv. coronafaciens lemA gene. The lemA gene is required by strains of P. syringae pv. syringae for pathogenicity on bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris). In contrast to the phenotype of a P. syringae pv. syringae lemA mutant, the Tox- mutants of P. syringae pv. coronafaciens were still able to produce necrotic lesions on oat plants (Avena sativa), although without the chlorosis associated with tabtoxin production. Northern (RNA) hybridization experiments indicated that a functional lemA gene was required for the detection of a transcript produced from the tblA locus located in the tabtoxin biosynthetic region. Marker exchange mutagenesis of the tblA locus resulted in loss of tabtoxin production. Therefore, both the tblA and lemA genes are required for tabtoxin biosynthesis, and the regulation of tabtoxin production by lemA probably occurs at the transcriptional level.",

A simple and reliable assay for this antibiotic was developed. Conditions that permit the synthesis of methylenomycin by S. coelicolor cultures grown in defined medium were elucidated: a readily assimilated carbon and nitrogen source is required. Under these conditions methylenomycin is produced late in the growth phase, at the time of transition from exponential to linear growth. Provided that the phosphate concentration in the medium is kept high, there is synthesis of methylenomycin but not of the other secondary metabolites that this strain can produce. These conditions were used to study the transcription of the methylenomycin gene cluster during the transition from primary to secondary metabolism. The biosynthetic genes of at least one of the mmy transcription units appear to be transcribed before the mmr resistance determinant. The possibility that methylenomycin induces the transcription of mmr is discussed.",

When introduced into the wild-type ATCC 29050 strain, the 2.0-kb dnrR1 segment caused a 10-fold overproduction of epsilon-rhodomycinone, a key intermediate of daunorubicin biosynthesis, whereas the 1.9-kb dnrR2 segment increased production of both epsilon-rhodomycinone and daunorubicin 10- and 2-fold, respectively. In addition, the dnrR2 segment restored high-level daunorubicin resistance to strain H6101, a daunorubicin-sensitive mutant of S. peucetius subsp. caesius ATCC 27952. Analysis of the sequence of the dnrR1 fragment revealed the presence of two closely situated open reading frames, dnrI and dnrJ, whose deduced products exhibit high similarity to the products of several other Streptomyces genes that have been implicated in the regulation of secondary metabolism. Insertional inactivation of dnrI in the ATCC 29050 strain with the Tn5 kanamycin resistance gene abolished epsilon-rhodomycinone and daunorubicin production and markedly decreased resistance to daunorubicin. Sequence comparison between the products of dnrIJ and the products of the Streptomyces coelicolor actII-orf4, afsR, and redD-orf1 genes and of the Streptomyces griseus strS, the Saccharopolyspora erythraea eryC1, and the Bacillus stearothermophilus degT genes reveals two families of putative regulatory genes. The members of the DegT, DnrJ, EryC1, and StrS family exhibit some of the features characteristic of the protein kinase (sensor) component of two-component regulatory systems from other bacteria (even though none of the sequences of these four proteins show a significant overall or regional similarity to such protein kinases) and have a consensus helix-turn-helix motif typical of DNA binding proteins. A helix-turn-helix motif is also present in two of the proteins of the other family, AfsR and RedD-Orf1. Both sets of Streptomyces proteins are likely to be trans-acting factors involved in regulating secondary metabolism.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Cercospora kikuchii is a fungal pathogen of soybeans which produces a photosensitizing phytotoxic polyketide metabolite, cercosporin. Cercosporin synthesis in culture is modulated by several environmental factors. In addition to the light requirement for toxin action, cercosporin biosynthesis is also highly light regulated. As a first step towards identifying genes involved in cercosporin regulation and biosynthesis, we have used subtractive hybridization to isolate light-enhanced cDNA clones. Six distinct cDNA clones representing genes from a wild-type C. kikuchii strain for which transcript accumulation is positively regulated by light were isolated. To assess the relationship of these light-enhanced cDNAs to cercosporin biosynthesis, we compared corresponding steady-state RNA levels in the wild type and in three mutant strains altered in toxin biosynthesis. Two of the mutant C. kikuchii strains which fail to accumulate cercosporin in response to light also fail to exhibit light-enhanced accumulation of transcripts corresponding to all six light-enhanced cDNAs. Cercosporin accumulation in the third mutant strain, S2, is regulated by medium composition as well as light. S2 fails to accumulate cercosporin in complete medium, a medium which allows significant cercosporin accumulation by the wild-type strain. When cultured in complete medium, this mutant strain also fails to show the wild-type, light-enhanced accumulation of transcripts corresponding to five of the six light-enhanced cDNAs. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that transcript accumulation for two of the six light-enhanced cDNAs strongly paralleled cercosporin accumulation in light-grown wild-type culture.",

Restriction mapping and Southern analysis of the DNA cloned in a cosmid vector established that the DNA represented three nonoverlapping regions of the S. peucetius subsp. caesius genome. These three regions plus an additional one that hybridized to the same probes are present in the S. peucetius genome, as reported previously (K. J. Stutzman-Engwall and C. R. Hutchinson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:3135-3139, 1989). Functional analysis of representative clones from some of these regions in S. lividans, S. peucetius ATCC 29050, S. peucetius subsp. caesius ATCC 27952, and two of its blocked mutants (strains H6101 and H6125) showed that many of the antibiotic production genes reside in the region of DNA represented by the group IV clones. This conclusion is based on the production of epsilon-rhodomycinone, a key intermediate of the daunorubicin pathway, in certain S. lividans transformants and on the apparent complementation of mutations that block daunorubicin biosynthesis in strains H6101 and H6125. Some of the transformants of strains 29050, 27952, and H6125 exhibited substantial overproduction of epsilon-rhodomycinone and daunorubicin.",

As judged by growth rates before and after exposure to sub-MICs of glycopeptides, vancomycin and 62476 induced self-resistance, 62208 and 62211 induced slight self-resistance, and teicoplanin did not induce self-resistance. Vancomycin induced cross-resistance to all other glycopeptides tested, as judged both in growth experiments and by direct measurement of inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in cells exposed to sub-MICs of vancomycin. Thus, the spectra of activity of the glycopeptides were not correlated with their patterns of induction. There was a correlation between the increased synthesis of a 39-kilodalton (kDa) protein located in the cytoplasmic membrane and the induction of resistance. Protoplasts of A256 were susceptible to inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis by vancomycin at levels similar to those for susceptible strains. Vancomycin resistance was transferable on filters from the parent strain to E. faecalis JH2-2 at a frequency of about 10(-7), and the 39-kDa protein was also inducible by glycopeptides in these transconjugants. We conclude that A256 is resistant to glycopeptides by virtue of the synthesis of a 39-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein, that this protein is probably involved in preventing access of the glycopeptides to their peptidoglycan targets, and that this resistance is transferable, probably by conjugation.",

Subcloning experiments located the aacC7 structural gene on a 1.05-kilobase DNA sequence. The direction of transcription of aacC7 was determined by using riboprobes synthesized in vitro from a DNA fragment internal to the gene. A DNA segment encoding the AAC(3)-VII activity and comprising 1,495 base pairs was sequenced. The aacC7 gene was located in an open reading frame of 864 base pairs that encoded a polypeptide of Mr 31,070, consistent with the Mr (32,000) of the AAC(3)-VII enzyme as determined by physicochemical methods. High-resolution S1 nuclease mapping suggested that transcription starts at or near the A residue of the ATG initiator codon. A DNA fragment from the 5' region of aacC7 had promoter activity in the promoter-probe plasmid pIJ486. The -10 and -35 regions of this fragment showed limited sequence resemblance to other Streptomyces promoters. The primary structure of the AAC(3)-VII enzyme showed strong homology with those of the AAC(3)-III and AAC(3)-IV enzymes encoded by plasmids in gram-negative bacterial genera. Upstream of the aacC7 gene was an open reading frame of 357 nucleotides which did not appear to be involved in controlling the expression of the aacC7 gene.",

Ribosomes prepared from this organism grown in either production or nonproduction medium were fully sensitive to paromomycin. A paromomycin acetyltransferase and a paromomycin phosphotransferase, both characteristic of the producer, were highly purified from extracts prepared from two Streptomyces lividans transformants harboring the relevant genes inserted in pIJ702-derived plasmids. In vitro, paromomycin was inactivated by either activity. In vivo, however, S. lividans clones containing the gene for either enzyme inserted in the low-copy-number plasmid pIJ41 were resistant to only low levels of paromomycin. In contrast, an S. lividans transformant containing both genes inserted in the same pIJ41-derived plasmid displayed high levels of resistance to paromomycin. These results indicate that both genes are required to determine the high levels of resistance to this drug in the producing organism. Paromomycin is doubly modified by the enzymes. However, whereas acetylparomomycin was a poorer substrate than paromomycin for the phosphotransferase, phosphorylparomomycin was modified more actively than was the intact drug by the acetyltransferase. These findings are discussed in terms of both a permeability barrier to paromomycin and the possible role(s) of the two enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of this antibiotic.",

        "pmc_abstract": "A gene cluster was identified which contains genes involved in the biosynthesis of actinomycin encompassing 50 kb of contiguous DNA on the chromosome of Streptomyces chrysomallus. It contains 28 genes with biosynthetic functions and is bordered on both sides by IS elements. Unprecedentedly, the cluster consists of two large inverted repeats of 11 and 13 genes, respectively, with four nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes in the middle. Nine genes in each repeat have counterparts in the other, in the same arrangement but in the opposite orientation, suggesting an inverse duplication of one of the arms during the evolution of the gene cluster. All of the genes appear to be organized into operons, each corresponding to a functional section of actinomycin biosynthesis, such as peptide assembly, regulation, resistance, and biosynthesis of the precursor of the actinomycin chromophore 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (4-MHA). For 4-MHA synthesis, functional analysis revealed genes that encode pathway-specific isoforms of tryptophan dioxygenase, kynurenine formamidase, and hydroxykynureninase, which are distinct from the corresponding enzyme activities of cellular tryptophan catabolism in their regulation and in part in their substrate specificity. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the pathway-specific tryptophan metabolism in Streptomyces most probably evolved divergently from the normal pathway of tryptophan catabolism to provide an extra or independent supply of building blocks for the synthesis of tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Capuramycin-related compounds, including A-500359s and A-503083s, are nucleoside antibiotics that inhibit the enzyme bacterial translocase I involved in peptidoglycan cell wall biosynthesis. Within the biosynthetic gene cluster for the A-500359s exists a gene encoding a putative aminoglycoside 3-phosphotransferase that was previously demonstrated to be highly expressed during the production of A-500359s and confers selective resistance to capuramycins when expressed in heterologous hosts. A similar gene (capP) was identified within the biosynthetic gene cluster for the A-503083s, and CapP is now shown to similarly confer selective resistance to capuramycins. Recombinant CapP was produced and purified from Escherichia coli, and the function of CapP is established as an ATP-dependent capuramycin phosphotransferase that regio-specifically transfers the gamma-phosphate to the 3''-hydroxyl of the unsaturated hexuronic acid moiety of A-503083 B. Kinetic analysis with the three major A-503083 congeners suggests that CapP preferentially phosphorylates A-503083s containing an aminocaprolactam moiety attached to the hexuronic acid, and bi-substrate kinetic analysis was consistent with CapP employing a sequential kinetic mechanism similar to most known aminoglycoside 3-phosphotransferases. The purified CapP product lost its antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, and this loss in bioactivity is primarily due to a 272-fold increase in the IC(50) in the bacterial translocase I-catalyzed reaction. The results establish CapP-mediated phosphorylation as a mechanism of resistance to capuramycins and now set the stage to explore this strategy of resistance as a potential mechanism inherent to pathogens and provide the impetus for preparing second generation analogues as a preemptive strike to such resistance strategies.",

Independent expression of the S. lydicus and S. spectabilis rpoB and rpoC genes, encoding the beta- and beta'-subunits of RNA polymerase, respectively, in S. albus showed that resistance is mediated by rpoB, with no effect of rpoC. Within the beta-subunit, resistance was confined to an amino acid region harboring the \"rif region.\" Comparison of the beta-subunit amino acid sequences of this region from the producer strains and those of other streptomycetes and site-directed mutagenesis of specific differential residues located in it (L485 and D486 in S. lydicus and N474 and S475 in S. spectabilis) showed their involvement in streptolydigin and streptovaricin resistance.

        "pmc_abstract": "In the present study, we successfully cloned a 21-kb DNA fragment containing a d-cycloserine (DCS) biosynthetic gene cluster from a DCS-producing Streptomyces lavendulae strain, ATCC 11924. The putative gene cluster consists of 10 open reading frames (ORFs), designated dcsA to dcsJ. This cluster includes two ORFs encoding D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase (dcsI) and a putative membrane protein (dcsJ) as the self-resistance determinants of the producer organism, indicated by our previous work. When the 10 ORFs were introduced into DCS-nonproducing Streptomyces lividans 66 as a heterologous host cell, the transformant acquired DCS productivity. This reveals that the introduced genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of DCS. As anticipated, the disruption of dcsG, seen in the DCS biosynthetic gene cluster, made it possible for the strain ATCC 11924 to lose its DCS production. We here propose the DCS biosynthetic pathway. First, L-serine is O acetylated by a dcsE-encoded enzyme homologous to homoserine O-acetyltransferase. Second, O-acetyl-L-serine accepts hydroxyurea via an O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase homolog (dcsD product) and forms O-ureido-L-serine. The hydroxyurea must be supplied by the catalysis of a dcsB-encoded arginase homolog using the L-arginine derivative, N(G)-hydroxy-L-arginine. The resulting O-ureido-L-serine is then racemized to O-ureido-D-serine by a homolog of diaminopimelate epimerase. Finally, O-ureido-D-serine is cyclized to form DCS with the release of ammonia and carbon dioxide. The cyclization must be done by the dcsG or dcsH product, which belongs to the ATP-grasp fold family of protein.",

These biosurfactants are produced mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and have been thoroughly investigated since their early discovery. Recently, they have attracted renewed attention because of their involvement in various multicellular behaviors. Despite this high interest, only very few studies have focused on the production of rhamnolipids by Burkholderia species.<h4>Results</h4>Orthologs of rhlA, rhlB and rhlC, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of rhamnolipids in P. aeruginosa, have been found in the non-infectious Burkholderia thailandensis, as well as in the genetically similar important pathogen B. pseudomallei. In contrast to P. aeruginosa, both Burkholderia species contain these three genes necessary for rhamnolipid production within a single gene cluster. Furthermore, two identical, paralogous copies of this gene cluster are found on the second chromosome of these bacteria. Both Burkholderia spp. produce rhamnolipids containing 3-hydroxy fatty acid moieties with longer side chains than those described for P. aeruginosa. Additionally, the rhamnolipids produced by B. thailandensis contain a much larger proportion of dirhamnolipids versus monorhamnolipids when compared to P. aeruginosa. The rhamnolipids produced by B. thailandensis reduce the surface tension of water to 42 mN/m while displaying a critical micelle concentration value of 225 mg/L. Separate mutations in both rhlA alleles, which are responsible for the synthesis of the rhamnolipid precursor 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acid, prove that both copies of the rhl gene cluster are functional, but one contributes more to the total production than the other. Finally, a double DeltarhlA mutant that is completely devoid of rhamnolipid production is incapable of swarming motility, showing that both gene clusters contribute to this phenotype.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Collectively, these results add another Burkholderia species to the list of bacteria able to produce rhamnolipids and this, by the means of two identical functional gene clusters. Our results also demonstrate the very impressive tensio-active properties these long-chain rhamnolipids possess in comparison to the well-studied short-chain ones from P. aeruginosa.",

        "pmc_abstract": "SF2575 1 is a tetracycline polyketide produced by Streptomyces sp. SF2575 and displays exceptionally potent anticancer activity toward a broad range of cancer cell lines. The structure of SF2575 is characterized by a highly substituted tetracycline aglycon. The modifications include methylation of the C-6 and C-12a hydroxyl groups, acylation of the 4-(S)-hydroxyl with salicylic acid, C-glycosylation of the C-9 of the D-ring with D-olivose and further acylation of the C4'-hydroxyl of D-olivose with the unusual angelic acid. Understanding the biosynthesis of SF2575 can therefore expand the repertoire of enzymes that can modify tetracyclines, and facilitate engineered biosynthesis of SF2575 analogues. In this study, we identified, sequenced, and functionally analyzed the ssf biosynthetic gene cluster which contains 40 putative open reading frames. Genes encoding enzymes that can assemble the tetracycline aglycon, as well as installing these unique structural features, are found in the gene cluster. Biosynthetic intermediates were isolated from the SF2575 culture extract to suggest the order of pendant-group addition is C-9 glycosylation, C-4 salicylation, and O-4' angelylcylation. Using in vitro assays, two enzymes that are responsible for C-4 acylation of salicylic acid were identified. These enzymes include an ATP-dependent salicylyl-CoA ligase SsfL1 and a putative GDSL family acyltransferase SsfX3, both of which were shown to have relaxed substrate specificity toward substituted benzoic acids. Since the salicylic acid moiety is critically important for the anticancer properties of SF2575, verification of the activities of SsfL1 and SsfX3 sets the stage for biosynthetic modification of the C-4 group toward structure-activity relationship studies of SF2575. Using heterologous biosynthesis in Streptomyces lividans, we also determined that biosynthesis of the SF2575 tetracycline aglycon 8 parallels that of oxytetracycline 4 and diverges after the assembly of 4-keto-anhydrotetracycline 51. The minimal ssf polyketide synthase together with the amidotransferase SsfD produced the amidated decaketide backbone that is required for the formation of 2-naphthacenecarboxamide skeleton. Additional enzymes, such as cyclases C-6 methyltransferase and C-4/C-12a dihydroxylase, were functionally reconstituted.",

In our present study, we crystallized BAT under both a terrestrial and a microgravity environment in the International Space Station. In addition to substrate-free BAT, the crystal structures of BAT in a binary complex with CoA and in a ternary complex with Bm and CoA were determined. BAT forms a dimer structure via interaction of its C-terminal domains in the monomers. However, each N-terminal domain in the dimer is positioned without mutual interaction. The tunnel observed in the N-terminal domain of BAT has two entrances: one that adopts a wide funnel-like structure necessary to accommodate the metal-binding domain of Bm, and another narrow entrance that accommodates acetyl-CoA (AcCoA). A groove formed on the dimer interface of two BAT C-terminal domains accommodates the DNA-binding domain of Bm. In a ternary complex of BAT, BmA(2), and CoA, a thiol group of CoA is positioned near the primary amine of Bm at the midpoint of the tunnel. This proximity ensures efficient transfer of an acetyl group from AcCoA to the primary amine of Bm. Based on the BAT crystal structure and the enzymatic kinetic study, we propose that the catalytic mode of BAT takes an ordered-like mechanism.",

Deletion of hyg26 from the hygromycin A biosynthetic gene cluster has previously been shown to result in a mutant that produces 5''-dihydrohygromycin A (DHHA). We report herein on the purification and characterization of Hyg26 expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme catalyzes an NAD(H)-dependent reversible interconversion of HA and DHHA, supporting the role of the reduced HA as the penultimate biosynthetic pathway intermediate and not a shunt product. The equilibrium for the Hyg26-catalyzed reaction heavily favors the DHHA intermediate. The high-titer production of the HA product by S. hygroscopicus must be dependent upon a subsequent energetically favorable enzyme-catalyzed process, such as the selective and efficient export of HA. hyg19 encodes a putative proton gradient-dependent transporter, and a mutant lacking this gene was observed to produce less HA and to produce the DHHA intermediate. The DHHA produced by either the Deltahyg19 or the Deltahyg26 mutant had slightly reduced activity against E. coli and reduced protein synthesis-inhibitory activity in vitro. The data indicate that Hyg26 and Hyg19 have evolved to produce and export the final potent HA product in a coordinated fashion.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The Trojan horse antibiotic albomycin, produced by Streptomyces sp. strain ATCC 700974, contains a thioribosyl nucleoside moiety linked to a hydroxamate siderophore through a serine residue. The seryl nucleoside structure (SB-217452) is a potent inhibitor of seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) in the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of approximately 8 nM. In the albomycin-producing Streptomyces sp., a bacterial SerRS homolog (Alb10) was found to be encoded in a biosynthetic gene cluster in addition to another serRS gene (serS1) at a different genetic locus. Alb10, named SerRS2 herein, is significantly divergent from SerRS1, which shows high homology to the housekeeping SerRS found in other Streptomyces species. We genetically and biochemically characterized the two genes and the proteins encoded. Both genes were able to complement a temperature-sensitive serS mutant of Escherichia coli and allowed growth at a nonpermissive temperature. serS2 was shown to confer albomycin resistance, with specific amino acid residues in the motif 2 signature sequences of SerRS2 playing key roles. SerRS1 and SerRS2 are comparably efficient in vitro, but the K(m) of serine for SerRS2 measured during tRNA aminoacylation is more than 20-fold higher than that for SerRS1. SB-217452 was also enzymatically generated and purified by two-step chromatography. Its IC(50) against SerRS1 was estimated to be 10-fold lower than that against SerRS2. In contrast, both SerRSs displayed comparable inhibition kinetics for serine hydroxamate, indicating that SerRS2 was specifically resistant to SB-217452. These data suggest that mining Streptomyces genomes for duplicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes could provide a novel approach for the identification of natural products targeting aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.",

The transcription of both genes was observed by reverse transcription-PCR. Disruption of cmlR1 decreased the chloramphenicol MIC 1.6-fold, while disruption of cmlR2 lowered the MIC 16-fold. The chloramphenicol MIC of wild-type S. coelicolor decreased fourfold and eightfold in the presence of reserpine and Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide, respectively.

        "pmc_abstract": "Lantibiotic synthetases are remarkable biocatalysts generating conformationally constrained peptides with a variety of biological activities by repeatedly utilizing two simple posttranslational modification reactions: dehydration of Ser/Thr residues and intramolecular addition of Cys thiols to the resulting dehydro amino acids. Since previously reported lantibiotic synthetases show no apparent homology with any other known protein families, the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary origin of these enzymes are unknown. In this study, we present a novel class of lanthionine synthetases, termed LanL, that consist of three distinct catalytic domains and demonstrate in vitro enzyme activity of a family member from Streptomyces venezuelae. Analysis of individually expressed and purified domains shows that LanL enzymes install dehydroamino acids via phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues by a protein kinase domain and subsequent elimination of the phosphate by a phosphoSer/Thr lyase domain. The latter has sequence homology with the phosphothreonine lyases found in various pathogenic bacteria that inactivate host mitogen activated protein kinases. A LanC-like cyclase domain then catalyzes the addition of Cys residues to the dehydro amino acids to form the characteristic thioether rings. We propose that LanL enzymes have evolved from stand-alone protein Ser/Thr kinases, phosphoSer/Thr lyases, and enzymes catalyzing thiol alkylation. We also demonstrate that the genes for all three pathways to lanthionine-containing peptides are widespread in Nature. Given the remarkable efficiency of formation of lanthionine-containing polycyclic peptides and the latter's high degree of specificity for their cognate cellular targets, it is perhaps not surprising that (at least) three distinct families of polypeptide sequences have evolved to access this structurally and functionally diverse class of compounds.",

Here, the nucleoside methylation sites for three Kgm family methyltransferases, Sgm from Micromonospora zionensis, GrmA from Micromonospora echinospora and Krm from Frankia sp. Ccl3, were experimentally determined as G1405 by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. These results significantly extend the list of securely characterized G1405 modifying enzymes and experimentally validate their grouping into a single enzyme family. Heterologous expression of the KamB methyltransferase from Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius experimentally confirmed the requirement for an additional 60 amino acids on the deduced KamB N-terminus to produce an active methyltransferase acting at A1408, as previously suggested by an in silico analysis. Finally, the modifications at G1405 and A1408, were shown to confer partially overlapping but distinct resistance profiles in Escherichia coli. Collectively, these data provide a more secure and systematic basis for classification of new aminoglycoside resistance methyltransferases from producers and pathogenic bacteria on the basis of their sequences and resistance profiles.",

However, their clinical use is hampered frequently by their scarcity and undesirable toxicity. Not only can engineering Escherichia coli for plasmid-based pharmacophore biosynthesis offer alternative means of simple and easily scalable production of valuable yet hard-to-obtain compounds, but also carries a potential for providing a straightforward and efficient means of preparing natural product analogs. The quinomycin family of nonribosomal peptides, including echinomycin, triostin A, and SW-163s, are important secondary metabolites imparting antibiotic antitumor activity via DNA bisintercalation. Previously we have shown the production of echinomycin and triostin A in E. coli using our convenient and modular plasmid system to introduce these heterologous biosynthetic pathways into E. coli. However, we have yet to develop a novel biosynthetic pathway capable of producing bioactive unnatural natural products in E. coli. Here we report an identification of a new gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of SW-163s that involves previously unknown biosynthesis of (+)-(1S, 2S)-norcoronamic acid and generation of aliphatic side chains of various sizes via iterative methylation of an unactivated carbon center. Substituting an echinomycin biosynthetic gene with a gene from the newly identified SW-163 biosynthetic gene cluster, we were able to rationally re-engineer the plasmid-based echinomycin biosynthetic pathway for the production of a novel bioactive compound in E. coli.",

A region of more than 1.4 Mb was deleted stepwise from the 9.02-Mb S. avermitilis linear chromosome to generate a series of defined deletion mutants, corresponding to 83.12-81.46% of the wild-type chromosome, that did not produce any of the major endogenous secondary metabolites found in the parent strain. The suitability of the mutants as hosts for efficient production of foreign metabolites was shown by heterologous expression of three different exogenous biosynthetic gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of streptomycin (from S. griseus Institute for Fermentation, Osaka [IFO] 13350), cephamycin C (from S. clavuligerus American type culture collection (ATCC) 27064), and pladienolide (from S. platensis Mer-11107). Both streptomycin and cephamycin C were efficiently produced by individual transformants at levels higher than those of the native-producing species. Although pladienolide was not produced by a deletion mutant transformed with the corresponding intact biosynthetic gene cluster, production of the macrolide was enabled by introduction of an extra copy of the regulatory gene pldR expressed under control of an alternative promoter. Another mutant optimized for terpenoid production efficiently produced the plant terpenoid intermediate, amorpha-4,11-diene, by introduction of a synthetic gene optimized for Streptomyces codon usage. These findings highlight the strength and flexibility of engineered S. avermitilis as a model host for heterologous gene expression, resulting in the production of exogenous natural and unnatural metabolites.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Nocardicin A is a monocyclic beta-lactam isolated from the actinomycete Nocardia uniformis, which shows moderate activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative bacteria. Within the biosynthetic gene cluster of nocardicin A, nocR encodes a 583-amino-acid protein with high similarity to a class of transcriptional regulators known as streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins. Insertional inactivation of this gene resulted in a mutant showing morphology and growth characteristics similar to the wild type, but one that did not produce detectable levels of nocardicin A or the early precursor p-hydroxybenzoyl formate. Similar disruptions of nocD, nocE, and nocO yielded mutants that maintained production of nocardicin A at levels similar to the wild-type strain. In trans complementation of the nocR::apr mutant partially restored the wild-type phenotype. Transcriptional analysis of the nocR::apr mutant using reverse transcription-PCR found an absence of mRNA transcripts for the early-stage nocardicin A biosynthetic genes. In addition, transcription of the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of the nonproteinogenic p-hydroxyphenylglycine (pHPG) precursor was attenuated on the nocR disruption mutant. NocR was heterologously expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as an N-terminal maltose binding protein-tagged fusion protein. DNA binding assays demonstrated that NocR is a DNA binding protein, targeting the 126-bp intergenic region between nocF and nocA. Within this intergenic region is the likely binding motif, a direct hexameric repeat, TGATAA, with a 5-bp spacer. These experiments establish NocR as a positive transcriptional regulator of the nocardicin A biosynthetic pathway, coordinating the initial steps of nocardicin A biosynthesis to the production of its pHPG precursor.",

Resistance to the clinically relevant glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin, threatens to undermine the usefulness of this important class of antibiotics. DNA extracted from a geographically diverse collection of soil samples was screened by PCR for the presence of sequences related to OxyC, an oxidative coupling enzyme found in glycopeptide biosynthetic gene clusters. Every soil sample examined contained at least 1 unique OxyC gene sequence. In an attempt to access the biosynthetic gene clusters associated with these OxyC sequences, a 10,000,000-membered environmental DNA (eDNA) megalibrary was created from a single soil sample. Two unique glycopeptide gene clusters were recovered from this eDNA megalibrary. Using the teicoplanin aglycone and the 3 sulfotransferases found in one of these gene clusters, mono-, di-, and trisulfated glycopeptide congeners were produced. The high frequency with which OxyC genes were found in environmental samples indicates that soil eDNA libraries are likely to be a rewarding source of glycopeptide gene clusters. Enzymes found in these gene clusters should be useful for generating new glycopeptides analogs. Environmental DNA megalibraries, like the one constructed for this study, can provide access to many of the natural product biosynthetic gene clusters that are predicted to be present in soil microbiomes.",

Thus, it is appealing to consider that the pikromycin biosynthetic enzymes could be leveraged for high-throughput production of novel macrolide antibiotics. Accordingly, efforts over the past decade have focused on the detailed investigation of the six-module polyketide synthase, desosamine sugar assembly and glycosyl transfer, and the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that is responsible for hydroxylation. This review summarizes the advances in understanding of pikromycin biosynthesis that have been gained during the course of these investigations.",

The purpose of this study was to develop a method for recovery of the isoflavone glucosides as value-added coproducts at the end of either Saccharopolyspora erythraea or Aeromicrobium erythreum fermentation. Because the first step in isoflavone metabolism was known to be the conversion of isoflavone glucosides to aglycones by a beta-glucosidase, we chose to knock out the only beta-glucosidase gene known at the start of the study, eryBI, to see what effect this had on metabolism of isoflavone glucosides in each organism. In the unicellular erythromycin producer A. erythreum, knockout of eryBI was sufficient to block the conversion of isoflavone glucosides to aglycones. In S. erythraea, knockout of eryBI had no effect on this reaction, suggesting that other beta-glucosidases are present. Erythromycin production was not significantly affected in either strain as a result of the eryBI knockout. This study showed that isoflavone metabolism could be blocked in A. erythreum by eryBI knockout but that eryBI knockout was not sufficient to block isoflavone metabolism in S. erythraea.",

The andrimid biosynthetic gene cluster from Pantoea agglomerans encodes an admT gene with homology to the acetyl-CoA carboxyltransferase (CT) beta-subunit gene accD. Escherichia coli cells overexpressing admT showed resistance to andrimid. Co-overproduction of AdmT with E. coli CT alpha-subunit AccA allowed for the in vitro reconstitution of an active heterologous tetrameric CT A(2)T(2) complex. A subsequent andrimid-inhibition assay revealed an IC(50) of 500 nM for this hybrid A(2)T(2) in contrast to that of 12 nM for E. coli CT A(2)D(2). These results validated that AdmT is an AccD homolog that confers resistance in the andrimid producer. Mutagenesis studies guided by the x-ray crystal structure of the E. coli A(2)D(2) complex disclosed a single amino acid mutation of AdmT (L203M) responsible for 5-fold andrimid sensitivity (IC(50) = 100 nM). Complementarily, the E. coli AccD mutant M203L became 5-fold more resistant in the CT assays. This observation allowed for bioinformatic identification of several Vibrio cholerae strains in which accD genes encode the Met<-->Leu switches, and their occurrences correlate predictively with sensitivities to andrimid in vivo.",

These functional groups contribute to structural diversification and serve to improve the bioactivity profiles of natural products. Here, we have characterized in vitro two P450 enzymes from the mycinamicin biosynthetic pathway of Micromonospora griseorubida. First, MycCI was characterized as the C21 methyl hydroxylase of mycinamicin VIII, the earliest macrolide form in the postpolyketide synthase tailoring pathway. Moreover, we established that optimal activity of MycCI depends on the native ferredoxin MycCII. Second, MycG P450 catalyzes consecutive hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions with mycinamicin IV as initial substrate. These reactions require prior dimethylation of 6-deoxyallose to mycinose for effective conversion by the dual function MycG enzyme.",

Genetic engineering of the biosynthetic pathway in the producer strain would provide an efficient and convenient method of generating new derivatives of this complex molecule in vivo. However, the BLM producing Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 has been refractory to all means of introducing plasmid DNA into its cells for nearly two decades. Several years after cloning and identification of the bleomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, this study demonstrates, for the first time, genetic accessibility of this pharmaceutically relevant producer strain by intergeneric Escherichia coli-Streptomyces conjugation. Gene replacement and in-frame deletion mutants were created by lambdaRED-mediated PCR targeting mutagenesis, and the secondary metabolite profile of the resultant mutants confirmed the identity of the BLM biosynthetic gene cluster and established its boundaries. Ultimately, the in-frame blmD deletion mutant strain S. verticillus SB5 resulted in the production of a bleomycin intermediate. The structure of this compound, decarbamoyl-BLM, was elucidated, and its DNA cleavage activity was compared with the parent compounds.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Caprazamycins are potent anti-mycobacterial liponucleoside antibiotics isolated from Streptomyces sp. MK730-62F2 and belong to the translocase I inhibitor family. Their complex structure is derived from 5'-(beta-O-aminoribosyl)-glycyluridine and comprises a unique N-methyldiazepanone ring. The biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified, cloned, and sequenced, representing the first gene cluster of a translocase I inhibitor. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of 23 open reading frames putatively involved in export, resistance, regulation, and biosynthesis of the caprazamycins. Heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 led to the production of non-glycosylated bioactive caprazamycin derivatives. A set of gene deletions validated the boundaries of the cluster and inactivation of cpz21 resulted in the accumulation of novel simplified liponucleoside antibiotics that lack the 3-methylglutaryl moiety. Therefore, Cpz21 is assigned to act as an acyltransferase in caprazamycin biosynthesis. In vivo and in silico analysis of the caprazamycin biosynthetic gene cluster allows a first proposal of the biosynthetic pathway and provides insights into the biosynthesis of related uridyl-antibiotics.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The fosfomycin resistance protein FomA inactivates fosfomycin by phosphorylation of the phosphonate group of the antibiotic in the presence of ATP and Mg(II). We report the crystal structure of FomA from the fosfomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces wedmorensis in complex with diphosphate and in ternary complex with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)-triphosphate (AMPPNP), Mg(II), and fosfomycin, at 1.53 and 2.2 angstroms resolution, respectively. The polypeptide exhibits an open alphabetaalpha sandwich fold characteristic for the amino acid kinase family of enzymes. The diphosphate complex shows significant disorder in loops surrounding the active site. As a result, the nucleotide-binding site is wide open. Binding of the substrates is followed by the partial closure of the active site and ordering of the alpha2-helix. Structural comparison with N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase shows several similarities in the site of phosphoryl transfer: 1) preservation of architecture of the catalytical amino acids of N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (Lys9, Lys216, and Asp150 in FomA); 2) good superposition of the phosphate acceptor groups of the substrates, and 3) good superposition of the diphosphate molecule with the beta- and gamma-phosphates of AMPPNP, suggesting that the reaction could proceed by an associative in-line mechanism. However, differences in conformations of the triphosphate moiety of AMPPNP molecules, the long distance (5.1 angstroms) between the phosphate acceptor and donor groups in FomA, and involvement of Lys18 instead of Lys9 in binding with the gamma-phosphate may indicate a different reaction mechanism. The present work identifies the active site residues of FomA responsible for substrate binding and specificity and proposes their roles in catalysis.",

Here we report the identification of the Streptomyces rubellomurinus genes required for the biosynthesis of FR900098. Expression of these genes in Streptomyces lividans results in production of FR900098, demonstrating their role in synthesis of the antibiotic. Analysis of the putative gene products suggests that FR900098 is synthesized by metabolic reactions analogous to portions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

        "pmc_abstract": "The antibiotic hygromycin A (HA) binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits protein synthesis in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The HA biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 2388 contains 29 open reading frames, which have been assigned putative roles in biosynthesis, pathway regulation, and self-resistance. The hyg21 gene encodes an O-phosphotransferase with a proposed role in self-resistance. We observed that insertional inactivation of hyg21 in S. hygroscopicus leads to a greater than 90% decrease in HA production. The wild type and the hyg21 mutant were comparably resistant to HA. Using Escherichia coli as a heterologous host, we expressed and purified Hyg21. Kinetic analyses revealed that the recombinant protein catalyzes phosphorylation of HA (K(m) = 30 +/- 4 microM) at the C-2''' position of the fucofuranose ring in the presence of ATP (K(m) = 200 +/- 20 microM) or GTP (K(m) = 350 +/- 60 microM) with a k(cat) of 2.2 +/- 0.1 min(-1). The phosphorylated HA is inactive against HA-sensitive Delta tolC E. coli and Streptomyces lividans. Hyg21 also phosphorylates methoxyhygromycin A and desmethylenehygromycin A with k(cat) and K(m) values similar to those observed with HA. Phosphorylation of the naturally occurring isomers of 5'''-dihydrohygromycin A and 5'''-dihydromethoxyhygromycin A was about 12 times slower than for the corresponding non-natural isomers. These studies demonstrate that Hyg21 is an O-phosphotransferase with broad substrate specificity, tolerating changes in the aminocyclitol moiety more than in the fucofuranose moiety, and that phosphorylation by Hyg21 is one of several possible mechanisms of self-resistance in S. hygroscopicus NRRL 2388.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Lantibiotics are post-translationally modified peptide antimicrobial agents that are synthesized with an N-terminal leader sequence and a C-terminal propeptide. Their maturation involves enzymatic dehydration of Ser and Thr residues in the precursor peptide to generate unsaturated amino acids, which react intramolecularly with nearby cysteines to form cyclic thioethers termed lanthionines and methyllanthionines. The role of the leader peptide in lantibiotic biosynthesis has been subject to much speculation. In this study, mutations of conserved residues in the leader sequence of the precursor peptide for lacticin 481 (LctA) did not inhibit dehydration and cyclization by lacticin 481 synthetase (LctM) showing that not one specific residue is essential for these transformations. These amino acids may therefore be conserved in the leader sequence of class II lantibiotics to direct other biosynthetic events, such as proteolysis of the leader peptide or transport of the active compound outside the cell. However, introduction of Pro residues into the leader peptide strongly affected the efficiency of dehydration, consistent with recognition of the secondary structure of the leader peptide by the synthetase. Furthermore, the presence of a hydrophobic residue at the position of Leu-7 appears important for enzymatic processing. Based on the data in this work and previous studies, a model for the interaction of LctM with LctA is proposed. The current study also showcases the ability to prepare other lantibiotics in the class II lacticin 481 family, including nukacin ISK-1, mutacin II, and ruminococcin A using the lacticin 481 synthetase. Surprisingly, a conserved Glu located in a ring that appears conserved in many class II lantibiotics, including those not belonging to the lacticin 481 subgroup, is not essential for antimicrobial activity of lacticin 481.",

Microcystis blooms are often toxic, potentially fatal to animals and humans, and may cause environmental problems. There has been little investigation of the genomics of these cyanobacteria.<h4>Results</h4>Deciphering the 5,172,804 bp sequence of Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 has revealed the high plasticity of its genome: 11.7% DNA repeats containing more than 1,000 bases, 6.8% putative transposases and 21 putative restriction enzymes. Compared to the genomes of other cyanobacterial lineages, strain PCC 7806 contains a large number of atypical genes that may have been acquired by lateral transfers. Metabolic pathways, such as fermentation and a methionine salvage pathway, have been identified, as have genes for programmed cell death that may be related to the rapid disappearance of Microcystis blooms in nature. Analysis of the PCC 7806 genome also reveals striking novel biosynthetic features that might help to elucidate the ecological impact of secondary metabolites and lead to the discovery of novel metabolites for new biotechnological applications. M. aeruginosa and other large cyanobacterial genomes exhibit a rapid loss of synteny in contrast to other microbial genomes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 appears to have adopted an evolutionary strategy relying on unusual genome plasticity to adapt to eutrophic freshwater ecosystems, a property shared by another strain of M. aeruginosa (NIES-843). Comparisons of the genomes of PCC 7806 and other cyanobacterial strains indicate that a similar strategy may have also been used by the marine strain Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501 to adapt to other ecological niches, such as oligotrophic open oceans.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Summary</h4>ATP-binding cassette (ABC) systems are universally distributed among living organisms and function in many different aspects of bacterial physiology. ABC transporters are best known for their role in the import of essential nutrients and the export of toxic molecules, but they can also mediate the transport of many other physiological substrates. In a classical transport reaction, two highly conserved ATP-binding domains or subunits couple the binding/hydrolysis of ATP to the translocation of particular substrates across the membrane, through interactions with membrane-spanning domains of the transporter. Variations on this basic theme involve soluble ABC ATP-binding proteins that couple ATP hydrolysis to nontransport processes, such as DNA repair and gene expression regulation. Insights into the structure, function, and mechanism of action of bacterial ABC proteins are reported, based on phylogenetic comparisons as well as classic biochemical and genetic approaches. The availability of an increasing number of high-resolution structures has provided a valuable framework for interpretation of recent studies, and realistic models have been proposed to explain how these fascinating molecular machines use complex dynamic processes to fulfill their numerous biological functions. These advances are also important for elucidating the mechanism of action of eukaryotic ABC proteins, because functional defects in many of them are responsible for severe human inherited diseases.",

The self-resistance mechanism to these toxic metabolites in the producing plants, however, remains unclear. The plant-derived anticancer alkaloid camptothecin (CPT) induces cell death by targeting DNA topoisomerase I (Top1), the enzyme that catalyzes changes in DNA topology. We found that CPT-producing plants, including Camptotheca acuminata, Ophiorrhiza pumila, and Ophiorrhiza liukiuensis, have Top1s with point mutations that confer resistance to CPT, suggesting the effect of an endogenous toxic metabolite on the evolution of the target cellular component. Three amino acid substitutions that contribute to CPT resistance were identified: Asn421Lys, Leu530Ile, and Asn722Ser (numbered according to human Top1). The substitution at position 722 is identical to that found in CPT-resistant human cancer cells. The other mutations have not been found to date in CPT-resistant human cancer cells; this predicts the possibility of occurrence of these mutations in CPT-resistant human cancer patients in the future. Furthermore, comparative analysis of Top1s of CPT-producing and nonproducing plants suggested that the former were partially primed for CPT resistance before CPT biosynthesis evolved. Our results demonstrate the molecular mechanism of self-resistance to endogenously produced toxic compounds and the possibility of adaptive coevolution between the CPT production system and its target Top1 in the producing plants.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Polyacetylenic natural products are a substantial class of often unstable compounds containing a unique carbon-carbon triple bond functionality, that are intriguing for their wide variety of biochemical and ecological functions, economic potential, and surprising mode of biosynthesis. Isotopic tracer experiments between 1960 and 1990 demonstrated that the majority of these compounds are derived from fatty acid and polyketide precursors. During the past decade, research into the metabolism of polyacetylenes has swiftly advanced, driven by the cloning of the first genes responsible for polyacetylene biosynthesis in plants, moss, fungi, and actinomycetes and the initial characterization of the gene products. The current state of knowledge of the biochemistry and molecular genetics of polyacetylenic secondary metabolic pathways will be presented together with an up-to-date survey of new terrestrial and marine natural products, their known biological activities, and a discussion of their likely metabolic origins.",

To identify mouse thyroid epitopes recognized by destructive, hTg-primed T cells, we selected the three hTg epitopes known to be presented by H2E(b), as the basis for synthesizing potential mTg epitopes. One 15-mer peptide, mTg409, did prime T cells, elicit Ab, and induce thyroiditis. Moreover, cells primed with corresponding, pathogenic hTg410 cross-reacted with mTg409, and vice versa. mTg409 contained 4/4 anchor residues, similar to the corresponding hTg peptide. Based on this finding, a second mTg epitope, mTg179, was subsequently identified. These mTg autoepitopes, identified by using thyroiditogenic hTg epitopes, help to explain the severe thyroiditis seen in this novel A-E+ transgenic model.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Streptomyces davawensis synthesizes the antibiotic roseoflavin, one of the few known natural riboflavin analogs, and is roseoflavin resistant. It is thought that the endogenous flavokinase (EC 2.7.1.26)/flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) synthetase (EC 2.7.7.2) activities of roseoflavin-sensitive organisms are responsible for the antibiotic effect of roseoflavin, producing the inactive cofactors roseoflavin-5'-monophosphate (RoFMN) and roseoflavin adenine dinucleotide (RoFAD) from roseoflavin. To confirm this, the FAD-dependent Sus scrofa D-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3) was tested with RoFAD as a cofactor and found to be inactive. It was hypothesized that a flavokinase/FAD synthetase (RibC) highly specific for riboflavin may be present in S. davawensis, which would not allow the formation of toxic RoFMN/RoFAD. The gene ribC from S. davawensis was cloned. RibC from S. davawensis was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified. Analysis of the flavokinase activity of RibC revealed that the S. davawensis enzyme is not riboflavin specific (roseoflavin, kcat/Km = 1.7 10(-2) microM(-1) s(-1); riboflavin, kcat/Km = 7.5 10(-3) microM(-1) s(-1)). Similar results were obtained for RibC from the roseoflavin-sensitive bacterium Bacillus subtilis (roseoflavin, kcat/Km = 1.3 10(-2) microM(-1) s(-1); riboflavin, kcat/Km = 1.3 10(-2) microM(-1) s(-1)). Both RibC enzymes synthesized RoFAD and RoFMN. The functional expression of S. davawensis ribC did not confer roseoflavin resistance to a ribC-defective B. subtilis strain.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The antibiotic kijanimicin produced by the actinomycete Actinomadura kijaniata has a broad spectrum of bioactivities as well as a number of interesting biosynthetic features. To understand the molecular basis for its formation and to develop a combinatorial biosynthetic system for this class of compounds, a 107.6 kb segment of the A. kijaniata chromosome containing the kijanimicin biosynthetic locus was identified, cloned, and sequenced. The complete pathway for the formation of TDP-l-digitoxose, one of the two sugar donors used in construction of kijanimicin, was elucidated through biochemical analysis of four enzymes encoded in the gene cluster. Sequence analysis indicates that the aglycone kijanolide is formed by the combined action of a modular Type-I polyketide synthase, a conserved set of enzymes involved in formation, attachment, and intramolecular cyclization of a glycerate-derived three-carbon unit, which forms the core of the spirotetronate moiety. The genes involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual deoxysugar d-kijanose [2,3,4,6-tetradeoxy-4-(methylcarbamyl)-3-C-methyl-3-nitro-d-xylo-hexopyranose], including one encoding a flavoenzyme predicted to catalyze the formation of the nitro group, have also been identified. This work has implications for the biosynthesis of other spirotetronate antibiotics and nitrosugar-bearing natural products, as well as for future mechanistic and biosynthetic engineering efforts.",

The two Nostoc proteins fold as highly symmetric right-handed quadrilateral beta-helices similar to the mycobacterial protein MfpA implicated in fluoroquinolone resistance and DNA gyrase inhibition.

The advanced intermediate pentalenolactone F, along with the shunt metabolite pentalenic acid, could be isolated from cultures of S. avermitilis, thereby establishing that the pentalenolactone biosynthetic pathway is functional in S. avermitilis. Deletion of the entire 13.4 kb cluster from S. avermitilis abolished formation of pentalenolactone metabolites, while transfer of the intact cluster to the pentalenolactone nonproducer Streptomyces lividans 1326 resulted in production of pentalenic acid. Direct evidence for the biochemical function of the individual biosynthetic genes came from expression of the ptlA gene (SAV2998) in Escherichia coli. Assay of the resultant protein established that PtlA is a pentalenene synthase, catalyzing the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to pentalenene, the parent hydrocarbon of the pentalenolactone family of metabolites. The most upstream gene in the cluster, gap1 (SAV2990), was shown to correspond to the pentalenolactone resistance gene, based on expression in E. coli and demonstration that the resulting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the normal target of pentalenolactone, was insensitive to the antibiotic. Furthermore, a second GAPDH isozyme (gap2, SAV6296) has been expressed in E. coli and shown to be inactivated by pentalenolactone.",

        "pmc_abstract": "I investigated the significance of the intracellular accumulation of guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate (ppGpp) and of the coordinated decrease in the GTP pool for initiating morphological and physiological differentiation of Streptomyces griseus, a streptomycin-producing strain. In solid cultures, aerial mycelium formation was severely suppressed by the presence of excess nutrients. However, decoyinine, a specific inhibitor of GMP synthetase, enabled the cells to develop aerial mycelia in the suppressed cultures at concentrations which only partially inhibited growth. A factor (2S-isocapryloyl-3S-hydroxymethyl-gamma-butyrolactone) added exogenously had no such effect. Decoyinine was also effective in initiating the formation of submerged spores in liquid culture. The ability to produce streptomycin did not increase but decreased drastically on the addition of decoyinine. This sharp decrease in streptomycin production was accompanied by a decrease in intracellular accumulation of ppGpp. A relaxed (rel) mutant was found among 25 thiopeptin-resistant isolates which developed spontaneously. The rel mutant had a severely reduced ability to accumulate ppGpp during a nutritional shift-down and also during postexponential growth and showed a less extensive decrease in the GTP pool than that in the rel+ parental strain. The rel mutant failed to induce the enzymes amidinotransferase and streptomycin kinase, which are essential for the biosynthesis of streptomycin. The abilities to form aerial mycelia and submerged spores were still retained, but the amounts were less, and for both the onset of development was markedly delayed. The decreased ability to produced submerged spores was largely restored by the addition of decoyinine. This was accompanied by an extensive GTP pool decrease. The rel mutant produced A factor normally, indicating that synthesis of A factor is controlled neither by ppGpp nor by GTP. Conversely, a mutant defective in A-factor synthesis accumulated as much ppGpp as did the parental strain. It was concluded that morphological differentiation of S. griseus results from a decrease in the pool of GTP, whereas physiological differentiation results from a more direct function of the rel gene product (ppGpp). It is also suggested that A factor may render the cell sensitive to receive and respond to the specified signal molecules, presumably ppGpp (for physiological differentiation) or GTP (for morphological differentiation).",

        "pmc_abstract": "Two tetracycline resistance genes of Streptomyces rimosus, an oxytetracycline producer, were cloned in Streptomyces griseus by using pOA15 as a vector plasmid. Expression of the cloned genes, designated as tetA and tetB was inducible in S. griseus as well as in the donor strain. The tetracycline resistance directed by tetA and tetB was characterized by examining the uptake of tetracycline and in vitro polyphenylalanine synthesis by the sensitive host and transformants with the resultant hybrid plasmids. Polyphenylalanine synthesis with crude ribosomes and the S150 fraction from S. griseus carrying the tetA plasmid was resistant to tetracycline, and, by a cross-test of ribosomes and S150 fraction coming from both the sensitive host and the resistant transformant, the resistance directed by tetA was revealed to reside mainly in crude ribosomes and slightly in the S150 fraction. However, the resistance in the crude ribosomes disappeared when they were washed with 1 M ammonium chloride. These results suggest that tetA specified the tetracycline resistance of the machinery for protein synthesis not through ribosomal subunits, but via an unidentified cytoplasmic factor. In contrast, S. griseus carrying the tetB plasmid accumulated less intracellular tetracycline than did the host, and the protein synthesis by reconstituting the ribosomes and S150 fraction was sensitive to the drug. Therefore, it is conceivable that tetB coded a tetracycline resistance determinant responsible for the reduced accumulation of tetracycline.",

Actinobacteria also possess 20S proteasome machinery, raising the question of self-resistance. We identified a redundant proteasome Î²-subunit, SalI, encoded within the salinosporamide biosynthetic gene cluster and biochemically characterized the SalI proteasome complex. The SalI Î²-subunit has an altered substrate specificity profile, 30-fold resistance to salinosporamide A, and cross-resistance to the FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Many secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi have potent biological activities, to which the producer organism must be resistant. An example of pharmaceutical interest is mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressant molecule produced by several Penicillium species. The target of MPA is inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which catalyses the rate limiting step in the synthesis of guanine nucleotides. The recent discovery of the MPA biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium brevicompactum revealed an extra copy of the IMPDH-encoding gene (mpaF) embedded within the cluster. This finding suggests that the key component of MPA self resistance is likely based on the IMPDH encoded by mpaF.<h4>Results</h4>In accordance with our hypothesis, heterologous expression of mpaF dramatically increased MPA resistance in a model fungus, Aspergillus nidulans, which does not produce MPA. The growth of an A. nidulans strain expressing mpaF was only marginally affected by MPA at concentrations as high as 200 Î¼g/ml. To further substantiate the role of mpaF in MPA resistance, we searched for mpaF orthologs in six MPA producer/non-producer strains from Penicillium subgenus Penicillium. All six strains were found to hold two copies of IMPDH. A cladistic analysis based on the corresponding cDNA sequences revealed a novel group constituting mpaF homologs. Interestingly, a conserved tyrosine residue in the original class of IMPDHs is replaced by a phenylalanine residue in the new IMPDH class.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We identified a novel variant of the IMPDH-encoding gene in six different strains from Penicillium subgenus Penicillium. The novel IMPDH variant from MPA producer P. brevicompactum was shown to confer a high degree of MPA resistance when expressed in a non-producer fungus. Our study provides a basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of MPA resistance and has relevance for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The phenazines are redox-active secondary metabolites that a large number of bacterial strains produce and excrete into the environment. They possess antibiotic activity owing to the fact that they can reduce molecular oxygen to toxic reactive oxygen species. In order to take advantage of this activity, phenazine producers need to protect themselves against phenazine toxicity. Whereas it is believed that phenazine-producing pseudomonads possess highly active superoxide dismutases and catalases, it has recently been found that the plant-colonizing bacterium Enterobacter agglomerans expresses a small gene ehpR to render itself resistant towards D-alanyl-griseoluteic acid, the phenazine antibiotic produced by this strain.<h4>Results</h4>To understand the resistance mechanism installed by EhpR we have determined its crystal structure in the apo form at 2.15 Ã resolution and in complex with griseoluteic acid at 1.01 Ã, respectively. While EhpR shares a common fold with glyoxalase-I/bleomycin resistance proteins, the ligand binding site does not contain residues that some related proteins employ to chemically alter their substrates. Binding of the antibiotic is mediated by Ï-stacking interactions of the aromatic moiety with the side chains of aromatic amino acids and by a few polar interactions. The dissociation constant KD between EhpR and griseoluteic acid was quantified as 244 Â± 45 Î¼M by microscale thermophoresis measurements.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The data accumulated here suggest that EhpR confers resistance by binding D-alanyl-griseoluteic acid and acting as a chaperone involved in exporting the antibiotic rather than by altering it chemically. It is tempting to speculate that EhpR acts in concert with EhpJ, a transport protein of the major facilitator superfamily that is also encoded in the phenazine biosynthesis operon of E. agglomerans. The low affinity of EhpR for griseoluteic acid may be required for its physiological function.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are characterized by the thioether cross-linked amino acids lanthionine (Lan) and methyllanthionine (MeLan). Cinnamycin is a 19 amino acid lantibiotic that contains one Lan and two MeLan. Cinnamycin also contains an unusual lysinoalanine (Lal) bridge formed from the Îµ-amino group of lysine 19 and a serine residue at position 6, and an erythro-3-hydroxy-L-aspartic acid resulting from the hydroxylation of L-aspartate at position 15. These modifications are critical in mediating the interactions of cinnamycin with its target, phosphatidylethanolamine. Recently, the cinnamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (cin) from Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus DSM 40005 was reported. Herein, we investigated the biosynthetic machinery using both in vitro studies and heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. CinX is an Î±-ketoglutarate/iron(II)-dependent hydroxylase that carries out the hydroxylation of aspartate 15 of the precursor peptide CinA. In addition, CinM catalyzes dehydration of four Ser and Thr residues and subsequent cyclization of Cys residues to form the three (Me)Lan bridges. The order of the post-translational modifications catalyzed by CinM and CinX is interchangeable in vitro. CinX did not require the leader sequence at the N-terminus of CinA for activity, but the leader peptide was necessary for CinM function. Although CinM dehydrated serine 6, it did not catalyze the formation of Lal. A small protein encoded by cinorf7 is critical for the formation of the cross-link between Lys19 and dehydroalanine 6 as shown by coexpression studies of CinA, CinM, CinX, and Cinorf7 in E. coli.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Zwittermicin A (ZmA) is a hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide produced by certain Bacillus cereus group strains. It displays broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Its biosynthetic pathway in B. cereus has been proposed through analysis of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) modules involved in ZmA biosynthesis. In this study, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain YBT-1520 genomic DNA. The presence of known genes involved in the biosynthesis of ZmA in this BAC library was investigated by PCR techniques. Nine positive clones were identified, two of which (covering an approximately 60-kb region) could confer ZmA biosynthesis ability upon B. thuringiensis BMB171 after simultaneous transfer into this host by two compatible shuttle BAC vectors. Another previously unidentified gene cluster, named zmaWXY, was found to improve the yield of ZmA and was experimentally defined to function as a ZmA resistance transporter which expels ZmA from the cells. Putative transposase genes were detected on the flanking regions of the two gene clusters (the ZmA synthetic cluster and zmaWXY), which suggests a mobile nature of these two gene clusters. The intact ZmA gene cluster was validated, and a resistance mechanism complementary to that for zmaR (the previously identified ZmA self-resistance gene) was revealed. This study also provided a straightforward strategy to isolate and identify a huge gene cluster from Bacillus.",

Amycolatopsis balhimycina produces the vancomycin-like glycopeptide balhimycin and therefore has to protect itself from the action of the glycopeptide. We studied the roles of the accessory resistance gene orthologs vanY(b), vnlR(b), and vnlS(b), which are part of the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster (represented by the subscript \"b\"). The VanY(b) carboxypeptidase cleaved the terminal d-Ala from peptidoglycan precursors, and its heterologous expression enhanced glycopeptide resistance in Streptomyces coelicolor. The VanRS-like two component system VnlRS(b) was not involved in glycopeptide resistance or in the expression of the vanHAX glycopeptide resistance genes. Mature A. balhimycina peptidoglycan contained mainly tri- and tetrapeptides, with only traces of the d-Ala-d-Ala-ending pentapeptides that are binding sites for the antibiotic produced. The structure of the peptidoglycan precursor is consistent with the presence of vanHAX genes, which were identified outside the balhimycin synthesis cluster. Both wild-type and non-antibiotic-producing mutant strains synthesized peptidoglycan precursors ending mainly with d-Lac, indicating constitutive synthesis of a resistant cell wall. A. balhimycina could provide a model for an ancestral glycopeptide producer with constitutively expressed resistance genes.",

        "pmc_abstract": "In Firmicutes bacteria, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters have been recognized as important resistance determinants against antimicrobial peptides. Together with neighboring two-component systems (TCSs), which regulate their expression, they form specific detoxification modules. Both the transport permease and sensor kinase components show unusual domain architecture: the permeases contain a large extracellular domain, while the sensor kinases lack an obvious input domain. One of the best-characterized examples is the bacitracin resistance module BceRS-BceAB of Bacillus subtilis. Strikingly, in this system, the ABC transporter and TCS have an absolute mutual requirement for each other in both sensing of and resistance to bacitracin, suggesting a novel mode of signal transduction in which the transporter constitutes the actual sensor. We identified over 250 such BceAB-like ABC transporters in the current databases. They occurred almost exclusively in Firmicutes bacteria, and 80% of the transporters were associated with a BceRS-like TCS. Phylogenetic analyses of the permease and sensor kinase components revealed a tight evolutionary correlation. Our findings suggest a direct regulatory interaction between the ABC transporters and TCSs, mediating communication between both components. Based on their observed coclustering and conservation of response regulator binding sites, we could identify putative corresponding two-component systems for transporters lacking a regulatory system in their immediate neighborhood. Taken together, our results show that these types of ABC transporters and TCSs have coevolved to form self-sufficient detoxification modules against antimicrobial peptides, widely distributed among Firmicutes bacteria.",

This antibiotic also inhibits the incorporation of N-acetylglucosamine into the peptidoglycan of S. aureus at a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 0.7 Î¼M, which is proportional to its MIC (0.87 Î¼M; equivalent to 1.0 Î¼g/ml). Treatment of exponential-phase S. aureus cells with TPPC resulted in accumulation of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide in the cytoplasm. The antimicrobial activity of TPPC was weakened by the addition of prenyl pyrophosphates but not by prenyl phosphates, UDP-linked sugars, or the pentapeptide of peptidoglycan. The direct interaction between TPPC and undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C(55)-PP) was observed by mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography analysis, indicating that TPPC can potentially inhibit C(55)-PP phosphatase activity, which plays a crucial role in the lipid cycle of peptidoglycan synthesis. As expected, TPPC inhibits this enzymatic reaction at an IC(50) of 0.03 to 0.1 Î¼M in vitro, as does bacitracin. From the analysis of accumulation of lipid carrier-related compounds, TPPC was found to cause the accumulation of C(55)-PP in situ, leading to the accumulation of a glycine-containing lipid intermediate. This suggested that the TPPC/C(55)-PP complex also inhibits the transglycosylation step or flippase activity, adding to the inhibition of C(55)-PP dephosphorylation. This mode of action is different from that of currently available drugs such as vancomycin, daptomycin, and bacitracin.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Doxorubicin, one of the most widely used anticancer drugs, is composed of a tetracyclic polyketide aglycone and l-daunosamine as a deoxysugar moiety, which acts as an important determinant of its biological activity. This is exemplified by the fewer side effects of semisynthetic epirubicin (4'-epi-doxorubicin). An efficient combinatorial biosynthetic system that can convert the exogenous aglycone Îµ-rhodomycinone into diverse glycosylated derivatives of doxorubicin or its biosynthetic intermediates, rhodomycin D and daunorubicin, was developed through the use of Streptomyces venezuelae mutants carrying plasmids that direct the biosynthesis of different nucleotide deoxysugars and their transfer onto aglycone, as well as the postglycosylation modifications. This system improved epirubicin production from Îµ-rhodomycinone by selecting a substrate flexible glycosyltransferase, AknS, which was able to transfer the unnatural sugar donors and a TDP-4-ketohexose reductase, AvrE, which efficiently supported the biosynthesis of TDP-4-epi-l-daunosamine. Furthermore, a range of doxorubicin analogs containing diverse deoxysugar moieties, seven of which are novel rhodomycin D derivatives, were generated. This provides new insights into the functions of deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes and demonstrates the potential of the S. venezuelae-based combinatorial biosynthetic system as a simple biological tool for modifying structurally complex sugar moieties attached to anthracyclines as an alternative to chemical syntheses for improving anticancer agents.",

Here we show that the intramolecular disulfide bridge is constructed from the acyclic ene-dithiol at a late stage in the pathway by a thioredoxin oxidoreductase-like enzyme HlmI from the holomycin producer Streptomyces clavuligerus. Recombinant HlmI was purified from E. coli with bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and converts reduced holomycin to holomycin utilizing O(2) as cosubstrate. As a dithiol oxidase, HlmI is functionally homologous to GliT and DepH, which perform a similar dithiol to disulfide oxidation in the biosynthesis of fungal natural product gliotoxin and epigenetic regulator compound FK228, respectively. Deletion of the hlmI gene in the wild type S. clavuligerus and in a holomycin-overproducing mutant resulted in decreased level of holomycin production and increased sensitivity toward holomycin, suggesting a self-protection role of HlmI in the holomycin biosynthetic pathway. HlmI belongs to a new clade of uncharacterized thioredoxin oxidoreductase-like enzymes, distinctive from the GliT-like enzymes and the DepH-like enzymes, and represents a third example of oxidoreductases that catalyzes disulfide formation in the biosynthesis of small molecules.",

Sequence analysis of a 42.5-kb DNA region revealed 26 putative open reading frames, including two nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes and a polyketide synthase gene. A special feature is the presence of a polyketide synthase-type ketoreductase domain embedded in an NRPS. Furthermore, we showed that PyrA functioned as an NRPS adenylation domain that activates 3-hydroxypicolinic acid and transfers it to a discrete peptidyl carrier protein, PyrU, which functions as a loading module that initiates pyridomycin biosynthesis in vivo and in vitro. PyrA could also activate other aromatic acids, generating three pyridomycin analogues in vivo.",

SimR belongs to the TetR family of bacterial transcriptional regulators. In the absence of the antibiotic simocyclinone, SimR represses the transcription of a divergently transcribed gene encoding the simocyclinone efflux pump SimX in Streptomyces antibioticus by binding to operators inÂ the simR-simX intergenic region. Simocyclinone binding causes SimR to dissociate from its operators, leading to expression of the SimX efflux pump. Thus, SimR represents an intimate link between the biosynthesis of simocyclinone and its export, which may also provide the mechanism of self-resistance to the antibiotic in the producer strain.",

The regulation of FASII by extracellular fatty acids was examined in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, representing two important groups of pathogens. Both bacteria use the same enzymatic tool kit for the conversion of extracellular fatty acids to acyl-acyl carrier protein, elongation, and incorporation into phospholipids. Exogenous fatty acids completely replace the endogenous fatty acids in S. pneumoniae but support only 50% of phospholipid synthesis in S. aureus. Fatty acids overcame FASII inhibition in S. pneumoniae but not in S. aureus. Extracellular fatty acids strongly suppress malonyl-CoA levels in S. pneumoniae but not in S. aureus, showing a feedback regulatory system in S. pneumoniae that is absent in S. aureus. Fatty acids overcame either a biochemical or a genetic block at acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in S. aureus, confirming that regulation at the ACC step is the key difference between these two species. Bacteria that possess a stringent biochemical feedback inhibition of ACC and malonyl-CoA formation triggered by environmental fatty acids are able to circumvent FASII inhibition.

        "pmc_abstract": "Lipopeptide biosurfactants (LPBSs) consist of a hydrophobic fatty acid portion linked to a hydrophilic peptide chain in the molecule. With their complex and diverse structures, LPBSs exhibit various biological activities including surface activity as well as anti-cellular and anti-enzymatic activities. LPBSs are also involved in multi-cellular behaviors such as swarming motility and biofilm formation. Among the bacterial genera, Bacillus (Gram-positive) and Pseudomonas (Gram-negative) have received the most attention because they produce a wide range of effective LPBSs that are potentially useful for agricultural, chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries. The biosynthetic mechanisms and gene regulation systems of LPBSs have been extensively analyzed over the last decade. LPBSs are generally synthesized in a ribosome-independent manner with megaenzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Production of active-form NRPSs requires not only transcriptional induction and translation but also post-translational modification and assemblage. The accumulated knowledge reveals the versatility and evolutionary lineage of the NRPSs system. This review provides an overview of the structural and functional diversity of LPBSs and their different biosynthetic mechanisms in Bacillus and Pseudomonas, including both typical and unique systems. Finally, successful genetic engineering of NRPSs for creating novel lipopeptides is also discussed.",

The recently discovered lantibiotic epilancin 15X produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis 15X154 contains an unusual N-terminal lactate group. To understand its biosynthesis, the epilancin 15X biosynthetic gene cluster was identified. The N-terminal lactate is produced by dehydration of a serine residue in the first position of the core peptide by ElxB, followed by proteolytic removal of the leader peptide by ElxP and hydrolysis of the resulting new N-terminal dehydroalanine. The pyruvate group thus formed is reduced to lactate by an NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase designated ElxO. The enzymatic activity of ElxB, ElxP, and ElxO were investigated inÂ vitro or inÂ vivo and the importance of the N-terminal modification for peptide stability against bacterial aminopeptidases was assessed.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Proteomics was recently used to reveal enzymes whose expression is associated with the production of the glycopeptide antibiotic balhimycin in Amycolatopsis balhimycina batch cultivations. Combining chemostat fermentation technology, where cells proliferate with constant parameters in a highly reproducible steady-state, and differential proteomics, the relationships between physiological status and metabolic pathways during antibiotic producing and non-producing conditions could be highlighted.<h4>Results</h4>Two minimal defined media, one with low Pi (0.6 mM; LP) and proficient glucose (12 g/l) concentrations and the other one with high Pi (1.8 mM) and limiting (6 g/l; LG) glucose concentrations, were developed to promote and repress antibiotic production, respectively, in A. balhimycina chemostat cultivations. Applying the same dilution rate (0.03 h-1), both LG and LP chemostat cultivations showed a stable steady-state where biomass production yield coefficients, calculated on glucose consumption, were 0.38 Â± 0.02 and 0.33 Â± 0.02 g/g (biomass dry weight/glucose), respectively. Notably, balhimycin was detected only in LP, where quantitative RT-PCR revealed upregulation of selected bal genes, devoted to balhimycin biosynthesis, and of phoP, phoR, pstS and phoD, known to be associated to Pi limitation stress response. 2D-Differential Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) and protein identification, performed by mass spectrometry and computer-assisted 2 D reference-map http://www.unipa.it/ampuglia/Abal-proteome-maps matching, demonstrated a differential expression for proteins involved in many metabolic pathways or cellular processes, including central carbon and phosphate metabolism. Interestingly, proteins playing a key role in generation of primary metabolism intermediates and cofactors required for balhimycin biosynthesis were upregulated in LP. Finally, a bioinformatic approach showed PHO box-like regulatory elements in the upstream regions of nine differentially expressed genes, among which two were tested by electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In the two chemostat conditions, used to generate biomass for proteomic analysis, mycelia grew with the same rate and with similar glucose-biomass conversion efficiencies. Global gene expression analysis revealed a differential metabolic adaptation, highlighting strategies for energetic supply and biosynthesis of metabolic intermediates required for biomass production and, in LP, for balhimycin biosynthesis. These data, confirming a relationship between primary metabolism and antibiotic production, could be used to increase antibiotic yield both by rational genetic engineering and fermentation processes improvement.",

Although structural differences between the analogues are minimal, comparison of the in vitro cytotoxicity of the series revealed a structure-activity relationship. When the ethyl substituent of 1 is changed to a methyl substituent in 2, activity is only slightly reduced (3-4-fold), whereas inversion of the Phe unit flanking the bis-thiazoline moiety results in 16-23-fold greater potency. We show that both 1 and 3 cause G1 phase cell cycle arrest at lower concentrations, followed at higher concentrations by G2/M phase arrest, and that these compounds bind Cu(2+) and Zn(2+). The three-dimensional structure of 2 was determined by MS, NMR, and X-ray crystallography, and the structure of 3 was established by MS, NMR, and chemical degradation. The structure of 3 was explored by in silico molecular modeling, revealing subtle differences in overall conformation between 1 and 3. Attempts to interconvert 1 and 3 with base were unsuccessful, but enzymatic conversion may be possible and could be a novel form of activation for chemical defense.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The redox-sensitive transcription factor SoxR in enteric bacteria senses and regulates the cellular response to superoxide and nitric oxide. In other bacterial groups, however, it may respond to redox-active small molecules, as demonstrated for pyocyanin sensing in pseudomonads. The antibiotic-producing soil bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor contains a gene for an SoxR homologue (SCO1697) whose DNA recognition helix is identical to that of Escherichia coli SoxR. Using the E. coli SoxR binding sequence, we predicted five candidate genes of the SoxR regulon and demonstrated that SoxR binds to their promoter regions and activates their expression concurrently with the production of the blue antibiotic actinorhodin (a benzoisochromanequinone). These genes encode a probable NADPH-dependent flavin reductase (SCO2478), an NADPH-dependent quinone reductase (SCO4266), an ABC transporter (SCO7008), a monooxygenase (SCO1909), and a hypothetical protein (SCO1178). Addition of actinorhodin to exponentially growing cells activated the expression of SoxR target genes in an SoxR-dependent manner. The secreted Î³-actinorhodin was over 10-fold more effective in activation than the intracellular form of actinorhodin, suggesting that SoxR is specified to respond more to exogenous signals than to intracellular metabolites. The ÎsoxR mutant was not compromised in resistance against oxidants but was slow in forming aerial mycelium on R2YE medium with reduced sporulation, and its production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin was lowered by about 50% and 30%, respectively, compared to that of the wild type. These results support the proposal that SoxR senses redox-active molecules, such as actinorhodin in S. coelicolor, and induces a protective function against them. It also functions to ensure that cells undergo optimal differentiation and secondary metabolite production.",

        "pmc_abstract": "QnrB1 is a plasmid-encoded pentapeptide repeat protein (PRP) that confers a moderate degree of resistance to fluoroquinolones. Its gene was cloned into an expression vector with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag, and the protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The structure of QnrB1 was determined by a combination of trypsinolysis, surface mutagenesis, and single anomalous dispersion phasing. QnrB1 folds as a right-handed quadrilateral Î²-helix with a highly asymmetric dimeric structure typical of PRP-topoisomerase poison resistance factors. The threading of pentapeptides into the Î²-helical fold is interrupted by two noncanonical PRP sequences that produce outward projecting loops that interrupt the regularity of the PRP surface. Deletion of the larger upper loop eliminated the protective effect of QnrB1 on DNA gyrase toward inhibition by quinolones, whereas deletion of the smaller lower loop drastically reduced the protective effect. These loops are conserved among all plasmid-based Qnr variants (QnrA, QnrC, QnrD, and QnrS) and some chromosomally encoded Qnr varieties. A mechanism in which PRP-topoisomerase poison resistance factors bind to and disrupt the quinolone-DNA-gyrase interaction is proposed.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The [2Fe-2S]-containing transcription factor SoxR is conserved in diverse bacteria. SoxR is traditionally known as the regulator of a global oxidative stress response in Escherichia coli, but recent studies suggest that this function may be restricted to enteric bacteria. In the vast majority of nonenterics, SoxR is predicted to mediate a response to endogenously produced redox-active metabolites. We have examined the regulation and function of the SoxR regulon in the model antibiotic-producing filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. Unlike the E. coli soxR deletion mutant, the S. coelicolor equivalent is not hypersensitive to oxidants, indicating that SoxR does not potentiate antioxidant defense in the latter. SoxR regulates five genes in S. coelicolor, including those encoding a putative ABC transporter, two oxidoreductases, a monooxygenase, and a possible NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase. Expression of these genes depends on the production of the benzochromanequinone antibiotic actinorhodin and requires intact [2Fe-2S] clusters in SoxR. These data indicate that actinorhodin, or a redox-active precursor, modulates SoxR activity in S. coelicolor to stimulate the production of a membrane transporter and proteins with homology to actinorhodin-tailoring enzymes. While the role of SoxR in S. coelicolor remains under investigation, these studies support the notion that SoxR has been adapted to perform distinct physiological functions to serve the needs of organisms that occupy different ecological niches and face different environmental challenges.",

The gene cluster was identified by mining a draft genome sequence using the predicted structural peptide sequence of TP-1161. Functional assignment of a â¼16-kb genomic region revealed 13 open reading frames proposed to constitute the TP-1161 biosynthetic locus. While the typical core set of thiopeptide modification enzymes contains one cyclodehydratase/dehydrogenase pair, paralogous genes predicted to encode additional cyclodehydratases and dehydrogenases were identified. Although attempts at heterologous expression of the TP-1161 gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor failed, its identity was confirmed through the targeted gene inactivation in the original host.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>SecDF is an accessory factor of the conserved Sec protein translocation machinery and belongs to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family of multidrug exporters. SecDF has been shown in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis to be involved in the export of proteins. RND proteins can mediate resistance against various substances and might be of relevance in antimicrobial therapy. The role of RND proteins in Staphylococcus aureus has not yet been determined.<h4>Results</h4>Markerless deletion mutants were constructed to analyze the impact of the so far uncharacterized RND proteins in S. aureus. While the lack of Sa2056 and Sa2339 caused no phenotype regarding growth and resistance, the secDF mutant resulted in a pleiotropic phenotype. The secDF mutant was cold sensitive, but grew normally in rich medium at 37Â°C. Resistance to beta-lactams, glycopeptides and the RND substrates acriflavine, ethidium bromide and sodium dodecyl sulfate was reduced. The secDF mutant showed an aberrant cell separation and increased spontaneous and Triton X-100 induced autolysis, although the amounts of penicillin-binding proteins in the membrane were unchanged. The impact of secDF deletion on transcription and expression of specific virulence determinants varied: While coagulase transcription and activity were reduced, the opposite was observed for the autolysin Atl. A reduction of the transcription of the cell wall anchored protein A (spa) was also found. The accumulation of SpA in the membrane and lowered amounts in the cell wall pointed to an impaired translocation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The combination of different effects of secDF deletion on transcription, regulation and translocation lead to impaired cell division, reduced resistance and altered expression of virulence determinants suggesting SecDF to be of major relevance in S. aureus. Thus SecDF could be a potential target for the control and eradication of S. aureus in the future.",

DesVII is unique among glycosyltransferases in that it requires an additional protein component, DesVIII, for activity. Characterization of the metabolites produced by a S. venezuelae mutant lacking the desVIII gene confirmed that desVIII is important for the biosynthesis of glycosylated macrolides but can be replaced by at least one of the homologous genes from other pathways. The addition of recombinant DesVIII protein significantly improves the glycosylation efficiency of DesVII in the in vitro assay. When affinity-tagged DesVII and DesVIII proteins were coproduced in Escherichia coli, they formed a tight (Î±Î²)(3) complex that is at least 10(3)-fold more active than DesVII alone. The formation of the DesVII/DesVIII complex requires coexpression of both genes in vivo and cannot be fully achieved by mixing the individual protein components in vitro. The ability of the DesVII/DesVIII system to catalyze the reverse reaction with the formation of TDP-desosamine was also demonstrated in a transglycosylation experiment. Taken together, our data suggest that DesVIII assists the folding of DesVII during protein production and remains tightly bound during catalysis. This requirement must be taken into consideration in the design of combinatorial biosynthetic experiments with new glycosylated macrolides.",

The biosynthetic gene cluster for microbisporicin, a potent lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Microbispora corallina containing chlorinated tryptophan and dihydroxyproline residues, was identified by genome scanning and isolated from an M. corallina cosmid library. Heterologous expression in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 confirmed that all of the genes required for microbisporicin biosynthesis were present in the cluster. Deletion, in M. corallina, of the gene (mibA) predicted to encode the prepropeptide abolished microbisporicin production. Further deletion analysis revealed insights into the biosynthesis of this unusual and potentially clinically useful lantibiotic, shedding light on mechanisms of regulation and self-resistance. In particular, we report an example of the involvement of a tryptophan halogenase in the modification of a ribosomally synthesized peptide and the pathway-specific regulation of an antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster by an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor-anti-sigma factor complex.",

Since strain NBRC14147 produces epsilon-PL-degrading enzymes, the original chain length of the epsilon-PL polymer product synthesized by epsilon-PL synthetase (Pls) is unclear. Here, we report on the identification of the gene encoding the epsilon-PL-degrading enzyme (PldII), which plays a central role in epsilon-PL degradation in this strain. A knockout mutant of the pldII gene was found to produce an epsilon-PL of unchanged polymer chain length, demonstrating that the length is not determined by epsilon-PL-degrading enzymes but rather by Pls itself and that the 25 to 35 L-lysine residues of epsilon-PL represent the original chain length of the polymer product synthesized by Pls in vivo. Transcriptional analysis of pls and a kinetic study of Pls further suggested that the Pls catalytic function is regulated by intracellular ATP, high levels of which are required for full enzymatic activity. Furthermore, it was found that acidic pH conditions during epsilon-PL fermentation, rather than the inhibition of the epsilon-PL-degrading enzyme, are necessary for the accumulation of intracellular ATP.",

These mature antibiotic scaffolds arise from a cascade of post-translational modifications on 50-60-residue prepeptide precursors that trim away the N-terminal leader sequences (approximately 40 residues) while the C-terminal 14-18 residues are converted into the mature scaffold. In the producing microbes, the genes encoding the prepeptide open reading frames are flanked in biosynthetic clusters by genes encoding post-translational modification enzymes that carry out lantibiotic-type dehydrations of Ser and Thr residues to dehydroamino acid side chains, cyclodehydration and oxidation of cysteines to thiazoles, and condensation of two dehydroalanine residues en route to the (tetrahydro)pyridine core. The trithiazolyl pyridine framework thus arises from post-translational modification of the peptide backbone of three Cys and two Ser residues of the prepeptide.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Sulfur is an essential element found ubiquitously in living systems. However, there exist only a few sulfur-containing sugars in nature and their biosyntheses have not been studied. BE-7585A produced by Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. vinearia BA-07585 has a 2-thiosugar and is a member of the angucycline class of compounds. We report herein the results of our initial efforts to study the biosynthesis of BE-7585A. Spectroscopic analyses verified the structure of BE-7585A, which is closely related to rhodonocardin A. Feeding experiments using (13)C-labeled acetate were carried out to confirm that the angucycline core is indeed polyketide-derived. The results indicated an unusual manner of angular tetracyclic ring construction, perhaps via a Baeyer-Villiger type rearrangement. Subsequent cloning and sequencing led to the identification of the bex gene cluster spanning approximately 30 kbp. A total of 28 open reading frames, which are likely involved in BE-7585A formation, were identified in the cluster. In view of the presence of a homologue of a thiazole synthase gene (thiG), bexX, in the bex cluster, the mechanism of sulfur incorporation into the 2-thiosugar moiety could resemble that found in thiamin biosynthesis. A glycosyltransferase homologue, BexG2, was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme successfully catalyzed the coupling of 2-thioglucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose to produce 2-thiotrehalose 6-phosphate, which is the precursor of the disaccharide unit in BE-7585A. On the basis of these genetic and biochemical experiments, a biosynthetic pathway for BE-7585A can now be proposed. The combined results set the stage for future biochemical studies of 2-thiosugar biosynthesis and BE-7585A assembly.",

In vitro activity of the modified compounds was determined against Mycobacterium spp. and representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Intracellular activity was evaluated in J774A.1 mouse macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv).<h4>Results</h4>Acylation of SQ997 and SQ641 with amino undecanoic acid (AUA) improved in vitro activity against most of the bacteria tested. Conjugation of SQ922 with DEC, but not AUA, improved its activity against Gram-positive bacteria. In the presence of efflux pump inhibitor phenylalanine arginine Î²-naphthyl amide, MICs of SQ997-AUA, SQ641-AUA and SQ922-DEC compounds improved even further against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In Gram-negative bacteria, EDTA-mediated permeabilization caused 4- to 16-fold enhancement of the activity of AUA-conjugated SQ997, SQ922 and SQ641. Conjugation of all three capuramycin analogues with AUA improved intracellular killing of H37Rv in murine macrophages.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Conjugation of capuramycin analogues with AUA or DEC enhanced in vitro activity, extended the spectrum of activity in Gram-positive bacteria and increased intracellular activity against H37Rv.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The thioesterase FlK from the fluoroacetate-producing Streptomyces cattleya catalyzes the hydrolysis of fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A. This provides an effective self-defense mechanism, preventing any fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A formed from being further metabolized to 4-hydroxy-trans-aconitate, a lethal inhibitor of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Remarkably, FlK does not accept acetyl-coenzyme A as a substrate. Crystal structure analysis shows that FlK forms a dimer, in which each subunit adopts a hot dog fold as observed for type II thioesterases. Unlike other type II thioesterases, which invariably utilize either an aspartate or a glutamate as catalytic base, we show by site-directed mutagenesis and crystallography that FlK employs a catalytic triad composed of Thr(42), His(76), and a water molecule, analogous to the Ser/Cys-His-acid triad of type I thioesterases. Structural comparison of FlK complexed with various substrate analogues suggests that the interaction between the fluorine of the substrate and the side chain of Arg(120) located opposite to the catalytic triad is essential for correct coordination of the substrate at the active site and therefore accounts for the substrate specificity.",

The crystal structure of APH(4)-Ia enzyme was solved in complex with hygB at 1.95 Ã resolution. The APH(4)-Ia structure adapts a general two-lobe architecture shared by other APH enzymes and eukaryotic kinases, with the active site located at the interdomain cavity. The enzyme forms an extended hydrogen bond network with hygB primarily through polar and acidic side chain groups. Individual alanine substitutions of seven residues involved in hygB binding did not have significant effect on APH(4)-Ia enzymatic activity, indicating that the binding affinity is spread across a distributed network. hygB appeared as the only substrate recognized by APH(4)-Ia among the panel of 14 aminoglycoside compounds. Analysis of the active site architecture and the interaction with the hygB molecule demonstrated several unique features supporting such restricted substrate specificity. Primarily the APH(4)-Ia substrate-binding site contains a cluster of hydrophobic residues that provides a complementary surface to the twisted structure of the substrate. Similar to APH(2â³) enzymes, the APH(4)-Ia is able to utilize either ATP or GTP for phosphoryl transfer. The defined structural features of APH(4)-Ia interactions with hygB and the promiscuity in regard to ATP or GTP binding could be exploited for the design of novel aminoglycoside antibiotics or inhibitors of this enzyme.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Lantibiotics are peptide-derived antibacterial substances produced by some Gram-positive bacteria and characterized by the presence of unusual amino acids, like lanthionines and dehydrated amino acids. Because lantibiotic producers may be attacked by self-produced lantibiotics, they express immunity proteins on the cytoplasmic membrane. An ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system mediated by the LanFEG protein complex is a major system in lantibiotic immunity. Multiple-sequence alignment analysis revealed that LanF proteins contain the E loop, a variant of the Q loop, which is a well-conserved motif in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of general ABC transporters. To elucidate E loop function, we introduced a mutation in the NukF protein, which is involved in the nukacin-ISK-1 immunity system. Amino acid replacement of glutamic acid in the E loop with glutamine (E85Q) resulted in slight decreases in the immunity level and transport activity. Additionally, the E85A mutation severely impaired the immunity level and transport activity. On the other hand, ATPase activities of purified E85Q and E85A mutants were almost similar to that of the wild type. These results suggested that the E loop found in ABC transporters involved in lantibiotic immunity plays a significant role in the function of these transporters, especially in the structural change of transmembrane domains.",

To identify genes necessary for biosynthesis of this unusual compound we screened a fosmid library of S. luridus for the presence of the phosphoenolpyruvate mutase gene, which is required for biosynthesis of most phosphonates. Integration of one such fosmid clone into the chromosome of S. lividans led to heterologous production of dehydrophos. Deletion analysis of this clone allowed identification of the minimal contiguous dehydrophos cluster, which contained 17 open reading frames (ORFs). Bioinformatic analyses of these ORFs are consistent with a proposed biosynthetic pathway that generates dehydrophos from phosphoenolpyruvate. The early steps of this pathway are supported by analysis of intermediates accumulated by blocked mutants and in vitro biochemical experiments.",

        "pmc_abstract": "In glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and staphylococci, high-level resistance is achieved by replacing the C-terminal d-alanyl-d-alanine of lipid II with d-alanyl-d-lactate, thus reducing glycopeptide affinity for cell wall targets. Reorganization of the cell wall in these organisms is directed by the vanHAX gene cluster. Similar self-resistance mechanisms have been reported for glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes. We investigated glycopeptide resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727, the producer of the glycopeptide A40926, which is the precursor of the semisynthetic antibiotic dalbavancin, which is currently in phase III clinical trials. The MIC of Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 toward A40926 during vegetative growth was 4 microg/ml, but this increased to ca. 20 microg/ml during A40926 production. vanHAX gene clusters were not detected in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 by Southern hybridization or by PCR with degenerate primers. However, the dbv gene cluster for A40926 production contains a gene, vanY (ORF7), potentially encoding an enzyme capable of removing the terminal d-Ala residue of pentapeptide peptidoglycan precursors. Analysis of UDP-linked peptidoglycan precursors in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 revealed the predominant presence of the tetrapeptide UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-meso-Dap-d-Ala and only traces of the pentapeptide UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-meso-Dap-d-Ala-d-Ala. This suggested a novel mechanism of glycopeptide resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 that was based on the d,d-carboxypeptidase activity of vanY. Consistent with this, a vanY-null mutant of Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 demonstrated a reduced level of glycopeptide resistance, without affecting A40926 productivity. Heterologous expression of vanY in a sensitive Streptomyces species, Streptomyces venezuelae, resulted in higher levels of glycopeptide resistance.",

Sequence analysis revealed a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster with a colinear domain organization, which is entirely consistent with the core structure of the tirandamycins. We also identified genes within the cluster that encode candidate tailoring enzymes for elaboration and modification of the bicyclic ketal system. Disruption of tamI, which encodes a presumed cytochrome P450, led to a mutant strain deficient in production of late stage tirandamycins that instead accumulated tirandamycin C, an intermediate devoid of any post assembly-line oxidative modifications.",

The enzymes that synthesize polyketides are collectively referred to as polyketide synthases (PKSs). Because many of the natural hosts that produce polyketides are difficult to culture or manipulate, establishing a universal heterologous host that is genetically tractable has become an important goal toward the engineered biosynthesis of polyketides and analogues. Here, we summarize the recent progresses in engineering Escherichia coli as a heterologous host for reconstituting PKSs of different types. Our increased understanding of PKS enzymology and structural biology, combined with new tools in protein engineering, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology, has firmly established E. coli as a powerful host for producing polyketides.",

However, only 23 and 22 ORFs showed striking similarities to the biosynthetic gene clusters for the bleomycins (BLMs) and tallysomycins (TLMs), respectively; the remaining ORFs do not show significant homology to ORFs from the related BLM and TLM clusters. The ZBM gene cluster consists of 16 nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes encoding eight complete NRPS modules, three incomplete didomain NRPS modules, and eight freestanding single NRPS domains or associated enzymes, a polyketide synthase (PKS) gene encoding one PKS module, six sugar biosynthesis genes, as well as genes encoding other biosynthesis and resistance proteins.

Like camptothecins, the indenoisoquinolines selectively trap Top1-DNA cleavage complexes and have been cocrystallized with the Top1-DNA cleavage complexes. Indenoisoquinolines show antitumor activity in animal models. They have several advantages over the camptothecins: (a) They are synthetic and chemically stable. (b) The Top1 cleavage sites trapped by the indenoisoquinolines have different genomic locations, implying differential targeting of cancer cell genomes. (c) The Top1 cleavage complexes trapped by indenoisoquinolines are more stable, indicative of prolonged drug action. (d) They are seldom or not used as substrates for the multidrug resistance efflux pumps (ABCG2 and MDR-1). Among the >400 indenoisoquinolines synthesized and evaluated, three have been retained as leads for clinical development by the National Cancer Institute: NSC 706744, NSC 725776 (Indimitecan), and NSC 724998 (Indotecan). The trapping of Top1 cleavage complexes by indenoisoquinolines in cells results in the rapid and sustained phosphorylation of histone H2AX (Î³-H2AX). We discuss the use of Î³-H2AX as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for the clinical development of the indenoisoquinolines.",

To investigate the structural basis for substrate recognition and catalysis, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of PtlH in several complexes with the cofactors iron, alpha-ketoglutarate, and the non-reactive enantiomer of the substrate, ent-1-deoxypentalenic acid, in four different crystal forms to up to 1.31 A resolution. The overall structure of PtlH forms a double-stranded barrel helix fold, and the cofactor-binding site for iron and alpha-ketoglutarate is similar to other double-stranded barrel helix fold enzymes. Additional secondary structure elements that contribute to the substrate-binding site in PtlH are not conserved in other double-stranded barrel helix fold enzymes. Binding of the substrate enantiomer induces a reorganization of the monoclinic crystal lattice leading to a disorder-order transition of a C-terminal alpha-helix. The newly formed helix blocks the major access to the active site and effectively traps the bound substrate. Kinetic analysis of wild type and site-directed mutant proteins confirms a critical function of two arginine residues in substrate binding, while simulated docking of the enzymatic reaction product reveals the likely orientation of bound substrate.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Zwittermicin A represents a new chemical class of antibiotic and has diverse biological activities, including suppression of oomycete diseases of plants and potentiation of the insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis. To identify genes involved in zwittermicin A production, we generated 4,800 transposon mutants of B. cereus UW101C and screened them for zwittermicin A accumulation. Nine mutants did not produce detectable zwittermicin A, and one mutant produced eightfold more than the parent strain. The DNA flanking the transposon insertions in six of the nine nonproducing mutants contains significant sequence similarity to genes involved in peptide and polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis. The mutant that overproduced zwittermicin A contained a transposon insertion immediately upstream from a gene that encodes a deduced protein that is a member of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators. Three genes identified by the mutant analysis mapped to a region that was previously shown to carry the zwittermicin A self-resistance gene, zmaR, and a biosynthetic gene (E. A. Stohl, J. L. Milner, and J. Handelsman, Gene 237:403-411, 1999). Further sequencing of this region revealed genes proposed to encode zwittermicin A precursor biosynthetic enzymes, in particular, those involved in the formation of the aminomalonyl- and hydroxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein intermediates. Additionally, nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) homologs are present, suggesting that zwittermicin A is synthesized by a mixed NRPS/PKS pathway.",

We used DNA microarrays and mutational analysis to investigate the expression of individual genes and multigene antibiotic biosynthetic pathways during these events. We identified expression patterns in biosynthetic, regulatory, and ribosomal protein genes that were associated highly specifically with particular stages of development. A knowledge-based algorithm that correlates temporal changes in expression with chromosomal position identified groups of contiguous genes expressed at discrete stages of morphological development, inferred the boundaries of known antibiotic synthesis gene loci, and revealed novel physical clusters of coordinately regulated genes. Microarray analysis of RNA from cells mutated in genes regulating synthesis of the antibiotics actinorhodin (Act) and undecylprodigiosin (Red) identified proximate and distant sites that contain putative ABC transporter and two-component system genes expressed coordinately with genes of specific biosynthetic pathways and indicated the existence of two functionally and physically discrete regulons in the Red pathway.",

A recently reported and novel function for bZIPs is association of these proteins with secondary metabolite production in filamentous fungi. In particular a Yap-like bZIP termed RsmA (restorer of secondary metabolism A) was identified in Aspergillus nidulans that positively regulates the carcinogen sterigmatocystin. To assess for conserved function for RsmA, we examined a role of this protein in secondary metabolism in the pathogen A. fumigatus. RsmA was found to positively regulate gliotoxin where overexpression (OE) of rsmA led to 2-100 fold increases of twelve gli cluster metabolites in culture medium including the newly identified gli metabolite cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser). Lungs from both wild type and OErsmA infected mice contained gliotoxin (2.3 fold higher in OErsmA treatment) as well as the gliotoxin precursor cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) (3.2 fold higher in OErsmA treatment). The data here presents a conserved role for RsmA in secondary metabolite cluster activation and suggests cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) may serve as an alternative marker for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Multidrug efflux pumps play an important role as a self-defense system in bacteria. Bacterial multidrug efflux pumps are classified into five families based on structure and coupling energy: resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND), small multidrug resistance (SMR), major facilitator (MF), ATP binding cassette (ABC), and multidrug and toxic compounds extrusion (MATE). We cloned a gene encoding a MATE-type multidrug efflux pump from Streptococcus pneumoniae R6, and designated it pdrM. PdrM showed sequence similarity with NorM from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, YdhE from Escherichia coli, and other bacterial MATE-type multidrug efflux pumps. Heterologous expression of PdrM let to elevated resistance to several antibacterial agents, norfloxacin, acriflavine, and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in E. coli KAM32 cells. PdrM effluxes acriflavine and DAPI in a Na(+)- or Li(+)-dependent manner. Moreover, Na(+) efflux via PdrM was observed when acriflavine was added to Na(+)-loaded cells expressing pdrM. Therefore, we conclude that PdrM is a Na(+)/drug antiporter in S. pneumoniae. In addition to pdrM, we found another two genes, spr1756 and spr1877,that met the criteria of MATE-type by searching the S. pneumoniae genome database. However, cloned spr1756 and spr1877 did not elevate the MIC of any of the investigated drugs. mRNA expression of spr1756, spr1877, and pdrM was detected in S. pneumoniae R6 under laboratory growth conditions. Therefore, spr1756 and spr1877 are supposed to play physiological roles in this growth condition, but they may be unrelated to drug resistance.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>VanYn, encoded by the dbv7 gene (also known as vanYn) of the biosynthetic cluster devoted to A40926 production, is a novel protein involved in the mechanism of self-resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727. This filamentous actinomycete is an uncommon microorganism, difficult-to-handle but biotechnologically valuable since it produces the glycopeptide antibiotic A40926, which is the precursor of the second-generation dalbavancin in phase III of clinical development. In order to investigate VanYn role in glycopeptide resistance in the producer actinomycete an appropriate host-vector expression system is required.<h4>Results</h4>The cloning strategy of vanYn gene (G-C ratio 73.3%) in the expression vector pIJ86 yielded a recombinant protein with a tag encoding for a histidine hexamer added at the C-terminus (C-His6-vanYn) or at the N-terminus (N-His6-vanYn). These plasmids were used to transform three Streptomyces spp., which are genetically-treatable high G-C content Gram-positive bacteria taxonomically related to the homologous producer Nonomuraea sp.. Highest yield of protein expression and purification (12 mg of protein per liter of culture at 3 L bioreactor-scale) was achieved in Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10595, that is a fast growing streptomyces susceptible to glycopeptides. VanYn is a transmembrane protein which was easily detached and recovered from the cell wall fraction. Purified C-His6-VanYn showed d,d-carboxypeptidase and d,d-dipeptidase activities on synthetic analogs of bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) precursors. C-His6-VanYn over-expression conferred glycopeptide resistance to S. venezuelae. On the contrary, the addition of His6-tag at the N-terminus of the protein abolished its biological activity either in vitro or in vivo assays.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Heterologous expression of vanYn from Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 in S. venezuelae was successfully achieved and conferred the host an increased level of glycopeptide resistance. Cellular localization of recombinant VanYn together with its enzymatic activity as a d,d-peptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase agree with its role in removing the last d-Ala from the pentapeptide PG precursors and reprogramming cell wall biosynthesis, as previously reported in glycopeptide resistant pathogens.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Camptothecin (CPT), a plant alkaloid originally isolated from the native Chinese tree, Camptotheca acuminate, exerts the toxic effect by targeting eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase 1 (DNA Topo1). Besides as potent anti-cancer agents, CPT and its derivatives are now being explored as potential pesticides for insect control. In this study, we assessed their toxicity to an insect homolog, the Topo1 protein from beet armyworms (Spodoptera exigua HÃ¼bner), a worldwide pest of many important crops. The S. exigua Topo1 gene contains an ORF of 2790 base pairs that is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 930 amino acids. The deduced polypeptide exhibits polymorphism at residue sites V420, L530, A653 and T729 (numbered according to human Topo1) among insect species, which are predicted to confer sensitivity to CPT. The DNA relaxation activity of this protein was subsequently examined using a truncated form that contained the residues 337-930 and was expressed in bacteria BL21 cells. The purified protein retained the ability to relax double-stranded DNA and was susceptible to CPT and its derivative hydroxy-camptothecin (HCPT) in a dose-dependent manner. The same inhibitory effect was also found on the native Topo1 extracted from IOZCAS-Spex-II cells, a cell line established from beet armyworms. Additionally, CPT and HCPT treatment reduced the steady accumulation of Topo1 protein despite the increased mRNA expression in response to the treatment. Our studies provide information of the S. exigua Topo1 gene and its amino acid polymorphism in insects and uncover some clues about potential mechanisms of CPT toxicity against insect pests. These results also are useful for development of more effective Topo1-targeted CPT insecticides in the future.",

In light of the significant potency against cancer, the biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported from many different Streptomyces strains, and the biosynthetic pathway were proposed mainly based on the in vivo feeding experiment with isotope labeled putative intermediates. Herein we report another gene cluster from Streptomyces griseovariabilis subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov responsible for the biosynthesis of echinomycin (a member of quinomycin family, also named quinomycin A) and presented in vitro evidence to corroborate the previous hypothesis on QXC biosynthesis, showing that only with the assistance of a MbtH-like protein Qui5, did the didomain NRPS protein (Qui18) perform the loading of a L-tryptophan onto its own PCP domain. Particularly, it was found that Qui5 and Qui18 subunits form a functional tetramer through size exclusion chromatography. The subsequent hydroxylation on Î²-carbon of the loaded L-tryptophan proved in vitro to be completed by cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylase Qui15. Importantly, only the Qui18 loaded L-tryptophan can be hydroxylated by Qui15 and the enzyme was inactive on free L-tryptophan. Additionally, the chemically synthesized (2S,3S) Î²-hydroxytryptophan was detected to be converted by the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase Qui17 through LC-MS, which enriched our previous knowledge that tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase nearly exclusively acted on L-tryptophan and 6-fluoro-tryptophan.",

To clarify the substrate specificity, in the present study we determined the crystal structure of DcsE at a 1.81-Ã resolution, showing that the overall structure of DcsE is similar to that of HAT, whereas a turn region to form an oxyanion hole is obviously different between DcsE and HAT: in detail, the first and last residues in the turn of DcsE are Gly(52) and Pro(55), respectively, but those of HAT are Ala and Gly, respectively. In addition, more water molecules were laid on one side of the turn region of DcsE than on that of HAT, and a robust hydrogen-bonding network was formed only in DcsE. We created a HAT-like mutant of DcsE in which Gly(52) and Pro(55) were replaced by Ala and Gly, respectively, showing that the mutant acetylates l-homoserine but scarcely acetylates l-serine. The crystal structure of the mutant DcsE shows that the active site, including the turn and its surrounding waters, is similar to that of HAT. These findings suggest that a methyl group of the first residue in the turn of HAT plays a role in excluding the binding of l-serine to the substrate-binding pocket. In contrast, the side chain of the last residue in the turn of DcsE may need to form an extensive hydrogen-bonding network on the turn, which interferes with the binding of l-homoserine.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Blasticidin S is a peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces griseochromogenes that exhibits strong fungicidal activity. To circumvent an effective DNA uptake barrier system in the native producer and investigate its biosynthesis in vivo, the blasticidin S biosynthetic gene cluster (bls) was engrafted to the chromosome of Streptomyces lividans. However, the resulting mutant, LL2, produced the inactive deaminohydroxyblasticidin S instead of blasticidin S. Subsequently, a blasticidin S deaminase (SLBSD, for S. lividans blasticidin S deaminase) was identified in S. lividans and shown to govern this in vivo conversion. Purified SLBSD was found to be capable of transforming blasticidin S to deaminohydroxyblasticidin S in vitro. It also catalyzed deamination of the cytosine moiety of cytosylglucuronic acid, an intermediate in blasticidin S biosynthesis. Disruption of the SLBSD gene in S. lividans LL2 led to successful production of active blasticidin S in the resultant mutant, S. lividans WJ2. To demonstrate the easy manipulation of the blasticidin S biosynthetic gene cluster, blsE, blsF, and blsL, encoding a predicted radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) protein, an unknown protein, and a guanidino methyltransferase, were individually inactivated to access their role in blasticidin S biosynthesis.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The heterologous production of complex natural products is an approach designed to address current limitations and future possibilities. It is particularly useful for those compounds which possess therapeutic value but cannot be sufficiently produced or would benefit from an improved form of production. The experimental procedures involved can be subdivided into three components: 1) genetic transfer; 2) heterologous reconstitution; and 3) product analysis. Each experimental component is under continual optimization to meet the challenges and anticipate the opportunities associated with this emerging approach. Heterologous biosynthesis begins with the identification of a genetic sequence responsible for a valuable natural product. Transferring this sequence to a heterologous host is complicated by the biosynthetic pathway complexity responsible for product formation. The antibiotic erythromycin A is a good example. Twenty genes (totaling >50 kb) are required for eventual biosynthesis. In addition, three of these genes encode megasynthases, multi-domain enzymes each ~300 kDa in size. This genetic material must be designed and transferred to E. coli for reconstituted biosynthesis. The use of PCR isolation, operon construction, multi-cystronic plasmids, and electro-transformation will be described in transferring the erythromycin A genetic cluster to E. coli. Once transferred, the E. coli cell must support eventual biosynthesis. This process is also challenging given the substantial differences between E. coli and most original hosts responsible for complex natural product formation. The cell must provide necessary substrates to support biosynthesis and coordinately express the transferred genetic cluster to produce active enzymes. In the case of erythromycin A, the E. coli cell had to be engineered to provide the two precursors (propionyl-CoA and (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA) required for biosynthesis. In addition, gene sequence modifications, plasmid copy number, chaperonin co-expression, post-translational enzymatic modification, and process temperature were also required to allow final erythromycin A formation. Finally, successful production must be assessed. For the erythromycin A case, we will present two methods. The first is liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to confirm and quantify production. The bioactivity of erythromycin A will also be confirmed through use of a bioassay in which the antibiotic activity is tested against Bacillus subtilis. The assessment assays establish erythromycin A biosynthesis from E. coli and set the stage for future engineering efforts to improve or diversify production and for the production of new complex natural compounds using this approach.",

The intrinsic target DNA sequences and small molecule ligands of purified recombinant PenR and PntR were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. PenR bound to DNA from both the penR-gapN and penM-penH intergenic regions, while PntR bound only the corresponding pntR-gapR intergenic region. The targets of PenR and PntR were shown to be limited to conserved 37-bp DNA segments. Pentalenolactone and two late-stage biosynthetic intermediates, pentalenolactones D and F, act as ligands of both PenR and PntR, resulting in release of these proteins from their target DNA. The production of pentalenolactones was significantly decreased in the penR deletion mutant S. exfoliatus ÎpenR ZD27 but could be restored by complementation with either penR or pntR. Reverse transcription-PCR established that transcription of pentalenolactone biosynthetic and resistance genes decreased, while that of the penR gene itself increased in the penR deletion mutant S. exfoliatus ZD27 compared to the wild-type strain. The PenR protein thus serves as a positive regulator of pentalenolactone biosynthesis and self-resistance while acting as an autorepressor of penR.",

However, the chronic nature of these diseases requires either prolonged or re-treatment, often with acquired resistance as a consequence.<h4>Methods</h4>Here we studied the molecular basis of acquired resistance to BTZ in JY human B lymphoblastic cells following prolonged exposure to this drug and examined possibilities to overcome resistance by next generation PIs and anti-CD20/rituximab-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).<h4>Results</h4>Characterization of BTZ-resistant JY/BTZ cells compared to parental JY/WT cells revealed the following features: (a) 10-12 fold resistance to BTZ associated with the acquisition of a mutation in the PSMB5 gene (encoding the constitutive Î²5 proteasome subunit) introducing an amino acid substitution (Met45Ile) in the BTZ-binding pocket, (b) a significant 2-4 fold increase in the mRNA and protein levels of the constitutive Î²5 proteasome subunit along with unaltered immunoproteasome expression, (c) full sensitivity to the irreversible epoxyketone-based PIs carfilzomib and (to a lesser extent) the immunoproteasome inhibitor ONX 0914. Finally, in association with impaired ubiquitination and attenuated breakdown of CD20, JY/BTZ cells harbored a net 3-fold increase in CD20 cell surface expression, which was functionally implicated in conferring a significantly increased anti-CD20/rituximab-mediated CDC.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results demonstrate that acquired resistance to BTZ in B cells can be overcome by next generation PIs and by anti-CD20/rituximab-induced CDC, thereby paving the way for salvage therapy in BTZ-resistant disease.",

However, whether cytohesins are essential in colorectal cancer is unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether cytohesins contribute to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway in colorectal cancer cells. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence experiments were employed to detect the expression of cytohesins in colorectal cancer cell lines. The EGF pathway activation conditions were investigated by examining the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and intracellular signal-related kinases, with or without chemical inhibition (SecinH3) and knockdown of cytohesins. An MTT assay was conducted to examine the inhibitory effect of SecinH3 and cytohesin-specific siRNA in HT-29 cells. Results demonstrated that the four homologous members of the cytohesin family were expressed in the four colorectal cancer cell lines. Notably, a significantly higher expression level of cytohesin-2 (ARNO) compared with the other three homologous family members was observed. Stimulation with EGF and SecinH3, as well as knockdown of ARNO, are capable of reducing EGF pathway activation and proliferation of HT-29 cells. In conclusion, cytohesins play an essential role in the activation of the EGF pathway and may be a potential target in colorectal cancer therapy.",

The NiO nanostructures were characterized by field emission electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The characterized NiO nanostructures were uniform, dense and polycrystalline in the crystal phase. In addition to this, the  NiO nanostructures were used in the development of a zinc ion sensor electrode by functionalization with the highly selective zinc ion ionophore 12-crown-4. The developed zinc ion sensor electrode has shown a good linear potentiometric response for a wide range of zinc ion concentrations, ranging from 0.001 mM to 100 mM, with sensitivity of  36 mV/decade. The detection limit of the present zinc ion sensor was found to be  0.0005 mM and it also displays a fast response time of less than 10 s. The proposed zinc ion sensor electrode has also shown good reproducibility, repeatability, storage stability and selectivity. The zinc ion sensor based on the functionalized NiO nanostructures was also used as indicator electrode in potentiometric titrations and it has demonstrated an acceptable stoichiometric relationship for the determination of zinc ion in unknown samples. The NiO nanostructures-based zinc ion sensor has potential for analysing zinc ion in various industrial, clinical and other real samples.",

Although horizontal gene transfer and insertion-deletion events are clearly important for promoting divergence among these genomes, recent studies have demonstrated that a major basis for phenotypic diversity in these organisms may be differential regulation of the highly similar gene content shared by these organisms. To explore this hypothesis, we used an in silico approach to evaluate the relationship of pathogenic potential and the divergence of the SigB-dependent general stress response within the B. cereus sensu lato group, since SigB has been demonstrated to support pathogenesis in Bacillus, Listeria and Staphylococcus species.<h4>Results</h4>During the divergence of these organisms from a common \"SigB-less\" ancestor, the placement of SigB promoters at varied locations in the B. cereus sensu lato genomes predict alternative structures for the SigB regulon in different organisms. Predicted promoter changes suggesting differential transcriptional control of a common gene pool predominate over evidence of indels or horizontal gene transfer for explaining SigB regulon divergence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Four lineages of the SigB regulon have arisen that encompass different gene contents and suggest different strategies for supporting pathogenesis. This is consistent with the hypothesis that divergence within the B. cereus sensu lato group rests in part on alternative strategies for regulation of a common gene pool.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus has become the most important airborne fungal pathogen causing life-threatening infections in immuno-compromised patients. Recently developed high-throughput transcriptome and proteome technologies, such as microarrays, RNA deep-sequencing, and LC-MS/MS of peptide mixtures, are of enormous value for systematically investigating pathogenic organisms. In the field of infection biology, one of the priorities is to collect and standardise data, in order to generate datasets that can be used to investigate and compare pathways and gene responses involved in pathogenicity. The \"omics\" era provides a multitude of inputs that need to be integrated and assessed. We therefore evaluated the potential of paired-end mRNA-Seq for investigating the regulatory role of the central mitogen activated protein kinase (MpkA). This kinase is involved in the cell wall integrity signalling pathway of A. fumigatus and essential for maintaining an intact cell wall in response to stress.<h4>Results</h4>The comparison of the transcriptome and proteome of an A. fumigatus wild-type strain with an mpkA null mutant strain revealed that 70.4% of the genome was found to be expressed and that MpkA plays a significant role in the regulation of many genes involved in cell wall remodelling, oxidative stress and iron starvation response, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Moreover, absence of the mpkA gene also strongly affects the expression of genes involved in primary metabolism. The data were further processed to evaluate the potential of the mRNA-Seq technique. We comprehensively matched up our data to published transcriptome studies and were able to show an improved data comparability of mRNA-Seq experiments independently of the technique used. Analysis of transcriptome and proteome data revealed only a weak correlation between mRNA and protein abundance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>High-throughput analysis of MpkA-dependent gene expression confirmed many previous findings that this kinase is important for regulating many genes involved in metabolic pathways. Our analysis showed more than 2000 differentially regulated genes. RNA deep-sequencing is less error-prone than established microarray-based technologies. It also provides additional information in A. fumigatus studies and as a result is more suitable for the creation of extensive datasets.",

        "pmc_abstract": "There is a continuing need to discover new bioactive natural products, such as antibiotics, in genetically-amenable micro-organisms. We observed that the enteric insect pathogen, Serratia marcescens Db10, produced a diffusible compound that inhibited the growth of Bacillis subtilis and Staphyloccocus aureus. Mapping the genetic locus required for this activity revealed a putative natural product biosynthetic gene cluster, further defined to a six-gene operon named alb1-alb6. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins encoded by alb1-6 predicted a hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) assembly line (Alb4/5/6), tailoring enzymes (Alb2/3) and an export/resistance protein (Alb1), and suggested that the machinery assembled althiomycin or a related molecule. Althiomycin is a ribosome-inhibiting antibiotic whose biosynthetic machinery had been elusive for decades. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses confirmed that wild type S. marcescens produced althiomycin and that production was eliminated on disruption of the alb gene cluster. Construction of mutants with in-frame deletions of specific alb genes demonstrated that Alb2-Alb5 were essential for althiomycin production, whereas Alb6 was required for maximal production of the antibiotic. A phosphopantetheinyl transferase enzyme required for althiomycin biosynthesis was also identified. Expression of Alb1, a predicted major facilitator superfamily efflux pump, conferred althiomycin resistance on another, sensitive, strain of S. marcescens. This is the first report of althiomycin production outside of the Myxobacteria or Streptomyces and paves the way for future exploitation of the biosynthetic machinery, since S. marcescens represents a convenient and tractable producing organism.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antibiotics are chemotherapeutic agents, which have been a very powerful tool in the clinical management of bacterial diseases since the 1940s. However, benefits offered by these magic bullets have been substantially lost in subsequent days following the widespread emergence and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant strains. While it is obvious that excessive and imprudent use of antibiotics significantly contributes to the emergence of resistant strains, antibiotic resistance is also observed in natural bacteria of remote places unlikely to be impacted by human intervention. Both antibiotic biosynthetic genes and resistance-conferring genes have been known to evolve billions of years ago, long before clinical use of antibiotics. Hence it appears that antibiotics and antibiotics resistance determinants have some other roles in nature, which often elude our attention because of overemphasis on the therapeutic importance of antibiotics and the crisis imposed by the antibiotic resistance in pathogens. In the natural milieu, antibiotics are often found to be present in sub-inhibitory concentrations acting as signaling molecules supporting the process of quorum sensing and biofilm formation. They also play an important role in the production of virulence factors and influence host-parasite interactions (e.g., phagocytosis, adherence to the target cell, and so on). The evolutionary and ecological aspects of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance in the naturally occurring microbial community are little understood. Therefore, the actual role of antibiotics in nature warrants in-depth investigations. Studies on such an intriguing behavior of the microorganisms promise insight into the intricacies of the microbial physiology and are likely to provide some lead in controlling the emergence and subsequent dissemination of antibiotic resistance. This article highlights some of the recent findings on the role of antibiotics and the genes that confer resistance to antibiotics in nature.",

However, there is limited information on their resistance to various antibiotics, and there is a growing concern over the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. The MIC for 8 antibiotics was determined for 85 Bacillus species strains, Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis (n = 29), Bacillus licheniformis (n = 38), and Bacillus sonorensis (n = 18), all of which were isolated from starters for Sudanese bread production. All the strains were sensitive to tetracycline (8.0 mg/liter), vancomycin (4.0 mg/liter), and gentamicin (4.0 mg/liter) but resistant to streptomycin. Sensitivity to clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin was species specific. The erythromycin resistance genes ermD and ermK were detected by PCR in all of the erythromycin-resistant (MIC, â¥16.0 mg/liter) B. licheniformis strains and one erythromycin-sensitive (MIC, 4.0 mg/liter) B. licheniformis strain. Several amino acid changes were present in the translated ermD and ermK nucleotide sequences of the erythromycin-sensitive strain, which could indicate ErmD and ErmK protein functionalities different from those of the resistance strains. The ermD and ermK genes were localized on an 11.4-kbp plasmid. All of the B. sonorensis strains harbored the bacitracin synthetase gene, bacA, and the transporter gene bcrA, which correlated with their observed resistance to bacitracin. Bacitracin was produced by all the investigated species strains (28%), as determined by ultra-high-definition quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHD-QTOF LC/MS). The present study has revealed species-specific variations in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Bacillus spp. and provides new information on MIC values, as well as the occurrence of resistance genes in Bacillus spp., including the newly described species B. sonorensis.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The otrC gene of Streptomyces rimosus was previously annotated as an oxytetracycline (OTC) resistance protein. However, the amino acid sequence analysis of OtrC shows that it is a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter with multidrug resistance function. To our knowledge, none of the ABC transporters in S. rimosus have yet been characterized. In this study, we aimed to characterize the multidrug exporter function of OtrC and evaluate its relevancy to OTC production.<h4>Results</h4>In order to investigate OtrC's function, otrC is cloned and expressed in E. coli The exporter function of OtrC was identified by ATPase activity determination and ethidium bromide efflux assays. Also, the susceptibilities of OtrC-overexpressing cells to several structurally unrelated drugs were compared with those of OtrC-non-expressing cells by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays, indicating that OtrC functions as a drug exporter with a broad range of drug specificities. The OTC production was enhanced by 1.6-fold in M4018 (Pâ=â0.000877) and 1.4-fold in SR16 (Pâ=â0.00973) duplication mutants, while it decreased to 80% in disruption mutants (Pâ=â0.0182 and 0.0124 in M4018 and SR16, respectively).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results suggest that OtrC is an ABC transporter with multidrug resistance function, and plays an important role in self-protection by drug efflux mechanisms. This is the first report of such a protein in S. rimosus, and otrC could be a valuable target for genetic manipulation to improve the production of industrial antibiotics.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Identifying and understanding the collection of all antibiotic resistance determinants presented in the global microbiota, the antibiotic resistome, provides insight into the evolution of antibiotic resistance and critical information for the development of future antimicrobials. The rifamycins are broad-spectrum antibiotics that target bacterial transcription by inhibition of RNA polymerase. Although mutational alteration of the drug target is the predominant mechanism of resistance to this family of antibiotics in the clinic, a number of diverse inactivation mechanisms have also been reported. In this report, we investigate a subset of environmental rifampin-resistant actinomycete isolates and identify a diverse collection of rifampin inactivation mechanisms. We describe a single isolate, WAC1438, capable of inactivating rifampin by glycosylation. A draft genome sequence of WAC1438 (most closely related to Streptomyces speibonae, according to a 16S rRNA gene comparison) was assembled, and the associated rifampin glycosyltransferase open reading frame, rgt1438, was identified. The role of rgt1438 in rifampin resistance was confirmed by its disruption in the bacterial chromosome, resulting in a loss of antibiotic inactivation and a 4-fold decrease in MIC. Interestingly, examination of the RNA polymerase Î²-subunit sequence of WAC1438 suggests that it harbors a resistant target and thus possesses dual mechanisms of rifamycin resistance. Using an in vitro assay with purified enzyme, Rgt1438 could inactivate a variety of rifamycin antibiotics with comparable steady-state kinetics constants. Our results identify rgt1438 as a rifampin resistance determinant from WAC1438 capable of inactivating an assortment of rifamycins, adding a new element to the rifampin resistome.",

Isolation and subsequent structure determination of bioactive molecules led to the identification of two polyamino antibiotics with the same molecular structure as zeamine and zeamine II as well as a third, closely related analogue, designated zeamine I. The gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the zeamine antibiotics was cloned and sequenced and shown to encode FAS, PKS as well as NRPS related enzymes in addition to putative tailoring and export enzymes. Interestingly, several genes show strong homology to the pfa cluster of genes involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in marine bacteria. We postulate that a mixed FAS/PKS and a hybrid NRPS/PKS assembly line each synthesize parts of the backbone that are linked together post-assembly in the case of zeamine and zeamine I. This interaction reflects a unique interplay between secondary lipid and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Most likely, the zeamine antibiotics are produced as prodrugs that undergo activation in which a nonribosomal peptide sequence is cleaved off.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Meiotic drive is a non-Mendelian inheritance phenomenon in which certain selfish genetic elements skew sexual transmission in their own favor. In some cases, progeny or gametes carrying a meiotic drive element can survive preferentially because it causes the death or malfunctioning of those that do not carry it. In Neurospora, meiotic drive can be observed in fungal spore killing. In a cross of Spore killer (Sk) Ã WT (Sk-sensitive), the ascospores containing the Spore killer allele survive, whereas the ones with the sensitive allele degenerate. Sk-2 and Sk-3 are the most studied meiotic drive elements in Neurospora, and they each theoretically contain two essential components: a killer element and a resistance gene. Here we report the identification and characterization of the Sk resistance gene, rsk (resistant to Spore killer). rsk seems to be a fungal-specific gene, and its deletion in a killer strain leads to self-killing. Sk-2, Sk-3, and naturally resistant isolates all use rsk for resistance. In each killer system, rsk sequences from an Sk strain and a resistant isolate are highly similar, suggesting that they share the same origin. Sk-2, Sk-3, and sensitive rsk alleles differ from each other by their unique indel patterns. Contrary to long-held belief, the killer targets not only late but also early ascospore development. The WT RSK protein is dispensable for ascospore production and is not a target of the spore-killing mechanism. Rather, a resistant version of RSK likely neutralizes the killer element and prevents it from interfering with ascospore development.",

The compound is produced by several strains of streptomycetes and pseudomonads. We sequenced the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for fosfomycin production in Pseudomonas syringae PB-5123. Surprisingly, the biosynthetic pathway in this organism is very different from that in Streptomyces fradiae and Streptomyces wedmorensis. The pathways share the first and last steps, involving conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) and 2-hydroxypropylphosphonate (2-HPP) to fosfomycin, respectively, but the enzymes converting PnPy to 2-HPP are different. The genome of P. syringae PB-5123 lacks a gene encoding the PnPy decarboxylase found in the Streptomyces strains. Instead, it contains a gene coding for a citrate synthase-like enzyme, Psf2, homologous to the proteins that add an acetyl group to PnPy in the biosynthesis of FR-900098 and phosphinothricin. Heterologous expression and purification of Psf2 followed by activity assays confirmed the proposed activity of Psf2. Furthermore, heterologous production of fosfomycin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a fosmid encoding the fosfomycin biosynthetic cluster from P. syringae PB-5123 confirmed that the gene cluster is functional. Therefore, two different pathways have evolved to produce this highly potent antimicrobial agent.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The cytochrome P450 enzymes MycCI and MycG are encoded within the mycinamicin biosynthetic gene cluster and are involved in the biosynthesis of mycinamicin II (a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic produced by Micromonospora griseorubida). Based on recent enzymatic studies, MycCI is characterized as the C-21 methyl hydroxylase of mycinamicin VIII, while MycG is designated multifunctional P450, which catalyzes hydroxylation and also epoxidation at C-14 and C-12/13 on the macrolactone ring of mycinamicin. Here, we confirm the functions of MycCI and MycG in M. griseorubida. Protomycinolide IV and mycinamicin VIII accumulated in the culture broth of the mycCI disruption mutant; moreover, the mycCI gene fragment complemented the production of mycinamicin I and mycinamicin II, which are produced as major mycinamicins by the wild strain M. griseorubida A11725. The mycG disruption mutant did not produce mycinamicin I and mycinamicin II; however, mycinamicin IV accumulated in the culture broth. The mycG gene was located immediately downstream of the self-resistance gene myrB. The mycG gene under the control of mycGp complemented the production of mycinamicin I and mycinamicin II. Furthermore, the amount of mycinamicin II produced by the strain complemented with the mycG gene under the control of myrBp was approximately 2-fold higher than that produced by the wild strain. In M. griseorubida, MycG recognized mycinamicin IV, mycinamicin V, and also mycinamicin III as the substrates. Moreover, it catalyzed hydroxylation and also epoxidation at C-14 and C-12/13 on these intermediates. However, C-14 on mycinamicin I was not hydroxylated.",

        "pmc_abstract": "We have recently cloned a D-cycloserine (DCS) biosynthetic gene cluster that consists of 10 genes, designated dcsA~dcsJ, from Streptomyces lavendulae ATCC 11924 (16). In the predicted pathway of hydroxyurea (HU) formation in DCS biosynthesis, L-arginine (L-Arg) must first be hydroxylated, prior to the hydrolysis of N(Ï)-hydroxy-L-arginine (NHA) by DcsB, an arginase homolog. The hydroxylation of L-Arg is known to be catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). In this study, to verify the supply route of HU, we created a dcsB-disrupted mutant, ÎdcsB. While the mutant lost DCS productivity, its productivity was restored by complementation of dcsB, and also by the addition of HU but not NHA, suggesting that HU is supplied by DcsB. A NOS-encoding gene, nos, from S. lavendulae chromosome was cloned, to create a nos-disrupted mutant. However, the mutant maintained the DCS productivity, suggesting that NOS is not necessary for DCS biosynthesis. To clarify the identity of an enzyme necessary for NHA formation, a dcsA-disrupted mutant, designated ÎdcsA, was also created. The mutant lost DCS productivity, whereas the DCS productivity was restored by complementation of dcsA. The addition of NHA to the culture medium of ÎdcsA mutant was also effective to restore DCS production. These results indicate that the dcsA gene product, DcsA, is an enzyme essential to generate NHA as a precursor in the DCS biosynthetic pathway. Spectroscopic analyses of the recombinant DcsA revealed that it is a heme protein, supporting an idea that DcsA is an enzyme catalyzing hydroxylation.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a fungal secondary metabolite and the active component in several immunosuppressive pharmaceuticals. The gene cluster coding for the MPA biosynthetic pathway has recently been discovered in Penicillium brevicompactum, demonstrating that the first step is catalyzed by MpaC, a polyketide synthase producing 5-methylorsellinic acid (5-MOA). However, the biochemical role of the enzymes encoded by the remaining genes in the MPA gene cluster is still unknown. Based on bioinformatic analysis of the MPA gene cluster, we hypothesized that the step following 5-MOA production in the pathway is carried out by a natural fusion enzyme MpaDE, consisting of a cytochrome P450 (MpaD) in the N-terminal region and a hydrolase (MpaE) in the C-terminal region. We verified that the fusion gene is indeed expressed in P. brevicompactum by obtaining full-length sequence of the mpaDE cDNA prepared from the extracted RNA. Heterologous coexpression of mpaC and the fusion gene mpaDE in the MPA-nonproducer Aspergillus nidulans resulted in the production of 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylphthalide (DHMP), the second intermediate in MPA biosynthesis. Analysis of the strain coexpressing mpaC and the mpaD part of mpaDE shows that the P450 catalyzes hydroxylation of 5-MOA to 4,6-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-methylbenzoic acid (DHMB). DHMB is then converted to DHMP, and our results suggest that the hydrolase domain aids this second step by acting as a lactone synthase that catalyzes the ring closure. Overall, the chimeric enzyme MpaDE provides insight into the genetic organization of the MPA biosynthesis pathway.",

In plant experiments with the soybean pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea both, Pa48b and the APV-negative mutant, successfully suppressed the pathogen.

The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is found in many bacterial species and is used to target either eukaryotic cells or competitor bacteria. However, T6SS-secreted proteins have proven surprisingly elusive. Here, we identified two secreted substrates of the antibacterial T6SS from the opportunistic human pathogen, Serratia marcescens. Ssp1 and Ssp2, both encoded within the T6SS gene cluster, were confirmed as antibacterial toxins delivered by the T6SS. Four related proteins encoded around the Ssp proteins ('Rap' proteins) included two specifically conferring self-resistance ('immunity') against T6SS-dependent Ssp1 or Ssp2 toxicity. Biochemical characterization revealed specific, tight binding between cognate Ssp-Rap pairs, forming complexes of 2:2 stoichiometry. The atomic structures of two Rap proteins were solved, revealing a novel helical fold, dependent on a structural disulphide bond, a structural feature consistent with their functional localization. Homologues of the Serratia Ssp and Rap proteins are found encoded together within other T6SS gene clusters, thus they represent founder members of new families of T6SS-secreted and cognate immunity proteins. We suggest that Ssp proteins are the original substrates of the S.âmarcescens T6SS, before horizontal acquisition of other T6SS-secreted toxins. Molecular insight has been provided into how pathogens utilize antibacterial T6SSs to overcome competitors and succeed in polymicrobial niches.",

While both mutants exhibited significant sensitivity to both exogenous gliotoxin (P < 0.001) and H(2)O(2) (P < 0.01), unexpectedly, exogenous gliotoxin relieved H(2)O(2)-induced growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner (0 to 10 Î¼g/ml).

        "pmc_abstract": "The environment, and especially freshwater, constitutes a reactor where the evolution and the rise of new resistances occur. In water bodies such as waste water effluents, lakes, and rivers or streams, bacteria from different sources, e.g., urban, industrial, and agricultural waste, probably selected by intensive antibiotic usage, are collected and mixed with environmental species. This may cause two effects on the development of antibiotic resistances: first, the contamination of water by antibiotics or other pollutants lead to the rise of resistances due to selection processes, for instance, of strains over-expressing broad range defensive mechanisms, such as efflux pumps. Second, since environmental species are provided with intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanisms, the mixture with allochthonous species is likely to cause genetic exchange. In this context, the role of phages and integrons for the spread of resistance mechanisms appears significant. Allochthonous species could acquire new resistances from environmental donors and introduce the newly acquired resistance mechanisms into the clinics. This is illustrated by clinically relevant resistance mechanisms, such as the fluoroquinolones resistance genes qnr. Freshwater appears to play an important role in the emergence and in the spread of antibiotic resistances, highlighting the necessity for strategies of water quality improvement. We assume that further knowledge is needed to better understand the role of the environment as reservoir of antibiotic resistances and to elucidate the link between environmental pollution by anthropogenic pressures and emergence of antibiotic resistances.

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>There has been a rising incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in critically ill patients, even in the absence of an apparent predisposing immunodeficiency. The diagnosis of IA is difficult because clinical signs are not sensitive and specific, and serum galactomannan has relatively low sensitivity in this group of patients. Therefore, more prompt and accurate disease markers for early diagnosis are needed. To establish disease markers demands a thorough knowledge of fungal antigens which may be detected in the serum or other body fluids of patients. Herein we report novel immunodominant antigens identified from extracellular proteins of Aspergillus fumigatus.<h4>Results</h4>Extracellular proteins of A. fumigatus were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and probed with the sera from critically ill patients with proven IA. The immunoreactive protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF -MS). Forty spots from 2DE gels were detected and 17 different proteins were identified as immunogenic in humans. Function annotation revealed that most of these proteins were metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid, amino acid, and energy metabolism. One of the proteins, thioredoxin reductase GliT (TR), which showed the best immunoactivity, was analyzed further for secretory signals, protein localization, and homology. The results indicated that TR is a secretory protein with a signal sequence exhibiting a high probability for secretion. Furthermore, TR did not match any human proteins, and had low homology with most other fungi. The recombinant TR was recognized by the sera of all proven IA patients with different underlying diseases in this study.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The immunoreactive proteins identified in this study may be helpful for the diagnosis of IA in critically ill patients. Our results indicate that TR and other immunodominant antigens have potential as biomarkers for the serologic diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.",

In silico analysis places the SimReg1 protein in the OmpR-PhoB subfamily of response regulators. Gene replacement of simReg1 from the S. antibioticus chromosome completely abolishes simocyclinone production indicating that SimReg1 is a key regulator of simocyclinone biosynthesis. Results of the DNA-shift assays and reporter gene expression analysis are consistent with the idea that SimReg1 activates transcription of simocyclinone biosynthesis, transporter genes, regulatory gene simReg3 and his own transcription. The presence of extracts (simocyclinone) from S. antibioticus TÃ¼6040 Ã pSSimR1-1 could dissociate SimReg1 from promoter regions.

        "pmc_abstract": "\"Trojan horse\" antibiotic albomycins are peptidyl nucleosides consisting of a highly modified 4'-thiofuranosyl cytosine moiety and a ferrichrome siderophore that are linked by a peptide bond via a serine residue. While the latter component serves to sequester iron from the environment, the seryl nucleoside portion is a potent inhibitor of bacterial seryl-tRNA synthetases, resulting in broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities of albomycin Î´(2). The isolation of albomycins has revealed this biological activity is optimized only following two unusual cytosine modifications, N4-carbamoylation and N3-methylation. We identified a genetic locus (named abm) for albomycin production in Streptomyces sp. ATCC 700974. Gene deletion and complementation experiments along with bioinformatic analysis suggested 18 genes are responsible for albomycin biosynthesis and resistance, allowing us to propose a potential biosynthetic pathway for installing the novel chemical features. The gene abmI, encoding a putative methyltransferase, was functionally assigned in vitro and shown to modify the N3 of a variety of cytosine-containing nucleosides and antibiotics such as blasticidin S. Furthermore, a ÎabmI mutant was shown to produce the descarbamoyl-desmethyl albomycin analogue, supporting that the N3-methylation occurs before the N4-carbamoylation in the biosynthesis of albomycin Î´(2). The combined genetic information was utilized to identify an abm-related locus (named ctj) from the draft genome of Streptomyces sp. C. Cross-complementation experiments and in vitro studies with CtjF, the AbmI homologue, suggest the production of a similar 4'-thiofuranosyl cytosine in this organism. In total, the genetic and biochemical data provide a biosynthetic template for assembling siderophore-inhibitor conjugates and modifying the albomycin scaffold to generate new derivatives.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Salinomycin is widely used in animal husbandry as a food additive due to its antibacterial and anticoccidial activities. However, its biosynthesis had only been studied by feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors. A strategy with degenerate primers based on the polyether-specific epoxidase sequences was successfully developed to clone the salinomycin gene cluster. Using this strategy, a putative epoxidase gene, slnC, was cloned from the salinomycin producer Streptomyces albus XM211. The targeted replacement of slnC and subsequent trans-complementation proved its involvement in salinomycin biosynthesis. A 127-kb DNA region containing slnC was sequenced, including genes for polyketide assembly and release, oxidative cyclization, modification, export, and regulation. In order to gain insight into the salinomycin biosynthesis mechanism, 13 gene replacements and deletions were conducted. Including slnC, 7 genes were identified as essential for salinomycin biosynthesis and putatively responsible for polyketide chain release, oxidative cyclization, modification, and regulation. Moreover, 6 genes were found to be relevant to salinomycin biosynthesis and possibly involved in precursor supply, removal of aberrant extender units, and regulation. Sequence analysis and a series of gene replacements suggest a proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of salinomycin. The information presented here expands the understanding of polyether biosynthesis mechanisms and paves the way for targeted engineering of salinomycin activity and productivity.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Pantoea vagans C9-1 is a biocontrol strain that produces at least two antibiotics inhibiting the growth of Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight disease of pear and apple. One antibiotic, herbicolin I, was purified from culture filtrates of P. vagans C9-1 and determined to be 2-amino-3-(oxirane-2,3-dicarboxamido)-propanoyl-valine, also known as N(Ã)-epoxysuccinamoyl-DAP-valine. A plasposon library was screened for mutants that had lost the ability to produce herbicolin I. It was shown that mutants had reduced biocontrol efficacy in immature pear assays. The biosynthetic gene cluster in P. vagans C9-1 was identified by sequencing the flanking regions of the plasposon insertion sites. The herbicolin I biosynthetic gene cluster consists of 10 coding sequences (CDS) and is located on the 166-kb plasmid pPag2. Sequence comparisons identified orthologous gene clusters in Pantoea agglomerans CU0119 and Serratia proteamaculans 568. A low incidence of detection of the biosynthetic cluster in a collection of 45 Pantoea spp. from biocontrol, environmental, and clinical origins showed that this is a rare trait among the tested strains.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Objective</h4>The clavulanic acid regulatory gene (claR) is in the clavulanic acid biosynthetic gene cluster that encodes ClaR. This protein is a putative regulator of the late steps of clavulanic acid biosynthesis. The aim of this research is the molecular cloning of claR, isolated from the Iranian strain of Streptomyces clavuligerus (S. clavuligerus).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this experimental study, two different strains of S. clavuligerus were used (PTCC 1705 and DSM 738), of which there is no claR sequence record for strain PTCC 1705 in all three main gene banks. The specific designed primers were subjected to a few base modifications for introduction of the recognition sites of BamHI and ClaI. The claR gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using DNA isolated from S. clavuligerus PTCC 1705. Nested-PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and sequencing were used for molecular analysis of the claR gene. The confirmed claR was subjected to double digestion with BamHI and ClaI. The cut claR was ligated into a pBluescript (pBs) vector and transformed into E. coli.<h4>Results</h4>The entire sequence of the isolated claR (Iranian strain) was identified. The presence of the recombinant vector in the transformed colonies was confirmed by the colony-PCR procedure. The correct structure of the recombinant vector, isolated from the transformed E. coli, was confirmed using gel electrophoresis, PCR, and double digestion with restriction enzymes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The constructed recombinant cassette, named pZSclaR, can be regarded as an appropriate tool for site directed mutagenesis and sub-cloning. At this time, claR has been cloned accompanied with its precisely selected promoter so it could be used in expression vectors. Hence the ClaR is known as a putative regulatory protein. The overproduced protein could also be used for other related investigations, such as a mobility shift assay.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The saprophytic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is the most important air-borne fungal pathogen. The cell wall of A. fumigatus has been studied intensively as a potential target for development of effective antifungal agents. A major role in maintaining cell wall integrity is played by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) MpkA. To gain a comprehensive insight into this central signal transduction pathway, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the ÎmpkA mutant under standard and cell wall stress conditions. Besides genes involved in cell wall remodelling, protection against ROS and secondary metabolism such as gliotoxin, pyomelanin and pseurotin A, also genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis were regulated by MpkA. Consistently, northern and western blot analyses indicated that iron starvation triggers phosphorylation and thus activation of MpkA. Furthermore, localization studies indicated that MpkA accumulates in the nucleus under iron depletion. Hence, we report the first connection between a MAPK pathway and siderophore biosynthesis. The measurement of amino acid pools and of the pools of polyamines indicated that arginine was continuously converted into ornithine to fuel the siderophore pool in the ÎmpkA mutant strain. Based on our data, we propose that MpkA fine-tunes the balance between stress response and energy consuming cellular processes.",

Nevertheless, several marine-derived agents are now approved, most as \"first-in-class\" drugs, with five of seven appearing in the past few years. Additionally, there is a rich pipeline of clinical and preclinical marine compounds to suggest their continued application in human medicine. Understanding of how these agents are biosynthetically assembled has accelerated in recent years, especially through interdisciplinary approaches, and innovative manipulations and re-engineering of some of these gene clusters are yielding novel agents of enhanced pharmaceutical properties compared with the natural product.",

Many structurally diverse inhibitors of these active sites, both natural product and synthetic, have been discovered in the last two decades. One, bortezomib, is used clinically for treatment of multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and acute allograft rejection. Five more recently developed proteasome inhibitors are in trials for treatment of myeloma and other cancers. Proteasome inhibitors also have activity in animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, reperfusion injury, promote bone and hair growth, and can potentially be used as anti-infectives.

Annotation of a segment of 88912bp of S. viridochromogenes genomic sequence revealed the putative lpm cluster and its flanking regions which harbor 43 open reading frames. The lpm cluster, which spans approximately 60 kb, consists of 21 open reading frames. Those include four NRPS genes (lpmA/orf18, lpmB/orf25, lpmC/orf26 and lpmD/orf27), four genes (orfs 21, 22, 24 and 29) involved in the lipid tail biosynthesis and attachment, four regulatory genes (orfs 13, 19, 32 and 33) and three putative exporters or self-resistance genes (orfs 14, 20 and 30). In addition, the gene involved in the biosynthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acid Pip was also identified in the lpm cluster while the genes necessary for the biosynthesis of the rare residue diaminopropionic acid (Dap) were found to reside elsewhere on the chromosome. Interestingly, the dabA, dabB and dabC genes predicted to code for the biosynthesis of the unusual amino acid diaminobutyric acid (Dab) are organized into the lpm cluster even though the Dab residue was not found in the laspartomycins. Disruption of the NRPS lpmC gene completely abolished laspartomycin production in the corresponding mutant strain. These findings will allow molecular engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis approaches to expand the structural diversity of the amphomycin-group peptide antibiotics including the laspartomycins and friulimicins.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Pathogenic bacteria can resist their microenvironment by changing the expression of virulence genes. In Salmonella typhimurium, some of these genes are controlled by the two-component system PhoP-PhoQ. Studies have shown that activation of the system by cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) results, among other changes, in outer membrane remodeling. However, it is not fully clear what characteristics of AMPs are required to activate the PhoP-PhoQ system and whether activation can induce resistance to the various AMPs. For that purpose, we investigated the ability of a broad repertoire of AMPs to traverse the inner membrane, to activate the PhoP-PhoQ system, and to induce bacterial resistance. The AMPs differ in length, composition, and net positive charge, and the tested bacteria include two wild-type (WT) Salmonella strains and their corresponding PhoP-PhoQ knock-out mutants. A lacZ-reporting system was adapted to follow PhoP-PhoQ activation. The data revealed that: (i) a good correlation exists among the extent of the positive charge, hydrophobicity, and amphipathicity of an AMP and its potency to activate PhoP-PhoQ; (ii) a +1 charged peptide containing histidines was highly potent, suggesting the existence of an additional mechanism independent of the peptide charge; (iii) the WT bacteria are more resistant to AMPs that are potent activators of PhoP-PhoQ; (iv) only a subset of AMPs, independent of their potency to activate the system, is more toxic to the mutated bacteria compared with the WT strains; and (v) short term exposure of WT bacteria to these AMPs does not enhance resistance. Overall, this study advances our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which AMPs activate PhoP-PhoQ and induce bacterial resistance. It also reveals that some AMPs can overcome such a resistance mechanism.",

Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the expression profile of 102 genes changed in response to this concentration of chloramphenicol in the culture medium. The genes that showed altered expression include those involved in general metabolism, cellular stress response, gene regulation, efflux pump transporters, and protein biosynthesis. Analysis of a genome-wide collection of mutants showed that survival of a knockout mutant in the TtgABC resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump and mutants in the biosynthesis of pyrroloquinoline (PQQ) were compromised in the presence of chloramphenicol. The analysis also revealed that an ABC extrusion system (PP2669/PP2668/PP2667) and the AgmR regulator (PP2665) were needed for full resistance toward chloramphenicol. Transcriptional arrays revealed that AgmR controls the expression of the pqq genes and the operon encoding the ABC extrusion pump from the promoter upstream of open reading frame (ORF) PP2669.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Signals emanating from receptors of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor (TNF/NGF) family control practically all aspects of immune defense and, as such, constitute potential targets for therapeutic intervention through rational drug design. Indeed, arrest of these signals by blocking ligand-receptor interactions enables effective suppression of a variety of activities that are implicated in various pathologies, such as T and B lymphocyte activation and growth, inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, and cell death. To be therapeutically useful, however, inhibition of signaling should be restricted by determinants of specificity, at least to the same degree observed when blocking activation of individual receptors. In spite of their broad range of functions, receptors of the TNF/NGF family are known to activate just a few signaling pathways. Of these, the most extensively studied are the activation of the caspase protease cascade, which leads to cell death, and the activation of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) transcription factors through protein phosphorylation cascades. Until recently, most studies of the two pathways have solely focused on the core signaling complexes that are shared by the different receptors: death-inducing complexes containing the cysteine proteases caspase-8 and caspase-10, bound to the adapter protein MORT1/FADD (mediator of receptor-induced toxicity/Fas-associated DD protein), and the NF-kappaB-activating complex, composed of the protein kinases IKK1 (IkappaB kinase 1) and IKK2 (IkappaB kinase 2) and the regulatory subunit NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator; the 'IKK signalosome'). Knowledge has begun to emerge of additional molecules and mechanisms that affect these basic signaling complexes and impose specificity on their function.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Vancomycin and teicoplanin are glycopeptides active against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria. For 30 years following the discovery of vancomycin in 1956, vancomycin resistance was not detected among normally susceptible bacteria recovered from human specimens. Since 1986, however, bacteria resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin or both have been described. Strains of the genera Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Erysipelothrix seem inherently resistant to glycopeptides. Species and strains of enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci appear to have acquired or developed resistance. There are at least two categories of glycopeptide resistance among enterococci, characterized by either high-level resistance to vancomycin (MIC, greater than or equal to 64 mg/liter) and teicoplanin (MIC, greater than or equal to 8 mg/liter) or lower-level vancomycin resistance (MIC, 32 to 64 mg/liter) and teicoplanin susceptibility (MIC, less than or equal to 1 mg/liter). The two categories appear to have similar resistance mechanisms, although genetic and biochemical studies indicate that they have arisen independently. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, strains for which vancomycin MICs are up to 20 mg/liter or teicoplanin MICs are 16 to 32 mg/liter have been reported, but cross-resistance between these glycopeptides varies. The selective advantage accorded to glycopeptide-resistant bacteria and the observation that high-level resistance in enterococci is transferable suggest that such resistance may be expected to increase in incidence. Clinicians and microbiologists need to be aware of this emerging problem.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Covering: up to 2014. Dithiolopyrrolone (DTP) group antibiotics were first isolated in the early half of the 20th century, but only recently has research been reawakened by insights gained from the synthesis and biosynthesis of this structurally intriguing class of molecules. DTPs are characterized by an electronically unique bicyclic structure, which contains a compact disulfide bridge between two ene-thiols. Points of diversity within the compound class occur outside of the bicyclic core, at the two amide nitrogens. Such modifications distinguish three of the most well studied members of the class, holomycin, thiolutin, and aureothricin; the DTP core has also more recently been identified in the marine antibiotic thiomarinol, in which it is linked to a marinolic acid moiety, analog of the FDA-approved topical antibiotic BactrobanÂ® (GlaxoSmithKline). Dithiolopyrrolones exhibit relatively broad-spectrum antibiotic activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Additionally, they have been shown to exhibit potent and selective anti-cancer activity. Despite this promising profile, there is still much unknown about the mechanisms of action for DTPs. Early reports suggested that they inhibit yeast growth at the level of transcription and that this effect is largely responsible for their distinctive microbial static properties; a similar mechanism is supported in bacteria. Elucidation of biosynthetic pathways for holomycin in Streptomyces clavuligerus and Yersinia ruckeri and thiomarinol in Alteromonas rava sp. nov. SANK 73390, have contributed evidence suggesting that multiple mechanisms may be operative in the activity of these compounds. This review will comprehensively cover the history and development of dithiolopyrrolones with particular emphasis on the biosynthesis, synthesis, biological activity and mechanism of action.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Glycopeptides and Î²-lactams inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria; resistance to these antibiotics is studied intensively in enterococci and staphylococci because of their relevance to infectious disease. Much less is known about antibiotic resistance in glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes that are likely to represent the evolutionary source of resistance determinants found in bacterial pathogens. Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727, the producer of A40926 (the precursor for the semisynthetic dalbavancin), does not harbor the canonical vanHAX genes. Consequently, we investigated the role of the Î²-lactam-sensitive D,D-peptidase/D,D-carboxypeptidase encoded by vanYn, the only van-like gene found in the A40926 biosynthetic gene cluster, in conferring immunity to the antibiotic in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727. Taking advantage of the tools developed recently to genetically manipulate this uncommon actinomycete, we varied vanYn gene dosage and expressed vanHatAatXat from the teicoplanin producer Actinoplanes teichomyceticus in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727. Knocking out vanYn, complementing a vanYn mutant, or duplicating vanYn had no effect on growth but influenced antibiotic resistance and, in the cases of complementation and duplication, antibiotic production. Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 was found to be resistant to penicillins, but its glycopeptide resistance was diminished in the presence of penicillin G, which inhibits VanYn activity. The heterologous expression of vanHatAatXat increased A40926 resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 but did not increase antibiotic production, indicating that the level of antibiotic production is not directly determined by the level of resistance. The vanYn-based self-resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 resembles the glycopeptide resistance mechanism described recently in mutants of Enterococcus faecium selected in vitro for high-level resistance to glycopeptides and penicillins.",

These compounds act as bisintercalators into the DNA helix. They give rise to antitumor, antiparasitic, antibacterial and antiviral bioactivities. These compounds show a high degree of conserved modularity (chromophores, number and type of amino acids). This modularity and their high sequence similarities at the genetic level imply a common biosynthetic origin for these pathways. Here, we describe insights about rules governing this modular biosynthesis, taking advantage of the fact that nowadays five of these gene clusters have been made public (thiocoraline, triostin, SW-163 and echinomycin/quinomycin). This modularity has potential application for designing and producing novel genetic engineered derivatives, as well as for developing new chemical synthesis strategies. These would facilitate their clinical development.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Transportation of low molecular weight cargoes into the plant vacuole represents an essential plant cell function. Several lines of evidence indicate that autophagy-related direct endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to vacuole (and also, apoplast) transport plays here a more general role than expected. This route is regulated by autophagy proteins, including recently discovered involvement of the exocyst subcomplex. Traffic from ER into the vacuole bypassing Golgi apparatus (GA) acts not only in stress-related cytoplasm recycling or detoxification, but also in developmentally-regulated biopolymer and secondary metabolite import into the vacuole (or apoplast), exemplified by storage proteins and anthocyanins. We propose that this pathway is relevant also for some phytohormones' (e.g., auxin, abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA)) degradation. We hypothesize that SA is not only an autophagy inducer, but also a cargo for autophagy-related ER to vacuole membrane container delivery and catabolism. ER membrane localized enzymes will potentially enhance the area of biosynthetic reactive surfaces, and also, abundant ER localized membrane importers (e.g., ABC transporters) will internalize specific molecular species into the autophagosome biogenesis domain of ER. Such active ER domains may create tubular invaginations of tonoplast into the vacuoles as import intermediates. Packaging of cargos into the ER-derived autophagosome-like containers might be an important mechanism of vacuole and exosome biogenesis and cytoplasm protection against toxic metabolites. A new perspective on metabolic transformations intimately linked to membrane trafficking in plants is emerging.",

Recently, these actinobacteria were shown to harbor self-resistance properties to salinosporamide A by expressing redundant catalytically active mutants of the 20S proteasome Î²-subunit, reminiscent of PSMB5 mutations identified in cancer cells with acquired resistance to the founding proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ). Here, we assessed the growth inhibitory potential of salinosporamide A in human acute lymphocytic leukemia CCRF-CEM cells, and its 10-fold (CEM/BTZ7) and 123-fold (CEM/BTZ200) bortezomib-resistant sublines harboring PSMB5 mutations. Parental cells displayed sensitivity to salinosporamide A (IC50 = 5.1 nM), whereas their bortezomib-resistant sublines were 9- and 17-fold cross-resistant to salinosporamide A, respectively. Notably, combination experiments of salinosporamide A and bortezomib showed synergistic activity in CEM/BTZ200 cells. CEM cells gradually exposed to 20 nM salinosporamide A (CEM/S20) displayed stable 5-fold acquired resistance to salinosporamide A and were 3-fold cross-resistant to bortezomib. Consistent with the acquisition of a PSMB5 point mutation (M45V) in CEM/S20 cells, salinosporamide A displayed a markedly impaired capacity to inhibit Î²5-associated catalytic activity. Last, compared with parental CEM cells, CEM/S20 cells exhibited up to 2.5-fold upregulation of constitutive proteasome subunits, while retaining unaltered immunoproteasome subunit expression. In conclusion, salinosporamide A displayed potent antileukemic activity against bortezomib-resistant leukemia cells. Î²-Subunit point mutations as a common feature of acquired resistance to salinosporamide A and bortezomib in hematologic cells and S. tropica suggest an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of resistance to proteasome inhibitors.",

Depletion of the susceptible high-affinity precursors is catalyzed by the zinc-dependent D,D-peptidases VanX and VanY acting on dipeptide (D-Ala-D-Ala) or pentapeptide (UDP-MurNac-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala), respectively. Some of the vancomycin resistance operons encode VanXY D,D-carboxypeptidase, which hydrolyzes both di- and pentapeptide. The molecular basis for the diverse specificity of Van D,D-peptidases remains unknown. We present the crystal structures of VanXYC and VanXYG in apo and transition state analog-bound forms and of VanXYC in complex with the D-Ala-D-Ala substrate and D-Ala product. Structural and biochemical analysis identified the molecular determinants of VanXY dual specificity. VanXY residues 110-115 form a mobile cap over the catalytic site, whose flexibility is involved in the switch between di- and pentapeptide hydrolysis. Structure-based alignment of the Van D,D-peptidases showed that VanY enzymes lack this element, which promotes binding of the penta- rather than that of the dipeptide. The structures also highlight the molecular basis for selection of D-Ala-ending precursors over the modified resistance targets. These results illustrate the remarkable adaptability of the D,D-peptidase fold in response to antibiotic pressure via evolution of specific structural elements that confer hydrolytic activity against vancomycin-susceptible peptidoglycan precursors.",

By whole-genome sequencing of strain ATCC 29059, we identified a candidate gene that encodes an ATP-binding cassette protein similar to the Lsa and VmlR resistance determinants. Isolation and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) expression studies confirmed that Sal(A) can confer a moderate resistance to lincosamides (8 times the MIC of lincomycin) and a high-level resistance to streptogramins A (64 times the MIC of pristinamycin II). The chromosomal location of sal(A) between two housekeeping genes of the staphylococcal core genome supports the gene's ancient origins and thus innate resistance to these antimicrobials within S. sciuri subspecies.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The soil bacterium Streptomyces peucetius produces two widely used anticancer antibiotics, doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Present within the biosynthesis gene cluster in S. peucetius is the drrAB operon, which codes for a dedicated ABC (ATP binding cassette)-type transporter for the export of these two closely related antibiotics. Because of its dedicated nature, the DrrAB system is believed to belong to the category of single-drug transporters. However, whether it also contains specificity for other known substrates of multidrug transporters has never been tested. In this study we demonstrate under both in vivo and in vitro conditions that the DrrAB system can transport not only doxorubicin but is also able to export two most commonly studied MDR substrates, Hoechst 33342 and ethidium bromide. Moreover, we demonstrate that many other substrates (including verapamil, vinblastine, and rifampicin) of the well studied multidrug transporters inhibit DrrAB-mediated Dox transport with high efficiency, indicating that they are also substrates of the DrrAB pump. Kinetic studies show that inhibition of doxorubicin transport by Hoechst 33342 and rifampicin occurs by a competitive mechanism, whereas verapamil inhibits transport by a non-competitive mechanism, thus suggesting the possibility of more than one drug binding site in the DrrAB system. This is the first in-depth study of a drug resistance system from a producer organism, and it shows that a dedicated efflux system like DrrAB contains specificity for multiple drugs. The significance of these findings in evolution of poly-specificity in drug resistance systems is discussed.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Frequent use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Lantibiotic compounds are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides against which bacteria are not able to produce resistance, hence making them a good alternative to antibiotics. Nisin is the oldest and the most widely used lantibiotic, in food preservation, without having developed any significant resistance against it. Having their antimicrobial potential and a limited number, there is a need to identify novel lantibiotics.<h4>Methodology/findings</h4>Identification of novel lantibiotic biosynthetic clusters from an ever increasing database of bacterial genomes, can provide a major lead in this direction. In order to achieve this, a strategy was adopted to identify novel lantibiotic biosynthetic clusters by screening the sequenced genomes for LanT homolog, which is a conserved lantibiotic transporter specific to type IB clusters. This strategy resulted in identification of 54 bacterial strains containing the LanT homologs, which are not the known lantibiotic producers. Of these, 24 strains were subjected to a detailed bioinformatic analysis to identify genes encoding for precursor peptides, modification enzyme, immunity and quorum sensing proteins. Eight clusters having two LanM determinants, similar to haloduracin and lichenicidin were identified, along with 13 clusters having a single LanM determinant as in mersacidin biosynthetic cluster. Besides these, orphan LanT homologs were also identified which might be associated with novel bacteriocins, encoded somewhere else in the genome. Three identified gene clusters had a C39 domain containing LanT transporter, associated with the LanBC proteins and double glycine type precursor peptides, the only known example of such a cluster is that of salivaricin.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study led to the identification of 8 novel putative two-component lantibiotic clusters along with 13 having a single LanM and 3 with LanBC genes. Putative lantibiotic clusters identified here hold the potential for the discovery of novel lantibiotic(s).",

We previously characterized the PTM and PTN biosynthetic machineries in the Streptomyces platensis producers. We now identify two mechanisms for PTM and PTN resistance in the S. platensis producers-the ptmP3 or ptnP3 gene within the PTM-PTN or PTN biosynthetic cluster and the fabF gene within the fatty acid synthase locus. PtmP3/PtnP3 and FabF confer PTM and PTN resistance by target replacement and target modification, respectively. PtmP3/PtnP3 also represents an unprecedented mechanism for fatty acid biosynthesis in which FabH and FabF are functionally replaced by a single condensing enzyme.

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Despite encouraging results with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, emergence of resistance can limit its efficacy, hence calling for novel strategies to overcome bortezomib-resistance. We previously showed that bortezomib-resistant human leukemia cell lines expressed significantly lower levels of immunoproteasome at the expense of constitutive proteasomes, which harbored point mutations in exon 2 of the PSMB5 gene encoding the Î²5 subunit. Here we investigated whether up-regulation of immunoproteasomes by exposure to interferon-Î³ restores sensitivity to bortezomib in myeloma and leukemia cell lines with acquired resistance to bortezomib.<h4>Methods</h4>RPMI-8226 myeloma, THP1 monocytic/macrophage and CCRF-CEM (T) parental cells and sub lines with acquired resistance to bortezomib were exposed to Interferon-Î³ for 24-48 h where after the effects on proteasome subunit expression and activity were measured, next to sensitivity measurements to proteasome inhibitors bortezomib, carfilzomib, and the immunoproteasome selective inhibitor ONX 0914. At last, siRNA knockdown experiments of Î²5i and Î²1i were performed to identify the contribution of these subunits to sensitivity to proteasome inhibition. Statistical significance of the differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test.<h4>Results</h4>Interferon-Î³ exposure markedly increased immunoproteasome subunit mRNA to a significantly higher level in bortezomib-resistant cells (up to 30-fold, 10-fold, and 6-fold, in Î²1i, Î²5i, and Î²2i, respectively) than in parental cells. These increases were paralleled by elevated immunoproteasome protein levels and catalytic activity, as well as HLA class-I. Moreover, interferon-Î³ exposure reinforced sensitization of bortezomib-resistant tumor cells to bortezomib and carfilzomib, but most prominently to ONX 0914, as confirmed by cell growth inhibition studies, proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis, activation of PARP cleavage and accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. This sensitization was abrogated by siRNA silencing of Î²5i but not by Î²1i silencing, prior to pulse exposure to interferon-Î³.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Downregulation of Î²5i subunit expression is a major determinant in acquisition of bortezomib-resistance and enhancement of its proteasomal assembly after induction by interferon-Î³ facilitates restoration of sensitivity in bortezomib-resistant leukemia cells towards bortezomib and next generation (immuno) proteasome inhibitors.",

The enzyme is often upregulated in cancer cells, and it is a target for chemotherapeutic drugs of the camptothecin (CPT) family. Response to CPT-based treatment is dependent on hTopI activity, and reduction in activity, and mutations in hTopI have been reported to result in CPT resistance. Therefore, hTOPI gene copy number, mRNA level, protein amount, and enzyme activity have been studied to explain differences in cellular response to CPT. We show that Rolling Circle Enhanced Enzyme Activity Detection (REEAD), allowing measurement of hTopI cleavage-religation activity at the single molecule level, may be used to detect posttranslational enzymatic differences influencing CPT response. These differences cannot be detected by analysis of hTopI gene copy number, mRNA amount, or protein amount, and only become apparent upon measuring the activity of hTopI in the presence of CPT. Furthermore, we detected differences in the activity of the repair enzyme tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1, which is involved in repair of hTopI-induced DNA damage. Since increased TDP1 activity can reduce cellular CPT sensitivity we suggest that a combined measurement of TDP1 activity and hTopI activity in presence of CPT will be the best determinant for CPT response.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors ending in D-lactate (D-Lac) is thought to be responsible for glycopeptide resistance in members of the order Actinomycetales that produce these drugs and in related soil bacteria. More recently, the peptidoglycan of several members of the order Actinomycetales was shown to be cross-linked by L,D-transpeptidases that use tetrapeptide acyl donors devoid of the target of glycopeptides. To evaluate the contribution of these resistance mechanisms, we have determined the peptidoglycan structure of Streptomyces coelicolor A(3)2, which harbors a vanHAX gene cluster for the production of precursors ending in D-Lac, and Nonomuraea sp. strain ATCC 39727, which is devoid of vanHAX and produces the glycopeptide A40296. Vancomycin retained residual activity against S. coelicolor A(3)2 despite efficient incorporation of D-Lac into cytoplasmic precursors. This was due to a D,D-transpeptidase-catalyzed reaction that generated a stem pentapeptide recognized by glycopeptides by the exchange of D-Lac for D-Ala and Gly. The contribution of L,D-transpeptidases to resistance was limited by the supply of tetrapeptide acyl donors, which are essential for the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links by these enzymes. In the absence of a cytoplasmic metallo-D,D-carboxypeptidase, the tetrapeptide substrate was generated by hydrolysis of the C-terminal D-Lac residue of the stem pentadepsipeptide in the periplasm in competition with the exchange reaction catalyzed by D,D-transpeptidases. In Nonomuraea sp. strain ATCC 39727, the contribution of L,D-transpeptidases to glycopeptide resistance was limited by the incomplete conversion of pentapeptides into tetrapeptides despite the production of a cytoplasmic metallo-D,D-carboxypeptidase. Since the level of drug production exceeds the level of resistance, we propose that L,D-transpeptidases merely act as a tolerance mechanism in this bacterium.",

It features a rare amino acid, Î²-methylarginine, which is attached to the deoxyhexose moiety via a 4'-aminoacyl bond. We here report cloning of the complete biosynthetic gene cluster for arginomycin from Streptomyces arginensis NRRL 15941. Among the 14 putative essential open reading frames, argM, encoding an aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), and adjacent argN, encoding an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, are coupled to catalyze arginine and yield Î²-methylarginine in Escherichia coli. Purified ArgM can transfer the Î±-amino group of l-arginine to Î±-ketoglutaric acid to give glutamate and thereby converts l-arginine to 5-guanidino-2-oxopentanoic acid, which is methylated at the C-3 position by ArgN to form 5-guanidino-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid. Iteratively, ArgM specifically catalyzes transamination from the donor l-aspartate to the resulting 5-guanidino-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid, generating Î²-methylarginine. The complete and concise biosynthetic pathway for the rare and bioactive amino acid revealed by this study may pave the way for the production of Î²-methylarginine either by enzymatic conversion or by engineered living cells.",

While reliable structural prediction based on cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster sequence was not always possible due to noncanonical domains and/or module organization of a deduced biosynthetic pathway, a molecular genetic method was often employed to detect or alter the expression level of the gene cluster to achieve an observable phenotype, which facilitated downstream natural product purification and identification.

Their unique Î±',Î²'-epoxyketone pharmacophore allows binding to the catalytic Î²-subunits of the proteasome with extraordinary specificity. Here, we report the characterization of the first gene clusters for the biosynthesis of natural peptidyl-epoxyketones. The clusters for epoxomicin, the lead compound for the anticancer drug Kyprolis, and for eponemycin were identified in the actinobacterial producer strains ATCC 53904 and Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC 53709, respectively, using a modified protocol for Ion Torrent PGM genome sequencing. Both gene clusters code for a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase multifunctional enzyme complex and homologous redox enzymes. Epoxomicin and eponemycin were heterologously produced in Streptomyces albus J1046 via whole pathway expression. Moreover, we employed mass spectral molecular networking for a new comparative metabolomics approach in a heterologous system and discovered a number of putative epoxyketone derivatives. With this study, we have definitively linked epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors and their biosynthesis genes for the first time in any organism, which will now allow for their detailed biochemical investigation.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Competition between bacteria for habitat and resources is very common in the natural environment and is considered to be a selective force for survival. Many strains of the genus Pseudoalteromonas were confirmed to produce bioactive compounds that provide those advantages over their competitors. In our previous study, P. flavipulchra JG1 was found to synthesize a Pseudoalteromonas flavipulchra antibacterial Protein (PfaP) with L-amino acid oxidase activity and five small chemical compounds, which were the main competitive agents of the strain. In addition, the genome of this bacterium has been previously sequenced as Whole Genome Shotgun project (PMID: 22740664). In this study, more extensive genomic analysis was performed to identify specific genes or gene clusters which related to its competitive feature, and further experiments were carried out to confirm the physiological roles of these genes when competing with other microorganisms in marine environment.<h4>Results</h4>The antibacterial protein PfaP may also participate in the biosynthesis of 6-bromoindolyl-3-acetic acid, indicating a synergistic effect between the antibacterial macromolecule and small molecules. Chitinases and quorum quenching enzymes present in P. flavipulchra, which coincide with great chitinase and acyl homoserine lactones degrading activities of strain JG1, suggest other potential mechanisms contribute to antibacterial/antifungal activities. Moreover, movability and rapid response mechanisms to phosphorus starvation and other stresses, such as antibiotic, oxidative and heavy metal stress, enable JG1 to adapt to deleterious, fluctuating and oligotrophic marine environments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The genome of P. flavipulchra JG1 exhibits significant genetic advantages against other microorganisms, encoding antimicrobial agents as well as abilities to adapt to various adverse environments. Genes involved in synthesis of various antimicrobial substances enriches the antagonistic mechanisms of P. flavipulchra JG1 and affords several admissible biocontrol procedures in aquaculture. Furthermore, JG1 also evolves a range of mechanisms adapting the adverse marine environment or multidrug rearing conditions. The analysis of the genome of P. flavipulchra JG1 provides a better understanding of its competitive properties and also an extensive application prospect.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Although numerous marine bacteria are known to produce antibiotics via hybrid NRPS-PKS gene clusters, none have been previously described in anÂ AlteromonasÂ species. In this study, we describe in detail a novel hybrid NRPS-PKS cluster identified in the plasmid of theÂ Alteromonasmacleodii strain AltDE1 and analyze its relatedness to other similar gene clusters in a sequence-based characterization. This is a mobile cluster, flanked by transposase-like genes, that has even been found inserted into the chromosome of some Alteromonasmacleodii strains. The cluster contains separate genes for NRPS and PKS activity. The sole PKS gene appears to carry a novel acyltransferase domain, quite divergent from those currently characterized. The predicted specificities of the adenylation domains of the NRPS genes suggest that the final compound has a backbone very similar to bleomycin related compounds. However, the lack of genes involved in sugar biosynthesis indicates that the final product is not a glycopeptide. Even in the absence of these genes, the presence of the cluster appears to confer complete or partial resistance to phleomycin, which may be attributed to a bleomycin-resistance-like protein identified within the cluster. This also suggests that the compound still shares significant structural similarity to bleomycin. Moreover, transcriptomic evidence indicates that the NRPS-PKS cluster is expressed. Such sequence-based approaches will be crucial to fully explore and analyze the diversity and potential of secondary metabolite production, especially from increasingly important sources like marine microbes.",

The sequence selectivity of Top1 inhibitors is important for targeting specific genomic sequences of therapeutic value. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this selectivity remain largely unknown. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to delineate structural, dynamic and energetic features that contribute to the differential sequence selectivity of the Top1 inhibitors. We found the sequence selectivity of CPT to be highly correlated with the drug binding energies, dynamic and structural properties of the linker domain. Chemical insights, gained by per-residue binding energy analysis revealed that the non-polar interaction between CPT and nucleotide at the +1 position of the cleavage site was the major (favorable) contributor to the total binding energy. Mechanistic insights gained by a potential of mean force analysis implicated that the drug dissociation step was associated with the sequence selectivity. Pharmaceutical insights gained by our molecular dynamics analyses explained why LMP-776, an indenoisoquinoline derivative under clinical development at the National Institutes of Health, displays different sequence selectivity when compared with camptothecin and its clinical derivatives.",

We previously described the camptothecin-resistant colon cancer cell line DLDSNR6, which has a Gly365Ser missense mutation in Top1. In the present study, we established highly camptothecin-resistant sublines from DLDSNR6 cells by continuous exposure to higher camptothecin concentrations. The established sublines grew in the presence of 30 ÂµM of camptothecin, but exhibited markedly retarded growth. In addition to Gly365Ser, these sublines harbored a Top1 Gly717Arg mutation and some had also a Top1 Gln421Arg mutation. Top1 activity was reduced to approximately one-eighth in highly resistant cell lines compared with that in parental DLD-1 cells. Resistant clones with 3 Top1 mutations including Gln421RArg exhibited the highest resistance to the indolocarbazole J-107088 in terms of the effect on the cell cycle distribution. The Gln421 mutation was equivalent to a mutation recently found in camptothecin biosynthesizing plants, but it has not previously been found in mammalian cells.",

We isolated a new class of FabI inhibitor from Penicillium chrysogenum, which produces various antibiotics, the mechanisms of some of them are unknown. The isolated FabI inhibitor was determined to be meleagrin by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral analyses, and its more active and inactive derivatives were chemically prepared. Consistent with their selective inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus FabI, meleagrin and its more active derivatives directly bound to S. aureus FabI in a fluorescence quenching assay, inhibited intracellular fatty acid biosynthesis and growth of S. aureus, and increased the minimum inhibitory concentration for fabI-overexpressing S. aureus. The compounds that were not effective against the FabK isoform, however, inhibited the growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae that contained only the FabK isoform. Additionally no resistant mutant to the compounds was obtained. Importantly, fabK-overexpressing Escherichia coli was not resistant to these compounds, but was resistant to triclosan. These results demonstrate that the compounds inhibited another target in addition to FabI. Thus, meleagrin is a new class of FabI inhibitor with at least one additional mode of action that could have potential for treating multidrug-resistant bacteria.",

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has played an important role in our understanding of the structural and chemical complexity of the cell wall by providing an analytical method to quantify differences in chemical composition. Here, we present a primer on the basic chemical features of wall structure that can be revealed through HPLC, along with a description of the applications of HPLC PG analyses for interpreting the effects of genetic and chemical perturbations to a variety of bacterial species in different environments. We describe the physical consequences of different PG compositions on cell shape, and review complementary experimental and computational methodologies for PG analysis.

        "pmc_abstract": "In the low-G+C-content Gram-positive bacteria, resistance to antimicrobial peptides is often mediated by so-called resistance modules. These consist of a two-component system and an ATP-binding cassette transporter and are characterized by an unusual mode of signal transduction where the transporter acts as a sensor of antimicrobial peptides, because the histidine kinase alone cannot detect the substrates directly. Thus, the transporters fulfill a dual function as sensors and detoxification systems to confer resistance, but the mechanistic details of these processes are unknown. The paradigm and best-understood example for this is the BceRS-BceAB module of Bacillus subtilis, which mediates resistance to bacitracin, mersacidin, and actagardine. Using a random mutagenesis approach, we here show that mutations that affect specific functions of the transporter BceAB are primarily found in the C-terminal region of the permease, BceB, particularly in the eighth transmembrane helix. Further, we show that while signaling and resistance are functionally interconnected, several mutations could be identified that strongly affected one activity of the transporter but had only minor effects on the other. Thus, a partial genetic separation of the two properties could be achieved by single amino acid replacements, providing first insights into the signaling mechanism of these unusual modules.",

Acetylaranotin belongs to one structural subgroup of ETPs characterized by the presence of a seven-membered 4,5-dihydrooxepine ring. Defining the genes involved in acetylaranotin biosynthesis should provide a means to increase the production of these compounds and facilitate the engineering of second-generation molecules. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus terreus produces acetylaranotin and related natural products. Using targeted gene deletions, we have identified a cluster of nine genes (including one nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene, ataP) that is required for acetylaranotin biosynthesis. Chemical analysis of the wild-type and mutant strains enabled us to isolate 17 natural products from the acetylaranotin biosynthesis pathway. Nine of the compounds identified in this study are natural products that have not been reported previously. Our data have allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for acetylaranotin and related natural products.",

To date, there are approximately 30 naturally occurring dithiolopyrrolone compounds, including holomycin, thiolutin, and aureothricin, and more recently thiomarinols, a unique class of hybrid marine bacterial natural products containing a dithiolopyrrolone framework linked by an amide bridge with an 8-hydroxyoctanoyl chain linked to a monic acid. Generally, dithiolopyrrolone antibiotics have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against various microorganisms, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and even parasites. Holomycin appeared to be active against rifamycin-resistant bacteria and also inhibit the growth of the clinical pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus N315. Its mode of action is believed to inhibit RNA synthesis although the exact mechanism has yet to be established in vitro. A recent work demonstrated that the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri employs an RNA methyltransferase for self-resistance during the holomycin production. Moreover, some dithiolopyrrolone derivatives have demonstrated promising antitumor activities. The biosynthetic gene clusters of holomycin have recently been identified in S. clavuligerus and characterized biochemically and genetically. The biosynthetic gene cluster of thiomarinol was also identified from the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SANK 73390, which was uniquely encoded by two independent pathways for pseudomonic acid and pyrrothine in a novel plasmid. The aim of this review is to give an overview about the isolations, characterizations, synthesis, biosynthesis, bioactivities and mode of action of this unique family of dithiolopyrrolone natural products, focusing on the period from 1940s until now.",

        "pmc_abstract": "We have recently cloned a DNA fragment containing a gene cluster that is responsible for the biosynthesis of an antituberculosis antibiotic, D-cycloserine. The gene cluster is composed of 10 open reading frames, designated dcsA to dcsJ. Judging from the sequence similarity between each putative gene product and known proteins, DcsC, which displays high homology to diaminopimelate epimerase, may catalyze the racemization of O-ureidoserine. DcsD is similar to O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, which generates L-cysteine using O-acetyl-L-serine with sulfide, and therefore, DcsD may be a synthase to generate O-ureido-L-serine using O-acetyl-L-serine and hydroxyurea. DcsG, which exhibits similarity to a family of enzymes with an ATP-grasp fold, may be an ATP-dependent synthetase converting O-ureido-D-serine into D-cycloserine. In the present study, to characterize the enzymatic functions of DcsC, DcsD, and DcsG, each protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. The biochemical function of each of the reactions catalyzed by these three proteins was verified by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and, in some cases, mass spectrometry. The results from this study demonstrate that by using a mixture of the three purified enzymes and the two commercially available substrates O-acetyl-L-serine and hydroxyurea, synthesis of D-cycloserine was successfully attained. These in vitro studies yield the conclusion that DcsD and DcsG are necessary for the syntheses of O-ureido-L-serine and D-cycloserine, respectively. DcsD was also able to catalyze the synthesis of L-cysteine when sulfide was added instead of hydroxyurea. Furthermore, the present study shows that DcsG can also form other cyclic d-amino acid analogs, such as D-homocysteine thiolactone.",

The biosynthesis of these secondary products is active in O. pumila hairy roots yet very low in cell suspension culture. Deep transcriptome analysis was conducted in O. pumila hairy roots and cell suspension cultures using the Illumina platform, yielding a total of 2 Gb of sequence for each sample. We generated a hybrid transcriptome assembly of O. pumila using the Illumina-derived short read sequences and conventional Sanger-derived expressed sequence tag clones derived from a full-length cDNA library constructed using RNA from hairy roots. Among 35,608 non-redundant unigenes, 3,649 were preferentially expressed in hairy roots compared with cell suspension culture. Candidate genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway for the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid camptothecin were identified; specifically, genes involved in post-strictosamide biosynthetic events and genes involved in the biosynthesis of anthraquinones and chlorogenic acid. Untargeted metabolomic analysis by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) indicated that most of the proposed intermediates in the camptothecin biosynthetic pathway accumulated in hairy roots in a preferential manner compared with cell suspension culture. In addition, a number of anthraquinones and chlorogenic acid preferentially accumulated in hairy roots compared with cell suspension culture. These results suggest that deep transcriptome and metabolome data sets can facilitate the identification of genes and intermediates involved in the biosynthesis of secondary products including camptothecin in O. pumila.",

Among the >20 classes of one-component systems, the TetR family of regulators (TFRs) are widely associated with antibiotic resistance and the regulation of genes encoding small-molecule exporters. However, TFRs play a much broader role, controlling genes involved in metabolism, antibiotic production, quorum sensing, and many other aspects of prokaryotic physiology. There are several well-established model systems for understanding these important proteins, and structural studies have begun to unveil the mechanisms by which they bind DNA and recognize small-molecule ligands. The sequences for more than 200,000 TFRs are available in the public databases, and genomics studies are identifying their target genes. Three-dimensional structures have been solved for close to 200 TFRs. Comparison of these structures reveals a common overall architecture of nine conserved Î± helices. The most important open question concerning TFR biology is the nature and diversity of their ligands and how these relate to the biochemical processes under their control.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antibiotics have, indeed, altered the course of human history as is evidenced by the increase in human life expectancy since the 1940s. Many of these natural compounds are produced by bacteria that, by necessity, must have efficient self-resistance mechanisms. The methymycin/pikromycin producing species Streptomyces venezuelae, for example, utilizes Î²-glucosylation of its macrolide products to neutralize their effects within the confines of the cell. Once released into the environment, these compounds are activated by the removal of the glucose moiety. In S. venezuelae, the enzyme responsible for removal of the sugar from the parent compound is encoded by the desR gene and referred to as DesR. It is a secreted enzyme containing 828 amino acid residues, and it is known to be a retaining glycosidase. Here, we describe the structure of the DesR/D-glucose complex determined to 1.4-Ã resolution. The overall architecture of the enzyme can be envisioned in terms of three regions: a catalytic core and two auxiliary domains. The catalytic core harbors the binding platform for the glucose ligand. The first auxiliary domain adopts a \"PA14 fold,\" whereas the second auxiliary domain contains an immunoglobulin-like fold. Asp 273 and Glu 578 are in the proper orientation to function as the catalytic base and proton donor, respectively, required for catalysis. The overall fold of the core region places DesR into the GH3 glycoside hydrolase family of enzymes. Comparison of the DesR structure with the Î²-glucosidase from Kluyveromyces marxianus shows that their PA14 domains assume remarkably different orientations.",

We now report (i) the comparison of metabolite profiles of S. sp. 17944 in six different media, (ii) identification of a medium enabling the production of TAM B as essentially the sole metabolite, and with improved titer, and (iii) isolation and structural elucidation of three new TAM congeners. These findings shed new insights into the structure-activity relationship of TAM B as a BmAsnRS inhibitor, highlighting the Î´-hydroxymethyl-Î±,Î²-epoxyketone moiety as the critical pharmacophore, and should greatly facilitate the production and isolation of sufficient quantities of TAM B for further mechanistic and preclinical studies to advance the candidacy of TAM B as an antifilarial drug lead.

        "pmc_abstract": "Holomycin and its derivatives belong to a class of broad-spectrum antibacterial natural products containing a rare dithiolopyrrolone heterobicyclic scaffold. The antibacterial mechanism of dithiolopyrrolone compounds has been attributed to the inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase activities, although the exact mode of action has not been established in vitro. Some dithiopyrrolone derivatives display potent anticancer activities. Recently the biosynthetic gene cluster of holomycin has been identified and characterized in Streptomyces clavuligerus. Here we report that the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri is a holomycin producer, as evidenced through genome mining, chemical isolation, and structural elucidation as well as genetic manipulation. We also identified a unique regulatory gene hom15 at one end of the gene cluster encoding a cold-shock-like protein that likely regulates the production of holomycin in low cultivation temperatures. Inactivation of hom15 resulted in a significant loss of holomycin production. Finally, gene disruption of an RNA methyltransferase gene hom12 resulted in the sensitivity of the mutant toward holomycin. A complementation experiment of hom12 restored the resistance against holomycin. Although the wild-type Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Gold is susceptible to holomycin, the mutant harboring hom12 showed tolerance toward holomycin. High resolution liquid chromatography (LC)-ESI/MS analysis of digested RNA fragments demonstrated that the wild-type Y. ruckeri and E. coli harboring hom12 contain a methylated RNA fragment, whereas the mutated Y. ruckeri and the wild-type E. coli only contain normal non-methylated RNA fragments. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that this putative RNA methyltransferase Hom12 is the self-resistance protein that methylates the RNA of Y. ruckeri to reduce the cytotoxic effect of holomycin during holomycin production.",

For decades, research in bacterial lipid synthesis was largely confined to the Escherichia coli model system. This basic research provided a blueprint for the biochemistry of lipid metabolism that has largely defined the individual steps in bacterial fatty acid and phospholipids synthesis. The advent of genomic sequencing has revealed a surprising amount of diversity in the genes, enzymes and genetic organization of the components responsible for bacterial lipid synthesis. Although the chemical steps in fatty acid synthesis are largely conserved in bacteria, there are surprising differences in the structure and cofactor requirements for the enzymes that perform these reactions in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This review summarizes how the explosion of new information on the diversity of biochemical and genetic regulatory mechanisms has impacted our understanding of bacterial lipid homeostasis. The potential and problems of developing therapeutics that block pathogen phospholipid synthesis are explored and evaluated.

        "pmc_abstract": "The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens has renewed focus on natural products with antimicrobial properties. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics that are posttranslationally modified to introduce (methyl)lanthionine bridges. Actinomycetes are renowned for their ability to produce a large variety of antibiotics, many with clinical applications, but are known to make only a few lantibiotics. One such compound is planosporicin produced by Planomonospora alba, which inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive pathogens. Planosporicin is a type AI lantibiotic structurally similar to those which bind lipid II, the immediate precursor for cell wall biosynthesis. The gene cluster responsible for planosporicin biosynthesis was identified by genome mining and subsequently isolated from a P. alba cosmid library. A minimal cluster of 15 genes sufficient for planosporicin production was defined by heterologous expression in Nonomuraea sp. strain ATCC 39727, while deletion of the gene encoding the precursor peptide from P. alba, which abolished planosporicin production, was also used to confirm the identity of the gene cluster. Deletion of genes encoding likely biosynthetic enzymes identified through bioinformatic analysis revealed that they, too, are essential for planosporicin production in the native host. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that the planosporicin gene cluster is transcribed in three operons. Expression of one of these, pspEF, which encodes an ABC transporter, in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) conferred some degree of planosporicin resistance on the heterologous host. The inability to delete these genes from P. alba suggests that they play an essential role in immunity in the natural producer.",

Twenty of the entire biosynthetic gene clusters for secondary metabolites were successively cloned and introduced into a versatile model host S. avermitilis SUKA17 or 22. Almost all S. avermitilis transformants carrying the entire gene cluster produced metabolites as a result of the expression of biosynthetic gene clusters introduced. A few transformants were unable to produce metabolites, but their production was restored by the expression of biosynthetic genes using an alternative promoter or the expression of a regulatory gene in the gene cluster that controls the expression of biosynthetic genes in the cluster using an alternative promoter. Production of metabolites in some transformants of the versatile host was higher than that of the original producers, and cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters in the original producer were also expressed in a versatile host.",

Here we report that both gene pairs form transcriptional units actively expressed during MmA production phase. Streptomyces ghanaensis mutants deficient in either (one) or both transporter systems are characterized by a decreased ability to produce moenomycins, and the ÎmoeP5moeX5 mutant exported less moenomycins. However, even the quadruple S. ghanaensis mutant (ÎmoeD5moeJ5Â +Â ÎmoeX5moeP5) remains able to extrude significant amounts of moenomycin. Similar results were observed under conditions of heterologous expression of moe cluster. Transporter genes other than those located in moe cluster are likely to participate in moenomycin efflux.",

Our electron microscopical and biochemical studies suggest that droplets contain densely packed vesicles with large assemblies of different protein types and/or the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin. Frozen-hydrated vesicles were unilamellar with a typical bilayer membrane, and ranged from 80 to 400 nm in diameter with a preferred width of 150-300 nm. By means of cryo-electron tomography, three types were reconstructed three-dimensionally: vesicles that were filled with particulate material, likely protein assemblies, those that contained membrane-bound particles, and a vesicle that showed a higher contrast inside, but lacked particles. Our LC/MS analyses of generated tryptic peptides led to the identification of distinct proteins that carry often a predicted N-terminal signal peptide with a twin-arginine motif or lack a canonical signal sequence. The proteins are required for a range of processes: the acquisition of inorganic as well as organic phosphate, iron ions, and of distinct carbon sources, energy metabolism and redox balance, defence against oxidants and tellurites, the tailoring of actinorhodin, folding and assembly of proteins, establishment of turgor, and different signalling cascades. Our novel findings have immense implications for understanding new avenues of environmental biology of streptomycetes and for biotechnological applications.",

However, the search for novel antitumour drugs active against untreatable tumours, with fewer side-effects or with enhanced therapeutic efficiency, is a priority goal in cancer chemotherapy. Microorganisms, particularly actinomycetes, are prolific producers of bioactive compounds, including antitumour drugs, produced as secondary metabolites. Structural genes involved in the biosynthesis of such compounds are normally clustered together with resistance and regulatory genes, which facilitates the isolation of the gene cluster. The characterization of these clusters has represented, during the last 25 years, a great source of genes for the generation of novel derivatives by using combinatorial biosynthesis approaches: gene inactivation, gene expression, heterologous expression of the clusters or mutasynthesis. In addition, these techniques have been also applied to improve the production yields of natural and novel antitumour compounds. In this review we focus on some representative antitumour compounds produced by actinomycetes covering the genetic approaches used to isolate and validate their biosynthesis gene clusters, which finally led to generating novel derivatives and to improving the production yields.",

With advances in sequencing and recombinant DNA technology, many of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for the production of these chemically complex yet valuable compounds have been elucidated. With an ever-expanding toolkit of biosynthetic components, metabolic engineering is an increasingly powerful method to improve natural product titers and generate novel compounds. Heterologous production platforms have enabled access to pathways from difficult to culture strains, systems biology and metabolic modeling tools have resulted in increasing predictive and analytic capabilities, advances in expression systems and regulation have enabled the fine-tuning of pathways for increased efficiency, and characterization of individual pathway components has facilitated the construction of hybrid pathways for the production of new compounds. These advances in the many aspects of metabolic engineering not only have yielded fascinating scientific discoveries but also make it an increasingly viable approach for the optimization of natural product biosynthesis.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Streptomyces griseus, a well-known industrial producer of streptomycin, is a member of the genus Streptomyces, which shows a complex life cycle resembling that of fungi. A-factor, a C13 Î³-butyrolactone compound, was discovered as a self-regulatory factor or a bacterial hormone to induce morphological differentiation and production of secondary metabolites, including streptomycin, in this organism. Accumulating evidence has revealed an A-factor-triggered signal cascade, which is composed of several key steps or components. These include: (i) AfsA catalyzing a crucial step of A-factor biosynthesis, (ii) the A-factor-specific receptor (ArpA), which acts as a transcriptional repressor for adpA, (iii) adpA, a sole target of ArpA, which encodes a global transcriptional activator AdpA, and (iv) a variety of members of the AdpA regulon, a set of the genes regulated by AdpA. A-factor is biosynthesized via five reaction steps, in which AfsA catalyzes acyl transfer between a Î²-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein and the hydroxyl group of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The receptor ArpA, belonging to the TetR family, is a homodimer, each subunit of which contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and an A-factor-binding pocket. The three-dimensional structure and conformational change upon binding A-factor are elucidated, on the basis of X-ray crystallography of CprB, an ArpA homologue. AdpA, belonging to the AraC/XylS transcriptional activator family, binds operators upstream from the promoters of a variety of the target genes and activates their transcription, thus forming the AdpA regulon. Members of the AdpA regulon includes the pathway-specific transcriptional activator gene strR that activates the whole streptomycin biosynthesis gene cluster, in addition to a number of genes that direct the multiple cellular functions required for cellular differentiation in a concerted manner. A variety of A-factor homologues as well as homologues of afsA/arpA are distributed widely among Streptomyces, indicating the significant role of this type of molecular signaling in the ecosystem and evolutional processes.",

Here, we report the gene cloning and functional characterization in Escherichia coli of LmrA, a lactococcal structural and functional homolog of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1. LmrA is a 590-aa polypeptide that has a putative topology of six alpha-helical transmembrane segments in the N-terminal hydrophobic domain, followed by a hydrophilic domain containing the ATP-binding site. LmrA is similar to each of the two halves of MDR1 and may function as a homodimer. The sequence conservation between LmrA and MDR1 includes particular regions in the transmembrane domains and connecting loops, which, in MDR1 and the MDR1 homologs in other mammalian species, have been implicated as determinants of drug recognition and binding. LmrA and MDR1 extrude a similar spectrum of amphiphilic cationic compounds, and the activity of both systems is reversed by reserpine and verapamil. As LmrA can be functionally expressed in E. coli, it offers a useful prokaryotic model for future studies on the molecular mechanism of MDR1-like multidrug transporters.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are natural products found across diverse taxa as part of the innate immune system against pathogen attacks. Some AMPs are synthesized through the canonical gene expression machinery and are called ribosomal AMPs. Other AMPs are assembled by modular enzymes generating nonribosomal AMPs and harbor unusual structural diversity. Plants synthesize an array of AMPs, yet are still subject to many pathogen invasions. Crop breeding programs struggle to release new cultivars in which complete disease resistance is achieved, and usually such resistance becomes quickly overcome by the targeted pathogens which have a shorter generation time. AMPs could offer a solution by exploring not only plant-derived AMPs, related or unrelated to the crop of interest, but also non-plant AMPs produced by bacteria, fungi, oomycetes or animals. This review highlights some promising candidates within the plant kingdom and elsewhere, and offers some perspectives on how to identify and validate their bioactivities. Technological advances, particularly in mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), have been instrumental in identifying and elucidating the structure of novel AMPs, especially nonribosomal peptides which cannot be identified through genomics approaches. The majority of non-plant AMPs showing potential for plant disease immunity are often tested using in vitro assays. The greatest challenge remains the functional validation of candidate AMPs in plants through transgenic experiments, particularly introducing nonribosomal AMPs into crops.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The photoactivated toxin, cercosporin, produced by Cercospora species, plays an important role in pathogenesis of this fungus to host plants. Cercosporin has almost universal toxicity to cells due to its production of reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen. For that reason, Cercospora species, which are highly resistant to their own toxin, are good candidates to identify genes for resistance to cercosporin and to the reactive oxygen species it produces. In previous research, the zinc cluster transcription factor CRG1 (cercosporin resistance gene 1) was found to be crucial for Cercospora species' resistance against cercosporin, and subtractive hybridization analysis identified 185 genes differentially expressed between Cercospora nicotianae wild type (wt) and a crg1 mutant. The focus of this work was to identify and characterize the hypothetical proteins that were identified in the Cercospora nicotianae subtractive library as potential resistance factors. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the 20 genes encoding hypothetical proteins showed that two, 24cF and 71cR, were induced under conditions of cercosporin toxicity, suggesting a role in resistance. Transformation and expression of 24cF and 71cR in the cercosporin-sensitive fungus, Neurospora crassa, showed that 71cR provided increased resistance to cercosporin toxicity, whereas no significant increase was observed in 24cF transformants. Gene disruption was used to generate C. nicotianae 71cR mutants; these mutants did not differ from wt C. nicotianae in cercosporin resistance or production. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed induction of other resistance genes in the 71cR mutant that may compensate for the loss of 71cR. Analysis of 71cR conserved domains and secondary and tertiary structure identify the protein as having an NTF2-like superfamily DUF1348 domain with unknown function, to be intracellular and localized in the cytosol, and to have similarities to proteins in the steroid delta-isomerase family.",

However, the role of LDs in resistance to toxins in fungi remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the trapping of endogenous toxins by LDs is a self-resistance mechanism in the toxin producer, while absorbing external lipophilic toxins is a resistance mechanism in the toxin recipient that acts to quench the production of reactive oxygen species. We found that an endolichenic fungus that generates phototoxic perylenequinones (PQs) trapped the PQs inside LDs. Using a model that incorporates the fungicidal action of hypocrellin A (HA), a PQ derivative, we showed that yeast cells escaped killing by trapping toxins inside LDs. Furthermore, LD-deficient mutants were hypersusceptible to HA-mediated phototoxins and other fungicides. Our study identified a previously unrecognised function of LDs in fungi that has implications for our understanding of environmental adaptation strategies for fungi and antifungal drug discovery.",

To decipher the role of the genes adjacent to the structural genes cesA/cesB, coding for the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), gene inactivation- and overexpression mutants of the emetic strain F4810/72 were constructed and their impact on cereulide biosynthesis was assessed. The hydrolase CesH turned out to be a part of the complex regulatory network controlling cereulide synthesis on a transcriptional level, while the ABC transporter CesCD was found to be essential for post-translational control of cereulide synthesis. Using a gene inactivation approach, we show that the NRPS activating function of the phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPtase) embedded in the ces locus was complemented by a chromosomally encoded Sfp-like PPtase, representing an interesting example for the functional interaction between a plasmid encoded NRPS and a chromosomally encoded activation enzyme. In summary, our results highlight the complexity of cereulide biosynthesis and reveal multiple levels of toxin formation control. ces operon internal genes were shown to play a pivotal role by acting at different levels of toxin production, thus complementing the action of the chromosomal key transcriptional regulators AbrB and CodY.",

It is caused by Yersinia ruckeri, a Gram-negative rod-shaped enterobacterium. It has a wide host range, broad geographical distribution, and causes significant economic losses in the fish aquaculture industry. The disease gets its name from the subcutaneous hemorrhages, it can cause at the corners of the mouth and in gums and tongue. Other clinical signs include exophthalmia, darkening of the skin, splenomegaly and inflammation of the lower intestine with accumulation of thick yellow fluid. The bacterium enters the fish via the secondary gill lamellae and from there it spreads to the blood and internal organs. Y. ruckeri can be detected by conventional biochemical, serological and molecular methods. Its genome is 3.7Â Mb with 3406-3530 coding sequences. Several important virulence factors of Y. ruckeri have been discovered, including haemolyin YhlA and metalloprotease Yrp1. Both non-specific and specific immune responses of fish during the course of Y. ruckeri infection have been well characterized. Several methods of vaccination have been developed for controlling both biotype 1 and biotype 2 Y. ruckeri strains in fish.

        "pmc_abstract": "Antimicrobial agents are urgently needed to tackle the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. An important source of new antimicrobials is the large repertoire of cryptic gene clusters embedded in microbial genomes. Genome mining revealed a napsamycin/mureidomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in the chromosome of Streptomyces roseosporus NRRL 15998. The cryptic gene cluster was activated by constitutive expression of a foreign activator gene ssaA from sansanmycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. strain SS. Expression of the gene cluster was verified by RT-PCR analysis of key biosynthetic genes. The activated metabolites demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against the highly refractory pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and characterization of the metabolites led to the discovery of eight acetylated mureidomycin analogues. To our surprise, constitutive expression of the native activator gene SSGG_02995, a ssaA homologue in S. roseosporus NRRL 15998, has no beneficial effect on mureidomycin stimulation. This study provides a new way to activate cryptic gene cluster for the acquisition of novel antibiotics and will accelerate the exploitation of prodigious natural products in Streptomyces.",

In this study, we put four d-CS biosynthetic genes (dcsC, dcsD, dcsE, and dcsG) in tandem under the control of the T7 promoter in an Escherichia coli host. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the 4 gene products were simultaneously expressed in host cells. When l-serine and hydroxyurea (HU), the precursors of d-CS, were incubated together with the E. coli resting cell suspension, the cells produced significant amounts of d-CS (350 Â± 20 Î¼M). To increase the productivity of d-CS, the dcsJ gene, which might be responsible for the d-CS excretion, was connected downstream of the four genes. The E. coli resting cells harboring the five genes produced d-CS at 660 Â± 31 Î¼M. The dcsD gene product, DcsD, forms O-ureido-l-serine from O-acetyl-l-serine (OAS) and HU, which are intermediates in d-CS biosynthesis. DcsD also catalyzes the formation of l-cysteine from OAS and H2S. To repress the side catalytic activity of DcsD, the E. coli chromosomal cysJ and cysK genes, encoding the sulfite reductase Î± subunit and OAS sulfhydrylase, respectively, were disrupted. When resting cells of the double-knockout mutant harboring the four d-CS biosynthetic genes, together with dcsJ, were incubated with l-serine and HU, the d-CS production was 980 Â± 57 Î¼M, which is comparable to that of d-CS-producing S. lavendulae ATCC 11924 (930 Â± 36 Î¼M).",

        "pmc_abstract": "Pseudomonas syringae is a phytopathogenic bacterium widely spread on terrestrial plants. Sulfodiaminophosphinyl tripeptide Phaseolotoxins (PHTs), produced by P. syringae pv. phaseolicola and P. syringae pv. actinidiae, represent a kind of antimetabolic phytotoxins. PHTs inhibit host cell Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTCase) activity and induce Arginine auxotrophic phenotype. The biosynthesis of PHT is temperature dependent, being optically produced at around 18âÂ°C, while blocked above 28âÂ°C. PHT resistant OTCase ArgK acts as a functional replacement of housekeeping OTCase ArgF, which is the acting target of PHT, to confer PHT producers with self-resistance. It was postulated that argK might be regulated directly by a PHT biosynthetic precursor and indirectly by temperature with an unknown manner. Neither transcriptional regulator nor thermal regulation related protein encoding gene was detected from PHT biosynthetic gene cluster. The tripeptide, Cit-Ala-hArg, was identified to be a by-product of PHT biosynthetic pathway in this report. Formation of Cit-Ala-hArg was catalyzed by ArgK with tripeptide Orn-Ala-hArg and carbamyl phosphate as substrates. It showed that ArgK not only provided alternative Arginine source as reported previously, but also controlled the production of PHTs by converting PHT biosynthetic precursors to nontoxic Cit-Ala-hArg reservoir for producers' self-defense.",

Despite the pharmaceutical sector's lack of interest in the topic in the last decade, microbial natural products continue to represent one of the most interesting sources for discovering and developing novel antibacterials. Research in microbial natural product screening and development is currently benefiting from progress that has been made in other related fields (microbial ecology, analytical chemistry, genomics, molecular biology, and synthetic biology).

Here we show that an A. fumigatus ÎgliA strain is completely deficient in gliotoxin secretion but still retains the ability to efflux bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin (BmGT). This correlates with a significant increase in sensitivity to exogenous gliotoxin because gliotoxin trapped inside the cell leads to (i) activation of the gli cluster, as disabling gli cluster activation, via gliZ deletion, attenuates the sensitivity of an A. fumigatus ÎgliT strain to gliotoxin, thus implicating cluster activation as a factor in gliotoxin sensitivity, and (ii) increased methylation activity due to excess substrate (dithiol gliotoxin) for the gliotoxin bis-thiomethyltransferase GtmA. Intracellular dithiol gliotoxin is oxidized by GliT and subsequently effluxed by GliA. In the absence of GliA, gliotoxin persists in the cell and is converted to BmGT, with levels significantly higher than those in the wild type. Similarly, in the ÎgliT strain, gliotoxin oxidation is impeded, and methylation occurs unchecked, leading to significant S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) depletion and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) overproduction. This in turn significantly contributes to the observed hypersensitivity of gliT-deficient A. fumigatus to gliotoxin. Our observations reveal a key role for GliT in preventing dysregulation of the methyl/methionine cycle to control intracellular SAM and SAH homeostasis during gliotoxin biosynthesis and exposure. Moreover, we reveal attenuated GliT abundance in the A. fumigatus ÎgliK strain, but not the ÎgliG strain, following exposure to gliotoxin, correlating with relative sensitivities. Overall, we illuminate new systems interactions that have evolved in gliotoxin-producing, compared to gliotoxin-naive, fungi to facilitate their cellular presence.",

We have solved the structures of the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome with A-, P-, and E-site tRNAs bound and in complex with either the aminocyclitol-containing antibiotic hygromycin A (HygA) or the nucleoside antibiotic A201A. Both antibiotics bind at the peptidyl transferase center and sterically occlude the CCA-end of the A-tRNA from entering the A site of the peptidyl transferase center. Single-molecule FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments reveal that HygA and A201A specifically interfere with full accommodation of the A-tRNA, leading to the presence of tRNA accommodation intermediates and thereby inhibiting peptide bond formation. Thus, our results provide not only insight into the mechanism of action of HygA and A201A, but also into the fundamental process of tRNA accommodation during protein synthesis.",

The high abundance of fungal and bacterial species in these consortia results in specific communication between the microorganisms. A key role in this communication is played by secondary metabolites (SMs), which are also called natural products. Recently, it was shown that interspecies \"talk\" between microorganisms represents a physiological trigger to activate silent gene clusters leading to the formation of novel SMs by the involved species. This review focuses on mixed microbial cultivation, mainly between bacteria and fungi, with a special emphasis on the induced formation of fungal SMs in co-cultures. In addition, the role of chromatin remodeling in the induction is examined, and methodical perspectives for the analysis of natural products are presented. As an example for an intermicrobial interaction elucidated at the molecular level, we discuss the specific interaction between the filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus with the soil bacterium Streptomyces rapamycinicus, which provides an excellent model system to enlighten molecular concepts behind regulatory mechanisms and will pave the way to a novel avenue of drug discovery through targeted activation of silent SM gene clusters through co-cultivations of microorganisms.",

The purpose of this review is to describe the biodiversity of biosynthetic genes of plant-associated bacteria and fungi that encode selected examples of antimicrobial natural products. For each compound, the target pathogen and biochemical mode of action are described, in order to draw attention to the complexity of these phenomena. We review recent information of the underlying molecular diversity and draw lessons through comparative genomic analysis of the orthologous coding sequences (CDS). We conclude by discussing emerging themes and gaps, discuss the metabolic pathways in the context of the phylogeny and ecology of their microbial hosts, and discuss potential evolutionary mechanisms that led to the diversification of biosynthetic gene clusters.",

        "pmc_abstract": "A-500359s, A-503083s, and A-102395 are capuramycin-type nucleoside antibiotics that were discovered using a screen to identify inhibitors of bacterial translocase I, an essential enzyme in peptidoglycan cell wall biosynthesis. Like the parent capuramycin, A-500359s and A-503083s consist of three structural components: a uridine-5'-carboxamide (CarU), a rare unsaturated hexuronic acid, and an aminocaprolactam, the last of which is substituted by an unusual arylamine-containing polyamide in A-102395. The biosynthetic gene clusters for A-500359s and A-503083s have been reported, and two genes encoding a putative non-heme Fe(II)-dependent Î±-ketoglutarate:UMP dioxygenase and an l-Thr:uridine-5'-aldehyde transaldolase were uncovered, suggesting that C-C bond formation during assembly of the high carbon (C6) sugar backbone of CarU proceeds from the precursors UMP and l-Thr to form 5'-C-glycyluridine (C7) as a biosynthetic intermediate. Here, isotopic enrichment studies with the producer of A-503083s were used to indeed establish l-Thr as the direct source of the carboxamide of CarU. With this knowledge, the A-102395 gene cluster was subsequently cloned and characterized. A genetic system in the A-102395-producing strain was developed, permitting the inactivation of several genes, including those encoding the dioxygenase (cpr19) and transaldolase (cpr25), which abolished the production of A-102395, thus confirming their role in biosynthesis. Heterologous production of recombinant Cpr19 and CapK, the transaldolase homolog involved in A-503083 biosynthesis, confirmed their expected function. Finally, a phosphotransferase (Cpr17) conferring self-resistance was functionally characterized. The results provide the opportunity to use comparative genomics along with in vivo and in vitro approaches to probe the biosynthetic mechanism of these intriguing structures.",

Using the optimal conditions, the electroporation efficiency was improved to 1.03 Ã 10(70 transformants/Î¼g of DNA, an approximately 10,000-fold increase in electroporation efficiency. This efficiency is the highest electroporation efficiency for B. subtilis and enables the construction of a directed evolution library or the knockout of a gene in B. subtilis ZK for molecular genetics studies. In the optimization process, the combined effects of three types of wall-weakening agents were evaluated using a response surface methodology (RSM) design, which led to a two orders of magnitude increase in electroporation efficiency. To the best of our limited knowledge, this study provides the first demonstration of using an RSM design for optimization of the electroporation conditions for B. subtilis. To validate the electroporation efficiency, a case study was performed and a gene (rapC) was inactivated in B. subtilis ZK using a suicide plasmid pMUTIN4. Moreover, we found that the rapC mutants exhibited a marked decrease in iturin A production, suggesting that the rapC gene was closely related to the iturin A production.",

The usually aerobic production via fermentation of Bacillus subtilis is accompanied by vigorous foaming which leads to complex constructions and great expense. Therefore it is reasonable to search for alternative foam-free production processes. The current study introduces a novel approach to produce Surfactin in a foam-free process applying a strictly anaerobic bioreactor cultivation. The process was performed several times with different glucose concentrations in mineral salt medium. The fermentations were analyzed regarding specific (qSurfactin, vol. qSurfactin) and overall product yields (YP/X, YP/S) as well as substrate utilization (YX/S). Fermentations in which 2.5Â g/L glucose were employed proofed to be the most effective, reaching product yields of YP/Xâ=â0.278Â g/g. Most interesting, the product yields exceeded classical aerobic fermentations, in which foam fractionation was applied. Additionally, values for specific production rate qSurfactin (0.005Â g/(gâh)) and product yield per consumed substrate (YP/Sâ=â0.033Â g/g) surpass results of comparable foam-free processes. The current study introduces an alternative to produce a biosurfactant that overcomes the challenges of severe foaming and need for additional constructions.",

This strategy takes advantage of the differences in cell proliferation between normal and cancer cells. Chemotherapeutic drugs are usually designed to target rapid-dividing cells because sustained proliferation is a common feature of cancer [1,2]. Rapid DNA replication is essential for highly proliferative cells, thus blocking of DNA replication will create numerous mutations and/or chromosome rearrangements-ultimately triggering cell death [3]. Along these lines, DNA topoisomerase inhibitors are of great interest because they help to maintain strand breaks generated by topoisomerases during replication. In this article, we discuss the characteristics of topoisomerase (DNA) I (TOP1) and its inhibitors, as well as the underlying DNA repair pathways and the use of TOP1 inhibitors in cancer therapy.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) synthesis in fungi requires a ready supply of proteogenic and non-proteogenic amino acids which are subsequently incorporated into the nascent NRP via a thiotemplate mechanism catalyzed by NRP synthetases. Substrate amino acids can be modified prior to or during incorporation into the NRP, or following incorporation into an early stage amino acid-containing biosynthetic intermediate. These post-incorporation modifications involve a range of additional enzymatic activities including but not exclusively, monooxygenases, methyltransferases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and glutathione S-transferases which are essential to effect biosynthesis of the final NRP. Likewise, polyketide biosynthesis is directly by polyketide synthase megaenzymes and cluster-encoded ancillary decorating enzymes. Additionally, a suite of additional primary metabolites, for example: coenzyme A (CoA), acetyl CoA, S-adenosylmethionine, glutathione (GSH), NADPH, malonyl CoA, and molecular oxygen, amongst others are required for NRP and polyketide synthesis (PKS). Clearly these processes must involve exquisite orchestration to facilitate the simultaneous biosynthesis of different types of NRPs, polyketides, and related metabolites requiring identical or similar biosynthetic precursors or co-factors. Moreover, the near identical structures of many natural products within a given family (e.g., ergot alkaloids), along with localization to similar regions within fungi (e.g., conidia) suggests that cross-talk may exist, in terms of biosynthesis and functionality. Finally, we speculate if certain biosynthetic steps involved in NRP and PKS play a role in cellular protection or environmental adaptation, and wonder if these enzymatic reactions are of equivalent importance to the actual biosynthesis of the final metabolite.",

Gene clusters encoding most of the structural complexity of the echinocandins provided a framework for hypotheses about the evolutionary history and chemical logic of echinocandin biosynthesis. Gene orthologs among echinocandin-producing fungi were identified. Pathway genes, including the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), were analyzed phylogenetically to address the hypothesis that these pathways represent descent from a common ancestor. The clusters share cooperative gene contents and linkages among the different strains. Individual pathway genes analyzed in the context of similar genes formed unique echinocandin-exclusive phylogenetic lineages. The echinocandin NRPSs, along with the NRPS from the inp gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans and its orthologs, comprise a novel lineage among fungal NRPSs. NRPS adenylation domains from different species exhibited a one-to-one correspondence between modules and amino acid specificity that is consistent with models of tandem duplication and subfunctionalization. Pathway gene trees and Ascomycota phylogenies are congruent and consistent with the hypothesis that the echinocandin gene clusters have a common origin. The disjunct Eurotiomycete-Leotiomycete distribution appears to be consistent with a scenario of vertical descent accompanied by incomplete lineage sorting and loss of the clusters from most lineages of the Ascomycota. We present evidence for a single evolutionary origin of the echinocandin family of gene clusters and a progression of structural diversification in two fungal classes that diverged approximately 290 to 390 million years ago. Lineage-specific gene cluster evolution driven by selection of new chemotypes contributed to diversification of the molecular functionalities.",

Streptomyces are soil dwelling filamentous bacteria with complex life cycle, studied mostly for they ability to synthesize secondary metabolites including antibiotics.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a systematic approach that analyzes gene expression data obtained from 13 time points taken over 5.5Â h of Streptomyces germination. Genes whose expression was significantly enhanced/diminished during the time-course were identified, and classified to metabolic and regulatory pathways. The classification into metabolic pathways revealed timing of the activation of specific pathways during the course of germination. The analysis also identified remarkable changes in the expression of specific sigma factors over the course of germination. Based on our knowledge of the targets of these factors, we speculate on their possible roles during germination. Among the factors whose expression was enhanced during the initial part of germination, SigE is though to manage cell wall reconstruction, SigR controls protein re-aggregation, and others (SigH, SigB, SigI, SigJ) control osmotic and oxidative stress responses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>From the results, we conclude that most of the metabolic pathway mRNAs required for the initial phases of germination were synthesized during the sporulation process and stably conserved in the spore. After rehydration in growth medium, the stored mRNAs are being degraded and resynthesized during first hour. From the analysis of sigma factors we conclude that conditions favoring germination evoke stress-like cell responses.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a diverse group of biologically active bacterial molecules. Due to the conserved genomic arrangement of many of the genes involved in their synthesis, these secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways can be predicted from genome sequence data. To date, however, despite the myriad of sequenced genomes covering many branches of the bacterial phylogenetic tree, such an analysis for a broader group of bacteria like anaerobes has not been attempted.<h4>Results</h4>We investigated a collection of 211 complete and published genomes, focusing on anaerobic bacteria, whose potential to encode RiPPs is relatively unknown. We showed that the presence of RiPP-genes is widespread among anaerobic representatives of the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and that, collectively, anaerobes possess the ability to synthesize a broad variety of different RiPP classes. More than 25% of anaerobes are capable of producing RiPPs either alone or in conjunction with other secondary metabolites, such as polyketides or non-ribosomal peptides.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Amongst the analyzed genomes, several gene clusters encode uncharacterized RiPPs, whilst others show similarity with known RiPPs. These include a number of potential class II lanthipeptides; head-to-tail cyclized peptides and lactococcin 972-like RiPP. This study presents further evidence in support of anaerobic bacteria as an untapped natural products reservoir.",

This study defines a spectrum of mutations in fabH that render Staphylococcus aureus resistant to multiple natural products known to inhibit the elongation condensing enzyme (FabF) of bacterial type II fatty acid synthesis. Twenty independently isolated clones resistant to platensimycin, platencin, or thiolactomycin were isolated. All mutants selected against one antibiotic were cross-resistant to the other two antibiotics. Mutations were not detected in fabF, but the resistant strains harbored missense mutations in fabH. The altered amino acids clustered in and around the FabH active-site tunnel. The mutant FabH proteins were catalytically compromised based on the low activities of the purified enzymes, a fatty acid-dependent growth phenotype, and elevated expression of the fabHF operon in the mutant strains. Independent manipulation of fabF and fabH expression levels showed that the FabH/FabF activity ratio was a major determinant of antibiotic sensitivity. Missense mutations that reduce FabH activity are sufficient to confer resistance to multiple antibiotics that bind to the FabF acyl-enzyme intermediate in S. aureus.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Oritavancin is a semisynthetic derivative of the glycopeptide antibiotic chloroeremomycin with activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including vancomycin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Compared to vancomycin, oritavancin is characterized by the presence of two additional residues, a hydrophobic 4'-chlorobiphenyl methyl moiety and a 4-epi-vancosamine substituent, which is also present in chloroeremomycin. Here, we show that oritavancin and its des-N-methylleucyl variant (des-oritavancin) effectively inhibit lipid I- and lipid II-consuming peptidoglycan biosynthesis reactions in vitro. In contrast to that for vancomycin, the binding affinity of oritavancin to the cell wall precursor lipid II appears to involve, in addition to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus, other species-specific binding sites of the lipid II molecule, i.e., the crossbridge and D-isoglutamine in position 2 of the lipid II stem peptide, both characteristic for a number of Gram-positive pathogens, including staphylococci and enterococci. Using purified lipid II and modified lipid II variants, we studied the impact of these modifications on the binding of oritavancin and compared it to those of vancomycin, chloroeremomycin, and des-oritavancin. Analysis of the binding parameters revealed that additional intramolecular interactions of oritavancin with the peptidoglycan precursor appear to compensate for the loss of a crucial hydrogen bond in vancomycin-resistant strains, resulting in enhanced binding affinity. Augmenting previous findings, we show that amidation of the lipid II stem peptide predominantly accounts for the increased binding of oritavancin to the modified intermediates ending in D-Ala-D-Lac. Corroborating our conclusions, we further provide biochemical evidence for the phenomenon of the antagonistic effects of mecA and vanA resistance determinants in Staphylococcus aureus, thus partially explaining the low frequency of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) acquiring high-level vancomycin resistance.",

Both molecules are ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics with unusual ring structures. Subtilin-like lantibiotics develop strong antibiotic activities against various Gram-positive organisms with an efficiency similar to that of nisin from Lactococcus lactis. In contrast to nisin, subtilin-like lantibiotics partially undergo an additional posttranslational modification, where the N-terminal tryptophan residue becomes succinylated, resulting in drastically reduced antibiotic activities. A highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based quantification method enabled us to determine entianin and succinylated entianin (S-entianin) concentrations in the supernatant during growth. We show that entianin synthesis and the degree of succinylation drastically change with culture conditions. In particular, increasing glucose concentrations resulted in higher entianin amounts and lower proportions of S-entianin in Landy-based media. In contrast, no succinylation was observed in medium A with 10% glucose. Interestingly, glucose retarded the expression of entianin biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, deletion of the transition state regulator AbrB resulted in a 6-fold increased entianin production in medium A with 10% glucose. This shows that entianin biosynthesis in B. subtilis is strongly influenced by glucose, in addition to its regulation by the transition state regulator AbrB. Our results suggest that the mechanism underlying the succinylation of subtilin-like lantibiotics is enzymatically catalyzed and occurs in the extracellular space or at the cellular membrane.",

With the completion of the genome sequence of FS14, the first comprehensive comparative-genomic analysis of the Serratia genus was performed. Pan-genome and COG analyses showed that the majority of the conserved core genes are involved in basic cellular functions, while genomic factors such as prophages contribute considerably to genome diversity. Additionally, a Type I restriction-modification system, a Type III secretion system and tellurium resistance genes are found in only some Serratia species. Comparative analysis further identified that S. marcescens FS14 possesses multiple mechanisms for antagonism against other microorganisms, including the production of prodigiosin, bacteriocins, and multi-antibiotic resistant determinants as well as chitinases. The presence of two evolutionarily distinct Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) in FS14 may provide further competitive advantages for FS14 against other microbes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of comparative analysis on T6SSs in the genus, which identifies four types of T6SSs in Serratia spp.. Competition bioassays of FS14 against the vital plant pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were performed to support our genomic analyses, in which FS14 demonstrated high antagonistic activities against both bacterial and fungal phytopathogens.",

We previously reported that BacL1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kDa) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan D-isoglutamyl-L-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of E. faecalis when an accessory factor, BacA, is copresent. However, the target of BacL1 remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of BacL1. Fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that BacL1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target E. faecalis cells. This specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the SH3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of BacL1. Repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of BacL1 and BacA. The static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting of BacL1 to the cell division-associated site. Furthermore, the targeting of BacL1 was detectable among Gram-positive bacteria with an L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including E. faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Listeria monocytogenes. These data suggest that BacL1 specifically targets the L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially lyses the E. faecalis cells during cell division.",

Comparative proteomic analysis of the parental ES-2-4 and genome-shuffled FMB38 strains was conducted to examine the differentially expressed proteins. The proteome was separated by 2-DE (two dimensional electrophoresis) and analyzed by MS (mass spectrum). In the shuffled strain FMB38, 51 differentially expressed protein spots with higher than two-fold spot density were detected by gel image comparison. Forty-six protein spots were detectable by silver staining and further MS analysis. The results demonstrated that among the 46 protein spots expressed particularly induced in the genome-shuffled mutant, 15 were related to metabolism, five to DNA replication, recombination and repair, six to translation and post-translational modifications, one to cell secretion and signal transduction mechanisms, three to surfactin synthesis, two to energy production and conversion, and 14 to others. All these indicated that the metabolic capability of the mutant was improved by the genome shuffling. The study will enable future detailed investigation of gene expression and function linked with surfactin synthesis.

        "pmc_abstract": "The bleomycin (BLM) family of glycopeptide-derived antitumor antibiotics consists of BLMs, tallysomycins (TLMs), phleomycins (PLMs), and zorbamycin (ZBM). The self-resistant elements BlmB and TlmB, discovered from the BLM- and TLM-producing organisms Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 and Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC31158, respectively, are N-acetyltransferases that provide resistance to the producers by disrupting the metal-binding domain of the antibiotics required for activity. Although each member of the BLM family of antibiotics possesses a conserved metal-binding domain, the structural differences between each member, namely, the bithiazole moiety and C-terminal amine of BLMs, have been suggested to instill substrate specificity within BlmB. Here we report that BlmB and TlmB readily accept and acetylate BLMs, TLMs, PLMs, and ZBM in vitro but only in the metal-free forms. Kinetic analysis of BlmB and TlmB reveals there is no strong preference or rate enhancement for specific substrates, indicating that the structural differences between each member of the BLM family play a negligible role in substrate recognition, binding, or catalysis. Intriguingly, the zbm gene cluster from Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC21892 does not contain an N-acetyltransferase, yet ZBM is readily acetylated by BlmB and TlmB. We subsequently established that S. flavoviridis lacks the homologue of BlmB and TlmB, and ZbmA, the ZBM-binding protein, alone is sufficient to provide ZBM resistance. We further confirmed that BlmB can indeed confer resistance to ZBM in vivo in S. flavoviridis, introduction of which into wild-type S. flavoviridis further increases the level of resistance.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Aspergillus fumigatus produces a number of secondary metabolites, one of which, gliotoxin, has been shown to exhibit anti-fungal activity. Thus, A. fumigatus must be able to protect itself against gliotoxin. Indeed one of the genes in the gliotoxin biosynthetic gene cluster in A. fumigatus, gliT, is required for self-protection against the toxin- however the global self-protection mechanism deployed is unclear. RNA-seq was employed to identify genes differentially regulated upon exposure to gliotoxin in A. fumigatus wild-type and A. fumigatus âgliT, a strain that is hypersensitive to gliotoxin.<h4>Results</h4>Deletion of A. fumigatus gliT resulted in altered expression of 208 genes (log2 fold change of 1.5) when compared to A. fumigatus wild-type, of which 175 genes were up-regulated and 33 genes were down-regulated. Expression of 164 genes was differentially regulated (log2 fold change of 1.5) in A. fumigatus wild-type when exposed to gliotoxin, consisting of 101 genes with up-regulated expression and 63 genes with down-regulated expression. Interestingly, a much larger number of genes, 1700, were found to be differentially regulated (log2 fold change of 1.5) in A. fumigatus âgliT when challenged with gliotoxin. These consisted of 508 genes with up-regulated expression, and 1192 genes with down-regulated expression. Functional Catalogue (FunCat) classification of differentially regulated genes revealed an enrichment of genes involved in both primary metabolic functions and secondary metabolism. Specifically, genes involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis, helvolic acid biosynthesis, siderophore-iron transport genes and also nitrogen metabolism genes and ribosome biogenesis genes underwent altered expression. It was confirmed that gliotoxin biosynthesis is induced upon exposure to exogenous gliotoxin, production of unrelated secondary metabolites is attenuated in A. fumigatus âgliT, while quantitative proteomic analysis confirmed disrupted translation in A. fumigatus âgliT challenged with exogenous gliotoxin.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study presents the first global investigation of the transcriptional response to exogenous gliotoxin in A. fumigatus wild-type and the hyper-sensitive strain, âgliT. Our data highlight the global and extensive affects of exogenous gliotoxin on a sensitive strain devoid of a self-protection mechanism and infer that GliT functionality is required for the optimal biosynthesis of selected secondary metabolites in A. fumigatus.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Kutzneria is a representative of a rarely observed genus of the family Pseudonocardiaceae. Kutzneria species were initially placed in the Streptosporangiaceae genus and later reconsidered to be an independent genus of the Pseudonocardiaceae. Kutzneria albida is one of the eight known members of the genus. This strain is a unique producer of the glycosylated polyole macrolide aculeximycin which is active against both bacteria and fungi. Kutzneria albida genome sequencing and analysis allow a deeper understanding of evolution of this genus of Pseudonocardiaceae, provide new insight in the phylogeny of the genus, as well as decipher the hidden secondary metabolic potential of these rare actinobacteria.<h4>Results</h4>To explore the biosynthetic potential of Kutzneria albida to its full extent, the complete genome was sequenced. With a size of 9,874,926 bp, coding for 8,822 genes, it stands alongside other Pseudonocardiaceae with large circular genomes. Genome analysis revealed 46 gene clusters potentially encoding secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways. Two large genomic islands were identified, containing regions most enriched with secondary metabolism gene clusters. Large parts of this secondary metabolism \"clustome\" are dedicated to siderophores production.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Kutzneria albida is the first species of the genus Kutzneria with a completely sequenced genome. Genome sequencing allowed identifying the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of aculeximycin, one of the largest known oligosaccharide-macrolide antibiotics. Moreover, the genome revealed 45 additional putative secondary metabolite gene clusters, suggesting a huge biosynthetic potential, which makes Kutzneria albida a very rich source of natural products. Comparison of the Kutzneria albida genome to genomes of other actinobacteria clearly shows its close relations with Pseudonocardiaceae in line with the taxonomic position of the genus.",

        "pmc_abstract": "A combined proteomics and metabolomics approach was utilised to advance the identification and characterisation of secondary metabolites in Aspergillus fumigatus. Here, implementation of a shotgun proteomic strategy led to the identification of non-redundant mycelial proteins (n = 414) from A. fumigatus including proteins typically under-represented in 2-D proteome maps: proteins with multiple transmembrane regions, hydrophobic proteins and proteins with extremes of molecular mass and pI. Indirect identification of secondary metabolite cluster expression was also achieved, with proteins (n = 18) from LaeA-regulated clusters detected, including GliT encoded within the gliotoxin biosynthetic cluster. Biochemical analysis then revealed that gliotoxin significantly attenuates H2O2-induced oxidative stress in A. fumigatus (p>0.0001), confirming observations from proteomics data. A complementary 2-D/LC-MS/MS approach further elucidated significantly increased abundance (p<0.05) of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), NADH-quinone oxidoreductase and the gliotoxin oxidoreductase GliT, along with significantly attenuated abundance (p<0.05) of a heat shock protein, an oxidative stress protein and an autolysis-associated chitinase, when gliotoxin and H2O2 were present, compared to H2O2 alone. Moreover, gliotoxin exposure significantly reduced the abundance of selected proteins (p<0.05) involved in de novo purine biosynthesis. Significantly elevated abundance (p<0.05) of a key enzyme, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase Xpt1, utilised in purine salvage, was observed in the presence of H2O2 and gliotoxin. This work provides new insights into the A. fumigatus proteome and experimental strategies, plus mechanistic data pertaining to gliotoxin functionality in the organism.",

Therapeutic application of PIs in an autoimmune disease setting is much less explored, despite a clear rationale of (immuno) proteasome involvement in (auto)antigen presentation, and PIs harboring the capacity to inhibit the activation of nuclear factor-ÎºB and suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6.

A strategy to discover new anti-infective compounds is the evaluation of the genetic capacity of secondary metabolite producers and the activation of cryptic gene clusters (genome mining). One genus known for its potential to synthesize medically important products is Amycolatopsis. However, Amycolatopsis japonicum does not produce an antibiotic under standard laboratory conditions. In contrast to most Amycolatopsis strains, A. japonicum is genetically tractable with different methods. In order to activate a possible silent glycopeptide cluster, we introduced a gene encoding the transcriptional activator of balhimycin biosynthesis, the bbr gene from Amycolatopsis balhimycina (bbrAba), into A. japonicum. This resulted in the production of an antibiotically active compound. Following whole-genome sequencing of A. japonicum, 29 cryptic gene clusters were identified by genome mining. One of these gene clusters is a putative glycopeptide biosynthesis gene cluster. Using bioinformatic tools, ristomycin (syn. ristocetin), a type III glycopeptide, which has antibacterial activity and which is used for the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease and Bernard-Soulier syndrome, was deduced as a possible product of the gene cluster. Chemical analyses by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirmed the in silico prediction that the recombinant A. japonicum/pRM4-bbrAba synthesizes ristomycin A.",

Comparison of the subtilomycin gene cluster with other verified related lantibiotic gene clusters revealed a particular organization of the genes apnI and apnT downstream of apnAPBC, which may be involved in subtilomycin immunity. Through analysis of expression of the apnI and/or apnT genes in the subtilomycin-sensitive strain CU1065 and inactivation of apnI and apnT in the producer strain BSn5, we showed that the single gene apnI, encoding a putative transmembrane protein, was responsible for subtilomycin immunity. To our knowledge, evidence for lantibiotic immunity that is solely dependent on a transmembrane protein is quite rare. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed the abundant presence of ApnI-like proteins that may be responsible for lantibiotic immunity in Bacillus and Paenibacillus. We cloned the paeI gene, encoding one such ApnI-like protein, into CU1065 and showed that it confers resistance to paenibacillin. However, no cross-resistance was detected between ApnI and PaeI, even though subtilomycin and paenibacillin share similar structures, suggesting that the protection provided by ApnI/ApnI-like proteins involves a specific-sequence recognition mechanism. Peptide release/binding assays indicated that the recombinant B. subtilis expressing apnI interacted with subtilomycin. Thus, ApnI represents a novel model for lantibiotic immunity that appears to be common.",

While antibiotic resistance in human pathogens continues to rise at alarming rates, the impact of environmental resistance on human health is still unclear. To investigate the relationship between human-associated and environmental resistomes, we analyzed functional metagenomic selections for resistance against 18 clinically relevant antibiotics from soil and human gut microbiota as well as a set of multidrug-resistant cultured soil isolates. These analyses were enabled by Resfams, a new curated database of protein families and associated highly precise and accurate profile hidden Markov models, confirmed for antibiotic resistance function and organized by ontology. We demonstrate that the antibiotic resistance functions that give rise to the resistance profiles observed in environmental and human-associated microbial communities significantly differ between ecologies. Antibiotic resistance functions that most discriminate between ecologies provide resistance to Î²-lactams and tetracyclines, two of the most widely used classes of antibiotics in the clinic and agriculture. We also analyzed the antibiotic resistance gene composition of over 6000 sequenced microbial genomes, revealing significant enrichment of resistance functions by both ecology and phylogeny. Together, our results indicate that environmental and human-associated microbial communities harbor distinct resistance genes, suggesting that antibiotic resistance functions are largely constrained by ecology.",

PXR can be activated by many endogenous substances and exogenous chemicals, and thus affects chemotherapeutic effects and intervenes drug-drug interactions by regulating its target genes involving drug metabolism and transportation, cell proliferation and apoptosis, and modulating endobiotic homeostasis. Tissue and context-specific regulation of PXR contributes to diverse effects in the treatment for numerous cancers. Genetic variants of PXR lead to intra- and inter-individual differences in the expression and inducibility of PXR, resulting in different responses to chemotherapy in PXR-positive cancers. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss the role of PXR in the metabolism and clearance of anticancer drugs. It is also expected that this review will provide insights into PXR-mediated enhancement for chemotherapeutic treatment, prediction of drug-drug interactions and personalized medicine.",

Using a structural genomics approach and biochemical characterization, two proteins encoded by genes from the 1 biosynthetic gene cluster assigned as \"unknowns\", CalU16 and CalU19, were characterized. Structure analysis revealed that they possess the STeroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein related lipid Transfer (START) domain known mainly to bind and transport lipids and previously identified as the structural signature of the enediyne self-resistance protein CalC. Subsequent study revealed calU16 and calU19 to confer resistance to 1, and reminiscent of the prototype CalC, both CalU16 and CalU19 were cleaved by 1 in vitro. Through site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry, we identified the site of cleavage in each protein and characterized their function in conferring resistance against 1.

Autism has also a striking sex-bias, not fully genetically explainable.<h4>Objective</h4>Our goal was to explain how and in which predisposing conditions some compounds can impair neurodevelopment, why this occurs in the first years of age, and, primarily, why more in males than females.<h4>Methods</h4>We reviewed articles regarding the genetic and environmental etiology of autism and toxins effects on animal models selected from PubMed and databases about autism and toxicology.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our hypothesis proposes that in the first year of life, the decreasing of maternal immune protection and child immune-system immaturity create an immune vulnerability to infection diseases that, especially if treated with antibiotics, could facilitate dysbiosis and GI disorders. This condition triggers a vicious circle between immune system impairment and increasing dysbiosis that leads to leaky gut and neurochemical compounds and/or neurotoxic xenobiotics production and absorption. This alteration affects the 'gut-brain axis' communication that connects gut with central nervous system via immune system. Thus, metabolic pathways impaired in autistic children can be affected by genetic alterations or by environment-xenobiotics interference. In addition, in animal models many xenobiotics exert their neurotoxicity in a sex-dependent manner.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We integrate fragmented and multi-disciplinary information in a unique hypothesis and first disclose a possible environmental origin for the imbalance of male:female distribution of autism, reinforcing the idea that exogenous factors are related to the recent rise of this disease.",

        "pmc_abstract": "MPA (mycophenolic acid) is an immunosuppressive drug produced by several fungi in Penicillium subgenus Penicillium. This toxic metabolite is an inhibitor of IMPDH (IMP dehydrogenase). The MPA-biosynthetic cluster of Penicillium brevicompactum contains a gene encoding a B-type IMPDH, IMPDH-B, which confers MPA resistance. Surprisingly, all members of the subgenus Penicillium contain genes encoding IMPDHs of both the A and B types, regardless of their ability to produce MPA. Duplication of the IMPDH gene occurred before and independently of the acquisition of the MPAbiosynthetic cluster. Both P. brevicompactum IMPDHs are MPA-resistant, whereas the IMPDHs from a non-producer are MPA-sensitive. Resistance comes with a catalytic cost: whereas P. brevicompactum IMPDH-B is >1000-fold more resistant to MPA than a typical eukaryotic IMPDH, its kcat/Km value is 0.5% of 'normal'. Curiously, IMPDH-B of Penicillium chrysogenum, which does not produce MPA, is also a very poor enzyme. The MPA-binding site is completely conserved among sensitive and resistant IMPDHs. Mutational analysis shows that the C-terminal segment is a major structural determinant of resistance. These observations suggest that the duplication of the IMPDH gene in the subgenus Penicillium was permissive for MPA production and that MPA production created a selective pressure on IMPDH evolution. Perhaps MPA production rescued IMPDH-B from deleterious genetic drift.",

Its biosynthesis contains many intriguing steps, including an oxidative rearrangement, the C-glycosylation, and the generation of a vinyl side chain. These steps all contribute to structural elements of the drug, which are essential for its biological activity, but only poorly understood. Herein we report the cloning and characterization of the gilvocarcin (gil) gene cluster from S. griseoflavus GÃ¶ 3592, and its heterologous expression in a foreign host (S. lividans).

F-box protein Fbx15 is part of the general stress response of the human pathogenic mold Aspergillus fumigatus. Oxidative stress induces a transient peak of fbx15 expression, resulting in 3x elevated Fbx15 protein levels. During non-stress conditions Fbx15 is phosphorylated and F-box mediated interaction with SkpA preferentially happens in smaller subpopulations in the cytoplasm. The F-box of Fbx15 is required for an appropriate oxidative stress response, which results in rapid dephosphorylation of Fbx15 and a shift of the cellular interaction with SkpA to the nucleus. Fbx15 binds SsnF/Ssn6 as part of the RcoA/Tup1-SsnF/Ssn6 co-repressor and is required for its correct nuclear localization. Dephosphorylated Fbx15 prevents SsnF/Ssn6 nuclear localization and results in the derepression of gliotoxin gene expression. fbx15 deletion mutants are unable to infect immunocompromised mice in a model for invasive aspergillosis. Fbx15 has a novel dual molecular function by controlling transcriptional repression and being part of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases, which is essential for stress response, gliotoxin production and virulence in the opportunistic human pathogen A. fumigatus.",

In prodigiosin treated cells above MIC value no significant DNA damage or cytoplasmic membrane disintegration was observed. The outer membrane, however, becomes leaky. Cells had severely decreased respiration activity. In prodigiosin treated cells protein and RNA synthesis were inhibited, cells were elongated but could not divide. Pre-treatment with prodigiosin improved E. coli survival rate in media containing ampicillin, kanamycin and erythromycin but not phleomycin. The results suggest that prodigiosin acts as a bacteriostatic agent in E. coli cells. If prodigiosin was diluted, cells resumed growth.

        "pmc_abstract": "Yersinia pestis Caf1 is a multifunctional protein responsible for antiphagocytic activity and is a key protective antigen. It is generally conserved between globally distributed Y. pestis strains, but Y. pestis subsp. microtus biovar caucasica strains circulating within populations of common voles in Georgia and Armenia were reported to carry a single substitution of alanine to serine. We investigated polymorphism of the Caf1 sequences among other Y. pestis subsp. microtus strains, which have a limited virulence in guinea pigs and in humans. Sequencing of caf1 genes from 119 Y. pestis strains belonging to different biovars within subsp. microtus showed that the Caf1 proteins exist in three isoforms, the global type Caf1NT1 (Ala48 Phe117), type Caf1NT2 (Ser48 Phe117) found in Transcaucasian-highland and Pre-Araks natural plague foci #4-7, and a novel Caf1NT3 type (Ala48 Val117) endemic in Dagestan-highland natural plague focus #39. Both minor types are the progenies of the global isoform. In this report, Caf1 polymorphism was analyzed by comparing predicted intrinsic disorder propensities and potential protein-protein interactivities of the three Caf1 isoforms. The analysis revealed that these properties of Caf1 protein are minimally affected by its polymorphism. All protein isoforms could be equally detected by an immunochromatography test for plague at the lowest protein concentration tested (1.0 ng/mL), which is the detection limit. When compared to the classic Caf1NT1 isoform, the endemic Caf1NT2 or Caf1NT3 had lower immunoreactivity in ELISA and lower indices of self- and cross-protection. Despite a visible reduction in cross-protection between all Caf1 isoforms, our data suggest that polymorphism in the caf1 gene may not allow the carriers of Caf1NT2 or Caf1NT3 variants escaping from the Caf1NT1-mediated immunity to plague in the case of a low-dose flea-borne infection.",

Here, we show that the LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) protein PdtA (SCO2578), a TagV-like glycopolymer transferase, has a dual function in the S. coelicolor A3(2) life cycle. Despite the presence of 10 additional LCP homologs, PdtA is crucial for proper sporulation. The integrity of the spore envelope was severely affected in a pdtA deletion mutant, resulting in 34% nonviable spores. pdtA deletion caused a significant reduction in the polydiglycosylphosphate content of the spore envelope. Beyond that, apical tip extension and normal branching of vegetative mycelium were severely impaired on high-salt medium. This growth defect coincided with the mislocalization of peptidoglycan synthesis. Thus, PdtA itself or the polydiglycosylphosphate attached to the peptidoglycan by the glycopolymer transferase PdtA also has a crucial function in apical tip extension of vegetative hyphae under stress conditions.<h4>Importance</h4>Anionic glycopolymers are underappreciated components of the Gram-positive cell envelope. They provide rigidity to the cell wall and position extracellular enzymes involved in peptidoglycan remodeling. Although Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), the model organism for bacterial antibiotic production, is known to produce two distinct cell wall-linked glycopolymers, teichulosonic acid and polydiglycosylphosphate, the role of these glycopolymers in the S. coelicolor A3(2) life cycle has not been addressed so far. This study reveals a crucial function of the anionic glycopolymer polydiglycosylphosphate for the growth and morphological differentiation of S. coelicolor A3(2). Polydiglycosylphosphate is attached to the spore wall by the LytR-CpsA-Psr protein PdtA (SCO2578), a component of the Streptomyces spore wall-synthesizing complex (SSSC), to ensure the integrity of the spore envelope. Surprisingly, PdtA also has a crucial role in vegetative growth under stress conditions and is required for proper peptidoglycan incorporation during apical tip extension.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Bacteriocin 41 (Bac41) is the plasmid-encoded bacteriocin produced by the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis Its genetic determinant consists of bacL1 (effector), bacL2 (regulator), bacA (effector), and bacI (immunity). The secreted effectors BacL1 and BacA coordinate to induce the lytic cell death of E. faecalis Meanwhile, the immunity factor BacI provides self-resistance to the Bac41 producer, E. faecalis, against the action of BacL1 and BacA. In this study, we demonstrated that more than half of the 327 clinical strains of E. faecalis screened had functional Bac41 genes. Analysis of the genetic structure of the Bac41 genes in the DNA sequences of the E. faecalis strains revealed that the Bac41-like genes consist of a relatively conserved region and a variable region located downstream from bacA Based on similarities in the variable region, the Bac41-like genes could be classified into type I, type IIa, and type IIb. Interestingly, the distinct Bac41 types had specific immunity factors for self-resistance, BacI1 or BacI2, and did not show cross-immunity to the other type of effector. We also demonstrated experimentally that the specificity of the immunity was determined by the combination of the C-terminal region of BacA and the presence of the unique BacI1 or BacI2 factor. These observations suggested that Bac41-like bacteriocin genes are extensively disseminated among E. faecalis strains in the clinical environment and can be grouped into at least three types. It was also indicated that the partial diversity results in specificity of self-resistance which may offer these strains a competitive advantage.<h4>Importance</h4>Bacteriocins are antibacterial effectors produced by bacteria. In general, a bacteriocin-coding gene is accompanied by a cognate immunity gene that confers self-resistance on the bacteriocin-producing bacterium itself. We demonstrated that one of the bacteriocins, Bac41, is disseminated among E. faecalis clinical strains and the Bac41 subtypes with partial diversity. The Bac41-like bacteriocins were found to be classified into type I, type IIa, and type IIb by variation of the cognate immunity factors. The antibacterial activity of the respective effectors was specifically inhibited by the immunity factor from the same type of Bac41 but not the other types. This specificity of effector-immunity pairs suggests that bacteriocin genes might have evolved to change the immunity specificity to acquire an advantage in interbacterial competition.",

Thus, we performed anaerobic digestion using dairy manure at three temperature levels (moderate: 20âÂ°C, mesophilic: 35âÂ°C, and thermophilic: 55âÂ°C), to analyze the dynamics of ARGs and bacterial communities by quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that 8/10 detected ARGs declined and 5/10 decreased more than 1.0 log during thermophilic digestion, whereas only four and five ARGs decreased during moderate and mesophilic digestion, respectively. The changes in ARGs and bacterial communities were similar under the moderate and mesophilic treatments, but distinct from those in the thermophilic system. Potential pathogens such as Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Corynebacterium were removed by thermophilic digestion but not by moderate and mesophilic digestion. The bacterial community succession was the dominant mechanism that influenced the variation in ARGs and integrons during anaerobic digestion. Thermophilic digestion decreased the amount of mesophilic bacteria (Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria) carrying ARGs. Anaerobic digestion generally decreased the abundance of integrons by eliminating the aerobic hosts of integrons (Actinomycetales and Bacilli). Thermophilic anaerobic digestion is recommended for the treatment and reuse of animal manure.",

We coined the term endocides (endogenous biocides) to describe such metabolites that can poison or inhibit the parent via induced biosynthesis or external applications. Dosage-dependent endocides can selectively induce morphological mutations in the parent organism (e.g., shrubbiness/dwarfism, pleiocotyly, abnormal leaf morphogenesis, disturbed phyllotaxis, fasciated stems, and variegation in plants), inhibit its growth, development, and reproduction and cause death than non-closely related species.

Apart from that, little is known about its secondary metabolism and not all toxic substances going along with the food contamination with Claviceps are known yet. We explored the metabolite profile of a gene cluster in C. purpurea with a high homology to gene clusters, which are responsible for the formation of epipolythiodiketopiperazine (ETP) toxins in other fungi. By overexpressing the transcription factor, we were able to activate the cluster in the standard C. purpurea strain 20.1. Although all necessary genes for the formation of the characteristic disulfide bridge were expressed in the overexpression mutants, the fungus did not produce any ETPs. Isolation of pathway intermediates showed that the common biosynthetic pathway stops after the first steps. Our results demonstrate that hydroxylation of the diketopiperazine backbone is the critical step during the ETP biosynthesis. Due to a dysfunctional enzyme, the fungus is not able to produce toxic ETPs. Instead, the pathway end-products are new unusual metabolites with a unique nitrogen-sulfur bond. By heterologous expression of the Leptosphaeria maculans cytochrome P450 encoding gene sirC, we were able to identify the end-products of the ETP cluster in C. purpurea. The thioclapurines are so far unknown ETPs, which might contribute to the toxicity of other C. purpurea strains with a potentially intact ETP cluster.",

Here we describe a chemical-genomic screen in Escherichia coli K-12 that was designed to discover new aspects of antibiotic resistance by focusing on a set of 26 antibiotics and other stresses with poorly characterized mode-of-action and determinants of resistance. We show that the screen identifies new resistance determinants for these antibiotics including a common signature from two antimicrobials, kasugamycin and blasticidin S, used to treat crop diseases like rice blast and fire blight. Following this signature, we further investigated the mechanistic basis for susceptibility to kasugamycin and blasticidin S in E. coli using both genetic and biochemical approaches. We provide evidence that these compounds hijack an overlapping set of peptide ABC-importers to enter the bacterial cell. Loss of uptake may be an underappreciated mechanism for the development of kasugamycin resistance in bacterial plant pathogens.",

In P. aeruginosa phenazine biosynthesis, conversion of PCA to pyocyanin is presumed to proceed through the intermediate 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylate (5-Me-PCA), a reactive compound that has eluded detection in most laboratory samples. Here, we apply electrochemical methods to directly detect 5-Me-PCA and find that it is transported by MexGHI-OpmD in P. aeruginosa strain PA14 planktonic and biofilm cells. We also show that 5-Me-PCA is sufficient to fully induce MexGHI-OpmD expression and that it is required for wild-type colony biofilm morphogenesis. These physiological effects are consistent with the high redox potential of 5-Me-PCA, which distinguishes it from other well-studied P. aeruginosa phenazines. Our observations highlight the importance of this compound, which was previously overlooked due to the challenges associated with its detection, in the context of P. aeruginosa gene expression and multicellular behavior. This study constitutes a unique demonstration of efflux-based self-resistance, controlled by a simple circuit, in a Gram-negative pathogen.",

The focus of this study is the closely related ST analogue BD-12, which carries a glycine-derived side chain rather than a Î²-Lys residue. Here, in Streptomyces luteocolor NBRC13826, we describe our biosynthetic studies of BD-12, which revealed that the peptide bond between the amino sugar and the glycine residue is catalyzed by a Fem-like enzyme (Orf11) in a tRNA-dependent manner rather than by an NRPS. Although there have been several reports of peptide bond-forming tRNA-dependent enzymes, to our knowledge, Orf11 is the first enzyme that can accept an amino sugar as a substrate. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the structural diversity of the side chains of ST-type compounds in nature is generated in an unusual manner via two distinct peptide bond-forming mechanisms. Moreover, the identification and functional analysis of Orf11 resulted in not only the production of new ST-related compounds, but also the provision of new insights into the structure-activity relationship of the ST-related antibiotics.<h4>Importance</h4>The antibiotic streptothricin (ST) possesses an amino sugar bound to an l-Î²-lysine (Î²-Lys) side chain via a peptide bond formed by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS).

While the FabI ENR is a well-validated drug target in organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus, alternate ENR isoforms have been discovered in other pathogens, including the FabV enzyme that is the sole ENR in Yersinia pestis (ypFabV). Previously, we showed that the prototypical ENR inhibitor triclosan was a poor inhibitor of ypFabV and that inhibitors based on the 2-pyridone scaffold were more potent [Hirschbeck, M. (2012) Structure 20 (1), 89-100]. These studies were performed with the T276S FabV variant. In the work presented here, we describe a detailed examination of the mechanism and inhibition of wild-type ypFabV and the T276S variant. The T276S mutation significantly reduces the affinity of diphenyl ether inhibitors for ypFabV (20-fold â 100-fold). In addition, while T276S ypFabV generally displays an affinity for 2-pyridone inhibitors higher than that of the wild-type enzyme, the 4-pyridone scaffold yields compounds with similar affinity for both wild-type and T276S ypFabV. T276 is located at the N-terminus of the helical substrate-binding loop, and structural studies coupled with site-directed mutagenesis reveal that alterations in this residue modulate the size of the active site portal. Subsequently, we were able to probe the mechanism of time-dependent inhibition in this enzyme family by extending the inhibition studies to include P142W ypFabV, a mutation that results in a gain of slow-onset inhibition for the 4-pyridone PT156.",

ToxA is a predicted S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, and toxA knockouts of B. glumae are less virulent in plant infection models. In this study, we show that ToxA performs two consecutive methylations to convert the putative azapteridine intermediate, 1,6-didemethyltoxoflavin, to toxoflavin. In addition, we report a series of crystal structures of ToxA complexes that reveals the molecular basis of the dual methyltransferase activity. The results suggest sequential methylations with initial methylation at N6 of 1,6-didemethyltoxoflavin followed by methylation at N1. The two azapteridine orientations that position N6 or N1 for methylation are coplanar with a 140Â° rotation between them. The structure of ToxA contains a class I methyltransferase fold having an N-terminal extension that either closes over the active site or is largely disordered. The ordered conformation places Tyr7 at a position of a structurally conserved tyrosine site of unknown function in various methyltransferases. Crystal structures of ToxA-Y7F consistently show a closed active site, whereas structures of ToxA-Y7A consistently show an open active site, suggesting that the hydroxyl group of Tyr7 plays a role in opening and closing the active site during the multistep reaction.",

Interestingly, these bacteria are equipped with an extraordinary capability of producing antibiotics and other metabolites which have medicinal properties. With the advent of inexpensive genome sequencing techniques and their clinical importance, many genomes of Actinobacteria have been successfully sequenced. These days, with the constant increasing number of drug-resistant bacteria, the urgent need for discovering new antibiotics has emerged as a major scientific challenge. And, unfortunately the traditional method of screening bacterial strains for the production of antibiotics has decreased leading to a paradigm shift in the planning and execution of discovery of novel biosynthetic gene clusters via genome mining process. The entire focus has shifted to the evaluation of genetic capacity of organisms for metabolite production and activation of cryptic gene clusters. This has been made possible only due to the availability of genome sequencing and has been augmented by genomic studies and new biotechnological approaches. Through this article, we present the analysis of the genomes of species belonging to the genus Amycolatopsis, sequenced till date with a focus on completely sequenced genomes and their application for further studies.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The soil bacterium Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 can colonize root and seed surfaces of many plants, protecting them from infection by plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes. The capacity to suppress disease is attributed to Pf-5's production of a large spectrum of antibiotics, which is controlled by complex regulatory circuits operating at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In this study, we analyzed the genomic sequence of Pf-5 for codon usage patterns and observed that the six rarest codons in the genome are present in all seven known antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters. In particular, there is an abundance of rare codons in pltR, which encodes a member of the LysR transcriptional regulator family that controls the expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes. To test the hypothesis that rare codons in pltR influence pyoluteorin production, we generated a derivative of Pf-5 in which 23 types of rare codons in pltR were substituted with synonymous preferred codons. The resultant mutant produced pyoluteorin at levels 15 times higher than that of the wild-type Pf-5. Accordingly, the promoter activity of the pyoluteorin biosynthetic gene pltL was 20 times higher in the codon-modified stain than in the wild-type. pltR has six AGA codons, which is the rarest codon in the Pf-5 genome. Substitution of all six AGA codons with preferred Arg codons resulted in a variant of pltR that conferred increased pyoluteorin production and pltL promoter activity. Furthermore, overexpression of tRNA[Formula: see text], the cognate tRNA for the AGA codon, significantly increased pyoluteorin production by Pf-5. A bias in codon usage has been linked to the regulation of many phenotypes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes but, to our knowledge, this is the first example of the role of a rare codon in the regulation of antibiotic production by a Gram-negative bacterium.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Yersinia ruckeri is the etiologic agent of enteric red mouth disease (ERM), a severe fish disease prevailing in worldwide aquaculture industries. Here we report for the first time the complete genome of Y. ruckeri (Yersinia ruckeri) SC09, a highly virulent strain isolated from Ictalurus punctatus with severe septicemia. SC09 possesses a single chromosome of 3,923,491 base pairs, which contains 3651 predicted protein coding sequences (CDS), 19 rRNA genes, and 79 tRNA genes. Among the CDS, we have identified a Ysa locus containing genes encoding all the components of a type III secretion system (T3SS). Comparative analysis suggest that SC09-Ysa share extensive similarity in sequence, gene content, and gene arrangement with Salmonella enterica pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) and chromosome-encoded T3SS from Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1B. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis shown that SC09-Ysa and SPI1-T3SS belong on the same branch of the phylogenetic tree. These results suggest that SC09-Ysa and SPI1-T3SS appear to mediate biological function to adapt to specific hosts with a similar niche, and both of them are likely to facilitate the development of an intracellular niche. In addition, our analysis also indicated that a substantial part of the SC09 genome might contribute to adaption in the intestinal microenvironment, including a number of proteins associated with aerobic or anaerobic respiration, signal transduction, and various stress reactions. Genomic analysis of the bacterium offered insights into the pathogenic mechanism associated with intracellular infection and intestinal survivability, which constitutes an important first step in understanding the pathogenesis of Y. ruckeri.",

Owing to advances in functional genomics and genetic engineering technologies, microbial hosts can be engineered to overproduce a desired natural product, greatly accelerating the traditionally time-consuming strain improvement process. This review covers recent developments and challenges in the engineering of native and heterologous microbial hosts for the production of bacterial natural products, focusing on the genetic tools and strategies for strain improvement. Special emphasis is placed on bioactive secondary metabolites from actinomycetes. The considerations for the choice of host systems will also be discussed in this review.",

NGR is a CTP that targets CD13 in tumor vasculature.

Further examination of the donor substrate scope for CapW revealed that this enzyme can also catalyze a direct transamidation reaction using the major capuramycin congener as a semisynthetic precursor. Biological activity tests revealed that a few of the new capuramycin analogues have significantly improved antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2 155 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.

However, the genes involved in the hypocrellin A anabolic pathways were still unknown due to the lack of genomic information for this species. To investigate putative genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of hypocrellin A and determine the pathway, we performed transcriptome sequencing for Shiraia bambusicola S4201-W and the mutant S4201-D1 for the first time. S4201-W has excellent hypocrellin A production, while the mutant S4201-D1 does not. Then, we obtained 38,056,034 and 39,086,896 clean reads from S4201-W and S4201-D1, respectively. In all, 17,923 unigenes were de novo assembled, and the N50 length was 1970 bp. Based on the negative binomial distribution test, 716 unigenes were found to be upregulated, and 188 genes were downregulated in S4201-D1, compared with S4201-W. We have found seven unigenes involved in the biosynthesis of hypocrellin A and proposed a putative hypocrellin A biosynthetic pathway. These data will provide a valuable resource and theoretical basis for future molecular studies of hypocrellin A, help identify the genes involved in the biosynthesis of hypocrellin A and help facilitate functional studies for enhancing hypocrellin A production.",

SCO4439 harbors a DD-CPase domain and a putative transcriptional regulator domain, separated by a putative transmembrane region. The recombinant protein shows that DD-CPase activity is inhibited by penicillin G. The spores of the SCO4439::Tn5062 mutant are affected in their resistance to heat and acid and showed a dramatic increase in swelling during germination. The mycelium of the SCO4439::Tn5062 mutant is more sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). The DD-CPase domain and the hydrophobic transmembrane region are highly conserved in Streptomyces, and both are essential for complementing the wild type phenotypes in the mutant. A model for the biological mechanism behind the observed phenotypes is proposed, in which SCO4439 DD-CPase releases D-Ala from peptidoglycan (PG) precursors, thereby reducing the substrate pool for PG crosslinking (transpeptidation). PG crosslinking regulates spore physical resistance and germination, and modulates mycelium resistance to glycopeptides. This study is the first demonstration of the role of a DD-CPase in the maturation of the spore cell wall.",

Currently, nearly all commercial polyketides are prepared through fermentation or semi-synthesis. However, elucidation and engineering of polyketide pathways in the native filamentous fungi hosts are often hampered due to a lack of established genetic tools and of understanding of the regulation of fungal secondary metabolisms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has many advantages beneficial to the study and development of polyketide pathways from filamentous fungi due to its extensive genetic toolbox and well-studied metabolism.

        "pmc_abstract": "While we have come to appreciate the architectural complexity of microbially synthesized secondary metabolites, far less attention has been paid to linking their structural features with possible modes of action. This is certainly the case with tropodithietic acid (TDA), a broad-spectrum antibiotic generated by marine bacteria that engage in dynamic symbioses with microscopic algae. TDA promotes algal health by killing unwanted marine pathogens; however, its mode of action (MoA) and significance for the survival of an algal-bacterial miniecosystem remains unknown. Using cytological profiling, we herein determine the MoA of TDA and surprisingly find that it acts by a mechanism similar to polyether antibiotics, which are structurally highly divergent. We show that like polyether drugs, TDA collapses the proton motive force by a proton antiport mechanism, in which extracellular protons are exchanged for cytoplasmic cations. The Î±-carboxy-tropone substructure is ideal for this purpose as the proton can be carried on the carboxyl group, whereas the basicity of the tropylium ion facilitates cation export. Based on similarities to polyether anticancer agents we have further examined TDA's cytotoxicity and find it to exhibit potent, broad-spectrum anticancer activities. These results highlight the power of MoA-profiling technologies in repurposing old drugs for new targets. In addition, we identify an operon that confers TDA resistance to the producing marine bacteria. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses of these genes lead to a previously unknown metabolic link between TDA/acid resistance and the Î³-glutamyl cycle. The implications of this resistance mechanism in the context of the algal-bacterial symbiosis are discussed.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The filamentous actinomycete Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 produces the lantibiotic NAI-107, which is an antibiotic peptide effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. In actinomycetes, antibiotic production is often associated with a physiological differentiation program controlled by a complex regulatory and metabolic network that may be elucidated by the integration of genomic, proteomic and bioinformatic tools. Accordingly, an extensive evaluation of the proteomic changes associated with NAI-107 production was performed on Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 by combining two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and gene ontology approaches.<h4>Results</h4>Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 cultivations in a complex medium were characterized by stages of biomass accumulation (A) followed by biomass yield decline (D). NAI-107 production started at 90Â h (A stage), reached a maximum at 140Â h (D stage) and decreased thereafter. To reveal patterns of differentially represented proteins associated with NAI-107 production onset and maintenance, differential proteomic analyses were carried-out on biomass samples collected: i) before (66Â h) and during (90Â h) NAI-107 production at A stage; ii) during three time-points (117, 140, and 162Â h) at D stage characterized by different profiles of NAI-107 yield accumulation (117 and 140Â h) and decrement (162Â h). Regulatory, metabolic and unknown-function proteins, were identified and functionally clustered, revealing that nutritional signals, regulatory cascades and primary metabolism shift-down trigger the accumulation of protein components involved in nitrogen and phosphate metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis/maturation, lipid metabolism, osmotic stress response, multi-drug resistance, and NAI-107 transport. The stimulating role on physiological differentiation of a TetR-like regulator, originally identified in this study, was confirmed by the construction of an over-expressing strain. Finally, the possible role of cellular response to membrane stability alterations and of multi-drug resistance ABC transporters as additional self-resistance mechanisms toward the lantibiotic was confirmed by proteomic and confocal microscopy experiments on a Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 lantibiotic-null producer strain which was exposed to an externally-added amount of NAI-107 during growth.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study provides a net contribution to the elucidation of the regulatory, metabolic and molecular patterns controlling physiological differentiation in Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024, supporting the relevance of proteomics in revealing protein players of antibiotic biosynthesis in actinomycetes.",

Additionally, this fungus is able to produce several secondary metabolites, including the meroterpenoid compound mycophenolic acid (MPA). Cheeses ripened with P. roqueforti are usually contaminated with MPA. On the other hand, MPA is a commercially valuable immunosuppressant. However, to date the molecular basis of the production of MPA by P. roqueforti is still unknown. Using a bioinformatic approach, we have identified a genomic region of approximately 24.4 kbp containing a seven-gene cluster that may be involved in the MPA biosynthesis in P. roqueforti. Gene silencing of each of these seven genes (named mpaA, mpaB, mpaC, mpaDE, mpaF, mpaG and mpaH) resulted in dramatic reductions in MPA production, confirming that all of these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the compound. Interestingly, the mpaF gene, originally described in P. brevicompactum as a MPA self-resistance gene, also exerts the same function in P. roqueforti, suggesting that this gene has a dual function in MPA metabolism. The knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway of MPA in P. roqueforti will be important for the future control of MPA contamination in cheeses and the improvement of MPA production for commercial purposes.",

Discovery Studio 3.5 and two pharmacophore databases (PharmaDB and HypoDB) were employed for the target profiling. A compound-target interaction network of M. cordata was constructed and analyzed by Cytoscape 3.0.<h4>Results</h4>Thirteen of the 65 predicted targets identified by PharmaDB were confirmed as targets by HypoDB screening. The targets in the interaction network of M. cordata were involved in cancer (31 targets), microorganisms (12 targets), neurodegeneration (10 targets), inflammation and autoimmunity (8 targets), parasitosis (5 targets), injury (4 targets), and pain (3 targets). Dihydrochelerythrine (C6) was found to hit 23 fitting targets. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) hits 15 alkaloids (C1-2, C11-16, C19-25) was the most promising target related to cancer.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Through in silico target fishing, the anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects of M. cordata were the most significant among many possible activities. The possible anticancer effects were mainly contributed by the isoquinoline alkaloids as active components.",

We here present a systematic analysis of the substrate specificity of the glycine-incorporating adenylation domain from the kalimantacin biosynthetic assembly line by a targeted mutagenesis approach. The specificity-conferring code was adapted for use in Pseudomonas and mutated adenylation domain active site sequences were introduced in the kalimantacin gene cluster, using a newly adapted ligation independent cloning method. Antimicrobial activity screens and LC-MS analyses revealed that the production of the kalimantacin analogues in the mutated strains was abolished. These results support the idea that further insight in the specificity of downstream domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases is required to efficiently engineer these strains in vivo.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Pseudomonas protegens strain Pf-5 is a rhizosphere bacterium that suppresses soilborne plant diseases and produces at least seven different secondary metabolites with antifungal properties. We derived mutants of Pf-5 with single and multiple mutations in biosynthesis genes for seven antifungal metabolites: 2,4-diacetylphoroglucinol (DAPG), pyrrolnitrin, pyoluteorin, hydrogen cyanide, rhizoxin, orfamide A, and toxoflavin. These mutants were tested for inhibition of the pathogens Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. pisi. Rhizoxin, pyrrolnitrin, and DAPG were found to be primarily responsible for fungal antagonism by Pf-5. Previously, other workers showed that the mycotoxin fusaric acid, which is produced by many Fusarium species, including F. verticillioides, inhibited the production of DAPG by Pseudomonas spp. In this study, amendment of culture media with fusaric acid decreased DAPG production, increased pyoluteorin production, and had no consistent influence on pyrrolnitrin or orfamide A production by Pf-5. Fusaric acid also altered the transcription of biosynthetic genes, indicating that the mycotoxin influenced antibiotic production by Pf-5 at the transcriptional level. Addition of fusaric acid to the culture medium reduced antibiosis of F. verticillioides by Pf-5 and derivative strains that produce DAPG but had no effect on antibiosis by Pf-5 derivatives that suppressed F. verticillioides due to pyrrolnitrin or rhizoxin production. Our results demonstrated the importance of three compounds, rhizoxin, pyrrolnitrin, and DAPG, in suppression of Fusarium spp. by Pf-5 and confirmed that an interspecies signaling system mediated by fusaric acid had parallel effects on antifungal metabolite production and antibiosis by the bacterial biological control organism.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The peptidyl nucleoside blasticidin S (BS) isolated from Streptomyces griseochromogenes was the first non-mercurial fungicide used on a large scale to prevent rice blast. In the biosynthesis of BS, leucylblasticidin S (LBS) was suggested as the penultimate metabolite with 20-fold less inhibitory activity than the final product BS. Incomplete conversion of LBS to BS at a variable efficiency ranging from 10% to 90% was observed either in the native strain S. griseochromogenes or a heterologous producer Streptomyces lividans WJ2. In this study, we determined that maturation of BS from LBS is not a spontaneous process but is governed by a standalone peptidase PepN, which hydrolyzes LBS in a pH-sensitive way with most appropriate of pH 7~8 but is inactive when the pH is below 5 or above 10. PepN1 and PepN2, two neighboring PepN homologs from Streptomyces lividans were purified in E. coli but displayed ca.100-fold difference in LBS hydrolytic activity. Overexpression of pepN1 in WJ2 enhanced BS yield by 100% and lowered the ratio of LBS to BS from 2:1 to 2:3. This work presents the expansion of the biological role for PepN in antibiotic maturation and the first report of hydrolysis of beta amide linkage by this conserved enzyme.",

While several gene clusters consistent with this molecule's newly reported modification had previously been identified in metagenomic studies, the metabolite itself has been cryptic.

        "pmc_abstract": "The bleomycins (BLMs), tallysomycins (TLMs), phleomycin, and zorbamycin (ZBM) are members of the BLM family of glycopeptide-derived antitumor antibiotics. The BLM-producing Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 and the TLM-producing Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC31158 both possess at least two self-resistance elements, an N-acetyltransferase and a binding protein. The N-acetyltransferase provides resistance by disrupting the metal-binding domain of the antibiotic that is required for activity, while the binding protein confers resistance by sequestering the metal-bound antibiotic and preventing drug activation via molecular oxygen. We recently established that the ZBM producer, Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC21892, lacks the N-acetyltransferase resistance gene and that the ZBM-binding protein, ZbmA, is sufficient to confer resistance in the producing strain. To investigate the resistance mechanism attributed to ZbmA, we determined the crystal structures of apo and Cu(II)-ZBM-bound ZbmA at high resolutions of 1.90 and 1.65 Ã, respectively. A comparison and contrast with other structurally characterized members of the BLM-binding protein family revealed key differences in the protein-ligand binding environment that fine-tunes the ability of ZbmA to sequester metal-bound ZBM and supports drug sequestration as the primary resistance mechanism in the producing organisms of the BLM family of antitumor antibiotics.",

In this review, we discuss the delivery of diverse effectors by the Type VI secretion system, the modes of action of the so-called 'anti-bacterial' and 'anti-eukaryotic' effectors, the mechanism of self-resistance against anti-bacterial effectors and the evolutionary implications of horizontal transfer of Type VI secretion system-associated toxins.

        "pmc_abstract": "Threats to genomic integrity arising from DNA damage are mitigated by DNA glycosylases, which initiate the base excision repair pathway by locating and excising aberrant nucleobases. How these enzymes find small modifications within the genome is a current area of intensive research. A hallmark of these and other DNA repair enzymes is their use of base flipping to sequester modified nucleotides from the DNA helix and into an active site pocket. Consequently, base flipping is generally regarded as an essential aspect of lesion recognition and a necessary precursor to base excision. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, DNA glycosylase mechanism that does not require base flipping for either binding or catalysis. Using the DNA glycosylase AlkD from Bacillus cereus, we crystallographically monitored excision of an alkylpurine substrate as a function of time, and reconstructed the steps along the reaction coordinate through structures representing substrate, intermediate and product complexes. Instead of directly interacting with the damaged nucleobase, AlkD recognizes aberrant base pairs through interactions with the phosphoribose backbone, while the lesion remains stacked in the DNA duplex. Quantum mechanical calculations revealed that these contacts include catalytic charge-dipole and CH-Ï interactions that preferentially stabilize the transition state. We show in vitro and in vivo how this unique means of recognition and catalysis enables AlkD to repair large adducts formed by yatakemycin, a member of the duocarmycin family of antimicrobial natural products exploited in bacterial warfare and chemotherapeutic trials. Bulky adducts of this or any type are not excised by DNA glycosylases that use a traditional base-flipping mechanism. Hence, these findings represent a new model for DNA repair and provide insights into catalysis of base excision.",

Liquid chromatography can be used to measure the abundance of the muropeptide subunits composing the cell wall. Characteristics such as the degree of cross-linking and average glycan strand length are known to vary across species. However, a systematic comparison among strains of a given species has yet to be undertaken, making it difficult to assess the origins of variability in peptidoglycan composition. We present a protocol for muropeptide analysis using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and demonstrate that UPLC achieves resolution comparable with that of HPLC while requiring orders of magnitude less injection volume and a fraction of the elution time. We also developed a software platform to automate the identification and quantification of chromatographic peaks, which we demonstrate has improved accuracy relative to other software. This combined experimental and computational methodology revealed that peptidoglycan composition was approximately maintained across strains from three Gram-negative species despite taxonomical and morphological differences. Peptidoglycan composition and density were maintained after we systematically altered cell size in Escherichia coli using the antibiotic A22, indicating that cell shape is largely decoupled from the biochemistry of peptidoglycan synthesis. High-throughput, sensitive UPLC combined with our automated software for chromatographic analysis will accelerate the discovery of peptidoglycan composition and the molecular mechanisms of cell wall structure determination.",

The presented structural and biochemical data indicate that HygA does not interfere with the initial binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site, but prevents its subsequent adjustment such that it fails to act as a substrate in the PT reaction. Structurally we demonstrate that HygA binds within the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and induces a unique conformation. Specifically in its ribosomal binding site HygA would overlap and clash with aminoacyl-A76 ribose moiety and, therefore, its primary mode of action involves sterically restricting access of the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA to the PTC.",

In the biosynthetic study of azinomycin B, a gene (orf1) adjacent to the azinomycin B gene cluster was found to be essential for the survival of the producer, Streptomyces sahachiroi ATCC33158. Sequence analyses revealed that Orf1 belongs to the HTH_42 superfamily of conserved bacterial proteins which are widely distributed in pathogenic and antibiotic-producing bacteria with unknown functions. The protein exhibits a protective effect against azinomycin B when heterologously expressed in azinomycin-sensitive strains. EMSA assays showed its sequence nonspecific binding to DNA and structure-specific binding to azinomycin B-adducted sites, and ChIP assays revealed extensive association of Orf1 with chromatin in vivo. Interestingly, Orf1 not only protects target sites by protein-DNA interaction but is also capable of repairing azinomycin B-mediated DNA cross-linking. It possesses the DNA glycosylase-like activity and specifically repairs DNA damage induced by azinomycin B through removal of both adducted nitrogenous bases in the cross-link. This bifunctional protein massively binds to genomic DNA to reduce drug attack risk as a novel DNA binding protein and triggers the base excision repair system as a novel DNA glycosylase.",

Aurovertins contain a 2,6-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane ring that is proposed to be derived from a polyene precursor through regioselective oxidations and epoxide openings. In this study, we identified only four enzymes required to produce aurovertin E. The core polyketide synthase produces a polyene Î±-pyrone. Following pyrone O-methylation by a methyltransferase, a flavin-dependent mono-oxygenase and an epoxide hydrolase can iteratively transform the terminal triene portion of the precursor into the dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold. We demonstrate that a tetrahydrofuranyl polyene is the first stable intermediate in the transformation, which can undergo epoxidation and anti-Baldwin 6-endo-tet ring opening to yield the cyclic ether product. Our results further demonstrate the highly concise and efficient ways in which fungal biosynthetic pathways can generate complex natural product scaffolds.",

The herbicide phosphinothricin-tripeptide (PTT) was the first phosphinate natural product discovered, yet despite numerous studies, questions remain surrounding key transformations required for its biosynthesis. In particular, the enzymology required to convert phosphonoformate to carboxyphosphonoenolpyruvate and the mechanisms underlying phosphorus methylation remain poorly understood. In addition, the model for non-ribosomal peptide synthetase assembly of the intact tripeptide product has undergone numerous revisions that have yet to be experimentally tested. To further investigate the biosynthesis of this unusual natural product, we completely sequenced the PTT biosynthetic locus from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and compared it with the orthologous cluster from Streptomyces viridochromogenes. We also sequenced and analyzed the closely related phosalacine (PAL) biosynthetic locus from Kitasatospora phosalacinea. Using data drawn from the comparative analysis of the PTT and PAL pathways, we also evaluate three related recently discovered phosphonate biosynthetic loci from Streptomyces sviceus, Streptomyces sp. WM6386 and Frankia alni. Our observations address long-standing biosynthetic questions related to PTT and PAL production and suggest that additional members of this pharmacologically important class await discovery.",

These natural products are valued for their bioactive properties stemming from their functions in fungal biology, key among those protection from abiotic and biotic stress and establishment of a secure niche. The producing fungus must not only avoid self-harm from endogenous SMs but also deliver specific SMs at the right time to the right tissue requiring biochemical aid. This review highlights functions of BGCs beyond the enzymatic assembly of SMs, considering the timing and location of SM production and other proteins in the clusters that control SM activity. Specifically, self-protection is provided by both BGC-encoded mechanisms and non-BGC subcellular containment of toxic SM precursors; delivery and timing is orchestrated through cellular trafficking patterns and stress- and developmental-responsive transcriptional programs.",

Recent advances in DNA sequencing have resulted in an explosion of microbial genomes. A virtual survey of the GenBank and JGI genome databases revealed 87 enediyne biosynthetic gene clusters from 78 bacteria strains, implying that enediynes are more common than previously thought. Here we report the construction and analysis of an enediyne genome neighborhood network (GNN) as a high-throughput approach to analyze secondary metabolite gene clusters. Analysis of the enediyne GNN facilitated rapid gene cluster annotation, revealed genetic trends in enediyne biosynthetic gene clusters resulting in a simple prediction scheme to determine 9- versus 10-membered enediyne gene clusters, and supported a genomic-based strain prioritization method for enediyne discovery.",

Analysis of the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of microbisporicin, which contains two unique post-translationally modified residues (5-chlorotryptophan and 3, 4-dihydroxyproline), has revealed an unusual regulatory mechanism that involves a pathway-specific extracytoplasmic function sigma factor (MibX)/anti-sigma factor (MibW) complex and an additional transcriptional regulator MibR. A model for the regulation of microbisporicin biosynthesis derived from transcriptional, mutational and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses suggests that MibR, which contains a C-terminal DNA-binding domain found in the LuxR family of transcriptional activators, functions as an essential master regulator to trigger microbisporicin production while MibX and MibW induce feed-forward biosynthesis and producer immunity. Moreover, we demonstrate that initial expression of mibR, and thus microbisporicin production, is dependent on the ppGpp synthetase gene (relA) of M.âcorallina. In addition, we show that constitutive expression of either of the two positively acting regulatory genes, mibR or mibX, leads to precocious and enhanced microbisporicin production.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Recent genome sequencing efforts have led to the rapid accumulation of uncharacterized or \"orphaned\" secondary metabolic biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in public databases. This increase in DNA-sequenced big data has given rise to significant challenges in the applied field of natural product genome mining, including (i) how to prioritize the characterization of orphan BGCs and (ii) how to rapidly connect genes to biosynthesized small molecules. Here, we show that by correlating putative antibiotic resistance genes that encode target-modified proteins with orphan BGCs, we predict the biological function of pathway specific small molecules before they have been revealed in a process we call target-directed genome mining. By querying the pan-genome of 86 Salinispora bacterial genomes for duplicated house-keeping genes colocalized with natural product BGCs, we prioritized an orphan polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid BGC (tlm) with a putative fatty acid synthase resistance gene. We employed a new synthetic double-stranded DNA-mediated cloning strategy based on transformation-associated recombination to efficiently capture tlm and the related ttm BGCs directly from genomic DNA and to heterologously express them in Streptomyces hosts. We show the production of a group of unusual thiotetronic acid natural products, including the well-known fatty acid synthase inhibitor thiolactomycin that was first described over 30 years ago, yet never at the genetic level in regards to biosynthesis and autoresistance. This finding not only validates the target-directed genome mining strategy for the discovery of antibiotic producing gene clusters without a priori knowledge of the molecule synthesized but also paves the way for the investigation of novel enzymology involved in thiotetronic acid natural product biosynthesis.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Glycopeptides are considered antibiotics of last resort for the treatment of life-threatening infections caused by relevant Gram-positive human pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and Clostridium difficile. The emergence of glycopeptide-resistant clinical isolates, first among enterococci and then in staphylococci, has prompted research for second generation glycopeptides and a flurry of activity aimed at understanding resistance mechanisms and their evolution. Glycopeptides are glycosylated non-ribosomal peptides produced by a diverse group of soil actinomycetes. They target Gram-positive bacteria by binding to the acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (D-Ala-D-Ala) terminus of the growing peptidoglycan on the outer surface of the cytoplasmatic membrane. Glycopeptide-resistant organisms avoid such a fate by replacing the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus with D-alanyl-D-lactate (D-Ala-D-Lac) or D-alanyl-D-serine (D-Ala-D-Ser), thus markedly reducing antibiotic affinity for the cellular target. Resistance has manifested itself in enterococci and staphylococci largely through the expression of genes (named van) encoding proteins that reprogram cell wall biosynthesis and, thus, evade the action of the antibiotic. These resistance mechanisms were most likely co-opted from the glycopeptide producing actinomycetes, which use them to avoid suicide during antibiotic production, rather than being orchestrated by pathogen bacteria upon continued treatment. van-like gene clusters, similar to those described in enterococci, were in fact identified in many glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes, such as Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, which produces teicoplanin, and Streptomyces toyocaensis, which produces the A47934 glycopeptide. In this paper, we describe the natural and semi-synthetic glycopeptide antibiotics currently used as last resort drugs for Gram-positive infections and compare the van gene-based strategies of glycopeptide resistance among the pathogens and the producing actinomycetes. Particular attention is given to the strategy of immunity recently described in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727. Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 is the producer of A40926, which is the natural precursor of the second generation semi-synthetic glycopeptide dalbavancin, very recently approved for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. A thorough understanding of glycopeptide immunity in this producing microorganism may be particularly relevant to predict and eventually control the evolution of resistance that might arise following introduction of dalbavancin and other second generation glycopeptides into clinics.",

DepH from Chromobacterium violaceum No. 968 is an FAD-dependent enzyme responsible for catalyzing the disulfide bond formation of FK228, an anticancer prodrug approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here we report the crystal structures of DepH and DepH complexed with a substrate analogue S,S'-dimethyl FK228 at 1.82 Ã and 2.00 Ã, respectively. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that DepH, in contrast to the well characterized low molecular weight thioredoxin reductases (LMW TrxRs), is an NADP(+)-independent dithiol oxidase. DepH not only lacks a conserved GGGDXAXE motif necessary for NADP(+) binding in the canonical LMW TrxRs, but also contains a 11-residue sequence which physically impedes the binding of NADP(+). These observations explain the difference between NADP(+)-independent small molecule dithiol oxidases and NADP(+)-dependent thioredoxin reductases and provide insights for understanding the catalytic mechanism of dithiol oxidases involved in natural product biosynthesis.",

The Bacillus subtilis LiaRS (formerly YvqCE) two-component system is one of several antibiotic-sensing systems that coordinate the genetic response to cell wall-active antibiotics. Upon the addition of vancomycin or bacitracin, LiaRS autoregulates the liaIHGFSR operon. We have characterized the promoter of the lia operon and defined the cis-acting sequences necessary for antibiotic-inducible gene expression. A survey for compounds that act as inducers of the lia promoter revealed that it responds strongly to a subset of cell wall-active antibiotics that interfere with the lipid II cycle in the cytoplasmic membrane (bacitracin, nisin, ramoplanin, and vancomycin). Chemicals that perturb the cytoplasmic membrane, such as organic solvents, are also weak inducers. Thus, the reporter derived from P(liaI) (the liaI promoter) provides a tool for the detection and classification of antimicrobial compounds.",

In this study, we isolated LDBS in a BS heterologous producer <i>S. lividans</i> WJ2 upon the deletion of <i>blsL</i>, which encodes a S-Adenosyl methionine-dependent methyltransferase. Purified BlsL efficiently methylated LDBS at the delta N of beta-arginine to generate the ultimate intermediate LBS, but nearly didn't methylate DBS to final product BS.

Macrolides are composed of a macrocyclic lactone of different ring sizes, to which one or more deoxy-sugar or amino sugar residues are attached. Macrolides act as antibiotics by binding to bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and interfering with protein synthesis. The high affinity of macrolides for bacterial ribosomes, together with the highly conserved structure of ribosomes across virtually all of the bacterial species, is consistent with their broad-spectrum activity. Since the discovery of the progenitor macrolide, erythromycin, in 1950, many derivatives have been synthesised, leading to compounds with better bioavailability and acid stability and improved pharmacokinetics. These efforts led to the second generation of macrolides, including well-known members such as azithromycin and clarithromycin. Subsequently, in order to address increasing antibiotic resistance, a third generation of macrolides displaying improved activity against many macrolide resistant strains was developed. However, these improvements were accompanied with serious side effects, leading to disappointment and causing many researchers to stop working on macrolide derivatives, assuming that this procedure had reached the end. In contrast, a recent published breakthrough introduced a new chemical platform for synthesis and discovery of a wide range of diverse macrolide antibiotics. This chemical synthesis revolution, in combination with reduction in the side effects, namely, 'Ketek effects', has led to a macrolide renaissance, increasing the hope for novel and safe therapeutic agents to combat serious human infectious diseases.",

Some rhodococci are free-living, saprophytic bacteria; others are animal and plant pathogens. Recently, several studies have shown that their genomes encode putative pathways for the synthesis of a large number of specialized metabolites that are likely to be involved in microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. To systematically explore the specialized metabolic potential of this genus, we here performed a comprehensive analysis of the biosynthetic coding capacity across publicly available rhododoccal genomes, and compared these with those of several Mycobacterium strains as well as that of their mutual close relative Amycolicicoccus subflavus.<h4>Results</h4>Comparative genomic analysis shows that most predicted biosynthetic gene cluster families in these strains are clade-specific and lack any homology with gene clusters encoding the production of known natural products. Interestingly, many of these clusters appear to encode the biosynthesis of lipopeptides, which may play key roles in the diverse environments were rhodococci thrive, by acting as biosurfactants, pathogenicity factors or antimicrobials. We also identified several gene cluster families that are universally shared among all three genera, which therefore may have a more 'primary' role in their physiology. Inactivation of these clusters by mutagenesis might help to generate weaker strains that can be used as live vaccines.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The genus Rhodococcus thus provides an interesting target for natural product discovery, in view of its large and mostly uncharacterized biosynthetic repertoire, its relatively fast growth and the availability of effective genetic tools for its genomic modification.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Cedar-apple rust (<i>Gymnosporangium yamadai</i> Miyabe) is a fungal disease that causes substantial injury to apple trees and results in fruit with reduced size and quality and a lower commercial value. The molecular mechanisms underlying the primary and secondary metabolic effects of rust spots on the leaves of <i>Malus</i> apple cultivars are poorly understood. Using HPLC, we found that the contents of flavonoid compounds, especially anthocyanin and catechin, were significantly increased in rust-infected symptomatic tissue (RIT). The expression levels of structural genes and MYB transcription factors related to flavonoid biosynthesis were one- to seven-fold higher in the RIT. Among these genes, <i>CHS, DFR, ANS, FLS</i> and <i>MYB10</i> showed more than a 10-fold increase, suggesting that these genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in the RIT. Hormone concentration assays showed that the levels of abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ETH), jasmonate (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) were higher in the RIT and were consistent with the expression levels of <i>McNCED, McACS, McLOX</i> and <i>McNPR1</i>, respectively. Our study explored the complicated crosstalk of the signal transduction pathways of ABA, ETH, JA and SA; the primary metabolism of glucose, sucrose, fructose and sorbitol; and the secondary metabolism of flavonoids involved in the rust resistance of <i>Malus</i> crabapple leaves.",

        "pmc_abstract": "With the rise of multi-drug resistant pathogens and the decline in number of potential new antibiotics in development there is a fervent need to reinvigorate the natural products discovery pipeline. Most antibiotics are derived from secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms and plants. To avoid suicide, an antibiotic producer harbors resistance genes often found within the same biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) responsible for manufacturing the antibiotic. Existing mining tools are excellent at detecting BGCs or resistant genes in general, but provide little help in prioritizing and identifying gene clusters for compounds active against specific and novel targets. Here we introduce the 'Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker' (ARTS) available at https://arts.ziemertlab.com. ARTS allows for specific and efficient genome mining for antibiotics with interesting and novel targets. The aim of this web server is to automate the screening of large amounts of sequence data and to focus on the most promising strains that produce antibiotics with new modes of action. ARTS integrates target directed genome mining methods, antibiotic gene cluster predictions and 'essential gene screening' to provide an interactive page for rapid identification of known and putative targets in BGCs.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas mesoacidophila</i> ATCC 31433 is a Gram-negative bacterium, first isolated from Japanese soil samples, that produces the monobactam isosulfazecin and the Î²-lactam-potentiating bulgecins. To characterize the biosynthetic potential of <i>P. mesoacidophila</i> ATCC 31433, its complete genome was determined using single-molecule real-time DNA sequence analysis. The 7.8-Mb genome comprised four replicons, three chromosomal (each encoding rRNA) and one plasmid. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that <i>P. mesoacidophila</i> ATCC 31433 was misclassified at the time of its deposition and is a member of the <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex, most closely related to <i>Burkholderia ubonensis</i> The sequenced genome shows considerable additional biosynthetic potential; known gene clusters for malleilactone, ornibactin, isosulfazecin, alkylhydroxyquinoline, and pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis and several uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters for polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and other metabolites were identified. Furthermore, <i>P. mesoacidophila</i> ATCC 31433 harbors many genes associated with environmental resilience and antibiotic resistance and was resistant to a range of antibiotics and metal ions. In summary, this bioactive strain should be designated <i>B. cepacia</i> complex strain ATCC 31433, pending further detailed taxonomic characterization.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> This work reports the complete genome sequence of <i>Pseudomonas mesoacidophila</i> ATCC 31433, a known producer of bioactive compounds. Large numbers of both known and novel biosynthetic gene clusters were identified, indicating that <i>P. mesoacidophila</i> ATCC 31433 is an untapped resource for discovery of novel bioactive compounds. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that <i>P. mesoacidophila</i> ATCC 31433 is in fact a member of the <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex, most closely related to the species <i>Burkholderia ubonensis</i> Further investigation of the classification and biosynthetic potential of <i>P. mesoacidophila</i> ATCC 31433 is warranted.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Nocamycins I and II, produced by the rare actinomycete Saccharothrix syringae, belong to the tetramic acid family natural products. Nocamycins show potent antimicrobial activity and they hold great potential for antibacterial agent design. However, up to now, little is known about the exact biosynthetic mechanism of nocamycin.<h4>Results</h4>In this report, we identified the gene cluster responsible for nocamycin biosynthesis from S. syringae and generated new nocamycin derivatives by manipulating its gene cluster. The biosynthetic gene cluster for nocamycin contains a 61Â kb DNA locus, consisting of 21 open reading frames (ORFs). Five type I polyketide synthases (NcmAI, NcmAII, NcmAIII, NcmAIV, NcmAV) and a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NcmB) are proposed to be involved in synthesis of the backbone structure, a Dieckmann cyclase NcmC catalyze the releasing of linear chain and the formation of tetramic acid moiety, five enzymes (NcmEDGOP) are related to post-tailoring steps, and five enzymes (NcmNJKIM) function as regulators. Targeted inactivation of ncmB led to nocamycin production being completely abolished, which demonstrates that this gene cluster is involved in nocamycin biosynthesis. To generate new nocamycin derivatives, the gene ncmG, encoding for a cytochrome P450 oxidase, was inactivated. Two new nocamycin derivatives nocamycin III and nocamycin IV were isolated from the ncmG deletion mutant strain and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data analyses. Based on bioinformatics analysis and new derivatives isolated from gene inactivation mutant strains, a biosynthetic pathway of nocamycins was proposed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings provide the basis for further understanding of nocamycin biosynthetic mechanism, and set the stage to rationally engineer new nocamycin derivatives via combinatorial biosynthesis strategy.",

We recently discovered the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for TLM from the marine bacterium Salinispora pacifica CNS-863. Here, we report the investigation of TLM biosynthetic logic through mutagenesis and comparative metabolic analyses. Our results revealed that only four genes (tlmF, tlmG, tlmH, and tlmI) are required for the construction of the characteristic Î³-thiolactone skeleton of this class of antibiotics. We further showed that the cytochrome P450 TlmF does not directly participate in sulfur insertion and C-S bond formation chemistry but rather in the construction of the five-membered thiolactone ring as, upon its deletion, we observed the alternative production of the six-membered Î´-thiolactomycin.

        "pmc_abstract": "The Bacillus cereus group of bacteria includes seven closely related species, three of which, B. anthracis, B. cereus and B. thuringiensis, are pathogens of humans, animals and/or insects. Preliminary investigations into the transport capabilities of different bacterial lineages suggested that genes encoding putative efflux systems were unusually abundant in the B. cereus group compared to other bacteria. To explore the drug efflux potential of the B. cereus group all putative efflux systems were identified in the genomes of prototypical strains of B. cereus, B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis using our Transporter Automated Annotation Pipeline. More than 90 putative drug efflux systems were found within each of these strains, accounting for up to 2.7% of their protein coding potential. Comparative analyses demonstrated that the efflux systems are highly conserved between these species; 70-80% of the putative efflux pumps were shared between all three strains studied. Furthermore, 82% of the putative efflux system proteins encoded by the prototypical B. cereus strain ATCC 14579 (type strain) were found to be conserved in at least 80% of 169 B. cereus group strains that have high quality genome sequences available. However, only a handful of these efflux pumps have been functionally characterized. Deletion of individual efflux pump genes from B. cereus typically had little impact to drug resistance phenotypes or the general fitness of the strains, possibly because of the large numbers of alternative efflux systems that may have overlapping substrate specificities. Therefore, to gain insight into the possible transport functions of efflux systems in B. cereus, we undertook large-scale qRT-PCR analyses of efflux pump gene expression following drug shocks and other stress treatments. Clustering of gene expression changes identified several groups of similarly regulated systems that may have overlapping drug resistance functions. In this article we review current knowledge of the small molecule efflux pumps encoded by the B. cereus group and suggest the likely functions of numerous uncharacterised pumps.",

In the last years, a growing interest to study the relationship between MS and psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, has emerged obtaining conflicting results. Diet-induced MS rat models have only examined the effects of high-fat or mixed cafeteria diets to a limited extent. We explored whether an anxiety-like behavior was associated with MS in non-stressed rats chronically submitted to a high-sucrose diet (20% sucrose in drinking water) using three different anxiety paradigms: the shock-probe/burying test (SPBT), the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the open-field test (OFT). Behaviorally, the high-sucrose diet group showed an increase in burying behavior in the SPBT. Also, these animals displayed both avoidance to explore the central part of the arena and a significant increase in freezing behavior in the OFT and lack of effects in the EPM. Also, high-sucrose diet group showed signs of an MS-like condition: significant increases in body weight and body mass index, abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia. Plasma leptin and resistin levels were also increased. No changes in plasma corticosterone levels were found. These results indicate that rats under a 24-weeks high-sucrose diet develop an MS associated with an anxiety-like behavior. Although the mechanisms underlying this behavioral outcome remain to be investigated, the role of leptin is emphasized.",

Curiously, the extra arm of the <i>S. chrysomallus</i> gene cluster turned out to perfectly match the single arm of the <i>S. antibioticus</i> gene cluster in the same order of orthologues including the the presence of two pseudogenes, <i>scacmM</i> and <i>scacmN</i>, encoding a cytochrome P450 and its ferredoxin, respectively. Orthologues of the latter genes were both missing in the principal arm of the <i>S. chrysomallus acm</i> C gene cluster. All orthologues of the extra arm showed a G +C-contents different from that of their counterparts in the principal arm. Moreover, the similarities of translation products from the extra arm were all higher to the corresponding translation products of orthologue genes from the <i>S. antibioticus acm X</i> gene cluster than to those encoded by the principal arm of their own gene cluster. This suggests that the duplicated structure of the <i>S. chrysomallus acm</i> C biosynthetic gene cluster evolved from previous fusion between two one-armed <i>acm</i> gene clusters each from a different genetic background. However, while <i>scacmM</i> and <i>scacmN</i> in the extra arm of the <i>S. chrysomallus acm</i> C gene cluster are mutated and therefore are non-functional, their orthologues <i>saacmM</i> and <i>saacmN</i> in the <i>S. antibioticus acm</i> C gene cluster show no defects seemingly encoding active enzymes with functions specific for Acm X biosynthesis. Both <i>acm</i> biosynthetic gene clusters lack a kynurenine-3-monooxygenase gene necessary for biosynthesis of 3-hydroxy-4-methylanthranilic acid, the building block of the Acm chromophore, which suggests participation of a genome-encoded relevant monooxygenase during Acm biosynthesis in both <i>S. chrysomallus</i> and <i>S. antibioticus</i>.",

Quantitative determination of jadomycin production with the <i>jadL</i> disrupted mutant did not show a significant decrease in production in comparison to the wildtype strain, as determined by HPLC and by tandem mass spectrometry.

The decreases in CRGs, ARGs, and <i>intI1</i> were positively correlated with the exchangeable Cu levels. The bacterial community could be grouped according to the composting time under different treatments, where the high concentration of copper had a more persistent effect on the bacterial community. Network analysis determined that the co-occurrence of CRGs, ARGs, and <i>intI1</i>, and the bacterial community were the main contributors to the changes in CRGs, ARG, and <i>intl1</i>.

The deletion of the <i>pokOIV</i> oxygenase gene led to a non-polyketomycin-producing mutant. Instead, novel compounds were produced by the mutant, which have not been detected before in the wild type strain. Four different compounds were identified and named foxicins A-D. Foxicin A was isolated and its structure was elucidated as an unusual nitrogen-containing quinone derivative using various spectroscopic methods. Through genome mining, the foxicin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in the draft genome sequence of <i>S. diastatochromogenes</i>.

Foxicin A acts as a siderophore through interacting with ferric ions. Furthermore, it is a weak inhibitor of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> aerobic respiratory chain and shows moderate antibiotic activity.

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Black widow spiders are infamous for their neurotoxic venom, which can cause extreme and long-lasting pain. This unusual venom is dominated by latrotoxins and latrodectins, two protein families virtually unknown outside of the black widow genus Latrodectus, that are difficult to study given the paucity of spider genomes. Using tissue-, sex- and stage-specific expression data, we analyzed the recently sequenced genome of the house spider (Parasteatoda tepidariorum), a close relative of black widows, to investigate latrotoxin and latrodectin diversity, expression and evolution.<h4>Results</h4>We discovered at least 47 latrotoxin genes in the house spider genome, many of which are tandem-arrayed. Latrotoxins vary extensively in predicted structural domains and expression, implying their significant functional diversification. Phylogenetic analyses show latrotoxins have substantially duplicated after the Latrodectus/Parasteatoda split and that they are also related to proteins found in endosymbiotic bacteria. Latrodectin genes are less numerous than latrotoxins, but analyses show their recruitment for venom function from neuropeptide hormone genes following duplication, inversion and domain truncation. While latrodectins and other peptides are highly expressed in house spider and black widow venom glands, latrotoxins account for a far smaller percentage of house spider venom gland expression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The house spider genome sequence provides novel insights into the evolution of venom toxins once considered unique to black widows. Our results greatly expand the size of the latrotoxin gene family, reinforce its narrow phylogenetic distribution, and provide additional evidence for the lateral transfer of latrotoxins between spiders and bacterial endosymbionts. Moreover, we strengthen the evidence for the evolution of latrodectin venom genes from the ecdysozoan Ion Transport Peptide (ITP)/Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (CHH) neuropeptide superfamily. The lower expression of latrotoxins in house spiders relative to black widows, along with the absence of a vertebrate-targeting Î±-latrotoxin gene in the house spider genome, may account for the extreme potency of black widow venom.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Riboflavin is the precursor of important redox cofactors such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide, required for several biological processes. <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, a pathogenic bacterium responsible for the cholera disease, possesses the ability to biosynthesize de novo as well as to uptake riboflavin through the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway (RBP) and the RibN importer, respectively. The intra-organism relationship between riboflavin biosynthesis and uptake functions has not been studied.<h4>Results</h4>This work determined the transcriptional organization of RBP genes and <i>ribN</i> in <i>V. cholerae</i> through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and analyzed their expression when growing with or without extracellular riboflavin using real time PCR. The RBP is organized in three transcriptional units, the major one containing <i>ribD, ribE, ribA</i> and <i>ribH</i> together with genes involved in functions not directly related to riboflavin biosynthesis such as <i>nrdR</i> and <i>nusB</i>. In addition, two independent monocistronic units contain <i>ribA2</i> and <i>ribB</i>, the later conserving a putative FMN riboswitch. The <i>ribN</i> gene is encoded in operon with a gene coding for a predicted outer membrane protein and a gene encoding a protein with a glutaredoxin domain. Regulation analysis showed that among these transcriptional units, only <i>ribB</i> is negatively regulated by riboflavin and that its repression depends on the RibN riboflavin importer. Moreover, external riboflavin highly induced <i>ribB</i> transcription in a <i>ÎribN</i> strain. Also, a genomic database search found a negative correlation between the presence of <i>nrdR</i> and <i>nusB</i> and the FMN riboswitch in bacterial RBP operons.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Growing in the presence of riboflavin downregulates only a single element among the transcriptional units of riboflavin supply pathways. Thus, endogenous riboflavin biosynthesis seems to be negatively regulated by extracellular riboflavin through its specific effect on transcription of <i>ribB</i> in <i>V. cholerae</i>.",

Bengamide A was first reported in 1986 from the sponge Jaspis cf. coriacea, and bengamide-containing sponges have been gathered from many biogeographic sites. In 2005, a terrestrial Gram-negative bacterium, Myxococcus virescens, was added as a source for bengamides. Biological activity data using varying bengamide-based scaffolds has enabled fine-tuning of structure-activity relationships. Molecular target finding contributed to the creation of a synthetic \"lead\" compound, LAF389, that was the subject of a phase I anticancer clinical trial. Despite clinical trial termination, the bengamide compound class is still attracting worldwide attention. Future breakthroughs based on the bengamide scaffold are possible and could build on their nanomolar in vitro and positive in vivo antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties. Bengamide molecular targets include methionine aminopeptidases (MetAP1 and MetAP2) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ÎºB). A mixed PKS/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster appears to be responsible for creation of the bengamides. This review highlights that the bengamides have driven inspirational studies and that they will remain relevant for future research, even 30 years after the discovery of the first structures.",

While great progress has been made in describing this diversity, it remains difficult to identify the phylogenetic and ecological characteristics that delineate groups of bacteria that possess species-like properties. One major challenge associated with species delineations is that not all shared genes have the same evolutionary history, and thus the choice of loci can have a major impact on phylogenetic reconstruction. Sequencing the genomes of large numbers of closely related strains provides new opportunities to distinguish ancestral from acquired alleles and assess the effects of recombination on phylogenetic inference. Here we analyzed the genomes of 119 strains of the marine actinomycete genus Salinispora, which is currently comprised of three named species that share 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity. While 63% of the core genome showed evidence of recombination, this had no effect on species-level phylogenomic resolution. Recombination did however blur intra-species relationships and biogeographic resolution. The genome-wide average nucleotide identity provided a new perspective on Salinispora diversity, revealing as many as seven new species. Patterns of orthologous group distributions reveal a genetic basis to delineation the candidate taxa and insight into the levels of genetic cohesion associated with bacterial species.",

        "pmc_abstract": "FL118 is a novel camptothecin (CPT) analogue that possesses exceptional antitumor efficacy in human tumor animal models. To date, two CPT analogues, irinotecan and topotecan, have been approved by the FDA for cancer treatment. FL118 exhibits superior antitumor activity over irinotecan and topotecan, and effectively overcomes the irinotecan- or topotecan-resistant human tumors in animal models. Accordingly, FL118 selectively inhibits the expression of multiple cancer-associated proteins (survivin, Mcl-1, XIAP, cIAP2, MdmX). However, FL118 has hematopoietic toxicity similar to irinotecan and topotecan, suggesting that FL118's hematopoietic toxicity may share a mechanism similar to irinotecan and topotecan. It is known that CPTs including irinotecan, SN-38 (active metabolite of irinotecan) and topotecan are topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors. However, the evidence from our studies failed to reveal that FL118 is a better Top1 inhibitor than SN-38. It was documented that Top1 expression level is positively associated with CPTs' sensitivity. Low Top1 expression links to CPTs' resistance. In contrast to these findings, we found that human colorectal tumor sensitivity to FL118 is irrelevant to the expression level of Top1 protein. FL118 can show high antitumor efficacy in Top1-negative tumors, while Top1 highly positive tumors can exhibit FL118 resistance. This suggests that the presence of Top1 target is not critical for FL118 antitumor activity. In other words, targeting Top1 by FL118 may not play a major role for its antitumor efficacy. However, studies indicate that FL118 can bind to, and inhibit Top1 activity. This raises the possibility that inhibition of Top1 by FL118 may predominantly be involved in hematopoietic toxicity, but not in FL118 antitumor activity. In this article, we will summarize existing observations and provide our up-to-date research results to support our opinion on this important topic.",

Here we describe the X-ray crystal structures of GtmA-apo (1.66 Ã), GtmA complexed to <i>S</i>-adenosylhomocysteine (1.33 Ã) and GtmA complexed to <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (2.28 Ã), providing mechanistic insights into this important biotransformation. We further reveal that simultaneous elimination of the ability of <i>A. fumigatus</i> to dissipate highly reactive dithiol gliotoxin, via deletion of GliT and GtmA, results in the most significant hypersensitivity to exogenous gliotoxin observed to date. Indeed, quantitative proteomic analysis of Î<i>gliT</i>::Î<i>gtmA</i> reveals an uncontrolled over-activation of the <i>gli</i>-cluster upon gliotoxin exposure. The data presented herein reveal, for the first time, the extreme risk associated with intracellular dithiol gliotoxin biosynthesis-in the absence of an efficient dismutation capacity. Significantly, a previously concealed protective role for GtmA and functionality of ETP <i>bis</i>-thiomethylation as an ancestral protection strategy against dithiol compounds is now evident.",

Lanthipeptides that display antimicrobial activity are called lantibiotics. The post-translational modification reactions of lanthipeptides include dehydration of Ser and Thr residues to dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, a transformation that is carried out in three unique ways in different classes of lanthipeptides. In a cyclization process, Cys residues then attack the dehydrated residues to generate the lanthionine and methyllanthionine thioether cross-linked amino acids from which lanthipeptides derive their name. The resulting polycyclic peptides have constrained conformations that confer their biological activities. After installation of the characteristic thioether cross-links, tailoring enzymes introduce additional post-translational modifications that are unique to each lanthipeptide and that fine-tune their activities and/or stability. This review focuses on studies published over the past decade that have provided much insight into the mechanisms of the enzymes that carry out the post-translational modifications.",

Surprisingly, the new mutation was an in-frame DNA deletion in the genes SCO4597 and SCO4598, resulting in formation of the hybrid gene linR. SCO4597 and SCO4598 encode two histidine kinases, which together with SCO4596, encoding a response regulator, constitute a unique two-component system. Sequence analysis indicated that these three genes and their arrangement patterns are ubiquitous among all Streptomyces genomes sequenced to date, suggesting these genes play important regulatory roles. Gene replacement showed that this mutation was responsible for the high level of lincomycin resistance, the overproduction of the antibiotic actinorhodin, and the enhanced morphological differentiation of this strain. Moreover, heterologous expression of the hybrid gene linR in Escherichia coli conferred resistance to lincomycin in this organism. Introduction of the hybrid gene linR in various Streptomyces strains by gene engineering technology may widely activate and/or enhance antibiotic production.",

However, overproduction of surfactin in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MT45 was observed at a titre of 2.93âg/l, which is equivalent to half of the maximum biomass. To systemically unravel this efficient biosynthetic process, the genome and transcriptome of this bacterium were compared with those of B. amyloliquefaciens type strain DSM7<sup>T</sup>. MT45 possesses a smaller genome while containing more unique transporters and resistance-associated genes. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed notable enrichment of the surfactin synthesis pathway in MT45, including central carbon metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis to provide sufficient quantities of building precursors. Most importantly, the modular surfactin synthase overexpressed (9 to 49-fold) in MT45 compared to DSM7<sup>T</sup> suggested efficient surfactin assembly and resulted in the overproduction of surfactin. Furthermore, based on the expression trends observed in the transcriptome, there are multiple potential regulatory genes mediating the expression of surfactin synthase. Thus, the results of the present study provide new insights regarding the synthesis and regulation of surfactin in high-producing strain and enrich the genomic and transcriptomic resources available for B. amyloliquefaciens.",

Accordingly, a diverse collection of enzyme catalysts to install and remove halogens from organic scaffolds has evolved in nature. Accounting for the different chemical properties of the four halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) and the diversity and chemical reactivity of their organic substrates, enzymes performing biosynthetic and degradative halogenation chemistry utilize numerous mechanistic strategies involving oxidation, reduction, and substitution. Biosynthetic halogenation reactions range from simple aromatic substitutions to stereoselective C-H functionalizations on remote carbon centers and can initiate the formation of simple to complex ring structures. Dehalogenating enzymes, on the other hand, are best known for removing halogen atoms from man-made organohalogens, yet also function naturally, albeit rarely, in metabolic pathways. This review details the scope and mechanism of nature's halogenation and dehalogenation enzymatic strategies, highlights gaps in our understanding, and posits where new advances in the field might arise in the near future.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are characterized by the thioether cross-linked bisamino acids lanthionine (Lan) and methyllanthionine (MeLan). Duramycin contains 19 amino acids, including one Lan and two MeLans, an unusual lysinoalanine (Lal) bridge formed from the Îµ-amino group of lysine 19 and a serine residue at position 6, and an erythro-3-hydroxy-l-aspartic acid at position 15. These modifications are important for the interactions of duramycin with its biological target, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Based on the binding affinity and specificity for PE, duramycin has been investigated as a potential therapeutic, as a molecular probe to investigate the role and localization of PE in biological systems, and to block viral entry into mammalian cells. In this study, we identified the duramycin biosynthetic gene cluster by genome sequencing of Streptomyces cinnamoneus ATCC 12686 and investigated the dur biosynthetic machinery by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli In addition, the analog duramycin C, containing six amino acid changes compared to duramycin, was successfully generated in E. coli The substrate recognition motif of DurX, an Î±-ketoglutarate/iron(II)-dependent hydroxylase that carries out the hydroxylation of aspartate 15 of the precursor peptide DurA, was also investigated using mutagenesis of the DurA peptide. Both in vivo and in vitro results demonstrated that Gly16 is important for DurX activity.<h4>Importance</h4>Duramycin is a natural product produced by certain bacteria that binds to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Because PE is involved in many cellular processes, duramycin is an antibiotic that kills bacteria, but it has also been used as a molecular probe to detect PE and monitor its localization in mammalian cells and even whole organisms, and it was recently shown to display broad-spectrum inhibition of viral entry into host cells. In addition, the molecule has been evaluated as treatment for cystic fibrosis. We report here the genes that are involved in duramycin biosynthesis, and we produced duramycin by expressing those genes in Escherichia coli We show that duramycin analogs can also be produced. The ability to access duramycin and analogs by production in E. coli opens opportunities to improve duramycin as an antibiotic, PE probe, antiviral, or cystic fibrosis therapeutic.",

Some of the most dramatic structural alterations in natural product biosynthesis occur through oxidative cyclization. In this Review, we examine the different strategies used by nature to create new intra(inter)molecular bonds via redox chemistry. This Review will cover both oxidation- and reduction-enabled cyclization mechanisms, with an emphasis on the former. Radical cyclizations catalyzed by P450, nonheme iron, Î±-KG-dependent oxygenases, and radical SAM enzymes are discussed to illustrate the use of molecular oxygen and S-adenosylmethionine to forge new bonds at unactivated sites via one-electron manifolds. Nonradical cyclizations catalyzed by flavin-dependent monooxygenases and NAD(P)H-dependent reductases are covered to show the use of two-electron manifolds in initiating cyclization reactions. The oxidative installations of epoxides and halogens into acyclic scaffolds to drive subsequent cyclizations are separately discussed as examples of \"disappearing\" reactive handles. Last, oxidative rearrangement of rings systems, including contractions and expansions, will be covered.",

        "pmc_abstract": "DNA glycosylases are important editing enzymes that protect genomic stability by excising chemically modified nucleobases that alter normal DNA metabolism. These enzymes have been known only to initiate base excision repair of small adducts by extrusion from the DNA helix. However, recent reports have described both vertebrate and microbial DNA glycosylases capable of unhooking highly toxic interstrand cross-links (ICLs) and bulky minor groove adducts normally recognized by Fanconi anemia and nucleotide excision repair machinery, although the mechanisms of these activities are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of <i>Streptomyces sahachiroi</i> AlkZ (previously Orf1), a bacterial DNA glycosylase that protects its host by excising ICLs derived from azinomycin B (AZB), a potent antimicrobial and antitumor genotoxin. AlkZ adopts a unique fold in which three tandem winged helix-turn-helix motifs scaffold a positively charged concave surface perfectly shaped for duplex DNA. Through mutational analysis, we identified two glutamine residues and a Î²-hairpin within this putative DNA-binding cleft that are essential for catalytic activity. Additionally, we present a molecular docking model for how this active site can unhook either or both sides of an AZB ICL, providing a basis for understanding the mechanisms of base excision repair of ICLs. Given the prevalence of this protein fold in pathogenic bacteria, this work also lays the foundation for an emerging role of DNA repair in bacteria-host pathogenesis.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Erythromycin and its analogs are used to treat respiratory tract and other infections. The broad use of these antibiotics during the last 5 decades has led to resistance that can range from 20% to over 70% in certain parts of the world. Efforts to find macrolides that were active against macrolide-resistant strains led to the development of erythromycin analogs with alkyl-aryl side chains that mimicked the sugar side chain of 16-membered macrolides, such as tylosin. Further modifications were made to improve the potency of these molecules by removal of the cladinose sugar to obtain a smaller molecule, a modification that was learned from an older macrolide, pikromycin. A keto group was introduced after removal of the cladinose sugar to make the new ketolide subclass. Only one ketolide, telithromycin, received marketing authorization but because of severe adverse events, it is no longer widely used. Failure to identify the structure-relationship responsible for this clinical toxicity led to discontinuation of many ketolides that were in development. One that did complete clinical development, cethromycin, did not meet clinical efficacy criteria and therefore did not receive marketing approval. Work on developing new macrolides was re-initiated after showing that inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by the imidazolyl-pyridine moiety on the side chain of telithromycin was likely responsible for the severe adverse events. Solithromycin is a fourth-generation macrolide that has a fluorine at the 2-position, and an alkyl-aryl side chain that is different from telithromycin. Solithromycin interacts at three sites on the bacterial ribosome, has activity against strains resistant to older macrolides (including telithromycin), and is mostly bactericidal. Pharmaceutical scientists involved in the development of macrolide antibiotics have learned from the teachings of Professor Satoshi Omura and progress in this field was not possible without his endeavors.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Extracytoplasmic function (ECF) Ï factors have roles related to cell envelope and/or cell membrane functions, in addition to other cellular functions. Without cell-surface stresses, ECF Ï factors are sequestered by the cognate anti-Ï factor, leading to inactivation and the resultant repression of regulons due to the inhibition of transcription of their own genes. <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> has seven ECF Ï factors including Ï<sup>X</sup> and Ï<sup>M</sup> that transcribe their own structural genes. Here, we report that glucose addition to the medium induced <i>sigX</i> and <i>sigM</i> transcription independent of their anti-Ï factors. This induction was dependent on an intracellular acetyl-CoA pool. Transposon mutagenesis searching for the mutants showing no induction of <i>sigX</i> and <i>sigM</i> revealed that the <i>cshA</i> gene encoding DEAD-box RNA helicase is required for gene induction. Global analysis of the acetylome in <i>B. subtilis</i> showed CshA has two acetylated lysine residues. We found that in a <i>cshA</i> mutant with acetylation-abolishing K to R exchange mutations, glucose induction of <i>sigX</i> and <i>sigM</i> was abolished and that glucose addition stimulated acetylation of CshA in the wild type strain. Thus, we present a model wherein glucose addition results in a larger acetyl-CoA pool, probably leading to increased levels of acetylated CshA. CshA is known to associate with RNA polymerase (RNAP), and thus RNAP with acetylated CshA could stimulate the autoregulation of <i>sigX</i> and <i>sigM</i>. This is a unique model showing a functional link between nutritional signals and the basal transcription machinery.",

Their unparalleled structural and chemical diversities provide a basis to investigate fundamental biological processes while providing access to a tremendous amount of chemical space. There is a pressing need for novel antibiotics with new mode of actions to combat the growing challenge of multidrug resistant pathogens. This review begins with the pioneering discovery and biological activities of platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN), two antibacterial natural products isolated from Streptomyces platensis. The elucidation of their unique biochemical mode of action, structure-activity relationships, and pharmacokinetics is presented to highlight key aspects of their biological activities. It then presents an overview of how microbial genomics has impacted the field of PTM and PTN and revealed paradigm-shifting discoveries in terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and antibiotic and antidiabetic therapies. It concludes with a discussion covering the future perspectives of PTM and PTN in regard to natural products discovery, bacterial diterpenoid biosynthesis, and the pharmaceutical promise of PTM and PTN as antibiotics and for the treatment of metabolic disorders. PTM and PTN have inspired new discoveries in chemistry, biology, enzymology, and medicine and will undoubtedly continue to do so.",

Furthermore, these genetic engineering experiments have allowed the generation of novel PM100117/18 analogues. Deletion of putative glycosyltranferase genes and additional genes presumably involved in late biosynthesis steps of the three 2,6-dideoxysugars appended to the PM100117/18 polyketide skeleton, resulted in the generation of a series of intermediates and novel derivatives.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Isolation and identification of the novel compounds constitutes an important contribution to our knowledge on PM100117/18 glycosylation, and set the basis for further characterization of specific enzymatic reactions, additional genetic engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis approaches.",

We previously showed that TM84 employs a unique tRNA-dependent mechanism to inhibit leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), while the TM84-producer prevents self-poisoning by expressing a resistant LeuRS AgnB2. We now identify a mechanism by which the antibiotic-producing microbe resists its own toxin. Using a combination of structural, biochemical and biophysical approaches, we show that AgnB2 evolved structural changes so as to resist the antibiotic by eliminating the tRNA-dependence of TM84 binding. Mutagenesis of key resistance determinants results in mutants adopting an antibiotic-sensitive phenotype.

Herein, we present a simple and rapid strategy for direct cloning based heterologous expression of biosynthetic pathways in B. subtilis via Red/ET recombineering, using a 5.2âkb specific direct cloning vector carrying homologous sequences to the amyE gene in B. subtilis and CcdB counterselection marker.

The gene cluster for bacillomycin was successfully expressed in the heterologous host, although edeine production was not detectable.

        "pmc_abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa defies eradication by antibiotics and is responsible for acute and chronic human infections due to a wide variety of virulence factors. Currently, it is believed that MvfR (PqsR) controls the expression of many of these factors indirectly via the pqs and phnAB operons. Here we provide strong evidence that MvfR may also bind and directly regulate the expression of additional 35 loci across the P. aeruginosa genome, including major regulators and virulence factors, such as the quorum sensing (QS) regulators lasR and rhlR, and genes involved in protein secretion, translation, and response to oxidative stress. We show that these anti-oxidant systems, AhpC-F, AhpB-TrxB2 and Dps, are critical for P. aeruginosa survival to reactive oxygen species and antibiotic tolerance. Considering that MvfR regulated compounds generate reactive oxygen species, this indicates a tightly regulated QS self-defense anti-poisoning system. These findings also challenge the current hierarchical regulation model of P. aeruginosa QS systems by revealing new interconnections between them that suggest a circular model. Moreover, they uncover a novel role for MvfR in self-defense that favors antibiotic tolerance and cell survival, further demonstrating MvfR as a highly desirable anti-virulence target.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Bacterial fatty acid synthesis is essential for many pathogens and different from the mammalian counterpart. These features make bacterial fatty acid synthesis a desirable target for antibiotic discovery. The structural divergence of the conserved enzymes and the presence of different isozymes catalyzing the same reactions in the pathway make bacterial fatty acid synthesis a narrow spectrum target rather than the traditional broad spectrum target. Furthermore, bacterial fatty acid synthesis inhibitors are single-targeting, rather than multi-targeting like traditional monotherapeutic, broad-spectrum antibiotics. The single-targeting nature of bacterial fatty acid synthesis inhibitors makes overcoming fast-developing, target-based resistance a necessary consideration for antibiotic development. Target-based resistance can be overcome through multi-targeting inhibitors, a cocktail of single-targeting inhibitors, or by making the single targeting inhibitor sufficiently high affinity through a pathogen selective approach such that target-based mutants are still susceptible to therapeutic concentrations of drug. Many of the pathogens requiring new antibiotic treatment options encode for essential bacterial fatty acid synthesis enzymes. This review will evaluate the most promising targets in bacterial fatty acid metabolism for antibiotic therapeutics development and review the potential and challenges in advancing each of these targets to the clinic and circumventing target-based resistance.

Pathways for the main types of this modification, the N- and O-glycosylation, can be found in all three domains of life-the Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea-thereby following common principles, which are valid also for lipopolysaccharides, lipooligosaccharides and glycopolymers. Thus, studies on any glycoconjugate can unravel novel facets of the still incompletely understood fundamentals of protein N- and O-glycosylation. While it is estimated that more than two-thirds of all eukaryotic proteins would be glycosylated, no such estimate is available for prokaryotic glycoproteins, whose understanding is lagging behind, mainly due to the enormous variability of their glycan structures and variations in the underlying glycosylation processes. Combining glycan structural information with bioinformatic, genetic, biochemical and enzymatic data has opened up an avenue for in-depth analyses of glycosylation processes as a basis for glycoengineering endeavours. Here, the common themes of glycosylation are conceptualised for the major classes of prokaryotic (i.e. bacterial and archaeal) glycoconjugates, with a special focus on glycosylated cell-surface proteins. We describe the current knowledge of biosynthesis and importance of these glycoconjugates in selected pathogenic and beneficial microbes.",

We screened a transposon mutagenesis library from Pseudomonas acidophila ATCC 31363 and isolated a sulfazecin-deficient mutant that revealed a gene cluster encoding two non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), a methyltransferase, a sulfotransferase, and a dioxygenase. Three modules and an aberrant C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain are distributed across the two NRPSs. Biochemical examination of the adenylation (A) domains provided evidence that L-2,3-diaminopropionate, not L-serine as previously thought, is the direct source of the Î²-lactam ring of sulfazecin. ATP/PPi exchange assay also revealed an unusual substrate selectivity shift of one A domain when expressed with or without the immediately upstream condensation domain. Gene inactivation analysis defined a cluster of 13 open reading frames sufficient for sulfazecin production, precursor synthesis, self-resistance, and regulation. The identification of a key intermediate supported a proposed NRPS-mediated mechanism of sulfazecin biosynthesis and Î²-lactam ring formation distinct from the nocardicins, another NRPS-derived subclass of monocyclic Î²-lactam. These findings will serve as the basis for further biosynthetic research and potential engineering of these important antibiotics.",

In defining its superior use, we have followed the recent advances that have been made in producing CRISPR/Cas9 as a therapy of choice. We also provide important genetic mutations where CRISPRs can be repurposed to create adaptive immunity to fight carcinomas and edit genetic mutations causing it. Meanwhile, challenges to CRISPR technology are also discussed with emphasis on ability of pathogens to evolve against CRISPRs. We follow the recent developments on the function of CRISPRs with different carriers which can efficiently deliver it to target cells; furthermore, analogous technologies are also discussed along CRISPRs, including zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). Moreover, progress in clinical applications of CRISPR therapeutics is reviewed; in effect, patients can have lower morbidity and/or mortality from the therapeutic method with least possible side-effects.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) is essential for removing the DNA supercoiling generated during replication and transcription. Anticancer drugs like camptothecin (CPT) and its clinical derivatives exert their cytotoxicity by reversibly trapping Top1 in covalent complexes on the DNA (Top1cc). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) catalyses the addition of ADP-ribose polymers (PAR) onto itself and Top1. PARP inhibitors enhance the cytotoxicity of CPT in the clinical trials. However, the molecular mechanism by which PARylation regulates Top1 nuclear dynamics is not fully understood. Using live-cell imaging of enhanced green fluorescence tagged-human Top1, we show that PARP inhibitors (Veliparib, ABT-888) delocalize Top1 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, which is independent of Top1-PARP1 interaction. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and subsequent fitting of the data employing kinetic modelling we demonstrate that ABT-888 markedly increase CPT-induced bound/immobile fraction of Top1 (Top1cc) across the nuclear genome, suggesting Top1-PARylation counteracts CPT-induced stabilization of Top1cc. We further show Trp205 and Asn722 of Top1 are critical for subnuclear dynamics. Top1 mutant (N722S) was restricted to the nucleolus in the presence of CPT due to its deficiency in the accumulation of CPT-induced Top1-PARylation and Top1cc formation. This work identifies ADP-ribose polymers as key determinant for regulating Top1 subnuclear dynamics.",

The two-component system (TCS) VanRS activates vanHAX transcription upon sensing the presence of glycopeptides. Amycolatopsis balhimycina, the producer of the vancomycin-like glycopeptide balhimycin, also possesses vanHAXAb genes. The genes for the VanRS-like TCS VnlRSAb, together with the carboxypeptidase gene vanYAb, are part of the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster, which is located 2 Mb separate from the vanHAXAb. The deletion of vnlRSAb did not affect glycopeptide resistance or balhimycin production. In the A. balhimycina vnlRAb deletion mutant, the vanHAXAb genes were expressed at the same level as in the wild type, and peptidoglycan (PG) analyses proved the synthesis of resistant PG precursors. Whereas vanHAXAb expression in A. balhimycina does not depend on VnlRAb, a VnlRAb-depending regulation of vanYAb was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RNA-seq analyses. Although VnlRAb does not regulate the vanHAXAb genes in A. balhimycina, its heterologous expression in the glycopeptide-sensitive S. coelicolor ÎvanRSSc deletion mutant restored glycopeptide resistance. VnlRAb activates the vanHAXSc genes even in the absence of VanS. In addition, expression of vnlRAb increases actinorhodin production and influences morphological differentiation in S. coelicolor.",

In order to produce GT the host organism needs to have evolved a self-protection mechanism. GT contains a redox-cycling disulfide bridge that is important in mediating toxicity. Recently is has been demonstrated that <i>A. fumigatus</i> possesses a novel thiomethyltransferase protein called GtmA that has the ability to thiomethylate GT <i>in vivo</i>, which aids the organism in regulating GT biosynthesis. It has been suggested that thiomethylation of GT and similar sulfur-containing toxins may play a role in providing self-protection in host organisms. In this work we have engineered <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, a GT-naÃ¯ve organism, to express <i>A. fumigatus</i> GtmA. We demonstrate that GtmA can readily thiomethylate GT in yeast, which results in protection of the organism from exogenous GT. Our work has implications for understanding the evolution of GT self-protection mechanisms in organisms that are GT producers and non-producers.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Thiolactomycin (TLM) is a thiotetronate antibiotic that selectively targets bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis through inhibition of the Î²-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthases (KASI/II) that catalyse chain elongation on the type II (dissociated) fatty acid synthase. It has proved effective in <i>in vivo</i> infection models of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and continues to attract interest as a template for drug discovery. We have used a comparative genomics approach to uncover the (hitherto elusive) biosynthetic pathway to TLM and related thiotetronates. Analysis of the whole-genome sequence of <i>Streptomyces olivaceus</i> TÃ¼ 3010 producing the more ramified thiotetronate TÃ¼ 3010 provided initial evidence that such thiotetronates are assembled by a novel iterative polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase, and revealed the identity of other pathway enzymes, encoded by adjacent genes. Subsequent genome sequencing of three other thiotetronate-producing actinomycetes, including the <i>Lentzea</i> sp. ATCC 31319 that produces TLM, confirmed that near-identical clusters were also present in these genomes. In-frame gene deletion within the cluster for TÃ¼ 3010 from <i>Streptomyces thiolactonus</i> NRRL 15439, or within the TLM cluster, led to loss of production of the respective thiotetronate, confirming their identity. Each cluster houses at least one gene encoding a KASI/II enzyme, suggesting plausible mechanisms for self-resistance. A separate genetic locus encodes a cysteine desulfurase and a (thiouridylase-like) sulfur transferase to supply the sulfur atom for thiotetronate ring formation. Transfer of the main TÃ¼ 3010 gene cluster (<i>stu</i> gene cluster) into <i>Streptomyces avermitilis</i> led to heterologous production of this thiotetronate, showing that an equivalent sulfur donor can be supplied by this host strain. Mutational analysis of the TÃ¼ 3010 and TLM clusters has revealed the unexpected role of a cytochrome P450 enzyme in thiotetronate ring formation. These insights have allowed us to propose a mechanism for sulfur insertion, and have opened the way to engineering of the biosynthesis of TLM and other thiotetronates to produce novel analogues.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The nocardicins are a family of monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics produced by the actinomycete Nocardia uniformis subsp. tsuyamanensis ATCC 21806. The most potent of this series is nocardicin A, containing a syn-configured oxime moiety, an uncommon feature in natural products. The nocardicin A biosynthetic gene cluster was recently identified and found to encode proteins in keeping with nocardicin A production, including the nocardicin N-oxygenase, NocL, in addition to genes of undetermined function, such as nocK, which bears similarities to a broad family of esterases. The latter was hypothesized to be involved in the formation of the critical beta-lactam ring. While previously shown to effect oxidation of the 2'-amine of nocardicin C to provide nocardicin A, it was uncertain whether NocL was the only N-oxidizing enzyme required for nocardicin A biosynthesis. To further detail the role of NocL in nocardicin production in N. uniformis, and to examine the function of nocK, a method for the transformation of N. uniformis protoplasts to inactivate both nocK and nocL was developed and applied. A reliable protocol is reported to achieve both insertional disruption and in trans complementation in this strain. While the nocK mutant still produced nocardicin A at levels near that seen for wild-type N. uniformis, and therefore has no obvious role in nocardicin biosynthesis, the nocL disruptant failed to generate the oxime-containing metabolite. Nocardicin A production was restored in the nocL mutant upon in trans expression of the gene. Furthermore, the nocL mutant accumulated the biosynthetic intermediate nocardicin C, confirming its role as the sole oxime-forming enzyme required for production of nocardicin A.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Chalcomycin, a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic made by the bacterium Streptomyces bikiniensis, contains a 2,3-trans double bond and the neutral sugar D-chalcose in place of the amino sugar mycaminose found in most other 16-membered macrolides. Degenerate polyketide synthase (PKS)-specific primers were used to amplify DNA fragments from S. bikiniensis with very high identity to a unique ketosynthase domain of the tylosin PKS. The resulting amplimers were used to identify two overlapping cosmids encompassing the chm PKS. Sequencing revealed a contiguous segment of >60 kb carrying 25 putative genes for biosynthesis of the polyketide backbone, the two deoxysugars, and enzymes involved in modification of precursors of chalcomycin or resistance to it. The chm PKS lacks the ketoreductase and dehydratase domains in the seventh module expected to produce the 2,3-double bond in chalcomycin. Expression of PKS in the heterologous host Streptomyces fradiae, from which the tyl genes encoding the PKS had been removed, resulted in production of at least one novel compound, characterized as a 3-keto 16-membered macrolactone in equilibrium with its 3-trans enol tautomer and containing the sugar mycaminose at the C-5 position, in agreement with the structure predicted on the basis of the domain organization of the chm PKS. The production of a 3-keto macrolide from the chm PKS indicates that a discrete set of enzymes is responsible for the introduction of the 2,3-trans double bond in chalcomycin. From comparisons of the open reading frames to sequences in databases, a pathway for the synthesis of nucleoside diphosphate-D-chalcose was proposed.",

Here, we present the recent advances toward the engineering of novel microbial biosensors to detect the synthesis of secondary metabolites in bacteria and in the development of synthetic promoters and expression systems aiming at the construction of microbial cell factories for the production of these compounds. We place special focus on the potential of Gram-negative bacteria as a source of biosynthetic gene clusters and hosts for pathway assembly, on the construction and characterization of novel promoters for native hosts, and on the use of computer-aided design of novel pathways and expression systems for secondary metabolite production. Finally, we discuss some of the potentials and limitations of the approaches that are currently being developed and we highlight new directions that could be addressed in the field.",

        "pmc_abstract": "One of the most important features that enables <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> to grow within a susceptible individual and to cause disease is its ability to obtain Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions from the extremely zinc-limited environment provided by host tissues. Zinc uptake from this source in <i>A. fumigatus</i> relies on ZIP transporters encoded by the <i>zrfA</i>, <i>zrfB</i> and <i>zrfC</i> genes. The expression of these genes is tightly regulated by the ZafA transcription factor that regulates zinc homeostasis and is essential for <i>A. fumigatus</i> virulence. We combined the use of microarrays, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) analyses, DNase I footprinting assays and in silico tools to better understand the regulation of the homeostatic and adaptive response of <i>A. fumigatus</i> to zinc starvation. We found that under zinc-limiting conditions, ZafA functions mainly as a transcriptional activator through binding to a zinc response sequence located in the regulatory regions of its target genes, although it could also function as a repressor of a limited number of genes. In addition to genes involved in the homeostatic response to zinc deficiency, ZafA also influenced, either directly or indirectly, the expression of many other genes. It is remarkable that the expression of many genes involved in iron uptake and ergosterol biosynthesis is strongly reduced under zinc starvation, even though only the expression of some of these genes appeared to be influenced directly or indirectly by ZafA. In addition, it appears to exist in <i>A. fumigatus</i> a zinc/iron cross-homeostatic network to allow the adaptation of the fungus to grow in media containing unbalanced Zn:Fe ratios. The adaptive response to oxidative stress typically linked to zinc starvation was also mediated by ZafA, as was the strong induction of genes involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis and self-protection against endogenous gliotoxin. This study has expanded our knowledge about the regulatory and metabolic changes displayed by <i>A. fumigatus</i> in response to zinc starvation and has helped us to pinpoint new ZafA target genes that could be important for fungal pathogens to survive and grow within host tissues and, hence, for virulence.",

Structurally, muraymycins consist of a 5'-<i>C</i>-glycyluridine (GlyU) appended to a 5â³-amino-5â³-deoxyribose (ADR), forming a disaccharide core that is found in several peptidyl nucleoside inhibitors of MraY. For muraymycins, the GlyU-ADR disaccharide is further modified with an aminopropyl-linked peptide to generate the simplest structures, annotated as the muraymycin D series. Two enzymes encoded in the muraymycin biosynthetic gene cluster, Mur29 and Mur28, were functionally assigned <i>in vitro</i> as a MgÂ·ATP-dependent nucleotidyltransferase and a MgÂ·ATP-dependent phosphotransferase, respectively, both modifying the 3â³-OH of the disaccharide. Biochemical characterization revealed that both enzymes can utilize several nucleotide donors as cosubstrates and the acceptor substrate muraymycin also behaves as an inhibitor. Single-substrate kinetic analyses revealed that Mur28 preferentially phosphorylates a synthetic GlyU-ADR disaccharide, a hypothetical biosynthetic precursor of muraymycins, while Mur29 preferentially adenylates the D series of muraymycins. The adenylated or phosphorylated products have significantly reduced (170-fold and 51-fold, respectively) MraY inhibitory activities and reduced antibacterial activities, compared with the respective unmodified muraymycins. The results are consistent with Mur29-catalyzed adenylation and Mur28-catalyzed phosphorylation serving as complementary self-resistance mechanisms, with a distinct temporal order during muraymycin biosynthesis.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Regulatory genes play critical roles in natural product biosynthetic pathways. Chromomycins are promising anticancer natural products from actinomycetes. This study is aimed to create an efficient strain for production of these molecules by manipulating the regulatory genes.<h4>Results</h4>A putative but silent chromomycin biosynthetic gene cluster was discovered in <i>Streptomyces reseiscleroticus</i>. Heterologous expression of the ketosynthase, chain length factor, and acyl carrier protein in <i>Streptomyces lividans</i> confirmed that they are responsible for the assembly of a decaketide. Two regulatory genes are present in this gene cluster, including SARP-type activator SrcmRI and PadR-like repressor SrcmRII. Either overexpression of SrcmRI or disruption of SrcmRII turned on the biosynthetic pathway of chromomycins. The production titers of chromomycin A<sub>3</sub>/A<sub>2</sub> in R5 agar in these two strains reached 8.9âÂ±â1.2/13.2âÂ±â1.6 and 49.3âÂ±â4.3/53.3âÂ±â3.6Â mg/L, respectively. An engineered strain was then constructed with both SrcmRII disruption and SrcmRI overexpression, which produced chromomycins A<sub>3</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> in R5 agar at 69.4âÂ±â7.6 and 81.7âÂ±â7.2Â mg/L, respectively. Optimization of the culture conditions further increased the titers of chromomycins A<sub>3</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> respectively to 145.1âÂ±â15.3 and 158.3âÂ±â15.4Â mg/L in liquid fermentation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work revealed the synergistic effect of manipulation of pathway repressor and activator genes in the engineering of a natural product biosynthetic pathway. The resulting engineered strain showed the highest production titers of chromomycins by a strain of <i>Streptomyces</i>, providing an efficient way to produce these pharmaceutically valuable molecules.",

However, the increase in multidrug resistant bacteria is rapidly reducing the effectiveness of our current arsenal of ribosome-targeting antibiotics, highlighting the need for the discovery of compounds with new scaffolds that bind to novel sites on the ribosome. One possible avenue for the development of new antimicrobial agents is by characterization and optimization of ribosome-targeting peptide antibiotics. Biochemical and structural data on ribosome-targeting peptide antibiotics illustrates the large diversity of scaffolds, binding interactions with the ribosome as well as mechanism of action to inhibit translation. The availability of high-resolution structures of ribosomes in complex with peptide antibiotics opens the way to structure-based design of these compounds as novel antimicrobial agents.",

        "pmc_abstract": "There is astounding discrepancy between the genome-inscribed production capacity and the set of known secondary metabolite classes from many microorganisms as detected under laboratory cultivation conditions. Genome-mining techniques are meant to fill this gap, but in order to favor discovery of structurally novel as well as bioactive compounds it is crucial to amend genomics-based strategies with selective filtering principles. In this study, we followed a self-resistance guided approach aiming at the discovery of inhibitors of topoisomerase, known as valid target in both cancer and antibiotic therapy. A common host self-defense mechanism against such inhibitors in bacteria is mediated by so-called pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRP). Genes encoding the biosynthetic machinery for production of an alleged topoisomerase inhibitor were found on the basis of their collocation adjacent to a predicted PRP in the genome of the myxobacterium <i>Pyxidicoccus fallax</i> An d48, but to date no matching compound has been reported from this bacterium. Activation of this peculiar polyketide synthase type-II gene cluster in the native host as well as its heterologous expression led to the structure elucidation of new natural products that were named pyxidicyclines and provided an insight into their biosynthesis. Subsequent topoisomerase inhibition assays showed strong affinity to - and inhibition of - unwinding topoisomerases such as <i>E. coli</i> topoisomerase IV and human topoisomerase I by pyxidicyclines as well as precise selectivity, since <i>E. coli</i> topoisomerase II (gyrase) was not inhibited at concentrations up to 50 Î¼g ml<sup>-1</sup>.",

Particularly, bacterial secondary metabolites are in the spotlight due to advances in genome sequencing and mining, as well as for the potential of biosynthetic pathway manipulation to awake silent (cryptic) gene clusters under laboratory cultivation. Further progress in compound detection, such as the development of the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) molecular networking approach, has contributed to the discovery of novel bacterial natural products. The latter can be applied directly to bacterial crude extracts for identifying and dereplicating known compounds, therefore assisting the prioritization of extracts containing novel natural products, for example.

These genotoxic metabolites are produced by <i>pks</i>-encoded peptide-polyketide synthases as inactive prodrugs called precolibactins, which are then converted to colibactins by deacylation for DNA-damaging effects. Colibactins are bona fide virulence factors and are suspected of promoting colorectal carcinogenesis when produced by intestinal <i>E.Â coli</i> Natural active colibactins have not been isolated, and how they induce DNA damage in the eukaryotic host cell is poorly characterized. Here, we show that DNA strands are cross-linked covalently when exposed to enterobacteria producing colibactins. DNA cross-linking is abrogated in a <i>clbP</i> mutant unable to deacetylate precolibactins or by adding the colibactin self-resistance protein ClbS, confirming the involvement of the mature forms of colibactins. A similar DNA-damaging mechanism is observed <i>in cellulo</i>, where interstrand cross-links are detected in the genomic DNA of cultured human cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. The intoxicated cells exhibit replication stress, activation of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), and recruitment of the DNA cross-link repair Fanconi anemia protein D2 (FANCD2) protein. In contrast, inhibition of ATR or knockdown of FANCD2 reduces the survival of cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. These findings demonstrate that DNA interstrand cross-linking is the critical mechanism of colibactin-induced DNA damage in infected cells.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Colorectal cancer is the third-most-common cause of cancer death. In addition to known risk factors such as high-fat diets and alcohol consumption, genotoxic intestinal <i>Escherichia coli</i> bacteria producing colibactin are proposed to play a role in colon cancer development. Here, by using transient infections with genotoxic <i>E.Â coli</i>, we showed that colibactins directly generate DNA cross-links <i>in cellulo</i> Such lesions are converted into double-strand breaks during the repair response. DNA cross-links, akin to those induced by metabolites of alcohol and high-fat diets and by widely used anticancer drugs, are both severely mutagenic and profoundly cytotoxic lesions. This finding of a direct induction of DNA cross-links by a bacterium should facilitate delineating the role of <i>E.Â coli</i> in colon cancer and engineering new anticancer agents.",

        "pmc_abstract": "We have previously shown that the lactic acid bacterium <i>Lactobacillus brevis</i> 174A, isolated from <i>Citrus iyo</i> fruit, produces a bacteriocin designated brevicin 174A, which is comprised of two antibacterial polypeptides (designated brevicins 174A-Î² and 174A-Î³). We have also found a gene cluster, composed of eight open reading frames (ORFs), that contains genes for the biosynthesis of brevicin 174A, self-resistance to its own bacteriocin, and two transcriptional regulatory proteins. Some lactic acid bacterial strains have a system to start the production of bacteriocin at an adequate stage of growth. Generally, the system consists of a membrane-bound histidine protein kinase (HPK) that senses a specific environmental stimulus and a corresponding response regulator (RR) that mediates the cellular response. We have previously shown that although the HPK- and RR-encoding genes are not found on the brevicin 174A biosynthetic gene cluster in the 174A strain, two putative regulatory genes, designated <i>breD</i> and <i>breG</i>, are in the gene cluster. In the present study, we demonstrate that the expression of brevicin 174A production and self-resistance is positively controlled by two transcriptional regulatory proteins, designated BreD and BreG. BreD is expressed together with BreE as the self-resistance determinant of <i>L. brevis</i> 174A. DNase I footprinting analysis and a promoter assay demonstrated that BreD binds to the <i>breED</i> promoter as a positive autoregulator. The present study also demonstrates that BreG, carrying a transmembrane domain, binds to the common promoter of <i>breB</i> and <i>breC</i>, encoding brevicins 174A-Î² and 174A-Î³, respectively, for positive regulation.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The problem of the appearance of bacteria that are resistant to practical antibiotics and the increasing demand for safe foods have increased interest in replacing conventional antibiotics with bacteriocin produced by the lactic acid bacteria. This antibacterial substance can inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria without side effects on the human body. The bacteriocin that is produced by a <i>Citrus iyo</i>-derived <i>Lactobacillus brevis</i> strain inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria such as <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> In general, lactic acid bacterial strains have a system to start the production of bacteriocin at an adequate stage of growth, which is called a quorum-sensing system. The system consists of a membrane-bound histidine protein kinase that senses a specific environmental stimulus and a corresponding response regulator that mediates the cellular response.

In this work, we mined the genome of an Argentinean isolate of the recently described species P. donghuensis.

As this species has been recently described, and it seems like some plant-growth promoting (PGP) traits do not belong to the classical pseudomonads toolbox, we decide to explore the SVBP6 genome via an bioinformatic approach. Genome inspection confirmed our previous in vitro results about genes involved in several probiotic activities. Other genetic traits possibly involved in survival of SVBP6 in highly competitive environments, such as rhizospheres, were found. Tn5 mutagenesis revealed that the antifungal activity against the soil pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina was dependent on a functional gacS gene, from the regulatory cascade Gac-Rsm, but it was not due to volatile compounds. Altogether, our genomic analyses and in vitro tests allowed the phylogenetic assignment and provided the first insights into probiotic properties of the first P. donghuensis isolate from the Americas.",

Accordingly, it was meaningful to understand its genome features, expression differences between wild and AbrB-knockout (ÎAbrB) strains, and the regulation of bacitracin biosynthesis. Here, we sequenced, <i>de novo</i> assembled and annotated its genome, and also sequenced the transcriptomes in three growth phases. The genome of DW2 contained a DNA molecule of 4,468,952 bp with 45.93% GC content and 4,717 protein coding genes. The transcriptome reads were mapped to the assembled genome, and obtained 4,102â¼4,536 expressed genes from different samples. We investigated transcription changes in <i>B. licheniformis</i> DW2 and showed that ÎAbrB caused hundreds of genes up-regulation and down-regulation in different growth phases. We identified a complete bacitracin synthetase gene cluster, including the location and length of <i>bacABC, bcrABC</i>, and <i>bacT</i>, as well as their arrangement. The gene cluster <i>bcrABC</i> were significantly up-regulated in ÎAbrB strain, which supported the hypothesis in previous study of <i>bcrABC</i> transporting bacitracin out of the cell to avoid self-intoxication, and was consistent with the previous experimental result that ÎAbrB could yield more bacitracin. This study provided a high quality reference genome for <i>B. licheniformis</i> DW2, and the transcriptome data depicted global alterations across two strains and three phases offered an understanding of AbrB regulation and bacitracin biosynthesis through gene expression.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Soil bacteria naturally produce antibiotics as a competitive mechanism, with a concomitant evolution, and exchange by horizontal gene transfer, of a range of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Surveys of bacterial resistance elements in edaphic systems have originated primarily from human-impacted environments, with relatively little information from remote and pristine environments, where the resistome may comprise the ancestral gene diversity.<h4>Methods</h4>We used shotgun metagenomics to assess antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) distribution in 17 pristine and remote Antarctic surface soils within the undisturbed Mackay Glacier region. We also interrogated the phylogenetic placement of ARGs compared to environmental ARG sequences and tested for the presence of horizontal gene transfer elements flanking ARGs.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 177 naturally occurring ARGs were identified, most of which encoded single or multi-drug efflux pumps. Resistance mechanisms for the inactivation of aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol and Î²-lactam antibiotics were also common. Gram-negative bacteria harboured most ARGs (71%), with fewer genes from Gram-positive Actinobacteria and Bacilli (Firmicutes) (9%), reflecting the taxonomic composition of the soils. Strikingly, the abundance of ARGs per sample had a strong, negative correlation with species richness (râ=â-â0.49, Pâ<â0.05). This result, coupled with a lack of mobile genetic elements flanking ARGs, suggests that these genes are ancient acquisitions of horizontal transfer events.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ARGs in these remote and uncontaminated soils most likely represent functional efficient historical genes that have since been vertically inherited over generations. The historical ARGs in these pristine environments carry a strong phylogenetic signal and form a monophyletic group relative to ARGs from other similar environments.",

The mycelial lifestyle plays an important role in the productivity during industrial fermentations. The hyphae of liquid-grown streptomycetes can self-aggregate into pellets, which hampers their industrial exploitation. Here we show that the Mat complex, which is required for pellet formation, catalyzes the synthesis of extracellular poly-Î²-1,6-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) in the model organisms <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> and <i>Streptomyces lividans</i>. Extracellular accumulation of PNAG allows <i>Streptomyces</i> to attach to hydrophilic surfaces, while attachment to hydrophobic surfaces requires a cellulase-degradable extracellular polymer (EPS) produced by CslA. Over-expression of <i>matAB</i> was sufficient to restore pellet formation to <i>cslA</i> null mutants of <i>S. lividans</i>. The two EPS systems together increase the robustness of mycelial pellets. These new insights allow better control of liquid-culture morphology of streptomycetes, which may be harnessed to improve growth and industrial exploitation of these highly versatile natural product and enzyme producers.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Botryosphaeriaceae are an important fungal family that cause woody plant diseases worldwide. Recent studies have established a correlation between environmental factors and disease expression; however, less is known about factors that trigger these diseases. The current study reports on the 43.3âMb de novo genome of Lasiodiplodia theobromae and five other genomes of Botryosphaeriaceae pathogens. Botryosphaeriaceous genomes showed an expansion of gene families associated with cell wall degradation, nutrient uptake, secondary metabolism and membrane transport, which contribute to adaptations for wood degradation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes involved in carbohydrate catabolism, pectin, starch and sucrose metabolism, and pentose and glucuronate interconversion pathways were induced during infection. Furthermore, genes in carbohydrate-binding modules, lysine motif domain and the glycosyl hydrolase gene families were induced by high temperature. Among these genes, overexpression of two selected putative lignocellulase genes led to increased virulence in the transformants. These results demonstrate the importance of high temperatures in opportunistic infections. This study also presents a set of Botryosphaeriaceae-specific effectors responsible for the identification of virulence-related pathogen-associated molecular patterns and demonstrates their active participation in suppressing hypersensitive responses. Together, these findings significantly expand our understanding of the determinants of pathogenicity or virulence in Botryosphaeriaceae and provide new insights for developing management strategies against them.",

NAI-107 was also evaluated for its propensity to select or induce self-resistance in Gram-positive bacteria.<h4>Methods</h4>We used MIC determinations and chequerboard experiments to establish the antibacterial activity of the examined compounds against target microorganisms. Time-kill assays were used to evaluate killing of exponential and stationary-phase cells. The effects on biofilms (growth inhibition and biofilm eradication) were evaluated using biofilm-coated pegs. The frequency of spontaneous resistant mutants was evaluated by either direct plating or by continuous sub-culturing at 0.5âÃâMIC levels, followed by population analysis profiles.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that NAI-107 and its brominated variant are highly active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and some other fastidious Gram-negative pathogens. Furthermore, all compounds strongly synergized with polymyxin against Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and showed bactericidal activity. Surprisingly, NAI-107 alone was bactericidal against non-dividing A. baumannii cells. Against S. aureus, NAI-107 and related lantibiotics showed strong bactericidal activity against dividing and non-dividing cells. Activity was also observed against S. aureus biofilms. As expected for a lipid II binder, no significant resistance to NAI-107 was observed by direct plating or serial passages.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, the results of the current work, along with previously published results on the efficacy of NAI-107 in experimental models of infection, indicate that this lantibiotic represents a promising option in addressing the serious threat of antibiotic resistance.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Due to the important role of rifamycin in curing tuberculosis infection, the study on rifamycin has never been stopped. Although RifZ, which locates within the rifamycin biosynthetic cluster, has recently been characterized as a pathway-specific regulator for rifamycin biosynthesis, little is known about the regulation of rifamycin export.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, we proved that the expression of the rifamycin efflux pump (RifP) was regulated by RifQ, a TetR-family transcriptional regulator. Deletion of rifQ had little impact on bacterial growth, but resulted in improved rifamycin production, which was consistent with the reverse transcription PCR results that RifQ negatively regulated rifP's transcription. With electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I Footprinting assay, RifQ was found to directly bind to the promoter region of rifP, and a typical inverted repeat was identified within the RifQ-protected sequences. The transcription initiation site of rifP was further characterized and found to be upstream of the RifQ binding sites, well explaining the RifQ-mediated repression of rifP's transcription in vivo. Moreover, rifamycin B (the end product of rifamycin biosynthesis) remarkably decreased the DNA binding affinity of RifQ, which led to derepression of rifamycin export, reducing the intracellular concentration of rifamycin B as well as its toxicity against the host.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Here, we proved that the export of rifamycin B was repressed by RifQ in Amycolatopsis mediterranei, and the RifQ-mediated repression could be specifically relieved by rifamycin B, the end product of rifamycin biosynthesis, based on which a feedback model was proposed for regulation of rifamycin export. With the findings here, one could improve the antibiotic yield by simply inactivating the negative regulator of the antibiotic transporter.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Actinomycetes have been proven to be an excellent source of secondary metabolites for more than half a century. Exhibiting various bioactivities, they provide valuable approved drugs in clinical use. Most microorganisms are still untapped in terms of their capacity to produce secondary metabolites, since only a small fraction can be cultured in the laboratory. Thus, improving cultivation techniques to extend the range of secondary metabolite producers accessible under laboratory conditions is an important first step in prospecting underexplored sources for the isolation of novel antibiotics. Currently uncultured actinobacteria can be made available by bioprospecting extreme or simply habitats other than soil. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of genomes reveals most producers to harbour many more biosynthetic gene clusters than compounds identified from any single strain, which translates into a silent biosynthetic potential of the microbial world for the production of yet unknown natural products. This review covers discovery strategies and innovative methods recently employed to access the untapped reservoir of natural products. The focus is the order of actinomycetes although most approaches are similarly applicable to other microbes. Advanced cultivation methods, genomics- and metagenomics-based approaches, as well as modern metabolomics-inspired methods are highlighted to emphasise the interplay of different disciplines to improve access to novel natural products.",

We show here, using specific gene deletion and chemical complementation, that the gentamicin pathway up to the branch point is defined by the selectivity of the methyltransferases GenN, GenD1, and GenK. Unexpectedly, they comprise a methylation network in which early intermediates are ectopically modified. Using whole-genome sequence, we have also discovered the terminal 6'-<i>N</i>-methyltransfer required to produce gentamicin C2b from C1a or gentamicin C1 from C2, an example of an essential biosynthetic enzyme being located not in the biosynthetic gene cluster but far removed on the chromosome.

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Streptomyces</i> is a diverse group of gram-positive microorganisms characterised by a complex developmental cycle. <i>Streptomycetes</i> produce a number of antibiotics and other bioactive compounds used in the clinic. Most screening campaigns looking for new bioactive molecules from actinomycetes have been performed empirically, e.g., without considering whether the bacteria are growing under the best developmental conditions for secondary metabolite production. These screening campaigns were extremely productive and discovered a number of new bioactive compounds during the so-called \"golden age of antibiotics\" (until the 1980s). However, at present, there is a worrying bottleneck in drug discovery, and new experimental approaches are needed to improve the screening of natural actinomycetes. <i>Streptomycetes</i> are still the most important natural source of antibiotics and other bioactive compounds. They harbour many cryptic secondary metabolite pathways not expressed under classical laboratory cultures. Here, we review the new strategies that are being explored to overcome current challenges in drug discovery. In particular, we focus on those aimed at improving the differentiation of the antibiotic-producing mycelium stage in the laboratory.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Capuramycins are antimycobacterial antibiotics that consist of a modified nucleoside named uridine-5'-carboxamide (CarU). Previous biochemical studies have revealed that CarU is derived from UMP, which is first converted to uridine-5'-aldehyde in a reaction catalyzed by the dioxygenase CapA and subsequently to 5'-C-glycyluridine (GlyU), an unusual Î²-hydroxy-Î±-amino acid, in a reaction catalyzed by the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaldolase CapH. The remaining steps that are necessary to furnish CarU include decarboxylation, O atom insertion, and oxidation. We demonstrate that Cap15, which has sequence similarity to proteins annotated as bacterial, PLP-dependent l-seryl-tRNA(Sec) selenium transferases, is the sole catalyst responsible for complete conversion of GlyU to CarU. Using a complementary panel of in vitro assays, Cap15 is shown to be dependent upon substrates O<sub>2</sub> and (5'<i>S</i>,6'<i>R</i>)-GlyU, the latter of which was unexpected given that (5'<i>S</i>,6'<i>S</i>)-GlyU is the isomeric product of the transaldolase CapH. The two products of Cap15 are identified as the carboxamide-containing CarU and CO<sub>2</sub> While known enzymes that catalyze this type of chemistry, namely Î±-amino acid 2-monooxygenase, utilize flavin adenine dinucleotide as the redox cofactor, Cap15 remarkably requires only PLP. Furthermore, Cap15 does not produce hydrogen peroxide and is shown to directly incorporate a single O atom from O<sub>2</sub> into the product CarU and thus is an authentic PLP-dependent monooxygenase. In addition to these unusual discoveries, Cap15 activity is revealed to be dependent upon the inclusion of phosphate. The biochemical characteristics along with initiatory mechanistic studies of Cap15 are reported, which has allowed us to assign Cap15 as a PLP-dependent (5'<i>S</i>,6'<i>R</i>)-GlyU:O<sub>2</sub> monooxygenase-decarboxylase.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Secondary metabolites are synthesized by many microorganisms and provide a fitness benefit in the presence of competitors and predators. Secondary metabolism also can be costly, as it shunts energy and intermediates from primary metabolism. In <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp., secondary metabolism is controlled by the GacS-GacA global regulatory system. Intriguingly, spontaneous mutations in <i>gacS</i> or <i>gacA</i> (Gac<sup>-</sup> mutants) are commonly observed in laboratory cultures. Here we investigated the role of secondary metabolism in the accumulation of Gac<sup>-</sup> mutants in <i>PseudomonasÂ protegens</i> strain Pf-5. Our results showed that secondary metabolism, specifically biosynthesis of the antimicrobial compound pyoluteorin, contributes significantly to the accumulation of Gac<sup>-</sup> mutants. Pyoluteorin biosynthesis, which poses a metabolic burden on the producer cells, but not pyoluteorin itself, leads to the accumulation of the spontaneous mutants. Interspecific competition also influenced the accumulation of the Gac<sup>-</sup> mutants: a reduced proportion of Gac<sup>-</sup> mutants accumulated when <i>P.Â protegens</i> Pf-5 was cocultured with <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> than in pure cultures of strain Pf-5. Overall, our study associated a fitness trade-off with secondary metabolism, with metabolic costs versus competitive benefits of production influencing the evolution of <i>P.Â protegens</i>, assessed by the accumulation of Gac<sup>-</sup> mutants.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Many microorganisms produce antibiotics, which contribute to ecologic fitness in natural environments where microbes constantly compete for resources with other organisms. However, biosynthesis of antibiotics is costly due to the metabolic burdens of the antibiotic-producing microorganism. Our results provide an example of the fitness trade-off associated with antibiotic production. Under noncompetitive conditions, antibiotic biosynthesis led to accumulation of spontaneous mutants lacking a master regulator of antibiotic production. However, relatively few of these spontaneous mutants accumulated when a competitor was present. Results from this work provide information on the evolution of antibiotic biosynthesis and provide a framework for their discovery and regulation.",

SRS is located on the northeast bank of the Savannah River (South Carolina, USA), which is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) managed ecosystem left historically contaminated from decades of nuclear weapons production activities. Predominant contaminants within the impacted SRS environment include U and Nickel (Ni), both of which can be transformed microbially into less toxic forms via metal complexation mechanisms. Strain SRS-W-1-2016 was isolated from the uraniferous SRS soils on high concentrations of U (4200 Î¼M) and Ni (8500 Î¼M), but rapid growth was observed at much lower concentrations of 500 Î¼M U and 1000 Î¼M Ni, respectively. Microcosm studies established with strain SRS-W-1-2016 revealed a rapid decline in the concentration of spiked U such that it was almost undetectable in the supernatant by 72 h of incubation. Conversely, Ni concentrations remained unchanged, suggesting that the strain removed U but not Ni under the tested conditions. To obtain a deeper understanding of the metabolic potential, a draft genome sequence of strain SRS-W-1-2016 was obtained at a coverage of 90Ã, assembling into 93 contigs with an N50 contig length of 92,788 bases. The genomic size of strain SRS-W-1-2016 was found to be 4,564,701 bases with a total number of 4327 putative genes. An in-depth, genome-wide comparison between strain SRS-W-1-2016 and its four closest taxonomic relatives revealed 1159 distinct genes, representing 26.7% of its total genome; many associating with metal resistance proteins (e.g., for cadmium, cobalt, and zinc), transporter proteins, stress proteins, cytochromes, and drug resistance functions. Additionally, several gene homologues coding for resistance to metals were identified in the strain, such as outer membrane efflux pump proteins, peptide/nickel transport substrate and ATP-binding proteins, a high-affinity nickel-transport protein, and the <i>spoT</i> gene, which was recently implicated in bacterial resistance towards U. Detailed genome mining analysis of strain SRS-W-1-2016 also revealed the presence of a plethora of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters likely facilitating resistance to antibiotics, biocides, and metals. Additionally, several gene homologous for the well-known oxygenase enzyme system were also identified, potentially functioning to generate energy via the breakdown of organic compounds and thus enabling the successful colonization and natural attenuation of contaminants by <i>Arthrobacter</i> sp.

Because the toxoflavin had an antibacterial activity, a metagenomic E. coli clone capable of growing well in the presence of toxoflavin (30 Î¼g/ml) was isolated and the first metagenome-derived toxoflavin-degrading enzyme, TxeA of 140 amino acid residues, was identified from the positive E. coli clone. The conserved amino acids for metal-binding and extradiol dioxygenase activity, Glu-12, His-8 and Glu-130, were revealed by the sequence analysis of TxeA. The optimum conditions for toxoflavin degradation were evaluated with the TxeA purified in E. coli. Toxoflavin was totally degraded at an initial toxoflavin concentration of 100 Î¼g/ml and at pH 5.0 in the presence of Mn2+, dithiothreitol and oxygen. The final degradation products of toxoflavin and methyltoxoflavin were fully identified by MS and NMR as triazines. Therefore, we suggested that the new metagenomic enzyme, TxeA, provided the clue to applying the new metagenomic enzyme to resistance development of crop plants to toxoflavin-mediated disease as well as to biocatalysis for Baeyer-Villiger type oxidation.",

Results indicated that actinomycetes possess diverse self-resistance mechanisms, and that each of them responds differently to glycopeptide induction.

Important components of the resistome are intrinsic resistance genes of environmental bacteria, evolved and acquired over millennia, and their mobilization, which drives dissemination in pathogens. Understanding the dynamics and evolution of resistance across bacterial taxa is essential to address the current crisis in drug-resistant infections. Here we report the exploration of antibiotic resistance in the Paenibacillaceae prompted by our discovery of an ancient intrinsic resistome in Paenibacillus sp. LC231, recovered from the isolated Lechuguilla cave environment. Using biochemical and gene expression analysis, we have mined the resistome of the second member of the Paenibacillaceae family, Brevibacillus brevis VM4, which produces several antimicrobial secondary metabolites. Using phylogenomics, we show that Paenibacillaceae resistomes are in flux, evolve mostly independent of secondary metabolite biosynthetic diversity, and are characterized by cryptic, redundant, pseudoparalogous, and orthologous genes. We find that in contrast to pathogens, mobile genetic elements are not significantly responsible for resistome remodeling. This offers divergent modes of resistome development in pathogens and environmental bacteria.",

In spore-forming microorganisms, the germination process is controlled by intra- and inter-species communication. However, in the <i>Streptomyces</i> clade, which is capable of developing a plethora of valuable compounds, the chemical signals produced during germination have not been systematically studied before. Our previously published data revealed that several secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes are expressed during germination. Therefore, we focus here on the secondary metabolite production during this developmental stage. Using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we found that the sesquiterpenoid antibiotic albaflavenone, the polyketide germicidin A, and chalcone are produced during germination of the model streptomycete, <i>S. coelicolor</i>. Interestingly, the last two compounds revealed an inhibitory effect on the germination process.

        "pmc_abstract": "The cyclic lipodepsipeptides WAP-8294A are antibiotics with potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). One member of this family, WAP-8294A2 (Lotilibcin), was in clinical trials due to its high activity and distinct chemistry. However, WAP-8294A compounds are produced in a very low yield by Lysobacter and only under very stringent conditions. Improving WAP-8294A yield has become very critical for research and application of these anti-MRSA compounds. Here, we report a strategy to increase WAP-8294A production. We first used the CRISPR/dCas9 system to increase the expression of five cotranscribed genes (orf1-5) in the WAP gene cluster, by fusing the omega subunit of RNA polymerase with dCas9 that targets the operon's promoter region. This led to the transcription of the genes increased by 5-48 folds in strain dCas9-Ï3. We then refactored four putative self-protection genes (orf6, orf7, orf9 and orf10) by reorganizing them into an operon under the control of a strong Lysobacter promoter, P<sub>HSAF</sub>. The refactored operon was introduced into strain dCas9-Ï3, and the transcription of the self-protection genes increased by 20-60 folds in the resultant engineered strains. The yield of the three main WAP-8294A compounds, WAP-8294A1, WAP-8294A2, and WAP-8294A4, increased by 6, 4, and 9 folds, respectively, in the engineered strains. The data also showed that the yield increase of WAP-8294A compounds was mainly due to the increase of the extracellular distribution. WAP-8294A2 exhibited potent (MIC 0.2-0.8 Î¼g/mL) and specific activity against S.Â aureus among a battery of clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens (54 isolates).",

Co-crystallography and molecular dynamics simulation analyses reveal that these CCHs share a conserved aromatic cage for the hydrolytic activity. Subsequent cytotoxic assays confirm that CCHs are able to protect cells against YTM. Therefore, our findings suggest that the evolutionarily conserved GyrI-like proteins confer cellular protection against diverse xenobiotics via not only binding, but also catalysis.",

Bicyclomycin is a broad-spectrum DKP antibiotic with unique structure and function: it contains a highly oxidized bicyclic [4.2.2] ring and is the only known selective inhibitor of the bacterial transcription termination factor, Rho. Here, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster for bicyclomycin containing six iron-dependent oxidases. We demonstrate that the DKP core is made by a tRNA-dependent cyclodipeptide synthase, and hydroxylations on two unactivated sp<sup>3</sup> carbons are performed by two mononuclear iron, Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases. Using bioinformatics, we also identify a homologous gene cluster prevalent in a human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We detect bicyclomycin by overexpressing this gene clusterÂ and establish P. aeruginosa as a new producer of bicyclomycin. Our work uncovers the biosynthetic pathway for bicyclomycin and sheds light on the intriguing oxidation chemistry that converts a simple DKP into a powerful antibiotic.",

Surfactin treatment can inhibit cancer progression by growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and metastasis arrest. Owing to the potent effect of surfactin on cancer cells, numerous studies have recently investigated the mechanisms that underlie its anticancer activity. The amphiphilic nature of surfactin allows its easy incorporation nano-formulations, such as polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, microemulsions, liposomes, to name a few. The use of nano-formulations offers the advantage of optimizing surfactin delivery for an improved anticancer therapy.

Three transporter genes, sgvT1-T3 have been discovered within the 105Â kb GV/VG BGC, but the function of these efflux transporters have not been identified.<h4>Results</h4>In the present study, we have identified the different roles of these three transporters, SgvT1, SgvT2 and SgvT3. SgvT1 is a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter whereas SgvT2 appears to serve as the sole ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter within the GV/VG BGC. Both proteins are necessary for efficient GV/VG biosynthesis although SgvT1 plays an especially critical role by averting undesired intracellular GV/VG accumulation during biosynthesis. SgvT3 is an alternative MFS-based transporter that appears to serve as a compensatory transporter in GV/VG biosynthesis. We also have identified the Î³-butyrolactone (GBL) signaling pathway as a central regulator of sgvT1-T3 expression. Above all, overexpression of sgvT1 and sgvT2 enhances transmembrane transport leading to steady production of GV/VG in titers âÂ 3-fold greater than seen for the wild-type producer and without any notable disturbances to GV/VG biosynthetic gene expression or antibiotic control.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results shows that SgvT1-T2 are essential and useful in GV/VG biosynthesis and our effort highlight a new and effective strategy by which to better exploit streptogramin-based natural products of which GV and VG are prime examples with clinical potential.",

Bacterial AlkC and AlkD are specific for cationic alkylated nucleobases and have a distinctive HEAT-like repeat (HLR) fold. AlkD uses a unique non-base-flipping mechanism that enables excision of bulky lesions more commonly associated with nucleotide excision repair. In contrast, AlkC has a much narrower specificity for small lesions, principally N3-methyladenine (3mA). Here, we describe how AlkC selects for and excises 3mA using a non-base-flipping strategy distinct from that of AlkD. A crystal structure resembling a catalytic intermediate complex shows how AlkC uses unique HLR and immunoglobulin-like domains to induce a sharp kink in the DNA, exposing the damaged nucleobase to active site residues that projectÂ into the DNA This active site can accommodate and excise N3-methylcytosine (3mC) and N1-methyladenine (1mA), which are also repaired by AlkB-catalyzed oxidative demethylation, providing a potential alternative mechanism for repair of these lesions in bacteria.",

Promysalin is one such Pseudomonad secondary metabolite that exhibits narrow-spectrum antibacterial activity, originally isolated from the rhizosphere. We herein utilize affinity-based protein profiling (AfBPP) to identify succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh) as the biological target of the natural product. The target was further validated in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and through the selection, and sequencing, of a resistant mutant. Succinate dehydrogenase plays an essential role in primary metabolism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the only enzyme that is involved both in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and in respiration via the electron transport chain. These findings add credence to other studies that suggest that the TCA cycle is an understudied target in the development of novel therapeutics to combat P. aeruginosa, a significant pathogen in clinical settings.",

Nevertheless, despite long histories of antibiotic production and exposure, environmental bacteria are not resistant to all known antibiotics. This means that there are barriers to the acquisition of a complete resistance armamentarium. The sources, distribution, and movement of resistance mechanisms in different microbes and bacterial populations are mosaic features that act as barriers to slow this movement, thus moderating the emergence of bacterial pan-resistance. This is highly relevant to understanding the emergence of resistance in pathogenic bacteria that can inform better antibiotic management practices and influence new drug discovery.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Camptotheca acuminata is 1 of a limited number of species that produce camptothecin, a pentacyclic quinoline alkaloid with anti-cancer activity due to its ability to inhibit DNA topoisomerase. While transcriptome studies have been performed previously with various camptothecin-producing species, no genome sequence for a camptothecin-producing species is available to date. We generated a high-quality de novo genome assembly for C. acuminata representing 403 174 860 bp on 1394 scaffolds with an N50 scaffold size of 1752 kbp. Quality assessments of the assembly revealed robust representation of the genome sequence including genic regions. Using a novel genome annotation method, we annotated 31 825 genes encoding 40 332 gene models. Based on sequence identity and orthology with validated genes from Catharanthus roseus as well as Pfam searches, we identified candidate orthologs for genes potentially involved in camptothecin biosynthesis. Extensive gene duplication including tandem duplication was widespread in the C. acuminata genome, with 2571 genes belonging to 997 tandem duplicated gene clusters. To our knowledge, this is the first genome sequence for a camptothecin-producing species, and access to the C. acuminata genome will permit not only discovery of genes encoding the camptothecin biosynthetic pathway but also reagents that can be used for heterologous expression of camptothecin and camptothecin analogs with novel pharmaceutical applications.",

Recent advances in extraction and isolation techniques, and in state-of-the-art technologies involved in organic synthesis and chemical structure elucidation, have accelerated the numbers of antimicrobial molecules originating from the ocean moving into clinical trials. The chemical diversity associated with these marine-derived molecules is immense, varying from simple linear peptides and fatty acids to complex alkaloids, terpenes and polyketides, etc. Such an array of structurally distinct molecules performs functionally diverse biological activities against many pathogenic bacteria and fungi, making marine-derived natural products valuable commodities, particularly in the current age of antimicrobial resistance. In this review, we have highlighted several marine-derived natural products (and their synthetic derivatives), which have gained recognition as effective antimicrobial agents over the past five years (2012-2017). These natural products have been categorized based on their chemical structures and the structure-activity mediated relationships of some of these bioactive molecules have been discussed. Finally, we have provided an insight into how genome mining efforts are likely to expedite the discovery of novel antimicrobial compounds.",

The reason for the extreme toxicity of these lesions and the molecular basis for the way they are eliminated by BER have been unclear. Here, we describe the structural and biochemical properties of YTM adducts that are responsible for their toxicity, and define the mechanism by which they are excised by AlkD.

Currently, polymyxin B and E (colistin) are being used as the last-line therapy against life-threatening infections, unfortunately resistance to polymyxins in both the community and hospital setting is becoming more common. Octapeptins are structurally related non-ribosomal lipopeptide antibiotics that do not exhibit cross-resistance with polymyxins and have a broader spectrum of activity that includes Gram-positive bacteria. This makes them a precious and finite resource for the development of new antibiotics against these problematic polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This review surveys the progress in understanding octapeptin chemistry, mechanisms of antibacterial activity and biosynthesis. With the lack of cross-resistance and their broad antibacterial activity, the octapeptins represent ideal candidates for the development of a new generation of polymyxin-like lipopeptide antibiotics targeting polymyxin-resistant 'superbugs'.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The usefulness of genetic/metabolic engineering for further improvement of industrial strains is subject of discussion because of the general lack of knowledge on genetic alterations introduced by iterative cycles of random mutagenesis in such strains. An industrial clavulanic acid (CA)-overproducer <i>Streptomyces clavuligerus</i> DEPA was assessed to understand proteome-wide changes that have occurred in a local industrial CA overproducer developed through succesive mutagenesis programs. The proteins that could be identified corresponded to 33 distinct ORFs for underrepresented ones and 60 ORFs for overrepresented ones. Three CA biosynthetic enzymes were overrepresented in <i>S.Â clavuligerus</i> DEPA; carboxyethylarginine synthase (Ceas2), clavaldehyde dehydrogenase (Car) and carboxyethyl-arginine beta-lactam-synthase (Bls2) whereas the enzymes of two other secondary metabolites were underrepresented along with two important global regulators [two-component system (TCS) response regulator (SCLAV_2102) and TetR-family transcriptional regulator (SCLAV_3146)] that might be related with CA production and/or differentiation. Î³-butyrolactone biosynthetic protein AvaA2 was 2.6 fold underrepresented in <i>S.Â clavuligerus</i> DEPA. The levels of two glycolytic enzymes, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase and phosophoglycerate kinase were found decreased while those of dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) and isocitrate dehydrogenase, with two isoforms were found as significantly increased. A decrease of amino acid metabolism, methionine biosynthesis in particular, as well as S-adenosylmethionine synthetase appeared as one of the prominent mechanisms of success of <i>S.Â clavuligerus</i> DEPA strain as a prolific producer of CA. The levels of two enzymes of shikimate pathway that leads to the production of aromatic amino acids and aromatic secondary metabolites were also underrepresented. Some of the overrepresented stress proteins in <i>S.Â clavuligerus</i> DEPA included polynucleotide phosphorylase/polyadenylase (PNPase), ATP-dependent DNA helicase, two isoforms of an anti-sigma factor and thioredoxin reductase. Downregulation of important proteins of cell wall synthesis and division was recorded and a protein with Î²-lactamase domain (SCLAV_p1007) appeared in 12 isoforms, 5 of which were drastically overrepresented in DEPA strain. These results described herein provide useful information for rational engineering to improve CA production in <i>Streptomyces clavuligerus</i>.",

Biosynthesis is performed by polyketide synthases (PKSs), and the acyl carrier protein (ACP), a small acidic protein, that transports the growing polyketide chain and is essential for activity. Here we report the synthesis of two aromatic probes and a linear octaketide mimic that have been tethered to actinorhodin ACP. These experiments were aimed at probing the ACP's capacity to sequester a non-polar <i>versus</i> a phenolic aromatic ring (that more closely mimics a polyketide intermediate) as well as investigations with extended polyketide chain surrogates. The binding of these mimics has been assessed using high-resolution solution NMR studies and high-resolution structure determination. These results reveal that surprisingly a PKS ACP is able to bind and sequester a bulky non-polar substrate containing an aromatic ring in a fatty acid type binding mode, but the introduction of even a small degree of polarity favours a markedly different association at a surface site that is distinct from that employed by fatty acid ACPs.",

The development of a genetic system for the dynemicin producer Micromonospora chersina confirmed, for the first time, the requirement of the putative enediyne core biosynthetic genes (dynE8, U14 and U15) and a tailoring oxidase gene (orf23) for dynemicin production. Cloning and sequence analysis of a 76 kb of genomic sequence region containing dynE8 revealed a variety of genes conserved among known enediyne loci. Surprisingly, this fragment and flanking chromosomal DNA lacked any obvious genes encoding for the biosynthesis of the anthraquinone, suggesting that the location of genes encoding for the biosynthesis of the dynemicin enediyne core and the dynemicin anthraquinone are chromosomally distinct. The demonstrated trace production of a shunt product from mutant strain QGD23 (Deltaorf23) also sets the stage for subsequent studies to delineate the key steps in enediyne core biosynthesis and tailoring.",

The panels of 25â<i>M. tuberculosis</i> clinical strains were characterized for drug resistance-associated mutations with whole-genome sequencing and antibiotic profiles in the presence and absence of efflux inhibitor verapamil (VP).<h4>Results</h4>Different MICs were observed for the same target gene mutations. Out of the 16 MDR/pre-XDR/XDR isolates, 6 (37.5%) and 3 (18.8%) isolates demonstrated a significant decrease in rifampicin (RIF) MIC and isoniazid (INH) MIC due to the VP exposure (64âÎ¼g/mL), respectively. Susceptibility to RIF was fully restored in two isolates after VP exposure. Moreover, the efflux pump genes of <i>Rv2938, Rv2936, Rv1145, Rv1146, Rv933, Rv1250, Rv876</i>, <i>Rv2333, Rv2459, Rv849,</i> and <i>Rv1819</i> were overexpressed in the presence of anti-TB drugs, showing the contribution of these efflux pumps to the overall resistance phenotype.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results clearly showed that efflux systems, besides spontaneous mutations, play a role in the development of INH/RIF resistance. In addition, although VP was effective in reducing the expression of some efflux pumps, it was not very successful at the phenotypic level.",

The cpe gene is essential for clavulanic acid production, and the recent crystal structure of its product (Cpe) was shown to also contain an N-terminal isomerase/cyclase-like domain, but the function of the protein remains unknown. In the current study, we show that Cpe is a cytoplasmic protein and that both its N- and C-terminal domains are required for in vivo clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus. Our results along with those from previous studies allude towards a biosynthetic role for Cpe during the later stages of clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus. Amino acids from Cpe essential for biosynthesis were also identified, including one (Lys89) from the recently described N-terminal isomerase-like domain of unknown function. Homologues of Cpe from other clavulanic acid-producing Streptomyces spp. were shown to be functionally equivalent to the S. clavuligerus protein, whereas those from non-producers containing clavulanic acid-like gene clusters were not. The suggested in vivo involvement of an isomerase-like domain recruited by an ancestral Î²-lactamase related protein, supports a previous hypothesis that Cpe could be involved in a step requiring the opening and modification of the clavulanic acid core during its biosynthesis from 5S precursors.",

Bacillus paralicheniformis MDJK30 is a PGPR isolated from the peony rhizosphere and can suppress plant-pathogenic bacteria and fungi. To further uncover the genetic mechanism of the plant growth-promoting traits of MDJK30 and its closely related strains, we used comparative genomics to provide insights into the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationship between B. paralicheniformis and B. licheniformis.<h4>Results</h4>A comparative genomics analysis based on B. paralicheniformis MDJK30 and 55 other previously reported Bacillus strains was performed. The evolutionary position of MDJK30 and the evolutionary relationship between B. paralicheniformis and B. licheniformis were evaluated by studying the phylogeny of the core genomes, a population structure analysis and ANI results. Comparative genomic analysis revealed various features of B. paralicheniformis that contribute to its commensal lifestyle in the rhizosphere, including an opening pan genome, a diversity of transport and the metabolism of the carbohydrates and amino acids. There are notable differences in the numbers and locations of the insertion sequences, prophages, genomic islands and secondary metabolic synthase operons between B. paralicheniformis and B. licheniformis. In particular, we found most gene clusters of Fengycin, Bacitracin and Lantipeptide were only present in B. paralicheniformis and were obtained by horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and these clusters may be used as genetic markers for distinguishing B. paralicheniformis and B. licheniformis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study reveals that MDJK30 and the other strains of lineage paralicheniformis present plant growth-promoting traits at the genetic level and can be developed and commercially formulated in agriculture as PGPR. Core genome phylogenies and population structure analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for differentiating B. paralicheniformis and B. licheniformis. Comparative genomic analyses illustrate the genetic differences between the paralicheniformis-licheniformis group with respect to rhizosphere adaptation.",

This chapter describes the structure of the teneurin scaffold with reference to a large family of teneurin-like proteins that are widespread in modern prokaryotes. The central scaffold of modern eukaryotic teneurins is decorated by additional domains typically found in bacteria, which are re-purposed in eukaryotes to generate highly multifunctional receptors. We discuss how alternative splicing contributed to further diversifying teneurin structure and thereby function.

This review briefly summarizes the mechanism of surfactin biosynthesis, highlighting the synthesis pathway of N-terminally attached fatty acids, and outlines the main genetic engineering strategies for improving the yield and generating novel structures of surfactin, including promoter engineering, enhancing efflux systems, modifying the transcriptional regulatory genes of surfactin synthase (srfA), genomics and transcriptomics analysis, non ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domain and combinatorial biosynthesis.

        "pmc_abstract": "Massive apoptosis of lymphocytes is a hallmark of sepsis. The resulting immunosuppression is associated with secondary infections, which are often lethal. Moreover, sepsis-survivors are burdened with increased morbidity and mortality for several years after the sepsis episode. The duration and clinical consequences of sepsis induced-immunosuppression are currently unknown. We have used the mouse model of peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI) to investigate the quantitative and qualitative recovery of T lymphocytes for 3.5 months after sepsis with or without IL-7 treatment. Thymic output and the numbers of naive and effector/memory CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes quickly recovered after sepsis. IL-7 treatment resulted in an accelerated recovery of CD8+ lymphocytes. Next generation sequencing revealed no significant narrowing of the T cell receptor repertoire 3.5 months after sepsis. In contrast, detailed functional analyses of T helper (Th)-cell responses towards a fungal antigen revealed a significant loss of Th cells. Whereas cytokine production was not impaired at the single cell level, the absolute number of Th cells specific for the fungal antigen was reduced. Our data indicate a clinically relevant loss of pathogen-specific T cell clones after sepsis. Given the small number of naive T lymphocytes specific for a given antigen, this decrement of T cell clones remains undetected even by sensitive methods such as deep sequencing. Taken together, our data are compatible with long lasting impairments in CD4+ T-cell responses after sepsis despite rapid recovery of T lymphocyte populations.",

Moreover, the increasing emergence of drug resistance has led to a decrease in the efficacy of current antifungals. Thus, screening of new antifungal agents is imperative in the fight against antifungal drug resistance. In this study, we show that an endophytic bacterium, <i>Burkholderia gladioli</i> HDXY-02, isolated from the medicinal plant <i>Lycoris aurea</i>, showed broad-spectrum antifungal activity against plant and human fungal pathogens. An antifungal ability assay indicated that the bioactive component was produced from strain HDXY-02 having an extracellular secreted component with a molecular weight lower than 1,000 Da. In addition, we found that this new antifungal could be produced effectively by liquid fermentation of HDXY-02. Furthermore, the purified component contributing to the antifungal activity was identified to be toxoflavin, a yellow compound possessing a pyrimido[5,4-e][1,2,4]triazine ring. <i>In vitro</i> bioactivity studies demonstrated that purified toxoflavin from <i>B. gladioli</i> HDXY-02 cultures had a significant antifungal activity against the human fungal pathogen <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, resulting in abolished germination of conidia. More importantly, the growth inhibition by toxoflavin was observed in both wild-type and drug-resistant mutants (<i>cyp51A</i> and non-<i>cyp51A</i>) of <i>A. fumigatus</i> Finally, an optimized protocol for the large-scale production of toxoflavin (1,533âmg/liter) has been developed. Taken together, our findings provide a promising biosynthetic resource for producing a new antifungal reagent, toxoflavin, from isolates of the endophytic bacterium <i>B. gladioli</i><b>IMPORTANCE</b> Human fungal infections are a growing problem associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Moreover, a growing number of antifungal-resistant fungal isolates have been reported over the past decade. Thus, the need for novel antifungal agents is imperative. In this study, we show that an endophytic bacterium, <i>Burkholderia gladioli</i>, isolated from the medicinal plant <i>Lycoris aurea</i>, is able to abundantly secrete a compound, toxoflavin, which has a strong fungicidal activity not only against plant fungal pathogens but also against human fungal pathogens <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, and the model filamentous fungus <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> More importantly, toxoflavin also displays an efficacious inhibitory effect against azole antifungal-resistant mutants of <i>A. fumigatus</i> Consequently, our findings provide a promising approach to abundantly produce toxoflavin, which has novel broad-spectrum antifungal activity, especially against those currently problematic drug-resistant isolates.",

The draft genome sequence of this isolate strain revealed 18 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for secondary metabolites, which is an unusually low number compared to a typical streptomycete. Inactivation of a lantibiotic dehydrogenase-encoding gene from the BGC presumed to govern biosynthesis of a thiopeptide resulted in the loss of bioactivity. Using comparative HPLC analysis, two peaks in the chromatogram were identified in the extract from the wild-type strain, which were missing in the extract from the mutant. The compounds corresponding to the identified peaks were purified, and structure of one compound was elucidated using NMR. The compound, designated geninthiocin B, showed high similarity to several 35-membered macrocyclic thiopeptides geninthiocin, Val-geninthiocin and berninamycin A. Bioinformatics analysis of the geninthiocin B BGC revealed its close homology to that of berninamycins.",

The morphotypes also differ in aflatoxin production with S isolates consistently producing high concentrations of aflatoxin, whereas L isolates range from atoxigenic to highly toxigenic. The production of abundant sclerotia by the S morphotype suggests adaptation for long-term survival in the soil, whereas the production of abundant conidia by the L morphotype suggests adaptation for aerial dispersal to the phyllosphere. To identify genomic changes that support differential niche adaption, the sequences of three S and three L morphotype isolates were compared. Differences in genome structure and gene content were identified between the morphotypes. A >530 kb inversion between the morphotypes affect a secondary metabolite gene cluster and a cutinase gene. The morphotypes also differed in proteins predicted to be involved in carbon/nitrogen metabolism, iron acquisition, antimicrobial defense, and evasion of host immunity. The S morphotype genomes contained more intact secondary metabolite clusters indicating there is higher selection pressure to maintain secondary metabolism in the soil and that it is not limited to aflatoxin production. The L morphotype genomes were enriched in amino acid transporters, suggesting efficient nitrogen transport may be critical in the nutrient limited phyllosphere. These findings indicate the genomes of the two morphotypes differ beyond developmental genes and have diverged as they adapted to their respective niches.",

Modern 24/7 societies are challenging chronobiological homeostasis and public health. Exercise has been discussed as a potential zeitgeber for the human circadian system. Thus, if timed correctly, exercise may help in maintenance of chronobiological homeostasis and foster public health amidst increasingly challenging 24/7 lifestyles.<h4>Objective</h4>To test, using a systematic review of the literature, the following hypothesis: exercise is a zeitgeber for the human circadian system.<h4>Data sources</h4>The PubMed database was systematically searched on 19 October 2017 for relevant scientific studies and reports concerning chronobiology and exercise. Eligibility criteria were defined to include articles considering exercise as a potential zeitgeber for human circadian rhythmicity or chronobiological effects of exercise on health and/or physical performance. Cognitive effects and effects on children were excluded from the synthesis.<h4>Results</h4>Our systematic literature search and synthesis is compatible with the validity of the hypothesis. We report that potential exercise-zeitgeber properties may be used to improve health and performance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Informed timing of exercise, specific to the circadian rhythm phase and zeitgeber exposure of the individual, must be advocated in performance and disease contexts as an adjunct therapeutic or preventative strategy and physical enhancer.",

However, the roles of MDSCs in autoimmune arthritis are not completely understood. Indeed, their immunosuppressive functions in arthritic conditions remain controversial, with heterogeneity among MDSCs and differential effects among subpopulations receiving much attention. As a result, it is necessary to determine the roles of MDSC subpopulations in autoimmune arthritis to clarify their diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Interestingly, in the inflammation niche of autoimmune arthritis, each MDSC subpopulation can exhibit both alternatives of a given characteristic. Moreover, polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) are likely to be more suppressive and stable compared with monocytic MDSCs (MO-MDSCs). Although various important cytokines associated with the differentiation of MDSCs or MDSC subpopulations from immature myeloid precursors, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), have been largely applied in external inductive systems, their roles are not entirely clear. Moreover, MDSC-based clinical treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) continue to represent a significant challenge, as also reported for other autoimmune diseases. In this review, we describe the effects and actions of MDSC subpopulations on the development of autoimmune arthritis and analyze several types of MDSC-based therapeutic strategies to provide comprehensive information regarding immune networks and a foundation for more effective protocols for autoimmune arthritis.",

Several bioinformatics tools have been continuously developed to detect potential biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are responsible for the production of SM. Although the principles underlying the computation of these tools have been discussed, the biological background is left underrated and ambiguous. In this review, we emphasize the biological hypotheses in BGC formation driven from the observations across genomes in bacteria and fungi, and provide a comprehensive list of updated algorithms/tools exclusively for BGC detection. Our review points to a direction that the biological hypotheses should be systematically incorporated into the BGC prediction and assist the prioritization of candidate BGC.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Bacterial Panicle Blight caused by <i>Burkholderia glumae</i> is a major disease of rice, which has dramatically affected rice production around the world in the last years. In this study we describe the assessment of three <i>Streptomyces</i> isolates as biocontrol agents for <i>B. glumae</i>. Additionally, the presence of other plant-growth promoting abilities and their possible beneficial effects upon their inoculation on rice plants was evaluated as an ecological analysis for their future inoculation in rice crops. Two isolates (A20 and 5.1) inhibited growth of virulent <i>B. glumae</i> strains, as well as a wide range of bacterial and fungal species, while a third strain (7.1) showed only antifungal activity. <i>In vitro</i> tests demonstrated the ability of these strains to produce siderophores, Indoleacetic acid (IAA), extracellular enzymes and solubilizing phosphate. Greenhouse experiments with two rice cultivars indicated that <i>Streptomyces</i> A20 is able to colonize rice plants and promote plant growth in both cultivars. Furthermore, an <i>egfp</i> tagged mutant was generated and colonization experiments were performed, indicating that <i>Streptomyces</i> A20 -GFP was strongly associated with root hairs, which may be related to the plant growth promotion observed in the gnotobiotic experiments. In order to characterize the antimicrobial compounds produced by strain A20 bacteria, mass spectrometry analyses were performed. This technique indicated that A20 produced several antimicrobial compounds with sizes below 3 kDa and three of these molecules were identified as Streptotricins D, E and F. These findings indicate the potential of <i>Streptomyces</i> A20 as a biocontrol inoculant to protect rice plants against bacterial diseases.",

Here, we report a target-directed genome mining approach to elucidate the biosynthesis of the purine nucleoside antibiotic pair aristeromycin (ARM) and coformycin (COF) in <i>Micromonospora haikouensis</i> DSM 45626 (a new producer for ARM and COF) and <i>Streptomyces citricolor</i> NBRC 13005 (a new COF producer). We also provide biochemical data that MacI and MacT function as unusual phosphorylases, catalyzing an irreversible reaction for the tailoring assembly of neplanocin A (NEP-A) and ARM. Moreover, we demonstrate that MacQ is shown to be an adenosine-specific deaminase, likely relieving the potential \"excess adenosine\" for producing cells. Finally, we report that MacR, an annotated IMP dehydrogenase, is actually an NADPH-dependent GMP reductase, which potentially plays a salvage role for the efficient supply of the precursor pool. Hence, these findings illustrate a fine-tuned pathway for the biosynthesis of ARM and also open the way for the rational search for purine antibiotic pairs.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> ARM and COF are well known for their prominent biological activities and unusual chemical structures; however, the logic of their biosynthesis has long been poorly understood. Actually, the new insights into the ARM and COF pathway will not only enrich the biochemical repertoire for interesting enzymatic reactions but may also lay a solid foundation for the combinatorial biosynthesis of this group of antibiotics via a target-directed genome mining strategy.",

Here, we uncovered a distinctive self-defense strategy featured by a secreted oxidoreductase NapU to perform extracellularly oxidative activation and conditionally overoxidative inactivation of a matured prodrug in naphthyridinomycin (NDM) biosynthesis from <i>Streptomyces lusitanus</i> NRRL 8034. It was suggested that formation of NDM first involves a nonribosomal peptide synthetase assembly line to generate a prodrug. After exclusion and prodrug maturation, we identified a pharmacophore-inactivated intermediate, which required reactivation by NapU via oxidative C-H bond functionalization extracellularly to afford NDM. Beyond that, NapU could further oxidatively inactivate the NDM pharmacophore to avoid self-cytotoxicity if they coexist longer than necessary. This discovery represents an amalgamation of sophisticatedly temporal and spatial shielding mode conferring self-resistance in antibiotic biosynthesis from Gram-positive bacteria.",

The overuse and abuse of antibiotics coupled with the natural evolutionary processes of bacteria has led to this crisis. Only incremental advances in antibiotic development have occurred over the last 30 years. Novel classes of molecules, such as engineered antibodies, antibiotic enhancers, siderophore conjugates, engineered phages, photo-switchable antibiotics, and genome editing facilitated by the CRISPR/Cas system, are providing new avenues to facilitate the development of antimicrobial therapies. The informatics revolution is transforming research and development efforts to discover novel antibiotics. The explosion of nanotechnology and micro-engineering is driving the invention of antimicrobial materials, enabling the cultivation of \"uncultivable\" microbes and creating specific and rapid diagnostic technologies. Finally, a revival in the ecological aspects of microbial disease management, the growth of prebiotics, and integrated management based on the \"One Health\" model, provide additional avenues to manage this health crisis. These, and future scientific and technological developments, must be coupled and aligned with sound policy and public awareness to address the risks posed by rising antibiotic resistance.",

However, the detailed structure-binding mechanism of the interactions between CPTs and the insect Top1 protein remains unclear, which significantly hinders the development of novel CPTs as new insecticides. Herein, a series of 7-amide camptothecin analogs based on the binding mode of camptothecin in complex with Top1 (<i>Sf</i> Top1)-DNA from <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> cultured cell line Sf9 were designed and synthesized. Fifteen of these compounds exhibited excellent cytotoxic activity (values of IC<sub>50</sub> from 2.01 to 6.78 Î¼M) compared with camptothecin (29.47 Î¼M). The molecular simulations revealed the binding mechanism when the camptothecin parent rings were inserting parallel to DNA bases and stabling the ternary complex by Ï-Ï stacked and hydrogen-bond interactions, and further suggested that introduction of lipophilic and some electron-withdrawing groups on the amide linkage of camptothecin could be beneficial to its activity via some non-covalent interactions. Furthermore, almost all the synthesized compounds could inhibit the growth of <i>Spodoptera litura</i> larvae strongly (Inhibition rate from 50.20 to 79.05%), superior or comparable to camptothecin (55.69%) after 8 days of exposure. In particular, the compounds <b>4c</b>, <b>4d</b>, <b>4f</b>, and <b>4j</b>, which presented more than 70% inhibitory activities, were deserved to be developed as potential biorational pesticides.

Expression of stpks1 in Aspergillus oryzae leads to the production of prestrobilurin A when the fermentation is supplemented with a benzoyl coenzyme A (CoA) analogue. This enables the discovery of a previously unobserved route to benzoyl CoA. Reconstruction of the gene cluster in A. oryzae leads to the formation of prestrobilurin A, and addition of the gene str9 encoding an FAD-dependent oxygenase leads to the key oxidative rearrangement responsible for the creation of the Î²-methoxyacrylate toxophore.

        "pmc_abstract": "Plant cell walls are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, collectively known as lignocellulose. Microorganisms degrade lignocellulose to liberate sugars to meet metabolic demands. Using a metagenomic sequencing approach, we previously demonstrated that the microbiome of the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) is replete with genes that could encode lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. Here, we report the identification, synthesis and partial characterization of four novel genes from the porcupine microbiome encoding putative lignocellulose-degrading enzymes: Î²-glucosidase, Î±-L-arabinofuranosidase, Î²-xylosidase, and endo-1,4-Î²-xylanase. These genes were identified via conserved catalytic domains associated with cellulose- and hemicellulose-degradation. Phylogenetic trees were created for each of these putative enzymes to depict genetic relatedness to known enzymes. Candidate genes were synthesized and cloned into plasmid expression vectors for inducible protein expression and secretion. The putative Î²-glucosidase fusion protein was efficiently secreted but did not permit Escherichia coli (E. coli) to use cellobiose as a sole carbon source, nor did the affinity purified enzyme cleave p-Nitrophenyl Î²-D-glucopyranoside (p-NPG) substrate in vitro over a range of physiological pH levels (pH 5-7). The putative hemicellulose-degrading Î²-xylosidase and Î±-L-arabinofuranosidase enzymes also lacked in vitro enzyme activity, but the affinity purified endo-1,4-Î²-xylanase protein cleaved a 6-chloro-4-methylumbelliferyl xylobioside substrate in acidic and neutral conditions, with maximal activity at pH 7. At this optimal pH, KM, Vmax, and kcat were determined to be 32.005 Â± 4.72 Î¼M, 1.16x10-5 Â± 3.55x10-7 M/s, and 94.72 s-1, respectively. Thus, our pipeline enabled successful identification and characterization of a novel hemicellulose-degrading enzyme from the porcupine microbiome. Progress towards the goal of introducing a complete lignocellulose-degradation pathway into E. coli will be accelerated by combining synthetic metagenomic approaches with functional metagenomic library screening, which can identify novel enzymes unrelated to those found in available databases.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Enfumafungin is a glycosylated fernene-type triterpenoid produced by the fungus Hormonema carpetanum. Its potent antifungal activity, mediated by its interaction with Î²-1,3-glucan synthase and the fungal cell wall, has led to its development into the semi-synthetic clinical candidate, ibrexafungerp (=SCY-078). We report on the preliminary identification of the enfumafungin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) based on genome sequencing, phylogenetic reconstruction, gene disruption, and cDNA sequencing studies. Enfumafungin synthase (efuA) consists of a terpene cyclase domain (TC) fused to a glycosyltransferase (GT) domain and thus represents a novel multifunctional enzyme. Moreover, the TC domain bears a phylogenetic relationship to bacterial squalene-hopene cyclases (SHC) and includes a typical DXDD motif within the active centre suggesting that efuA evolved from SHCs. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the GT domain indicated that this portion of the fusion gene originated from fungal sterol GTs. Eleven genes flanking efuA are putatively involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, transport and self-resistance of enfumafungin and include an acetyltransferase, three P450 monooxygenases, a dehydrogenase, a desaturase and a reductase. A hypothetical scheme for enfumafungin assembly is proposed in which the E-ring is oxidatively cleaved to yield the four-ring system of enfumafungin. EfuA represents the first member of a widespread lineage of fungal SHCs.",

In the present study, we analysed Streptomyces coelicolor growth and differentiation in the presence of the hypo-methylating agent 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) in order to investigate whether cytosine methylation has a role in differentiation. We found that cytosine demethylation caused a delay in spore germination, aerial mycelium development, sporulation, as well as a massive impairment of actinorhodin production. Thus, we searched for putative DNA methyltransferase genes in the genome and constructed a mutant of the SCO1731 gene. The analysis of the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strain demonstrated that inactivation of SCO1731 leads to a strong decrease of cytosine methylation and almost to the same phenotype obtained after 5-aza-dC treatment. Altogether, our data demonstrate that cytosine methylation influences morphological differentiation and actinorhodin production in S. coelicolor and expand our knowledge on this model bacterial system.",

However, the molecular logic underlying the biosynthesis of this antibiotic has remained poorly understood.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we report the discovery and characterization of the TBN biosynthetic pathway from Streptomyces tubercidicus NBRC 13090 via reconstitution of its production in a heterologous host. We demonstrated that TubE specifically utilizes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate and 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine for the precise construction of the deazapurine nucleoside scaffold. Moreover, we provided biochemical evidence that TubD functions as an NADPH-dependent reductase, catalyzing irreversible reductive deamination. Finally, we verified that TubG acts as a Nudix hydrolase, preferring Co<sup>2+</sup> for the maintenance of maximal activity, and is responsible for the tailoring hydrolysis step leading to TBN.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings lay a foundation for the rational generation of TBN analogs through synthetic biology strategy, and also open the way for the target-directed search of TBN-related antibiotics.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria poses a serious public health challenge worldwide. However, antibiotic resistance genes are not confined to the clinic; instead they are widely prevalent in different bacterial populations in the environment. Therefore, to understand development of antibiotic resistance in pathogens, we need to consider important reservoirs of resistance genes, which may include determinants that confer self-resistance in antibiotic producing soil bacteria and genes encoding intrinsic resistance mechanisms present in all or most non-producer environmental bacteria. While the presence of resistance determinants in soil and environmental bacteria does not pose a threat to human health, their mobilization to new hosts and their expression under different contexts, for example their transfer to plasmids and integrons in pathogenic bacteria, can translate into a problem of huge proportions, as discussed in this review. Selective pressure brought about by human activities further results in enrichment of such determinants in bacterial populations. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand distribution of resistance determinants in bacterial populations, elucidate resistance mechanisms, and determine environmental factors that promote their dissemination. This comprehensive review describes the major known self-resistance mechanisms found in producer soil bacteria of the genus <i>Streptomyces</i> and explores the relationships between resistance determinants found in producer soil bacteria, non-producer environmental bacteria, and clinical isolates. Specific examples highlighting potential pathways by which pathogenic clinical isolates might acquire these resistance determinants from soil and environmental bacteria are also discussed. Overall, this article provides a conceptual framework for understanding the complexity of the problem of emergence of antibiotic resistance in the clinic. Availability of such knowledge will allow researchers to build models for dissemination of resistance genes and for developing interventions to prevent recruitment of additional or novel genes into pathogens.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Actinobacteria are prolific producers of antitumor antibiotics with antiproliferative activity, but why these bacteria synthetize metabolites with this bioactivity has so far remained a mystery. In this work we raised the hypothesis that under certain circumstances, production of antiproliferative agents could be part of a genetically programmed death of the producing organism. While programmed cell death (PCD) has been well documented when <i>Streptomyces</i> species switch from vegetative (nutrition) to aerial (reproduction) growth, lethal determinants are yet to be discovered. Using DNA-damaging prodiginines of <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> as model system, we revealed that, under certain conditions, their biosynthesis is always triggered in the dying zone of the mycelial network prior to morphological differentiation, right after an initial round of cell death. The programmed massive death round of the vegetative mycelium is absent in a prodiginine non-producer (Î<i>redD</i> strain), and mutant complementation restored both prodiginine production and cell death. The <i>redD</i> null mutant of <i>S. coelicolor</i> also showed increased DNA, RNA, and proteins synthesis when most of the mycelium of the wild-type strain was dead when prodiginines accumulated. Moreover, addition of the prodiginine synthesis inhibitors also resulted in enhanced accumulation of viable filaments. Overall, our data enable us to propose a model where the time-space production of prodiginines is programmed to be triggered by the perception of dead cells, and their biosynthesis further amplifies the PCD process. As prodiginine production coincides with the moment <i>S. coelicolor</i> undergoes morphogenesis, the production of these lethal compounds might be used to eradicate the obsolete part of the population in order to provide nutrients for development of the survivors. Hence, next to weapons in competition between organisms or signals in inter- and intra-species communications, we propose a third role for antibiotics (in the literal meaning of the word 'against life') i.e., elements involved in self-toxicity in order to control cell proliferation, and/or for PCD associated with developmental processes.",

Transcriptional analysis revealed that all of these genes are likely to be transcribed as a single operon from two promoters, <i>tun</i>p1 and <i>tun</i>p2. In-frame deletion analysis revealed that just six of these genes (<i>tunABCDEH</i>) are essential for tunicamycin production in the heterologous host <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i>, while five (<i>tunFGKLN</i>) with likely counterparts in primary metabolism are not necessary, but presumably ensure efficient production of the antibiotic at the onset of tunicamycin biosynthesis. Three genes are implicated in immunity, namely, <i>tunI</i> and <i>tunJ</i>, which encode a two-component ABC transporter presumably required for export of the antibiotic, and <i>tunM</i>, which encodes a putative <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase.

In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, several gene products have been proposed to be involved in cross-link repair based on the hypersensitivity of mutants to cross-linking agents. However, cross-linking agents induce several forms of DNA damage, making it challenging to attribute mutant hypersensitivity specifically to interstrand cross-links. To address this, we compared the survival of UVA-irradiated repair mutants in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralen-which forms interstrand cross-links and monoadducts-to that of angelicin-a congener forming only monoadducts. We show that incision by nucleotide excision repair is not required for resistance to interstrand cross-links. In addition, neither RecN nor DNA polymerases II, IV, or V is required for interstrand cross-link survival, arguing against models that involve critical roles for double-strand break repair or translesion synthesis in the repair process. Finally, estimates based on Southern analysis of DNA fragments in alkali agarose gels indicate that lethality occurs in wild-type cells at doses producing as few as one to two interstrand cross-links per genome. These observations suggest that <i>E. coli</i> may lack an efficient repair mechanism for this form of damage.",

However, compared to traditional bioactivity-guided approaches, genome mining of natural products with specific and potent biological activities remains challenging<sup>4</sup>. Here we present the discovery and validation of a potent herbicide that targets a critical metabolic enzyme that is required for plant survival. Our approach is based on the co-clustering of a self-resistance gene in the natural-product biosynthesis gene cluster<sup>7-9</sup>, which provides insight into the potential biological activity of the encoded compound. We targeted dihydroxy-acid dehydratase in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway in plants; the last step in this pathway is often targeted for herbicide development<sup>10</sup>. We show that the fungal sesquiterpenoid aspterric acid, which was discovered using the method described above, is a sub-micromolar inhibitor of dihydroxy-acid dehydratase that is effective as a herbicide in spray applications. The self-resistance gene astD was validated to be insensitive to aspterric acid and was deployed as a transgene in the establishment of plants that are resistant to aspterric acid. This herbicide-resistance gene combination complements the urgent ongoing efforts to overcome weed resistance<sup>11</sup>.

        "pmc_abstract": "Durable crop protection is an essential component of current and future food security. However, the effectiveness of pesticides is threatened by the evolution of resistant pathogens, weeds and insect pests. Pesticides are mostly novel synthetic compounds, and yet target species are often able to evolve resistance soon after a new compound is introduced. Therefore, pesticide resistance provides an interesting case of rapid evolution under strong selective pressures, which can be used to address fundamental questions concerning the evolutionary origins of adaptations to novel conditions. We ask: (i) whether this adaptive potential originates mainly from de novo mutations or from standing variation; (ii) which pre-existing traits could form the basis of resistance adaptations; and (iii) whether recurrence of resistance mechanisms among species results from interbreeding and horizontal gene transfer or from independent parallel evolution. We compare and contrast the three major pesticide groups: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Whilst resistance to these three agrochemical classes is to some extent united by the common evolutionary forces at play, there are also important differences. Fungicide resistance appears to evolve, in most cases, by de novo point mutations in the target-site encoding genes; herbicide resistance often evolves through selection of polygenic metabolic resistance from standing variation; and insecticide resistance evolves through a combination of standing variation and de novo mutations in the target site or major metabolic resistance genes. This has practical implications for resistance risk assessment and management, and lessons learnt from pesticide resistance should be applied in the deployment of novel, non-chemical pest-control methods.",

This review compares the molecular mechanisms of the resistance against phycotoxins, toxins from marine and terrestrial animals, plants and fungi, and antibiotics. The results reveal that each kingdom possesses the characteristic features. The main mechanisms in each kingdom are transporters/efflux pumps in phycotoxins, mutation and modification of targets and sequestration in marine and terrestrial animal toxins, ABC transporters and sequestration in plant toxins, transporters in fungal toxins, and various or mixed mechanisms in antibiotics. Antibiotic producers in particular make tremendous efforts for avoiding suicide, and are more flexible and adaptable to the changes of environments. With these features in mind, potential alternative strategies to overcome these resistance problems are discussed. This paper will provide clues for solving the issues of drug resistance.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Microbial natural products are a tremendous source of new bioactive chemical entities for drug discovery. Next generation sequencing has revealed an unprecedented genomic potential for production of secondary metabolites by diverse micro-organisms found in the environment and in the microbiota. Genome mining has further led to the discovery of numerous uncharacterized 'cryptic' metabolic pathways in the classical producers of natural products such as Actinobacteria and fungi. These biosynthetic gene clusters may code for improved biologically active metabolites, but harnessing the full genetic potential has been hindered by the observation that many of the pathways are 'silent' under laboratory conditions. Here we provide an overview of the various biotechnological methodologies, which can be divided to pleiotropic, biosynthetic gene cluster specific, and targeted genome-wide approaches that have been developed for the awakening of microbial secondary metabolic pathways.",

Here, we functionally assign and characterize six enzymes from the muraymycin biosynthetic pathway involved in the core assembly that starts from uridine monophosphate (UMP). The biosynthesis is initiated by Mur16, a nonheme Fe(II)- and Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, followed by four transferase enzymes: Mur17, a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaldolase; Mur20, an aminotransferase; Mur26, a pyrimidine phosphorylase; and Mur18, a nucleotidylyltransferase. The pathway culminates in glycosidic bond formation in a reaction catalyzed by an additional transferase enzyme, Mur19, a ribosyltransferase. Analysis of the biochemical properties revealed several noteworthy discoveries including that (i) Mur16 and downstream enzymes can also process 2'-deoxy-UMP to generate a 2-deoxy-ADR, which is consistent with the structure of some muraymycin congeners; (ii) Mur20 prefers l-Tyr as the amino donor source; (iii) Mur18 activity absolutely depends on the amine functionality of the ADR precursor consistent with the nucleotidyltransfer reaction occurring after the Mur20-catalyzed aminotransfer reaction; and (iv) the bona fide sugar acceptor for Mur19 is (5' S,6' S)-GlyU, suggesting that ribosyltransfer occurs prior to N-alkylation of GlyU. Finally, a one-pot, six-enzyme reaction was utilized to generate the ADR-GlyU disaccharide core starting from UMP.",

Reinvestigation of two mutant strains using new media conditions led to the isolation of three new muraymycin congeners, named B8, B9, and C6 (1-3), as well as a known muraymycin, C1. Structures of the compounds were elucidated by HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses. Complete 2D NMR assignments for the known muraymycin C1 are also provided for the first time. Compounds 1 and 2, which differ from other muraymycins by having an elongated, terminally branched fatty acid side chain, had picomolar IC<sub>50</sub> values against Staphylococcus aureus and Aquifex aeolicus MraY and showed good antibacterial activity against S. aureus (MIC = 2 and 6 Î¼g/mL, respectively) and Escherichia coli Î tolC (MIC = 4 and 2 Î¼g/mL, respectively). Compound 3, which is characterized by an N-acetyl modification of the primary amine of the dissacharide core that is shared among nearly all of the reported muraymycin congeners, greatly reduced its inhibitory and antibacterial activity compared to nonacylated muraymycin C1, which possibly indicates this modification is used for self-resistance.",

Precolibactins are converted to colibactins by N-deacylation; the latter are postulated to be genotoxic and to contribute to colorectal cancer formation. Though advances toward elucidating (pre)colibactin biosynthesis have been made, the functions and mechanisms of several clb gene products remain poorly understood. Here we report the 2.1 Ã X-ray structure and molecular function of ClbS, a gene product that confers resistance to colibactin toxicity in host bacteria and which has been shown to be important for bacterial viability. The structure harbors a potential colibactin binding site and shares similarity to known hydrolases. In vitro studies using a synthetic colibactin analog and ClbS or an active site residue mutant reveal cyclopropane hydrolase activity that converts the electrophilic cyclopropane of the colibactins into an innocuous hydrolysis product. As the cyclopropane has been shown to be essential for genotoxic effects in vitro, this ClbS-catalyzed ring-opening provides a means for the bacteria to circumvent self-induced genotoxicity. Our study provides a molecular-level view of the first reported cyclopropane hydrolase and support for a specific mechanistic role of this enzyme in colibactin resistance.",

There is an urgent need to access macrolides and unnatural macrolide derivatives for drug discovery, drug manufacture, and probe development. Typically, efforts to engineer the biosynthesis of macrolides and macrolide analogues in various microbial hosts are hampered by the complexity of macrolide biosynthetic pathways and our limited ability to rationally reprogram type I PKSs and post-PKS machinery. High-throughput approaches based on synthetic biology and directed evolution could overcome this problem by testing the function of large libraries of variants. Yet, methods that can identify mutant enzymes, pathways, and strains that produce the desired macrolide target are not generally available. Here we show that the promiscuous macrolide sensing transcription factor MphR is a powerful platform for engineering variants with tailored properties. We identified variants that displayed improved sensitivity toward erythromycin, tailored the inducer specificity, and significantly improved sensitivity to macrolides that were very poor inducers of the wild-type MphR biosensor. Designer macrolide biosensors should find broad utility and enable applications related to high-throughput synthetic biology and directed evolution of macrolide biosynthesis.",

Among bacterial resistance, Î²-lactam antibiotic resistance is the most prevailing and threatening area. Antibiotic resistance is thought to originate in antibiotic-producing bacteria such as Streptomyces. In this review, Î²-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in Streptomyces are explored mainly by phylogenetic analyses from the viewpoint of self-resistance. Although PBPs are more important than Î²-lactamases in self-resistance, phylogenetically diverse Î²-lactamases exist in Streptomyces. While class A Î²-lactamases are mostly detected in their enzyme activity, over two to five times more classes B and C Î²-lactamase genes are identified at the whole genomic level. These genes can subsequently be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. As for PBPs, two pairs of low affinity PBPs protect Streptomyces from the attack of self-producing and other environmental Î²-lactam antibiotics. PBPs with PASTA domains are detectable only in class A PBPs in Actinobacteria with the exception of Streptomyces. None of the Streptomyces has PBPs with PASTA domains. However, one of class B PBPs without PASTA domain and a serine/threonine protein kinase with four PASTA domains are located in adjacent positions in most Streptomyces. These class B type PBPs are involved in the spore wall synthesizing complex and probably in self-resistance. Lastly, this paper emphasizes that the resistance mechanisms in Streptomyces are very hard to deal with, despite great efforts in finding new antibiotics.",

It derives from cyclo-(L-isoleucyl-L-leucyl) and has an unusual and highly oxidized bicyclic structure that is formed by an ether bridge between the hydroxylated terminal carbon atom of the isoleucine lateral chain and the alpha carbon of the leucine in the diketopiperazine ring. Here, we paired in vivo and in vitro studies to complete the characterization of the bicyclomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. The construction of in-frame deletion mutants in the biosynthetic gene cluster allowed for the accumulation and identification of biosynthetic intermediates.

In this review, we provide an overview of previous studies that investigated PKS evolution and propose a model that challenges the currently prevailing view that gene duplication has played a major role in the emergence of multimodularity. We also analyze the ensemble of orphan PKS clusters sequenced so far to evaluate how large the entire diversity of assembly-line PKS clusters and their chemical products could be.

        "pmc_abstract": "Fungal sulfur uptake is required for incorporation into the sidechains of the amino acids cysteine and methionine, and is also essential for the biosynthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the key source of methyl groups in cellular transmethylation reactions, and <i>S</i>-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Biosynthesis of redox-active gliotoxin in the opportunistic fungal pathogen <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> has been elucidated over the past 10 years. Some fungi which produce gliotoxin-like molecular species have undergone unexpected molecular rewiring to accommodate this high-risk biosynthetic process. Specific disruption of gliotoxin biosynthesis, via deletion of <i>gliK</i>, which encodes a Î³-glutamyl cyclotransferase, leads to elevated intracellular antioxidant, ergothioneine (EGT), levels, and confirms crosstalk between the biosynthesis of both sulfur-containing moieties. Gliotoxin is ultimately formed by gliotoxin oxidoreductase GliT-mediated oxidation of dithiol gliotoxin (DTG). In fact, DTG is a substrate for both GliT and a <i>bis</i>-thiomethyltransferase, GtmA. GtmA converts DTG to bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin (BmGT), using 2 mol SAM and resultant SAH must be re-converted to SAM via the action of the Methyl/Met cycle. In the absence of GliT, DTG fluxes via GtmA to BmGT, which results in both SAM depletion and SAH overproduction. Thus, the negative regulation of gliotoxin biosynthesis via GtmA must be counter-balanced by GliT activity to avoid Methyl/Met cycle dysregulation, SAM depletion and <i>trans</i> consequences on global cellular biochemistry in <i>A. fumigatus</i>. DTG also possesses potent Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation properties which positions this sulfur-containing metabolite as a putative component of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis system within fungi. EGT plays an essential role in high-level redox homeostasis and its presence requires significant consideration in future oxidative stress studies in pathogenic filamentous fungi. In certain filamentous fungi, sulfur is additionally indirectly required for the formation of EGT and the disulfide-bridge containing non-ribosomal peptide, gliotoxin, and related epipolythiodioxopiperazines. Ultimately, interference with emerging sulfur metabolite functionality may represent a new strategy for antifungal drug development.",

A total of 3320 unique peptide fragments were identified after inoculation with either A. phaeospermum or sterile water, and 1791 proteins were quantified. A total of 102 differentially expressed proteins were obtained, of which 66 differential proteins were upregulated and 36 downregulated in the treatment group. Annotation and enrichment analysis of these peptides and proteins using the GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) databases with bioinformatics software showed that the differentially expressed protein functional annotation items were mainly concentrated on biological processes and cell components. The LC-PRM/MS (liquid chromatography-parallel reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry) quantitative analysis technique was used to quantitatively analyze 11 differential candidate proteins obtained by TMT combined with LC-MS/MS. The up-down trend of 10 differential proteins in the PRM results was consistent with that of the TMT quantitative analysis. The coincidence rate of the two results was 91%, which confirmed the reliability of the proteomic results. Therefore, the differentially expressed proteins and signaling pathways discovered here may be the further concern for the bamboo-pathogen interaction studies.",

We also demonstrated that MinC<sub>N</sub> (the N-terminal phosphatase domain of MinC), MinD (uracil phosphoribosyltransferase), and MinT (transporter) function together as the safeguard enzymes, which collaboratively constitute an unusual self-resistance system. Finally, we provided evidence that MinD, utilizing an unprecedented substrate-competition strategy for self-resistance of the producer cell, maintains competition advantage over the active molecule MIN-5'-monophosphate by increasing the UMP pool inÂ vivo.

And its pathogenesis and mechanism of drug resistance has been partially clarified, especially for the signal pathway of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The targeting therapy of EGFR signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has achieved a certain effect, but the two mutation of EGFR and other mechanisms of lung cancer resistance still greatly reduce the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy on it. MicroRNA is an endogenous non coding RNA, which has a regulatory function after transcriptional level. Recent studies on the mechanism of lung cancer resistance have found that a variety of microRNAs are related to the mechanism of lung cancer drug-resistance. They can regulate lung cancer resistance by participating in signal pathways, drug resistance genes and cell apoptosis, thus affecting the sensitivity of cancer cells to drugs. Therefore, microRNAs can be used as a specific target for the treatment of lung cancer and plays a vital role in the early diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of lung cancer. This article reviews the mechanisms of lung cancer resistance and its relationship with microRNAs.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The war on multidrug resistance (MDR) has resulted in the greatest loss to the world's economy. Antibiotics, the bedrock, and wonder drug of the 20th century have played a central role in treating infectious diseases. However, the inappropriate, irregular, and irrational uses of antibiotics have resulted in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. This has resulted in an increased interest in medicinal plants since 30-50% of current pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals are plant-derived. The question we address in this review is whether plants, which produce a rich diversity of secondary metabolites, may provide novel antibiotics to tackle MDR microbes and novel chemosensitizers to reclaim currently used antibiotics that have been rendered ineffective by the MDR microbes. Plants synthesize secondary metabolites and phytochemicals and have great potential to act as therapeutics. The main focus of this mini-review is to highlight the potential benefits of plant derived multiple compounds and the importance of phytochemicals for the development of biocompatible therapeutics. In addition, this review focuses on the diverse effects and efficacy of herbal compounds in controlling the development of MDR in microbes and hopes to inspire research into unexplored plants with a view to identify novel antibiotics for global health benefits.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as an obstacle in the supple administration of antimicrobial agents to critical diarrheal patients. Most diarrheal pathogens have developed resistance against the major classes of antibiotics commonly used for assuaging diarrheal symptoms. Antimicrobial resistance develops when pathogens acquire antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) through genetic recombination from commensals and pathogens. These are the constituents of the complex microbiota in all ecological niches. The recombination events may occur in the environment or in the gut. Containment of AMR can be achieved through a complete understanding of the complex and diverse structure and function of the microbiota. Its taxonomic entities serve as focal points for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genetic determinants. Molecular methods complemented with culture-based diagnostics have been historically implemented to document these natural events. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the field of molecular epidemiology. It has revolutionized the method of addressing relevant problems like diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases and the issue of antimicrobial resistance. Metagenomics is one such next-generation technique that has proved to be a monumental advancement in the area of molecular taxonomy. Current understanding of structure, function and dysbiosis of microbiota associated with antimicrobial resistance was realized due to its conception. This review describes the major milestones achieved due to the advent and implementation of this new technique in the context of antimicrobial resistance. These achievements span a wide panorama from the discovery of novel microorganisms to invention of translational value.",

The enzyme provides a branch from the standard electron transport chain by transferring electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen. In standard laboratory strains, <i>aod-1</i> is transcribed at very low levels under normal growth conditions. However, if the standard electron transport chain is disrupted, a<i>od-1</i> mRNA expression is induced and the AOD1 protein is produced. We previously identified a strain of <i>N. crassa</i>, that produces high levels of <i>aod-1</i> transcript under non-inducing conditions.

        "pmc_abstract": "The increasing threat posed by multiresistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the discovery of novel antibacterials with unprecedented modes of action. ADEP1, a natural compound produced by <i>Streptomyces hawaiiensis</i> NRRL 15010, is the prototype for a new class of acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics. ADEP antibiotics deregulate the proteolytic core ClpP of the bacterial caseinolytic protease, thereby exhibiting potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens. ADEP1 and derivatives, here collectively called ADEP, have been previously investigated for their antibiotic potency against different species, structure-activity relationship, and mechanism of action; however, knowledge on the biosynthesis of the natural compound and producer self-resistance have remained elusive. In this study, we identified and analyzed the ADEP biosynthetic gene cluster in <i>S. hawaiiensis</i> NRRL 15010, which comprises two NRPSs, genes necessary for the biosynthesis of (4<i>S</i>,2<i>R</i>)-4-methylproline, and a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) for the assembly of highly reduced polyenes. While no resistance factor could be identified within the gene cluster itself, we discovered an additional <i>clpP</i> homologous gene (named <i>clpP</i><sub>ADEP</sub>) located further downstream of the biosynthetic genes, separated from the biosynthetic gene cluster by several transposable elements. Heterologous expression of ClpP<sub>ADEP</sub> in three ADEP-sensitive <i>Streptomyces</i> species proved its role in conferring ADEP resistance, thereby revealing a novel type of antibiotic resistance determinant.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Antibiotic acyldepsipeptides (ADEPs) represent a promising new class of potent antibiotics and, at the same time, are valuable tools to study the molecular functioning of their target, ClpP, the proteolytic core of the bacterial caseinolytic protease. Here, we present a straightforward purification procedure for ADEP1 that yields substantial amounts of the pure compound in a time- and cost-efficient manner, which is a prerequisite to conveniently study the antimicrobial effects of ADEP and the operating mode of bacterial ClpP machineries in diverse bacteria. Identification and characterization of the ADEP biosynthetic gene cluster in <i>Streptomyces hawaiiensis</i> NRRL 15010 enables future bioinformatics screenings for similar gene clusters and/or subclusters to find novel natural compounds with specific substructures. Most strikingly, we identified a cluster-associated <i>clpP</i> homolog (named <i>clpP</i><sub>ADEP</sub>) as an ADEP resistance gene. ClpP<sub>ADEP</sub> constitutes a novel bacterial resistance factor that alone is necessary and sufficient to confer high-level ADEP resistance to <i>Streptomyces</i> across species.",

Analysis of the atratumycin biosynthetic gene cluster (<i>atr</i>) revealed that its biosynthesis is regulated by multiple factors, including two LuxR regulatory genes (<i>atr1</i> and <i>atr2</i>), two ABC transporter genes (<i>atr29</i> and <i>atr30</i>) and one <i>Streptomyces</i> antibiotic regulatory gene (<i>atr32</i>). In this work, three regulatory and two transporter genes were unambiguously determined to provide positive, negative and self-protective roles during biosynthesis of atratumycin through bioinformatic analyses, gene inactivations and <i>trans</i>-complementation studies. Notably, an unusual <i>Streptomyces</i> antibiotic regulatory protein Atr32 was characterized as a negative regulator; the function of Atr32 is distinct from previous studies. Five over-expression mutant strains were constructed by rational application of the regulatory and transporter genes; the resulting strains produced significantly improved titers of atratumycin that were ca. 1.7-2.3 fold greater than wild-type (WT) producer. Furthermore, the atratumycin gene cluster was successfully expressed in <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> M1154, thus paving the way for the transfer and recombination of large DNA fragments. Overall, this finding sets the stage for understanding the unique biosynthesis of pharmaceutically important atratumycin and lays the foundation for generating anti-tuberculosis lead compounds possessing novel structures.",

Here, we report that the mildew resistance locus O (MLO) genes, <i>CsMLO1</i> and <i>CsMLO2</i>, are both negative modulators of the cucumber defense response to <i>C. cassiicola</i>. Subcellular localization analysis showed that CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 are localized in the plasma membrane. Expression analysis indicated that the transcript levels of <i>CsMLO1</i> and <i>CsMLO2</i> are linked to the defense response to <i>C. cassiicola</i>. Transient overexpression of either <i>CsMLO1</i> or <i>CsMLO2</i> in cucumber cotyledons reduced resistance to <i>C. cassiicola</i>, whereas silencing of either <i>CsMLO1</i> or <i>CsMLO2</i> enhanced resistance to <i>C. cassiicola</i>. The relationships of pathogenesis-related proteins, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated genes, and abscisic acid (ABA)-related genes to the overexpression and silencing of <i>CsMLO1</i>/<i>CsMLO2</i> in non-infested cucumber plants were investigated. The results indicated that <i>CsMLO1</i> mediated resistance against <i>C. cassiicola</i> by regulating the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins and ROS-associated genes, as well as through ABA signaling pathway-associated genes.

        "pmc_abstract": "Dityromycin is a peptide antibiotic isolated from the culture broth of the soil microorganism <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. strain AM-2504. Recent structural studies have shown that dityromycin targets the ribosomal protein S12 in the 30S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting translocation. Herein, by using <i>in vitro</i> protein synthesis assays, we identified the resistance mechanism of the producer strain to the secondary metabolite dityromycin. The results show that the self-resistance mechanism of the <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. strain AM-2504 is due to a specific modification of the ribosome. In particular, two amino acid substitutions, located in a highly conserved region of the S12 protein corresponding to the binding site of the antibiotic, were found. These mutations cause a substantial loss of affinity of the dityromycin for the 30S ribosomal subunit, protecting the producer strain from the toxic effect of the antibiotic. In addition to providing a detailed description of the first mechanism of self-resistance based on a mutated ribosomal protein, this work demonstrates that the molecular determinants of the dityromycin resistance identified in <i>Streptomyces</i> can be transferred to <i>Escherichia coli</i> ribosomes, where they can trigger the same antibiotic resistance mechanism found in the producer strain.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The World Health Organization has identified antimicrobial resistance as a substantial threat to human health. Because of the emergence of pathogenic bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics worldwide, there is a need to identify the mode of action of antibiotics and to unravel the basic mechanisms responsible for drug resistance. Antibiotic producers' microorganisms can protect themselves from the toxic effect of the drug using different strategies; one of the most common involves the modification of the antibiotic's target site. In this work, we report a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanism, based on protein modification, devised by the soil microorganism <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. strain AM-2504 to protect itself from the activity of the peptide antibiotic dityromycin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism can be reproduced in <i>E. coli</i>, thereby eliciting antibiotic resistance in this human commensal bacterium.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antibiotic resistance poses a tremendous threat to human health. To overcome this problem, it is essential to know the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in antibiotic-producing and pathogenic bacteria. This paper deals with this problem from four points of view. First, the antibiotic resistance genes in producers are discussed related to their biosynthesis. Most resistance genes are present within the biosynthetic gene clusters, but some genes such as paromomycin acetyltransferases are located far outside the gene cluster. Second, when the antibiotic resistance genes in pathogens are compared with those in the producers, resistance mechanisms have dependency on antibiotic classes, and, in addition, new types of resistance mechanisms such as Eis aminoglycoside acetyltransferase and self-sacrifice proteins in enediyne antibiotics emerge in pathogens. Third, the relationships of the resistance genes between producers and pathogens are reevaluated at their amino acid sequence as well as nucleotide sequence levels. Pathogenic bacteria possess other resistance mechanisms than those in antibiotic producers. In addition, resistance mechanisms are little different between early stage of antibiotic use and the present time, e.g., Î²-lactam resistance in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Lastly, guanine + cytosine (GC) barrier in gene transfer to pathogenic bacteria is considered. Now, the resistance genes constitute resistome composed of complicated mixture from divergent environments.",

In this work, we mapped the cell-surface mechanical property of single cells inÂ situ before and after static point loading these cells using atomic force microscopy in PeakForce-Quantitative Nano Mechanics mode. Cell-surface stiffness was elevated at a maximum of 1.35-fold at the vicinity of loading site, indicating an enhanced structural protection of the cortex to the cell. Mechanical modeling also elucidated the structural protection from the stiffened cell cortex, in which 9-15% and 10-19% decrease of maximum stress and strain of the nucleus were obtained. Furthermore, the flat-ended atomic force microscopy probes were used to capture cytoskeleton reorganization after point loading quantitatively, revealing that the larger the applied force and the longer the loading time are, the more pronounced cytoskeleton reorganization is. Also, point loading using a microneedle combined with real-time confocal microscopy uncovered the fast dynamics of actin cytoskeleton reorganization for actin-stained live cells after point loading (<10 s). These results furthered the understandings in the transmission of localized mechanical forces into an adherent cell.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Over the past 30 years, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which have proliferated due to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Over this same time period, however, there has also been a decline in the number of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action coming to market. Therefore, there is a growing need for an increase in the speed at which new antibiotics are discovered and developed. Natural products produced by bacteria have been and continue to be a robust source of novel antibiotics; however, new and complementary methods for screening large bacterial libraries for novel antibiotic production are needed due to the current agar methods being limited in scope, time consuming, and prone to error. Herein, we describe a rapid, robust, and quantitative high-throughput liquid culture screening method for antibiotic production by bacteria. This method has the ability to screen both mono- and coculture mixtures of bacteria <i>in vitro</i> and be adapted to other phenotypic natural product analyses. Over 260 bacterial species were screened in monoculture, and 38 and 34% were found to produce antibiotics capable of inhibition of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> or <i>Escherichia coli</i>, respectively, with 8 and 4% being classified as strong producers (â¥30% growth inhibition), respectively. Bacteria found to not produce antibiotics in monoculture were also screened in coculture using an adaptation of this method. Of the more than 270 cocultures screened, 14 and 30% were found to produce antibiotics capable of inhibition of <i>S. aureus</i> or <i>E. coli</i>, respectively. Of those bacteria found to produce antibiotics in monoculture, 43 bacteria were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and found to be majority <i>Pseudomonas</i> (37%), <i>Serratia</i> (19%), and <i>Bacillus</i> (14%) bacteria, but two novel producers, <i>Herbaspirillum</i> and <i>Kluyvera</i>, were also found.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are organized groups of genes involved in the production of specialized metabolites. Typically, one BGC is responsible for the production of one or several similar compounds with bioactivities that usually only vary in terms of strength and/or specificity. Here we show that the previously described ferroverdins and bagremycins, which are families of metabolites with different bioactivities, are produced from the same BGC, whereby the fate of the biosynthetic pathway depends on iron availability. Under conditions of iron depletion, the monomeric bagremycins are formed, representing amino-aromatic antibiotics resulting from the condensation of 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid with <i>p</i>-vinylphenol. Conversely, when iron is abundantly available, the biosynthetic pathway additionally produces a molecule based on <i>p</i>-vinylphenyl-3-nitroso-4-hydroxybenzoate, which complexes iron to form the trimeric ferroverdins that have anticholesterol activity. Thus, our work shows a unique exception to the concept that BGCs should only produce a single family of molecules with one type of bioactivity and that in fact different bioactive molecules may be produced depending on the environmental conditions.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Access to whole-genome sequences has exposed the general incidence of the so-called cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), thereby renewing their interest for natural product discovery. As a consequence, genome mining is the often first approach implemented to assess the potential of a microorganism for producing novel bioactive metabolites. By revealing a new level of complexity of natural product biosynthesis, we further illustrate the difficulty of estimation of the panel of molecules associated with a BGC based on genomic information alone. Indeed, we found that the same gene cluster is responsible for the production of compounds which differ in terms of structure and bioactivity. The production of these different compounds responds to different environmental triggers, which suggests that multiplication of culture conditions is essential for revealing the entire panel of molecules made by a single BGC.",

These compounds are trace-level metabolites formed by derailment of the major biosynthetic pathway. Inspired by evolutionary logic we show that rational mutation of a single gene in the biosynthetic gene cluster encoding an antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase (ABM) superfamily protein leads to a significant increase both in total formicapyridine production and their enrichment relative to the fasamycins/formicamycins.

We included cross-sectional and longitudinal quantitative and qualitative studies that 1) examined coping strategies regarding oral health in persons with schizophrenia or 2) examined coping strategies were used in dental care. We included studies conducted with at least one PWS aged 18 years old more and without restriction on sex, socioeconomic status, or language.<h4>Results</h4>The 8 studies included suggest that coping strategies depends on complex translation processes that can be either personal (e.g., psychological symptomatology, neuropsychological functioning to adversely affect hope, self-esteem, self-stigma, self-determination, sense of coherence, and resilience) and/or environmental factors (e.g., peer support and efficacy of rehabilitations programs). We further identified that the main factor influencing coping strategies was dental stress situation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This review suggests that coping strategies play a crucial role in the recovery process for oral health of PWS. Translation processes in oral health should be more explored in the future to clarify the capacity of PWS to cope with essential self-care in oral health on daily life.",

Three dipeptide compounds were purified from its cell-free cultural broth and identified as (Â±)-nematophin, <i>cyclo</i> (L-Pro-Gly), and <i>N</i>, <i>N'</i>-dimethyl-<i>cyclo</i> (L-Phe-L-Leu). Nematophin demonstrated a wider antifungal spectrum than the other two compounds. It also exhibited strong inhibitory effects on mycelial growth of <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> and <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 40.00 and 51.25 Î¼g/ml, respectively. Its (<i>S</i>)-configuration structure [(+)-nematophin] was also synthesized and exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the enantiomeric mixture. The detached leaf assay revealed that nematophin possessed significant preventive and curative efficacy against <i>R. solani</i> on broad bean leaves showing corresponding control efficacies of 93.01 and 94.93% at 1,000 Î¼g/ml, comparable to those of a chemical fungicide (carbendazim) at 500 Î¼g/ml. Additionally, the pot experiments indicated that nematophin could effectively inhibit the disease extension on rice and broad bean plants caused by <i>R. solani</i>. Nematophin also exerted some adverse influences on the sclerotial development of <i>R. solani</i> by dramatically suppressing their formation and maturation at 40.00 Î¼g/ml, as well as their germination at 15.00 Î¼g/ml. Morphological and ultrastructural observations showed that the hyphae of <i>R. solani</i> became twisted, shriveled, and deformed at the growing points after exposure to nematophin at 40.00 Î¼g/ml, and that the subcellular fractions also became abnormal concurrently, especially the mitochondrial structure. These results indicate that nematophin has great potential to be used as a bio-pesticide in agricultural production.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms has led to an increased need for the discovery and development of novel antimicrobial compounds. Frequent rediscovery of the same natural products (NPs) continues to decrease the likelihood of the discovery of new compounds from soil bacteria. Thus, efforts have shifted toward investigating microorganisms and their secondary metabolite biosynthesis potential, from diverse niche environments, such as those isolated from marine sponges. Here we investigated at the genomic level two <i>Streptomyces</i> spp. strains, namely SM17 and SM18, isolated from the marine sponge <i>Haliclona simulans</i>, with previously reported antimicrobial activity against clinically relevant pathogens; using single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. We performed a series of comparative genomic analyses on SM17 and SM18 with their closest terrestrial relatives, namely <i>S. albus</i> J1074 and <i>S. pratensis</i> ATCC 33331 respectively; in an effort to provide further insights into potential environmental niche adaptations (ENAs) of marine sponge-associated <i>Streptomyces</i>, and on how these adaptations might be linked to their secondary metabolite biosynthesis potential. Prediction of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs) indicated that, even though the marine isolates are closely related to their terrestrial counterparts at a genomic level; they potentially produce different compounds. SM17 and SM18 displayed a better ability to grow in high salinity medium when compared to their terrestrial counterparts, and further analysis of their genomes indicated that they possess a pool of 29 potential ENA genes that are absent in <i>S. albus</i> J1074 and <i>S. pratensis</i> ATCC 33331. This ENA gene pool included functional categories of genes that are likely to be related to niche adaptations and which could be grouped based on potential biological functions such as osmotic stress, defense; transcriptional regulation; symbiotic interactions; antimicrobial compound production and resistance; ABC transporters; together with horizontal gene transfer and defense-related features.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Marine natural products represent novel and diverse chemotypes that serve as templates for the discovery and development of therapeutic agents with distinct mechanisms of action. These genetically encoded compounds produced by an evolutionary optimized biosynthetic machinery are usually quite complex and can be difficult to recreate in the laboratory. The isolation from the source organism results in limited amount of material; however, the development of advanced NMR technologies and dereplication strategies has enabled the structure elucidation on small scale. In order to rigorously explore the therapeutic potential of marine natural products and advance them further, the biological characterization has to keep pace with the chemical characterization. The limited marine natural product supply has been a serious challenge for thorough investigation of the biological targets. Several marine drugs have reached the markets or are in clinical trials, where those challenges have been overcome, including through the development of scalable syntheses. However, the identification of mechanisms of action of marine natural products early in the discovery process is potentially game changing, since effectively linking marine natural products to potential therapeutic applications in turn triggers motivation to tackle challenging syntheses and solve the supply problem. An increasing number of sensitive technologies and methods have been developed in recent years, some of which have been successfully applied to marine natural products, increasing the value of these compounds with respect to their biomedical utility. In this review, we discuss advances in overcoming the bottlenecks in marine natural product research, emphasizing on the development and advances of diverse target identification technologies applicable for marine natural product research.",

However, mining for a variety of BGCs quickly approaches a complexity level where manual analyses are no longer possible and require the use of automated genome mining pipelines, such as the antiSMASH software. In this review, we discuss the principles underlying the predictions of antiSMASH and other tools and provide practical advice for their application. Furthermore, we discuss important caveats such as rule-based BGC detection, sequence and annotation quality and cluster boundary prediction, which all have to be considered while planning for, performing and analyzing the results of genome mining studies.",

However, the role of trichothecene efflux pump homologues in non-producing fusaria such as F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum was not investigated in detail. Analysis of the homologues of trichothecene efflux pump from multiple fungal species allowed us to uncover and catalogue functional gene copies of conserved structure. Putative Tri12 candidates in Fusarium oxysporum and F. proliferatum were characterised via expression profiling in response to different trigger compounds, providing supporting evidence for role of Tri12 homologues in the resistance to trichothecenes. Our analysis of Tri12 phylogeny also suggests that efflux-mediated trichothecene resistance is likely to predate the divergence of Trichoderma and Fusarium species. On the regulatory level, we posit that the increased tolerance of trichothecenes by F. oxysporum is possibly related to the decoupling of Tri12 homologue expression from pH, due to the deletion of PACC/RIM101 transcription factor binding site in its promoter region.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Much recent interest has arisen in investigating <i>Streptomyces</i> isolates derived from the marine environment in the search for new bioactive compounds, particularly those found in association with marine invertebrates, such as sponges. Among these new compounds recently identified from marine <i>Streptomyces</i> isolates are the octapeptidic surugamides, which have been shown to possess anticancer and antifungal activities. By employing genome mining followed by an one strain many compounds (OSMAC)-based approach, we have identified the previously unreported capability of a marine sponge-derived isolate, namely <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. SM17, to produce surugamide A. Phylogenomics analyses provided novel insights on the distribution and conservation of the surugamides biosynthetic gene cluster (<i>sur</i> BGC) and suggested a closer relatedness between marine-derived <i>sur</i> BGCs than their terrestrially derived counterparts. Subsequent analysis showed differential production of surugamide A when comparing the closely related marine and terrestrial isolates, namely <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. SM17 and <i>Streptomyces albidoflavus</i> J1074. SM17 produced higher levels of surugamide A than <i>S. albidoflavus</i> J1074 under all conditions tested, and in particular producing >13-fold higher levels when grown in YD and 3-fold higher levels in SYP-NaCl medium. In addition, surugamide A production was repressed in TSB and YD medium, suggesting that carbon catabolite repression (CCR) may influence the production of surugamides in these strains.",

Here, we present structures of saxiphilin (Sxph), a bullfrog high-affinity STX-binding protein, alone and bound to STX. The structures reveal a novel high-affinity STX-binding site built from a \"proto-pocket\" on a transferrin scaffold that also bears thyroglobulin domain protease inhibitor repeats. Comparison of Sxph and voltage-gated sodium channel STX-binding sites reveals a convergent toxin recognition strategy comprising a largely rigid binding site where acidic side chains and a cation-Ï interaction engage STX. These studies reveal molecular rules for STX recognition, outline how a toxin-binding site can be built on a naÃ¯ve scaffold, and open a path to developing protein sensors for environmental STX monitoring and new biologics for STX intoxication mitigation.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Discovering new antibiotics is vital to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance. Most currently used antibiotics originate from the natural products of actinomycete bacteria, particularly <i>Streptomyces</i> species, that were discovered over 60 years ago. However, genome sequencing has revealed that most antibiotic-producing microorganisms encode many more natural products than previously thought. Biosynthesis of these natural products is tightly regulated by global and cluster situated regulators (CSRs), most of which respond to unknown environmental stimuli, and this likely explains why many biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are not expressed under laboratory conditions. One approach towards novel natural product discovery is to awaken these cryptic BGCs by re-wiring the regulatory control mechanism(s). Most CSRs bind intergenic regions of DNA in their own BGC to control compound biosynthesis, but some CSRs can control the biosynthesis of multiple natural products by binding to several different BGCs. These cross-cluster regulators present an opportunity for natural product discovery, as the expression of multiple BGCs can be affected through the manipulation of a single regulator. This review describes examples of these different mechanisms, including specific examples of cross-cluster regulation, and assesses the impact that this knowledge may have on the discovery of novel natural products.",

Besides identification of the oxygenase MpaB' as the long-sought key enzyme responsible for the oxidative cleavage of the farnesyl side chain, we reveal the intriguing pattern of compartmentalization for the MPA biosynthetic enzymes, including the cytosolic polyketide synthase MpaC' and <i>O</i>-methyltransferase MpaG', the Golgi apparatus-associated prenyltransferase MpaA', the endoplasmic reticulum-bound oxygenase MpaB' and P450-hydrolase fusion enzyme MpaDE', and the peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydrolase MpaH'. The whole pathway is elegantly comediated by these compartmentalized enzymes, together with the peroxisomal Î²-oxidation machinery.

To understand how <i>D. zeae</i> EC1 can protect itself from the antimicrobial activity of zeamines, we tested whether the ABC transporter genes within the <i>zms</i> (zeamine synthesis) gene cluster were related to zeamine resistance. Our results ruled out the possible involvement of these ABC transporters in zeamine resistance and instead unveiled an RND (resistance-nodulation-cell division) efflux pump, DesABC, which plays an important role in zeamine resistance in <i>D. zeae</i> EC1. The <i>desAB</i> genes are located next to the <i>zms</i> gene cluster, but <i>desC</i> is at a distant location in the bacterial genome. Null mutation of the <i>desABC</i> genes in a zeamine-minus derivative of strain EC1 led to about an 8- to 32-fold decrease in zeamine tolerance level. This efflux pump was zeamine specific and appeared to be conserved only in <i>Dickeya</i> species, which may explain the high potency of zeamines against a wide range of bacterial pathogens. Significantly, expression of the <i>desAB</i> genes was abolished by deletion of <i>zmsA</i>, which encodes zeamine biosynthesis but could be induced by exogenous addition of zeamines. The results suggest that sophisticated and coordinated regulatory mechanisms have evolved to govern zeamine production and tolerance. Taken together, these findings documented a novel signaling role of zeamines and the first resistance mechanism against zeamines, which is a family of potent and promising antibiotics against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Zeamines are a family of newly identified phytotoxins and potent antibiotics produced by <i>D. zeae</i> EC1. Unlike most bacterial organisms, which are highly sensitive, <i>D. zeae</i> EC1 is tolerant to zeamines, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. Our study showed, for the first time, that a new RND efflux pump, DesABC, is indispensable for <i>D. zeae</i> EC1 against zeamines. We found that the DesABC efflux pump was zeamine specific and appeared to be conserved only in the <i>Dickeya</i> species, which may explain the high potency of zeamines against a wide range of bacterial pathogens. We also showed that expression of DesABC efflux system genes was induced by zeamines. These findings not only provide an answer to why <i>D. zeae</i> EC1 is much more tolerant to zeamines than other bacterial pathogens but also document a signaling role of zeamines in modulation of gene expression.",

The training protocol consisted of two sets of 10 repetitions of knee extension, hip abduction, and hip flexion, using an elastic band in a sitting or supine position. Primary outcome measures included muscle strength, measured by percent knee extension muscle power to dry body weight (pKEMP-dBW), and physical performance, measured by short physical performance battery (SPPB). The adjusted mean differences in these variables during the 6âmonths were estimated using a multivariate linear regression model.<h4>Results</h4>The mean age with standard deviation was 70âÂ±â11âyears. One hundred and sixty patients (52.3%) were men and the dry weight was 55.6âÂ±â11.3âkg. Sarcopenia, defined as SPPB â¤8, was present in 21.4% patients. Their hemodialysis adequacy was acceptable, with a Kt/V of 1.65âÂ±â0.29, and their nutritional status was good, with a normalized protein catabolism rate of 0.89âÂ±â0.18âg/kg/day. During the 6âmonths, both pKEMP-dBW and SPPB showed a slight but significant increase with an adjusted mean difference of 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.3-4.3, pâ<âÂ 0.001) and 0.6 (0.4-0.9, pâ<âÂ 0.001), respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Six-month resistance training was associated with improved muscle strength and physical performance in patients with MHD.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Fungal secondary metabolites are a rich source of valuable natural products, and genome sequencing has revealed a proliferation of predicted biosynthetic gene clusters in the genomes. However, it is currently an unfeasible task to characterize all biosynthetic gene clusters and to identify possible uses of the compounds. Therefore, a rational approach is needed to identify a short list of gene clusters responsible for producing valuable compounds. To this end, several bioactive clusters include a resistance gene, which is a paralog of the target gene inhibited by the compound. This mechanism can be used to identify these clusters. We have developed the FRIGG (fungal resistance gene-directed genome mining) pipeline for identifying this type of biosynthetic gene cluster based on homology patterns of the cluster genes. In this work, the FRIGG pipeline was run using 51 <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Penicillium</i> genomes, identifying 72 unique families of putative resistance genes. The pipeline also identified the previously characterized resistance gene <i>inpE</i> from the fellutamide B cluster, thereby validating the approach. We have successfully developed an approach to identify putative valuable bioactive clusters based on a specific resistance mechanism. This approach will be highly useful as an ever-increasing amount of genomic data becomes available; the art of identifying and selecting the right clusters producing novel valuable compounds will only become more crucial. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Species belonging to the <i>Aspergillus</i> genus are known to produce a large number of secondary metabolites; some of these compounds are used as pharmaceuticals, such as penicillin, cyclosporine, and statin. With whole-genome sequencing, it became apparent that the genetic potential for secondary metabolite production is much larger than expected. As an increasing number of species are whole-genome sequenced, thousands of secondary metabolite genes are predicted, and the question of how to selectively identify novel bioactive compounds from this information arises. To address this question, we have created a pipeline to predict genes involved in the production of bioactive compounds based on a resistance gene hypothesis approach.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Effect of microRNA-27b (miR-27b) on cisplatin chemotherapy sensitivity of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was investigated to provide a reference for clinical prevention of OSCC cell resistance. The clinical tissues of 34 patients with OSCC-resistant cancer and 28 patients with cisplatin-sensitive OSCC in Nanjing General Hospital were collected. The expression levels of miR-27b and Frizzled-7 (FZD7) in cancer tissues were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reation (RT-qPCR). After a certain gradient of cisplatin was used to induce stable acquired resistance of OSCC cell line Tca8113/CDDP, a dose of miR-27b was added to construct a cell line overexpressing miR-27b in the drug-resistant cell line. The effect of cisplatin on the proliferation of drug-resistant OSCC cells was detected by colony formation assay. In addition, the scratch test and Transwell formation assay was performed to examine the effect of cisplatin drug stimulation on proliferation and migration of Tca8113/CDDP. Flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining were used to detect the effect of miR-27b on apoptosis of OSCC-resistant cells after cisplatin chemotherapy. The expression level of miR-27b in cancer tissues of patients with drug-resistant OSCC was significantly lower than that of patients with OSCC cisplatin sensitivity (P<0.05). After high expression of miR-27b, the number of clones of drug-resistant OSCC cells after adding cisplatin drugs can be significantly inhibited. The proliferation and migration ability of drug-resistant OSCC was significantly decreased after the addition of cisplatin in miR-27b overexpression (P<0.05). miR-27 mimic enhanced the pro-apoptotic ability of cisplatin drugs (P<0.05). The expression of FZD7 in cisplation-resistant patients was significantly higher (P<0.05). miR-27b significantly inhibited the expression of FZD7 and Î²-catenin proteins. miR-27b can inhibit the resistance of OSCC to cisplatin drugs, increase apoptosis of cancer cells, and inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of FZD7/Î²-catenin signaling pathway activation in drug-resistant cell lines by miR-27b.",

In the past several years, however, BER was found to play additional roles in genome maintenance and metabolism, including sequence-specific restriction modification and repair of bulky adducts and interstrand crosslinks. Central to this expanded biological utility are specialized DNA glycosylases - enzymes that selectively excise damaged, modified, or mismatched nucleobases.

Whole genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the capacity to produce a far greater number of SMs than have been isolated, since many of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions. There has been significant effort to activate SM biosynthetic genes and link them to their downstream products, as the SMs produced by these \"cryptic\" pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery. Further, an understanding of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis facilitates product yield optimization of first-generation molecules and genetic engineering of second-generation analogs. This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs produced by <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i>, <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, and <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> in the past six years (2012-2018).

This study showed that glucose addition benefited on cell growth and the early transcription of genes involved in substrate accumulation and toxin synthesis, but it played a negative role in the final production of cereulide. Meanwhile, a lasting enhancement of <i>cesH</i> transcription was observed with the addition of glucose. Moreover, the cereulide production in Î<i>cesH</i> was obviously higher than that in the wild type. This indicates that CesH has a repression effect on cereulide production. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that CesH was an alpha/beta hydrolase that probably associated with the cell membrane, which was verified by subcellular localization. The esterase activity against para-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPC2) of the recombinant CesH was confirmed. Although no sign of ester bond cleavage in cereulide or valinomycin was demonstrated in in vitro assays, CesH could reverse the cereulide analogue sensitivity of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in vivo, by which toxin degradation was facilitated. Moreover, site directed mutations identified that the conserved catalytic triad of CesH might consist of Serine 86, Glutamate 199, and Histidine 227. These results help us to understand the regulation of cereulide production and provide clues for developing control measurements.",

Traditionally, novel compounds produced by bacteria were discovered via conventional bioprospecting based on isolation of potential producers and screening their extracts in a variety of bioassays. Over time, most of the natural products identifiable by this approach were discovered, and the pipeline for new drugs based on bacterially produced metabolites started to run dry. This mini-review highlights recent developments in bacterial bioprospecting for novel compounds that are based on several out-of-the-box approaches, including the following: (i) targeting bacterial species previously unknown to produce any bioactive natural products, (ii) exploring non-traditional environmental niches and methods for isolation of bacteria and (iii) various types of 'genome mining' aimed at unravelling genetic potential of bacteria to produce secondary metabolites. All these approaches have already yielded a number of novel bioactive compounds and, if used wisely, will soon revitalize drug discovery pipeline based on bacterial natural products.",

In this work, we identified the actinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) <i>acn</i> by detailed analyses of the <i>S. costaricanus</i> SCSIO ZS0073 genome. This organism produces actinomycin D with a titer of ~69.8 Î¼g mL<sup>-1</sup> along with traces of actinomycin X<i><sub>oÎ²</sub></i>. The <i>acn</i> cluster localized to a 39.8 kb length region consisting of 25 open reading frames (ORFs), including a set of four genes that drive the construction of the 4-methyl-3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid (4-MHA) precursor and three non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that generate the 4-MHA pentapeptide semi-lactone, which, upon dimerization, affords final actinomycin D. Furthermore, the <i>acn</i> cluster contains four positive regulatory genes <i>acnWU4RO</i>, which were identified by in vivo gene inactivation studies. Our data provide insights into the genetic characteristics of this new mangrove-derived actinomycin D bioproducer, enabling future metabolic engineering campaigns to improve both titers and the structural diversities possible for actinomycin D and related analogues.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Bacteria harbor an immense reservoir of potentially new and therapeutic small molecules in the form of \"silent\" biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). These BGCs can be identified bioinformatically but are sparingly expressed under normal laboratory growth conditions, or not at all, and therefore do not produce significant levels of the corresponding small molecule product. Several methods have been developed for activating silent BGCs. A major limitation for nearly all methods is that they require genetic procedures and/or do not report on the bioactivity of the cryptic metabolite. We herein report \"Bioactivty-HiTES\", an approach that links the bioactivity of cryptic metabolites to their induction while at the same time obviating the need for genetic manipulations. Using this method, we detected induction of cryptic antibiotics in three actinomycete strains that were tested. Follow-up studies in one case allowed us to structurally elucidate two cryptic metabolites, elicited by the Î²-blocker atenolol in Streptomyces hiroshimensis, with selective growth-inhibitory activity against Gram-negative bacteria, notably Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. Atenolol turned out to be a global elicitor of secondary metabolism, and characterization of additional cryptic metabolites led to the discovery of a novel naphthoquinone epoxide. Bioactivity-HiTES is a general, widely applicable procedure that will be useful in identifying cryptic bioactive metabolites in the future.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The activities of critical metabolic and regulatory proteins can be altered by exposure to natural or synthetic redox-cycling compounds. Many bacteria, therefore, possess mechanisms to transport or transform these small molecules. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 synthesizes phenazines, redox-active antibiotics that are toxic to other organisms but have beneficial effects for their producer. Phenazines activate the redox-sensing transcription factor SoxR and thereby induce the transcription of a small regulon, including the operon mexGHI-opmD, which encodes an efflux pump that transports phenazines, and PA14_35160 (pumA), which encodes a putative monooxygenase. Here, we provide evidence that PumA contributes to phenazine resistance and normal biofilm development, particularly during exposure to or production of strongly oxidizing N-methylated phenazines. We show that phenazine resistance depends on the presence of residues that are conserved in the active sites of other putative and characterized monooxygenases found in the antibiotic producer Streptomyces coelicolor. We also show that during biofilm growth, PumA is required for the conversion of phenazine methosulfate to unique phenazine metabolites. Finally, we compare âmexGHI-opmD and âpumA strains in assays for colony biofilm morphogenesis and SoxR activation, and find that these deletions have opposing phenotypic effects. Our results suggest that, while MexGHI-OpmD-mediated efflux has the effect of making the cellular phenazine pool more reducing, PumA acts on cellular phenazines to make the pool more oxidizing. We present a model in which these two SoxR targets function simultaneously to control the biological activity of the P. aeruginosa phenazine pool.",

We suggest greater sampling of spiders whose genomes are understudied but hold important protein recipes for silk and venom production. We further recommend arachnid genomes to address significant evolutionary topics, including the phenotypic impact of genome duplications.

        "pmc_abstract": "Burkholderia glumae converts the guanine base of guanosine triphosphate into an azapteridine and methylates both the pyrimidine and triazine rings to make toxoflavin. Strains of Burkholderia thailandensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei have a gene cluster encoding seven putative biosynthetic enzymes that resembles the toxoflavin gene cluster. Four of the enzymes are similar in sequence to BgToxBCDE, which have been proposed to make 1,6-didesmethyltoxoflavin (1,6-DDMT). One of the remaining enzymes, BthII1283 in B. thailandensis E264, is a predicted S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent N-methyltransferase that shows a low level of sequence identity to BgToxA, which sequentially methylates N6 and N1 of 1,6-DDMT to form toxoflavin. Here we show that, unlike BgToxA, BthII1283 catalyzes a single methyl transfer to N1 of 1,6-DDMT in vitro. In addition, we investigated the differences in reactivity and regioselectivity by determining crystal structures of BthII1283 with bound S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) or 1,6-DDMT and SAH. BthII1283 contains a class I methyltransferase fold and three unique extensions used for 1,6-DDMT recognition. The active site structure suggests that 1,6-DDMT is bound in a reduced form. The plane of the azapteridine ring system is orthogonal to its orientation in BgToxA. In BthII1283, the modeled SAM methyl group is directed toward the p orbital of N1, whereas in BgToxA, it is first directed toward an sp<sup>2</sup> orbital of N6 and then toward an sp<sup>2</sup> orbital of N1 after planar rotation of the azapteridine ring system. Furthermore, in BthII1283, N1 is hydrogen bonded to a histidine residue whereas BgToxA does not supply an obvious basic residue for either N6 or N1 methylation.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Rifamycin derivatives, such as rifampicin, have potent antibiotic activity and have long been used in the clinic as mainstay components for the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, and AIDS-associated mycobacterial infections. However, the extensive usage of these antibiotics has resulted in the rapid development of bacterial resistance. The resistance mechanisms mainly include mutations of the rifamycin target RNA polymerase of bacteria and enzymatic modifications of rifamycin antibiotics. One modification is the recently characterized rifamycin degradation catalyzed by Rox enzymes, which belong to the widely occurring flavin monooxygenases. Intriguingly, our recent sequence analysis revealed the rifamycin producers also encode Rox homologs that are not yet characterized. In this work, we expanded the study of the Rox-catalyzed rifamycin degradation. We first showed that the Rox proteins from rifamycin producers have the enzymatic rifamycin SV-degrading activity. Then we used the structurally diverse rifamycin compounds rifampicin and 16-demethylrifamycin W to probe the substrate scope and found that they each have a slightly different substrate scope. Finally, we demonstrated that Rox proteins can also catalyze the transformation of 16-demethylsalinisporamycin to 16-demethylsaliniketal A. Since 16-demethylsalinisporamycin and 16-demethylsaliniketal A are the counterpart analogs of salinisporamycin and saliniketal A, our biochemical findings not only uncover a previously uncharacterized self-resistance mechanism in the rifamycin producers, but also bridge the gap between the biosynthesis of the potential antitumor compound saliniketal A.",

Recently, studies investigated biodiversity and community composition in these ecosystems but the metabolic activity of the metacommunity has never been investigated. Using an untargeted metabolomics, we explored stress-response of communities spreading in two sites of the same location, subjected to increasing environmental pressure due to opposite sun exposure, accounted as main factor influencing the diversity and composition of these ecosystems. Overall, 331 altered metabolites (206 and 125 unique for north and south, respectively), distinguished the two differently exposed communities. We also selected 10 metabolites and performed two-stage Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to test them as potential biomarkers. We further focused on melanin and allantoin as protective substances; their concentration was highly different in the community in the shadow or in the sun.

        "pmc_abstract": "Natural products produced by bacteria found in unusual and poorly studied ecosystems, such as Lake Baikal, represent a promising source of new valuable drug leads. Here we report the isolation of a new <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. strain IB201691-2A from the Lake Baikal endemic mollusk <i>Benedictia baicalensis</i>. In the course of an activity guided screening three new angucyclines, named baikalomycins A-C, were isolated and characterized, highlighting the potential of poorly investigated ecological niches. Besides that, the strain was found to accumulate large quantities of rabelomycin and 5-hydroxy-rabelomycin, known shunt products in angucyclines biosynthesis. Baikalomycins A-C demonstrated varying degrees of anticancer activity. Rabelomycin and 5-hydroxy-rabelomycin further demonstrated antiproliferative activities. The structure elucidation showed that baikalomycin A is a modified aquayamycin with Î²-d-amicetose and two additional hydroxyl groups at unusual positions (6a and 12a) of aglycone. Baikalomycins B and C have alternating second sugars attached, Î±-l-amicetose and Î±-l-aculose, respectively. The gene cluster for baikalomycins biosynthesis was identified by genome mining, cloned using a transformation-associated recombination technique and successfully expressed in <i>S. albus</i> J1074. It contains a typical set of genes responsible for an angucycline core assembly, all necessary genes for the deoxy sugars biosynthesis, and three genes coding for the glycosyltransferase enzymes. Heterologous expression and deletion experiments allowed to assign the function of glycosyltransferases involved in the decoration of baikalomycins aglycone.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The antibiotic and heavy metal resistome of a chronically polluted soil (3S) obtained from an automobile workshop in Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria was deciphered via functional annotation of putative ORFs (open reading frames). Functional annotation of antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes in 3S metagenome was conducted using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), Antibiotic Resistance Gene-annotation (ARG-ANNOT) and Antibacterial Biocide and Metal Resistance Gene Database (BacMet). Annotation revealed detection of resistance genes for 15 antibiotic classes with the preponderance of beta lactamases, mobilized colistin resistance determinant (mcr), glycopepetide and tetracycline resistance genes, the OqxBgb and OqxA RND-type multidrug efflux pumps, among others. The dominance of resistance genes for antibiotics effective against members of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> indicate possible contamination with faecal materials. Annotation of heavy metal resistance genes revealed diverse resistance genes responsible for the uptake, transport, detoxification, efflux and regulation of copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel, chromium, cobalt, mercury, arsenic, iron, molybdenum and several others. Majority of the antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes detected in this study are borne on mobile genetic elements, which facilitate their spread and dissemination in the polluted soil. The presence of the heavy metal resistance genes is strongly believed to play a major role in the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes. This study has established that soil is a huge repertoire of antibiotic and heavy metal resistome and due to the intricate link between human, animals and the soil environment, it may be a major contributor to the proliferation of multidrug-resistant clinical pathogens.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Colicins are specific and potent toxins produced by <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> that result in the rapid elimination of sensitive cells. Colicin production is commonly found throughout microbial populations, suggesting its potential importance for bacterial survival in complex microbial environments. Nonetheless, as colicin biology has been predominately studied using synthetic models, it remains unclear how colicin production contributes to survival and fitness of a colicin-producing commensal strain in a natural environment. To address this gap, we took advantage of MP1, an <i>E. coli</i> strain that harbors a colicinogenic plasmid and is a natural colonizer of the murine gut. Using this model, we validated that MP1 is competent for colicin production and then directly interrogated the importance of colicin production and immunity for MP1 survival in the murine gut. We showed that colicin production is dispensable for sustained colonization in the unperturbed gut. A strain lacking colicin production or immunity shows minimal fitness defects and can resist displacement by colicin producers. This report extends our understanding of the role that colicin production may play for <i>E. coli</i> during gut colonization and suggests that colicin production is not essential for a commensal to persist in its physiologic niche in the absence of exogenous challenges.",

In this study, in order to improve AP-3 production, the reason for severe growth inhibition of the AP-3 producing strain <i>Actinosynnema pretiosum</i> WXR-24 under high concentrations of exogenous AP-3 was investigated. The cell division protein FtsZ, which is the analogue of Î²-tubulin in bacteria, was discovered to be the AP-3 target through structural comparison followed by a SPR biosensor assay. AP-3 was trapped into a less hydrophilic groove near the GTPase pocket on FtsZ by hydrogen bounding and hydrophobic interactions, as revealed by docking analysis. After overexpression of the <i>APASM_5716</i> gene coding for FtsZ in WXR-30, the resistance to AP-3 was significantly improved. Moreover, AP-3 yield was increased from 250.66 mg/L to 327.37 mg/L. After increasing the concentration of supplemented yeast extract, the final yield of AP-3 reached 371.16 mg/L. In summary, we demonstrate that the cell division protein FtsZ is newly identified as the bacterial target of AP-3, and improving resistance is an effective strategy to enhance AP-3 production.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The glycopeptide A40926, produced by the actinomycete Nonomuraea gerenzanensis, is the precursor of dalbavancin, a second-generation glycopeptide antibiotic approved for clinical use in the USA and Europe in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The final product of the biosynthetic pathway is an O-acetylated form of A40926 (acA40926). Glycopeptide biosynthesis in N. gerenzanensis is dependent upon the dbv gene cluster that encodes, in addition to the two essential positive regulators Dbv3 and Dbv4, the putative members of a two-component signal transduction system, specifically the response regulator Dbv6 and the sensor kinase Dbv22. The aim of this work was to assign a role to these two genes. Our results demonstrate that deletion of dbv22 leads to an increased antibiotic production with a concomitant reduction in glycopeptide resistance. Deletion of dbv6 results in a similar phenotype, although the effects are not as strong as in the Îdbv22 mutant. Consistently, quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that Dbv6 and Dbv22 negatively regulate the regulatory genes (dbv3 and dbv4), as well as some dbv biosynthetic genes (dbv23 and dbv24), whereas Dbv6 and Dbv22 positively regulate transcription of the single, cluster-associated resistance gene. Finally, we demonstrate that exogenously added acA40926 and its precursor A40926 can modulate transcription of dbv genes but with an opposite extent: A40926 strongly stimulates transcription of the Dbv6/Dbv22 target genes while acA40926 has a neutral or negative effect on transcription of those genes. We propose a model in which glycopeptide biosynthesis in N. gerenzanensis is modulated through a positive feedback by the biosynthetic precursor A40926 and a negative feedback by the final product acA40926. In addition to previously reported control systems, this sophisticated control loop might help the producing strain cope with the toxicity of its own product. This work, besides leading to improved glycopeptide producing strains, enlarges our knowledge on the regulation of glycopeptide biosynthesis in actinomycetes, setting N. gerenzanensis and its two-component system Dbv6-Dbv22 apart from other glycopeptide producers.",

Evolutionary changes can occur in the interaction dynamics between community members as they adapt to coexistence. Here, we report that the syntrophic interaction between <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> coculture change in their dynamics over evolutionary time. Specifically, <i>Geobacter</i> sp. dominance increases with adaptation within the cocultures, as determined through quantitative PCR and fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization. This suggests a transition from syntrophy to competition and demonstrates the rapid adaptive capacity of <i>Geobacter</i> spp. to dominate in cocultures with <i>P. aeruginosa</i> Early in coculture establishment, two single-nucleotide variants in the <i>G. sulfurreducens</i><i>fabI</i> and <i>tetR</i> genes emerged that were strongly selected for throughout coculture evolution with <i>P. aeruginosa</i> phenazine wild-type and phenazine-deficient mutants. Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) proteomics revealed that the <i>tetR</i> variant cooccurred with the upregulation of an adenylate cyclase transporter, CyaE, and a resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump notably known for antibiotic efflux. To determine whether antibiotic production was driving the increased expression of the multidrug efflux pump, we tested <i>Pseudomonas</i>-derived phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PHZ-1-CA) for its potential to inhibit <i>Geobacter</i> growth and drive selection of the <i>tetR</i> and <i>fabI</i> genetic variants. Despite its inhibitory properties, PHZ-1-CA did not drive variant selection, indicating that other antibiotics may drive overexpression of the efflux pump and CyaE or that a novel role exists for these proteins in the context of this interaction.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Geobacter</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. cohabit many of the same environments, where <i>Geobacter</i> spp. often dominate. Both bacteria are capable of extracellular electron transfer (EET) and play important roles in biogeochemical cycling. Although they recently in 2017 were demonstrated to undergo direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) with one another, the genetic evolution of this syntrophic interaction has not been examined. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of the cocultures before and after adaptive evolution to determine whether genetic selection is occurring. We also probe their interaction on a temporal level and determine whether their interaction dynamics change over the course of adaptive evolution. This study brings to light the multifaceted nature of interactions between just two microorganisms within a controlled environment and will aid in improving metabolic models of microbial communities comprising these two bacteria.",

Deep functional profiling of microbiomes provides an alternative source for the discovery of novel antibiotic producers and probiotics. Recently, we implemented this ultrahigh-throughput screening approach for the isolation of <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> strains efficiently producing the ribosome-targeting antibiotic amicoumacin A (Ami). Proteomics and metabolomics revealed essential insight into the activation of Ami biosynthesis. Here, we applied omics to boost Ami biosynthesis, providing the optimized cultivation conditions for high-scale production of Ami. Ami displayed a pronounced activity against <i>Lactobacillales</i> and <i>Staphylococcaceae</i>, including methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) strains, which was determined using both classical and massive single-cell microfluidic assays. However, the practical application of Ami is limited by its high cytotoxicity and particularly low stability. The former is associated with its self-lactonization, serving as an improvised intermediate state of Ami hydrolysis. This intramolecular reaction decreases Ami half-life at physiological conditions to less than 2 h, which is unprecedented for a terminal amide. While we speculate that the instability of Ami is essential for <i>Bacillus</i> ecology, we believe that its stable analogs represent attractive lead compounds both for antibiotic discovery and for anticancer drug development.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Bottromycin is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) produced by several streptomycetes, including the plant pathogen <i>Streptomyces scabies</i>. There is significant interest in this molecule as it possesses strong antibacterial activity against clinically relevant multidrug resistant pathogens and is structurally distinct from all other antibiotics. However, studies into its efficacy are hampered by poor yields. An understanding of how bottromycin biosynthesis is regulated could aid the development of strategies to increase titres. Here, we use 5'-tag-RNA-seq to identify the transcriptional organization of the gene cluster, which includes an internal transcriptional start site that precedes <i>btmD</i>, the gene that encodes the bottromycin precursor peptide. We show that the gene cluster does not encode a master regulator that controls pathway expression and instead encodes a regulatory gene, <i>btmL</i>, which functions as a modulator that specifically affects the expression of <i>btmD</i> but not genes up- or downstream of <i>btmD</i>. In order to identify non-cluster associated proteins involved in regulation, proteins were identified that bind to the main promoter of the pathway, which precedes <i>btmC</i>. This study provides insights into how this deceptively complex pathway is regulated in the absence of a pathway specific master regulator, and how it might coordinate with the central metabolism of the cell.",

However, low biosynthesis efficiency is the major obstacle in its commercialization. Here, we used nanoparticles to increase the surfactin production in <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> MT45 through enhancing the secretion (the key step of surfactin biosynthesis). The results showed that the surfactin titer increased from 4.93 to 7.15 g/L in the flask and from 5.94 to 9.18 g/L in a 7 L bioreactor by adding 5 g/L Fe nanoparticles. They were the highest titers in the reported wild-type strain. Our results indicated that Fe nanoparticles enhanced the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of surfactin. Moreover, Fe nanoparticles increased the permeability of cell membranes, resulting in a more efficient secretion of surfactin. This study provides an efficient strategy for increasing the biosynthesis of microbial metabolites and provides new insights into the nanoparticles' impacts on microbes.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Fungi in the genus Cercospora cause crop losses world-wide on many crop species. The wide host range and success of these pathogens has been attributed to the production of a photoactivated toxin, cercosporin. We engineered tobacco for resistance to Cercospora nicotianae utilizing two strategies: 1) transformation with cercosporin autoresistance genes isolated from the fungus, and 2) transformation with constructs to silence the production of cercosporin during disease development. Three C. nicotianae cercosporin autoresistance genes were tested: ATR1 and CFP, encoding an ABC and an MFS transporter, respectively, and 71cR, which encodes a hypothetical protein. Resistance to the pathogen was identified in transgenic lines expressing ATR1 and 71cR, but not in lines transformed with CFP. Silencing of the CTB1 polyketide synthase and to a lesser extent the CTB8 pathway regulator in the cercosporin biosynthetic pathway also led to the recovery of resistant lines. All lines tested expressed the transgenes, and a direct correlation between the level of transgene expression and disease resistance was not identified in any line. Resistance was also not correlated with the degree of silencing in the CTB1 and CTB8 silenced lines. We conclude that expression of fungal cercosporin autoresistance genes as well as silencing of the cercosporin pathway are both effective strategies for engineering resistance to Cercospora diseases where cercosporin plays a critical role.",

The biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides is usually accomplished by the type II polyketide synthases (PKSs), which produce highly diverse polyketide chains by sequential condensation of the starter units with extender units, followed by reduction, cyclization, aromatization and tailoring reactions. Recently, significant progress has been made in characterization and engineering of type II PKSs to produce novel products and improve product titers. In this review, we briefly summarize the architectural organizations and genetic contributions of PKS genes to provide insight into the biosynthetic process. We then review the most recent progress in engineered biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides, with emphasis on generating novel molecular structures. We also discuss the current challenges and future perspectives in the rational engineering of type II PKSs for large scale production of aromatic polyketides.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Organic fertilizer is a major carrier that stores and transmits antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In the environment, due to the application of organic fertilizers in agriculture, the increasing diversity and abundance of ARGs poses a potential threat to human health and environmental safety. In this paper, the microbial community structure and ARGs in different types of organic fertilizer treated with composting were examined. We found that the abundance and diversity of ARGs in earthworm cast organic fertilizer were the lowest and the highest in chicken manure organic fertilizer. Interestingly, the abundance and diversity of ARGs, especially beta-lactam resistance genes, sulfonamide resistance genes, and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance genes, in organic fertilizers were reduced significantly, while composting caused no significant change in mobile genetic elements (MGEs), where antibiotic deactivation and the use of efflux pumps were the two most dominant mechanisms. It was clear that removal of ARGs became more efficient with increasing reduction in the bacterial abundances and diversity of potential ARG hosts, and integron-mediated horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) played an important role in the proliferation of most ARG types. Therefore, the reduction in ARGs was mainly driven by changes in bacterial community composition caused by composting. Furthermore, rather than HGTs, the diversity and abundance of bacterial communities affected by compost physical and chemical properties were the main drivers shaping and altering the abundance and diversity of ARGs, which was indicated by a correlation analysis of these properties, antibiotic residues, microbial community structure, and ARGs. In general, high-temperature composting effectively removed antibiotic residues and ARGs from these organic fertilizers; however, it cannot prevent the proliferation of MGEs. The insights gained from these results may be of assistance in the safe and rational use of organic fertilizers by indicating the changes in microbial community structure and ARGs in different types of organic fertilizer treated with composting.",

Furthermore, it is especially a serious problem in regions where rice is consumed as a staple food. Moreover, CTV is a well-known yellow rice toxin, and outbreaks of beriberi have occurred due to consumption of rice that is contaminated by CTV even in the recent years. Although CTV biosynthetic genes of <i>A. terreus</i> have been described, those of <i>P. citreonigrum</i> remain unclear, which is concerning since <i>P. citreonigrum</i> is the main cause of CTV contamination in rice. In the present study, we determined the draft genome of the <i>P. citreonigrum</i> strain IMI92228 and revealed the presence of all four genes that form a gene cluster and that are homologous to the CTV biosynthesis genes of <i>A. terreus</i>. The expression of these four homologous genes were highly correlated with CTV production, suggesting that they may play an important role in CTV biosynthesis in <i>P. citreonigrum</i>. We concluded that the gene cluster is a CTV biosynthesis cluster of <i>P. citreonigrum</i>.

Mutant strains were created using ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS), N-Methyl-N' nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG), and ultraviolet light (UV) followed by recursive protoplast fusion. After two rounds of shuffling, the mutants Gb2, Gc8, and Gd7 were produced that had an increase in cellulase activity of 128%, 148%, and 167%, respectively, in comparison to the wild type VS15. The genetic diversity of the shuffled strain Gd7 and wild type VS15 was compared at whole genome level. Genomic-level comparisons identified a set of eight genes, consisting of cellulase and regulatory genes, of interest for further analyses. Various genes were identified with insertions and deletions that may be involved in improved celluase production in Gd7.. Strain Gd7 maintained the capability of hydrolyzing wheatbran to glucose and converting glucose to ethanol by fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae of the wild type VS17. This ability was further confirmed by the acidified potassium dichromate (K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) method.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antibiotics are often considered as weapons conferring a competitive advantage to their producers in their ecological niche. However, since these molecules are produced in specific environmental conditions, notably phosphate limitation that triggers a specific metabolic state, they are likely to play important roles in the physiology of the producing bacteria that have been overlooked. Our recent experimental data as well as careful analysis of the scientific literature led us to propose that, in conditions of moderate to severe phosphate limitation-conditions known to generate energetic stress-antibiotics play crucial roles in the regulation of the energetic metabolism of the producing bacteria. A novel classification of antibiotics into types I, II, and III, based on the nature of the targets of these molecules and on their impact on the cellular physiology, is proposed. Type I antibiotics are known to target cellular membranes, inducing energy spilling and cell lysis of a fraction of the population to provide nutrients, and especially phosphate, to the surviving population. Type II antibiotics inhibit respiration through different strategies, to reduce ATP generation in conditions of low phosphate availability. Lastly, Type III antibiotics that are known to inhibit ATP consuming anabolic processes contribute to ATP saving in conditions of phosphate starvation.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Lincomycin, produced by Streptomyces lincolnensis, is a lincosamide antibiotic and widely used for the treatment of the infective diseases caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The mechanisms of lincomycin biosynthesis have been deeply explored in recent years. However, the regulatory effects of LmbU that is a transcriptional regulator in lincomycin biosynthetic (lmb) gene cluster have not been fully addressed.<h4>Results</h4>LmbU was used to search for homologous LmbU (LmbU-like) proteinsÂ in the genomes of actinobacteria, and the results showed that LmbU-like proteins are highly distributed regulators in the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of secondary metabolites or/and out of the BGCs in actinomycetes. The overexpression, inactivation and complementation of the lmbU gene indicated that LmbU positively controls lincomycin biosynthesis in S. lincolnensis. Comparative transcriptomic analysis further revealed that LmbU activates the 28 lmb genes at whole lmb cluster manner. Furthermore, LmbU represses the transcription of the non-lmb gene hpdA in the biosynthesis of L-tyrosine, the precursor of lincomycin. LmbU up-regulates nineteen non-lmb genes, which would be involved in multi-drug flux to self-resistance, nitrate and sugar transmembrane transport and utilization, and redox metabolisms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LmbU is a significant pleiotropic transcriptional regulator in lincomycin biosynthesis by entirely activating the lmb cluster and regulating the non-lmb genes in Streptomyces lincolnensis. Our results first revealed the pleiotropic regulatory function of LmbU, and shed new light on the transcriptional effects of LmbU-like family proteins on antibiotic biosynthesis in actinomycetes.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Overuse and misuse of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance which has become a significant public health concern. <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> is the most common pathogenic bacteria underlying nosocomial infections due to the expression of virulence factors and occurrence of antibiotic resistance. Evidence indicates that Î²-lactamase is involved in the antibiotic resistance of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> to Î²-lactam antibiotics. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the molecular biological mechanisms of antibiotic resistance of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL). In order to assess temporal trends in prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> bacteria were isolated and the ESBL expression level was analyzed. Susceptibility tests were performed using automated systems. The Î²-lactam-resistance in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> was assessed by the Î²-lactam agar screen plate and respective MIC values were evaluated using E-test strips. The confirmatory disk diffusion methods were applied for phenotypic identification of the ESBL production of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. The results showed that <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> bacteria exhibited higher ESBL production after treatment with Î²-lactam compared to the control. The ESBL gene expression was upregulated in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> after treatment with Î²-lactam. Results identified that penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) were associated with the growth and resistance to Î²-lactams. Zinc finger nuclease markedly inhibited the antibiotic resistance of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae to</i> Î²-lactam. PBP knockdown abolished the inhibitory effects of zinc finger nuclease on the growth of <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i> <i>e</i> induced by Î²-lactam antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, these results suggest that the resistance of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> bacteria <i>to</i> antimicrobial drugs is through the ESBL signaling pathway, which indicates that ESBL may be a potential target for abolishing resistance to Î²-lactam.",

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its high-affinity receptor, mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-Met), are closely related to the onset, progression, and metastasis of multiple tumors. The HGF/c-Met axis is involved in cell proliferation, movement, differentiation, invasion, angiogenesis, and apoptosis by activating multiple downstream signaling pathways. In this review, we focus on the function of the HGF/c-Met axis in HCC. The HGF/c-Met axis promotes the onset, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of HCC. Moreover, it can serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a therapeutic target for HCC. In addition, it is closely related to drug resistance during HCC treatment.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Polyether ionophores are antimicrobial compounds used as feed additives in poultry feed to control diseases caused by coccidia. In addition to the anticoccidial activity of these compounds, polyether ionophores also contain antibacterial properties. Resistance to the polyether ionophore narasin was recently shown to exist on mobile plasmids in <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> and the resistance mechanism was suggested to be associated with a two-gene operon encoding an ABC-type transporter. In this study we demonstrate that the genes encoding the putative narasin resistance mechanism confers reduced susceptibility to the polyether ionophores narasin, salinomycin and maduramicin, but not to monensin and suggest that this resistance mechanism should be referred to as NarAB. Importantly, NarAB does not affect the susceptibility of <i>E. faecium</i> to any of the tested antimicrobial compounds that are used in clinical medicine. However, we show that conjugation in the presence of certain polyether ionophores increases the number of vancomycin resistant <i>E. faecium</i> suggesting that narasin and certain other polyether ionophores can contribute to the persistence of VRE in poultry populations.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Despite the important biological activities of natural product naphthoquinones, the biosynthetic pathways of and resistance mechanisms against such compounds remain poorly understood in fungi. Here, we report that the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of <i>Monascus</i> naphthoquinones (monasones) reside within the gene cluster for <i>Monascus</i> azaphilone pigments (MonAzPs). We elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of monasones by a combination of comparative genome analysis, gene knockouts, heterologous coexpression, and <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> enzymatic reactions to show that this pathway branches from the first polyketide intermediate of MonAzPs. Furthermore, we propose that the monasone subset of biosynthetic genes also encodes a two-tiered resistance strategy in which an inducible monasone-specific exporter expels monasones from the mycelia, while residual intracellular monasones may be rendered nontoxic through a multistep reduction cascade.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The genes for <i>Monascus</i> naphthoquinone (monasone) biosynthesis are embedded in and form a composite supercluster with the <i>Monascus</i> azaphilone pigment biosynthetic gene cluster. Early biosynthetic intermediates are shared by the two pathways. Some enzymes encoded by the supercluster play double duty in contributing to both pathways, while others are specific for one or the other pathway. The monasone subcluster is independently regulated and inducible by elicitation with competing microorganisms. This study illustrates genomic and biosynthetic parsimony in fungi and proposes a potential path for the evolution of the mosaic-like azaphilone-naphthoquinone supercluster. The monasone subcluster also encodes a two-tiered self-resistance mechanism that models resistance determinants that may transfer to target microorganisms or emerge in cancer cells in case of naphthoquinone-type cytotoxic agents.",

In this study, a genome-based approach on Streptomyces yeochonensis CN732, a representative neutrotolerant acidophilic streptomycete, was employed to examine the biosynthetic as well as enzymatic potential, and also presence of any genetic tools for adaptation in acidic environment.<h4>Results</h4>A high quality draft genome (7.8âMb) of S. yeochonensis CN732 was obtained with a Gâ+âC content of 73.53% and 6549 protein coding genes. The in silico analysis predicted presence of multiple biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which showed similarity with those for antimicrobial, anticancer or antiparasitic compounds. However, the low levels of similarity with known BGCs for most cases suggested novelty of the metabolites from those predicted gene clusters. The production of various novel metabolites was also confirmed from the combined high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Through comparative genome analysis with related Streptomyces species, genes specific to strain CN732 and also those specific to neutrotolerant acidophilic species could be identified, which showed that genes for metabolism in diverse environment were enriched among acidophilic species. In addition, the presence of strain specific genes for carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZyme) along with many other singletons indicated uniqueness of the genetic makeup of strain CN732. The presence of cysteine transpeptidases (sortases) among the BGCs was also observed from this study, which implies their putative roles in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study highlights the bioactive potential of strain CN732, an acidophilic streptomycete with regard to secondary metabolite production and biodegradation potential using genomics based approach. The comparative genome analysis revealed genes specific to CN732 and also those among acidophilic species, which could give some insights into the adaptation of microbial life in acidic environment.",

Despite an attenuation in the discovery rate of new molecules, the current genomics and transcriptomics revolution has illuminated the untapped biosynthetic potential of many diverse organisms. Today, natural product discovery can be driven by biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) analysis, which is capable of predicting enzymes that catalyze novel reactions and organisms that synthesize new chemical structures. This approach has been particularly effective in mining bacterial and fungal genomes where it has facilitated the discovery of new molecules, increased the understanding of metabolite assembly, and in some instances uncovered enzymes with intriguing synthetic utility. While relatively less is known about the biosynthetic potential of non-fungal eukaryotes, there is compelling evidence to suggest many encode biosynthetic enzymes that produce molecules with unique bioactivities. In this review, we highlight how the advances in genomics and transcriptomics have aided natural product discovery in sources from eukaryotic lineages. We summarize work that has successfully connected genes to previously identified molecules and how advancing these techniques can lead to genetics-guided discovery of novel chemical structures and reactions distributed throughout the tree of life. Ultimately, we discuss the advantage of increasing the known biosynthetic space to ease access to complex natural and non-natural small molecules.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Vancomycin and related glycopeptides are drugs of last resort for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile. Vancomycin was long considered immune to resistance due to its bactericidal activity based on binding to the bacterial cell envelope rather than to a protein target as is the case for most antibiotics. However, two types of complex resistance mechanisms, each comprised of a multi-enzyme pathway, emerged and are now widely disseminated in pathogenic species, thus threatening the clinical efficiency of vancomycin. Vancomycin forms an intricate network of hydrogen bonds with the d-Ala-d-Ala region of Lipid II, interfering with the peptidoglycan layer maturation process. Resistance to vancomycin involves degradation of this natural precursor and its replacement with d-Ala-d-lac or d-Ala-d-Ser alternatives to which vancomycin has low affinity. Through extensive research over 30âyears after the initial discovery of vancomycin resistance, remarkable progress has been made in molecular understanding of the enzymatic cascades responsible. Progress has been driven by structural studies of the key components of the resistance mechanisms which provided important molecular understanding such as, for example, the ability of this cascade to discriminate between vancomycin sensitive and resistant peptidoglycan precursors. Important structural insights have been also made into the molecular evolution of vancomycin resistance enzymes. Altogether this molecular data can accelerate inhibitor discovery and optimization efforts to reverse vancomycin resistance. Here, we overview our current understanding of this complex resistance mechanism with a focus on the structural and molecular aspects.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Genome sequencing has revealed that <i>Nonomuraea</i> spp. represent a still largely unexplored source of specialized metabolites. <i>Nonomuraea gerenzanensis</i> ATCC 39727 is the most studied representative species since it produces the glycopeptide antibiotic (GPA) A40926 - the precursor of the clinically relevant antibiotic dalbavancin, approved by the FDA in 2014 for the treatment of acute skin infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The clinical relevance of dalbavancin has prompted increased attention on A40926 biosynthesis and its regulation. In this paper, we investigated how to enhance the genetic toolkit for members of the <i>Nonomuraea</i> genus, which have proved quite recalcitrant to genetic manipulation. By constructing promoter-probe vectors, we tested the activity of 11 promoters (heterologous and native) using the GusA reporter system in <i>N. gerenzanensis</i> and in <i>Nonomuraea coxensis</i>; this latter species is phylogenetically distant from <i>N. gerenzanesis</i> and also possesses the genetic potential to produce A40926 or a very similar GPA. Finally, the strongest constitutive promoter analyzed in this study, <i>aac(3)IVp</i>, was used to overexpress the cluster-situated regulatory genes controlling A40926 biosynthesis (<i>dbv3</i> and <i>dbv4</i> from <i>N. gerenzanensis</i> and <i>nocRI</i> from <i>N. coxensis</i>) in <i>N</i>. <i>gerenzanensis</i>, and the growth and productivity of the best performing strains were assessed at bioreactor scale using an industrial production medium. Overexpression of positive pathway-specific regulatory genes resulted in a significant increase in the level of A40926 production in <i>N. gerenzanensis</i>, providing a new knowledge-based approach to strain improvement for this valuable glycopeptide antibiotic.",

Here, the metabolome was evaluated to determine the response of <i>P. ostreatus</i> mycelia to heat stress at different times (6, 12, 24, 48 h). More than 70 differential metabolites were detected and enriched in their metabolic pathways. Dynamic metabolites changes in enrichment pathways under heat stress showed that heat stress enhanced the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids and nucleotides, increased the content of amino acids and vitamins, and accelerated glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in <i>P. ostreatus</i>. The time course changes of <i>P. ostreatus</i> metabolites under continuous heat stress demonstrated that amino acids continuously changed with heat stress, nucleotides clearly changed with heat stress at 12 and 48 h, and lipids exhibited an increasing trend with prolonged heat stress, while few types saccharides and vitamins changed under heat stress. Additionally, heat-treated <i>P. ostreatus</i> produced salicylic acid and other stress-resistant substances that were reported in plants. This study first reported the metabolites changes in <i>P. ostreatus</i> mycelia during 48 h of heat stress. The metabolic pathways and substances that changed with heat stress in this research will aid future studies on the resistance of <i>P. ostreatus</i> and other edible fungi to heat stress.",

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology showed that a total of 1419 OTUs (46.6%) were parental lines unique and 1052 OTUs (34.5%) were hybrid varieties unique, with only 575 core OTUs revealed in all the samples. Most OTUs belonged to <i>Proteobacteria</i>. <i>Enterobacter</i> (23.2%), <i>Shigella</i> (21.2%), <i>Pseudomonas</i> (15.8%) and <i>Achromobacter</i> (10.1%) were the major genera; the bacterial community composition and diversity of endophytic bacteria were inconsistent among different seed genotypes. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), the results referred that the endophytic composition of hybrid sample showed obvious correlation with their female parental lines, and in 'Jingke968' and 'MC738' with the same female line the endophytic community was more similar than other hybrid samples. This was the first ever use of HTS technology for investigating the endophytic bacterial diversity and community structures in seeds of genetically related maize genotypes, it was shown that, there were core microbes shared among all genotypes of seed samples, and the female parental line was more significant to impact on the composition of their hybrid seeds than male parental line. This study would provide scientific clues for the future research on the vertical transmission of endophytes among maize generations.",

However, Streptomyces sahachiroi, the strain that produces AZB, seems almost impervious to this danger because of its diverse and distinctive self-protection machineries. Here, we report the identification of a novel endonuclease-like gene aziN that contributes to drug self-protection in S. sahachiroi. AziN expression conferred AZB resistance on native and heterologous host strains. The specific binding reaction between AziN and AZB was also verified in accordance with its homology to drug binding proteins, but no drug sequestering and deactivating effects could be detected. Intriguingly, due to the high affinity with the drug, AziN was discovered to exhibit specific recognition and binding capacity with AZB-mediated ICL structures, further inducing DNA strand breakage. Subsequent in vitro assays demonstrated the structure-specific endonuclease activity of AziN, which cuts both damaged strands at specific sites around AZB-ICLs. Unravelling the nuclease activity of AziN provides a good entrance point to illuminate the complex mechanisms of AZB-ICL repair.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Streptomyces</i> is taken as an important resource for producing the most abundant antibiotics and other bio-active natural products, which have been widely used in pharmaceutical and agricultural areas. Usually they are biosynthesized through secondary metabolic pathways encoded by cluster situated genes. And these gene clusters are stringently regulated by interweaved transcriptional regulatory cascades. In the past decades, great advances have been made to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved in antibiotic production in <i>Streptomyces</i>. In this review, we summarized the recent advances on the regulatory cascades of antibiotic production in <i>Streptomyces</i> from the following four levels: the signals triggering the biosynthesis, the global regulators, the pathway-specific regulators and the feedback regulation. The production of antibiotic can be largely enhanced by rewiring the regulatory networks, such as overexpression of positive regulators, inactivation of repressors, fine-tuning of the feedback and ribosomal engineering in <i>Streptomyces</i>. The enormous amount of genomic sequencing data implies that the <i>Streptomyces</i> has potential to produce much more antibiotics for the great diversities and wide distributions of biosynthetic gene clusters in <i>Streptomyces</i> genomes. Most of these gene clusters are defined cryptic for unknown or undetectable natural products. In the synthetic biology era, activation of the cryptic gene clusters has been successfully achieved by manipulation of the regulatory genes. Chemical elicitors, rewiring regulatory gene and ribosomal engineering have been employed to crack the potential of cryptic gene clusters. These have been proposed as the most promising strategy to discover new antibiotics. For the complex of regulatory network in <i>Streptomyces</i>, we proposed that the discovery of new antibiotics and the optimization of industrial strains would be greatly promoted by further understanding the regulatory mechanism of antibiotic production.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Zinc performs diverse physiological functions, and virtually all living organisms require zinc as an essential trace element. To identify the detailed function of zinc in fungal pathogenicity, we carried out cDNA microarray analysis using the model system of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, a fungal pathogen. From microarray analysis, we found that the genes involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis were upregulated when zinc was depleted, and the microarray data were confirmed by northern blot analysis. In particular, zinc deficiency upregulated the expression of <i>GliZ</i>, which encodes a Zn2-Cys6 binuclear transcription factor that regulates the expression of the genes required for gliotoxin biosynthesis. The production of gliotoxin was decreased in a manner inversely proportional to the zinc concentration, and the same result was investigated in the absence of <i>ZafA</i>, which is a zinc-dependent transcription activator. Interestingly, we found two conserved ZafA-binding motifs, 5'-CAAGGT-3', in the upstream region of <i>GliZ</i> on the genome and discovered that deletion of the <i>ZafA</i>-binding motifs resulted in loss of ZafA-binding activity; gliotoxin production was decreased dramatically, as demonstrated with a <i>GliZ</i> deletion mutant. Furthermore, mutation of the ZafA-binding motifs resulted in an increase in the conidial killing activity of human macrophage and neutrophil cells, and virulence was decreased in a murine model. Finally, transcriptomic analysis revealed that the expression of <i>ZafA</i> and <i>GliZ</i> was upregulated during phagocytosis by macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that zinc plays an important role in the pathogenicity of <i>A. fumigatus</i> by regulating gliotoxin production during the phagocytosis pathway to overcome the host defense system.",

Unexpectedly this results in a C2 stereoisomer of mithramycin, iso-mithramycin (iso-MTM). Iso-MTM undergoes a non-enzymatic isomerization to MTM catalyzed by Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Crystal structures of MtmW and its complexes with co-substrate NADPH and PEG, suggest a catalytic mechanism of MtmW. The structures also show that a tetrameric assembly of this enzyme strikingly resembles the ring-shaped Î² subunit of a vertebrate ion channel. We show that MtmW and MtmOIV form a complex in the presence of PMB and NADPH, presumably to hand over the unstable MtmOIV product to MtmW, yielding iso-MTM, as a potential self-resistance mechanism against MTM toxicity.",

MPA is produced by the filamentous fungi Penicillium brevicompactum, which contains two IMPDHs, PbIMPDHA and PbIMPDHB, both of which are MPA-resistant. The MPA binding sites of these enzymes are identical to MPA-sensitive IMPDHs, so the structural determinants of resistance are unknown. Here we show that a single residue, Ser267, accounts for the MPA resistance of PbIMPDHA. Substitution of Ser267 with Ala, the residue most commonly found in this position in eukaryotic IMPDHs, makes PbIMPDHA sensitive to MPA. Conversely, Aspergillus nidulans IMPDH becomes MPA-resistant when the analogous Ala residue is substituted with Ser. These substitutions have little effect on the catalytic cycles of either enzyme, suggesting the fitness costs are negligible despite the strong conservation of Ala at this position. Intriguingly, while only 1% of fungal IMPDHs contain Ser or Thr at position 267, these residues are found in the IMPDHs from several Aspergillus species that grow at the low temperatures also favored by Penicillium. Perhaps Ser/Thr267 is an evolutionary signature of MPA exposure.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Aging is a universal property of multicellular organisms. Although some tree species can live for centuries or millennia, the molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying their longevity are unclear. To address this, we investigated age-related changes in the vascular cambium from 15- to 667-y-old <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> trees. The ring width decreased sharply during the first 100 to 200 y, with only a slight change after 200 y of age, accompanied by decreasing numbers of cambial cell layers. In contrast, average basal area increment (BAI) continuously increased with aging, showing that the lateral meristem can retain indeterminacy in old trees. The indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentration in cambial cells decreased with age, whereas the content of abscisic acid (ABA) increased significantly. In addition, cell division-, cell expansion-, and differentiation-related genes exhibited significantly lower expression in old trees, especially miR166 and HD-ZIP III interaction networks involved in cambial activity. Disease resistance-associated genes retained high expression in old trees, along with genes associated with synthesis of preformed protective secondary metabolites. Comprehensive evaluation of the expression of genes related to autophagy, senescence, and age-related miRNAs, together with analysis of leaf photosynthetic efficiencies and seed germination rates, demonstrated that the old trees are still in a healthy, mature state, and senescence is not manifested at the whole-plant level. Taken together, our results reveal that long-lived trees have evolved compensatory mechanisms to maintain a balance between growth and aging processes. This involves continued cambial divisions, high expression of resistance-associated genes, and continued synthetic capacity of preformed protective secondary metabolites.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Actinomycetes are remarkable producers of compounds essential for human and veterinary medicine as well as for agriculture. The genomes of those microorganisms possess several sets of genes (biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC)) encoding pathways for the production of the valuable secondary metabolites. A significant proportion of the identified BGCs in actinomycetes encode pathways for the biosynthesis of polyketide compounds, nonribosomal peptides, or hybrid products resulting from the combination of both polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The potency of these molecules, in terms of bioactivity, was recognized in the 1940s, and started the \"Golden Age\" of antimicrobial drug discovery. Since then, several valuable polyketide drugs, such as erythromycin A, tylosin, monensin A, rifamycin, tetracyclines, amphotericin B, and many others were isolated from actinomycetes. This review covers the most relevant actinomycetes-derived polyketide drugs with antimicrobial activity, including anti-fungal agents. We provide an overview of the source of the compounds, structure of the molecules, the biosynthetic principle, bioactivity and mechanisms of action, and the current stage of development. This review emphasizes the importance of actinomycetes-derived antimicrobial polyketides and should serve as a \"lexicon\", not only to scientists from the Natural Products field, but also to clinicians and others interested in this topic.",

We were unable to elicit production of fosmidomycin, instead observing the unsaturated derivative dehydrofosmidomycin, which we showed potently inhibits 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase and has bioactivity against a number of bacteria. The genes required for dehydrofosmidomycin biosynthesis were established by heterologous expression experiments. Bioinformatics analyses, characterization of intermediates and in vitro biochemistry show that the biosynthetic pathway involves conversion of a two-carbon phosphonate precursor into the unsaturated three-carbon product via a highly unusual rearrangement reaction, catalyzed by the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase DfmD. The required genes and biosynthetic pathway for dehydrofosmidomycin differ substantially from that of the related natural product FR-900098, suggesting that the ability to produce these bioactive molecules arose via convergent evolution.",

Such structural features are generated by biosynthetic enzymes that construct core scaffolds or perform peripheral modifications, and can thus define natural product families, introduce pharmacophores and permit metabolic diversification. Modern genomics approaches have greatly enhanced our ability to access and characterize natural product pathways via sequence-similarity-based bioinformatics discovery strategies. However, many biosynthetic enzymes catalyse exceptional, unprecedented transformations that continue to defy functional prediction and remain hidden from us in bacterial (meta)genomic sequence data. In this Review, we highlight exciting examples of unusual enzymology that have been uncovered recently in the context of natural product biosynthesis. These suggest that much of the natural product diversity, including entire substance classes, awaits discovery. New approaches to lift the veil on the cryptic chemistries of the natural product universe are also discussed.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Rhizocticins are phosphono-oligopeptide antibiotics that contain a toxic C-terminal ( Z) -l -2-amino-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (APPA) moiety. APPA is an irreversible inhibitor of threonine synthase (ThrC), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of O-phospho-l-homoserine to l-threonine. ThrCs are essential for the viability of bacteria, plants, and fungi and are a target for antibiotic development, as de novo threonine biosynthetic pathway is not found in humans. Given the ability of APPA to interfere in threonine metabolism, it is unclear how the producing strain B. subtilis ATCC 6633 circumvents APPA toxicity. Notably, in addition to the housekeeping APPA-sensitive ThrC ( BsThrC), B. subtilis encodes a second threonine synthase (RhiB) encoded within the rhizocticin biosynthetic gene cluster. Kinetic and spectroscopic analyses show that PLP-dependent RhiB is an authentic threonine synthase, converting O-phospho-l-homoserine to threonine with a catalytic efficiency comparable to BsThrC. To understand the structural basis of inhibition, we determined the crystal structure of APPA bound to the housekeeping BsThrC, revealing a covalent complex between the inhibitor and PLP. Structure-based sequence analyses reveal structural determinants within the RhiB active site that contribute to rendering this ThrC homologue resistant to APPA. Together, this work establishes the self-resistance mechanism utilized by B. subtilis ATCC 6633 against APPA exemplifying one of many ways by which bacteria can overcome phosphonate toxicity.",

Genetic inactivation of retS enhanced the production of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, which contributed for the enhanced antifungal activity. Then, the entire nitrogenase island with native promoter from Pseudomonas stutzeri DSM4166 was introduced into a retS mutant strain for expression. Root colonization patterns assessed via confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that GFP-tagged bacterial were mainly located on root surfaces and at the junctions between epidermal root cells. Moreover, under pathogen and N-limited double treatment conditions, the fresh weights of seedlings inoculated with the recombinant retS mutant-nif strain were increased compared with those of the control.

Aimed at generating analogues by metabolic engineering, the valinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned from Streptomyces tsusimaensis ATCC 15141. Targeted disruption of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene abolishes valinomycin production, which confirms its predicted nonribosomal-peptide origin. Sequence analysis of the NRPS system reveals four distinctive modules, two of which contain unusual domain organizations that are presumably involved in the generation of biosynthetic precursors D-alpha-hydroxyisovaleric acid and L-lactic acid. The respective adenylation domains in these two modules contain novel substrate-specificity-conferring codes that might specify for a class of hydroxyl acids for the biosynthesis of the depsipeptide natural products.",

The results indicated that the abundances of the detected ARGs ranged from 3.6 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> to 1.13 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> copies/g. The ARGs with the highest abundance was <i>sul2</i>, and the lowest was <i>blaCTX</i>. Composting removes most of the ARGs and MGEs by 22.8-99.7%. These ARGs were significantly reduced during the thermophilic phase of compost. The removal rate of ARGs at the different layers of compost pile was different as follows: middle layer > upper layer > lower layer. But some ARGs proliferated significantly in the maturation phase of compost, especially the sulfonamide resistance genes. Compound microbial inoculants increased the temperature of compost, accelerated water loss, nitrogen fixation, and increased the removal rate of Î²-lactamase resistance genes, the transposon gene <i>tn916</i> and part of tetracycline resistance genes by 3.7-23.8% in compost. Compound microbial inoculants changed the community structure and increased the <i>Bacillus</i> abundance in the thermophilic phase of compost. And it was helpful for removing pathogens during composting. The addition of compound microbial inoculants causes the decrease of <i>Firmicutes</i> and the increase of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, which may be related to the removal and proliferation of ARGs.",

Development of microbial confrontation is a severe rising risk to global community well-being as treatment in addition, management of such resistant microbial infections is difficult and challenging. The situation requires action across all government sectors and society. The change in the molecular target on which antimicrobial drugs act is one of the key mechanisms behind AMR. One of the approaches to battle with AMR can be exploring newer molecular targets in microbes and discovering new molecules accordingly. There are various examples of novel targets such as biomolecules involving in biosynthesis of cell wall, biosynthesis of aromatic amino acid, cell disunion, biosynthesis of fatty acid, and isoprenoid biosynthesis and tRNA synthetases. Fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB) and their enzymes among all the above is the more appealing target for the advancement of new antimicrobial agents. Number of promising inhibitors have been developed for bacterial fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and also few of them are clinically used. Some of these potential inhibitors are found to be used in development of new antibacterial as a lead compound and have been discovered from high throughput screening processes like Platencimycin and their analogue, Platencin. The review majorly encompasses bacterial FAB in type II FAS system and potential inhibitors with respective targets of novel antibacterial.",

Salinosporamide A discovered as a self-resistance product from the marine bacterium <i>Salinospora tropica</i>, has been used as a potent proteasome inhibitor (PI). Although PIs have been developed as novel therapeutics for autoimmune diseases, due to their immunosuppressive effect, whether salinosporamide A inhibits T cell activation remains unknown. The current study finds that salinosporamide A is not cytotoxic, but controls T cell proliferation. Results from our cell cycle arrest analysis revealed that salinosporamide A leads to cell cycle arrest and regulates the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases. Under activated conditions, salinosporamide A abrogated T cell activation by T cell receptor-mediated stimulation, in which the production of cytokines was inhibited by pretreatment with salinosporamide A. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the regulation of T cell activation by salinosporamide A is mediated by suppressing the MAPK pathway. Therefore, our results suggest that salinosporamide A effectively suppresses T cell activation through regulating T cell proliferation and the cell cycle and provides great insight into the development of novel therapeutics for autoimmune diseases or graft-versus-host disease.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antimicrobials against bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens have transformed human and animal health. Nevertheless, their widespread use (and misuse) has led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which poses a potentially catastrophic threat to public health and animal husbandry. There are several routes, both intrinsic and acquired, by which AMR can develop. One major route is through non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in coding regions. Large scale genomic studies using high-throughput sequencing data have provided powerful new ways to rapidly detect and respond to such genetic mutations linked to AMR. However, these studies are limited in their mechanistic insight. Computational tools can rapidly and inexpensively evaluate the effect of mutations on protein function and evolution. Subsequent insights can then inform experimental studies, and direct existing or new computational methods. Here we review a range of sequence and structure-based computational tools, focussing on tools successfully used to investigate mutational effect on drug targets in clinically important pathogens, particularly <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Combining genomic results with the biophysical effects of mutations can help reveal the molecular basis and consequences of resistance development. Furthermore, we summarise how the application of such a mechanistic understanding of drug resistance can be applied to limit the impact of AMR.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The global shrimp industry has suffered bacterial diseases caused mainly by <i>Vibrio</i> species. The typical vibriosis, acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), has resulted in mass mortality and devastating economic losses. Thus, therapeutic strategies are highly needed to decrease the risk of vibriosis outbreaks. Herein, we initially identified that the growth of the causative agent of AHPND, <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> (VP <sub><i>AHPND</i></sub> ) and other vibrios in Pacific white shrimp (<i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>) was inhibited by a <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> strain BSXE-1601. The natural products amicoumacins A, B, and C were purified from the cell-free supernatant from the strain BSXE-1601, but only amicoumacin A was demonstrated to be responsible for this anti-<i>Vibrio</i> activity. Our discovery provided the first evidence that amicoumacin A was highly active against shrimp pathogens, including the representative strain VP <sub><i>AHPND</i></sub> . Furthermore, we elucidated the amicoumacin A biosynthetic gene cluster by whole genome sequencing of the <i>B. subtilis</i> strain BSXE-1601. In addition to amicoumacin A, the strain BSXE-1601 genome harbored other genes encoding bacillibactin, fengycin, surfactin, bacilysin, and subtilosin A, all of which have previously reported antagonistic activities against pathogenic strains. The whole-genome analysis provided unequivocal evidence in support of the huge potential of the strain BSXE-1601 to produce diverse biologically antagonistic natural products, which may facilitate further studies on the effective therapeutics for detrimental diseases in shrimp.",

In this study, the genome sequences of 11 <i>Streptacidiphilus</i> species were subjected to the comparative analysis together with selected <i>Streptomyces</i> and <i>Kitasatospora</i> genomes. This study represents the first comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of the genus <i>Streptacidiphilus</i>. The results indicate that the genomes of <i>Streptacidiphilus</i> contained various secondary metabolite (SM) producing biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), some of them exclusively identified in <i>Streptacidiphilus</i> only. Several of these clusters may potentially code for SMs that may have a broad range of bioactivities, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial and antitumor activities. The biodegradation capabilities of <i>Streptacidiphilus</i> were also explored by investigating the hydrolytic enzymes for complex carbohydrates. Although all genomes were enriched with carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), their numbers in the genomes of some strains such as Streptacidiphilus carbonis NBRC 100919<sup>T</sup> were higher as compared to well-known carbohydrate degrading organisms.

Primycin is a large 36-membered non-polyene macrolide lactone exclusively produced by Saccharomonospora azurea. This study provides information about strain dependent primycin production ability in conjunction with the structural, functional and comparative genomic examinations. Comparison of high- and low-primycin producer strains, transcriptomic analysis identified a total of 686 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), classified into diverse Cluster of Orthologous Groups. Among them, genes related to fatty acid synthesis, self-resistance, regulation of secondary metabolism and agmatinase encoding gene responsible for catalyze conversion between guanidino/amino forms of primycin were discussed. Based on in silico data mining methods, we were able to identify DEGs whose altered expression provide a good starting point for the optimization of fermentation processes, in order to perform targeted strain improvement and rational drug design.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The reassessment of known but neglected natural compounds is a vital strategy for providing novel lead structures urgently needed to overcome antimicrobial resistance. Scaffolds with resistance-breaking properties represent the most promising candidates for a successful translation into future therapeutics. Our study focuses on chelocardin, a member of the atypical tetracyclines, and its bioengineered derivative amidochelocardin, both showing broad-spectrum antibacterial activity within the ESKAPE (<i>Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Enterobacter</i> species) panel. Further lead development of chelocardins requires extensive biological and chemical profiling to achieve favorable pharmaceutical properties and efficacy. This study shows that both molecules possess resistance-breaking properties enabling the escape from most common tetracycline resistance mechanisms. Further, we show that these compounds are potent candidates for treatment of urinary tract infections due to their in vitro activity against a large panel of multidrug-resistant uropathogenic clinical isolates. In addition, the mechanism of resistance to natural chelocardin was identified as relying on efflux processes, both in the chelocardin producer <i>Amycolatopsis sulphurea</i> and in the pathogen <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae.</i> Resistance development in <i>Klebsiella</i> led primarily to mutations in <i>ramR</i>, causing increased expression of the <i>acrAB-tolC</i> efflux pump. Most importantly, amidochelocardin overcomes this resistance mechanism, revealing not only the improved activity profile but also superior resistance-breaking properties of this novel antibacterial compound.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Screening microbial cultures for specialised metabolites is essential for the discovery of new biologically active compounds. A novel, cost-effective and rapid screening method is described for extracting specialised metabolites from bacteria grown on agar plates, coupled with HPLC for basic identification of known and potentially novel metabolites. The method allows the screening of culture collections to identify optimal production strains and metabolite induction conditions. The protocol was optimised on two Burkholderia species known to produce the antibiotics, enacyloxin IIa (B. ambifaria) and gladiolin (B. gladioli), respectively; it was then applied to strains of each species to identify high antibiotic producers. B. ambifaria AMMD and B. gladioli BCC0238 produced the highest concentrations of the respective antibiotic under the conditions tested. To induce expression of silent biosynthetic gene clusters, the addition of low concentrations of antibiotics to growth media was evaluated as known elicitors of Burkholderia specialised metabolites. Subinhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim and other clinically therapeutic antibiotics were evaluated and screened against a panel of B. gladioli and B. ambifaria. To enhance rapid strain screening with more antibiotic elicitors, antimicrobial susceptibility testing discs were included within the induction medium. Low concentrations of trimethoprim suppressed the production of specialised metabolites in B. gladioli, including the toxins, toxoflavin and bongkrekic acid. However, the addition of trimethoprim significantly improved enacylocin IIa concentrations in B. ambifaria AMMD. Rifampicin and ceftazidime significantly improved the yield of gladiolin and caryoynencin by B. gladioli BCC0238, respectively, and cepacin increased 2-fold with tobramycin in B. ambifaria BCC0191. Potentially novel metabolites were also induced by subinhibitory concentrations of tobramycin and chloramphenicol in B. ambifaria. In contrast to previous findings that low concentrations of antibiotic elicit Burkholderia metabolite production, we found they acted as both inducers or suppressors dependent on the metabolite and the strains producing them. In conclusion, the screening protocol enabled rapid characterization of Burkholderia metabolites, the identification of suitable producer strains, potentially novel natural products and an understanding of metabolite regulation in the presence of inducing or suppressing conditions.",

Tetromadurin is closely related to the polyether tetronates tetronasin (M139603) and tetronomycin, all of which are characterised by containing a tetronate, cyclohexane, tetrahydropyran, and at least one tetrahydrofuran ring. We have sequenced the genome of Actinomadura verrucosospora to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for tetromadurin biosynthesis (the mad gene cluster). Based on bioinformatic analysis of the 32 genes present within the cluster a plausible biosynthetic pathway for tetromadurin biosynthesis is proposed. Functional confirmation of the mad gene cluster is obtained by performing in-frame deletions in each of the genes mad10 and mad31, which encode putative cyclase enzymes responsible for cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran formation, respectively. Furthermore, the A. verrucosospora Îmad10 mutant produces a novel tetromadurin metabolite that according to mass spectrometry analysis is analogous to the recently characterised partially cyclised tetronasin intermediate lacking its cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings. Our results therefore elucidate the biosynthetic machinery of tetromadurin biosynthesis and lend support for a conserved mechanism of cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran biosynthesis across polyether tetronates.",

Advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools have accelerated the exploration of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding natural products. Herein, the completed BGCs of dnacin B1 were first discovered in two <i>Actinosynnema pretiosum</i> subsp. <i>auranticum</i> strains DSM 44131<sup>T</sup> (hereafter abbreviated as strain DSM 44131<sup>T</sup>) and X47 by comparative genome mining strategy. The BGC for dnacin B1 contains 41 ORFs and spans a 66.9 kb DNA region in strain DSM 44131<sup>T</sup>. Its involvement in dnacin B1 biosynthesis was identified through the deletion of a 9.7 kb region. Based on the functional gene analysis, we proposed the biosynthetic pathway for dnacin B1. Moreover, <i>p</i>-amino-phenylalanine (PAPA) unit was found to be the dnacin B1 precursor for the quinone moiety formation, and this was confirmed by heterologous expression of <i>dinV</i>, <i>dinE</i> and <i>dinF</i> in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Furthermore, nine potential PAPA aminotransferases (APAT) from the genome of strain DSM 44131<sup>T</sup> were explored and expressed. Biochemical evaluation of their amino group transformation ability was carried out with <i>p</i>-amino-phenylpyruvic acid (PAPP) or PAPA as the substrate for the final product formation. Two of those, APAT4 and APAT9, displayed intriguing aminotransferase ability for the formation of PAPA. The proposed dnacin B1 biosynthetic machinery and PAPA biosynthetic investigations not only enriched the knowledge of tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) biosynthesis, but also provided PAPA building blocks to generate their structurally unique homologues.",

MraY<sub>AA</sub> in the presence of the MD2 ligand has been crystallized and released, while the interactions between the ligand and active-site residues remain less quantitatively and qualitatively defined. We characterized theoretically the key residues involved in noncovalent interactions with MD2 in the MraY<sub>AA</sub> active site. We applied the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital analyses based on the density functional theory method on the solved crystal structure of MraY with the MD2 to quantitatively estimate the intermolecular interactions. The obtained results revealed the presence of multiple hydrogen bonds in the investigated active site with strength ranging from van der Waals to covalent limits. Lys70, Asp193, Gly194, Asp196, Gly264, Ala321, Gln305, and His325 are key active-site residues interacting with MD2. Conventional and unconventional hydrogen bonds in addition with charge-dipole and dipole-dipole interactions contribute significantly to stabilize the MD2 binding to the MraY<sub>AA</sub> active site. It was also found that water molecules inside the active site have substantial effects on its structure stability through hydrogen-bonding interactions with MD2 and the interacting residues.",

Compared to distilled water administration, JMT reversed decreases in mechanical withdraw threshold and intraepidermal nerve fiber density, improved neurological morphology of sciatic nerves, increased serum neuregulin 1 (NRG1) level and contactin-associated protein (Caspr)-positive paranodes, and decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation in DPN rats. More importantly, JMT enriched nine species of the gut microbiota of DPN rats, helping to prevent dysbiosis. Among these species, p_Actinobacteria, p_Proteobacteria and c_<i>Actinobacteria</i> were negatively correlated with DPN phenotypes and positively correlated with serum NRG1 level.

        "pmc_abstract": "A primary virulence-associated trait of the opportunistic fungal pathogen <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is the production of melanin pigments that are deposited into the cell wall and interfere with the host immune response. Previously, our solid-state NMR studies of isolated melanized cell walls (melanin \"ghosts\") revealed that the pigments are strongly associated with lipids, but their identities, origins, and potential roles were undetermined. Herein, we exploited spectral editing techniques to identify and quantify the lipid molecules associated with pigments in melanin ghosts. The lipid profiles were remarkably similar in whole <i>C. neoformans</i> cells, grown under either melanizing or nonmelanizing conditions; triglycerides (TGs), sterol esters (SEs), and polyisoprenoids (PPs) were the major constituents. Although no quantitative differences were found between melanized and nonmelanized cells, melanin ghosts were relatively enriched in SEs and PPs. In contrast to lipid structures reported during early stages of fungal growth in nutrient-rich media, variants found herein could be linked to nutrient stress, cell aging, and subsequent production of substances that promote chronic fungal infections. The fact that TGs and SEs are the typical cargo of lipid droplets suggests that these organelles could be connected to <i>C. neoformans</i> melanin synthesis. Moreover, the discovery of PPs is intriguing because dolichol is a well-established constituent of human neuromelanin. The presence of these lipid species even in nonmelanized cells suggests that they could be produced constitutively under stress conditions in anticipation of melanin synthesis. These findings demonstrate that <i>C. neoformans</i> lipids are more varied compositionally and functionally than previously recognized.",

Methods for producing bacteriocins have been studied. It is known that bacteriocins, most successfully used today are products of secondary metabolism of lactic acid bacteria. It is established that the main method of bacteriocin research is PCR analysis, which makes it possible to quickly and easily identify the presence of bacteriocin encoding genes. The mechanism of cytotoxic action of bacteriocins has been studied. It is proved that the study of cytotoxic (antitumor) activity in laboratory conditions will lead to the clinical use of bacteriocins for cancer treatment in the near future. It is established that the incorporation of bacteriocins into nanoparticles and targeted delivery to areas of infection may soon become an effective treatment method. The delivery of bacteriocins in a concentrated form, such as encapsulated in nanoparticles, will increase their effectiveness and minimize potential toxic side effects. The analysis of publications on this topic confirmed that diverse research on bacteriocins is relevant.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Advances in genome sequencing have revitalized natural product discovery efforts, revealing the untapped biosynthetic potential of fungi. While the volume of genomic data continues to expand, discovery efforts are slowed due to the time-consuming nature of experiments required to characterize new molecules. To direct efforts toward uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters most likely to encode novel chemical scaffolds, we took advantage of comparative metabolomics and heterologous gene expression using fungal artificial chromosomes (FACs). By linking mass spectral profiles with structural clues provided by FAC-encoded gene clusters, we targeted a compound originating from an unusual gene cluster containing an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). With this approach, we isolate and characterize <i>R</i> and <i>S</i> forms of the new molecule terreazepine, which contains a novel chemical scaffold resulting from cyclization of the IDO-supplied kynurenine. The discovery of terreazepine illustrates that FAC-based approaches targeting unusual biosynthetic machinery provide a promising avenue forward for targeted discovery of novel scaffolds and their biosynthetic enzymes, and it also represents another example of a biosynthetic gene cluster \"repurposing\" a primary metabolic enzyme to diversify its secondary metabolite arsenal.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Here, we provide evidence that <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> encodes a biosynthetic gene cluster containing a repurposed indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) dedicated to secondary metabolite synthesis. The discovery of this neofunctionalized IDO not only enabled discovery of a new compound with an unusual chemical scaffold but also provided insight into the numerous strategies fungi employ for diversifying and protecting themselves against secondary metabolites. The observations in this study set the stage for further in-depth studies into the function of duplicated IDOs present in fungal biosynthetic gene clusters and presents a strategy for accessing the biosynthetic potential of gene clusters containing duplicated primary metabolic genes.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The carriage of both, heavy metal and antibiotic resistance appears to be a common trait in bacterial communities native to long-term contaminated habitats, including the Savannah River Site (SRS). There is widespread soil contamination at the SRS; a United States Department of Energy (DOE) facility with long-term contamination from past industrial and nuclear weapons production activities. To further evaluate the genomic and metabolic traits that underpin metal and antibiotic resistance, a robust mercury (Hg) and uranium (U)-resistant strain- SRS-8-S-2018, was isolated. Minimum inhibitory concentration of this strain revealed resistance to Hg (10 Î¼g/ml) and U (5 mM), the two main heavy metal contaminants at the SRS. Metabolic assessment of strain SRS-8-S-2018 using Biolog metabolic fingerprinting analysis revealed preference for carbohydrate utilization followed by polymers, amino acids, carboxy acids, and esters; this physiological activity diminished when Hg stress was provided at 1 and 3 Î¼g/ml and completely ceased at 5 Î¼g/ml Hg, indicating that continued release of Hg will have negative metabolic impacts to even those microorganisms that possess high resistance ability. Development of antibiotic resistance in strain SRS-8-S-2018 was evaluated at a functional level using phenomics, which confirmed broad resistance against 70.8% of the 48 antibiotics tested. Evolutionary and adaptive traits of strain SRS-8-S-2018 were further assessed using genomics, which revealed the strain to taxonomically affiliate with <i>Serratia marcescens</i> species, possessing a genome size of 5,323,630 bp, 5,261 proteins (CDS), 55 genes for transfer RNA (tRNA), and an average G + C content of 59.48. Comparative genomics with closest taxonomic relatives revealed 360 distinct genes in SRS-8-S-2018, with multiple functions related to both, antibiotic and heavy metal resistance, which likely facilitates the strain's survival in a metalliferous soil habitat. Comparisons drawn between the environmentally isolated <i>Serratia</i> SRS-8-S-2018 with 31 other strains revealed a closer functional association with medically relevant isolates suggesting that propensity of environmental <i>Serratia</i> isolates in acquiring virulence traits, as a function of long-term exposure to heavy metals, which is facilitating development, recruitment and proliferation of not only metal resistant genes (MRGs) but antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), which can potentially trigger future bacterial pathogen outbreaks emanating from contaminated environmental habitats.",

Although oils have been employed as carbon sources to produce polyketide antibiotics for several industrial <i>Streptomyces</i> strains, the intrinsic correlation between oil utilization and high production of antibiotics still remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the correlation between oil metabolism and salinomycin biosynthesis in <i>Streptomyces albus</i> ZD11, which employs soybean oil as the main carbon source. Comparative genomic analysis revealed the enrichment of genes related to triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in <i>S. albus</i> ZD11. Transcriptomic profiling further confirmed the enhancement of TAG metabolism and acyl coenzyme A biosynthesis in <i>S. albus</i> ZD11. Multiple secreted lipases, which catalyze TAG hydrolysis, were seen to be working in a synergistic and complementary manner in aiding the efficient and stable hydrolyzation of TAGs. Together, our results suggest that enhanced TAG hydrolysis and fatty acid degradation contribute to the high efficiency of oil utilization in <i>S. albus</i> ZD11 in order to provide abundant carbon precursors for cell growth and salinomycin biosynthesis.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In order to obtain high-level production of antibiotics, oils have been used as the main carbon source for some <i>Streptomyces</i> strains. Based on multiomics analysis, this study provides insight into the relationship between triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism and antibiotic biosynthesis in <i>S. albus</i> ZD11, an oil-preferring industrial <i>Streptomyces</i> strain. Our investigation into TAG hydrolysis yielded further evidence that this strain utilizes complicated strategies enabling an efficient TAG metabolism. In addition, a novel secreted lipase was identified that exhibited highly hydrolytic activity for medium- and long-chain TAGs. Our findings represent a good start toward clarifying the complicated relationship between TAG catabolism and high-level antibiotic production in the industrial strains.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most complex global health challenges today: decades of overuse and misuse in human medicine, animal health, agriculture, and dispersion into the environment have produced the dire consequence of infections to become progressively untreatable. Infection control and prevention (IPC) procedures, the reduction of overuse, and the misuse of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine are the cornerstones required to prevent the spreading of resistant bacteria. Purified drinking water and strongly improved sanitation even in remote areas would prevent the pollution from inadequate treatment of industrial, residential, and farm waste, as all these situations are expanding the resistome in the environment. The One Health concept addresses the interconnected relationships between human, animal, and environmental health as a whole: several countries and international agencies have now included a One Health Approach within their action plans to address AMR. Improved antimicrobial usage, coupled with regulation and policy, as well as integrated surveillance, infection control and prevention, along with antimicrobial stewardship, sanitation, and animal husbandry should all be integrated parts of any new action plan targeted to tackle AMR on the Earth. Since AMR is found in bacteria from humans, animals, and in the environment, we briefly summarize herein the current concepts of One Health as a global challenge to enable the continued use of antibiotics.",

This review discusses C.Â beticola genetics, genomics, and biology and summarizes our current understanding of the molecular interactions that occur between C.Â beticola and its sugar beet host. We highlight the known virulence arsenal of C.Â beticola as well as its ability to overcome currently used disease management strategies. Finally, we discuss future prospects for the study and management of C.Â beticola infections in the context of newly employed molecular tools to uncover additional information regarding the biology of this pathogen.<h4>Taxonomy</h4>Cercospora beticola Sacc.; Kingdom Fungi, Phylum Ascomycota, Class Dothideomycetes, Order Capnodiales, Family Mycosphaerellaceae, Genus Cercospora.<h4>Host range</h4>Well-known pathogen of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) and most species of the Beta genus. Reported as pathogenic on other members of the Chenopodiaceae (e.g., lamb's quarters, spinach) as well as members of the Acanthaceae (e.g., bear's breeches), Apiaceae (e.g., Apium), Asteraceae (e.g., chrysanthemum, lettuce, safflower), Brassicaceae (e.g., wild mustard), Malvaceae (e.g., Malva), Plumbaginaceae (e.g., Limonium), and Polygonaceae (e.g., broad-leaved dock) families.<h4>Disease symptoms</h4>Leaves infected with C.Â beticola exhibit circular lesions that are coloured tan to grey in the centre and are often delimited by tan-brown to reddish-purple rings. As disease progresses, spots can coalesce to form larger necrotic areas, causing severely infected leaves to wither and die. At the centre of these spots are black spore-bearing structures (pseudostromata). Older leaves often show symptoms first and younger leaves become infected as the disease progresses.<h4>Management</h4>Application of a mixture of fungicides with different modes of action is currently performed although elevated resistance has been documented in most employed fungicide classes. Breeding for high-yielding cultivars with improved host resistance is an ongoing effort and prudent cultural practices, such as crop rotation, weed host management, and cultivation to reduce infested residue levels, are widely used to manage disease.

To address this problem, we have designed a novel drug delivery system (DDS) using precipitation-induced Barium (Ba) salt particles. The DDS can load insulin molecules and transport them through the GIT route. There were several in vitro simulation tests carried out to prove the efficiency of Ba salt particles as oral delivery candidates. All three Ba salt particles (BaSO<sub>4</sub>, BaSO<sub>3,</sub> and BaCO<sub>3</sub>) showed very good loading of insulin (>70% in all formulations) and a degree of resistance throughout a wide range of pHs from basic to acidic conditions when assessed by spectrophotometry. Particles and insulin-associated particles were morphologically assessed and characterized using FE-SEM and FT-IR. A set of tests were designed and carried out with mucin to predict whether the particles are potentially capable of overcoming one of the barriers for crossing intestinal epithelium. The mucin binding experiment demonstrated 60-100% of mucin adhesion to the three different particles. FT-IR identifies the characteristic peaks for mucin protein, particles, and particle-mucin complex re-confirming mucin adhesion to the particles. Finally, the effectiveness of nano-insulin was tested on streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. A short acting human insulin analog, insulin aspart, was loaded into Ba salt particles at a dose of 100 IU/Kg prior to oral administration. Among the three formulations, insulin aspart-loaded BaSO<sub>4</sub> and BaCO<sub>3</sub> particles dramatically reduced the existing hyperglycemia. BaSO<sub>4</sub> with loaded Insulin showed an onset of glucose-lowering action within 1 hr, with blood glucose level measured significantly lower compared to the 2nd and 3rd h (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Insulin-loaded BaCO<sub>3</sub> particles showed a significant decrease in blood glucose level at 1-2 h, although the glucose level started to show a slight rise at 3rd h and by 4th h, it was back to baseline level. However, although BaSO<sub>3</sub> particles with loaded insulin showed a trend of reduction in blood glucose level, the reduction was not found to be significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) at any point in time. Therefore, oral formulations of insulin/BaSO<sub>4</sub> and insulin/BaCO<sub>3</sub> particles were observed as effective as native insulin aspart subcutaneous formulation in terms of onset and duration of action. Further investigation will be needed to reveal bioavailability and mechanism of action of this novel Nano-Insulin formulations.",

We have interrogated extracts from fungal fermentations to find <i>Cryptococcus</i>-inhibiting natural products using assays for growth inhibition, differential thermosensitivity, and synergy with existing antifungal drugs. Extracts from fermentations of strains of <i>Discosia rubi</i> from eastern Texas showed anticryptococcal bioactivity with preferential activity in agar zone of inhibition assays against <i>C. neoformans</i> at 37Â°C versus 25Â°C. Assay-guided fractionation led to the purification and identification of chaetoglobosin P as the active component of these extracts. Genome sequencing of these strains revealed a biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with chaetoglobosin biosynthesis and Î²-methylation of the tryptophan residue. Proximity of genes of the actin-binding protein twinfilin-1 to the chaetoglobosin P and K gene clusters suggested a possible self-resistance mechanism involving twinfilin-1 which is consistent with the predicted mechanism of action involving interference with the polymerization of the capping process of filamentous actin. A <i>C. neoformans</i> mutant lacking twinfilin-1 was hypersensitive to chaetoglobosin P. Chaetoglobosins also potentiated the effects of amphotericin B and caspofungin on <i>C. neoformans</i>.",

Despite biomedical and pharmaceutical importance, the molecular mechanisms and architectures of these multimodular enzyme complexes are not fully understood. Here, we report on an ABC transporter that forms a vital part of the nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic machinery. Emetic <i>Bacillus cereus</i> produces the highly potent, mitochondrial active nonribosomal depsipeptide cereulide, synthesized by the NRPS Ces. The <i>ces</i> gene locus includes, next to the structural <i>cesAB</i> genes, a putative ABC transporter, designated <i>cesCD</i> Our study demonstrates that tethering of CesAB synthetase to the cell membrane by CesCD is critical for peptide assembly. <i>In vivo</i> studies revealed that CesAB colocalizes with CesCD on the cell membrane, suggesting direct involvement of this ABC transporter in the biosynthesis of a nonribosomal peptide. Mutation of <i>cesCD</i>, disrupting the assembly of the CesCD complex, resulted in decreased interaction with CesAB and, as a consequence, negatively affected cereulide biosynthesis. Specific domains within CesAB synthetase interacting with CesC were identified. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the structurally similar BerAB transporter from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> complements CesCD function in cereulide biosynthesis, suggesting that the direct involvement of ABC transporter in secondary metabolite biosynthesis could be a widespread mechanism. In summary, our study revealed a novel, noncanonical function for ABC transporter, which is essential for megaenzyme functionality of NRPS. The new insights into natural product biosynthesis gained may facilitate the discovery of new metabolites with bioactive potential.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study revealed a novel, potentially conserved mechanism involved in the biosynthesis of microbial natural products, exemplified by the mitochondrial active depsipeptide cereulide. Similar to other bioactive substances, such as the last-resort antibiotics vancomycin and daptomycin, the antitumor drug cryptophycin or the cholesterol-lowering agent lovastatin, cereulide is synthesized nonribosomally by multienzyme machinery, requiring the concerted actions of multiple proteins to ensure correct product assembly. Given the importance of microbial secondary metabolites in human and veterinary medicine, it is critical to understand how these processes are orchestrated within the host cells. By revealing that tethering of a biosynthetic enzyme to the cell membrane by an ABC transporter is essential for nonribosomal peptide production, our study provides novel insights into synthesis of microbial secondary metabolites, which could contribute to isolation of novel compounds from cryptic secondary metabolite clusters or improve the yield of produced pharmaceuticals.",

In bacteria, glycosylase-mediated ICL unhooking was described in Streptomyces as a means of self-resistance to the genotoxic natural product azinomycin B. The mechanistic details and general utility of glycosylase-mediated ICL repair in other bacteria are unknown. Here, we identify the uncharacterized Escherichia coli protein YcaQ as an ICL repair glycosylase that protects cells against the toxicity of crosslinking agents. YcaQ unhooks both sides of symmetric and asymmetric ICLs in vitro, and loss or overexpression of ycaQ sensitizes E. coli to the nitrogen mustard mechlorethamine.

        "pmc_abstract": "Multi-drug resistant pathogens have become a major threat to human health and new antibiotics are urgently needed. Most antibiotics are derived from secondary metabolites produced by bacteria. In order to avoid suicide, these bacteria usually encode resistance genes, in some cases within the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of the respective antibiotic compound. Modern genome mining tools enable researchers to computationally detect and predict BGCs that encode the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The major challenge now is the prioritization of the most promising BGCs encoding antibiotics with novel modes of action. A recently developed target-directed genome mining approach allows researchers to predict the mode of action of the encoded compound of an uncharacterized BGC based on the presence of resistant target genes. In 2017, we introduced the 'Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker' (ARTS). ARTS allows for specific and efficient genome mining for antibiotics with interesting and novel targets by rapidly linking housekeeping and known resistance genes to BGC proximity, duplication and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. Here, we present ARTS 2.0 available at http://arts.ziemertlab.com. ARTS 2.0 now includes options for automated target directed genome mining in all bacterial taxa as well as metagenomic data. Furthermore, it enables comparison of similar BGCs from different genomes and their putative resistance genes.",

Diterpenoids \"Taxol\" is the most effective anticancer drug with highest annual sale, since its discovery in 1970 from the Pacific yew tree, <i>Taxus brevifolia</i>. However, the lower yield of Taxol from this natural source (bark of <i>T. brevifolia</i>), availability and vulnerability of this plant to unpredicted fluctuation with the ecological and environmental conditions are the challenges. Endophytic fungi from <i>Taxus</i> spp. opened a new avenue for industrial Taxol production due to their fast growth, cost effectiveness, independence on climatic changes, feasibility of genetic manipulation. However, the anticipation of endophytic fungi for industrial Taxol production has been challenged by the loss of its productivity, due to the metabolic reprograming of cells, downregulating the expression of its encoding genes with subculturing and storage. Thus, the objectives of this review were to (1) Nominate the endophytic fungal isolates with the Taxol producing potency from <i>Taxaceae</i> and <i>Podocarpaceae</i>; (2) Emphasize the different approaches such as molecular manipulation, cultural optimization, co-cultivation for enhancing the Taxol productivities; (3) Accentuate the genome mining of the rate-limiting enzymes for rapid screening the Taxol biosynthetic machinery; (4) Triggering the silenced rate-limiting genes and transcriptional factors to activates the biosynthetic gene cluster of Taxol.",

RiPPs have recently been shown to occupy a much larger expanse of genomic and chemical space than previously appreciated, indicating that annotation of RiPP BGCs in genomes may have been overlooked in the past. This review provides an overview of the genome mining tools that have been specifically developed to aid in the discovery of RiPP BGCs, which have been built from an increasing knowledgebase of RiPP structures and biosynthesis.

We investigated the characteristics of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> clinical strains naturally resistant to phages and compared them to highly susceptible strains. The phage-resistant strains were defective in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, were nonmotile and displayed an important degree of autolysis, releasing phages and pyocins. Complete genome sequencing of three resistant strains showed the existence of a large accessory genome made of multiple insertion elements, genomic islands, pyocins and prophages, including two phages performing lateral transduction. Mutations were found in genes responsible for the synthesis of LPS and/or type IV pilus, the major receptors for most phages. CRISPR-Cas systems appeared to be absent or inactive in phage-resistant strains, confirming that they do not play a role in the resistance to lytic phages but control the insertion of exogenous sequences. We show that, despite their apparent weakness, the multiphage-resistant strains described in this study displayed selective advantages through the possession of various functions, including weapons to eliminate other strains of the same or closely related species.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are considered drugs of \"last resort\" for the treatment of life-threatening infections caused by relevant Gram-positive pathogens (enterococci, staphylococci, and clostridia). Driven by the issue of the never-stopping evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance, research on GPA biosynthesis and resistance is developing fast in modern \"post-genomic\" era. It is today widely accepted that resistance mechanisms emerging in pathogens have been acquired from the soil-dwelling antibiotic-producing actinomycetes, which use them to avoid suicide during production, rather than being orchestrated <i>de novo</i> by pathogen bacteria upon continued treatment. Actually, more and more genomes of GPA producers are being unraveled, carrying a broad collection of differently arranged GPA resistance (named <i>van</i>) genes. In the producer actinomycetes, <i>van</i> genes are generally associated with the antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) deputed to GPA biosynthesis, being probably transferred/arranged together, favoring a possible co-regulation between antibiotic production and self-resistance. GPA BGC-associated <i>van</i> genes have been also found mining public databases of bacterial genomic and metagenomic sequences. Interestingly, some BGCs for antibiotics, seemingly unrelated to GPAs (e.g., feglymycin), carry <i>van</i> gene homologues. Herein, we would like to cover the recent advances on the distribution of GPA resistance genes in genomic and metagenomics datasets related to GPA potential/proved producer microorganisms. A thorough understanding of GPA resistance in the producing microorganisms may prove useful in the future surveillance of emerging mechanisms of resistance to this clinically relevant antibiotic class.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Covering: 2014 up to the third quarter of 2019 Hypocrealean entomopathogenic fungi (HEF) produce a large variety of secondary metabolites (SMs) that are prominent virulence factors or mediate various interactions in the native niches of these organisms. Many of these SMs show insecticidal, immune system modulatory, antimicrobial, cytotoxic and other bioactivities of clinical or agricultural significance. Recent advances in whole genome sequencing technologies and bioinformatics have revealed many biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) potentially involved in SM production in HEF. Some of these BGCs are now well characterized, with the structures of the cognate product congeners elucidated, and the proposed biosynthetic functions of key enzymes validated. However, the vast majority of HEF BGCs are still not linked to SM products (\"orphan\" BGCs), including many clusters that are not expressed (silent) under routine laboratory conditions. Thus, investigations into the encoded parvome (the secondary metabolome predicted from the genome) of HEF allows the discovery of BGCs for known SMs; uncovers novel metabolites based on the BGCs; and catalogues the predicted SM biosynthetic potential of these fungi. Herein, we summarize new developments of the field, and survey the polyketide, nonribosomal peptide, terpenoid and hybrid SM BGCs encoded in the currently available 40 HEF genome sequences. Studying the encoded parvome of HEF will increase our understanding of the multifaceted roles that SMs play in biotic and abiotic interactions and will also reveal biologically active SMs that can be exploited for the discovery of human and veterinary drugs or crop protection agents.",

GlyU is further modified with an N-alkylamine linker, the biosynthetic origin of which has yet to be established. By using a combination of feeding experiments with isotopically labeled precursors and characterization of recombinant proteins from multiple pathways, the biosynthetic mechanism for N-alkylamine installation for ADR-GlyU-containing nucleoside antibiotics has been uncovered. The data reveal S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as the direct precursor of the N-alkylamine, but, unlike conventional AdoMet- or decarboxylated AdoMet-dependent alkyltransferases, the reaction is catalyzed by a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent aminobutyryltransferase (ABTase) using a stepwise Î³-replacement mechanism that couples Î³-elimination of AdoMet with aza-Î³-addition onto the disaccharide alkyl acceptor. In addition to using a conceptually different strategy for AdoMet-dependent alkylation, the newly discovered ABTases require a phosphorylated disaccharide alkyl acceptor, revealing a cryptic intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway.",

An analysis of the fungal genome sequence to assess its metabolic potential was implemented using the bioinformatic tool antiSMASH. In total, 36 putative biosynthetic gene clusters were found with a majority encoding for polyketides (17), followed by non-ribosomal peptides (14), terpenes (2), ribosomal peptides (1), and compounds with mixed biosynthetic origin (2).

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is notoriously known for its rapid development of resistance to conventional antibiotics. <i>S. aureus</i> can alter its membrane composition to reduce the killing effect of antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). To obtain a more complete picture, this study identified the resistance genes of <i>S. aureus</i> in response to human cathelicidin LL-37 peptides by screening the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library. In total, 24 resistant genes were identified. Among them, six mutants, including the one with the known membrane-modifying gene (<i>mprF</i>) disabled, became more membrane permeable to the LL-37 engineered peptide 17BIPHE2 than the wild type. Mass spectrometry analysis detected minimal lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (lysylPG) from the <i>mprF</i> mutant of <i>S. aureus</i> JE2, confirming loss-of-function of this gene. Moreover, multiple mutants showed reduced surface adhesion and biofilm formation. In addition, four <i>S. aureus</i> mutants were unable to infect wax moth <i>Galleria mellonella</i>. There appears to be a connection between the ability of bacterial attachment/biofilm formation and infection. These results underscore the multiple functional roles of the identified peptide-response genes in bacterial growth, infection, and biofilm formation. Therefore, <i>S. aureus</i> utilizes a set of resistant genes to weave a complex molecular network to handle the danger posed by cationic LL-37. It appears that different genes are involved depending on the nature of antimicrobials. These resistant genes may offer a novel avenue to designing more potent antibiotics that target the Achilles heels of <i>S. aureus</i> USA300, a community-associated pathogen of great threat.",

Herein, we highlight current knowledge on bacterial tropones and their derivatives such as tropolones, tropodithietic acid, and roseobacticides. Their unusual biosynthesis depends on a universal CoA-bound precursor featuring a seven-membered carbon ring as backbone, which is generated by a side reaction of the phenylacetic acid catabolic pathway. Enzymes encoded by separate gene clusters then further modify this key intermediate by oxidation, CoA-release, or incorporation of sulfur among other reactions. Tropones play important roles in the terrestrial and marine environment where they act as antibiotics, algaecides, or quorum sensing signals, while their bacterial producers are often involved in symbiotic interactions with plants and marine invertebrates (e.âg., algae, corals, sponges, or mollusks). Because of their potent bioactivities and of slowly developing bacterial resistance, tropones and their derivatives hold great promise for biomedical or biotechnological applications, for instance as antibiotics in (shell)fish aquaculture.",

We confirmed that the producing strain NRRL 8095 is Penicillium arenicola and other strains of P. arenicola produced acrophiarin and acrophiarin analogues. Genome sequencing of NRRL 8095 identified the acrophiarin gene cluster. Penicillium arenicola and echinocandin-producing Aspergillus species belong to the family Aspergillaceae of the Eurotiomycetes, but several features of acrophiarin and its gene cluster suggest a closer relationship with echinocandins from Leotiomycete fungi. These features include hydroxy-glutamine in the peptide core instead of a serine or threonine residue, the inclusion of a non-heme iron, Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase for hydroxylation of the C3 of the glutamine, and a thioesterase. In addition, P. arenicola bears similarity to Leotiomycete echinocandin-producing species because it exhibits self-resistance to exogenous echinocandins. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes of the echinocandin biosynthetic family indicated that most of the predicted proteins of acrophiarin gene cluster exhibited higher similarity to the predicted proteins of the pneumocandin gene cluster of the Leotiomycete Glarea lozoyensis than to those of the echinocandin B gene cluster from A. pachycristatus. The fellutamide gene cluster and related gene clusters are recognized as relatives of the echinocandins. Inclusion of the acrophiarin gene cluster into a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of echinocandin gene clusters indicated the divergent evolutionary lineages of echinocandin gene clusters are descendants from a common ancestral progenitor. The minimal 10-gene cluster may have undergone multiple gene acquisitions or losses and possibly horizontal gene transfer after the ancestral separation of the two lineages.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Light is known to trigger regulatory responses in diverse organisms, including slime molds, animals, plants, and phototrophic bacteria. However, light-dependent processes in nonphototrophic bacteria, and those of pathogens in particular, have received comparatively little research attention. In this study, we examined the impact of light on multicellular development in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a leading cause of biofilm-based bacterial infections. We grew <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strain PA14 in a colony morphology assay and found that growth under prolonged exposure to low-intensity blue light inhibited biofilm matrix production and thereby the formation of vertical biofilm structures (i.e., \"wrinkles\"). Light-dependent inhibition of biofilm wrinkling was correlated with low levels of cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), consistent with the role of this signal in stimulating matrix production. A screen of enzymes with the potential to catalyze c-di-GMP synthesis or degradation identified c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases that contribute to light-dependent inhibition of biofilm wrinkling. One of these, RmcA, was previously characterized by our group for its role in mediating the effect of redox-active <i>P. aeruginosa</i> metabolites called phenazines on biofilm wrinkle formation. Our results suggest that an RmcA sensory domain that is predicted to bind a flavin cofactor is involved in light-dependent inhibition of wrinkling. Together, these findings indicate that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> integrates information about light exposure and redox state in its regulation of biofilm development.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Light exposure tunes circadian rhythms, which modulate the immune response and affect susceptibility to infection in plants and animals. Though molecular responses to light are defined for model plant and animal hosts, analogous pathways that function in bacterial pathogens are understudied. We examined the response to light exposure in biofilms (matrix-encased multicellular assemblages) of the nonphotosynthetic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> We found that light at intensities that are not harmful to human cells inhibited biofilm maturation via effects on cellular signals. Because biofilm formation is a critical factor in many types of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections, including burn wound infections that may be exposed to light, these effects could be relevant for pathogenicity.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Time-of-day dependent fluctuations in exercise performance have been documented across different sports and seem to affect both endurance and resistance modes of exercise. Most of the studies published to date have shown that the performance in short-duration maximal exercises (i.e. less than 1âmin - e.g. sprints, jumps, isometric contractions) exhibits diurnal fluctuations, peaking between 16:00 and 20:00âh. However, the time-of-day effects on short duration exercise performance may be minimized by the following factors: (1) short exposures to moderately warm and humid environments; (2) active warm-up protocols; (3) intermittent fasting conditions; (4) warming-up while listening to music; or (5) prolonged periods of training at a specific time of day. This suggests that short-duration maximal exercise performance throughout the day is controlled not only by body temperature, hormone levels, motivation and mood state but also by a versatile circadian system within skeletal muscle. The time of day at which short-duration maximal exercise is conducted represents an important variable for training prescription. However, the literature available to date lacks a specific review on this subject. Therefore, the present review aims to (1) elucidate time-of-day specific effects on short-duration maximal exercise performance and (2) discuss strategies to promote better performance in short-duration maximal exercises at different times of the day.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Colibactin is a secondary metabolite produced by certain strains of bacteria found in the human gut. The presence of colibactin-producing bacteria has been correlated to colorectal cancer in humans. Colibactin was first discovered in 2006, but because it is produced in small quantities and is unstable, it has yet to be isolated from bacterial cultures. Here we summarize advances in the field since ~2017 that have led to the identification of the structure of colibactin as a heterodimer containing two DNA-reactive electrophilic cyclopropane residues. Colibactin has been shown to form interstrand cross-links by alkylation of adenine residues on opposing strands of DNA. The structure of colibactin contains two thiazole rings separated by a two-carbon linker that is thought to exist as an Î±-aminoketone following completion of the biosynthetic pathway. However, synthetic studies have now established that this Î±-aminoketone is unstable toward aerobic oxidation; the resulting oxidation products are in turn unstable toward nucleophilic cleavage under mild conditions. These data provide a simple molecular-level explanation for colibactin's instability and potentially also explain the observation that cell-to-cell contact is required for genotoxic effects.",

To prevent self-harm from bioactive NPs, some microbial producers employ self-resistance genes to protect themselves. One effective strategy is to employ a self-resistance enzyme (SRE), which is a slightly mutated version of the original metabolic enzyme, and is resistant to the toxic NP but is still functional. The presence of a SRE in a gene cluster can serve as a predictive window to the biological activity of the NPs synthesized by the pathway. In this highlight, we summarize representative examples of NP biosynthetic pathways that utilize self-resistance genes for protection. Recent discoveries based on self-resistance gene identification have helped in bridging the gap between activity-guided and genome-driven approaches for NP discovery and functional assignment.",

Here, we review five archetypical examples of interfacial inhibitors: the camptothecins, etoposide, the quinolone antibiotics, the vinca alkaloids and the novel anti-HIV inhibitor raltegravir.

However, there are less reports concerning the effects of NO on fungal secondary metabolites. Hypocrellins are effective anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents from fungal perylenequinone pigments of Shiraia. NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was used as a chemical elicitor to promote hypocrellin biosynthesis in Shiraia mycelium cultures.<h4>Results</h4>SNP application at 0.01-0.20Â mM was found to stimulate significantly fungal production of perylenequinones including hypocrellin A (HA) and elsinochrome A (EA). SNP application could not only enhance HA content by 178.96% in mycelia, but also stimulate its efflux to the medium. After 4Â days of SNP application at 0.02Â mM, the highest total production (110.34Â mg/L) of HA was achieved without any growth suppression. SNP released NO in mycelia and acted as a pro-oxidant, thereby up-regulating the gene expression and activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating NADPH oxidase (NOX) and antioxidant enzymes, leading to the increased levels of superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that SNP treatment could up-regulate biosynthetic genes for hypocrellins and activate the transporter protein major facilitator superfamily (MFS) for the exudation. Moreover, SNP treatment increased the proportion of total unsaturated fatty acids in the hypha membranes and enhanced membrane permeability. Our results indicated both cellular biosynthesis of HA and its secretion could contribute to HA production induced by SNP.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of this study provide a valuable strategy for large-scale hypocrellin production and can facilitate further understanding and exploration of NO signaling in the biosynthesis of the important fungal metabolites.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The introduction of Î²-hydroxy-Î±-amino acids (Î²HAAs) into organic molecules has received considerable attention as these molecules have often found widespread applications in bioorganic chemistry, medicinal chemistry and biomaterial science. Despite innovation of asymmetric synthesis of Î²HAAs, stereoselective synthesis to control the two chiral centres at C<sub>Î±</sub> and C<sub>Î²</sub> positions is still challenging, with poor atomic economy and multi protection and deprotection steps. These syntheses are often operated under harsh conditions. Therefore, a biotransformation approach using biocatalysts is needed to selectively introduce these two chiral centres into structurally diverse molecules. Yet, there are few ways that enable one-step synthesis of Î²HAAs. One is to extend the substrate scope of the existing enzyme inventory. Threonine aldolases have been explored to produce Î²HAAs. However, the enzymes have poor controlled installation at C<sub>Î²</sub> position, often resulting in a mixture of diastereoisomers which are difficult to be separated. In this respect, L-threonine transaldolases (LTTAs) offer an excellent potential as the enzymes often provide controlled stereochemistry at C<sub>Î±</sub> and C<sub>Î²</sub> positions. Another is to mine LTTA homologues and engineer the enzymes using directed evolution with the aim of finding engineered biocatalysts to accept broad substrates with enhanced conversion and stereoselectivity. Here, we review the development of LTTAs that incorporate various aldehyde acceptors to generate structurally diverse Î²HAAs and highlight areas for future developments.

        "pmc_abstract": "A novel approach targeting self-inducible surfactin synthesis under oxygen-limited conditions is presented. Because both the nitrate (NarGHI) and nitrite (NasDE) reductase are highly expressed during anaerobic growth of B. subtilis, the native promoter P<sub>srfA</sub> of the surfactin operon in strain B. subtilis JABs24 was replaced by promoters P<sub>narG</sub> and P<sub>nasD</sub> to induce surfactin synthesis anaerobically. Shake flask cultivations with varying oxygen availabilities indicated no significant differences in native P<sub>srfA</sub> expression. As hypothesized, activity of P<sub>narG</sub> and P<sub>nasD</sub> increased with lower oxygen levels and surfactin was not produced by P<sub>srfA</sub>::P<sub>narG</sub> as well as P<sub>srfA</sub>::P<sub>nasD</sub> mutant strains under conditions with highest oxygen availability. P<sub>narG</sub> showed expressions similar to P<sub>srfA</sub> at lowest oxygen availability, while maximum value of P<sub>nasD</sub> was more than 5.5-fold higher. Although the promoter exchange P<sub>srfA</sub>::P<sub>narG</sub> resulted in a decreased surfactin titer at lowest oxygen availability, the strain carrying P<sub>srfA</sub>::P<sub>nasD</sub> reached a 1.4-fold increased surfactin concentration with 696Â mg/L and revealed an exceptional high overall Y<sub>P/X</sub> of 1.007Â g/g. This value also surpassed the Y<sub>P/X</sub> of the reference strain JABs24 at highest and moderate oxygen availability. Bioreactor cultivations illustrated that significant cell lysis occurred when the process of \"anaerobization\" was performed too fast. However, processes with a constantly low agitation and aeration rate showed promising potential for process improvement, especially by employing the strain carrying P<sub>srfA</sub>::P<sub>nasD</sub> promoter exchange. Additionally, replacement of other native promoters by nitrite reductase promoter P<sub>nasD</sub> represents a promising tool for anaerobic-inducible bioprocesses in Bacillus.",

Around 60% of the antibiotics used today were obtained from the genus Streptomyces. The river sediments of Bangladesh are still an unexplored source for antibiotic-producing bacteria (APB). This study aimed to isolate novel APB from Padma and Kapotakkho river sediments having the potential to produce antibacterialÂ compounds with known scaffolds by manipulating their self-protection mechanisms.<h4>Results</h4>The antibiotic supplemented starch-casein-nitrate agar (SCNA) media were used to isolate antibiotic-resistant APB from the river sediments. The colonies having Streptomyces-like morphology were selectively purified and their antagonistic activity was screened against a range of test bacteria using the cross-streaking method. A notable decrease of the colony-forming units (CFUs) in the antibiotic supplemented SCNA plates compared to control plates (where added antibiotics were absent) was observed. A total of three azithromycin resistant (AZR) and nine meropenem resistant (MPR) isolates were purified and their antagonistic activity was investigated against a series of test bacteria including Shigella brodie, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Proteus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. All the AZR isolates and all but two MPR isolates exhibited moderate to high broad-spectrum activity. Among the isolates, 16S rDNA sequencing of NAr5 and NAr6 were performed to identify them up to species level. The analyses of the sequences revealed that both belong to the genus Streptomyces.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results from these studies suggest that manipulation of the self-resistance property of APB is an easy and quick method to search for novel APB having the potential to produce potentially novel antibacterial compounds with known scaffolds.",

The inhibition of DNA replication often triggers double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) at stalled DNA replication sites, resulting in cytotoxicity. In East Asia, some traditional medicines are administered as anticancer drugs, although the mechanisms underlying their pharmacological effects are not entirely understood. In this study, we screened Japanese herbal medicines and identified two benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs), berberine and coptisine. These alkaloids mildly induced DSBs, and this effect was dependent on the function of topoisomerase I (Topo I) and MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease. Biochemical analysis revealed that the action of BIAs involves inhibiting the catalytic activity of Topo I rather than inducing the accumulation of the Topo I-DNA complex, which is different from the action of camptothecin (CPT). Furthermore, the results showed that BIAs can act as inhibitors of Topo I, even against CPT-resistant mutants, and that the action of these BIAs was independent of CPT. These results suggest that using a combination of BIAs and CPT might increase their efficiency in eliminating cancer cells.",

We identify a 6-TG biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chromogenes and other coagulase-negative staphylococci including S. epidermidis, S. pseudintermedius and S. capitis. Recombinant S. aureus strains harbouring this operon produce 6-TG and, when used in subcutaneous co-infections in mice with virulent S. aureus USA300, protect the host from necrotic lesion formation. Used prophylactically, 6-TG reduces necrotic skin lesions in mice infected with USA300, and this effect is mediated by abrogation of toxin production. RNAseq analyses reveal that 6-TG downregulates expression of genes coding for purine biosynthesis, the accessory gene regulator (agr) and ribosomal proteins in S. aureus, providing an explanation for its effect on toxin production.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Surfactin is a lipoheptapeptide produced by several <i>Bacillus</i> species and identified for the first time in 1969. At first, the biosynthesis of this remarkable biosurfactant was described in this review. The peptide moiety of the surfactin is synthesized using huge multienzymatic proteins called NonRibosomal Peptide Synthetases. This mechanism is responsible for the peptide biodiversity of the members of the surfactin family. In addition, on the fatty acid side, fifteen different isoforms (from C12 to C17) can be incorporated so increasing the number of the surfactin-like biomolecules. The review also highlights the last development in metabolic modeling and engineering and in synthetic biology to direct surfactin biosynthesis but also to generate novel derivatives. This large set of different biomolecules leads to a broad spectrum of physico-chemical properties and biological activities. The last parts of the review summarized the numerous studies related to the production processes optimization as well as the approaches developed to increase the surfactin productivity of <i>Bacillus</i> cells taking into account the different steps of its biosynthesis from gene transcription to surfactin degradation in the culture medium.",

By December 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had infected over 65 million people globally, resulting in more than 1 million deaths. At present, the exact animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear and antiviral vaccines are now undergoing clinical trials. Although the social order of human life is gradually returning to normal, new confirmed cases continue to appear worldwide, and the majority of cases are sporadic due to environmental factors and lax self-protective consciousness. This article provides the latest understanding of the epidemiology and risk factors of nosocomial and community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as well as strategies to diminish the risk of transmission. We believe that our review will help the public correctly understand and cope with SARS-CoV-2.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), commonly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first revealed in late 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. It was subsequently spread globally and thereby declared as a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. The disease causes severe acute respiratory illness and is highly contagious due to the fast-onward transmission. As of the mid of November 2020, the disease has affected 220 countries with more than 16 million active cases and 1.3 million deaths worldwide. Males, pregnant women, the elderly, immunosuppressed patients, and those with underlying medical conditions are more vulnerable to the disease than the general healthy population. Unfortunately, no definite treatment is available. Although remdesivir as an antiviral had been approved for use in those above 12Â years of age and 40Â kg weight group, it has been observed to be ineffective in large-scale SOLIDARITY trials by WHO. Moreover, dexamethasone has been found to increase the recovery rate of ventilated patients; oxygen and inhaled nitric oxide as a vasodilator have been given emergency expanded access. In addition, more than 57 clinical trials are being conducted for the development of the vaccines on various platforms. Two vaccines were found to be significantly promising in phase III results. It is concluded that till the approval of a specific treatment or development of a vaccine against this deadly disease, the preventive measures should be followed strictly to reduce the spread of the disease.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Twenty-eight multidrug-resistant bacterial strains closely related or identical to <i>Pedobacter cryoconitis</i>, <i>Pedobacter lusitanus</i> and <i>Pedobacter steynii</i> were isolated from soil samples by selection for multidrug-resistance. Approximately 3-30% of the selected isolates were identified as <i>Pedobacter</i>, whereas isolation without antibiotics did not yield any isolates of this genus. Next generation sequencing data showed <i>Pedobacter</i> to be on 69th place among the bacterial genera (0.32% of bacterial sequences). The <i>Pedobacter</i> isolates produced a wide array of novel compounds when screened by UHPLC-MS/MSMS, and hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in several distinct clusters of compounds produced by specific isolates of <i>Pedobacter</i>, and most of these compounds were found to be peptides. The <i>Pedobacter</i> strain UP508 produced isopedopeptins, whereas another set of strains produced pedopeptins, which both are known cyclic lipodepsipeptides produced by <i>Pedobacter</i> sp. Other <i>Pedobacter</i> strains produced analogous peptides with a sequence variation. Further strains of <i>Pedobacter</i> produced additional novel antibacterial cyclic lipopeptides (ca 800 or 1400 Da in size) and/or linear lipopeptides (ca 700-960 Da in size). A 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree for the <i>Pedobacter</i> isolates revealed several distinct clades and subclades of isolates. One of the subclades comprised isolates producing isopedopeptin analogs, but the isopedopeptin producing isolate UP508 was clearly placed on a separate branch. We suggest that the non-ribosomal peptide synthases producing pedopeptins, isopedopeptins, and the analogous peptides, may derive from a common ancestral non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene cluster, which may have been subjected to a mutation leading to changed specificity in one of the modules and then to a modular rearrangement leading to the changed sequence found in the isopedopeptins produced by isolate UP508.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antibiotic-producing microorganisms have developed several self-resistance mechanisms to protect them from autotoxicity. Transporters belonging to the resistance- nodulation-division (RND) superfamily commonly confer multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. Phenazines are heterocyclic, nitrogen-containing and redox-active compounds that exhibit diverse activities. We previously identified six phenazines from <i>Lysobacter antibioticus</i> OH13, a soil bacterium emerging as a potential biocontrol agent. Among these phenazines, myxin, a di-<i>N</i>-oxide phenazine, exhibited potent activity against a variety of microorganisms. In this study, we identified a novel RND efflux pump gene cluster, designated <i>lexABC</i>, which is located far away in the genome from the myxin biosynthesis gene cluster. We found a putative LysR-type transcriptional regulator encoding gene <i>lexR</i>, which was adjacent to <i>lexABC</i>. Deletion of <i>lexABC or lexR</i> gene resulted in significant increasing susceptibility of strains to myxin and loss of myxin production. The results demonstrated that LexABC pump conferred resistance against myxin. The myxin produced at lower concentrations in these mutants was derivatized by deoxidation and <i>O</i>-methylation. Furthermore, we found that the abolishment of myxin with deletion of <i>LaPhzB</i>, which is an essential gene in myxin biosynthesis, resulted in significant downregulation of the <i>lexABC.</i> However, exogenous supplementation with myxin to <i>LaPhzB</i> mutant could efficiently induce the expression of <i>lexABC</i> genes. Moreover, <i>lexR</i> mutation also led to decreased expression of <i>lexABC</i>, which indicates that LexR potentially positively modulated the expression of <i>lexABC</i>. Our findings reveal a resistance mechanism against myxin of <i>L. antibioticus</i>, which coordinates regulatory pathways to protect itself from autotoxicity.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Streptomycetes are well-known producers of numerous bioactive secondary metabolites widely used in medicine, agriculture, and veterinary. Usually, their genomes encode 20-30 clusters for the biosynthesis of natural products. Generally, the onset and production of these compounds are tightly coordinated at multiple regulatory levels, including cluster-situated transcriptional factors. Rishirilides are biologically active type II polyketides produced by <i>Streptomyces bottropensis</i>. The complex regulation of rishirilides biosynthesis includes the interplay of four regulatory proteins encoded by the <i>rsl</i>-gene cluster: three SARP family regulators (RslR1-R3) and one MarR-type transcriptional factor (RslR4). In this work, employing gene deletion and overexpression experiments we revealed RslR1-R3 to be positive regulators of the biosynthetic pathway. Additionally, transcriptional analysis indicated that <i>rslR2</i> is regulated by RslR1 and RslR3. Furthermore, RslR3 directly activates the transcription of <i>rslR2</i>, which stems from binding of RslR3 to the <i>rslR2</i> promoter. Genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that RslR4 represses the transcription of the MFS transporter <i>rslT4</i> and of its own gene. Moreover, DNA-binding affinity of RslR4 is strictly controlled by specific interaction with rishirilides and some of their biosynthetic precursors. Altogether, our findings revealed the intricate regulatory network of teamworking cluster-situated regulators governing the biosynthesis of rishirilides and strain self-immunity.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Chemical alterations in DNA induced by genotoxic factors can have a complex nature such as bulky DNA adducts, interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs), and clustered DNA lesions (including double-strand breaks, DSB). Complex DNA damage (CDD) has a complex character/structure as compared to singular lesions like randomly distributed abasic sites, deaminated, alkylated, and oxidized DNA bases. CDD is thought to be critical since they are more challenging to repair than singular lesions. Although CDD naturally constitutes a relatively minor fraction of the overall DNA damage induced by free radicals, DNA cross-linking agents, and ionizing radiation, if left unrepaired, these lesions cause a number of serious consequences, such as gross chromosomal rearrangements and genome instability. If not tightly controlled, the repair of ICLs and clustered bi-stranded oxidized bases via DNA excision repair will either inhibit initial steps of repair or produce persistent chromosomal breaks and consequently be lethal for the cells. Biochemical and genetic evidences indicate that the removal of CDD requires concurrent involvement of a number of distinct DNA repair pathways including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-mediated DNA strand break repair, base excision repair (BER), nucleotide incision repair (NIR), global genome and transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER and TC-NER, respectively), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) pathways. In this review, we describe the role of DNA glycosylase-mediated BER pathway in the removal of complex DNA lesions.",

Here, we review one of the most popular alternatives amongst basic and applied research scientists, synthetic antimicrobial peptides. The ease of peptide chemical synthesis combined with emerging engineering principles and potent broad-spectrum activity, including against multidrug-resistant strains, has motivated intense scientific focus on these compounds for the past decade. This global effort has resulted in significant advances in our understanding of peptide antimicrobial activity at the molecular scale. Recent evidence of molecular targets other than the microbial lipid membrane, and efforts towards consensus antimicrobial peptide motifs, have supported the rise of molecular engineering approaches and design tools, including machine learning. Beyond molecular concepts, supramolecular chemistry has been lately added to the debate; and helped unravel the impact of peptide self-assembly on activity, including on biofilms and secondary targets, while providing new directions in pharmaceutical formulation through taking advantage of peptide self-assembled nanostructures. We argue that these basic research advances constitute a solid basis for promising industry translation of rationally designed synthetic peptide antimicrobials, not only as novel drugs against multidrug-resistant strains but also as components of emerging antimicrobial biomaterials. This perspective is supported by recent developments of innovative peptide-based and peptide-carrier nanobiomaterials that we also review.",

This represents a novel antibacterial mode of action and it is known that PUM inhibits bacterial RNAP in vitro, inhibits bacterial growth in vitro, and was active in vivo in a mouse infection model of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> peritonitis. The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was previously identified and characterized by knockout experiments. However, the minimal set of genes necessary for PUM production was not proposed. To identify the minimal BGC and to create a plug-and-play production platform for PUM and its biosynthetic precursors, several versions of a redesigned PUM BGC were generated and expressed in the heterologous host <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> M1146 under control of strong promotors. Heterologous expression allowed identification of the putative serine/threonine kinase PumF as an enzyme essential for heterologous PUM production and thus corroboration of the PUM minimal BGC.",

We show that killing between phylogenetically closely-related strains involves contractile phage tail-like devices called R-tailocins that puncture target cell membranes. Using live-cell imaging, we evidence that R-tailocins are produced at the cell center, transported to the cell poles and ejected by explosive cell lysis. This enables their dispersal over several tens of micrometers to reach targeted cells. We visualize R-tailocin-mediated competition dynamics between closely-related Pseudomonas strains at the single-cell level, both in non-induced condition and upon artificial induction. We document the fatal impact of cellular self-sacrifice coupled to deployment of phage tail-like weaponry in the microenvironment of kin bacterial competitors, emphasizing the necessity for microscale assessment of microbial competitions.",

We also report 273 nitrogen-containing metabolites, including diverse monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs). A comparative genomics approach identifies strictosidine biogenesis as the origin of MIA evolution. The emergence of strictosidine biosynthesis-catalyzing enzymes precede downstream enzymes' evolution post Î³ whole-genome triplication, which occurred approximately 110 Mya in O. pumila, and before the whole-genome duplication in Camptotheca acuminata identified here. Combining comparative genome analysis, multi-omics analysis, and metabolic gene-cluster analysis, we propose a working model for MIA evolution, and a pangenome for MIA biosynthesis, which will help in establishing a sustainable supplyÂ of camptothecin.",

The foundation of this work is an improved representation of natural product metabolism in UniProtKB using Rhea, an expert-curated knowledgebase of biochemical reactions, that is built on the ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) ontology of small molecules. Knowledge of natural products and precursors is captured in ChEBI, enzyme-catalyzed reactions in Rhea, and enzymes in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, thereby linking chemical structure data directly to protein knowledge. We provide a practical demonstration of how users can search UniProtKB for protein knowledge relevant to natural products through interactive or programmatic queries using metabolite names and synonyms, chemical identifiers, chemical classes, and chemical structures and show how to federate UniProtKB with other data and knowledge resources and tools using semantic web technologies such as RDF and SPARQL.

        "pmc_abstract": "The limited bioavailability of plant-derived natural products with anticancer activity poses major challenges to the pharmaceutical industry. An example of this is camptothecin, a monoterpene indole alkaloid with potent anticancer activity that is extracted at very low concentrations from woody plants. Recently, camptothecin biosynthesis has been shown to become biotechnologically amenable in hairy-root systems of the natural producer Ophiorrhiza pumila. Here, time-course expression and metabolite analyses were performed to identify novel transcriptional regulators of camptothecin biosynthesis in O. pumila. It is shown here that camptothecin production increased over cultivation time and that the expression pattern of the WRKY transcription factor encoding gene OpWRKY2 is closely correlated with camptothecin accumulation. Overexpression of OpWRKY2 led to a more than three-fold increase in camptothecin levels. Accordingly, silencing of OpWRKY2 correlated with decreased camptothecin levels in the plant. Further detailed molecular characterization by electrophoretic mobility shift, yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays showed that OpWRKY2 directly binds and activates the central camptothecin pathway gene OpTDC. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that OpWRKY2 acts as a direct positive regulator of camptothecin biosynthesis. As such, a feasible strategy for the over-accumulation of camptothecin in a biotechnologically amenable system is presented.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Genome mining for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) has become an integral part of natural product discovery. The >200,000Â microbial genomes now publicly available hold information on abundant novel chemistry. One way to navigate this vast genomic diversity is through comparative analysis of homologous BGCs, which allows identification of cross-species patterns that can be matched to the presence of metabolites or biological activities. However, current tools are hindered by a bottleneck caused by the expensive network-based approach used to group these BGCs into gene cluster families (GCFs).<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce BiG-SLiCE, a tool designed to cluster massive numbers of BGCs. By representing them in Euclidean space, BiG-SLiCE can group BGCs into GCFs in a non-pairwise, near-linear fashion. We used BiG-SLiCE to analyze 1,225,071 BGCs collected from 209,206 publicly available microbial genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes within 10 days on a typical 36-core CPU server. We demonstrate the utility of such analyses by reconstructing a global map of secondary metabolic diversity across taxonomy to identify uncharted biosynthetic potential. BiG-SLiCE also provides a \"query mode\" that can efficiently place newly sequenced BGCs into previously computed GCFs, plus a powerful output visualization engine that facilitates user-friendly data exploration.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BiG-SLiCE opens up new possibilities to accelerate natural product discovery and offers a first step towards constructing a global and searchable interconnected network of BGCs. As more genomes are sequenced from understudied taxa, more information can be mined to highlight their potentially novel chemistry. BiG-SLiCE is available via https://github.com/medema-group/bigslice.",

Many antibiotics originate from natural products produced by various microorganisms. Over the last decades, bioinformatical approaches have facilitated the discovery and characterization of these small compounds using genome mining methodologies. A key part of this process is the identification of the most promising biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which encode novel natural products. In 2017, the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS) was developed in order to enable an automated target-directed genome mining approach. ARTS identifies possible resistant target genes within antibiotic gene clusters, in order to detect promising BGCs encoding antibiotics with novel modes of action. Although ARTS can predict promising targets based on multiple criteria, it provides little information about the cluster structures of possible resistant genes. Here, we present SYN-view. Based on a phylogenetic approach, SYN-view allows for easy comparison of gene clusters of interest and distinguishing genes with regular housekeeping functions from genes functioning as antibiotic resistant targets. Our aim is to implement our proposed method into the ARTS web-server, further improving the target-directed genome mining strategy of the ARTS pipeline.",

It encodes a diverse array of virulence factors for adhesion, cytotoxicity, and innate immune evasion, but these are less diverse than those encoded by <i>S. aureus</i> It expresses an iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) system combined with a novel energy-coupling factor (ECF) mechanism for extracting heme from hemoproteins. Small cytolytic <i>S. lugdunensis</i> synergistic hemolysins (SLUSH), peptides related to phenol-soluble modulins of <i>S. aureus</i>, act synergistically with Î²-toxin to lyse erythrocytes. <i>S. lugdunensis</i> expresses a novel peptide antibiotic, lugdunin, that can influence the nasal and skin microbiota. Endovascular infections are initiated by bacterial adherence to fibrinogen promoted by a homologue of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> clumping factor A and to von Willebrand factor on damaged endothelium by an uncharacterized mechanism. <i>S. lugdunensis</i> survives within mature phagolysosomes of macrophages without growing and is released only following apoptosis. This differs fundamentally from <i>S. aureus</i>, which actively grows and expresses bicomponent leukotoxins that cause membrane damage and could contribute to survival in the infected host. <i>S. lugdunensis</i> is being investigated as a probiotic to eradicate <i>S. aureus</i> from the nares of carriers. However, this is contraindicated by its innate virulence. Studies to obtain a deeper understanding of <i>S. lugdunensis</i> colonization, virulence, and microbiome interactions are therefore warranted.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Mitochondria are important places for eukaryotes to carry out energy metabolism and participate in the processes of cell differentiation, cell information transmission, and cell apoptosis. Autophagy is a programmed intracellular degradation process. Mitophagy, as a selective autophagy, is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process to eliminate dysfunctional or redundant mitochondria, thereby fine-tuning the number of mitochondria and maintaining energy metabolism. Many stimuli could activate mitophagy to regulate related physiological processes, which could ultimately reduce or aggravate the damage caused by stimulation. Stroke is a common disease that seriously affects the health and lives of people around the world, and ischemic stroke, which is caused by cerebral vascular stenosis or obstruction, accounts for the vast majority of stroke. Abnormal mitophagy is closely related to the occurrence, development and pathological mechanism of ischemic stroke. However, the exact mechanism of mitophagy involved in ischemic stroke has not been fully elucidated. In this review, we discuss the process and signal pathways of mitophagy, the potential role of mitophagy in ischemic stroke and the possible signal transduction pathways. It will help deepen the understanding of mitophagy and provide new ideas for the treatment of ischemic stroke.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Chelocardin (CHD) exhibits a broad-spectrum antibiotic activity and showed promising results in a small phase II clinical study conducted on patients with urinary tract infections. Importantly, CHD was shown to be active also against tetracycline-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, which is gaining even more importance in today's antibiotic crisis. We have demonstrated that modifications of CHD through genetic engineering of its producer, the actinomycete Amycolatopsis sulphurea, are not only possible but yielded even more potent antibiotics than CHD itself, like 2-carboxamido-2-deacetyl-chelocardin (CD-CHD), which is currently in preclinical evaluation. A. sulphurea is difficult to genetically manipulate and therefore manipulation of the chd biosynthetic gene cluster in a genetically amenable heterologous host would be of high importance for further drug-discovery efforts.<h4>Results</h4>We report heterologous expression of the CHD biosynthetic gene cluster in the model organism Streptomyces albus del14 strain. Unexpectedly, we found that the originally defined CHD gene cluster fails to provide all genes required for CHD formation, including an additional cyclase and two regulatory genes. Overexpression of the putative pathway-specific streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein chdB in A. sulphurea resulted in an increase of both, CHD and CD-CHD production. Applying a metabolic-engineering approach, it was also possible to generate the potent CHD analogue, CD-CHD in S. albus. Finally, an additional yield increase was achieved in S. albus del14 by in-trans overexpression of the chdR exporter gene, which provides resistance to CHD and CDCHD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We identified previously unknown genes in the CHD cluster, which were shown to be essential for chelocardin biosynthesis by expression of the full biosynthetic gene cluster in S. albus as heterologous host. When comparing to oxytetracycline biosynthesis, we observed that the CHD gene cluster contains additional enzymes not found in gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of typical tetracyclines (such as oxytetracycline). This finding probably explains the different chemistries and modes of action, which make CHD/CD-CHD valuable lead structures for clinical candidates. Even though the CHD genes are derived from a rare actinomycete A. sulphurea, the yield of CHD in the heterologous host was very good. The corrected nucleotide sequence of the CHD gene cluster now contains all gene products required for the production of CHD in a genetically amenable heterologous host, thus opening new possibilities towards production of novel and potent tetracycline analogues with a new mode of action.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Lugdunin is the first reported nonribosomally synthesized antibiotic from human microbiomes. Its production by the commensal <i>Staphylococcus lugdunensis</i> eliminates the pathogen <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> from human nasal microbiomes. The cycloheptapeptide lugdunin is the founding member of the new class of fibupeptide antibiotics, which have a novel mode of action and represent promising new antimicrobial agents. How <i>S. lugdunensis</i> releases and achieves producer self-resistance to lugdunin has remained unknown. We report that two ABC transporters encoded upstream of the lugdunin-biosynthetic operon have distinct yet overlapping roles in lugdunin secretion and self-resistance. While deletion of the <i>lugEF</i> transporter genes abrogated most of the lugdunin secretion, the <i>lugGH</i> transporter genes had a dominant role in resistance. Yet all four genes were required for full-level lugdunin resistance. The small accessory putative membrane protein LugI further contributed to lugdunin release and resistance levels conferred by the ABC transporters. Whereas LugIEFGH also conferred resistance to lugdunin congeners with inverse structures or with amino acid exchange at position 6, they neither affected the susceptibility to a lugdunin variant with an exchange at position 2 nor to other cyclic peptide antimicrobials such as daptomycin or gramicidin S. The obvious selectivity of the resistance mechanism raises hopes that it will not confer cross-resistance to other antimicrobials or to optimized lugdunin derivatives to be used for the prevention and treatment of <i>S. aureus</i> infections.",

The discovery of novel molecules from these organisms is, however, hindered because most of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding these secondary metabolites are cryptic or silent and are referred to as orphan BGCs. While co-culture has proven to be a promising approach to unlock the biosynthetic potential of many microorganisms by activating the expression of these orphan BGCs, it still remains an underexplored technique. The marine actinobacterium Salinispora tropica, for instance, produces valuable compounds such as the anti-cancer molecule salinosporamide but half of its putative BGCs are still orphan. Although previous studies have used marine heterotrophs to induce orphan BGCs in Salinispora, its co-culture with marine phototrophs has yet to be investigated. Following the observation of an antimicrobial activity against a range of phytoplankton by S.Â tropica, we here report that the photosynthate released by photosynthetic primary producers influences its biosynthetic capacities with production of cryptic molecules and the activation of orphan BGCs. Our work, using an approach combining metabolomics and proteomics, pioneers the use of phototrophs as a promising strategy to accelerate the discovery of novel natural products from marine actinobacteria.",

Besides that, this allows the targeting of competitors, also filling a protective role, reducing the chance of self-killing. Surprisingly, DNA-degrading and membrane damaging prodiginines (PdGs) are only produced intracellularly, and are required for the onset of the second round of programmed cell death (PCD) in <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i>. In this work, we investigated the influence of PdGs on the timing of the morphological differentiation of <i>S. coelicolor</i>. The deletion of the transcriptional activator gene <i>redD</i> that activates the <i>red</i> cluster for PdGs or nutrient-mediated reduction of PdG synthesis both resulted in the precocious appearance of mature spore chains. Transcriptional analysis revealed an accelerated expression of key developmental genes in the <i>redD</i> null mutant, including <i>bldN</i> for the developmental Ï factor BldN which is essential for aerial mycelium formation. In contrast, PdG overproduction due to the enhanced copy number of <i>redD</i> resulted in a delay or block in sporulation. In addition, confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that the earliest aerial hyphae do not produce PdGs. This suggests that filaments that eventually differentiate into spore chains and are hence required for survival of the colony, are excluded from the second round of PCD induced by PdGs. We propose that one of the roles of PdGs would be to delay the entrance of <i>S. coelicolor</i> into the dormancy state (sporulation) by inducing the leakage of the intracellular content of dying filaments thereby providing nutrients for the survivors.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Pantoea ananatis</i> is the primary cause of onion center rot. Genetic data suggest that a phosphonic acid natural product is required for pathogenesis; however, the nature of the molecule is unknown. Here, we show that <i>P. ananatis</i> produces at least three phosphonates, two of which were purified and structurally characterized. The first, designated pantaphos, was shown to be 2-(hydroxy[phosphono]methyl)maleate; the second, a probable biosynthetic precursor, was shown to be 2-(phosphonomethyl)maleate. Purified pantaphos is both necessary and sufficient for the hallmark lesions of onion center rot. Moreover, when tested against mustard seedlings, the phytotoxic activity of pantaphos was comparable to the widely used herbicides glyphosate and phosphinothricin. Pantaphos was also active against a variety of human cell lines but was significantly more toxic to glioblastoma cells. Pantaphos showed little activity when tested against a variety of bacteria and fungi.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Pantoea ananatis</i> is a significant plant pathogen that targets a number of important crops, a problem that is compounded by the absence of effective treatments to prevent its spread. Our identification of pantaphos as the key virulence factor in onion center rot suggests a variety of approaches that could be employed to address this significant plant disease. Moreover, the general phytotoxicity of the molecule suggests that it could be developed into an effective herbicide to counter the alarming rise in herbicide-resistant weeds.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Norvancomycin has been widely used in clinic to treat against MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and MRSE (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis) infections in China. Amycolatopsis orientalis NCPC 2-48, a high yield strain derived from A. orientalis CPCC 200066, has been applied in industrial large-scale production of norvancomycin by North China Pharmaceutical Group. However, the potential high-yield and regulatory mechanism involved in norvancomycin biosynthetic pathway has not yet been addressed.<h4>Results</h4>Here we sequenced and compared the genomes and transcriptomes of A. orientalis CPCC 200066 and NCPC 2-48. These two genomes are extremely similar with an identity of more than 99.9%, and no duplication and structural variation was found in the norvancomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Comparative transcriptomic analysis indicated that biosynthetic genes of norvancomycin, as well as some primary metabolite pathways for the biosynthetic precursors of norvancomycin were generally upregulated. AoStrR1 and AoLuxR1, two cluster-situated regulatory genes in norvancomycin cluster, were 23.3-fold and 5.8-fold upregulated in the high yield strain at 48Â h, respectively. Over-expression of AoStrR1 and AoLuxR1 in CPCC 200066 resulted in an increase of norvancomycin production, indicating their positive roles in norvancomycin biosynthesis. Furthermore, AoStrR1 can regulate the production of norvancomycin by directly interacting with at least 8 promoters of norvancomycin biosynthetic genes or operons.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results suggested that the high yield of NCPC 2-48 can be ascribed to increased expression level of norvancomycin biosynthetic genes in its cluster as well as the genes responsible for the supply of its precursors. The norvancomycin biosynthetic genes are presumably regulated by AoStrR1 and AoLuxR1, of them AoStrR1 is possibly the ultimate pathway-specific regulator for the norvancomycin production. These results are helpful for further clarification of the holistic and pathway-specific regulatory mechanism of norvancomycin biosynthesis in the industrial production strain.",

A significant amount of research has been focused on the biology, morphology, systematics, and taxonomy of this group, with less of a focus on molecular or biochemical issues. Early and extensive research on these fungi focused on taxonomy and their classification based on in vivo features. Lately, investigations have mainly addressed a combination of characteristics such as morphological traits, host specificity, and molecular analyses initiated at the end of the 20th century. Some species that are important from an economic point of view have been more intensively investigated by means of genetic and biochemical methods to better understand the pathogenesis processes. Cercosporin, a photoactivated toxin playing an important role in <i>Cercospora</i> diseases, has been extensively studied. Understanding cercosporin toxicity in relation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production facilitated the discovery and regulation of the cercosporin biosynthesis pathway, including the gene cluster encoding pathway enzymes. Furthermore, these fungi may be a source of other biotechnologically important compounds, e.g., industrially relevant enzymes.

        "pmc_abstract": "Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are operonic sets of microbial genes that synthesize specialized metabolites with diverse functions, including siderophores and antibiotics, which often require export to the extracellular environment. For this reason, genes for transport across cellular membranes are essential for the production of specialized metabolites and are often genomically colocalized with BGCs. Here, we conducted a comprehensive computational analysis of transporters associated with characterized BGCs. In addition to known exporters, in BGCs we found many importer-specific transmembrane domains that co-occur with substrate binding proteins possibly for uptake of siderophores or metabolic precursors. Machine learning models using transporter gene frequencies were predictive of known siderophore activity, molecular weights, and a measure of lipophilicity (log <i>P</i>) for corresponding BGC-synthesized metabolites. Transporter genes associated with BGCs were often equally or more predictive of metabolite features than biosynthetic genes. Given the importance of siderophores as pathogenicity factors, we used transporters specific for siderophore BGCs to identify both known and uncharacterized siderophore-like BGCs in genomes from metagenomes from the infant and adult gut microbiome. We find that 23% of microbial genomes from premature infant guts have siderophore-like BGCs, but only 3% of those assembled from adult gut microbiomes do. Although siderophore-like BGCs from the infant gut are predominantly associated with Enterobacteriaceae and <i>Staphylococcus</i>, siderophore-like BGCs can be identified from taxa in the adult gut microbiome that have rarely been recognized for siderophore production. Taken together, these results show that consideration of BGC-associated transporter genes can inform predictions of specialized metabolite structure and function.",

However, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by bacteria is often silenced under laboratory conditions, limiting the controlled expression of natural products. Here we describe an integrated methodology for the construction and screening of an elicited and pre-fractionated library of marine bacteria. In this pilot study, chemical elicitors were evaluated to mimic the natural environment and to induce the expression of cryptic BGCs in deep-sea bacteria. By integrating high-resolution untargeted metabolomics with cheminformatics analyses, it was possible to visualize, mine, identify and map the chemical and biological space of the elicited bacterial metabolites. The results show that elicited bacterial metabolites correspond to ~45% of the compounds produced under laboratory conditions. In addition, the elicited chemical space is novel (~70% of the elicited compounds) or concentrated in the chemical space of drugs. Fractionation of the crude extracts further evidenced minor compounds (~90% of the collection) and the detection of biological activity. This pilot work pinpoints strategies for constructing and evaluating chemically diverse bacterial natural product libraries towards the identification of novel bacterial metabolites in natural product-based drug discovery pipelines.",

An important step toward the goal of understanding functional ecological interactions and their evolutionary selection is the study of increasingly complex microbial interaction systems. Here, we discovered a tripartite biosystem consisting of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the algicidal bacterium Streptomyces iranensis. Genetic analyses and MALDI-IMS demonstrate that the bacterium secretes the algicidal compound azalomycin F upon contact with C. reinhardtii. In co-culture, A. nidulans attracts the motile alga C. reinhardtii, which becomes embedded and surrounded by fungal mycelium and is shielded from the algicide. The filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospora was susceptible to azalomycin F and failed to protect C. reinhardtii despite chemotactically attracting the alga. Because S. macrospora was susceptible to azalomycin F, this data imply that for protection the fungus needs to be resistant. Formation of the lichen-like association between C. reinhardtii and A. nidulans increased algal growth. The protection depends on the increased amounts of membrane lipids provided by resistant fungi, thereby generating a protective shelter against the bacterial toxin. Our findings reveal a strategy whereby algae survive lethal environmental algicides through cooperation with fungi.",

AmpDh2 is a periplasmic soluble enzyme with the former anchored to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane.

AmpDh3 hydrolyzes the cell wall peptidoglycan of the prey bacterium, which leads to its killing, thereby providing a growth advantage for P. aeruginosa in bacterial competition.

        "pmc_abstract": "We recently discovered that 6-thioguanine (6-TG) is an antivirulence compound that is produced by a number of coagulase-negative staphylococci. In Staphylococcus aureus, it inhibits <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthesis and ribosomal protein expression, thus inhibiting growth and abrogating toxin production. Mechanisms by which S. aureus may develop resistance to this compound are currently unknown. Here, we show that 6-TG-resistant S. aureus mutants emerge spontaneously when the bacteria are subjected to high concentrations of 6-TG <i>in vitro</i>. Whole-genome sequencing of these mutants revealed frameshift and missense mutations in a xanthine-uracil permease family protein (<i>stgP</i> [<u>s</u>ix <u>t</u>hio<u>g</u>uanine <u>p</u>ermease]) and single nucleotide polymorphisms in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (<i>hpt</i>). These mutations engender S. aureus the ability to resist both the growth inhibitory and toxin downregulation effects of 6-TG. While prophylactic administration of 6-TG ameliorates necrotic lesions in subcutaneous infection of mice with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain USA300 LAC, the drug did not reduce lesion size formed by the 6-TG-resistant strains. These findings identify mechanisms of 6-TG resistance, and this information can be leveraged to inform strategies to slow the evolution of resistance.",

Predatory myxobacteria are ubiquitous to a variety of microbial habitats and capably consume a broad diversity of microbial prey. Predator-prey experiments utilizing myxobacteria have provided details into predatory mechanisms and features that facilitate consumption of prey. However, prey resistance to myxobacterial predation remains underexplored, and prey resistances have been observed exclusively from predator-prey experiments that included the model myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus. Utilizing a predator-prey pairing that instead included the myxobacterium, Cystobacter ferrugineus, with Pseudomonas putida as prey, we observed surviving phenotypes capable of eluding predation. Comparative transcriptomics between P. putida unexposed to C. ferrugineus and the survivor phenotype suggested that increased expression of efflux pumps, genes associated with mucoid conversion, and various membrane features contribute to predator avoidance. Unique features observed from the survivor phenotype when compared to the parent P. putida include small colony variation, efflux-mediated antibiotic resistance, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid production, and increased mucoid conversion. These results demonstrate the utility of myxobacterial predator-prey models and provide insight into prey resistances in response to predatory stress that might contribute to the phenotypic diversity and structure of bacterial communities.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Many poisonous organisms carry small-molecule toxins that alter voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV) function. Among these, batrachotoxin (BTX) from Pitohui poison birds and Phyllobates poison frogs stands out because of its lethality and unusual effects on NaV function. How these toxin-bearing organisms avoid autointoxication remains poorly understood. In poison frogs, a NaV DIVS6 pore-forming helix N-to-T mutation has been proposed as the BTX resistance mechanism. Here, we show that this variant is absent from Pitohui and poison frog NaVs, incurs a strong cost compromising channel function, and fails to produce BTX-resistant channels in poison frog NaVs. We also show that captivity-raised poison frogs are resistant to two NaV-directed toxins, BTX and saxitoxin (STX), even though they bear NaVs sensitive to both. Moreover, we demonstrate that the amphibian STX \"toxin sponge\" protein saxiphilin is able to protect and rescue NaVs from block by STX. Taken together, our data contradict the hypothesis that BTX autoresistance is rooted in the DIVS6 NâT mutation, challenge the idea that ion channel mutations are a primary driver of toxin resistance, and suggest the possibility that toxin sequestration mechanisms may be key for protecting poisonous species from the action of small-molecule toxins.",

The study aims to describe the genomic characteristics of methicillin-resistant <i>S. epidermidis</i> (MRSE) isolated from clinical sources, to comprehend the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance, virulence, and potential pathogenicity. Sixteen MRSE underwent whole-genome sequencing, and bioinformatics analyses were carried out to ascertain their resistome, virulome, mobilome, clonality, and phylogenomic relationships. In all, 75% of isolates displayed multidrug resistance and were associated with the carriage of multiple resistance genes including <i>mecA</i>, <i>blaZ</i>, <i>tet(K)</i>, <i>erm(A)</i>, <i>erm(B)</i>, <i>erm(C)</i>, <i>dfrG</i>, <i>aac(6')-aph(2'')</i>, and <i>cat(pC221)</i> conferring resistance to Î²-lactams, tetracyclines, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B, aminoglycosides, and phenicols, which were located on both plasmids and chromosomes.

The community-acquired SCC<i>mec</i> type IV was the most common SCC<i>mec</i> type. The CoNS belonged to seven multilocus sequence types (MLSTs) and carried a diversity of mobile genetic elements such as phages, insertion sequences, and plasmids. The bacterial anti-phage defense systems clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) immunity phage system and restriction-modification system (R-M system) and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) involved in immune evasion and transport of virulence genes were also found. The insertion sequence, IS256, linked with virulence, was found in 56.3% of isolates. Generally, the isolates clustered according to STs, with some similarity but also considerable variability within isolates.

In this study, a slow-growing <i>Streptomyces</i> strain expressing unique genomic and phenotypic characteristics, P38-E01 <sup><i>T</i></sup> , was described using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. This strain is part of a collection of over 8,000 marine Actinobacteria isolates collected in the Trondheim fjord of Norway by SINTEF Industry (Trondheim, Norway) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU, Trondheim, Norway). Strain P38-E01 <sup><i>T</i></sup> was isolated from the sediments of the Trondheim fjord, and phylogenetic analyses affiliated this strain with the genus <i>Streptomyces</i>, but it was not closely affiliated with other described species. The closest related type strains were <i>Streptomyces daliensis</i> YIM 31724 <sup><i>T</i></sup> (98.6%), <i>Streptomyces rimosus</i> subsp. <i>rimosus</i> ATCC 10970 <sup><i>T</i></sup> (98.4%), and <i>Streptomyces sclerotialus</i> NRRL ISP-5269 <sup><i>T</i></sup> (98.3%). Predominant fatty acids were C<sub>16:0</sub> iso, C<sub>16:0</sub>, and Summed Feature 3, and the predominant respiratory quinones were MK-10(H<sub>6</sub>), MK-10(H<sub>4</sub>), and MK9(H<sub>4</sub>). The main polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphoglycolipid. The whole-cell sugars were glucose, ribose, and in minor amounts, mannose. The cell wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid. The draft genome has a size of 6.16 Mb, with a %G + C content of 71.4% and is predicted to contain at least 19 biosynthetic gene clusters encoding diverse secondary metabolites. Strain P38-E01 <sup><i>T</i></sup> was found to inhibit the growth of the pathogenic yeast <i>Candida albicans</i> ATCC 90028 and a number of Gram-positive bacterial human and plant pathogens. Metabolites extracted from cultures of P38-E01 <sup><i>T</i></sup> were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and it was found that the isolate produced the antifungal compound candicidin. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic signatures, along with phylogenetic analyses, distinguished isolate P38-E01 <sup><i>T</i></sup> from its closest neighbors; thus, this isolate represents a novel species of the genus <i>Streptomyces</i> for which the name <i>Streptomyces tardus</i> sp. nov.

The present study aimed to develop functional drinks by the fermentation of buttermilk and soymilk preparations using the <i>Pediococcus acidilactici</i> BD16 (<i>alaD</i><sup>+</sup>) strain expressing the L-alanine dehydrogenase enzyme. LAB fermentation was carried out for 24 h and its impact on the physicochemical and quality attributes of the fermented drinks was evaluated. Levels of total antioxidants, phenolics, flavonoids, and especially L-alanine enhanced significantly after LAB fermentation. Further, GC-MS-based metabolomic fingerprinting was performed to identify the presence of bioactive metabolites such as 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1-dodecene, 2-aminononadecane, 3-octadecene, 4-octen-3-one, acetic acid, azanonane, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, chloroacetic acid, colchicine, heptadecanenitrile, hexadecanal, quercetin, and triacontane, which could be accountable for the improvement of organoleptic attributes and health benefits of the drinks. Meanwhile, the levels of certain undesirable metabolites such as 1-pentadecene, 2-bromopropionic acid, 8-heptadecene, formic acid, and propionic acid, which impart bitterness, rancidity, and unpleasant odor to the fermented drinks, were reduced considerably after LAB fermentation.

During this process, an apparently redundant methyltransferase Art28 was characterized as a malonyl-acyl carrier protein O-methyltransferase, which represents an unusual on-line methyl esterification initiation strategy for polyketide biosynthesis. The methyl ester bond introduced by Art28 is kept until the last step of ART biosynthesis, in which it is hydrolyzed by Art9 to convert inactive ART 9B to active ART B. The cryptic reactions catalyzed by Art28 and Art9 represent a protecting group biosynthetic logic to render the ART carboxyl terminus inert to unwanted side reactions and to protect producing organisms from toxic ART intermediates.

        "pmc_abstract": "Blasticidin S is a peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic. Its biosynthesis involves a cryptic leucylation and two leucylated intermediates, LDBS and LBS, have been found in previous studies. Leucylation has been proposed to be a new self-resistance mechanism during blasticidin S biosynthesis, and the leucyl group was found to be important for the methylation of Î²-amino group of the arginine side chain. However, the responsible enzyme and its associated mechanism of the leucyl transfer process remain to be elucidated. Here, we report results investigating the leucyl transfer step forming the intermediate LDBS in blasticidin biosynthesis. A hypothetical protein, BlsK, has been characterized by genetic and in vitro biochemical experiments. This enzyme catalyzes the leucyl transfer from leucyl-transfer RNA (leucyl-tRNA) to the Î²-amino group on the arginine side chain of DBS. Furthermore, BlsK was found to contain an iron-sulfur cluster that is necessary for activity. These findings provide an example of an iron-sulfur protein that catalyzes an aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA)-dependent amide bond formation in a natural product biosynthetic pathway.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Secondary metabolites are key components in microbial ecology by mediating interactions between bacteria and their environment, neighboring species or host organisms. Bioactivities can be beneficial for both interaction partners or provide a competitive advantage only for the producer. Colonizers of confined habitats such as biofilms are known as prolific producers of a great number of bioactive secondary metabolites and are a potential source for novel compounds. We investigated the strain <i>Paracoccus marcusii</i> CP157, which originates from the biofilm on the carapace of a shell disease-affected <i>Cancer pagurus</i> specimen, for its potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites. Its closed genome contains 22 extrachromosomal elements and several gene clusters potentially involved in biosynthesis of bioactive polyketides, bacteriocins, and non-ribosomal peptides. Culture extracts of CP157 showed antagonistic activities against bacteria from different phyla, but also against microalgae and crustacean larvae. Different HPLC-fractions of CP157 culture extracts had antibacterial properties, indicating that several bioactive compounds are produced by CP157. The bioactive extract contains several small, antibacterial compounds that partially withstand elevated temperatures, extreme pH values and exposure to proteolytic enzymes, providing high stability toward environmental conditions in the natural habitat of CP157. Further, screening of 17 <i>Paracoccus</i> spp. revealed that antimicrobial activity, hemolysis and production of <i>N</i>-acyl homoserine lactones are common features within the genus. Taking into account the large habitat diversity and phylogenetic distance of the tested strains, we hypothesize that bioactive secondary metabolites play a central role in the ecology of <i>Paracoccus</i> spp. in their natural environments.",

While traditional approaches focused on morphology, 16S gene sequences, and biochemistry, modern methods including comparative genomics have provided a more thorough assessment of myxobacterial taxonomy. Herein, we utilize long-read genome sequencing for two myxobacteria previously classified as <i>Archangium primigenium</i> and <i>Chondrococcus macrosporus</i>, as well as four environmental myxobacteria newly isolated for this study. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization scores from comparative genomics suggest previously classified as <i>A. primigenium</i> to instead be a novel member of the genus <i>Melittangium</i>, <i>C. macrosporus</i> to be a potentially novel member of the genus <i>Corallococcus</i> with high similarity to <i>Corallococcus exercitus</i>, and the four isolated myxobacteria to include another novel <i>Corallococcus</i> species, a novel <i>Pyxidicoccus</i> species, a strain of <i>Corallococcus exiguus</i>, and a potentially novel <i>Myxococcus</i> species with high similarity to <i>Myxococcus stipitatus</i>. We assess the biosynthetic potential of each sequenced myxobacterium and suggest that genus-level conservation of biosynthetic pathways support our preliminary taxonomic assignment.

Unlike known monoterpene indole alkaloids, CPT in C. acuminata is biosynthesized via the key intermediate strictosidinic acid, but how O. pumila synthesizes CPT has not been determined.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we used nontargeted metabolite profiling to show that 3Î±-(S)-strictosidine and 3-(S), 21-(S)-strictosidinic acid coexist in O. pumila. After identifying the enzymes OpLAMT, OpSLS, and OpSTR as participants in CPT biosynthesis, we compared these enzymes to their homologues from two other representative CPT-producing plants, C. acuminata and Nothapodytes nimmoniana, to elucidate their phylogenetic relationship. Finally, using labelled intermediates to resolve the CPT biosynthesis pathway in O. pumila, we showed that 3Î±-(S)-strictosidine, not 3-(S), 21-(S)-strictosidinic acid, is the exclusive intermediate in CPT biosynthesis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In our study, we found that O. pumila, another representative CPT-producing plant, exhibits metabolite diversity in its central intermediates consisting of both 3-(S), 21-(S)-strictosidinic acid and 3Î±-(S)-strictosidine and utilizes 3Î±-(S)-strictosidine as the exclusive intermediate in the CPT biosynthetic pathway, which differs from C. acuminata. Our results show that enzymes likely to be involved in CPT biosynthesis in O. pumila, C. acuminata, and N. nimmoniana have evolved divergently. Overall, our new data regarding CPT biosynthesis in O. pumila suggest evolutionary divergence in CPT-producing plants. These results shed new light on CPT biosynthesis and pave the way towards its industrial production through enzymatic or metabolic engineering approaches.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Monascus-</i>type azaphilone pigments (MonAzPs) are produced in multi-thousand ton quantities each year and used as food colorants and nutraceuticals in East Asia. Several groups, including ours, described MonAzPs biosynthesis as a highly complex pathway with many branch points, affording more than 110 MonAzP congeners in a small group of fungi in the Eurotiales order. MonAzPs biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are also very complex and mosaic-like, with some genes involved in more than one pathway, while other genes playing no apparent role in MonAzPs production. Due to this complexity, MonAzPs BGCs have been delimited differently in various fungi. Since most of these predictions rely primarily on bioinformatic analyses, it is possible that genes immediately outside the currently predicted BGC borders are also involved, especially those whose function cannot be predicted from sequence similarities alone. Conversely, some peripheral genes presumed to be part of the BGC may in fact lay outside the boundaries. This study uses a combination of computational and transcriptional analyses to predict the extent of the MonAzPs BGC in <i>Monascus ruber</i> M7. Gene knockouts and analysis of MonAzPs production of the mutants are then used to validate the prediction, revealing that the BGC consists of 16 genes, extending from <i>mrpigA</i> to <i>mrpigP</i>. We further predict that two strains of <i>Talaromyces marneffei</i>, ATCC 18224 and PM1, encode an orthologous but non-syntenic MonAzPs BGC with 14 genes. This work highlights the need to use comprehensive, integrated approaches for the more precise determination of secondary metabolite BGC boundaries.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The genomic era has dramatically changed how we discover and investigate microbial biochemistry. In particular, the exponential expansion in the number of sequenced microbial genomes provides investigators with a vast wealth of sequence data to exploit for the discovery of biochemical functions and mechanisms, as well as novel enzymes and metabolites. In contrast to early biochemical work, which was largely characterized by \"forward\" approaches that proceed from biomass to enzyme to gene, the availability of genome sequences enables the discovery of new microbial metabolic activities, enzymes, and metabolites by \"reverse\" approaches that originate with genetic information or by approaches that incorporate features of both forward and reverse methodologies. In the genomic era, the canonical organization of microbial genomes into gene clusters presents a singular opportunity for the utilization of genomic data. Specifically, genomic context (information gleaned from the genes surrounding a gene of interest in the chromosome) is a powerful tool for chemical discovery in microbial systems because of the functional and/or physiological relationship that usually exists between genes found within a gene cluster. This means that the investigator can use this inferred link to generate hypotheses about the functions of individual genes in the cluster or even the function of the entire cluster itself. Here, we discuss how analysis of genomic context in combination with a mechanistic understanding of enzymes can facilitate numerous facets of microbial biochemical research including the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters, the discovery of important and novel enzymes, the elucidation of natural product structures, and the identification of new metabolic pathways. We highlight work from our laboratory using genomic context to discover and study biosynthetic pathways that produce natural products, including the cylindrocyclophanes, nitrogen-nitrogen bond-containing metabolites, and the gut microbial genotoxin colibactin. Although use of genomic context is most commonly associated with studies of natural product biosynthesis, we also show that it can be applied to the study of primary metabolism. We illustrate this with examples from our work studying the members of the glycyl radical enzyme superfamily involved in choline and 4-hydroxyproline degradation in the human gut. Looking forward, we envision increased opportunities to use such information, with the combination of biochemical knowledge and computational tools poised to fuel a new revolution in our ability to connect genes and their biochemical functions. In particular, we note a need for methods that computationally formalize the functional association between genes when such associations are not obvious from manual gene annotations. Such tools will drastically augment the feasibility and scope of gene cluster analysis and accelerate the discovery of new microbial enzymes, metabolites, and metabolic processes.",

Two bacteria exhibiting Txn-degrading activity were isolated from healthy rice seeds and identified as Sphingomonas adhaesiva and Agrobacterium sp. respectively. The genes stdR and stdA, encoding proteins responsible for Txn degradation of both bacterial isolates, were identical, indicating that horizontal gene transfer occurred between microbial communities in the same ecosystem. We identified a novel Txn-quenching regulation of bacteria, demonstrating that the LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) StdR induces the expression of the stdA, which encodes a Txn-degrading enzyme, in the presence of Txn as a coinducer. Here we show that the bacterial StdR<sup>Txn</sup> -quenching regulatory system mimics the ToxR<sup>Txn</sup> -mediated biosynthetic regulation of B. glumae. Substrate specificity investigations revealed that Txn is the only coinducer of StdR and that StdA has a high degree of specificity for Txn. Rice plants expressing StdA showed Txn resistance. Collectively, bacteria mimic the mechanism of Txn biosynthesis regulation, employ it in the development of a Txn-quenching regulatory system and share it with neighbouring bacteria for survival in rice environments full of Txn.",

Chemically modified into imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin), now one of the most clinically important antibiotics, thienamycin is encoded by a thienamycin gene cluster composed of 22 genes (thnA to thnV) from S. cattleya NRRL 8057 genome. Interestingly, the role of all thn-genes has been experimentally demonstrated in the thienamycin biosynthesis, except thnS, despite its annotation as putative Î²-lactamase. Here, we expressed thnS gene and investigated its activities against various substrates. Our analyses revealed that ThnS belonged to the superfamily of metallo-Î²-lactamase fold proteins. Compared to known Î²-lactamases such as OXA-48 and NDM-1, ThnS exhibited a lower affinity and less efficiency toward penicillin G and cefotaxime, while imipenem is more actively hydrolysed. Moreover, like most MBL fold enzymes, additional enzymatic activities of ThnS were detected such as hydrolysis of ascorbic acid, single strand DNA, and ribosomal RNA. ThnS appears as a MBL enzyme with multiple activities including a specialised Î²-lactamase activity toward imipenem. Thus, like toxin/antitoxin systems, the role of thnS gene within the thienamycin gene cluster appears as an antidote against the produced thienamycin.",

        "pmc_abstract": "While the effects of antibiotics on microorganisms are widely studied, it remains less well understood how antibiotics affect the physiology of the native producing organisms. Here, using a marine bacterium, <i>Photobacterium galatheae</i> S2753, that produces the antibiotic holomycin, we generated a holomycin-deficient strain by in-frame deletion of <i>hlmE</i>, the core gene responsible for holomycin production. Mass spectrometry analysis of cell extracts confirmed that the Î<i>hlmE</i> strain did not produce holomycin and that the mutant was devoid of antibacterial activity. Biofilm formation of the Î<i>hlmE</i> strain was significantly reduced compared to that of wild-type S2753 and was restored in an <i>hlmE</i> complementary mutant. Consistent with this, exogenous holomycin, but not its dimethylated and less antibacterial derivative, S,S'-dimethyl holomycin, restored the biofilm formation of the Î<i>hlmE</i> strain. Furthermore, zinc starvation was found to be essential for both holomycin production and biofilm formation of S2753, although the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Collectively, these data suggest that holomycin promotes biofilm formation of S2753 via its ene-disulfide group. Lastly, the addition of holomycin at subinhibitory concentrations also enhanced the biofilms of four other <i>Vibrionaceae</i> strains. <i>P. galatheae</i> likely gains an ecological advantage from producing holomycin as both an antibiotic and a biofilm stimulator, which facilitates nutrition acquisition and protects <i>P. galatheae</i> from environmental stresses. Studying the function of antibiotic compounds in the native producer will shed light on their roles in nature and could point to novel bioprospecting strategies.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Despite the societal impact of antibiotics, their ecological functions remain elusive and have mostly been studied by exposing nonproducing bacteria to subinhibitory concentrations. Here, we studied the effects of the antibiotic holomycin on its native producer, <i>Photobacterium galatheae</i> S2753, a <i>Vibrionaceae</i> bacterium. Holomycin provides a distinct advantage to S2753 both as an antibiotic and by enhancing biofilm formation in the producer. <i>Vibrionaceae</i> species successfully thrive in global marine ecosystems, where they play critical ecological roles as free-living, symbiotic, or pathogenic bacteria. Genome mining has demonstrated that many have the potential to produce several bioactive compounds, including <i>P. galatheae</i> To unravel the contribution of the microbial metabolites to the development of marine microbial ecosystems, better insight into the function of these compounds in the producing organisms is needed. Our finding provides a model to pursue this and highlights the ecological importance of antibiotics to the fitness of the producing organisms.",

Endophytic fungi internally colonize plant tissues and have the potential to act as control agents, such as biological agents or elicitors in the process of induced resistance and in attenuating abiotic stresses. In this review, we list the mode of action of this group of microorganisms which can act in controlling plant diseases and describe several examples in which endophytes were able to reduce the damage caused by pathogens and adverse conditions. This is due to their arsenal of molecules generated during the interaction by which they form a kind of biological shield in the plant. Furthermore, considering that endophytic fungi can be an important tool in managing for biotic and abiotic stresses due to the large amount of biologically active substances produced, bioprospecting this class of microorganisms is tending to increase and generate valuable products for agriculture.",

Different scenarios of <i>pks</i> acquisition were deduced from whole genome sequence and phylogenetic analysis. In the main scenario, <i>pks</i> was introduced and stabilized into certain sequence types (STs) of the B2 phylogroup, such as ST73 and ST95, at the <i>asnW</i> tRNA locus located in the vicinity of the yersiniabactin-encoding High Pathogenicity Island (HPI). In a few B2 strains, <i>pks</i> inserted at the <i>asnU</i> or <i>asnV</i> tRNA loci close to the HPI and occasionally was located next to the remnant of an integrative and conjugative element. In a last scenario specific to B1/A strains, <i>pks</i> was acquired, independently of the HPI, at a non-tRNA locus. All the <i>pks</i>-positive strains except 18 produced colibactin. Sixteen strains contained mutations in <i>clbB</i> or <i>clbD,</i> or a fusion of <i>clbJ</i> and <i>clbK</i> and were no longer genotoxic but most of them still produced low amounts of potentially active metabolites associated with the <i>pks</i> island. One strain was fully metabolically inactive without <i>pks</i> alteration, but colibactin production was restored by overexpressing the ClbR regulator. In conclusion, the <i>pks</i> island is not restricted to human pathogenic B2 strains and is more widely distributed in the <i>E. coli</i> population, while preserving its functionality.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Anaerobic fungi (class Neocallimastigomycetes) thrive as low-abundance members of the herbivore digestive tract. The genomes of anaerobic gut fungi are poorly characterized and have not been extensively mined for the biosynthetic enzymes of natural products such as antibiotics. Here, we investigate the potential of anaerobic gut fungi to synthesize natural products that could regulate membership within the gut microbiome. Complementary 'omics' approaches were combined to catalog the natural products of anaerobic gut fungi from four different representative species: <i>Anaeromyces robustus</i> (<i>A</i><i>robustus</i>), <i>Caecomyces churrovis</i> (<i>C</i><i>churrovis</i>), <i>Neocallimastix californiae</i> (<i>N</i><i>californiae</i>), and <i>Piromyces finnis</i> (<i>P</i><i>finnis</i>). In total, 146 genes were identified that encode biosynthetic enzymes for diverse types of natural products, including nonribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases. In addition, <i>N. californiae</i> and <i>C. churrovis</i> genomes encoded seven putative bacteriocins, a class of antimicrobial peptides typically produced by bacteria. During standard laboratory growth on plant biomass or soluble substrates, 26% of total core biosynthetic genes in all four strains were transcribed. Across all four fungal strains, 30% of total biosynthetic gene products were detected via proteomics when grown on cellobiose. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) characterization of fungal supernatants detected 72 likely natural products from <i>A. robustus</i> alone. A compound produced by all four strains of anaerobic fungi was putatively identified as the polyketide-related styrylpyrone baumin. Molecular networking quantified similarities between tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra among these fungi, enabling three groups of natural products to be identified that are unique to anaerobic fungi. Overall, these results support the finding that anaerobic gut fungi synthesize natural products, which could be harnessed as a source of antimicrobials, therapeutics, and other bioactive compounds.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are last defense line drugs against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Natural GPAs teicoplanin and vancomycin, as well as semisynthetic oritavancin, telavancin, and dalbavancin, are currently approved for clinical use. Although these antibiotics remain efficient, emergence of novel GPA-resistant pathogens is a question of time. Therefore, it is important to investigate the natural variety of GPAs coming from so-called \"rare\" actinobacteria. Herein we describe a novel GPA producer-<i>Nonomuraea coxensis</i> DSM 45129. Its <i>de novo</i> sequenced and completely assembled genome harbors a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) similar to the <i>dbv</i> BGC of A40926, the natural precursor to dalbavancin. The strain produces a novel GPA, which we propose is an A40926 analogue lacking the carboxyl group on the <i>N</i>-acylglucosamine moiety. This structural difference correlates with the absence of <i>dbv29</i>-coding for an enzyme responsible for the oxidation of the <i>N</i>-acylglucosamine moiety. Introduction of <i>dbv29</i> into <i>N. coxensis</i> led to A40926 production in this strain. Finally, we successfully applied <i>dbv3</i> and <i>dbv4</i> heterologous transcriptional regulators to trigger and improve A50926 production in <i>N. coxensis</i>, making them prospective tools for screening other <i>Nonomuraea</i> spp. for GPA production. Our work highlights genus <i>Nonomuraea</i> as a still untapped source of novel GPAs.",

They offer major opportunities for finding novel lead structures that are active against a broad spectrum of assay targets, particularly those from secondary metabolites of microbial origin. Due to traditional discovery approaches' limitations relying on untargeted screening methods, there is a growing trend to employ unconventional secondary metabolomics techniques. Aided by the more in-depth understanding of different biosynthetic pathways and the technological advancement in analytical instrumentation, the development of new methodologies provides an alternative that can accelerate discoveries of new lead-structures of natural origin. This present mini-review briefly discusses selected examples regarding advancements in bioinformatics and genomics (focusing on genome mining and metagenomics approaches), as well as bioanalytics (mass-spectrometry) towards the microbial NPs-based drug discovery and development.

Here, we sought to establish the baseline \"phenome\" of <i>R. lauricola</i> with knowledge concerning its metabolic capability, expanding our understanding of how these processes are impacted by environmental and host nutrients. Phenotypic screening using a microarray of over one thousand compounds was used to generate a detailed profile of <i>R. lauricola</i> substrate utilization and chemical sensitivity. These data revealed (i) relatively restricted carbon utilization, (ii) broad sulfur and phosphate utilization, and (iii) pH and osmotic sensitivities that could be rescued by specific compounds. Additional growth profiling on fatty acids revealed toxicity on C10 substrates and lower, with robust growth on C12-C18 fatty acids. Conditions for lipid droplet (LD) visualization and LD dynamics were examined using a series of lipid dyes. These data provide unique insights regarding <i>R. lauricola</i> metabolism and physiology, and identify distinct patterns of substrate usage and sensitivity which likely reflect important aspects of the host-microbe interface and can be exploited for the development of strategies for mitigating the spread of laurel wilt.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The pentapeptide repeat protein (PRP) superfamily, identified in 1998, has grown to nearly 39,000 sequences from over 3300 species. PRPs, recognized as having at least eight contiguous pentapeptide repeats (PRs) of a consensus pentapeptide sequence, adopt a remarkable structure, namely, a right-handed quadrilateral Î²-helix with four consecutive PRs forming a single Î²-helix coil. Adjacent coils join together to form a Î²-helix \"tower\" stabilized by Î²-ladders on the tower faces and type I, type II, or type IV Î²-turns facilitating an approximately -90Â° redirection of the polypeptide chain joining one coil face to the next. PRPs have been found in all branches of life, but they are predominantly found in cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria have existed on earth for more than two billion years and are thought to be responsible for oxygenation of the earth's atmosphere. Filamentous cyanobacteria such as <i>Nostoc</i> sp. strain PCC 7120 may also represent the oldest and simplest multicellular organisms known to undergo cell differentiation on earth. Knowledge of the biochemical function of these PRPs is essential to understanding how ancient cyanobacteria achieved functions critical to early development of life on earth. PRPs are predicted to exist in all cyanobacteria compartments including thylakoid and cell-wall membranes, cytoplasm, and thylakoid periplasmic space. Despite their intriguing structure and importance to understanding ancient cyanobacteria, the biochemical functions of PRPs in cyanobacteria remain almost completely unknown. The precise biochemical function of only a handful of PRPs is currently known from any organisms, and three-dimensional structures of only sixteen PRPs or PRP-containing multidomain proteins from any organism have been reported. In this review, the current knowledge of the structures and functions of PRPs is presented and discussed.",

However, the absence of in vivo trials undermines these results. This study aims to investigate the effect of isomaltulose on composition and functionality of gut microbiota in rats. Twelve Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups: the IsoMTL group was given free access to water containing 10% isomaltulose (<i>w/w</i>), and the control group was treated with normal water for five weeks. Moreover, 16S rRNA sequencing showed that ingestion of isomaltulose increased the abundances of beneficial microbiota, such as <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i>, and decreased levels of pathogens, including <i>Shuttleworthia</i>. Bacterial functional prediction showed that isomaltulose affected gut microbial functionalities, including secondary bile acid biosynthesis. Targeted metabolomics demonstrated that isomaltulose supplementation enhanced cholic acid concentration, and reduced levels of lithocholic acid, deoxycholic acid, dehydrocholic acid, and hyodeoxycholic acid. Moreover, the concentrations of propionate and butyrate were elevated in the rats administered with isomaltulose. This work suggests that isomaltulose modulates gut microbiota and the production of SCFAs and secondary bile acids in rats, which provides a scientific basis on the use of isomaltulose as a prebiotic.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Accessory chromosomes are strain- or pathotype-specific chromosomes that exist in addition to the core chromosomes of a species and are generally not considered essential to the survival of the organism. Among pathogenic fungal species, accessory chromosomes harbor pathogenicity or virulence factor genes, several of which are known to encode for secondary metabolites that are involved in plant tissue invasion. Accessory chromosomes are of particular interest due to their capacity for horizontal transfer between strains and their dynamic \"crosstalk\" with core chromosomes. This review focuses exclusively on secondary metabolism (including mycotoxin biosynthesis) associated with accessory chromosomes in filamentous fungi and the role accessory chromosomes play in the evolution of secondary metabolite gene clusters. Untargeted metabolomics profiling in conjunction with genome sequencing provides an effective means of linking secondary metabolite products with their respective biosynthetic gene clusters that reside on accessory chromosomes. While the majority of literature describing accessory chromosome-associated toxin biosynthesis comes from studies of <i>Alternaria</i> pathotypes, the recent discovery of accessory chromosome-associated biosynthetic genes in <i>Fusarium</i> species offer fresh insights into the evolution of biosynthetic enzymes such as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), polyketide synthases (PKSs) and regulatory mechanisms governing their expression.",

While many pathogens seek the lipids stored in LDs to fuel an expensive lifestyle, innate immunity rewires lipid metabolism and weaponizes LDs to defend cells and animals. Viruses, bacteria, and parasites directly and remotely manipulate LDs to obtain substrates for metabolic energy, replication compartments, assembly platforms, membrane blocks, and tools for host colonization and/or evasion such as anti-inflammatory mediators, lipoviroparticles, and even exosomes. Host LDs counterattack such advances by synthesizing bioactive lipids and toxic nucleotides, organizing immune signaling platforms, and recruiting a plethora of antimicrobial proteins to provide a front-line defense against the invader. Here, we review the current state of this conflict. We will discuss why, when, and how LDs efficiently coordinate and precisely execute a plethora of immune defenses.

Originally, we developed the EcoFlex system, a Golden Gate toolkit, to study genes/pathways flexibly usingÂ Escherichia coliÂ heterologous expression. In this current work, we sought to use EcoFlex to optimise a synthetic raspberry ketone biosynthetic pathway.Â Raspberry ketone is a high-value (~âÂ£20,000Â kg<sup>-1</sup>) fine chemical farmed from raspberry (Rubeus rubrum) fruit.<h4>Results</h4>Â By applying a synthetic biology led design-build-test-learn cycle approach, we refactor the raspberry ketone pathway from a low level of productivity (0.2Â mg/L), to achieve a 65-fold (12.9Â mg/L) improvement in production.Â We perform this optimisation at the prototype level (using microtiter plate cultures) with E. coli DH10Î², as a routine cloning host. The use of E. coli DH10Î² facilitates the Golden Gate cloning process for the screening of combinatorial libraries. In addition, we also newly establish a novel colour-based phenotypic screen to identify productive clones quickly from solid/liquid culture.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Â Our findings provide a stable raspberry ketone pathway that relies upon a natural feedstock (L-tyrosine) and uses only constitutive promoters to control gene expression. In conclusion we demonstrate the capability of EcoFlex for fine-tuning a model fine chemical pathway and provide a range of newly characterised promoter tools gene expression inÂ E. coli.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Overexpression of efflux pumps is one of the major determinants of resistance in bacteria. <i>Streptomyces</i> species harbor a large array of efflux pumps that are transcriptionally silenced under laboratory conditions. However, their dissemination results in multidrug resistance in different clinical pathogens. In this study, we have identified an efflux pump from <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i>, SCO4121, belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) family of transporters and characterized its role in antibiotic resistance. SCO4121 provided resistance to multiple dissimilar drugs upon overexpression in both native and heterologous hosts. Further, deletion of SCO4121 resulted in increased sensitivity toward ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol, suggesting the pump to be a major transporter of these substrates. Apart from providing multidrug resistance, SCO4121 imparted increased tolerance against the strong oxidant HOCl. In wild-type <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> cells, these drugs were found to transcriptionally regulate the pump in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, we identified SCO4122, a MarR regulator that positively regulates SCO4121 in response to various drugs and the oxidant HOCl. Thus, through these studies we present the multiple roles of SCO4121 in <i>S. coelicolor</i> and highlight the intricate mechanisms via which it is regulated in response to antibiotics and oxidative stress.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> One of the key mechanisms of drug resistance in bacteria is overexpression of efflux pumps. <i>Streptomyces</i> species are a reservoir of a large number of efflux pumps, potentially to provide resistance to both endogenous and nonendogenous antibiotics. While many of these pumps are not expressed under standard laboratory conditions, they result in resistance to multiple drugs when spread to other bacterial pathogens through horizontal gene transfer. In this study, we have identified a widely conserved efflux pump SCO4121 from <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> with roles in both multidrug resistance and oxidative stress tolerance. We also report the presence of an adjacent MarR regulator, SCO4122, which positively regulates SCO4121 in the presence of diverse substrates in a redox-responsive manner. This study highlights that soil bacteria such as <i>Streptomyces</i> can reveal novel mechanisms of antibiotic resistance that may potentially emerge in clinically important bacteria.",

These natural secondary metabolites are being explored in biotechnology to mediate electron transfer to the anode of bioelectrochemical systems. A major challenge is that only a small fraction of electrons from microbial substrate conversion is recovered. It remained unclear whether phenazines can re-enter the cell and thus, if the electrons accessed by the phenazines arise mainly from cytoplasmic or periplasmic pathways. Here, we prove that the periplasmic glucose dehydrogenase (Gcd) of P. aeruginosa and P. putida is involved in the reduction of natural phenazines. PYO displayed a 60-fold faster enzymatic reduction than PCA; PCA was, however, more stable for long-term electron shuttling to the anode. Evaluation of a Gcd knockout and overexpression strain showed that up to 9% of the anodic current can be designated to this enzymatic reaction. We further assessed phenazine uptake with the aid of two molecular biosensors, which experimentally confirm the phenazines' ability to re-enter the cytoplasm. These findings significantly advance the understanding of the (electro) physiology of phenazines for future tailoring of phenazine electron discharge in biotechnological applications.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antibiotic development based on natural products has faced a long lasting decline since the 1970s, while both the speed and the extent of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) development have been severely underestimated. The discovery of antimicrobial natural products of bacterial and fungal origin featuring new chemistry and previously unknown mode of actions is increasingly challenged by rediscovery issues. Natural products that are abundantly produced by the corresponding wild type organisms often featuring strong UV signals have been extensively characterized, especially the ones produced by extensively screened microbial genera such as streptomycetes. Purely synthetic chemistry approaches aiming to replace the declining supply from natural products as starting materials to develop novel antibiotics largely failed to provide significant numbers of antibiotic drug leads. To cope with this fundamental issue, microbial natural products science is being transformed from a 'grind-and-find' study to an integrated approach based on bacterial genomics and metabolomics. Novel technologies in instrumental analytics are increasingly employed to lower detection limits and expand the space of detectable substance classes, while broadening the scope of accessible and potentially bioactive natural products. Furthermore, the almost exponential increase in publicly available bacterial genome data has shown that the biosynthetic potential of the investigated strains by far exceeds the amount of detected metabolites. This can be judged by the discrepancy between the number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) encoded in the genome of each microbial strain and the number of secondary metabolites actually detected, even when considering the increased sensitivity provided by novel analytical instrumentation. <i>In silico</i> annotation tools for biosynthetic gene cluster classification and analysis allow fast prioritization in BGC-to-compound workflows, which is highly important to be able to process the enormous underlying data volumes. BGC prioritization is currently accompanied by novel molecular biology-based approaches to access the so-called orphan BGCs not yet correlated with a secondary metabolite. Integration of metabolomics, <i>in silico</i> genomics and molecular biology approaches into the mainstream of natural product research will critically influence future success and impact the natural product field in pharmaceutical, nutritional and agrochemical applications and especially in anti-infective research.",

To enable greater understanding and exploitation of actinobacterial genomes, specialized genomic databases must be linked to high-quality genome sequences. Here, we provide a curated database of 612 high-quality actinobacterial genomes from 80 genera, chosen to represent a broad phylogenetic group with equivalent genome re-annotation. Utilizing this database will provide researchers with a framework for evolutionary and metabolic studies, to enable a foundation for genome and metabolic engineering, to facilitate discovery of novel bioactive therapeutics and studies on gene family evolution.

        "pmc_abstract": "Overcoming resistance to bioactive small molecules is a significant challenge for health care and agriculture. As a result, efforts to uncover the mechanisms of resistance are essential to the development of new antibiotics, anticancer drugs and pesticides. To study how nature evolves resistance to highly potent natural products, we examined the biosynthesis and mechanism of self-resistance of the fungal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) inhibitor heptelidic acid (HA). HA is a nanomolar inhibitor of GADPH through the covalent modification of the active site cysteine thiol. The biosynthetic pathway of HA was elucidated, which uncovered the enzymatic basis of formation of the epoxide warhead. Structure-activity relationship study using biosynthetic intermediates established the importance of the fused lactone ring system in HA. The molecular basis of HA inhibiting human GAPDH was illustrated through the crystal structure of <i>Hs</i>-GAPDH covalently bound with HA. A GAPDH isozyme HepG encoded in the HA cluster was characterized to be less sensitive to HA, and therefore contribute to self-resistance for the producing host. Comparison of the crystal structures of human GAPDH and HepG showed mutations both within and remote to the active site can contribute to resistance of inactivation, which was confirmed through mutagenesis. Due to the critical role GAPDH plays in aerobic glycolysis and other cellular functions, knowledge of HA mode of action and self-resistance mechanism could accelerate the development of improved inhibitors.",

However, engineering the pathway to the thiomarinol antibiotics has proved challenging. Here we report that genes from a marine <i>Pseudoalternomonas</i> sp. producing thiomarinol can be expressed in functional form in the biosynthesis of the clinically important antibiotic mupirocin from the soil bacterium <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>. It is revealed that both pathways employ the same unusual mechanism of tetrahydropyran (THP) ring formation and the enzymes are cross compatible. Furthermore, the efficiency of downstream processing of 10,11-epoxy <i>versus</i> 10,11-alkenic metabolites are comparable. Optimisation of the fermentation conditions in an engineered strain in which production of pseudomonic acid A (with the 10,11-epoxide) is replaced by substantial titres of the more stable pseudomonic acid C (with a 10,11-alkene) pave the way for its development as a more stable antibiotic with wider applications than mupirocin.",

The resulting strain showed increased resistance to both natural statins (mevastatin and lovastatin) and semi-synthetic statin (simvastatin) when compared to the wild type strain.

The genus harbors prolific producers of wood-decaying enzymes, biocontrol agents against plant pathogens, plant-growth-promoting biofertilizers, as well as model organisms for studying fungal-plant-plant pathogen interactions. Pursuing highly accurate, contiguous, and chromosome-level reference genomes has become a primary goal of fungal research communities. Here, we report the chromosome-level genomic sequences and whole-genome annotation data sets of four strains used as biocontrol agents or biofertilizers (<i>Trichoderma virens</i> Gv29-8, <i>Trichoderma virens</i> FT-333, <i>Trichoderma asperellum</i> FT-101, and <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> P1). Our results provide comprehensive categorization, correct positioning, and evolutionary detail of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, including telomeres, AT-rich blocks, centromeres, transposons, mating-type loci, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial sequences, as well as many new secondary metabolic and carbohydrate-active enzyme gene clusters. We have also identified evolutionarily conserved core genes contributing to plant-fungal interactions, as well as variations potentially linked to key behavioral traits such as sex, genome defense, secondary metabolism, and mycoparasitism. The genomic resources we provide herein significantly extend our knowledge not only of this economically important fungal genus, but also fungal evolution and basic biology in general. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Telomere-to-telomere and gapless reference genome assemblies are necessary to ensure that all genomic variants are studied and discovered, including centromeres, telomeres, AT-rich blocks, mating type loci, biosynthetic, and metabolic gene clusters. Here, we applied long-range sequencing technologies to determine the near-completed genome sequences of four widely used biocontrol agents or biofertilizers: <i>Trichoderma virens</i> Gv29-8 and FT-333, <i>Trichoderma asperellum</i> FT-101, and <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> P1. Like those of three Trichoderma reesei wild isolates [QM6a, CBS999.97(<i>MAT1-1</i>) and CBS999.97(<i>MAT1-2</i>)] we reported previously, these four biocontrol agent genomes each contain seven nuclear chromosomes and a circular mitochondrial genome. Substantial intraspecies and intragenus diversities are also discovered, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, chromosome shuffling, as well as genomic relics derived from historical transposition events and repeat-induced point (RIP) mutations.",

Unfortunately, this also includes glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs), such as vancomycin and teicoplanin, which are currently being considered last-resort drugs. Emerging resistance towards GPAs risks limiting the clinical use of this class of antibiotics-our ultimate line of defense against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive pathogens. But where does this resistance come from? It is widely recognized that the GPA resistance determinants-<i>van</i> genes-might have originated from GPA producers, such as soil-dwelling Gram-positive actinobacteria, that use them for self-protection. In the current work, we present a comprehensive bioinformatics study on the distribution and phylogeny of GPA resistance determinants within the <i>Actinobacteria</i> phylum. Interestingly, <i>van</i>-like genes (<i>vlgs</i>) were found distributed in different arrangements not only among GPA-producing actinobacteria but also in the non-producers: more than 10% of the screened actinobacterial genomes contained one or multiple <i>vlgs</i>, while less than 1% encoded for a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). By phylogenetic reconstructions, our results highlight the co-evolution of the different <i>vlgs</i>, indicating that the most diffused are the ones coding for putative VanY carboxypeptidases, which can be found alone in the genomes or associated with a <i>vanS</i>/<i>R</i> regulatory pair.",

However, the evolution of new bacterial strains, along with excessive use and reckless consumption of antibiotics have led to the unfolding of antibiotic resistances to an excessive level. Multidrug resistance is a potential threat worldwide, and is escalating at an extremely high rate. Information related to drug resistance, and its regulation and control are still very little. To interpret the onset of antibiotic resistances, investigation on molecular analysis of resistance genes, their distribution and mechanisms are urgently required. Fine-tuned research and resistance profile regarding ESKAPE pathogen is also necessary along with other multidrug resistant bacteria. In the present scenario, the interaction of bacterial infections with SARS-CoV-2 is also crucial. Tracking and in-silico analysis of various resistance mechanisms or gene/s are crucial for overcoming the problem, and thus, the maintenance of relevant databases and wise use of antibiotics should be promoted. Creating awareness of this critical situation among individuals at every level is important to strengthen the fight against this fast-growing calamity. The review aimed to provide detailed information on antibiotic resistance, its regulatory molecular mechanisms responsible for the resistance, and other relevant information. In this article, we tried to focus on the correlation between antimicrobial resistance and the COVID-19 pandemic. This study will help in developing new interventions, potential approaches, and strategies to handle the complexity of antibiotic resistance and prevent the incidences of life-threatening infections.",

We determine the crystal structure of NapWÂ·NADPH complex and propose a catalytic mechanism by molecular dynamics simulation analysis. Additionally, a similar detoxification strategy is identified in the biosynthesis of saframycin A, another member of tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) antibiotics. Remarkably, similar SDRs are widely spread in bacteria and able to inactive other THIQ members including the clinical anticancer drug, ET-743.

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Aim</h4>The study is to verify the protective effects of miR-21-mediated fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) against myocardial ischemia in rats with coronary heart disease.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury were constructed, and the expression of miR-21 and FGF1 in them was interfered through ischemic postconditioning. The protective effects of miR-21-mediated FGF1 on myocardium of the model rats were analyzed, and the targeted regulatory relationship between miR-21 and FGF1 was verified through myocardial cell experiments to find the mechanism of miR-21.<h4>Results</h4>MiR-21 and FGF1 with increased expression could protect the cardiac function of model rats and improve their diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), coronary flow (CF), bax, and bcl-2 levels, but it would also cause further increase of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and decreased infarct size (INF). In addition, intervention through both miR-21 mimics and recombinant human FGF1 could highlight the above changes. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the expression of miR-21 was positively correlated with that of FGF1, and both miR-21 and FGF1 were significantly and linearly correlated with DBP, SBP, HR, CF, INF, bax, and bcl-2, but they were not significantly correlated with the VEGF level. The myocardial cell experiment results revealed that upregulation of miR-21 or FGF1 could alleviate apoptosis caused by hypoxia/reoxygenation of myocardial cells, and inhibition of the FGF1 expression could hinder the effect of miR-21 against apoptosis of myocardial cells. Dual luciferase reporter assay revealed that transfection of miR-21-mimics could effectively raise the fluorescence intensity of pmirGLO-FGF1-3'UTR Wt but had no significant effect on that of pmirGLO-FGF1-3'UTR Mut.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MiR-21 can specifically mediate the expression of FGF1 to relieve MI/R injury, protect the cardiac function, and resist apoptosis.",

In addition, these hydrogels were used as templates for the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (13.4 Â± 3.6 nm in diameter, TMGA-Ag) by using leaf extract of <i>Teminalia bellirica</i> as a reducing agent. Swelling kinetics and the equilibrium swelling behavior of the TMGA hydrogels were investigated in various pH environments, and the maximum % of equilibrium swelling behavior observed was 2882 Â± 1.2. The synthesized hydrogels and silver nanocomposites were characterized via UV, FTIR, XRD, SEM and TEM. TMGA and TMGA-Ag hydrogels were investigated to study the characteristics of drug delivery and antimicrobial study. Doxorubicin hydrochloride, a chemotherapeutic agent successfully encapsulated with maximum encapsulation efficiency, i.e., 69.20 Â± 1.2, was used in in vitro release studies in pH physiological and gastric environments at 37 Â°C. The drug release behavior was examined with kinetic models such as zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, Hixson Crowell and Korsmeyer-Peppas. These release data were best fitted with the Korsemeyer-Peppas transport mechanism, with <i>n</i> = 0.91. The effects of treatment on HCT116 human colon cancer cells were assessed via cell viability and cell cycle analysis. The antimicrobial activity of TMGA-Ag hydrogels was studied against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i>. Finally, the results demonstrate that TMGA and TMGA-Ag are promising candidates for anti-cancer drug delivery and the inactivation of pathogenic bacteria, respectively.",

The yatakemycin biosynthesis cluster in Streptomyces sp. TP-A0356 contains an AlkD-related DNA glycosylase, YtkR2, that serves as a self-resistance mechanism against yatakemycin toxicity. We previously reported that AlkD, which is not present in an SCPCHD producer, provides only limited resistance against yatakemycin. We now show that YtkR2 and C10R5, a previously uncharacterized homolog found in the CC-1065 biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces zelensis, confer far greater resistance against their respective SCPCHD natural products. We identify a structural basis for substrate specificity across gene clusters and show a correlation between in vivo resistance and in vitro enzymatic activity indicating that reduced product affinity-not enhanced substrate recognition-is the evolutionary outcome of selective pressure to provide self-resistance against yatakemycin and CC-1065.",

YobA and YebZ are homologs of the CopC periplasmic copper-binding protein and the CopD putative copper importer, respectively, whereas YebY belongs to the uncharacterized Domain of Unknown Function 2511 family. Despite numerous studies of E.Â coli copper homeostasis and the existence of the AZY operon in a range of bacteria, the operon's proteins and their functional roles have not been explored. In this study, we present the first biochemical and functional studies of the AZY proteins. Biochemical characterization and structural modeling indicate that YobA binds a single Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion with high affinity. Bioinformatics analysis shows that YebY is widespread and encoded either in AZY operons or in other genetic contexts unrelated to copper homeostasis. We also determined the 1.8Â Ã resolution crystal structure of E.Â coli YebY, which closely resembles that of the lantibiotic self-resistance protein MlbQ. Two strictly conserved cysteine residues form a disulfide bond, consistent with the observed periplasmic localization of YebY. Upon treatment with reductants, YebY binds Cu<sup>+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> with low affinity, as demonstrated by metal-binding analysis and tryptophan fluorescence. Finally, genetic manipulations show that the AZY operon is not involved in copper tolerance or antioxidant defense. Instead, YebY and YobA are required for the activity of the copper-related NADH dehydrogenase II. These results are consistent with a potential role of the AZY operon in copper delivery to membrane proteins.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Glycosylation inactivation is one of the important macrolide resistance mechanisms. The accumulated evidences attributed glycosylation inactivation to a glucosylation modification at the inactivation sites of macrolides. Whether other glycosylation modifications lead to macrolides inactivation is unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that varied glycosylation modifications could cause inactivation of midecamycin, a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic used clinically and agriculturally. Specifically, an actinomycetic glycosyltransferase (GT) OleD was selected for its glycodiversification capacity towards midecamycin. OleD was demonstrated to recognize UDP-D-glucose, UDP-D-xylose, UDP-galactose, UDP-rhamnose and UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine to yield corresponding midecamycin 2'-<i>O</i>-glycosides, most of which displayed low yields. Protein engineering of OleD was thus performed to improve its conversions towards sugar donors. Q327F was the most favorable variant with seven times the conversion enhancement towards UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine. Likewise, Q327A exhibited 30% conversion enhancement towards UDP-D-xylose. Potent biocatalysts for midecamycin glycosylation were thus obtained through protein engineering. Wild OleD, Q327F and Q327A were used as biocatalysts for scale-up preparation of midecamycin 2'-<i>O</i>-glucopyranoside, midecamycin 2'-<i>O</i>-GlcNAc and midecamycin 2'-<i>O</i>-xylopyranoside. In contrast to midecamycin, these midecamycin 2'-<i>O</i>-glycosides displayed no antimicrobial activities. These evidences suggested that besides glucosylation, other glycosylation patterns also could inactivate midecamycin, providing a new inactivation mechanism for midecamycin resistance. Cumulatively, glycosylation inactivation of midecamycin was independent of the type of attached sugar moieties at its inactivation site.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Covering: up to 2021Metagenomics has yielded massive amounts of sequencing data offering a glimpse into the biosynthetic potential of the uncultivated microbial majority. While genome-resolved information about microbial communities from nearly every environment on earth is now available, the ability to accurately predict biocatalytic functions directly from sequencing data remains challenging. Compared to primary metabolic pathways, enzymes involved in secondary metabolism often catalyze specialized reactions with diverse substrates, making these pathways rich resources for the discovery of new enzymology. To date, functional insights gained from studies on environmental DNA (eDNA) have largely relied on PCR- or activity-based screening of eDNA fragments cloned in fosmid or cosmid libraries. As an alternative, shotgun metagenomics holds underexplored potential for the discovery of new enzymes directly from eDNA by avoiding common biases introduced through PCR- or activity-guided functional metagenomics workflows. However, inferring new enzyme functions directly from eDNA is similar to searching for a 'needle in a haystack' without direct links between genotype and phenotype. The goal of this review is to provide a roadmap to navigate shotgun metagenomic sequencing data and identify new candidate biosynthetic enzymes. We cover both computational and experimental strategies to mine metagenomes and explore protein sequence space with a spotlight on natural product biosynthesis. Specifically, we compare <i>in silico</i> methods for enzyme discovery including phylogenetics, sequence similarity networks, genomic context, 3D structure-based approaches, and machine learning techniques. We also discuss various experimental strategies to test computational predictions including heterologous expression and screening. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the field with an emphasis on meta-omics, single-cell genomics, cell-free expression systems, and sequence-independent methods.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The aerodigestive tract (ADT) is the primary portal through which pathogens and other invading microbes enter the body. As the direct interface with the environment, we hypothesize that the ADT microbiota possess biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for antibiotics and other specialized metabolites to compete with both endogenous and exogenous microbes. From 1,214 bacterial genomes, representing 136 genera and 387 species that colonize the ADT, we identified 3,895 BGCs. To determine the distribution of BGCs and bacteria in different ADT sites, we aligned 1,424 metagenomes, from nine different ADT sites, onto the predicted BGCs. We show that alpha diversity varies across the ADT and that each site is associated with distinct bacterial communities and BGCs. We identify specific BGC families enriched in the buccal mucosa, external naris, gingiva, and tongue dorsum despite these sites harboring closely related bacteria. We reveal BGC enrichment patterns indicative of the ecology at each site. For instance, aryl polyene and resorcinol BGCs are enriched in the gingiva and tongue, which are colonized by many anaerobes. In addition, we find that streptococci colonizing the tongue and cheek possess different ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide BGCs. Finally, we highlight bacterial genera with BGCs but are underexplored for specialized metabolism and demonstrate the bioactivity of <i>Actinomyces</i> against other bacteria, including human pathogens. Together, our results demonstrate that specialized metabolism in the ADT is extensive and that by exploring these microbiomes further, we will better understand the ecology and biogeography of this system and identify new bioactive natural products. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacteria produce specialized metabolites to compete with other microbes. Though the biological activities of many specialized metabolites have been determined, our understanding of their ecology is limited, particularly within the human microbiome. As the aerodigestive tract (ADT) faces the external environment, bacteria colonizing this tract must compete both among themselves and with invading microbes, including human pathogens. We analyzed the genomes of ADT bacteria to identify biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for specialized metabolites. We found that the majority of ADT BGCs are uncharacterized and the metabolites they encode are unknown. We mapped the distribution of BGCs across the ADT and determined that each site is associated with its own distinct bacterial community and BGCs. By further characterizing these BGCs, we will inform our understanding of ecology and biogeography across the ADT, and we may uncover new specialized metabolites, including antibiotics.",

It is widely used as an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients who, incidentally, are at risk for <i>Pneumocystis</i> pneumonia (PCP). We hypothesized that MPA exerts selective pressure on <i>P. jirovecii</i> microorganisms considering its in vitro antifungal activity on other fungi. Thus, we analysed <i>impdh</i> gene in <i>P. jirovecii</i> isolates from SOT recipients. <i>P. jirovecii</i> specimens from 26 patients diagnosed with PCP from 2010 to 2020 were retrospectively examined: 10 SOT recipients treated with MPA and 16 non-SOT patients without prior exposure to MPA. The <i>P. jirovecii impdh</i> gene was amplified and sequenced. Nucleotide sequences were aligned with the reference sequences retrieved from available <i>P. jirovecii</i> whole genomes. The deduced IMPDH protein sequences were aligned with available IMPDH proteins from <i>Pneumocystis</i> spp. and other fungal species known to be in vitro sensitive or resistant to MPA. A total of nine SNPs was identified. One SNP (G1020A) that results in an Ala261Thr substitution was identified in all SOT recipients and in none of the non-SOT patients. Considering that IMPDHs of other fungi, resistant to MPA, harbour Thr (or Ser) at the analogous position, the Ala261Thr mutation observed in MPA-treated patients was considered to represent the signature of <i>P. jirovecii</i> exposure to MPA. These results suggest that MPA may be involved in the selection of specific <i>P. jirovecii</i> strains that circulate in the SOT recipient population.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Enterococcus</i> spp. are one of the most frequent producers of bacteriocins (enterocins), which provides them with an advantage to compete in their natural environment, which is the gut of humans and many animals. The enterocins' activity against microorganisms from different phylogenetic groups has raised interest in <i>Enterococcus</i> spp. in different contexts throughout the last decades, especially in the food industry. Nevertheless, some species can also cause opportunistic life-threatening infections and are frequently multidrug-resistant (MDR). Vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus</i> (VRE), in particular, are an ongoing global challenge given the lack of therapeutic options. In this scenario, bacteriocins can offer a potential solution to this persistent threat, either alone or in combination with other antimicrobials. There are a handful of studies that demonstrate the advantages and applications of bacteriocins, especially against VRE. The purpose of this review is to present a current standpoint about the dual role of <i>Enterococcus</i> spp., from important producers to targets needed to be controlled, and the crucial role that enterocins may have in the expansion of enterococcal populations. Classification and distribution of enterocins, the current knowledge about the bacteriocinome of clinical enterococci, and the challenges of bacteriocin use in the fight against VRE infections are particularly detailed.",

The richness of genomic data currently available allows filtering for high quality genomes, which in turn permits reliable comparative genomics studies and an improved prediction of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) through genome mining approaches. In this work, we used 121 genome sequences of the genus <i>Streptomyces</i> in a comparative genomics study with the aim of estimating the genomic diversity by protein domains content, sequence similarity of proteins and conservation of Intergenic Regions (IGRs). We also searched for BGCs but prioritizing those with potential antibiotic activity. Our analysis revealed that the pan-genome of the genus <i>Streptomyces</i> is clearly open, with a high quantity of unique gene families across the different species and that the IGRs are rarely conserved. We also described the phylogenetic relationships of the analyzed genomes using multiple markers, obtaining a trustworthy tree whose relationships were further validated by Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) calculations. Finally, 33 biosynthetic gene clusters were detected to have potential antibiotic activity and a predicted mode of action, which might serve up as a guide to formulation of related experimental studies.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Secondary metabolites (SMs) are a vast group of compounds with different structures and properties that have been utilized as drugs, food additives, dyes, and as monomers for novel plastics. In many cases, the biosynthesis of SMs is catalysed by enzymes whose corresponding genes are co-localized in the genome in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Notably, BGCs may contain so-called gap genes, that are not involved in the biosynthesis of the SM. Current genome mining tools can identify BGCs, but they have problems with distinguishing essential genes from gap genes. This can and must be done by expensive, laborious, and time-consuming comparative genomic approaches or transcriptome analyses. In this study, we developed a method that allows semi-automated identification of essential genes in a BGC based on co-evolution analysis. To this end, the protein sequences of a BGC are blasted against a suitable proteome database. For each protein, a phylogenetic tree is created. The trees are compared by treeKO to detect co-evolution. The results of this comparison are visualized in different output formats, which are compared visually. Our results suggest that co-evolution is commonly occurring within BGCs, albeit not all, and that especially those genes that encode for enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway are co-evolutionary linked and can be identified with FunOrder. In light of the growing number of genomic data available, this will contribute to the studies of BGCs in native hosts and facilitate heterologous expression in other organisms with the aim of the discovery of novel SMs.",

The focus is put on the current challenges and future perspectives surrounding medicinal plants antimicrobial activity. There are some inherent challenges regarding medicinal plant extracts and their antimicrobial efficacy. Appropriate and optimized extraction methodology plant species dependent leads to upgraded and selective extracted compounds. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests for the determination of the antimicrobial activity of plant extracts may show variations in obtained results. Moreover, there are several difficulties and problems that need to be overcome for the development of new antimicrobials from plant extracts, while efforts have been made to enhance the antimicrobial activity of chemical compounds.

Strains that over-expressed the <i>scr3559</i> gene region exhibited a shortened exponential growth phase in comparison with a control strain; accelerated aerial mycelium formation and spore maturation; alongside an elevated production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin. These observations were supported by LC-MS analyses of other produced metabolites, including: germicidins, desferrioxamines, and coelimycin. A subsequent microarray differential analysis revealed increased expression of genes associated with the described morphological and physiological changes.

Several orthogonal genome mining strategies have been developed in recent years to target specific chemical features or biological properties of bioactive molecules using biosynthetic, resistance, or transporter proteins. These \"biosynthetic hooks\" allow researchers to query for biosynthetic gene clusters with a high probability of encoding previously undiscovered, bioactive compounds. This review highlights recent case studies that feature orthogonal approaches that exploit genomic information to specifically discover bioactive natural products and their gene clusters.",

Often serving to boost competitive advantage for their producers, these secondary metabolites have widespread human impacts as antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and antifungal drugs. The natural products discovery field has begun a shift away from traditional activity-guided approaches and is beginning to take advantage of increasingly available metabolomics and genomics datasets to explore undiscovered chemical space. Major strides have been made and now enable -omics-informed prioritization of chemical structures for discovery, including the prospect of confidently linking metabolites to their biosynthetic pathways. Over the last decade, more integrated strategies now provide researchers with pipelines for simultaneous identification of expressed secondary metabolites and their biosynthetic machinery. However, continuous collaboration by the natural products community will be required to optimize strategies for effective evaluation of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters to accelerate discovery efforts. Here, we provide an evaluative guide to scientific literature as it relates to studying natural product biosynthesis using genomics, metabolomics, and their integrated datasets. Particular emphasis is placed on the unique insights that can be gained from large-scale integrated strategies, and we provide source organism-specific considerations to evaluate the gaps in our current knowledge.",

Deletion of the sole cluster-situated StrR family regulatory gene, <i>asrR</i>, abolished ristomycin A production and the transcription of the <i>asr</i> genes <i>orf5</i> to <i>orf39</i>. The ristomycin A fermentation titer in <i>Amycolatopsis</i> sp. strain TNS106 was dramatically improved by overexpression of <i>asrR</i> and a heterologous StrR family regulatory gene, <i>bbr</i>, from the balhimycin-biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) utilizing strong promoters and multiple gene copies. Ristomycin A production was improved by approximately 60-fold, resulting in a fermentation titer of 4.01 g/liter in flask culture, in one of the engineered strains. Overexpression of AsrR and Bbr upregulated transcription of tested <i>asr</i> biosynthetic genes, indicating that these <i>asr</i> genes were positively regulated by AsrR and Bbr. However, only the promoter region of the <i>asrR</i> operon and the intergenic region upstream of <i>orf12</i> were bound by AsrR and Bbr in gel retardation assays, suggesting that AsrR and Bbr directly regulated the <i>asrR</i> operon and probably <i>orf12</i> to <i>orf14</i> but no other <i>asr</i> biosynthetic genes. Further assays with synthetic short probes showed that AsrR and Bbr specifically bound not only probes containing the canonical inverted repeats but also a probe with only one 7-bp element of the inverted repeats in its native context. AsrR and Bbr have an N-terminal ParB-like domain and a central winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. Site-directed mutations indicated that the N-terminal ParB-like domain was involved in activation of ristomycin A biosynthesis and did not affect the DNA-binding activity of AsrR and Bbr. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study showed that overexpression of either a native StrR family regulator (AsrR) or a heterologous StrR family regulator (Bbr) dramatically improved ristomycin A production by increasing the transcription of biosynthetic genes directly or indirectly. The conserved ParB-like domain of AsrR and Bbr was demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of <i>asr</i> BGC expression. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of StrR family regulators in the regulation of glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis. Furthermore, the regulator overexpression plasmids constructed in this study could serve as valuable tools for strain improvement and genome mining for new glycopeptide antibiotics. In addition, ristomycin A is a type III glycopeptide antibiotic clinically used as a diagnostic reagent due to its side effects. The overproduction strains engineered in this study are ideal materials for industrial production of ristomycin A.",

        "pmc_abstract": "In natural environments, antibiotics are important means of interspecies competition. At subinhibitory concentrations, they act as cues or signals inducing antibiotic production; however, our knowledge of well-documented antibiotic-based sensing systems is limited. Here, for the soil actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis, we describe a fundamentally new ribosome-mediated signaling cascade that accelerates the onset of lincomycin production in response to an external ribosome-targeting antibiotic to synchronize antibiotic production within the population. The entire cascade is encoded in the lincomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and consists of three lincomycin resistance proteins in addition to the transcriptional regulator LmbU: a lincomycin transporter (LmrA), a 23S rRNA methyltransferase (LmrB), both of which confer high resistance, and an ATP-binding cassette family F (ABCF) ATPase, LmrC, which confers only moderate resistance but is essential for antibiotic-induced signal transduction. Specifically, antibiotic sensing occurs via ribosome-mediated attenuation, which activates LmrC production in response to lincosamide, streptogramin A, or pleuromutilin antibiotics. Then, ATPase activity of the ribosome-associated LmrC triggers the transcription of <i>lmbU</i> and consequently the expression of lincomycin BGC. Finally, the production of LmrC is downregulated by LmrA and LmrB, which reduces the amount of ribosome-bound antibiotic and thus fine-tunes the cascade. We propose that analogous ABCF-mediated signaling systems are relatively common because many ribosome-targeting antibiotic BGCs encode an ABCF protein accompanied by additional resistance protein(s) and transcriptional regulators. Moreover, we revealed that three of the eight coproduced ABCF proteins of <i>S. lincolnensis</i> are clindamycin responsive, suggesting that the ABCF-mediated antibiotic signaling may be a widely utilized tool for chemical communication. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Resistance proteins are perceived as mechanisms protecting bacteria from the inhibitory effect of their produced antibiotics or antibiotics from competitors. Here, we report that antibiotic resistance proteins regulate lincomycin biosynthesis in response to subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. In particular, we show the dual character of the ABCF ATPase LmrC, which confers antibiotic resistance and simultaneously transduces a signal from ribosome-bound antibiotics to gene expression, where the 5' untranslated sequence upstream of its encoding gene functions as a primary antibiotic sensor. ABCF-mediated antibiotic signaling can in principle function not only in the induction of antibiotic biosynthesis but also in selective gene expression in response to any small molecules targeting the 50S ribosomal subunit, including clinically important antibiotics, to mediate intercellular antibiotic signaling and stress response induction. Moreover, the resistance-regulatory function of LmrC presented here for the first time unifies functionally inconsistent ABCF family members involving antibiotic resistance proteins and translational regulators.",

Taricha newts, which contain high concentrations of the deadly toxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) as an antipredator defense, have evolved resistance to self-intoxication, which is a complex adaptation requiring changes in six paralogs of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) gene family, the physiological target of TTX. Here, we reconstruct the origins of TTX self-resistance by sequencing the entire Nav gene family in newts and related salamanders. We show that moderate TTX resistance evolved early in the salamander lineage in three of the six Nav paralogs, preceding the proposed appearance of tetrodotoxic newts by â¼100 My. TTX-bearing newts possess additional unique substitutions across the entire Nav gene family that provide physiological TTX resistance. These substitutions coincide with signatures of positive selection and relaxed purifying selection, as well as gene conversion events, that together likely facilitated their evolution. We also identify a novel exon duplication within Nav1.4 encoding an expressed TTX-binding site. Two resistance-conferring changes within newts appear to have spread via nonallelic gene conversion: in one case, one codon was copied between paralogs, and in the second, multiple substitutions were homogenized between the duplicate exons of Nav1.4. Our results demonstrate that gene conversion can accelerate the coordinated evolution of gene families in response to a common selection pressure.",

They inhibit protein biosynthesis in bacterial pathogens by narrowing the nascent protein exit tunnel in the ribosome.

Most of the macrolides used currently are semi-synthetic erythromycin derivatives, composed of a 14- or 15-membered macrolactone ring. Rapidly emerging resistance in bacterial pathogens is among the most urgent global health challenges, which render many antibiotics ineffective, including next-generation macrolides. To address this threat and advance a longer-term plan for developing new antibiotics, we demonstrate how 16-membered macrolides overcome erythromycin resistance in clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains. By determining the structures of complexes of the large ribosomal subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans (D50S) with these 16-membered selected macrolides, and performing anti-microbial studies, we identified resistance mechanisms they may overcome.

Most cancer patients receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but these treatments are usually only partially efficacious and lead to a variety of serious side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new therapeutic strategies. The emergence of nanotechnology has had a profound impact on general clinical treatment. The application of nanotechnology has facilitated the development of nano-drug delivery systems (NDDSs) that are highly tumor selective and allow for the slow release of active anticancer drugs. In recent years, vehicles such as liposomes, dendrimers and polymer nanomaterials have been considered promising carriers for tumor-specific drug delivery, reducing toxicity and improving biocompatibility. Among them, polymer nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the most innovative methods of non-invasive drug delivery. Here, we review the application of polymer NPs in drug delivery, gene therapy, and early diagnostics for cancer therapy.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The development of new antibiotics is imperative to fight increasing mortality rates connected to infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. In this context, Gram-negative pathogens listed in the WHO priority list are particularly problematic. Darobactin is a ribosomally produced and post-translationally modified bicyclic heptapeptide antibiotic selectively killing Gram-negative bacteria by targeting the outer membrane protein BamA. The native darobactin A producer <i>Photorhabdus khanii</i> HGB1456 shows very limited production under laboratory cultivation conditions. Herein, we present the design and heterologous expression of a synthetically engineered darobactin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> to reach an average darobactin A production titre of 13.4 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. Rational design of <i>darA</i> variants, encoding the darobactin precursor peptide with altered core sequences, resulted in the production of 13 new 'non-natural' darobactin derivatives and 4 previously hypothetical natural darobactins. One of the non-natural compounds, darobactin 9, was more potent than darobactin A, and showed significantly improved activity especially against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (0.125 Î¼g mL<sup>-1</sup>) and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (1-2 Î¼g mL<sup>-1</sup>). Importantly, it also displayed superior activity against MDR clinical isolates of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> (1-2 Î¼g mL<sup>-1</sup>) and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (1-4 Î¼g mL<sup>-1</sup>). Independent deletions of genes from the darobactin BGC showed that only <i>darA</i> and <i>darE</i>, encoding a radical forming <i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent enzyme, are required for darobactin formation. Co-expression of two additional genes associated with the BGCs in hypothetical producer strains identified a proteolytic detoxification mechanism as a potential self-resistance strategy in native producers. Taken together, we describe a versatile heterologous darobactin platform allowing the production of unprecedented active derivatives in good yields, and we provide first experimental evidence for darobactin biosynthesis processes.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus is the most common rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria to cause pulmonary disease in patients with impaired lung function such as cystic fibrosis. M. abscessus displays high intrinsic resistance to common antibiotics and inducible resistance to macrolides like clarithromycin. As such, M. abscessus is clinically resistant to the entire regimen of front-line M. tuberculosis drugs, and treatment with antibiotics that do inhibit M. abscessus in the lab results in cure rates of 50% or less. Here, we identified epetraborole (EPT) from the MMV pandemic response box as an inhibitor against the essential protein leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) in M. abscessus. EPT protected zebrafish from lethal M. abscessus infection and did not induce self-resistance nor against clarithromycin. Contrary to most antimycobacterials, the whole-cell activity of EPT was greater against M. abscessus than M. tuberculosis, but crystallographic and equilibrium binding data showed that EPT binds LeuRSMabs and LeuRSMtb with similar residues and dissociation constants. Since EPT-resistant M. abscessus mutants lost LeuRS editing activity, these mutants became susceptible to misaminoacylation with leucine mimics like the non-proteinogenic amino acid norvaline. Proteomic analysis revealed that when M. abscessus LeuRS mutants were fed norvaline, leucine residues in proteins were replaced by norvaline, inducing the unfolded protein response with temporal changes in expression of GroEL chaperonins and Clp proteases. This supports our in vitro data that supplementation of media with norvaline reduced the emergence of EPT mutants in both M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, the combination of EPT and norvaline had improved in vivo efficacy compared to EPT in a murine model of M. abscessus infection. Our results emphasize the effectiveness of EPT against the clinically relevant cystic fibrosis pathogen M. abscessus, and these findings also suggest norvaline adjunct therapy with EPT could be beneficial for M. abscessus and other mycobacterial infections like tuberculosis.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Streptomyces scabies is a phytopathogen associated with common scab disease. This is mainly attributed to its ability to produce the phytotoxin thaxtomin A, the biosynthesis of which is triggered by cellobiose. During a survey of other metabolites released in the presence of cellobiose, we discovered additional compounds in the thaxtomin-containing extract from <i>Streptomyces scabies</i>. Structural analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed that these compounds are amino acid sequence variants of the TOR (target of rapamycin) kinase (TORK) pathway-inhibitory lipopeptide rotihibin A, and the main compounds were named rotihibins C and D. In contrast to thaxtomin, the production of rotihibins C and D was also elicited in the presence of glucose, indicating different regulation of their biosynthesis. Through a combination of shotgun and targeted proteomics, the putative rotihibin biosynthetic gene cluster <i>rth</i> was identified in the publicly available genome of S. scabies 87-22. This cluster spans 33 kbp and encodes 2 different nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and 12 additional enzymes. Homologous <i>rth</i> biosynthetic gene clusters were found in other publicly available and complete actinomycete genomes. Rotihibins C and D display herbicidal activity against Lemna minor and Arabidopsis thaliana at low concentrations, shown by monitoring the effects on growth and the maximal photochemistry efficiency of photosystem II. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Rotihibins A and B are plant growth inhibitors acting on the TORK pathway. We report the isolation and characterization of new sequence analogues of rotihibin from <i>Streptomyces scabies</i>, a major cause of common scab in potato and other tuber and root vegetables. By combining proteomics data with genomic analysis, we found a cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster coding for enzyme machinery capable of rotihibin production. This work may lead to the biotechnological production of variants of this lipopeptide to investigate the exact mechanism by which it can target the plant TORK pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, bioinformatics revealed the existence of other variants in plant-associated <i>Streptomyces</i> strains, both pathogenic and nonpathogenic species, raising new questions about the actual function of this lipopeptide. The discovery of a module in the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) that incorporates the unusual citrulline residue may improve the prediction of peptides encoded by cryptic NRPS gene clusters.",

The natural product thiomarinol A is a hybrid of two antibiotics: holothin, a dithiolopyrrolone (DTP), and marinolic acid, a close analogue of the drug mupirocin that is used to treat methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA). DTPs disrupt metal homeostasis by chelating metal ions in cells, whereas mupirocin targets the essential enzyme isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS). Thiomarinol A is over 100-fold more potent than mupirocin against mupirocin-sensitive MRSA; however, its mode of action has been unknown. We show that thiomarinol A targets IleRS. A knockdown of the IleRS-encoding gene, <i>ileS</i>, exhibited sensitivity to a synthetic analogue of thiomarinol A in a chemical genomics screen. Thiomarinol A inhibits MRSA IleRS with a picomolar <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> and binds to IleRS with low femtomolar affinity, 1600 times more tightly than mupirocin. We find that thiomarinol A remains effective against high-level mupirocin-resistant MRSA and provide evidence to support a dual mode of action for thiomarinol A that may include both IleRS inhibition and metal chelation. We demonstrate that MRSA develops resistance to thiomarinol A to a substantially lesser degree than mupirocin and the potent activity of thiomarinol A requires hybridity between DTP and mupirocin. Our findings identify a mode of action of a natural hybrid antibiotic and demonstrate the potential of hybrid antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance.",

However, whether 2'-phosphorylation is necessary for the last step of biosynthesis, the formation of the amide bond between AHA and nonproteinogenic amino acids, remains ambiguous. Here, we address this question with comprehensive <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> characterizations of PolG and NikS, which together provide strong evidence that amide ligation proceeds with 2'-phosphorylated substrates in both pathways.

        "pmc_abstract": "The pressing issue of the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and resistant bacteria in the environment (ARGs and ARB, respectively) requires procedures for assessing the risk to health. The chemo-centric environmental risk assessment models identify hazard(s) in a dose-response manner, obtaining exposure, toxicity, risk, impact and policy. However, this risk assessment approach based on ARGs/ARB evaluation from a quantitative viewpoint shows high unpredictability because ARGs/ARB cannot be considered as standard hazardous molecules: ARB duplicate and ARGs evolve within a biological host. ARGs/ARB are currently listed as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CEC). In light of such characteristics, we propose to define ARGs/ARB within a new category of evolving CEC (or e-CEC). ARGs/ARB, like any other evolving determinants (e.g., viruses, bacteria, genes), escape environmental controls. When they do so, just one molecule left remaining at a control point can form the origin of a new dangerous and selection-responsive population. As a consequence, perhaps it is time to acknowledge this trait and to include evolutionary concepts within modern risk assessment of e-CEC. In this perspective we analyze the evolutionary responses most likely to influence risk assessment, and we speculate on the means by which current methods could measure evolution. Further work is required to implement and exploit such experimental procedures in future risk assessment protocols.",

Here, we present the second ActinoBase review showcasing selected reports published in 2020 and early 2021, integrating perspectives in the actinomycete field. Actinomycetes are well-known for their unsurpassed ability to produce specialised metabolites, of which many are used as therapeutic agents with antibacterial, antifungal, or immunosuppressive activities. Much research is carried out to understand the purpose of these metabolites in the environment, either within communities or in host interactions. Moreover, many efforts have been placed in developing computational tools to handle big data, simplify experimental design, and find new biosynthetic gene cluster prioritisation strategies. Alongside, synthetic biology has provided advances in tools to elucidate the biosynthesis of these metabolites. Additionally, there are still mysteries to be uncovered in understanding the fundamentals of filamentous actinomycetes' developmental cycle and regulation of their metabolism. This review focuses on research using integrative methodologies and approaches to understand the bigger picture of actinomycete biology, covering four research areas: <i>i</i>) technology and methodology; <i>ii</i>) specialised metabolites; <i>iii</i>) development and regulation; and <i>iv</i>) ecology and host interactions.",

The biosynthetic pathway of HA was elucidated with heterologous reconstitution. Guided by a putative self-resistance enzyme in the genome, HA was biochemically demonstrated to be a selective inhibitor of fungal AHAS, including those from phytopathogenic fungi. In addition, HA can inhibit a common resistant variant of AHAS in which the active site proline is mutated. Structural analysis of AHAS complexed with HA revealed the molecular basis of competitive inhibition, which differs from all known commercial AHAS inhibitors. The alternative binding mode also rationalizes the selectivity of HA, as well as effectiveness toward resistant mutants. A proposed role of HA biosynthesis by Tht22 in the rhizosphere is discussed based on the data.",

Computational biology tools assisted the designing of a synthetic <i>alaD</i> gene cassette, which was further cloned in shuttle vector pLES003 and expressed using an auto-inducible P289 promoter.

The recombinant strain expressing the synthetic <i>alaD</i> gene produced 229.12 g/L of L-alanine after 42 h of fed-batch fermentation, which is the second highest microbial L-alanine titer reported so far. After extraction and crystallization, 95% crystal L-alanine (217.54 g/L) was recovered from the culture broth with an enantiomeric purity of 97%.

Antibiotics are used in human, livestock and agriculture, contributing to its escalation in the environment. Environmental antibiotics pose a range of risks and have significant effects on human and animal health. Nevertheless, this is the result of the development of antibiotic-resistant and multi-drug-resistant bacteria. In the area of health care, animal husbandry and crop processing, the imprudent use of antibiotic drugs produces antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This threat is the deepest in the developing world, with an estimated 700,000 people suffering from antibiotic-resistant infections each year. The study explores how bacteria use a wide variety of antibiotic resistance mechanism and how these approaches have an impact on the environment and on our health.

        "pmc_abstract": "Surfactin is described as a powerful biosurfactant and is natively produced by Bacillus subtilis in notable quantities. Among other industrially relevant characteristics, antimicrobial properties have been attributed to surfactin-producing Bacillus isolates. To investigate this property, stress approaches were carried out with biotechnologically established strains of Corynebacterium glutamicum, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida with the highest possible amounts of surfactin. Contrary to the popular opinion, the highest growth-reducing effects were detectable in B. subtilis and E. coli after surfactin treatment of 100 g/L with 35 and 33%, respectively, while P. putida showed no growth-specific response. In contrast, other antimicrobial biosurfactants, like rhamnolipids and sophorolipids, showed significantly stronger effects on bacterial growth. Since the addition of high amounts of surfactin in defined mineral salt medium reduced the cell growth of B. subtilis by about 40%, the initial stress response at the protein level was analyzed by mass spectrometry, showing induction of stress proteins under control of alternative sigma factors ÏB and ÏW as well as the activation of LiaRS two-component system. Overall, although surfactin is associated with antimicrobial properties, relatively low growth-reducing effects could be demonstrated after the surfactin addition, challenging the general claim of the antimicrobial properties of surfactin.",

Albomycins function as specific inhibitors of seryl-tRNA synthetases and exhibit potent antimicrobial activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including many clinical pathogens. These distinctive features make albomycins promising drug candidates for the treatment of various bacterial infections, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. We herein summarize findings on the discovery and structure elucidation, mechanism of action, biosynthesis and immunity, and chemical synthesis of albomcyins, with special focus on recent advances in the biosynthesis and chemical synthesis over the past decade (2012-2022). A thorough understanding of the biosynthetic pathway provides the basis for pathway engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis to create new albomycin analogues.

Dalbaheptides are produced by soil-dwelling high G-C Gram-positive actinobacteria. Their biosynthetic pathways are encoded within large biosynthetic gene clusters. A non-ribosomally synthesized heptapeptide aglycone is the common scaffold for all dalbaheptides. Different enzymatic tailoring steps, including glycosylation, are further involved in decorating it. Glycosylation of dalbaheptides is a crucial step, conferring them specific biological activities. It is achieved by a plethora of glycosyltransferases, encoded within the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters, able to install different sugar residues. These sugars might originate from the primary metabolism, or, alternatively, their biosynthesis might be encoded within the biosynthetic gene clusters. Already installed monosaccharides might be further enzymatically modified or work as substrates for additional glycosylation. In the current minireview, we cover recent updates concerning the genetics and enzymology behind the glycosylation of dalbaheptides, building a detailed and consecutive picture of this process and of its biological evolution. A thorough understanding of how glycosyltransferases function in dalbaheptide biosynthesis might open new ways to use them in chemo-enzymatic synthesis and/or in combinatorial biosynthesis for building novel glycosylated antibiotics.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Streptomyces</i> sp. BRA-346 is an Actinobacteria isolated from the Brazilian endemic tunicate <i>Euherdmania</i> sp. We have reported that this strain produces epoxyketone peptides, as dihydroeponemycin (DHE) and structurally related analogs. This cocktail of epoxyketone peptides inhibits the proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity and shows high cytotoxicity to glioma cells. However, low yields and poor reproducibility of epoxyketone peptides production by BRA-346 under laboratory cultivation have limited the isolation of epoxyketone peptides for additional studies. Here, we evaluated several cultivation methods using different culture media and chemical elicitors to increase the repertoire of peptide epoxyketone production by this bacterium. Furthermore, BRA-346 genome was sequenced, revealing its broad genetic potential, which is mostly hidden under laboratory conditions. By using specific growth conditions, we were able to evidence different classes of secondary metabolites produced by BRA-346. In addition, by combining genome mining with untargeted metabolomics, we could link the metabolites produced by BRA-346 to its genetic capacity and potential regulators. A single biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was related to the production of the target epoxyketone peptides by BRA-346. The candidate BGC displays conserved biosynthetic enzymes with the reported eponemycin (EPN) and TMC-86A (TMC) BGCs. The core of the putative epoxyketone peptide BGC (ORFs A-L), in which ORF A is a LuxR-like transcription factor, was cloned into a heterologous host. The recombinant organism was capable to produce TMC and EPN natural products, along with the biosynthetic intermediates DH-TMC and DHE, and additional congeners. A phylogenetic analysis of the <i>epn/tmc</i> BGC revealed related BGCs in public databases. Most of them carry a proteasome beta-subunit, however, lacking an assigned specialized metabolite. The retrieved BGCs also display a diversity of regulatory genes and TTA codons, indicating tight regulation of this BGC at the transcription and translational levels. These results demonstrate the plasticity of the <i>epn/tmc</i> BGC of BRA-346 in producing epoxyketone peptides and the feasibility of their production in a heterologous host. This work also highlights the capacity of BRA-346 to tightly regulate its secondary metabolism and shed light on how to awake silent gene clusters of <i>Streptomyces</i> sp.

        "pmc_abstract": "Sustainable agricultural production is critically antagonistic by fluctuating unfavorable environmental conditions. The introduction of mineral elements emerged as the most exciting and magical aspect, apart from the novel intervention of traditional and applied strategies to defend the abiotic stress conditions. The silicon (Si) has ameliorating impacts by regulating diverse functionalities on enhancing the growth and development of crop plants. Si is categorized as a non-essential element since crop plants accumulate less during normal environmental conditions. Studies on the application of Si in plants highlight the beneficial role of Si during extreme stressful conditions through modulation of several metabolites during abiotic stress conditions. Phytohormones are primary plant metabolites positively regulated by Si during abiotic stress conditions. Phytohormones play a pivotal role in crop plants' broad-spectrum biochemical and physiological aspects during normal and extreme environmental conditions. Frontline phytohormones include auxin, cytokinin, ethylene, gibberellin, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, and jasmonic acid. These phytohormones are internally correlated with Si in regulating abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms. This review explores insights into the role of Si in enhancing the phytohormone metabolism and its role in maintaining the physiological and biochemical well-being of crop plants during diverse abiotic stresses. Moreover, in-depth information about Si's pivotal role in inducing abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants through metabolic and molecular modulations is elaborated. Furthermore, the potential of various high throughput technologies has also been discussed in improving Si-induced multiple stress tolerance. In addition, a special emphasis is engrossed in the role of Si in achieving sustainable agricultural growth and global food security.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Two families of DNA glycosylases (YtkR2/AlkD, AlkZ/YcaQ) have been found to remove bulky and crosslinking DNA adducts produced by bacterial natural products. Whether DNA glycosylases eliminate other types of damage formed by structurally diverse antibiotics is unknown. Here, we identify four DNA glycosylases-TxnU2, TxnU4, LldU1Â and LldU5-important for biosynthesis of the aromatic polyketide antibiotics trioxacarcin A (TXNA) and LL-D49194 (LLD), and show that the enzymes provide self-resistance to the producing strains by excising the intercalated guanine adducts of TXNA and LLD. These enzymes are highly specific for TXNA/LLD-DNA lesions and have no activity toward other, less stable alkylguanines as previously described for YtkR2/AlkD and AlkZ/YcaQ. Similarly, TXNA-DNA adducts are not excised by other alkylpurine DNA glycosylases. TxnU4 and LldU1 possess unique active site motifs that provide an explanation for their tight substrate specificity. Moreover, we show that abasic (AP) sites generated from TxnU4 excision of intercalated TXNA-DNA adducts are incised by AP endonuclease less efficiently than those formed by 7mG excision. This work characterizes a distinct class of DNA glycosylase acting on intercalated DNA adducts and furthers our understanding of specific DNA repair self-resistance activities within antibiotic producers of structurally diverse, highly functionalized DNA damaging agents.",

Despite the well-established negative correlation between exploitation competition and phylogenetic distance, the process of interference competition that is exemplified by antagonism remains controversial. Here, we studied the genus Bacillus, a commonly recognized producer of multifarious antibiotics, to explore the role of phylogenetic patterns of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in mediating the relationship between antagonism and phylogeny. Comparative genomic analysis revealed a positive association between BGC distance and phylogenetic distance. Antagonistic tests demonstrated that the inhibition phenotype positively correlated with both phylogenetic and predicted BGC distance, especially for antagonistic strains possessing abundant BGCs. Mutant-based verification showed that the antagonism was dependent on the BGCs that specifically harbored by the antagonistic strain. These findings highlight that BGC-phylogeny coherence regulates the positive correlation between congeneric antagonism and phylogenetic distance, which deepens our understanding of the driving force and intrinsic mechanism of microbial interactions.",

Although the biological activity of colibactin has been extensively investigated in mammalian systems<sup>3</sup>, little is known about its effects on other microorganisms. Here we show that colibactin targets bacteria that contain prophages, and induces lytic development through the bacterial SOS response. DNA, added exogenously, protects bacteria from colibactin, as does expressing a colibactin resistance protein (ClbS) in non-colibactin-producing cells. The prophage-inducing effects that we observe apply broadly across different phage-bacteria systems and in complex communities. Finally, we identify bacteria that have colibactin resistance genes but lack colibactin biosynthetic genes. Many of these bacteria are infected with predicted prophages, and we show that the expression of their ClbS homologues provides immunity from colibactin-triggered induction. Our study reveals a mechanism by which colibactin production could affect microbiomes and highlights a role for microbial natural products in influencing population-level events such as phage outbreaks.",

The aim of this study is the characterization of the stress responses in the model aromatic-degrading bacterium Paraburkholderia xenovorans LB400 to the oxidizing agents paraquat and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.<h4>Methods</h4>Antioxidant genes were identified by bioinformatic methods in the genome of P. xenovorans LB400, and the phylogeny of its OxyR and SoxR transcriptional regulators were studied. Functionality of the transcriptional regulators from strain LB400 was assessed by complementation with LB400 SoxR of null mutant P. aeruginosa ÎsoxR, and the construction of P. xenovorans pIZoxyR that overexpresses OxyR. The effects of oxidizing agents on P. xenovorans were studied measuring bacterial susceptibility, survival and ROS formation after exposure to paraquat and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The effects of these oxidants on gene expression (qRT-PCR) and the proteome (LC-MS/MS) were quantified.<h4>Results</h4>P. xenovorans LB400 possesses a wide repertoire of genes for the antioxidant defense including the oxyR, ahpC, ahpF, kat, trxB, dpsA and gorA genes, whose orthologous genes are regulated by the transcriptional regulator OxyR in E. coli. The LB400 genome also harbors the soxR, fumC, acnA, sodB, fpr and fldX genes, whose orthologous genes are regulated by the transcriptional regulator SoxR in E. coli. The functionality of the LB400 soxR gene was confirmed by complementation of null mutant P. aeruginosa ÎsoxR. Growth, susceptibility, and ROS formation assays revealed that LB400 cells were more susceptible to paraquat than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Transcriptional analyses indicated the upregulation of the oxyR, ahpC1, katE and ohrB genes in LB400 cells after exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas the oxyR, fumC, ahpC1, sodB1 and ohrB genes were induced in presence of paraquat. Proteome analysis revealed that paraquat induced the oxidative stress response proteins AhpCF and DpsA, the universal stress protein UspA and the RNA chaperone CspA. Both oxidizing agents induced the Ohr protein, which is involved in organic peroxide resistance. Notably, the overexpression of the LB400 oxyR gene in P. xenovorans significantly decreased the ROS formation and the susceptibility to paraquat, suggesting a broad OxyR-regulated antioxidant response.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study showed that P. xenovorans LB400 possess a broad range oxidative stress response, which explain the high resistance of this strain to the oxidizing compounds paraquat and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.",

The synthesis of structures that are bioinformatically predicted to arise from uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) provides a means for synthetic chemistry to enter this process at an early stage. The recent identification of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) containing multiple Ï-aminobenzoic acids (PABAs) led us to search soil metagenomes for BGCs that polymerize PABA. Here, we use PABA-specific adenylation-domain sequences to guide the cloning of the lap BGC directly from soil. This BGC was predicted to encode a unique N-acylated PABA and thiazole containing structure. Chemical synthesis of this structure gave lapcin, a dual topoisomerase I/II inhibitor with nM to pM IC50s against diverse cancer cell lines. The discovery of lapcin highlights the power of coupling metagenomics, bioinformatics and total chemical synthesis to unlock the biosynthetic potential contained in even complex uncharacterized BGCs.",

However, the biosynthesis and transport mechanisms of these valuable compounds have not been fully resolved. Herein, based on a transcriptome analysis, gene inactivation, heterologous expression and feeding experiments, we fully explain the biosynthesis pathway of ophiobolin K in <i>Aspergillus ustus</i> 094102, especially proved to be an unclustered oxidase OblC<sub>Au</sub> that catalyzes dehydrogenation at the site of C16 and C17 of both ophiobolin F and ophiobolin C. We also find that the intermediate ophiobolin C and final product ophiobolin K could be transported into a space between the cell wall and membrane by OblD<sub>Au</sub> to avoid the inhibiting of cell growth, which is proved by a fluorescence observation of the subcellular localization and cytotoxicity tests. This study completely resolves the biosynthesis mechanism of ophiobolins in strain <i>A</i><i>. ustus</i> 094102. At the same time, it is revealed that the burden of strain growth caused by the excessive accumulation and toxicity of secondary metabolites is closely related to compartmentalized biosynthesis.",

The research shows that the REE content in rice roots, shoots and grains was significantly positive correlated with that in soil, and the dry weight of rice roots, shoots and grains was highly correlated with soil physical and chemical properties, nutrient elements and REE contents; The exploitation of rare earth minerals inhibited a-diversity of endophytic bacteria in rhizosphere, root, phyllosphere and leaf of rice, significantly reduced the abundance index, OTU number, Chao, Ace index and also significantly reduced the diversity index-Shannon index, and also reduced uniformity index: Pielou's evenness index, which caused Î²-diversity of bacteria to be quite different. The exploitation of rare earth minerals reduces the diversity of bacteria, but forms dominant bacteria, such as Burkholderia, Bacillus, Buttiauxella, Acinetobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Candida koribacter, which can degrade the pollutants formed by exploitation of rare earth minerals, alleviate the compound pollution of rare earth and ammonia nitrogen, and also has the function of fixing nitrogen and resisting rare earth stress; The content of soil available phosphorus in no-mining area is lower, and the dominant bacteria of Pantoea formed in such soil, which has the function of improving soil phosphorus availability. Rare earth elements and physical and chemical properties of soil affect the community structure of bacteria in rhizosphere and phyllosphere of rice, promote the parallel movement of some bacteria in rhizosphere, root, phyllosphere and leaf of rice, promote the construction of community structure of bacteria in rhizosphere and phyllosphere of rice, give full play to the growth promoting function of Endophytes, and promote the growth of rice. The results showed that the exploitation of rare earth minerals has formed the dominant endophytic bacteria of rice and ensured the yield of rice in the mining area, however, the mining of mineral resources causes the compound pollution of rare earth and ammonia nitrogen, which makes REE content of rice in mining area significantly higher than that in non-mining area, and the excessive rare earth element may enter the human body through the food chain and affect human health, so the food security in the REE mining area deserves more attention.",

Y1 exhibited a significant algicidal effect (86.64 Â± 5.04% at 24 h) and algicidal activity in an indirect manner. The significant declines of the maximal photosynthetic efficiency (<i>F<sub>v</sub></i>/<i>F<sub>m</sub></i>), initial slope of the light limited region (alpha), and maximum relative photosynthetic electron transfer rate (rETRmax) indicated that the Y1 filtrate inhibited photosynthetic activities of <i>A. pacificum</i>. Impaired photosynthesis induced the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caused strong oxidative damage in <i>A. pacificum</i>, ultimately inducing cell death. These findings provide a better understanding of the biological basis of complex algicidal bacterium-harmful algae interactions, providing a potential source of bacterial agent to control harmful algal blooms.",

Successful attachment of pathogenic microbes to host cells via adhesin molecules is also the first step in many devastating infections. Despite the primacy of epithelial adherence in establishing host-microbe associations, the evolutionary processes that shape this crucial interface remain enigmatic. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) encompass a multifunctional family of vertebrate cell surface proteins which are recurrent targets of bacterial adhesins at epithelial barriers. Here, we show that multiple members of the primate CEACAM family exhibit evidence of repeated natural selection at protein surfaces targeted by bacteria, consistent with pathogen-driven evolution. Divergence of CEACAM proteins between even closely related great apes is sufficient to control molecular interactions with a range of bacterial adhesins. Phylogenetic analyses further reveal that repeated gene conversion of CEACAM extracellular domains during primate divergence plays a key role in limiting bacterial adhesin host tropism. Moreover, we demonstrate that gene conversion has continued to shape CEACAM diversity within human populations, with abundant human CEACAM1 variants mediating evasion of adhesins from pathogenic <i>Neisseria</i>. Together this work reveals a mechanism by which gene conversion shapes first contact between microbes and animal hosts.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The biodiversity of microorganisms is maintained by intricate nets of interactions between competing species. Impaired functionality of human microbiomes correlates with their reduced biodiversity originating from aseptic environmental conditions and antibiotic use. Microbiomes of wild animals are free of these selective pressures. Microbiota provides a protecting shield from invasion by pathogens in the wild, outcompeting their growth in specific ecological niches. We applied ultrahigh-throughput microfluidic technologies for functional profiling of microbiomes of wild animals, including the skin beetle, Siberian lynx, common raccoon dog, and East Siberian brown bear. Single-cell screening of the most efficient killers of the common human pathogen <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> resulted in repeated isolation of <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> strains. While isolated strains had different phenotypes, all of them displayed a similar set of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding antibiotic amicoumacin, siderophore bacillibactin, and putative analogs of antimicrobials including bacilysin, surfactin, desferrioxamine, and class IId cyclical bacteriocin. Amicoumacin A (Ami) was identified as a major antibacterial metabolite of these strains mediating their antagonistic activity. Genome mining indicates that Ami BGCs with this architecture subdivide into three distinct families, characteristic of the <i>B. pumilus</i>, <i>B. subtilis</i>, and <i>Paenibacillus</i> species. While Ami itself displays mediocre activity against the majority of Gram-negative bacteria, isolated <i>B. pumilus</i> strains efficiently inhibit the growth of both Gram-positive <i>S. aureus</i> and Gram-negative <i>E. coli</i> in coculture. We believe that the expanded antagonistic activity spectrum of Ami-producing <i>B. pumilus</i> can be attributed to the metabolomic profile predetermined by their biosynthetic fingerprint. Ultrahigh-throughput isolation of natural probiotic strains from wild animal microbiomes, as well as their metabolic reprogramming, opens up a new avenue for pathogen control and microbiome remodeling in the food industry, agriculture, and healthcare.",

Despite being discovered more than 50 years ago, the biosynthetic pathway of KSM remains an unresolved puzzle. Here we report a structural and functional analysis for an epimerase, KasQ, that primes KSM biosynthesis rather than the previously proposed KasF/H, which instead acts as an acetyltransferase, inactivating KSM. Our biochemical and biophysical analysis determined that KasQ converts UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-ManNAc as the initial step in the biosynthetic pathway. The isotope-feeding study further confirmed that <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N-glucosamine/UDP-GlcNH<sub>2</sub> rather than glucose/UDP-Glc serves as the direct precursor for the formation of KSM. Both KasF and KasH were proposed, respectively, converting UDP-GlcNH<sub>2</sub> and KSM to UDP-GlcNAc and 2-N'-acetyl KSM. Experimentally, KasF is unable to do so; both KasF and KasH are instead KSM-modifying enzymes, while the latter is more specific and reactive than the former in terms of the extent of resistance. The information gained here lays the foundation for mapping out the complete KSM biosynthetic pathway.",

A direct link has been established between antimicrobial self-resistance determinants of antibiotic producers, environmental bacteria, and clinical pathogens. Natural odilorhabdins (ODLs) constitute a new family of 10-mer linear cationic peptide antibiotics inhibiting bacterial translation by binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome. These bioactive secondary metabolites are produced by entomopathogenic bacterial symbiont <i>Xenorhabdus</i> (<i>Morganellaceae</i>), vectored by the soil-dwelling nematodes. ODL-producing Xenorhabdus nematophila symbionts have mechanisms of self-protection. In this study, we cloned the 44.5-kb <i>odl</i> biosynthetic gene cluster (<i>odl</i>-BGC) of the symbiont by recombineering and showed that the <i>N</i>-acetyltransferase-encoding gene, <i>oatA</i>, is responsible for ODL resistance. <i>In vitro</i> acetylation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses showed that OatA targeted the side chain amino group of ODL rare amino acids, leading to a loss of translation inhibition and antibacterial properties.

Their chemical structures were identified by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, 2D NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry, as well as comparisons with previously reported literatures. Among them, fusariumesters CâF (<b>2</b>-<b>5</b>) are bis-alkenoic acid derivatives dimerized by an ester bond, while acetylfusaridioic acid A (<b>6</b>) and fusaridioic acid D (<b>7</b>) are alkenoic acid monomers. All the isolates were submitted to an antifungal assay against <i>Candida albicans</i> and the corn pathogen <i>Exserohilum turcicum</i> using the filter paper agar diffusion method. As a result, only compound <b>1</b> decorating with <i>Î²</i>-lactone ring turned out to be active against these two tested fungi. The broth microdilution assay against <i>Candida albicans</i> showed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of <b>1</b> to be 20Â <i>Î¼</i>g/ml, while the minimum inhibitory concentration value of the positive control (naystatin) was 10Â <i>Î¼</i>g/ml. And the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value (21.23Â <i>Î¼</i>g/ml) of <b>1</b> against <i>Exserohilum turcicum</i> was determined by analyzing its inhibition effect on the mycelial growth, using cycloheximide (IC<sub>50</sub> = 46.70Â <i>Î¼</i>g/ml) as the positive control.",

C-nucleoside antibiotics, a remarkable group of microbial natural products with diverse biological activities, feature a heterocycle base linked with a ribosyl moiety via an unusual C-glycosidic bond, and have played significant roles in healthcare and for plant protection. Elucidating how nature biosynthesizes such a group of antibiotics has provided the basis for engineered biosynthesis as well as targeted genome mining of more C-nucleoside antibiotics towards improved properties. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent advances on the biosynthesis of C-nucleoside antibiotics, and we also tentatively discuss the future developments on rationally accessing C-nucleoside diversities in a more efficient and economical way via synthetic biology strategies.",

Resistance to macrolides is often conferred by mobile resistance genes encoding Erm methyltransferases or Mph phosphotransferases. New <i>erm</i> and <i>mph</i> genes keep being discovered in clinical settings but their origins remain unknown, as is the type of macrolide resistance genes that will appear in the future. In this study, we used optimized hidden Markov models to characterize the macrolide resistome. Over 16 terabases of genomic and metagenomic data, representing a large taxonomic diversity (11 030 species) and diverse environments (1944 metagenomic samples), were searched for the presence of <i>erm</i> and <i>mph</i> genes. From this data, we predicted 28 340 macrolide resistance genes encoding 2892 unique protein sequences, which were clustered into 663 gene families (<70 % amino acid identity), of which 619 (94 %) were previously uncharacterized. This included six new resistance gene families, which were located on mobile genetic elements in pathogens. The function of ten predicted new resistance genes were experimentally validated in <i>Escherichia coli</i> using a growth assay. Among the ten tested genes, seven conferred increased resistance to erythromycin, with five genes additionally conferring increased resistance to azithromycin, showing that our models can be used to predict new functional resistance genes. Our analysis also showed that macrolide resistance genes have diverse origins and have transferred horizontally over large phylogenetic distances into human pathogens. This study expands the known macrolide resistome more than ten-fold, provides insights into its evolution, and demonstrates how computational screening can identify new resistance genes before they become a significant clinical problem.",

DynF is revealed to be a dimeric eight-stranded Î²-barrel structure with palmitic acid bound within a cavity.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of spermine (Spm) pretreatment on metabolic alterations of polyamine (PAs), Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), proline (Pro), and nitrogen associated with drought tolerance in creeping bentgrass (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>). The results showed that drought tolerance of creeping bentgrass could be significantly improved by the Spm pretreatment, as demonstrated by the maintenance of less chlorophyll loss and higher photosynthesis, gas exchange, water use efficiency, and cell membrane stability. The Spm pretreatment further increased drought-induced accumulation of endogenous PAs, putrescine, spermidine, and Spm, and also enhanced PAs metabolism through improving arginine decarboxylases, ornithine decarboxylase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, and polyamine oxidase activities during drought stress. In addition, the Spm application not only significantly improved endogenous GABA content, glutamate content, activities of glutamate decarboxylase and Î±-ketoglutarase, but also alleviated decline in nitrite nitrogen content, nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthetase, and GABA aminotransferase activities under drought stress. The Spm-pretreated creeping bentgrass exhibited significantly lower ammonia nitrogen content and nitrite reductase activity as well as higher glutamate dehydrogenase activity than non-pretreated plants in response to drought stress. These results indicated beneficial roles of the Spm on regulating GABA and nitrogen metabolism contributing towards better maintenance of Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in creeping bentgrass. Interestingly, the Spm-enhanced Pro metabolism rather than more Pro accumulation could be the key regulatory mechanism for drought tolerance in creeping bentgrass. Current findings provide a comprehensive understanding of PAs interaction with other metabolic pathways to regulate drought tolerance in grass species.",

The division of labor improves the access to nutrients and optimizes reproductive and vegetative tasks while reducing the costly production of secondary metabolites and/or of secreted enzymes. In this study, we took advantage of the possibility to isolate genetically distinct lineages deriving from the division of labor, for the isolation of heterogeneous teicoplanin producer phenotypes from <i>Actinoplanes teichomyceticus</i> ATCC 31121. In order to efficiently separate phenotypes and associated genomes, we produced and regenerated protoplasts. This approach turned out to be a rapid and effective strain improvement method, as it allowed the identification of those phenotypes in the population that produced higher teicoplanin amounts. Interestingly, a heterogeneous teicoplanin complex productivity pattern was also identified among the clones. This study suggests that strain improvement and strain maintenance should be integrated with the use of protoplasts as a strategy to unravel the hidden industrial potential of vegetative mycelium.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Complex interactions exist between microbiomes and their hosts. Increasingly, defensive metabolites that have been attributed to host biosynthetic capability are now being recognized as products of host-associated microbes. These unique metabolites often have bioactivity targets in human disease and can be purposed as pharmaceuticals. Polyketides are a complex family of natural products that often serve as defensive metabolites for competitive or pro-survival purposes for the producing organism, while demonstrating bioactivity in human diseases as cholesterol lowering agents, anti-infectives, and anti-tumor agents. Marine invertebrates and microbes are a rich source of polyketides. Palmerolide A, a polyketide isolated from the Antarctic ascidian <i>Synoicum adareanum,</i> is a vacuolar-ATPase inhibitor with potent bioactivity against melanoma cell lines. The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for production of secondary metabolites are encoded in the genomes of the producers as discrete genomic elements. A candidate palmerolide BGC was identified from a <i>S. adareanum</i> microbiome-metagenome based on a high degree of congruence with a chemical structure-based retrobiosynthetic prediction. Protein family homology analysis, conserved domain searches, active site and motif identification were used to identify and propose the function of the â¼75Â kbp <i>trans</i>-acyltransferase (AT) polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal synthase (PKS-NRPS) domains responsible for the stepwise synthesis of palmerolide A. Though PKS systems often act in a predictable co-linear sequence, this BGC includes multiple <i>trans</i>-acting enzymatic domains, a non-canonical condensation termination domain, a bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM), and is found in multiple copies within the metagenome-assembled genome (MAG). Detailed inspection of the five highly similar <i>pal</i> BGC copies suggests the potential for biosynthesis of other members of the palmerolide chemical family. This is the first delineation of a biosynthetic gene cluster from an Antarctic microbial species, recently proposed as <i>Candidatus</i> Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus. These findings have relevance for fundamental knowledge of PKS combinatorial biosynthesis and could enhance drug development efforts of palmerolide A through heterologous gene expression.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Pesticides are used indiscriminately all over the world to protect crops from pests and pathogens. If they are used in excess, they contaminate the soil and water bodies and negatively affect human health and the environment. However, bioremediation is the most viable option to deal with these pollutants, but it has certain limitations. Therefore, harnessing the role of microbial biosurfactants in pesticide remediation is a promising approach. Biosurfactants are the amphiphilic compounds that can help to increase the bioavailability of pesticides, and speeds up the bioremediation process. Biosurfactants lower the surface area and interfacial tension of immiscible fluids and boost the solubility and sorption of hydrophobic pesticide contaminants. They have the property of biodegradability, low toxicity, high selectivity, and broad action spectrum under extreme pH, temperature, and salinity conditions, as well as a low critical micelle concentration (CMC). All these factors can augment the process of pesticide remediation. Application of metagenomic and <i>in-silico</i> tools would help by rapidly characterizing pesticide degrading microorganisms at a taxonomic and functional level. A comprehensive review of the literature shows that the role of biosurfactants in the biological remediation of pesticides has received limited attention. Therefore, this article is intended to provide a detailed overview of the role of various biosurfactants in improving pesticide remediation as well as different methods used for the detection of microbial biosurfactants. Additionally, this article covers the role of advanced metagenomics tools in characterizing the biosurfactant producing pesticide degrading microbes from different environments.",

Given their relevance, it is important to analyze the genetic and metabolic diversity of the species of this section. We sequenced the genome of <i>Aspergillus affinis</i> CMG 70, isolated from sea water, and compared it with the genomes of species from section <i>Circumdati</i>, including <i>A. affinis</i>'s strain type. The <i>A. affinis</i> genome was characterized considering secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and transporters. To uncover the biosynthetic potential of <i>A. affinis</i> CMG 70, an untargeted metabolomics (LC-MS/MS) approach was used. Cultivating the fungus in the presence and absence of sea salt showed that <i>A. affinis</i> CMG 70 metabolite profiles are salt dependent. Analyses of the methanolic crude extract revealed the presence of both unknown and well-known <i>Aspergillus</i> compounds, such as ochratoxin A, anti-viral (e.g., 3,5-Di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid and epigallocatechin), anti-bacterial (e.g., 3-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol, l-pyroglutamic acid, lecanoric acid), antifungal (e.g., lpyroglutamic acid, 9,12,13-Trihydroxyoctadec-10-enoic acid, hydroxyferulic acid), and chemotherapeutic (e.g., daunomycinone, mitoxantrone) related metabolites. Comparative analysis of 17 genomes from 16 <i>Aspergillus</i> species revealed abundant CAZymes (568 per species), secondary metabolite BGCs (73 per species), and transporters (1359 per species). Some BGCs are highly conserved in this section (e.g., pyranonigrin E and UNII-YC2Q1O94PT (ACR toxin I)), while others are incomplete or completely lost among species (e.g., bikaverin and chaetoglobosins were found exclusively in series <i>Sclerotiorum</i>, while asperlactone seemed completely lost). The results of this study, including genome analysis and metabolome characterization, emphasize the molecular diversity of <i>A. affinis</i> CMG 70, as well as of other species in the section <i>Circumdati</i>.",

These interactions are essential for understanding anti-infective immunity as well as pathogenesis. In this study, the host-pathogen interaction was analyzed using a model of acute infection where channel catfish were infected with <i>Yersinia ruckeri</i>. The infected fish showed signs of body surface hyperemia as well as hyperemia and swelling in the trunk kidney. Double RNA sequencing was performed on trunk kidneys extracted from infected channel catfish and transcriptome data was compared with data from uninfected trunk kidneys. Results revealed that the host-pathogen interaction was dynamically regulated and that the host-pathogen transcriptome fluctuated during infection. More specifically, these data revealed that the expression levels of immune genes involved in Cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling and other immune-related pathways were significantly upregulated. <i>Y. ruckeri</i> mainly promote pathogenesis through the flagellum gene fli<i>C</i> in channel catfish. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) R package was used to reveal that the infection of catfish is closely related to metabolic pathways. This study contributes to the understanding of the host-pathogen interaction between channel catfish and Y. ruckeri, more specifically how catfish respond to infection through a transcriptional perspective and how this infection leads to enteric red mouth disease (ERM) in these fish.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a structurally diverse group of natural products. They feature a wide range of intriguing post-translational modifications, as exemplified by the biarylitides. These are a family of cyclic tripeptides found in <i>Planomonospora</i>, carrying a biaryl linkage between two aromatic amino acids. Recent genomic analyses revealed that the minimal biosynthetic prerequisite of biarylitide biosynthesis consists of only one ribosomally synthesized pentapeptide precursor as the substrate and a modifying cytochrome-P450-dependent enzyme. In silico analyses revealed that minimal biarylitide RiPP clusters are widespread among natural product producers across phylogenetic borders, including myxobacteria. We report here the genome-guided discovery of the first myxobacterial biarylitide MeYLH, termed Myxarylin, from <i>Pyxidicoccus fallax</i> An d48. Myxarylin was found to be an <i>N</i>-methylated tripeptide that surprisingly exhibits a C-N biaryl crosslink. In contrast to Myxarylin, previously isolated biarylitides are <i>N</i>-acetylated tripeptides that feature a C-C biaryl crosslink. Furthermore, the formation of Myxarylin was confirmed by the heterologous expression of the identified biosynthetic genes in <i>Myxococcus xanthus</i> DK1622. These findings expand the structural and biosynthetic scope of biarylitide-type RiPPs and emphasize the distinct biochemistry found in the myxobacterial realm.",

Foremost among these diseases is tuberculosis. Assessment of the antimycobacterial activity of nargenicin, a natural product that targets the replicative DNA polymerase of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, revealed that it is a bactericidal genotoxin that induces a DNA damage response in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) and inhibits growth by blocking the replicative DNA polymerase, DnaE1. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that binding of nargenicin to <i>Mtb</i> DnaE1 requires the DNA substrate such that nargenicin is wedged between the terminal base pair and the polymerase and occupies the position of both the incoming nucleotide and templating base. Comparative analysis across three bacterial species suggests that the activity of nargenicin is partly attributable to the DNA binding affinity of the replicative polymerase.

There is no panacea for the antibacterial resistance crisis; instead, a multifaceted approach is called for. In this Perspective we make the case that, in the face of evolving clinical needs and enabling technologies, numerous validated antibacterial targets and associated lead molecules deserve a second look. At the same time, many worthy targets lack good leads despite harboring druggable active sites. Creative and inspired techniques buoy discovery efforts; while soil screening efforts frequently lead to antibiotic rediscovery, researchers have found success searching for new antibiotic leads by studying underexplored ecological niches or by leveraging the abundance of available data from genome mining efforts. The judicious use of \"polypharmacology\" (i.e., the ability of a drug to alter the activities of multiple targets) can also provide new opportunities, as can the continued search for inhibitors of resistance enzymes with the capacity to breathe new life into old antibiotics. We conclude by highlighting available pharmacoeconomic models for antibacterial discovery and development while making the case for new ones.",

In this article, the following discoveries will be outlined: (1) AGR profiles correlating with the productivity of AGs in AG-producers, (2) Wide distribution of multiple AG resistance in AG-nonproducing actinomycetes, (3) Involvement of ribosomal resistance and AG-acetylating enzymes as underlying AGR factors, (4) Activation by single nucleotide substitution of a silent gene coding for aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase, AAC(3), in S. griseus, (5) Discovery of a novel antibiotic indolizomycin through protoplast fusion treatment between S. tenjimariensis and S. griseus strains with different AGR phenotypes, and (6) Double stage-acting activity of arbekacin (ABK; an anti-MRSA semisynthetic AG) discovered by acetylation of ABK with cloned AACs; that is both ABK and its acetylated derivatives showed remarkable antibiotic activities.",

Argyrins are formed by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), originating from the myxobacterial producer strains Archangium gephyra Ar8082 and Cystobacter sp. SBCb004. In this work, a previously established heterologous production platform was employed to provide evidence of direct D-configured amino acid incorporation by the argyrin assembly line. An adenylation domain of the argyrin NRPS was characterized and shown to have a high preference for D-configured amino acids. Eight novel argyrin derivatives were generated via biosynthetic engineering of the heterologous production system. The system was also optimized to enable formation of methylated argyrin C and D derivatives with improved immunosuppressive activity compared with their unmethylated counterparts. Furthermore, the optimization of cultivation conditions allowed exclusive production of one major derivative at a time, drastically improving the purification process. Importantly, engineering of transcription and translation initiation resulted in a substantially improved production titre reaching 350-400âmgâl<sup>-1</sup> . The optimized system presented herein thus provides a versatile platform for production of this promising class of immunosuppressants at a scale that should provide sufficient supply for upcoming pre-clinical development.",

Since compound identification and characterization remain bottlenecks, a major challenge is prioritizing promising BGCs. Recently, researchers adopted self-resistance based strategies allowing them to predict the biological activities of natural products encoded by uncharacterized BGCs. Since 2017, the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS) facilitated this so-called target-directed genome mining (TDGM) approach for the prioritization of BGCs encoding potentially novel antibiotics. Here, we present the ARTS database, available at https://arts-db.ziemertlab.com/. The ARTS database provides pre-computed ARTS results for >70,000 genomes and metagenome assembled genomes in total. Advanced search queries allow users to rapidly explore the fundamental criteria of TDGM such as BGC proximity, duplication and horizontal gene transfers of essential housekeeping genes.

As microbial genome mining has matured in recent years, unvalidated conjectures about what microbes to pursue, how to identify legitimate secondary metabolite BGCs, and how to sequence DNA to satisfactory levels of completion have been identified. The solutions to correct the misconceptions around these topics are beginning to be implemented.",

Toxic metals and metalloids have exerted selective pressure on life since the rise of the first organisms on the Earth, which has led to the evolution and acquisition of resistance mechanisms against them, as well as mechanisms to weaponize them. Microorganisms exploit antimicrobial metals and metalloids to gain competitive advantage over other members of microbial communities. This exerts a strong selective pressure that drives evolution of resistance. This review describes, with a focus on arsenic and copper, how microorganisms exploit metals and metalloids for predation and how metal- and metalloid-dependent predation may have been a driving force for evolution of microbial resistance against metals and metalloids.",

Recent advancements in multi-omics techniques have uncovered cryptic gene clusters within the genomes of actinomycetes, potentially introducing vast resources for the investigation of bioactive molecules. While developments in culture techniques have allowed for the fermentation of difficult-to-culture actinomycetes, high-throughput metabolite screening has offered plenary tools to accelerate hits discovery. A variety of new bioactive molecules have been isolated from actinomycetes of unique environmental origins, such as endophytic and symbiotic actinomycetes.

However, the yield of edeines in wild-type (WT) Brevibacillus is extremely low, and chemical synthesis of edeines is a time-consuming process. Genetic engineering has proven to be an effective approach to produce antibiotics with high yield. In this study, the edeine biosynthetic gene cluster (ede BGC), which is involved in edeine production, was identified and characterized in Brevibacillus brevis X23. To improve edeine production in B. brevis X23, the ede BGC promoter was replaced with six different promoters, P<sub>mwp</sub> , P<sub>spc</sub> , P<sub>xylA</sub> , P<sub>shuttle-09</sub> , P<sub>grac</sub> or P<sub>43</sub> , through double-crossover homologous recombination. The new promoters significantly increased the expression of the ede BGC as well as edeine production by 2.9âÂ±â0.4 to 20.5âÂ±â1.2-fold and 3.6âÂ±â0.1to 8.7âÂ±â0.7-fold respectively.

With a view to providing a rapid means for deselecting antibacterial drug candidates that fail to meet this requirement, we report here the generation and application of a platform for detecting cross-resistance between established and novel antibacterial agents.<h4>Methods</h4>This first iteration of the cross-resistance platform (CRP) consists of 28 strains of defined resistance genotype, established in a uniform genetic background (the SH1000 strain of the clinically significant pathogen Staphylococcus aureus). Most CRP members were engineered through introduction of constitutively expressed resistance determinants on a low copy-number plasmid, with a smaller number selected as spontaneous resistant mutants.<h4>Results</h4>Members of the CRP collectively exhibit resistance to many of the major classes of antibacterial agent in use. We employed the CRP to test two antibiotics that have been proposed in the literature as potential drug candidates: Î³-actinorhodin and batumin. No cross-resistance was detected for Î³-actinorhodin, whilst a CRP member resistant to triclosan exhibited a 32-fold reduction in susceptibility to batumin. Thus, a resistance phenotype that already exists in clinical strains mediates profound resistance to batumin, implying that this compound is not a promising antibacterial drug candidate.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By detecting cross-resistance between established and novel antibacterial agents, the CRP offers the ability to deselect compounds whose activity is substantially impaired by existing resistance mechanisms. The CRP therefore represents a useful addition to the antibacterial drug discovery toolbox.",

Flow cytometry (including fluorescence-activated cell sorting) is one of the most versatile and high-throughput approaches for single-cell analysis by detecting multiple fluorescence parameters of individual cells in aqueous suspension as they flow past through a focus of excitation lasers. However, this approach relies on the expression of cell surface and intracellular biomarkers, which inevitably lacks spatial and temporal phenotypes and activities of cells, such as secreted proteins, extracellular metabolite production, and proliferation. Droplet microfluidics has recently emerged as a powerful tool for the encapsulation and manipulation of thousands to millions of individual cells within pico-litre microdroplets. Integrating flow cytometry with microdroplet architectures surrounded by aqueous solutions (<i>e.g.</i>, water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsion and hydrogel droplets) opens avenues for new cellular assays linking cell phenotypes to genotypes at the single-cell level. In this review, we discuss the capabilities and applications of droplet flow cytometry (DFC). This unique technique uses standard commercially available flow cytometry instruments to characterise or select individual microdroplets containing single cells of interest. We explore current challenges associated with DFC and present our visions for future development.",

To elucidate their functions, the fomA and fomB genes were overexpressed in E. coli and the gene products were characterized. The recombinant FomA protein converted fosfomycin to fosfomycin monophosphate, which was inactive on E. coli, in the presence of a magnesium ion and ATP. On the other hand, the recombinant FomB protein did not inactivate fosfomycin. However, a reaction mixture containing FomA and FomB proteins converted fosfomycin to fosfomycin monophosphate and fosfomycin diphosphate in the presence of ATP and a magnesium ion, indicating that FomA and FomB catalyzed phosphorylations of fosfomycin and fosfomycin monophosphate, respectively. These results suggest that the self-resistance mechanism of the fosfomycin-producing organism S. wedmorensis is mono- and diphosphorylation of the phosphonate function of fosfomycin catalyzed by FomA and FomB.",

Nine open reading frames (ORFs) associated with clavulanic acid biosynthesis were located in a 15-kb segment of the supercluster, including six ORFs encoding known biosynthetic enzymes or regulatory proteins, two ORFs that have been reported previously but whose involvement in clavulanic acid biosynthesis is unclear, and one ORF not previously reported. Evidence for the involvement of these ORFs in clavulanic acid production was obtained by generating mutants and showing that all were defective for clavulanic acid production when grown on starch asparagine medium. However, when five of the nine mutants, including mutants defective in known clavulanic acid biosynthetic enzymes, were grown in a soy-based medium, clavulanic acid-producing ability was restored. This ability to produce clavulanic acid when seemingly essential biosynthetic enzymes have been mutated suggests that paralogous genes encoding functionally equivalent proteins exist for each of the five genes but that these paralogues are expressed only in the soy-based medium. The five genes that have paralogues encode proteins involved in the early steps of the pathway common to the biosynthesis of both clavulanic acid and the other clavam metabolites produced by this organism. No evidence was seen for paralogues of the four remaining genes involved in late, clavulanic acid-specific steps in the pathway.",

The C-1027 chromophore could be viewed as being derived biosynthetically from a benzoxazolinate, a deoxyamino hexose, a beta-amino acid, and an enediyne core. By adopting a strategy for cloning of the C-1027 biosynthesis gene cluster by mapping a putative dNDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (NGDH) gene to cagA, we have localized 75 kb of contiguous DNA from S. globisporus. DNA sequence analysis of two regions of the cloned gene cluster revealed two genes, sgcA and sgcB, that encode an NGDH enzyme and a transmembrane efflux protein, respectively, and confirmed that the cagA gene resides approximately 14 kb upstream of the sgcAB locus. The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in C-1027 biosynthesis was demonstrated by disrupting the sgcA gene to generate C-1027-nonproducing mutants and by complementing the sgcA mutants in vivo to restore C-1027 production. These results represent the first cloning of a gene cluster for enediyne antitumor antibiotic biosynthesis and provide a starting point for future genetic and biochemical investigations of C-1027 biosynthesis.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Macrolactins, a type of macrolide antibiotic, are toxic to the producer strains. As such, its level is usually maintained below the lethal concentration during the fermentation process. To improve the production of macrolactins, we applied adaptive laboratory evolution technology to engineer a saline-resistant mutant strain. The hypothesis that strains with saline resistance show improved macrolactins production was investigated.<h4>Results</h4>Using saline stress as a selective pressure, we engineered a mutant strain with saline resistance coupled with enhanced macrolactins production within 60Â days using a self-made device. As compared with the parental strain, the evolved strain produced macrolactins with 11.93% improvement in non-saline stress fermentation medium containing 50Â g/L glucose, when the glucose concentration increased to 70Â g/L, the evolved strain produced macrolactins with 71.04% improvement. RNA sequencing and metabolomics results revealed that amino acid metabolism was involved in the production of macrolactins in the evolved strain. Furthermore, genome sequencing of the evolved strain revealed a candidate mutation, hisD<sup>D41Y</sup>, that was causal for the improved MLNs production, it was 3.42 times higher than the control in the overexpression hisD<sup>D41Y</sup> strain. Results revealed that saline resistance protected the producer strain from feedback inhibition of end-product (macrolide antibiotic), resulting in enhanced MLNs production.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In the present work, we successfully engineered a mutant strain with enhanced macrolactins production by adaptive laboratory evolution using saline stress as a selective pressure. Based on physiological, transcriptomic and genetic analysis, amino acid metabolism was found to benefit macrolactins production improvement. Our strategy might be applicable to improve the production of other kinds of macrolide antibiotics and other toxic compounds. The identification of the hisD mutation will allow for the deduction of metabolic engineering strategies in future research.",

Thereby, genome sequence-driven mining strategies are often superior to wet-lab experiments because they are generally faster and less resource-intensive. In the current study, we report on the development of a novel <i>in silico</i> screening approach to evaluate the genetic potential of bacterial strains to produce protein synthesis inhibitors (PSI), which was termed the protein synthesis inhibitor ('psi') target gene footprinting approach = Î¨-footprinting. The strategy is based on the occurrence of protein synthesis associated self-resistance genes in genome sequences of natural compound producers. The screening approach was applied to 406 genome sequences of actinomycetes strains from the DSMZ strain collection, resulting in the prioritization of 15 potential PSI producer strains. For twelve of them, extract samples showed protein synthesis inhibitory properties in <i>in vitro</i> transcription/translation assays. For four strains, namely <i>Saccharopolyspora flava</i> DSM 44771, <i>Micromonospora aurantiaca</i> DSM 43813, <i>Nocardioides albertanoniae</i> DSM 25218, and <i>Geodermatophilus nigrescens</i> DSM 45408, the protein synthesis inhibitory substance amicoumacin was identified by HPLC-MS analysis, which proved the functionality of the <i>in silico</i> screening approach.",

To reveal this, we investigate chromatin dynamics in parthenogenetic, androgenic, and several types of male germ cells-fertilized zygotes. Here we illustrate that parental conflicting role mediates the regulation of chromatin dynamics. Sperm reduces chromatin dynamics in both parental pronuclei (PNs). During spermiogenesis, male germ cells acquire this reducing ability and its resistance. On the other hand, oocytes can increase chromatin dynamics. Notably, the oocytes-derived chromatin dynamics enhancing ability is dominant for the sperm-derived opposing one. This maternal enhancing ability is competed between parental pronuclei. Delayed fertilization timing is critical for this competition and compromises parental asymmetric chromatin dynamics and zygotic transcription. Together, parental competition for the maternal factor enhancing chromatin dynamics is a determinant to establish parental asymmetry, and paternal repressive effects have supporting roles to enhance asymmetry.",

The fluoroquinolone resistance in <i>S. maltophilia</i> is usually caused by an overproduction of efflux pumps. In this study, the contribution of efflux systems to levofloxacin resistance in <i>S. maltophilia</i> clinical isolates was demonstrated using phenotypic (minimal inhibitory concentrations, MICs, of antibiotics determination Â± efflux pump inhibitors, EPIs) and molecular (real-time polymerase-chain-reaction and sequencing) methods. Previously, the occurrence of genes encoding ten efflux pumps was shown in 94 studied isolates. Additionally, 44/94 isolates demonstrated reduction in susceptibility to levofloxacin. Only 5 of 13 isolates (with â¥4-fold reduction in levofloxacin MIC) in the presence of EPIs showed an increased susceptibility to levofloxacin and other antibiotics. The overexpression of <i>smeD</i> and <i>smeV</i> genes (in five and one isolate, respectively) of 5 tested efflux pump operons was demonstrated. Sequencing analysis revealed 20-35 nucleotide mutations in local regulatory genes such as <i>smeT</i> and <i>smeRv</i>. However, mutations leading to an amino acid change were shown only in <i>smeT</i> (Arg123Lys, Asp182Glu, Asp204Glu) for one isolate and in <i>smeRv</i> (Gly266Ser) for the other isolate. Our data indicate that the overproduction of the SmeVWX efflux system, unlike SmeDEF, plays a significant role in the levofloxacin resistance.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The genus <i>Streptomyces</i> is known to harbor numerous biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of potential utility in synthetic biology applications. However, it is often difficult to link uncharacterized BGCs with the secondary metabolites they produce. Proteomining refers to the strategy of identifying active BGCs by correlating changes in protein expression with the production of secondary metabolites of interest. In this study, we devised a shotgun proteomics-based workflow to identify active BGCs during fermentation when a variety of compounds are being produced. Mycelia harvested during the non-producing growth phase served as the background. Proteins that were differentially expressed were clustered based on the proximity of the genes in the genome to highlight active BGCs systematically from label-free quantitative proteomics data. Our software tool is easy-to-use and requires only 1 point of comparison where natural product biosynthesis was significantly different. We tested our proteomining clustering method on three <i>Streptomyces</i> species producing different compounds. In <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> A3(2), we detected the BGCs of calcium-dependent antibiotic, actinorhodin, undecylprodigiosin, and coelimycin P1. In <i>Streptomyces chrestomyceticus</i> BCC24770, 7 BGCs were identified. Among them, we independently re-discovered the type II PKS for albofungin production previously identified by genome mining and tedious heterologous expression experiments. In <i>Streptomyces tenebrarius</i>, 5 BGCs were detected, including the known apramycin and tobramycin BGC as well as a newly discovered caerulomycin A BGC in this species. The production of caerulomycin A was confirmed by LC-MS and the inactivation of the caerulomycin A BGC surprisingly had a significant impact on the secondary metabolite regulation of <i>S. tenebrarius</i>. In conclusion, we developed an unbiased, high throughput proteomics-based method to complement genome mining methods for the identification of biosynthetic pathways in <i>Streptomyces</i> sp.",

After alleviation of CCR, the RNA CrcZ sequesters Hfq/Crc, which leads to a rewiring of gene expression to ensure the consumption of less preferred carbon and nitrogen sources. Here, we performed a multiomics approach by assessing the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome in parallel in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strain O1 during and after relief of CCR. As Hfq function is impeded by the RNA CrcZ upon relief of CCR, and Hfq is known to impact antibiotic susceptibility in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, emphasis was laid on links between CCR and antibiotic susceptibility. To this end, we show that the <i>mexGHI-opmD</i> operon encoding an efflux pump for the antibiotic norfloxacin and the virulence factor 5-Methyl-phenazine is upregulated after alleviation of CCR, resulting in a decreased susceptibility to the antibiotic norfloxacin.

Here, we show that after exposure to FB1 and AFB1, mitochondrial respiration significantly decreased by measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The current work shows that the integrity of mitochondria (MMP and ROS), that is the central component of cell apoptosis, is disrupted by FB1 and AFB1 in undifferentiated Caco-2 and HepG2 cells as in vitro models for human intestine and liver, respectively. It hypothesizes that FB1 and AFB1 could disrupt the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and break the balance of transferring H<sup>+</sup> between the mitochondrial inner membrane and mitochondrial matrix, however, the proton leak is not increasing and, as a result, ATP synthesis is blocked. At the sub-toxic exposure of 1.0 Âµg/mL for 24 h, i.e., a viability of 95% in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells, the mitochondrial respiration was, however, stimulated. This suggests that the treated cells could reserve energy for mitochondrial respiration with the exposure of FB1 and AFB1, which could be a survival advantage.",

Current studies show that scientific exercise can effectively improve learning and memory capacity, which also can provide benefits for obese people. However, the underlying mechanisms for the improvement of cognitive capacity under the status of obesity still need to be further explored. In the present study, the obesity-induced cognition-declined model was established using 4-week-old mice continuously fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, and then the model mice were subjected to an 8-week swimming intervention and corresponding evaluation of relevant indicators, including cognitive capacity, inflammation, insulin signal pathway, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF), and apoptosis, for exploring potential regulatory mechanisms. Compared with the mice fed with regular diets, the obese mice revealed the impairment of cognitive capacity; in contrast, swimming intervention ameliorated the decline in cognitive capacity of obese mice by reducing inflammatory factors, inhibiting the JNK/IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signal pathway, and activating the PGC-1Î±/BDNF signal pathway, thereby suppressing the apoptosis of neurons. Therefore, swimming may be an important interventional strategy to compensate for obesity-induced cognitive impairment.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The biosynthesis of the natural product dehydrofosmidomycin involves an unusual transformation in which 2-(trimethylamino)ethylphosphonate is rearranged, desaturated and demethylated by the enzyme DfmD, a divergent member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. Although other members of this enzyme family catalyze superficially similar transformations, the combination of all three reactions in a single enzyme has not previously been observed. By characterizing the products of in vitro reactions with labeled and unlabeled substrates, we show that DfmD performs this transformation in two steps, with the first involving desaturation of the substrate to form 2-(trimethylamino)vinylphosphonate, and the second involving rearrangement and demethylation to form methyldehydrofosmidomycin. These data reveal significant differences from the desaturation and rearrangement reactions catalyzed by other family members.",

Here we report on the application of metabolomic tools to the genus <i>Actinoallomurus</i>, a poorly explored member of the Actinobacteria. From examining extracts derived from 88 isolates belonging to this genus, we identified a family of cyclodepsipeptides acylated with a C<sub>20</sub> polyketide chain, which we named allopeptimicins. These molecules possess unusual structural features, including several double bonds in the amino-polyketide chain and four non-proteinogenic amino acids in the octapeptide. Remarkably, allopeptimicins are produced as a complex of active and inactive congeners, the latter carrying a sulfate group on the polyketide amine. This modification is also a mechanism of self-protection in the producer strain. The structural uniqueness of allopeptimicins is reflected in a biosynthetic gene cluster showing a mosaic structure, with dedicated gene cassettes devoted to formation of specialized precursors and modular assembly lines related to those from different pathways.",

IVM sensitive and resistant <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> strains were recently reported. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of resistance are unknown. Clinical isolates of <i>S. aureus</i> were used for determination of the sensitivities against IVM by growth curve analysis and time-kill kinetics. Then, proteomic, and biochemical approaches were applied to investigate the possible mechanisms of resistance. Proteomic results showed a total of 1849 proteins in the dataset for both strains, 425 unique proteins in strain O9 (IVM sensitive), and 354 unique proteins in strain O20 (IVM resistant). Eight proteins with transport functions were differentially expressed in the IVM resistant strain. Among them, three efflux pumps (<i>mepA</i>, <i>emrB</i>, and <i>swrC</i>) were confirmed by qPCR. The IVM resistant <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> may overexpress these proteins as a key resistance determinant. Further experiments are required to confirm the exact mechanistic relationship. Nevertheless, the possibility of blocking these transporters to reverse or delay the onset of resistance and reduce selection pressure is potentially appealing.",

Here, we use transposon mutagenesis and sequencing (TnSeq) to perform a high-throughput screen for candidate genes required for swarming. The TnSeq approach identified all of the known genes required for flagellar biosynthesis and nearly all of the previously reported regulators that promote swarming. Moreover, we identified an additional 36 genes that improve swarming and validated them individually. Among these, two mutants with severe defects were recovered, including <i>fliT</i>, required for flagellar biosynthesis, and a gene of unknown function, <i>yolB</i>, whose defect could not be attributed to a lack of flagella. In addition to discovering additional genes required for B. subtilis swarming, our work validates TnSeq as a powerful approach for comprehensively identifying genes important for nonessential processes such as colony expansion on plates. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> In TnSeq, transposons are randomly inserted throughout the chromosome at a population level, but insertions that disrupt genes of essential function cause strains that carry them to fall out of the population and appear underrepresented at the sequence level. Here, we apply TnSeq to the nonessential phenotype of motility in B. subtilis and spatially select for cells proficient in swarming. We find that insertions in nearly all genes previously identified as required for swarming are underrepresented in TnSeq analysis, and we identify 36 additional genes that enhance swarming. We demonstrate that TnSeq is a powerful tool for the genetic analysis of motility and likely other nonlethal screens for which enrichment is strong.",

Furthermore, the large proportion of marine microorganisms are either uncultivable or cannot be genetically manipulated. Efficient heterologous expression systems can activate cryptic BGCs and increase target compound yield, allowing researchers to explore more unknown MNPs.

However, the pathogenic mechanism of DOX and the role of miRNA in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remain to be further studied. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-199 in DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity. A mouse model of myocardial cell injury induced by DOX was established. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression changes of miR-199 and TATA-binding protein associated factor 9B (TAF9b) in DOX-induced cardiac injury. Cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins, namely, Bax and Bcl-2, were detected by qPCR. The expression of Beclin-1 and LC3b was detected by western blotting. The binding effect of miR-199 with TAF9b was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In this study, overexpression of miR-199 could promote cardiotoxicity. Inhibition of miR-199 could alleviate DOX-mediated myocardial injury. Further studies showed that miR-199 targeted TAF9b. Moreover, miR-199 promoted apoptosis of myocardial cells and aggravated autophagy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TAF9B knockdown reversed the myocardial protective effect of miR-199 inhibitors. Therefore, miR-199 promoted DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity by targeting TAF9b, thereby aggravating apoptosis and regulating autophagy.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The human society faces a serious problem due to the widespread resistance to antibiotics in clinical practice. Most antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters in actinobacteria contain genes for intrinsic self-resistance to the produced antibiotics, and it has been proposed that the antibiotic resistance genes in pathogenic bacteria originated in antibiotic-producing microorganisms. The model actinobacteria <i>Streptomyces clavuligerus</i> produces the Î²-lactam antibiotic cephamycin C, a class A Î²-lactamase, and the Î² lactamases inhibitor clavulanic acid, all of which are encoded in a gene supercluster; in addition, it synthesizes the Î²-lactamase inhibitory protein BLIP. The secreted clavulanic acid has a synergistic effect with the cephamycin produced by the same strain in the fight against competing microorganisms in its natural habitat. High levels of resistance to cephamycin/cephalosporin in actinobacteria are due to the presence (in their Î²-lactam clusters) of genes encoding PBPs which bind penicillins but not cephalosporins. We have revised the previously reported cephamycin C and clavulanic acid gene clusters and, in addition, we have searched for novel Î²-lactam gene clusters in protein databases. Notably, in <i>S. clavuligerus</i> and <i>Nocardia lactamdurans</i>, the Î²-lactamases are retained in the cell wall and do not affect the intracellular formation of isopenicillin N/penicillin N. The activity of the Î²-lactamase in <i>S. clavuligerus</i> may be modulated by the Î²-lactamase inhibitory protein BLIP at the cell-wall level. Analysis of the Î²-lactam cluster in actinobacteria suggests that these clusters have been moved by horizontal gene transfer between different actinobacteria and have culminated in <i>S. clavuligerus</i> with the organization of an elaborated set of genes designed for fine tuning of antibiotic resistance and cell wall remodeling for the survival of this <i>Streptomyces</i> species. This article is focused specifically on the enigmatic connection between Î²-lactam biosynthesis and Î²-lactam resistance mechanisms in the producer actinobacteria.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antibiotic-producing microorganisms usually require one or more self-resistance determinants to survive antibiotic production. The effectors of these mechanisms are proteins that inactivate the antibiotic, facilitate its transport, or modify the target to render it insensitive to the molecule. Streptomyces bacteria biosynthesize various bioactive natural products and possess resistance systems for most metabolites, which are coregulated with antibiotic biosynthesis genes. Streptomyces olindensis strain DAUFPE 5622 produces the antitumor antibiotic cosmomycin D (COSD), a member of the anthracycline family. In this study, we propose three self-resistance mechanisms, anchored or based in the COSD biosynthetic gene cluster. These include <i>cosIJ</i> (an ABC transporter), <i>cosU</i> (a UvrA class IIa protein), and a new self-resistance mechanism encoded by <i>cosP</i>, which shows response against peroxides by the enzyme mycothiol peroxidase (MPx). Activity-based investigations of MPx and its mutant enzyme confirmed peroxidation during the production of COSD. Overexpression of the ABC transporter, the UvrA class IIa protein, and the MPx led to an effective response against toxic anthracyclines, such as cosmomycins. Our findings help to understand how thiol peroxidases play an antioxidant role in the anthracycline producer S. olindensis DAUFPE 5622, a mechanism which has been reported for neoplastic cells that are resistant to doxorubicin (DOX). <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Anthracycline compounds are DNA intercalating agents widely used in cancer chemotherapeutic protocols. This work focused on the self-resistance mechanisms developed by the cosmomycin-producing bacterium Streptomyces olindensis. Our findings showed that cysteine peroxidases, such as mycothiol peroxidase, encoded by the gene <i>cosP</i>, protected S. olindensis against peroxidation during cosmomycin production. This observation can contribute to much better understanding of resistance both in the producers, eventually enhancing production, and in some tumoral cell lines.",

Plant extracts were screened for growth inhibitory activity, and then a thin-layer chromatography bioautography assay was conducted. This located the major antileukemic compounds <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> in the extracts. Once the active compounds were located, they were extracted and purified, and their structures were determined. The growth inhibitory activity of the purified compounds showed a significant correlation with their antileukemic activity. The proposed approach is rapid, inexpensive, and can easily be implemented in areas of the world with high biodiversity but with less access to advanced facilities and biological assays.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The time-of-day influence on neuromuscular function is well-documented, but important details remain elusive. It is currently unknown whether males and females differ in their diurnal variation for optimal neuromuscular performance. The purpose of this study is to identify the time-of-day influence on neuromuscular function between sexes and determine whether these responses differ for the upper versus lower limbs. A group of males (nÂ =Â 12) and females (nÂ =Â 15) completed neuromuscular performance testing in the morning (07:00-09:00) and evening (17:00-19:00) on separate days in a randomized order. Maximal force, the normalized rate of force development, EMG, normalized EMG rise, and submaximal force steadiness were compared between morning and evening hours. The main findings show that maximal force was greater in the evening for the knee extensors (dÂ =Â 0.570, pÂ <Â 0.01) but not the elbow flexors (dÂ =Â 0.212, pÂ =Â 0.281), whereas maximal muscle excitation was greater in the evening for the biceps brachii (dÂ =Â 0.348, pÂ <Â 0.01) but not the vastus lateralis (dÂ =Â 0.075, pÂ =Â 0.526) with no influence of sex. However, force steadiness during knee extension was superior in the evening versus the morning for males (dÂ =Â 0.734, pÂ =Â 0.025) and compared to evening values for females (gÂ =Â 1.19, pÂ =Â 0.032). Overall, these findings show that time-of-day affects the knee extensors more than the elbow flexors and that diurnal variability between sexes appears to be task-dependent.",

It is worth identifying the involved exporter genes for further titer improvement. In this study, a titer gradient was achieved by varying soybean oil concentrations in a fermentation medium, and the corresponding transcriptomes were studied. Comparative transcriptomic analysis identified eight putative transporter genes, whose transcription increased when the oil content was increased and ranked top among up-regulated genes at higher oil concentrations. All eight genes were proved to be positively involved in salinomycin export through gene deletion and trans-complementation in the mutants, and they showed constitutive expression in the early growth stage, whose overexpression in BK3-25 led to a 7.20-69.75% titer increase in salinomycin. Furthermore, the heterologous expression of <i>SLNHY_0929</i> or <i>SLNHY_1893</i> rendered the host <i>Streptomyces lividans</i> with improved resistance to salinomycin. Interestingly, <i>SLNHY_0929</i> was found to be a polyether-specific transporter because the titers of monensin, lasalocid, and nigericin were also increased by 124.6%, 60.4%, and 77.5%, respectively, through its overexpression in the corresponding producing strains. In conclusion, a transcriptome-based strategy was developed to mine genes involved in salinomycin export, which may pave the way for further salinomycin titer improvement and the identification of transporter genes involved in the biosynthesis of other antibiotics.",

Using tandem mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and synthetic diastereomers, we identified the N-terminal amino group of the agmatinamic acid as the N-acetylation site. These findings highlight the pharmacophore region of paenilamicin, which we very recently identified as a ribosome inhibitor. Here, we further determined the crystal structure of PamZ:acetyl-CoA complex at 1.34âÃ resolution. An unusual tandem-domain architecture provides a well-defined substrate-binding groove decorated with negatively-charged residues to specifically attract the cationic paenilamicin.

The DNA-binding WRKY transcription factors have a key regulatory role in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in plants. However, little is currently known about their involvement in camptothecin biosynthesis in <i>O. pumila</i>. We identified 46 <i>OpWRKY</i> genes unevenly distributed on the 11 chromosomes of <i>O. pumila</i>. Phylogenetic and multiple sequence alignment analyses divided the OpWRKY proteins into three subfamilies. Based on spatial expression and co-expression, we targeted the candidate gene <i>OpWRKY6</i>. Overexpression of <i>OpWRKY6</i> significantly reduced the accumulation of camptothecin compared with the control. Conversely, camptothecin accumulation increased in <i>OpWRKY6</i> knockout lines. Further biochemical assays showed that <i>OpWRKY6</i> negatively regulates camptothecin biosynthesis from both the iridoid and shikimate pathways by directly downregulating the gene expression of <i>OpGES</i>, <i>Op10HGO</i>, <i>Op7DLH</i>, and <i>OpTDC</i>. Our data provide direct evidence for the involvement of WRKYs in the regulation of camptothecin biosynthesis and offer valuable information for enriching the production of camptothecin in plant systems.",

The sessile cells in the biofilm exhibited improved gastrointestinal and thermal tolerance compared to the planktonic cells. Additionally, the RT-qPCR assay indicated that the <i>luxS</i> gene played a crucial role in biofilm formation, with its relative expression level being 8.7-fold higher compared to the planktonic cells.

These strategies, however, often entail laborious, multi-step, and time-consuming procedures to recover the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from soil metagenomes for subsequent heterologous expression. Here, we developed an efficient method we called single Nanopore read cluster mining (SNRCM), which enables the fast recovery of complete BGCs from a soil metagenome using long- and short-read sequencing. A metagenomic fosmid library of 83,700 clones was generated and sequenced using Nanopore as well as Illumina technologies. Hybrid assembled contigs of the sequenced fosmid library were subsequently analyzed to identify BGCs encoding secondary metabolites. Using SNRCM, we aligned the identified BGCs directly to Nanopore long-reads and were able to detect complete BGCs on single fosmids. This enabled us to select for and recover BGCs of interest for subsequent heterologous expression attempts. Additionally, the sequencing data of the fosmid library and its corresponding metagenomic DNA enabled us to assemble and recover a large nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) BGC from three different fosmids of our library and to directly amplify and recover a complete lasso peptide BGC from the high-quality metagenomic DNA. Overall, the strategies presented here provide a useful tool for accelerating and facilitating the identification and production of potentially interesting bioactive compounds from soil metagenomes. KEY POINTS: â¢ An efficient approach for the recovery of BGCs from soil metagenomes was developed to facilitate natural product discovery. â¢ A fosmid library was constructed from soil metagenomic HMW DNA and sequenced via Illumina and Nanopore. â¢ Nanopore long-reads enabled the direct identification and recovery of complete BGCs on single fosmids.",

L-lysine, an essential amino acid, is produced biologically in quantities exceeding two million tons per year; yet, L-lysine production is challenged by efficient export system at high titers during fermentation. To address this issue, new exporter candidates for efficient efflux of L-lysine are needed. Using metagenomic functional selection, we identified 58 genes encoded on 28 unique metagenomic fragments from cow gut microbiome library that improved L-lysine tolerance. These genes include a novel L-lysine transporter, belonging to a previously uncharacterized EamA superfamily, which is further <i>in vivo</i> characterized as L-lysine exporter using <i>Xenopus oocyte</i> expression system as well as <i>Escherichia coli</i> host. This novel exporter improved L-lysine tolerance in <i>E. coli</i> by 40% and enhanced yield, titer, and the specific production of L-lysine in an industrial <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> strain by 7.8%, 9.5%, and 12%, respectively.

Herein, complete in vitro reconstitution of the oxazinomycin biosynthetic pathway is described. Construction of the <i>C</i>-glycosidic bond between ribose 5-phosphate and an oxygen-labile pyridine heterocycle is catalyzed by the <i>C</i>-glycosidase OzmB and involves formation of an enzyme-substrate Schiff base intermediate. The DUF4243 family protein OzmD is shown to catalyze oxygen insertion and rearrangement of the pyridine <i>C</i>-nucleoside intermediate to generate the 1,3-oxazine moiety along with the elimination of cyanide. Spectroscopic analysis and mutagenesis studies indicate that OzmD is a novel nonheme iron-dependent enzyme in which the catalytic iron center is likely coordinated by four histidine residues.

Information on their species diversity in clinical specimens, aetiology and appropriate therapeutic treatment is scarce. We identified and evaluated the antibiotic susceptibility profile of 84 Streptomyces clinical isolates from the Czech Republic. In the absence of appropriate disk diffusion (DD) breakpoints for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) of Streptomyces spp., we determined DD breakpoints by correlation with the broth microdilution method and by the distribution of zone diameters among isolates. Correlation accuracy was high for 9 antibiotics, leading to the establishment of the most valid DD breakpoints for Streptomyces antibiotic susceptibility evaluationÂ so far. Clinical strains belonged to 17 different phylotypes dominated by a cluster of strains sharing the same percentage of 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with more than one species (S. albidoflavus group, S. hydrogenans, S. resistomycificus, S. griseochromogenes; 70% of isolates). AST results showed that Streptomyces exhibited intrinsic resistance to penicillin, general susceptibility to amikacin, gentamycin, vancomycin and linezolid, and high percentage of susceptibility to tetracyclines and clarithromycin. For the remaining antibiotics, AST showed inter- and intra-species variations when compared to available literature (erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), indicating a region-dependent rather than species-specific patterns.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The bacterial response to antibiotics eliciting resistance is one of the key challenges in global health. Despite many attempts to understand intrinsic antibiotic resistance, many of the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. In this study, we found that iron supplementation promoted antibiotic resistance in Streptomyces coelicolor. Iron-promoted resistance occurred specifically against bactericidal antibiotics, irrespective of the primary target of antibiotics. Transcriptome profiling revealed that some genes in the central metabolism and respiration were upregulated under iron-replete conditions. Iron supported the growth of S. coelicolor even under anaerobic conditions. In the presence of potassium cyanide, which reduces aerobic respiration of cells, iron still promoted respiration and antibiotic resistance. This suggests the involvement of a KCN-insensitive type of respiration in the iron effect. This phenomenon was also observed in another actinobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis. Taken together, these findings provide insight into a bacterial resistance strategy that mitigates the activity of bactericidal antibiotics whose efficacy accompanies oxidative damage by switching the respiration mode. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A widely investigated mode of antibiotic resistance occurs via mutations and/or by horizontal acquisition of resistance genes. In addition to this acquired resistance, most bacteria exhibit intrinsic resistance as an inducible and adaptive response to different classes of antibiotics. Increasing attention has been paid recently to intrinsic resistance mechanisms because this may provide novel therapeutic targets that help rejuvenate the efficacy of the current antibiotic regimen. In this study, we demonstrate that iron promotes the intrinsic resistance of aerobic actinomycetes Streptomyces coelicolor and Mycobacterium smegmatis against bactericidal antibiotics. A surprising role of iron to increase respiration, especially in a mode of using less oxygen, appears a fitting strategy to cope with bactericidal antibiotics known to kill bacteria through oxidative damage. This provides new insights into developing antimicrobial treatments based on the availability of iron and oxygen.",

High-carbon sugar nucleoside antimicrobials are an underexplored class of natural products with unique structures and important biological activities. Recent studies on C6 sugar nucleoside antifungal natural products, such as nikkomycins and polyoxins, revealed a novel biosynthetic mechanism involving cryptic phosphorylation. However, the generality of this biosynthetic mechanism remained unexplored. We here report in vitro characterization of the biosynthesis of a C7 sugar nucleoside antifungal, malayamycin A. Our results demonstrate that the malayamycin biosynthetic enzymes specifically accept 2'-phosphorylated biosynthetic intermediates, suggesting that cryptic phosphorylation-mediated biosynthesis is conserved beyond C6 sugar nucleosides. Furthermore, the results suggest a generalizable divergent biosynthetic mechanism for high-carbon sugar nucleoside antifungals. In this model, C6 and C7 sugar nucleoside biosyntheses proceed via a common C8 sugar nucleoside precursor, and the sugar size is determined using the functions of Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±-KG)-dependent dioxygenases (NikI/PolD for C6 sugar nucleosides and MalI for C7 sugar nucleosides). These results provide an important guidance for the future genome-mining discovery of high-carbon sugar nucleoside antimicrobials.",

Currently, the ergosterol-targeting Amphotericin B (AmB) and the DNA/RNA-synthesis inhibitor 5-flucytosine (5-FC) are the two main drugs available for first-line defense against life-threatening <i>Candida auris</i> infections. However, important aspects of their mechanisms of action require further clarification, especially regarding metabolic reactions of yeast cells. Here, we applied Raman spectroscopy empowered with specifically tailored machine-learning algorithms to monitor and to image <i>in situ</i> the susceptibility of two <i>Candida auris</i> clades to different antifungal drugs (LSEM 0643 or JCM15448T, belonging to the East Asian Clade II; and, LSEM 3673 belonging to the South African Clade III). Raman characterizations provided new details on the mechanisms of action against <i>Candida auris</i> Clades II and III, while also unfolding differences in their metabolic reactions to different drugs. AmB treatment induced biofilm formation in both clades, but the formed biofilms showed different structures: a dense and continuous biofilm structure in Clade II, and an extra-cellular matrix with a \"fluffy\" and discontinuous structure in Clade III. Treatment with 5-FC caused no biofilm formation but yeast-to-hyphal or pseudo-hyphal morphogenesis in both clades. Clade III showed a superior capacity in reducing membrane permeability to the drug through chemically tailoring chitin structure with a high degree of acetylation and fatty acids networks with significantly elongated chains. This study shows the suitability of the <i>in situ</i> Raman method in characterizing susceptibility and stress response of different <i>C. auris</i> clades to antifungal drugs, thus opening a path to identifying novel clinical solutions counteracting the spread of these alarming pathogens.",

Synthetic biology is founded on a solid and well-established theoretical framework that provides tools for conceptualizing, designing, and constructing synthetic biological systems. Recent developments in synthetic biology provide tools for engineering synthetic control systems in microbial cells. Applying protein engineering, DNA synthesis, and <i>in silico</i> design allows building metabolic pathways and biological circuits to control cellular behavior.

Here, we show that aminoglycosides, a well-known class of antibiotics produced by <i>Streptomyces</i>, are potent inhibitors of phage infection in widely divergent bacterial hosts. We demonstrate that aminoglycosides block an early step of the viral life cycle, prior to genome replication. Phage inhibition was also achieved using supernatants from natural aminoglycoside producers, indicating a broad physiological significance of the antiviral properties of aminoglycosides. Strikingly, we show that acetylation of the aminoglycoside antibiotic apramycin abolishes its antibacterial effect but retains its antiviral properties. Altogether, our study expands the knowledge of aminoglycoside functions, suggesting that aminoglycosides not only are used by their producers as toxic molecules against their bacterial competitors but also could provide protection against the threat of phage predation at the community level. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Predation by phages is a major driver of bacterial evolution. As a result, elucidating antiphage strategies is crucial from both fundamental and therapeutic standpoints. While protein-mediated defense mechanisms, like restriction-modification systems or CRISPR/Cas, have been extensively studied, much less is known about the potential antiphage activity of small molecules. Focusing on the model bacteria Escherichia coli and Streptomyces venezuelae, our findings revealed significant antiphage properties of aminoglycosides, a major class of translation-targeting antibiotics produced by <i>Streptomyces</i>. Further, we demonstrate that supernatants from natural aminoglycoside producers protect bacteria from phage propagation, highlighting the physiological relevance of this inhibition. Suppression of phage infection by aminoglycosides did not result from the indirect inhibition of bacterial translation, suggesting a direct interaction between aminoglycosides and phage components. This work highlights the molecular versatility of aminoglycosides, which have evolved to efficiently block protein synthesis in bacterial competitors and provide protection against phages.",

However, several of these metabolites also possess nonantimicrobial functions, both influencing the physiology of the producer and their ecological neighbors. An example of a versatile bacterial secondary metabolite with multiple functions is the tropone derivative tropodithietic acid (TDA). TDA is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound produced by several members of the Rhodobacteraceae family, a major marine bacterial lineage, within the genera Phaeobacter, Tritonibacter, and Pseudovibrio. The production of TDA is governed by the mode of growth and influenced by the availability of nutrient sources. The antibacterial effect of TDA is caused by disruption of the proton motive force of target microorganisms and, potentially, by its iron-chelating properties. TDA also acts as a signaling molecule, affecting gene expression in other bacteria, and altering phenotypic traits such as motility, biofilm formation, and antibiotic production in the producer. In microbial communities, TDA-producing bacteria cause a reduction of the relative abundance of closely related species and some fast-growing heterotrophic bacteria. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the chemical ecology of TDA, including the environmental niches of TDA-producing bacteria, and the molecular mechanisms governing the function and regulation of TDA.",

Among these, 6 tryptophan variants are previously identified, 15 are newly annotated, and 4 are still unknown, most of which are involved in the cascade of oxidation in the blood microparticle. Remarkably, Trp313 of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was up-oxidized whereas Trp16 and Trp38 of hemoglobin (HBB) were down-oxidized in NCSLC tissues. The results were further supported by an independent cohort of 103 lung adenocarcinoma samples, reflecting a negative feedback and potential detoxification mechanism against tumor glycolysis and hypoxia. Overall, the study reports a quick approach to explore tryptophan variants at the proteomic scale. Our findings highlight the predominant role of tryptophan oxidation in regulating the redox balance of cancer cells and its potential role as prognostic biomarker for patients with NSCLC.",

Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus (XP) living in mutualistic symbiosis with entomopathogenic nematodes generate natural products to mediate bacteria-nematode-insect interactions. However, a lack of systematic analysis of the XP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) has limited the understanding of how natural products affect interactions between the organisms. Here we combine pangenome and sequence similarity networks to analyse BGCs from 45 XP strains that cover all sequenced strains in our collection and represent almost all XP taxonomy. The identified 1,000 BGCs belong to 176 families. The most conserved families are denoted by 11 BGC classes. We homologously (over)express the ubiquitous and unique BGCs and identify compounds featuring unusual architectures. The bioactivity evaluation demonstrates that the prevalent compounds are eukaryotic proteasome inhibitors, virulence factors against insects, metallophores and insect immunosuppressants. These findings explain the functional basis of bacterial natural products in this tripartite relationship.",

One of the primary reasons is insufficient expression of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) under standard laboratory conditions. Several methods have been developed to increase production from such \"cryptic\" BGCs. Among these, we recently implemented mass spectrometry-guided transposon mutagenesis, a forward genetic screen in which mutants that exhibit stimulated biosynthesis of cryptic metabolites, as read out by mass spectrometry, are selected from a transposon mutant library. Herein, we use Burkholderia gladioli as an example and provide guidelines for generating transposon mutant libraries, measuring metabolomic inventories through mass spectrometry, performing comparative metabolomics to prioritize cryptic natural products from the mutant library, and isolating and characterizing novel natural products elicited through mutagenesis. Application of this approach will be useful in both accessing novel natural products from cryptic BGCs and identifying genes involved in their global regulation.",

The current species within the relatively young Pliocene genus Pezicula are predominantly saprotrophic, while P. neosporulosa lacks such features. To understand the genomic background of this putatively convergent evolution, we performed population analyses of 77âP. neosporulosa isolates. This revealed a mosaic structure of a dozen non-recombining and highly genetically polymorphic subpopulations with a unique mating system structure. We found that one idiomorph of a probably duplicated mat1-2 gene was found in putatively heterothallic isolates, while the other co-occurred with mat1-1 locus suggesting homothallic reproduction for these strains. Moreover, 24 and 81 genes implicated in plant cell-wall degradation and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, respectively, showed signatures of the balancing selection. These findings highlight the evolutionary pattern of the two gene families for allowing the fungus a rapid adaptation towards endophytism and facilitating diverse symbiotic interactions.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Unique DNA repair enzymes that provide self-resistance against therapeutically important, genotoxic natural products have been discovered in bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Among these, the DNA glycosylase AlkZ is essential for azinomycin B production and belongs to the HTH_42 superfamily of uncharacterized proteins. Despite their widespread existence in antibiotic producers and pathogens, the roles of these proteins in production of other natural products are unknown. Here, we determine the evolutionary relationship and genomic distribution of all HTH_42 proteins from <i>Streptomyces</i> and use a resistance-based genome mining approach to identify homologs associated with known and uncharacterized BGCs. We find that AlkZ-like (AZL) proteins constitute one distinct HTH_42 subfamily and are highly enriched in BGCs and variable in sequence, suggesting each has evolved to protect against a specific secondary metabolite. As a validation of the approach, we show that the AZL protein, HedH4, associated with biosynthesis of the alkylating agent hedamycin, excises hedamycin-DNA adducts with exquisite specificity and provides resistance to the natural product in cells. We also identify a second, phylogenetically and functionally distinct subfamily whose proteins are never associated with BGCs, are highly conserved with respect to sequence and genomic neighborhood, and repair DNA lesions not associated with a particular natural product. This work delineates two related families of DNA repair enzymes-one specific for complex alkyl-DNA lesions and involved in self-resistance to antimicrobials and the other likely involved in protection against an array of genotoxins-and provides a framework for targeted discovery of new genotoxic compounds with therapeutic potential. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacteria are rich sources of secondary metabolites that include DNA-damaging genotoxins with antitumor/antibiotic properties. Although <i>Streptomyces</i> produce a diverse number of therapeutic genotoxins, efforts toward targeted discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) producing DNA-damaging agents is lacking. Moreover, work on toxin-resistance genes has lagged behind our understanding of those involved in natural product synthesis. Here, we identified over 70 uncharacterized BGCs producing potentially novel genotoxins through resistance-based genome mining using the azinomycin B-resistance DNA glycosylase AlkZ. We validate our analysis by characterizing the enzymatic activity and cellular resistance of one AlkZ ortholog in the BGC of hedamycin, a potent DNA alkylating agent. Moreover, we uncover a second, phylogenetically distinct family of proteins related to Escherichia coli YcaQ, a DNA glycosylase capable of unhooking interstrand DNA cross-links, which differs from the AlkZ-like family in sequence, genomic location, proximity to BGCs, and substrate specificity. This work defines two families of DNA glycosylase for specialized repair of complex genotoxic natural products and generalized repair of a broad range of alkyl-DNA adducts and provides a framework for targeted discovery of new compounds with therapeutic potential.",

In recent years, it has become evident that bacteria harbor a large, hidden reservoir of potential natural products in the form of silent or cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). These can be readily identified in microbial genome sequences but do not give rise to detectable levels of a natural product. Herein, we provide a useful organizational framework for the various methods that have been implemented for interrogating silent BGCs. We divide all available approaches into four categories. The first three are endogenous strategies that utilize the native host in conjunction with classical genetics, chemical genetics, or different culture modalities. The last category comprises expression of the entire BGC in a heterologous host. For each category, we describe the rationale, recent applications, and associated advantages and limitations.",

YerP had homology with the resistance, nodulation, and cell division (RND) family proton motive force-dependent efflux pumps only characterized in gram-negative strains. The yerP-deficient strain 802, in which the internal region of the yerP gene of B. subtilis strain 168 was deleted, showed susceptibility to acriflavine and ethidium bromide. When strain 802 was converted to a surfactin producer by introducing a functional sfp which encodes a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase and is mutated in B. subtilis strain 168, this yerP-deficient strain produced surfactin, although surfactin production was significantly reduced. The expression of yerP was at its maximum at the end of the logarithmic growth phase and was not induced by surfactin. yerP is the first RND-like gene characterized in gram-positive strains and is supposed to be involved in the efflux of surfactin.",

Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences showed that AviABC1 is similar to a large family of ATP-binding transporter proteins and that AviABC2 resembles hydrophobic transmembrane proteins known to act jointly with the ATP-binding proteins. The deduced amino acid sequence of aviRb showed similarity to those of other rRNA methyltransferases, and AviRa did not resemble any protein in the databases. Independent expression in S. lividans TK66 of aviABC1 plus aviABC2, aviRa, or aviRb conferred different levels of resistance to avilamycin: 5, 10, or 250 microg/ml, respectively. When either aviRa plus aviRb or aviRa plus aviRb plus aviABC1 plus aviABC2 was coexpressed in S. lividans TK66, avilamycin resistance levels reached more than 250 microg/ml. Avilamycin A inhibited poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis in an in vitro system using ribosomes of S. lividans TK66(pUWL201) (GWO), S. lividans TK66(pUWL201-Ra) (GWRa), or S. lividans TK66(pUWL201-Rb) (GWRb), whereas ribosomes of S. lividans TK66 containing pUWL201-Ra+Rb (GWRaRb) were highly resistant. aviRa and aviRb were expressed in Escherichia coli, and both enzymes were purified as fusion proteins to near homogeneity. Both enzymes showed rRNA methyltransferase activity using a mixture of 16S and 23S rRNAs from E. coli as the substrate. Coincubation experiments revealed that the enzymes methylate different positions of rRNA.",

Numbers of toxigenic bacteria increase during antibiotic use, and the resulting accumulation of tilimycin in the intestinal lumen damages the epithelium via genetic instability and apoptosis. Here we examine the impact of this genotoxin on the gut ecosystem. 16S rRNA sequencing of faecal samples from mice colonized with Klebsiella oxytoca strains and mechanistic analyses show that tilimycin is a pro-mutagenic antibiotic affecting multiple phyla. Transient synthesis of tilimycin in the murine gut antagonized niche competitors, reduced microbial richness and altered taxonomic composition of the microbiota both during and following exposure. Moreover, tilimycin secretion increased rates of mutagenesis in co-resident opportunistic pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, as shown by de novo acquisition of antibiotic resistance. We conclude that tilimycin is a bacterial mutagen, and flares of genotoxic Klebsiella have the potential to drive the emergence of resistance, destabilize the gut microbiota and shape its evolutionary trajectory.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The increase in antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to global health. Actinomycetes, the Gram-positive bacteria of the order <i>Actinomycetales</i>, are fertile producers of bioactive secondary metabolites, including antibiotics. Nearly two-thirds of antibiotics that are used for the treatment of bacterial infections were originally isolated from actinomycetes strains belonging to the genus <i>Streptomyces</i>. This emphasizes the importance of actinomycetes in antibiotic discovery. However, the identification of a new antimicrobial compound and the exploration of its mode of action are very challenging tasks. Therefore, different approaches that enable the \"detection\" of an antibiotic and the characterization of the mechanisms leading to the biological activity are indispensable. Beyond bioinformatics tools facilitating the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), whole cell-screenings-in which cells are exposed to actinomycete-derived compounds-are a common strategy applied at the very early stage in antibiotic drug development. More recently, target-based approaches have been established. In this case, the drug candidates were tested for interactions with usually validated targets. This review focuses on the bioactivity-based screening methods and provides the readers with an overview on the most relevant assays for the identification of antibiotic activity and investigation of mechanisms of action. Moreover, the article includes examples of the successful application of these methods and suggestions for improvement.",

Meanwhile, 30 patients without pulmonary infection after chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies were selected as a reference group. Patients in the infection group were subdivided into control and treatment groups (n=32 each) according to the different therapeutic regimens. The control group was given routine treatment with norvancomycin, while the treatment group was given teicoplanin combined with norvancomycin. The therapeutic effects, bacterial clearance rate, recovery time, clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS), inflammatory factors and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. The risk factors of pulmonary infection after treatment for hematologic malignancies were analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>The treatment group exhibited higher total therapeutic effect and higher bacterial clearance rate than the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The treatment group had shorter time to the recovery of white blood cell (WBC) count, time to the disappearance of cough and sputum, time to return to normal body temperature, and length of stay than the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). One month post-treatment, the levels of C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-1Î², and procalcitonin in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The CPISs at 7, 14, and 30 days after treatment were lower in the treatment group than those in the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Compared with the reference group, the infection group had higher rate of diabetes, higher rate of glucocorticoid use, longer time of agranulocytosis, longer hospital stay and lower WBC count (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that agranulocytosis time, diabetes mellitus and glucocorticoid use were independent risk factors for pulmonary infection after treatment for hematologic malignancies (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and that higher WBC was a protective factor (<i>P</i> < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Teicoplanin in the treatment of pulmonary infection after chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies can improve the therapeutic effects, effectively clear bacteria, shorten the recovery time and reduce the inflammatory response.",

Finding novel and potential antibiotics seems one of the probable solutions. In this work, a novel Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 was isolated and found to be an excellent source of antimicrobials as confirmed by agar-plug assay. It showed antibacterial activity against infection-causing bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 inhibited the growth methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), tetracycline-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and ampicillin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, to get deep insights about the genome and biosynthetic gene clusters producing antibiotics, whole genome sequencing was done. The strain EMB24 is closely related to the Streptomyces longispororuber as revealed by phylogenetic analysis which is a potential source of antibiotics and pigments as undecylprodigiosin and metacycloprodigiosin belonging to the class prodigiosin. Naphthyridinomycin, alkylresorcinols, desferrioxamine B and E, venezuelin, aborycin, MS-271, and siamycin are potent therapeutics that shared 100% similarity with the reference strain as revealed by the online antiSMASH tool.",

MRSA has acquired resistance to almost all Î²-lactam antibiotics, including the new-generation cephalosporins, and is often also resistant to multiple other antibiotic classes. The expression of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) is the primary basis for Î²-lactams resistance by MRSA, but it is coupled with other resistance mechanisms, conferring resistance to non-Î²-lactam antibiotics. The multiplicity of resistance mechanisms includes target modification, enzymatic drug inactivation, and decreased antibiotic uptake or efflux. This review highlights the molecular basis of resistance to non-Î²-lactam antibiotics recommended to treat MRSA infections such as macrolides, lincosamides, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, lipopeptides, and others. A thorough understanding of the molecular and biochemical basis of antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates could help in developing promising therapies and molecular detection methods of antibiotic resistance.",

Precise perception and rapid response to stress stimuli confer a fitness edge to the plant against its competitors, guaranteeing greater chances of survival and productivity. Plants can \"eavesdrop\" on volatile chemical cues from their stressed neighbours and have adapted to use these airborne signals to prepare for impending danger without having to experience the actual stress themselves. The role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in plant-plant communication has gained significant attention over the past decade, particularly with regard to the potential of VOCs to prime non-stressed plants for more robust defence responses to future stress challenges. The ecological relevance of such interactions under various environmental stresses has been much debated, and there is a nascent understanding of the mechanisms involved. This review discusses the significance of VOC-mediated inter-plant interactions under both biotic and abiotic stresses and highlights the potential to manipulate outcomes in agricultural systems for sustainable crop protection via enhanced defence. The need to integrate physiological, biochemical, and molecular approaches in understanding the underlying mechanisms and signalling pathways involved in volatile signalling is emphasised.",

Intriguingly, bioinformatic analyses of fungal genomes have revealed that fungi have the potential to produce significantly more natural products than what have been discovered so far. It has thus become widely accepted that most biosynthesis pathways of fungal natural products are silent or expressed at very low levels under laboratory cultivation conditions. To tap into this vast chemical reservoir, the reconstitution of entire biosynthetic pathways in genetically tractable fungal hosts (total heterologous biosynthesis) has become increasingly employed in recent years. This review summarizes total heterologous biosynthesis of fungal natural products accomplished before 2020 using <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> as heterologous hosts. We review here <i>Aspergillus</i> transformation, <i>A. nidulans</i> hosts, shuttle vectors for episomal expression, and chromosomal integration expression. These tools, collectively, not only facilitate the discovery of cryptic natural products but can also be used to generate high-yield strains with clean metabolite backgrounds. In comparison with total synthesis, total heterologous biosynthesis offers a simplified strategy to construct complex molecules and holds potential for commercial application.",

Therefore, the biosynthesis of these natural products has been extensively studied, especially the construction of their pharmacophores. Meanwhile, their producing strains have evolved corresponding self-resistance strategies to protect themselves. To further promote the functional characterization of their biosynthetic pathways and lay the foundation for the discovery and rational design of DNA alkylating agents, we summarize herein the progress of research into DNA-alkylating antitumor natural products, including their biosynthesis, modes of action, and auto-resistance mechanisms.",

We employ mutagenesis, high-resolution X-ray crystallography, and multi-scale molecular modelling methods to examine the binding and conformational behaviour of isomeric Î²-D-glucosides during substrate-product assisted processive catalysis that operates in GH3 hydrolases. Enzyme kinetics reveals that the W434H mutant retains broad specificity, while W434A behaves as a strict (1,3)-Î²-D-glucosidase. Investigations of reactant movements on the nanoscale reveal that processivity is sensitive to mutation-specific alterations of the tryptophan clamp. While wild-type and W434H utilise a lateral cavity for glucose displacement and sliding of (1,3)-linked hydrolytic products through the catalytic site without dissociation, consistent with their highÂ hydrolytic rates, W434A does not adopt processive catalysis. Phylogenomic analyses of GH3 hydrolases disclose the evolutionary advantage of the tryptophan clamp that confers broad specificity, high catalytic efficiency, and processivity.",

Without innovative weed management practices and new herbicidal modes of action, the unabated rise of herbicide resistance will undoubtedly place further stress upon food security. HMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase) is the rate limiting enzyme of the eukaryotic mevalonate pathway successfully targeted by statins to treat hypercholesterolemia in humans. As HMGR inhibitors have been shown to be herbicidal, HMGR could represent a mode of action target for the development of herbicides. Here, we present the crystal structure of a HMGR from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtHMG1) which exhibits a wider active site than previously determined structures from different species. This plant conserved feature enables the rational design of specific HMGR inhibitors and weÂ develop a tolerance trait through sequence analysis of fungal gene clusters.

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Moringa oleifera</i> (or the miracle tree) is a wild plant species widely grown for its seed pods and leaves, and is used in traditional herbal medicine. The metagenomic whole genome shotgun sequencing (mWGS) approach was used to characterize antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of the rhizobiomes of this wild plant and surrounding bulk soil microbiomes and to figure out the chance and consequences for highly abundant ARGs, e.g., <i>mtrA</i>, <i>golS</i>, <i>soxR</i>, <i>oleC</i>, <i>novA</i>, <i>kdpE</i>, <i>vanRO</i>, <i>parY</i>, and <i>rbpA</i>, to horizontally transfer to human gut pathogens <i>via</i> mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The results indicated that abundance of these ARGs, except for <i>golS</i>, was higher in rhizosphere of <i>M. oleifera</i> than that in bulk soil microbiome with no signs of emerging new soil ARGs in either soil type. The most highly abundant metabolic processes of the most abundant ARGs were previously detected in members of phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. These processes refer to three resistance mechanisms namely antibiotic efflux pump, antibiotic target alteration and antibiotic target protection. Antibiotic efflux mechanism included resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND), ATP-binding cassette (ABC), and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) antibiotics pumps as well as the two-component regulatory kdpDE system. Antibiotic target alteration included glycopeptide resistance gene cluster (vanRO), aminocoumarin resistance parY, and aminocoumarin self-resistance parY. While, antibiotic target protection mechanism included RbpA bacterial RNA polymerase (rpoB)-binding protein. The study supports the claim of the possible horizontal transfer of these ARGs to human gut and emergence of new multidrug resistant clinical isolates. Thus, careful agricultural practices are required especially for plants used in circles of human nutrition industry or in traditional medicine.",

CmnC and its homologues, VioC in viomycin (VIO) biosynthesis and OrfP in streptothricin (STT) biosynthesis, catalyze hydroxylation of l-Arg to form Î²-hydroxy l-Arg (CmnC and VioC) or Î²,Î³-dihydroxy l-Arg (OrfP). In this study, a combination of biochemical characterization and structural determination was performed to understand the substrate binding environment and substrate specificity of CmnC. Interestingly, despite having a high conservation of the substrate binding environment among CmnC, VioC, and OrfP, only OrfP can hydroxylate the substrate enantiomer d-Arg. Superposition of the structures of CmnC, VioC, and OrfP revealed a similar folds and overall structures. The active site residues of CmnC, VioC, and OrfP are almost conserved; however Leu136, Ser138, and Asp249 around the substrate binding pocket in CmnC are replaced by Gln, Gly, and Tyr in OrfP, respectively. These residues may play important roles for the substrate binding. The mutagenesis analysis revealed that the triple mutant CmnC<sup>L136Q,S138G,D249Y</sup> switches the substrate stereoselectivity from l-Arg to d-Arg with â¼6% relative activity. The crystal structure of CmnC<sup>L136Q,S138G,D249Y</sup> in complex with d-Arg revealed that the substrate loses partial interactions and adopts a different orientation in the binding site. This study provides insights into the enzyme engineering to Î±-KG non-heme iron oxygenases for adjustment to the substrate stereoselectivity and development of biocatalysts.",

        "pmc_abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The anthraquinone-fused 10-membered enediynes (AFEs), represented by tiancimycins (TNMs), possess a unique structural feature and promising potentials as payloads of antitumor antibody-drug conjugates. Despite many efforts, the insufficient yields remain a practical challenge for development of AFEs. Recent studies have suggested a unified basic biosynthetic route for AFEs, those core genes involved in the formation of essential common AFE intermediates, together with multiple regulatory genes, are highly conserved among the reported biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of AFEs. The extreme cytotoxicities of AFEs have compelled hosts to evolve strict regulations to control their productions, but the exact roles of related regulatory genes are still uncertain.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, the genetic validations of five putative regulatory genes present in the BGC of TNMs revealed that only three (tnmR1, tnmR3 and tnmR7) of them were involved in the regulation of TNMs biosynthesis. The bioinformatic analysis also revealed that they represented three major but distinct groups of regulatory genes conserved in all BGCs of AFEs. Further transcriptional analyses suggested that TnmR7 could promote the expressions of core enzymes TnmD/G and TnmN/O/P, while TnmR3 may act as a sensor kinase to work with TnmR1 and form a higher class unconventional orphan two-component regulatory system, which dynamically represses the expressions of TnmR7, core enzymes TnmD/G/J/K1/K2 and auxiliary proteins TnmT2/S2/T1/S1. Therefore, the biosynthesis of TNMs was stringently restricted by this cascade regulatory network at early stage to ensure the normal cell growth, and then partially released at the stationary phase for product accumulation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The pathway-specific cascade regulatory network consisting with TnmR3/R1 and TnmR7 was deciphered to orchestrate the production of TNMs. And it could be speculated as a common regulatory mechanism for productions of AFEs, which shall provide us new insights in future titer improvement of AFEs and potential dynamic regulatory applications in synthetic biology.",

Food-producing animals are considered reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and residual antibiotics that transfer from the farm through the table. The accumulation of residual antibiotics can lead to additional antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Therefore, this review evaluates the risk of carriage and spread of antibiotic resistance through food chain and the potential impact of antibiotic use in food-producing animals on food safety.

These so-called secondary metabolites naturally serve as antimicrobial \"weapon systems\", signaling molecules or developmental effectors for fungi and hence are produced only under very specific environmental conditions or stages in their life cycle. However, as these complex conditions are difficult or even impossible to mimic in laboratory settings, only a small fraction of the true chemical diversity of fungi is known so far. This also implies that a large space for potentially new pharmaceuticals remains unexplored. We here present an overview on current developments in advanced methods that can be used to explore this chemical space. We focus on genetic and genomic methods, how to detect genes that harbor the blueprints for the production of these compounds (i.e., biosynthetic gene clusters, BGCs), and ways to activate these silent chromosomal regions. We provide an in-depth view of the chromatin-level regulation of BGCs and of the potential to use the CRISPR/Cas technology as an activation tool.",

Scouting the genome for putative <i>N-</i>acyltransferase genes led to the identification of a candidate within a cryptic siderophore BGC (<i>csb</i>) encoding a putative homologue of the <i>N</i>6'-hydroxylysine acetyltransferase IucB. Expression of the codon-optimized gene designated <i>csbC</i> in Escherichia coli yielded the recombinant protein that was able to <i>N</i>-succinylate desertomycin A as well as several other structurally distinct antibiotics harboring amino groups. Some antibiotics were rendered antibiotically inactive due to the CsbC-catalyzed succinylation <i>in vitro</i>. Unlike many known <i>N</i>-acyltransferases involved in antibiotic resistance, CsbC could not efficiently acetylate the same antibiotics. When expressed in E. coli, CsbC provided low-level resistance to kanamycin and ampicillin, suggesting that it may play a role in antibiotic resistance in natural habitats, where the concentration of antibiotics is usually low. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> In their natural habitats, bacteria encounter a plethora of organic compounds, some of which may be represented by antibiotics produced by certain members of the microbial community. A number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms have been described, including those specified by distinct genes encoding proteins that degrade, modify, or expel antibiotics. In this study, we report identification and characterization of an enzyme apparently involved in the biosynthesis of a siderophore, but also having the ability of modify and thereby inactivate a wide variety of structurally diverse antibiotics. This discovery sheds light on additional capabilities of bacteria to withstand antibiotic treatment and suggests that enzymes involved in secondary metabolism may have an additional function in the natural environment.",

In this study, the genome of CCB-ST2H9 was sequenced, and the pan-genome of 37 <i>Photobacterium</i> strains was analysed. Phylogeny based on core genes showed that CCB-ST2H9 clustered with <i>P. galatheae</i>, forming a distinct clade with <i>P. halotolerans</i>, <i>P. salinisoli</i>, and <i>P. arenosum</i>. The core genome of <i>Photobacterium</i> was conserved in housekeeping functions, while the flexible genome was well represented by environmental genes related to energy production and carbohydrate metabolism. Genomic metrics including 16S rRNA sequence similarity, average nucleotide identity, and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values were below the cut-off for species delineation, implying that CCB-ST2H9 potentially represents a new species. Genome mining revealed that biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) involved in producing antimicrobial compounds such as holomycin in CCB-ST2H9 could contribute to the antagonistic potential. Furthermore, the EtOAc extract from the culture broth of CCB-ST2H9 exhibited antagonistic activity against <i>Vibrio</i> spp. Intriguingly, clustering based on BGCs profiles grouped <i>P. galatheae</i>, <i>P. halotolerans</i>, <i>P. salinisoli</i>, <i>P. arenosum</i>, and CCB-ST2H9 together in the heatmap by the presence of a large number of BGCs.

This study revealed the <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> biocontrol effects of VOCs released by <i>B. velezensis</i> L1 on <i>A. iridiaustralis</i>, a pathogenic fungus responsible for rot of wolfberry fruit. The inhibition rates of VOCs of <i>B. velezensis</i> L1 on the mycelial growth of <i>A. iridiaustrali</i>s <i>in vitro</i> were 92.86 and 90.30%, respectively, when the initial inoculum concentration on the plate was 1 Ã 10<sup>9</sup> colony forming unit (CFU)/ml.

        "pmc_abstract": "<i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 is an important food-borne and water-borne pathogen that causes hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans and may cause serious morbidity and large outbreaks worldwide. People with bloody diarrhea have an increased risk of developing serious complications such as acute renal failure and neurological damage. The hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a serious condition, and up to 50% of HUS patients can develop long-term renal dysfunction or blood pressure-related complications. Children aged two to six years have an increased risk of developing HUS. Clinical enteropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EPEC) infectionsÂ show fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. The EPEC reservoir is unknown but is suggested to be an asymptomatic or symptomatic child or an asymptomatic adult carrier. Spreading is often through the fecal-oral route. The prevalence of EPEC in infants is low, and EPEC is highly contagious in children. EPEC disease in children tends to be clinically more severe than other diarrheal infections. Some children experience persistent diarrhea that lasts for more than 14 days. Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) strains are a compelling cause of the problem of diarrheal disease. ETEC strains are a global concern as the bacteria are the leading cause of acute watery diarrhea in children and the leading cause of traveler's diarrhea. It is contagious to children and can cause chronic diarrhea that can affect the development and well-being of children. Infections with diarrheagenic <i>E. coli</i> are more common in African countries. Antimicrobial agents should be avoided in the acute phase of the disease since studies showed that antimicrobial agents may increase the risk of HUS in children. The South African National Veterinary Surveillance and Monitoring Programme for Resistance to Antimicrobial Drugs has reported increased antimicrobial resistance in <i>E. coli</i>. Pathogenic bacterial strains have developed resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents due to antimicrobial misuse. The induced heavy metal tolerance may also enhance antimicrobial resistance. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance depends on the type of the antimicrobial agent, bacterial strain, dose, time, and mode of administration. Developing countries are severely affected by increased resistance to antimicrobial agents due to poverty, lack of proper hygiene, and clean water, which can lead to bacterial infections with limited treatment options due to resistance.",

Likewise, we discuss integration of principles of comparative evolutionary studies and retrobiosynthetic predictions to better understand biosynthetic mechanistic details and link genome sequence to structure. Lastly, we discuss advances in engineering, chemistry, and molecular networking and other computational approaches that are accelerating progress in the field of omic-informed natural product drug discovery.

However, the effects of MLT on microbes have seldom been reported. In this study, we examined the influence of exogenous MLT on the growth and hypocrellin biosynthesis of bambusicolous fungus <i>Shiraia</i> sp. S9. Hypocrellin A (HA) is a photoactivated and photoinduced perylenequinone (PQ) toxin in <i>Shiraia</i>. Exogenous MLT at 100.00 Î¼M not only decreased fungal conidiation and spore germination but inhibited HA contents significantly in fungal cultures under a light/dark (24 h:24 h) shift. MLT treatment was associated with higher activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase) and a marked decline in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the mycelia. Moreover, MLT induced endogenous nitric oxide (NO) production during the culture. The NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) potentiated MLT-induced inhibition of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> production, but NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) enhanced O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> production, whereas MLT-induced NO level was increased by the ROS scavenger vitamin C (Vc). The changes in NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were proved to be involved in the MLT-induced downregulation of the expressions of HA biosynthetic genes, leading to the suppression of HA production. This study provides new insight into the regulatory roles of MLT on fungal secondary metabolism activities and a basis for understanding self-resistance in phototoxin-producing fungi.",

However, the low output and high cost of chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis have hampered the application and commercialization of chaetoglobosin A in agriculture and biomedicine. Here, the CgMfs1 gene, which encodes the major facilitator superfamily secondary transporter, was identified based on bioinformatics analysis, and an intensive study of its effects on chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis and secretion was performed using CgMfs1-silencing and CgMfs1-overexpression strategies. Inactivation of CgMfs1 caused a notable decrease in chaetoglobosin A yield from 58.66âmg/L to 19.95âmg/L (MFS1-3) and 17.13âmg/L (MFS1-4). The use of an efficient expression plasmid in Chaetomium globosum W7 to generate the overexpression mutant OEX13 resulted in the highest chaetoglobosin A increase to 298.77âmg/L. Interestingly, the transcription level of the polyketide synthase gene significantly fluctuated with the change in CgMfs1, confirming that the predicted efflux gene CgMfs1 could play a crucial role in chaetoglobosin A transportation. Effective efflux of chaetoglobosin A could possibly alleviate feedback inhibition, resulting in notable increase in the expression of the polyketide synthase gene. Furthermore, we utilized cornstalk as the fermentation substrate to produce chaetoglobosin A, and scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy revealed that the strain OEX13 could well degrade cornstalk, presenting significant increases in the chaetoglobosin A yield, when compared with that produced by the wild-type strain (from 40.32 to 191.90âmg/L). Thus, this research provides a novel analogous engineering strategy for the construction of high-yielding strain and offers new insight into large-scale chaetoglobosin A production.",

Bioinformatics, biochemical analyses, and X-ray crystallography revealed CtaZ as a founding member of a new group of GyrI-like proteins. CtaZ is unique in binding a polythioamide scaffold in a ligand-optimized hydrophobic pocket, thereby confining CTA. By genome mining using CtaZ as a handle, we discovered previously overlooked homologs encoded by diverse members of the phylum Firmicutes, including many pathogens.

Site-directed mutagenesis of AlmA revealed that the substitution of two amino acids residues around the substrate binding pocket transformed its substrate specificity from that of alaremycin precursor synthesis to ALA synthesis. To estimate the evolutionary trajectory of AlmA and ALAS, we performed an ancestral sequence reconstitution analysis based on a phylogenetic tree of AlmA and ALAS. The reconstructed common ancestral enzyme of AlmA and ALAS exhibited alaremycin precursor synthetic activity, rather than ALA synthetic activity. These results suggest that ALAS evolved from an AlmA-like enzyme.

The main objectives of soybean crop improvement are based on the identification of sources of resistance or tolerance against various biotic as well as abiotic stresses and utilization of these sources for further hybridization and transgenic processes for development of new cultivars for stress management. The focus of the present review is to summarize genetic aspects of various diseases caused by pathogens in soybean and molecular breeding research work conducted to date.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Pig manure is a reservoir of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The effect of biochar on the variations in physicochemical properties, bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of compost product during co-composting of pig manure and corn straw have been investigated in this study. Compared with the control treatment (CK), biochar addition accelerated the increase in pile temperature and prolonged the high temperature period (>55Â°C) for 2Â days. Under biochar influence, organic matter degradation, NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>-N conversion and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>-N production was accelerated, and dissolved total organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) utilization by microorganisms were enhanced. Biochar addition altered the microbial community and promoted the vital activity of <i>Actinobacteria</i> in the later composting stage. The antibiotics removal efficiency (except danofloxacin and enrofloxacin) was accelerated in the early composting stage (1-14Â days) by biochar addition, the pile temperature had a positive effect on antibiotics removal, and the total antibiotics removal efficiency in CK and CK+Biochar treatments was 69.58% and 78.67% at the end of the composting process, respectively. The absolute abundance of most of the ARGs in the CK+Biochar treatment was lower than that in the CK treatment during composting, and the ARGs removal mainly occurred in the early (1-14Â days) and later (28-50Â days) stages. Biochar addition reduced the absolute abundance of MGEs (<i>intI1</i>, <i>intI2</i>) in the compost product, and most of the ARGs had a significant positive correlation with MGEs. Network analysis and redundancy analysis showed that ARGs and MGEs occurred in various host bacteria (<i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and <i>Halanaerobiaeota</i>), and that DTN and NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>-N are the main factors regulating the changes in bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and MGEs during composting. Moreover, MGEs contributed the most to the variation in ARGs. In summary, biochar addition during composting accelerated antibiotics removal and inhibited accumulation and transmission of ARGs. The results of this study could provide theoretical and technical support for biochar application for antibiotics and ARGs removal during livestock and poultry manure composting.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The human microbiota produces molecules that are evolved to interact with the diverse cellular machinery of both the host and microbes, mediating health and diseases. One of the most puzzling microbiome molecules is colibactin, a genotoxin encoded in some commensal and extraintestinal microbes and is implicated in initiating colorectal cancer. The colibactin cluster was discovered more than 15Â years ago, and most of the research studies have been focused on revealing the biosynthesis and precise structure of the cryptic encoded molecule(s) and the mechanism of carcinogenesis. In 2022, the Balskus group revealed that colibactin not only hits targets in the eukaryotic cell machinery but also in the prokaryotic cell. To that end, colibactin crosslinks the DNA resulting in activation of the SOS signaling pathway, leading to prophage induction from bacterial lysogens and modulation of virulence genes in pathogenic species. These unique activities of colibactin highlight its ecological role in shaping gut microbial communities and further consequences that impact human health. This review dives in-depth into the molecular mechanisms underpinning colibactin cellular targets in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, aiming to understand the fine details of the role of secreted microbiome chemistry in mediating host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. This understanding translates into a better realization of microbiome potential and how this could be advanced to future microbiome-based therapeutics or diagnostic biomarkers.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a global health crisis. New classes of antibiotics that can treat drug-resistant infections are urgently needed. To communicate this message, researchers have used antibiotic development timelines, but these are often contradictory or imprecise. We conducted a systematic literature review to produce an antibiotic timeline that incorporates the dates of discovery, first use, and initial reports of the emergence of resistance for the 38 classes of clinically used antibiotics. From our timeline, we derive lessons for identifying new antibiotics that are less prone to resistance. These include a required focus on molecules that exhibit multiple modes of action, possess unusually long 'resistance windows', or those that engage cellular targets whose molecular architectures are at least in part decoupled from evolutionary pressures. Our analysis also further highlights the importance of safeguarding antibiotics as a mechanism for mitigating the development of resistance. We have made our data and sources freely available so that the research community can adapt them to their own needs.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Mitophagy is an important mechanism for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through elimination of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) injury. Î²-Caryophyllene (BCP) is a natural sesquiterpene compound found in the essential oil of plants and has been shown to ameliorate CIR injury. However, whether BCP protects neurons from CIR injury by activating mitophagy is still unclear, and the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, a mouse neuron HT-22 cell of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and C57BL/6 male mouse of transient middle artery occlusion followed by 24 h reperfusion (MCAO/R) were established the model of CIR injury. Our results show that BCP remarkably protected against cell death and apoptosis induced by OGD/R, and decreased neurologic injury, infarct volume, and the injury of neurons in CA1 region on MCAO/R mice. In addition, BCP accelerated mitophagy by regulating expression of mitochondrial autophagy marker molecules and the mt-Atp6/Rpl13 ratio (reflecting the relative number of mitochondria), and promoting autophagosome formation compared with OGD/R and MCAO/R groups both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, this study revealed that BCP pre-treatment could activate the Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway, also with mitophagy activation. To explore the mechanisms, mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1) was used to investigate the role of BCP in CIR injury. We found that Mdivi-1 not only decreased BCP-induced facilitation of mitophagy, but also significantly weakened BCP-induced protection against OGD/R and MCAO/R models, which was consistent with levels of Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that facilitating mitophagy via Pink1/Parkin2 signaling is essential for the neuroprotective effect of BCP against CIR injury.",

Clinically, at least 15% of patients with HCC had strong side effects of interventional therapy (IT) and have poor sensitivity to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), as a multi-target adjuvant therapy, had been shown to play an active anti-tumor role in many previous studies. This review systematically summarized the role of TCM combined with clinically commonly used drugs for the treatment of HCC (including mitomycin C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, sorafenib, etc.) in the past basic research, and summarized the efficacy of TCM combined with surgery, IT and conventional therapy (CT) in clinical research. It was found that TCM, as an adjuvant treatment, played many roles in the treatment of HCC, including enhancing the tumor inhibition, reducing toxic and side effects, improving chemosensitivity and prolonging survival time of patients. This review summarized the advantages of integrated traditional Chinese and modern medicine in the treatment of HCC and provides a theoretical basis for clinical research.",

Bacterial type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII) is a vital aspect of bacterial physiology, not only for the formation of membranes but also to produce intermediates used in vitamin production. Nature has evolved a repertoire of antibiotics inhibiting different aspects of FASII, validating these enzymes as potential targets for new antibiotic discovery and development. However, significant obstacles have been encountered in the development of FASII antibiotics, and few FASII drugs have advanced beyond the discovery stage. Most bacteria are capable of assimilating exogenous fatty acids. In some cases they can dispense with FASII if fatty acids are present in the environment, making the prospects for identifying broad-spectrum drugs against FASII targets unlikely. Single-target, pathogen-specific FASII drugs appear the best option, but a major drawback to this approach is the rapid acquisition of resistance via target missense mutations. This complication can be mitigated during drug development by optimizing the compound design to reduce the potential impact of on-target missense mutations at an early stage in antibiotic discovery. The lessons learned from the difficulties in FASII drug discovery that have come to light over the last decade suggest that a refocused approach to designing FASII inhibitors has the potential to add to our arsenal of weapons to combat resistance to existing antibiotics.",

We can increase our understanding by investigating the same strategies found in antibiotic-producing bacteria. In this work, we characterize the self-resistance protein Ecm16 encoded by echinomycin-producing bacteria. Ecm16 is a structural homolog of the nucleotide excision repair protein UvrA. Expression of ecm16 in the heterologous system Escherichia coli was sufficient to render resistance against echinomycin. Ecm16 binds DNA (double-stranded and single-stranded) using a nucleotide-independent binding mode. Ecm16's binding affinity for DNA increased by 1.7-fold when the DNA is intercalated with echinomycin. Ecm16 can render resistance against echinomycin toxicity independently of the nucleotide excision repair system. Similar to UvrA, Ecm16 has ATPase activity, and this activity is essential for Ecm16's ability to render echinomycin resistance. Notably, UvrA and Ecm16 were unable to complement each other's function. Together, our findings identify new mechanistic details of how a refurbished DNA repair protein Ecm16 can specifically render resistance to the DNA intercalator echinomycin.",

However, PAC also contains several inhibitors that make its detoxification inevitable. In our study, we examined the transcriptional response of Aspergillus oryzae to cultivation on 20% detoxified PAC, pure acetate and glucose using RNA-seq analysis. Functional enrichment analysis of 3463 significantly differentially expressed (log2FC >2 & FDR < 0.05) genes revealed similar metabolic tendencies for both acetate and PAC, as upregulated genes in these cultures were mainly associated with ribosomes and RNA processing, whereas transmembrane transport was downregulated. Unsurprisingly, metabolic pathway analysis revealed that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and starch and sucrose metabolism were upregulated for glucose, whereas glyoxylate and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were important carbon utilization pathways for acetate and PAC, respectively. Moreover, genes involved in the biosynthesis of various amino acids such as arginine, serine, cysteine and tryptophan showed higher expression in the acetate-containing cultures. Direct comparison of the transcriptome profiles of acetate and PAC revealed that pyruvate metabolism was the only significantly different metabolic pathway and was overexpressed in the PAC cultures. Upregulated genes included those for methylglyoxal degradation and alcohol dehydrogenases, which thus represent potential targets for the further improvement of fungal PAC tolerance.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Convergence is the phenomenon whereby similar phenotypes evolve independently in different lineages. One example is resistance to toxins in animals. Toxins have evolved many times throughout the tree of life. They disrupt molecular and physiological pathways in target species, thereby incapacitating prey or deterring a predator. In response, molecular resistance has evolved in many species exposed to toxins to counteract their harmful effects. Here, we review current knowledge on the convergence of toxin resistance using examples from a wide range of toxin families. We explore the evolutionary processes and molecular adaptations driving toxin resistance. However, resistance adaptations may carry a fitness cost if they disrupt the normal physiology of the resistant animal. Therefore, there is a trade-off between maintaining a functional molecular target and reducing toxin susceptibility. There are relatively few solutions that satisfy this trade-off. As a result, we see a small set of molecular adaptations appearing repeatedly in diverse animal lineages, a phenomenon that is consistent with models of deterministic evolution. Convergence may also explain what has been called 'autoresistance'. This is often thought to have evolved for self-protection, but we argue instead that it may be a consequence of poisonous animals feeding on toxic prey. Toxin resistance provides a unique and compelling model system for studying the interplay between trophic interactions, selection pressures and the molecular mechanisms underlying evolutionary novelties.",

Natural products consisting of structural modifications of each of the canonical nucleosides have been discovered, ranging from simple modifications such as single-step alkylations or acylations to highly elaborate modifications that dramatically alter the nucleoside scaffold and require multiple enzyme-catalyzed reactions. A vast amount of genomic information has been uncovered the past two decades, which has subsequently allowed the first opportunity to interrogate the chemically intriguing enzymatic transformations for the latter type of modifications. This review highlights (i) the discovery and potential applications of structurally complex pyrimidine nucleoside antibiotics for which genetic information is known, (ii) the established reactions that convert the canonical pyrimidine into a new nucleoside scaffold, and (iii) the important tailoring reactions that impart further structural complexity to these molecules.",

This gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli to form inclusion bodies and in Streptomyces lividans, producing a soluble protein. S. lividans overexpressing oleY was used as a biotransformation host, and it converted the precursor L-olivosyl-erythronolide B into its 3-O-methylated derivative, L-oleandrosyl-erythronolide B. Two other monoglycosylated derivatives were also substrates for the OleY methyltransferase: L-rhamnosyl- and L-mycarosyl-erythronolide B. OleY methyltransferase was purified yielding a 43-kDa single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The native enzyme showed a molecular mass of 87 kDa by gel filtration chromatography, indicating that the enzyme acts as a dimer. It showed a narrow pH range for optimal activity, and its activity was clearly stimulated by the presence of several divalent cations, being maximal with Co(2+). The S. antibioticus OleG2 glycosyltransferase is proposed to transfer L-olivose to the oleandolide aglycon, which is then converted into L-oleandrose by the OleY methyltransferase. This represents an alternative route for L-oleandrose biosynthesis from that in the avermectin producer Streptomyces avermitilis, in which L-oleandrose is transferred to the aglycon by a glycosyltransferase.",

Purified ZmaR protein inactivated zwittermicin A, and biochemical assays for acetyltransferase activity with [14C]acetyl coenzyme A demonstrated that ZmaR catalyzes the acetylation of zwittermicin A with acetyl coenzyme A as a donor group, suggesting that ZmaR may constitute a new class of acetyltransferases.

It is semisynthesized from the sulfonated lipohexapeptide FR901379, a nonribosomal peptide produced by the filamentous fungus Coleophoma empetri. However, the low fermentation efficiency of FR901379 increases the cost of micafungin production and hinders its widespread clinical application.<h4>Results</h4>Here, a highly efficient FR901379-producing strain was constructed via systems metabolic engineering in C. empetri MEFC09. First, the biosynthesis pathway of FR901379 was optimized by overexpressing the rate-limiting enzymes cytochrome P450 McfF and McfH, which successfully eliminated the accumulation of unwanted byproducts and increased the production of FR901379. Then, the functions of putative self-resistance genes encoding Î²-1,3-glucan synthase were evaluated in vivo. The deletion of CEfks1 affected growth and resulted in more spherical cells. Additionally, the transcriptional activator McfJ for the regulation of FR901379 biosynthesis was identified and applied in metabolic engineering. Overexpressing mcfJ markedly increased the production of FR901379 from 0.3Â g/L to 1.3Â g/L. Finally, the engineered strain coexpressing mcfJ, mcfF, and mcfH was constructed for additive effects, and the FR901379 titer reached 4.0Â g/L under fed-batch conditions in a 5 L bioreactor.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study represents a significant improvement for the production of FR901379 and provides guidance for the establishment of efficient fungal cell factories for other echinocandins.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Physical activity represents a potent, non-pharmacological intervention delaying the onset of over 40 chronic metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and reducing all-cause mortality. Acute exercise improves glucose homeostasis, with regular participation in physical activity promoting long-term improvements in insulin sensitivity spanning healthy and disease population groups. At the skeletal muscle level, exercise promotes significant cellular reprogramming of metabolic pathways through the activation of mechano- and metabolic sensors, which coordinate downstream activation of transcription factors, augmenting target gene transcription associated with substrate metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. It is well established that frequency, intensity, duration, and modality of exercise play a critical role in the type and magnitude of adaptation; albeit, exercise is increasingly considered a vital lifestyle factor with a critical role in the entrainment of the biological clock. Recent research efforts revealed the time-of-day-dependent impact of exercise on metabolism, adaptation, performance, and subsequent health outcomes. The synchrony between external environmental and behavioural cues with internal molecular circadian clock activity is a crucial regulator of circadian homeostasis in physiology and metabolism, defining distinct metabolic and physiological responses to exercise unique to the time of day. Optimising exercise outcomes following when to exercise would be essential to establishing personalised exercise medicine depending on exercise objectives linked to disease states. We aim to provide an overview of the bimodal impact of exercise timing, i.e. the role of exercise as a time-giver (<i>zeitgeber</i>) to improve circadian clock alignment and the underpinning clock control of metabolism and the temporal impact of exercise timing on the metabolic and functional outcomes associated with exercise. We will propose research opportunities that may further our understanding of the metabolic rewiring induced by specific exercise timing.",

We focused on the PSM family of secreted amphipathic peptides in the pathogen <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> that uses two ABC transporters, PmtCD and AbcA, to export peptides across the bacterial cell membrane. We found that increased peptide hydrophobicity favors PSM secretion through PmtCD over AbcA and that only PmtCD protected cells against amphipathic peptides. We propose a two-system model in which PmtCD and AbcA independently export PSMs from either membrane or cytosolic environments, respectively. Our model provides a rationale for the encoding of multiple transport systems on diverse biosynthetic gene clusters used to produce distinct amphipathic molecules. In addition, our data serve as a guide for selectively blocking PSM secretion to achieve antimicrobial or antivirulence approaches and to disrupt established roles of PSM-mediated virulence.",

When investigating this process, researchers have mainly focused on describing advantageous phenotypes or putative advantageous genotypes. A recent increase in molecular data accessibility and technological advances has allowed researchers to go beyond description and to make inferences about the mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution. In this systematic review, we discuss articles from 2016 to 2022 that investigated or reviewed the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution in vertebrates in response to environmental variation. Regulatory elements within the genome and regulatory proteins involved in either gene expression or cellular pathways have been shown to play key roles in adaptive evolution in response to most of the discussed environmental factors. Gene losses were suggested to be associated with an adaptive response in some contexts. Future adaptive evolution research could benefit from more investigations focused on noncoding regions of the genome, gene regulation mechanisms, and gene losses potentially yielding advantageous phenotypes. Investigating how novel advantageous genotypes are conserved could also contribute to our knowledge of adaptive evolution.",

These ants may not encounter the specialist fungal pathogen <i>Escovopsis</i> known to threaten colonies of other fungus-growing ants. It is unknown whether <i>Actinobacteria</i> associated with these ants antagonize contaminant fungi and, if so, what the chemical basis of such antagonism is. We find that <i>Pseudonocardia</i> and <i>Amycolatopsis</i> strains isolated from three desert specialist <i>Trachymyrmex</i> species do antagonize diverse contaminant fungi isolated from field-collected ant colonies. We did not isolate the specialist fungal pathogen <i>Escovopsis</i> in our sampling. We trace strong antifungal activity from <i>Amycolatopsis</i> isolates to the molecule ECO-0501, an antibiotic that was previously under preclinical development as an antibacterial agent. In addition to suppression of contaminant fungi, we find that this molecule has strong activity against ant-associated <i>Actinobacteria</i> and may also play a role in bacterial competition in this niche. By studying interspecies interactions in a previously unexplored niche, we have uncovered novel bioactivity for a structurally unique antibiotic. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Animal hosts often benefit from chemical defenses provided by microbes. These molecular defenses are a potential source of novel antibiotics and offer opportunities for understanding how antibiotics are used in ecological contexts with defined interspecies interactions. Here, we recover contaminant fungi from nests of <i>Trachymyrmex</i> fungus-growing ants of the southwest desert of the United States and find that they are suppressed by <i>Actinobacteria</i> isolated from these ants.

The review will cover the choice of heterologous hosts, prioritization of BGCs for structural novelty, and how shunt products from heterologous expression can reveal important insights into the chemical logic of biosynthesis.

        "pmc_abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a universal phenomenon the origins of which lay in natural ecological interactions such as competition within niches, within and between micro- to higher-order organisms. To study these phenomena, it is crucial to examine the origins of AMR in pristine environments, i.e., limited anthropogenic influences. In this context, epilithic biofilms residing in glacier-fed streams (GFSs) are an excellent model system to study diverse, intra- and inter-domain, ecological crosstalk. We assessed the resistomes of epilithic biofilms from GFSs across the Southern Alps (New Zealand) and the Caucasus (Russia) and observed that both bacteria and eukaryotes encoded twenty-nine distinct AMR categories. Of these, beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and multidrug resistance were both abundant and taxonomically distributed in most of the bacterial and eukaryotic phyla. AMR-encoding phyla included Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria among the bacteria, alongside Ochrophyta (algae) among the eukaryotes. Additionally, biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) involved in the production of antibacterial compounds were identified across all phyla in the epilithic biofilms. Furthermore, we found that several bacterial genera (<i>Flavobacterium</i>, <i>Polaromonas,</i> Superphylum Patescibacteria) encode both atimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and BGCs within close proximity of each other, demonstrating their capacity to simultaneously influence and compete within the microbial community. Our findings help unravel how naturally occurring BGCs and AMR contribute to the epilithic biofilms mode of life in GFSs. Additionally, we report that eukaryotes may serve as AMR reservoirs owing to their potential for encoding ARGs. Importantly, these observations may be generalizable and potentially extended to other environments that may be more or less impacted by human activity. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Antimicrobial resistance is an omnipresent phenomenon in the anthropogenically influenced ecosystems. However, its role in shaping microbial community dynamics in pristine environments is relatively unknown. Using metagenomics, we report the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes and their associated pathways in epilithic biofilms within glacier-fed streams. Importantly, we observe biosynthetic gene clusters associated with antimicrobial resistance in both pro- and eukaryotes in these biofilms. Understanding the role of resistance in the context of this pristine environment and complex biodiversity may shed light on previously uncharacterized mechanisms of cross-domain interactions.",

This natural pseudo-oligosaccharide (PsOS) shows potent inhibitory activity toward various glycosyl hydrolases, including Î±-glucosidases and Î±-amylases. While acarbose and other PsOSs are produced by many different bacteria, their ecological or biological role in microbial communities is still an open question. Here, we show that several PsOS-producing actinobacteria, i.e., <i>Actinoplanes</i> sp. SE50/110 (acarbose producer), <i>Streptomyces glaucescens</i> GLA.O (acarbose producer), and <i>Streptomyces dimorphogenes</i> ATCC 31484 (trestatin producer), can grow in the presence of acarbose, while the growth of the non-PsOS-producing organism <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> M1152 was suppressed when starch is the main source of energy. Further investigations using recombinant Î±-amylases from <i>S. coelicolor</i> M1152 and the PsOS-producing actinobacteria revealed that the <i>S. coelicolor</i> Î±-amylase was inhibited by acarbose, whereas those from the PsOS-producing bacteria were not inhibited by acarbose. Bioinformatic and protein modeling studies suggested that a point mutation in the Î±-amylases of the PsOS-producing actinobacteria is responsible for the resistance of those enzymes toward acarbose. Converting the acarbose-resistant Î±-amylase AcbE to its A304H variant diminished its acarbose-resistance property. Taken together, the results suggest that acarbose is used by the producing bacteria as a competitive exclusion agent to suppress the growth of other microorganisms in their natural environment, while the producing organisms equip themselves with Î±-amylase variants that are resistant to acarbose.",

This bacteriocin is mainly active against Gram-positive bacteria. Leaderless bacteriocins do not undergo post-translational modifications and are therefore immediately active after their synthesis. As a result, the cells that produce such bacteriocins have developed means of protection against them which often involve transport systems. In this and our previous work, we constructed different mutants deleted in the genes involved in the transport functions, thus covering all the supposed components of this transport system, using <i>Listeria innocua</i> ATCC 33090 as the indicator strain to assess the activity of externalized EntDD14. We also assessed the self-resistance of the WT and all its engineered derivative mutants against EntDD14, provided extracellularly, in order to evaluate their self-resistance. The results obtained highlight that the ABC transporter constituted by the DdG, H, I, and J proteins contributes to EntDD14 export as well as resistance to an external supply of EntDD14. Our results also have established the essential role of the DdE and DdF proteins as primary transporters dedicated to the externalization of EntDD14. Moreover, the in silico data showed that DdE and DdF appear to assemble in a formation that forms an essential channel for the exit of EntDD14. This channel DdEF may interact with the ABC transporter DdGHIJ in order to control the flow of bacteriocin across the membrane, although the nature of this interaction remains to be elucidated.",

The biosynthesis of these metabolites is performed by networks of complex enzymes such as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, polyketide synthases, and terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes. The efficient production of these metabolites is dependent upon the supply of precursors that arise from primary metabolism. In the last decades, an impressive array of biosynthetic enzymes that provide specific precursors and intermediates leading to secondary metabolites biosynthesis has been reported. Suitable knowledge of the elaborated pathways that synthesize these precursors or intermediates is essential for advancing chemical biology and the production of natural or semisynthetic biological products. Two of the more prolific routes that provide key precursors in the biosynthesis of antitumor, immunosuppressant, antifungal, or antibacterial compounds are the lysine and ornithine pathways, which are involved in the biosynthesis of Î²-lactams and other non-ribosomal peptides, and bacterial and fungal siderophores. Detailed analysis of the molecular genetics and biochemistry of the enzyme system shows that they are formed by closely related components. Particularly the focus of this study is on molecular genetics and the enzymatic steps that lead to the formation of intermediates of the lysine pathway, such as Î±-aminoadipic acid, saccharopine, pipecolic acid, and related compounds, and of ornithine-derived molecules, such as N<sup>5</sup>-Acetyl-N<sup>5</sup>-Hydroxyornithine and N<sup>5</sup>-anhydromevalonyl-N<sup>5</sup>-hydroxyornithine, which are precursors of siderophores. We provide evidence that shows interesting functional relationships between the genes encoding the enzymes that synthesize these products.

Our findings indicate that plant-associated <i>Brevibacilli</i> are a rich source of putative antimicrobial compounds and might serve as a valuable starting point for the development of novel biocontrol agents.",

        "pmc_abstract": "The increase of planting density is a dominant approach for the higher yield of maize. However, the stalks of some varieties are prone to lodging under high density conditions. Much research has been done on the evaluation of maize lodging resistance. But there are few comprehensive reports on the determination of maize lodging resistance <i>in situ</i> without injury under field conditions. This study introduces a non-destructive <i>in situ</i> tester to determine the lodging resistance of the different maize varieties in the field. The force value can be obtained by pulling the stalk to different angles with this instrument, which is used to evaluate the lodging resistance of maize varieties. From 2018 to 2020, a total of 1,172 sample plants from 113 maize varieties were tested for the lodging resistance of plants. The statistical results show that the values of force on maize plants at 45Â° inclination angles (F<sub>45</sub>) are appropriate to characterize maize lodging resistance <i>in situ</i> by nondestructive testing in the field. According to the F<sub>45</sub> value, the maximum lodging resistance F<sub>max</sub> can be inferred. The formula is: F<sub>max</sub> =1.1354 F<sub>45</sub> - 0.3358. The evaluation results of lodging resistance of different varieties of this study are basically consistent with the test results of three-point bending method, moving wind tunnel and other methods. Therefore, the F<sub>45</sub> value is the optimal index for nondestructive evaluation of maize stalk-lodging resistance under the field-planting conditions.",

In this review, we summarize representative examples of self-resistance mechanisms for bioactive natural products functional at different cell locations to explore the models of resistance strategies involved.

This region is inhabited by specifically adapted microorganisms that produce various unique secondary metabolites (e.g. pigments) enabling their survival under the harsh environmental conditions. It was already shown that these natural, biologically active molecules may find application in various fields of biotechnology.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, a cold-active brown-pigment-producing Pseudomonas sp. ANT_H4 strain was characterized. In-depth genomic analysis combined with the application of a fosmid expression system revealed two different pathways of melanin-like compounds biosynthesis by the ANT_H4 strain. The chromatographic behavior and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic analyses allowed for the identification of the extracted melanin-like compound as a pyomelanin. Furthermore, optimization of the production and thorough functional analyses of the pyomelanin were performed to test its usability in biotechnology. It was confirmed that ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin increases the sun protection factor, enables scavenging of free radicals, and interacts with the iron from minerals. Moreover, it was shown for the first time that pyomelanin exhibits priming properties toward Calendula officinalis hairy roots in in vitro cultures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results of the study indicate the significant biotechnological potential of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin and open opportunities for future applications. Taking into account protective features of analyzed pyomelanin it may be potentially used in medical biotechnology and cosmetology. Especially interesting was showing that pyomelanin exhibits priming properties toward hairy roots, which creates a perspective for its usage for the development of novel and sustainable agrotechnical solutions.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are among the most clinically successful antimicrobials. GPAs inhibit cell-wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria via binding to lipid II. Natural GPAs are produced by various actinobacteria. Being themselves Gram-positives, the GPA producers evolved sophisticated mechanisms of self-resistance to avoid suicide during antibiotic production. These self-resistance genes are considered the primary source of GPA resistance genes actually spreading among pathogenic enterococci and staphylococci. The GPA-resistance mechanism in Actinoplanes teichomyceticusâthe producer of the last-resort-drug teicoplaninâhas been intensively studied in recent years, posing relevant questions about the role of Tei3 sensor histidine kinase. In the current work, the molecular properties of Tei3 were investigated. The setup of a GPA-responsive assay system in the model Streptomyces coelicolor allowed us to demonstrate that Tei3 functions as a non-inducible kinase, conferring high levels of GPA resistance in A. teichomyceticus. The expression of different truncated versions of tei3 in S. coelicolor indicated that both the transmembrane helices of Tei3 are crucial for proper functioning. Finally, a hybrid gene was constructed, coding for a chimera protein combining the Tei3 sensor domain with the kinase domain of VanS, with the latter being the inducible Tei3 ortholog from S. coelicolor. Surprisingly, such a chimera did not respond to teicoplanin, but indeed to the related GPA A40926. Coupling these experimental results with a further in silico analysis, a novel scenario on GPA-resistance and biosynthetic genes co-evolution in A. teichomyceticus was hereby proposed.",

In metazoans, the SAH homolog Mesh1 is reported to function in cofactor metabolism by hydrolyzing NADPH to NADH. In bacteria, SAHs are often identified in genomes with toxic alarmone synthetases for self-resistance. Here, we characterized a bacterial orphan SAH, i.e., without a toxic alarmone synthetase, in the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. <i>campestris</i> (<i>Xcc</i>SAH) and found that it metabolizes both cellular alarmones and cofactors. <i>In vitro</i>, <i>Xcc</i>SAH displays abilities to hydrolyze multiple nucleotides, including pppGpp, ppGpp, pGpp, pppApp, and NADPH. <i>In vivo</i>, X. campestris pv. <i>campestris</i> cells lacking <i>sah</i> accumulated higher levels of cellular (pp)pGpp and NADPH compared to wild-type cells upon amino acid starvation. In addition, X. campestris pv. <i>campestris</i> mutants lacking <i>sah</i> were more sensitive to killing by Pseudomonas during interbacterial competition. Interestingly, loss of <i>sah</i> also resulted in reduced growth in amino acid-replete medium, a condition that did not induce (pp)pGpp or pppApp accumulation. Further metabolomic characterization revealed strong depletion of NADH levels in the X. campestris pv. <i>campestris</i> mutant lacking <i>sah</i>, suggesting that NADPH/NADH regulation is an evolutionarily conserved function of both bacterial and metazoan SAHs and Mesh1. Overall, our work demonstrates a regulatory role of bacterial SAHs as tuners of stress responses and metabolism, beyond functioning as antitoxins. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Small alarmone hydrolases (SAHs) comprise a widespread family of alarmone metabolizing enzymes. In metazoans, SAHs have been reported to control multiple aspects of physiology and stress resistance through alarmone and NADPH metabolisms, but their physiological functions in bacteria is mostly uncharacterized except for a few reports as antitoxins. Here, we identified an SAH functioning independently of toxins in the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. <i>campestris</i>. We found that <i>Xcc</i>SAH hydrolyzed multiple alarmones and NADPH <i>in vitro</i>, and X. campestris pv. <i>campestris</i> mutants lacking <i>sah</i> displayed increased alarmone levels during starvation, loss of interspecies competitive fitness, growth defects, and strong reduction in NADH. Our findings reveal the importance of NADPH hydrolysis by a bacterial SAH. Our work is also the first report of significant physiological roles of bacterial SAHs beyond functioning as antitoxins and suggests that SAHs have far broader physiological roles and share similar functions across domains of life.",

We determined a 2.6âÃ resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure of a ternary complex between <i>Escherichia coli</i> topoisomerase DNA gyrase, a 217âbp double-stranded DNA fragment and albicidin. Albicidin employs a dual binding mechanism where one end of the molecule obstructs the crucial gyrase dimer interface, while the other intercalates between the fragments of cleaved DNA substrate. Thus, albicidin efficiently locks DNA gyrase, preventing it from religating DNA and completing its catalytic cycle. Two additional structures of this trapped state were determined using synthetic albicidin analogues that demonstrate improved solubility, and activity against a range of gyrase variants and <i>E. coli</i> topoisomerase IV. The extraordinary promiscuity of the DNA-intercalating region of albicidins and their excellent performance against fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria holds great promise for the development of last-resort antibiotics.",

        "pmc_abstract": "Biofilms are mono- or multispecies microbial communities enclosed in an extracellular matrix (EPS). They have high potential for dissemination and are difficult to remove. In addition, biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant strains (MDRs) are even more aggravated if we consider antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as an important public health issue. Quorum sensing (QS) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are mechanisms that significantly contribute to the recalcitrance (resistance and tolerance) of biofilms, making them more robust and resistant to conventional sanitation methods. These mechanisms coordinate different strategies involved in AMR, such as activation of a quiescent state of the cells, moderate increase in the expression of the efflux pump, decrease in the membrane potential, antimicrobial inactivation, and modification of the antimicrobial target and the architecture of the EPS matrix itself. There are few studies investigating the impact of the use of inhibitors on the mechanisms of recalcitrance and its impact on the microbiome. Therefore, more studies to elucidate the effect and applications of these methods in the food production chain and the possible combination with antimicrobials to establish new strategies to control MDR biofilms are needed.",

Amino acid substitutions in TTX-resistant lineages appear to be positionally convergent with changes in homologous residues associated with reductions in TTX block. We used homology modeling coupled with docking simulations to test whether positionally convergent substitutions generate functional convergence at the level of TTX-channel interactions. We found little evidence that amino acids at convergent positions generated similar patterns among TTX-resistant animal lineages across several metrics, including number of polar contacts, polar contact position, and estimates of binding energy. Though binding energy values calculated for TTX docking were reduced for some TTX-resistant channels, not all TTX-resistant channels and not all of our analyses returned reduced binding energy values for TTX-resistant channels. Our results do not support a simple model of toxin resistance where a reduced number of bonds between TTX and the channel protein prevents blocking. Rather models that incorporate flexibility and movement of the protein overall may better describe how homologous substitutions in the channel cause changes in TTX block.",

While Ï<sub>C</sub> distinguishes natural selection from genetic noise and phylogenetic errors in simulation and real examples, its accuracy allows an exploratory genome-wide search of adaptive molecular convergence without phenotypic hypothesis or candidate genes. Using gene expression data, we explored over 20 million branch combinations in vertebrate genes and identified the joint convergence of expression patterns and protein sequences with amino acid substitutions in functionally important sites, providing hypotheses on undiscovered phenotypes. We further extended our method with a heuristic algorithm to detect highly repetitive convergence among computationally non-trivial higher-order phylogenetic combinations. Our approach allows bidirectional searches for genotype-phenotype associations, even in lineages that diverged for hundreds of millions of years.",

However, there are still many unknown fields regarding the beneficial plant-microbe interactions. In this study, we have assessed the amount or impact of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-derived genes in plants that have potentials to confer abiotic stress resistance. We have identified a total of 235 gene entries in fourteen high-quality plant genomes belonging to phyla <i>Chlorophyta</i> and <i>Streptophyta</i> that confer resistance against a wide range of abiotic pressures acquired from microbes through independent HGTs. These genes encode proteins contributed to toxic metal resistance (e.g., ChrA, CopA, CorA), osmotic and drought stress resistance (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>/proline symporter, potassium/proton antiporter), acid resistance (e.g., PcxA, ArcA, YhdG), heat and cold stress resistance (e.g., DnaJ, Hsp20, CspA), oxidative stress resistance (e.g., GST, PoxA, glutaredoxin), DNA damage resistance (e.g., Rad25, Rad51, UvrD), and organic pollutant resistance (e.g., CytP450, laccase, CbbY). Phylogenetic analyses have supported the HGT inferences as the plant lineages are all clustering closely with distant microbial lineages. Deep-learning-based protein structure prediction and analyses, in combination with expression assessment based on codon adaption index (CAI) further corroborated the functionality and expressivity of the HGT genes in plant genomes. A case-study applying fold comparison and molecular dynamics (MD) of the HGT-driven CytP450 gave a more detailed illustration on the resemblance and evolutionary linkage between the plant recipient and microbial donor sequences. Together, the microbe-originated HGT genes identified in plant genomes and their participation in abiotic pressures resistance indicate a more profound impact of HGT on the adaptive evolution of plants.",

Streptomycetes, producers of a plethora of secondary metabolites, encode up to five different ClpP homologs, and the composition of their unusually complex Clp protease machinery has remained unsolved. Here, we report on the composition of the housekeeping Clp protease in <i>Streptomyces</i>, consisting of a heterotetradecameric core built of ClpP1, ClpP2, and the cognate Clp-ATPases ClpX, ClpC1, or ClpC2, all interacting with ClpP2 only. Antibiotic acyldepsipeptides (ADEP) dysregulate the Clp protease for unregulated proteolysis. We observed that ADEP binds <i>Streptomyces</i> ClpP1, but not ClpP2, thereby not only triggering the degradation of nonnative protein substrates but also accelerating Clp-ATPase-dependent proteolysis. The explanation is the concomitant binding of ADEP and Clp-ATPases to opposite sides of the ClpP1P2 barrel, hence revealing a third, so far unknown mechanism of ADEP action, i.e., the accelerated proteolysis of native protein substrates by the Clp protease. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Clp proteases are antibiotic and anticancer drug targets. Composed of the proteolytic core ClpP and a regulatory Clp-ATPase, the protease machinery is important for protein homeostasis and regulatory proteolysis. The acyldepsipeptide antibiotic ADEP targets ClpP and has shown promise for treating multiresistant and persistent bacterial infections. The molecular mechanism of ADEP is multilayered. Here, we present a new way how ADEP can deregulate the Clp protease system. Clp-ATPases and ADEP bind to opposite sides of <i>Streptomyces</i> ClpP, accelerating the degradation of natural Clp protease substrates. We also demonstrate the composition of the major <i>Streptomyces</i> Clp protease complex, a heteromeric ClpP1P2 core with the Clp-ATPases ClpX, ClpC1, or ClpC2 exclusively bound to ClpP2, and the killing mechanism of ADEP in <i>Streptomyces</i>.",

Moreover, research technologies, such as toxicomicrobiomics, culturomics and genomics, especially in combination, have revealed that the human microbiota may be a promising source of beneficial taxa or other components, with the potential to metabolise and biodegrade xenobiotics. These may have possible applications in several health areas, including in animals or plants for detoxification or in the environment for bioremediation. This approach would be of particular interest for antimicrobials, with the potential to ameliorate antimicrobial resistance development.

Its biosynthesis uses a prodrug resistance mechanism: a non-toxic precursor assembled in the cytoplasm is activated after export to the periplasm. This activation is mediated by ClbP, an inner-membrane peptidase with an N-terminal periplasmic catalytic domain and a C-terminal three-helix transmembrane domain. Although the transmembrane domain is required for colibactin activation, its role in catalysis is unclear. Our structure of full-length ClbP bound to a product analog reveals an interdomain interface important for substrate binding and enzyme stability and interactions that explain the selectivity of ClbP for the N-acyl-D-asparagine prodrug motif. Based on structural and biochemical evidence, we propose that ClbP dimerizes to form an extended substrate-binding site that can accommodate a pseudodimeric precolibactin with its two terminal prodrug motifs in the two ClbP active sites, thus enabling the coordinated activation of both electrophilic warheads.",

In this study, 54 endophytes were isolated and molecularly identified from <i>R. roxburghii</i>. The preliminary screening using the plate confrontation method resulted in 15 different endophytic strains showing at least one strong inhibition or three or more moderate inhibition against the 12 tested strains. Further re-screening experiments based on the disc diffusion method demonstrated that <i>Epicoccum latusicollum</i> HGUP191049 and <i>Setophoma terrestris</i> HGUP190028 had excellent antagonistic activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test for extracellular metabolites finally indicated that HGUP191049 had lower MIC values and a broader antimicrobial spectrum, compared to HGUP190028. Genomic, non-target metabolomic, and comparative genomic studies were performed to understand the biosynthetic capacity of the screened-out endophytic fungus. Genome sequencing and annotation of HGUP191049 revealed a size of 33.24 megabase pairs (Mbp), with 24 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), where the putative antimicrobial compounds, oxyjavanicin, patulin and squalestatin S1 were encoded by three different BGCs, respectively. In addition, the non-targeted metabolic results demonstrated that the strain contained approximately 120 antimicrobial secondary metabolites and was structurally diverse. Finally, comparative genomics revealed differences in pathogenicity, virulence, and carbohydrate-active enzymes in the genome of <i>Epicoccum</i> spp. Moreover, the results of the comparative analyses presumed that <i>Epicoccum</i> is a promising source of antimicrobial terpenes, while oxyjavanicin and squalestatin S1 are antimicrobial compounds shared by the genus.

All isolates could be divided into two morphotypes of single and mycelial cells. We found that the most common mycelial morphotype was observed among soldiers and least common among larvae in the studied laboratory colony. The representative of this morphotype was identified as <i>Streptomyces globisporus</i> subsp. <i>globisporus</i> 4-3 by a polyphasic approach. It was established using a <i>E. coli</i> JW5503 pDualRep2 system that crude broths of mycelial isolates inhibited protein synthesis in reporter strains, but it did not disrupt the in vitro synthesis of proteins in cell-free extracts. An active compound was extracted, purified and identified as albomycin Î´2.

        "pmc_abstract": "The human gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin is a possible key driver of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Understanding colibactin's biological effects remains difficult owing to the instability of the proposed active species and the complexity of the gut microbiota. Here, we report small molecule boronic acid inhibitors of colibactin biosynthesis. Designed to mimic the biosynthetic precursor precolibactin, these compounds potently inhibit the colibactin-activating peptidase ClbP. Using biochemical assays and crystallography, we show that they engage the ClbP binding pocket, forming a covalent bond with the catalytic serine. These inhibitors reproduce the phenotypes observed in a clbP deletion mutant and block the genotoxic effects of colibactin on eukaryotic cells. The availability of ClbP inhibitors will allow precise, temporal control over colibactin production, enabling further study of its contributions to CRC. Finally, application of our inhibitors to related peptidase-encoding pathways highlights the power of chemical tools to probe natural product biosynthesis.",

The biosynthesis of nucleoside antibiotics has been studied but is still far from completion. The present study characterized enzymes Cpz10, Cpz15, Cpz27, Mur17, Mur23 out of caprazamycin/muraymycin biosynthetic gene cluster, particularly the nonheme Î±KG-dependent enzyme Cpz10. Cpz15 is a Î²-hydroxylase converting uridine mono-phosphate to uridine 5' aldehyde, then incorporating with threonine by Mur17 (Cpz14) to form 5'-C-glycyluridine. Cpz10 hydroxylates synthetic 11 to 12 in vitro. Major product 13 derived from mutant Îcpz10 is phosphorylated by Cpz27. Î²-Hydroxylation of 11 by Cpz10 permits the maturation of caprazamycin, but decarboxylation of 11 by Mur23 oriented to muraymycin formation. Cpz10 recruits two iron atoms to activate dioxygen with regio-/stereo-specificity and commit electron/charge transfer, respectively. The chemo-physical interrogations should greatly advance our understanding of caprazamycin biosynthesis, which is conducive to pathway/protein engineering for developing more effective nucleoside antibiotics.",

Based on these studies it was assumed that direct physical contact is a prerequisite for the metabolic reaction that involves a fungal amino acid starvation response and activating chromatin modifications at the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). Here we show that not physical contact, but a guanidine containing macrolide, named polaramycin B, triggers the response. The substance is produced constitutively by the bacterium and above a certain concentration, provokes the production of ORS. In addition, several other secondary metabolites were induced by polaramycin B. Our genome-wide transcriptome analysis showed that polaramycin B treatment causes downregulation of fungal genes necessary for membrane stability, general metabolism and growth. A compensatory genetic response can be observed in the fungus that included upregulation of BGCs and genes necessary for ribosome biogenesis, translation and membrane stability. Our work discovered a novel chemical communication, in which the antifungal bacterial metabolite polaramycin B leads to the production of antibacterial defence chemicals and to the upregulation of genes necessary to compensate for the cellular damage caused by polaramycin B.",

The polyketide rumbrin (<b>1</b>) is a lipid peroxide production and calcium accumulation inhibitor, which contains a chlorinated pyrrole moiety that is a rare chemical feature in fungal natural products. Here, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) <i>rum</i> of <b>1</b> and its isomer 12<i>E</i>-rumbrin (<b>2</b>) from <i>Auxarthron umbrinum</i> DSM3193, and elucidate their biosynthetic pathway based on heterologous expression, chemical complementation, and isotopic labeling. We show that rumbrins are assembled by a highly reducing polyketide synthase (HRPKS) that uniquely incorporates a proline-derived pyrrolyl-CoA starer unit, and followed by methylation and chlorination. Sequent precursor-directed biosynthesis was able to yield a group of rumbrin analogues. Remarkably, inspired by the presence of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-Nef-associated gene in the <i>rum</i> cluster, we predicted and pharmacologically demonstrated rumbrins as potent inhibitors of HIV at the nanomolar level. This work enriches the recognition of unconventional starter units of fungal PKSs and provides a new strategy for genome mining-guided drug discovery.",

However, host-endophyte interaction in the production of secondary metabolite is a new less exploited area that is overcoming barriers and evolving as one of the prospective fields. Endophytes such as bacteria or fungi have the ability to produce some of the secondary metabolites that mimic the plant metabolites therefore escaping the host defence system. Coumarin is one such metabolite with immense biological functions. Most of the studies have demonstrated coumarin production from fungal endophytes but not bacterial endophytes. Herein, we present an overview of all the coumarin derivatives produced from endophytic sources and their biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, the review also throws light on the isolation of these coumarins and different derivatives with respect to their biological activity. The biotransformation of coumarin derivatives by the action of endophytic fungi is also elaborated. The present review provides an insight on the challenges faced in the coumarin production through fungal endophytes.",

In particular, adequate precursors of secondary metabolites as well as sophisticated post modification systems make some high-yield industrial strains of <i>Streptomyces</i> the promising chassis for the heterologous production of natural products. However, lack of efficient genetic tools for the manipulation of industrial strains, especially the episomal vector independent tools suitable for large DNA fragment deletion, makes it difficult to remold the metabolic pathways and streamline the genomes in these strains. In this respect, we developed an efficient deletion system independent of the episomal vector for large DNA fragment deletion. Based on this system, four large segments of DNA, ranging in length from 10 kb to 200 kb, were knocked out successfully from three industrial <i>Streptomyces</i> strains without any marker left. Notably, compared to the classical deletion system used in <i>Streptomyces</i>, this deletion system takes about 25% less time in our cases. This work provides a very effective tool for further genetic engineering of the industrial <i>Streptomyces</i>.",

A principal limitation for fundamental biochemical studies of these modular megasynthases, as well as for their applications in biotechnology, is the challenge associated with manipulating the natural microorganism that produces a polyketide of interest. To ameliorate this limitation, over the past decade several genetically amenable microbes have been developed as heterologous hosts for polyketide biosynthesis. Here we review the state of the art as well as the difficulties associated with heterologous polyketide production.
