The wide host range and success of these pathogens has been attributed to the production of a photoactivated toxin, cercosporin. We engineered tobacco for resistance to Cercospora nicotianae utilizing two strategies: 1) transformation with cercosporin autoresistance genes isolated from the fungus, and 2) transformation with constructs to silence the production of cercosporin during disease development. Three C. nicotianae cercosporin autoresistance genes were tested: ATR1 and CFP, encoding an ABC and an MFS transporter, respectively, and 71cR, which encodes a hypothetical protein. Resistance to the pathogen was identified in transgenic lines expressing ATR1 and 71cR, but not in lines transformed with CFP. Silencing of the CTB1 polyketide synthase and to a lesser extent the CTB8 pathway regulator in the cercosporin biosynthetic pathway also led to the recovery of resistant lines. All lines tested expressed the transgenes, and a direct correlation between the level of transgene expression and disease resistance was not identified in any line. Resistance was also not correlated with the degree of silencing in the CTB1 and CTB8 silenced lines. We conclude that expression of fungal cercosporin autoresistance genes as well as silencing of the cercosporin pathway are both effective strategies for engineering resistance to Cercospora diseases where cercosporin plays a critical role.", "Data Availability", "All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Fungi in the genus Cercospora cause devastating crop losses on a wide range of crop plants world-wide including sugar beet, corn, and coffee as well as many vegetable and ornamental species [1]. The wide host range and lack of disease resistance in many host species has been attributed to the fungus\u2019 production of a photoactivated perylenequinone toxin, cercosporin (for review see [2\u20134]). Cercosporin is a photosensitizing compound that absorbs light energy to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) as well as other reactive oxygen species (ROS) [5\u20138]. In host plants the cercosporin-generated ROS cause peroxidation of the host cell membrane lipids, leading to membrane breakdown, death of host cells and leakage of nutrients needed by the fungus for tissue colonization [9\u201311]. Studies in several Cercospora-host systems have documented the importance of cercosporin in disease by documenting reductions in disease development by mutants deficient for cercosporin production [12\u201317]. The importance of light, required for cercosporin photoactivation, in disease symptom development has also been documented in both coffee and sugar beet [18, 19].", "Fungi in the genus Cercospora cause devastating crop losses on a wide range of crop plants world-wide including sugar beet, corn, and coffee as well as many vegetable and ornamental species [1].

Unlike free-radical forms of ROS such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen is not a common part of cellular reactions, and most cells lack effective resistance mechanisms. Compounds have been identified that quench singlet oxygen [20]. Carotenoids are among the most effective quenchers of singlet oxygen, and play a role in defense against singlet oxygen generated as part of photosynthesis [21]. But there is little evidence for a role for quenchers in resistance to photosensitizer toxicity in cells [3]. Consistent with its production of singlet oxygen, cercosporin has been shown to be almost universally toxic, with toxicity documented not only to plants, but also to mice, bacteria, oomycetes, and many fungi [8, 22].", "Singlet oxygen is a non-radical, but highly reactive species of ROS [4].

Thus, extensive studies have been conducted to characterize autoresistance mechanisms in Cercospora fungi as a strategy to identify genes that may have utility in engineering cercosporin-resistant plants. Characterization of endogenous quenchers including carotenoids, as well as antioxidant enzymes and general antioxidant activity were not correlated with cercosporin resistance in fungi (for review see [3, 23]). Vitamin B6 production was correlated with autoresistance, however expression of Cercospora B6 biosynthetic genes (PDX1, PDX2) in tobacco did not elevate B6 levels or cercosporin resistance due to down-regulation of the endogenous tobacco PDX genes [24]. Identification of the zinc cluster transcription factor CRG1 that regulates cercosporin resistance and production [25] led to the recovery of putative resistance genes through the use of a subtractive hybridization strategy of genes differentially expressed between the wild type strain and a crg1 mutant [26]. Differentially regulated genes identified through this strategy have subsequently been characterized for a possible role in resistance through characterization of mutants [27] as well as by the ability to impart cercosporin resistance to the cercosporin-sensitive fungus Neurospora crassa [28, 29].", "Although cercosporin has been shown to be almost universally toxic, Cercospora species are resistant to its toxicity [22].

The utility of HIGS to protect plants against fungal pathogens was first demonstrated by Nowara et al. [30] with the obligate powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis. It has since been shown to function against fungi with diverse modes of pathogenicity, including other obligate pathogens such as rusts [31], as well as species of Fusarium [32], Verticillium [33], and Sclerotinia [34] (for review see [35]).

The polyketide synthase (PKS) in the pathway was first identified through recovery from cercosporin-deficient mutants of C. nicotianae created by restriction enzyme-mediated insertion (REMI) [13]. Other genes in the pathway were then identified through sequencing of flanking regions. This work identified a cluster of eight genes (CTB1-CTB8) encoding methyltransferases, oxidoreductases, a transporter, and a transcription factor in addition to the PKS [36].

Plants transformed to silence CTB1 showed high levels of resistance compared to cv \u2018Hicks\u2019 (Fig 5A), with 6 of 14 lines assayed showing significantly less disease. Symptoms on resistant plants were similar to what was seen with the ATR1-transformed plants, with smaller lesions that did not expand (Fig 2). Analysis of transgene expression in non-inoculated plants (Fig 5B) with one-way ANOVA indicated that were significant differences between the normalized transcripts. Post hoc comparisons of normalized transcripts using Dunnett\u2019s test with Line 58 as the control group indicated that the expression of the CTB1 construct was statistically significant in six lines (p \u2264 0.05). Lines 29, 36, 123, and 169 that had statistically significant CTB1 construct expression were also found to be highly resistant to the pathogen. Although the CTB1 construct was highly expressed in Lines 3 and 8, no significant disease resistance was found. However, Lines 15 and 129, that did not have statistically significant CTB1 expression, were found to be highly resistant to the pathogen.

Aerial mycelium was removed by brushing the growth with sterile distilled water so as to expose the stroma. Plates were incubated for an additional week at 18\u00b0C in the dark. Conidia were harvested with sterile distilled water supplemented with 0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), and the concentration adjusted to 5 x 104/ml. Spores were atomized onto the abaxial and adaxial sides of tobacco leaves. The entire plant was covered with bags for 4 days to allow symptom development under conditions of high humidity. In each experiment, each transgenic line along with the vector control and wild type cv \u2018Hicks\u2019 was represented by five biological replicates, and the entire study was repeated once again. Symptoms were monitored weekly for up to six weeks post inoculation. Disease severity of each line was assessed as previously described [13] as the proportion of the mean number of coalesced lesions on five leaves of each of five plants per line compared to wild type cv \u2018Hicks\u2019. To test the role of the transgene in conferring resistance to C. nicotianae, the disease severity in transgenic lines were compared to the wild type control and the data were statistically analyzed using the Satterthwaite-Smith-Welch test [41, 42].", "Supporting information", "Supporting information", "Transgene expression in tobacco transformed to express C. nicotianae cercosporin-resistance genes.", "Transgene expression in tobacco transformed to express C. nicotianae cercosporin-resistance genes.", "A.\nATR1 expression in haploid tobacco plants normalized with the tobacco ubiquitin gene.
