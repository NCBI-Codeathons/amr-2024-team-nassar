["The spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) creates a challenge for global health security, rendering many previously successful classes of antibiotics useless. Unfortunately, this also includes glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs), such as vancomycin and teicoplanin, which are currently being considered last-resort drugs. Emerging resistance towards GPAs risks limiting the clinical use of this class of antibiotics\u2014our ultimate line of defense against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive pathogens. But where does this resistance come from? It is widely recognized that the GPA resistance determinants\u2014van genes\u2014might have originated from GPA producers, such as soil-dwelling Gram-positive actinobacteria, that use them for self-protection. In the current work, we present a comprehensive bioinformatics study on the distribution and phylogeny of GPA resistance determinants within the Actinobacteria phylum. Interestingly, van-like genes (vlgs) were found distributed in different arrangements not only among GPA-producing actinobacteria but also in the non-producers: more than 10% of the screened actinobacterial genomes contained one or multiple vlgs, while less than 1% encoded for a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). By phylogenetic reconstructions, our results highlight the co-evolution of the different vlgs, indicating that the most diffused are the ones coding for putative VanY carboxypeptidases, which can be found alone in the genomes or associated with a vanS/R regulatory pair.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Starting with the discovery of penicillin [1], humanity has been involved in a never-ending arms race between life-threatening bacterial pathogens and antibiotics, either natural, semisynthetic or completely synthetic. An estimation made by the United Nations Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance in 2014 predicted that the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will cause up to 10 million deaths per year by 2050 [2]. However, recent events might make this number even more grim: the worldwide health crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to an increase in antibiotic use and misuse, which, in turn, is likely to further accelerate AMR diffusion [3]. AMR has rendered many previously successful groups of antibiotics non-functional, leaving us hiding behind the \u201cthin red line\u201d of last-resort drugs, capable to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are a class of non-ribosomally synthesized, highly cross-linked, halogenated and glycosylated natural products, which are considered frontline drugs against Gram-positive MDR pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Clostridioides difficile, etc. [4].", "Starting with the discovery of penicillin [1], humanity has been involved in a never-ending arms race between life-threatening bacterial pathogens and antibiotics, either natural, semisynthetic or completely synthetic.

Types I\u2013IV are compounds having a cross-linked heptapeptide core highly glycosylated and/or lipidated; their molecular target in pathogens is lipid II [6], a highly conserved macromolecule among bacteria that is essential for cell-wall biosynthesis [7]. Types I\u2013IV GPAs form five hydrogen bonds with the d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) terminus of the lipid II pentapeptide stem (Figure 1a) [8,9,10,11]. Such binding terminates upstream transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions, preventing the formation of mature peptidoglycan (PG). An old term describes Types I\u2013IV GPAs very precisely: dalbaheptides [12], meaning d-Ala-d-Ala-binding antibiotics with heptapeptide structures. Lipid II is obviously involved in the cell wall biosynthesis of dalbaheptide producers as well. Thus, to avoid suicide during GPA production, producing strains need self-resistance mechanisms. This topic was recently revised in detail [13,14]. In brief, two main mechanisms of cell-wall remodeling exist in dalbaheptide-producers as well as in the resistant pathogens [15,16]. The first involves three genes\u2014vanHAX\u2014coding for: (i) an \u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase, VanH, which stereospecifically reduces pyruvate to d-lactate (d-Lac); (ii) a d-Ala-d-Lac ligase, VanA; and (iii) a d,d-dipeptidase, VanX. VanX removes the d-Ala-d-Ala termini of lipid II pentapeptide stems, while VanA prepares a pool of d-Ala-d-Lac dipeptides, which MurF, a UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide ligase, installs instead of the terminal d-Ala-d-Ala. As a result, GPAs form four instead of five hydrogen bonds with such d-Ala-d-Lac termini, and the repulsion of lone electron pairs between oxygen atoms contributes to make these GPA-lipid II complexes unstable (Figure 1b). The second resistance mechanism requires the expression of a d,d-carboxypeptidase VanY, which cleaves the terminal d-Ala residues of lipid II pentapeptide stems, hampering GPA complex formation with such truncated lipid II derivatives (Figure 1c). So, the formed tetrapeptide-carrying lipid II molecules are still able to enter the transpeptidation and transglycosylation steps, yielding a 3-3 crosslinked mature peptidoglycan [17]. Expression of either vanHAX or vanY (known overall as van genes) is often inducible and regulated by a VanRS two-component regulatory pair. There, a sensor histidine kinase VanS (de)phosphorylates transcriptional regulator VanR in response to the extracellular presence of GPAs, and phosphorylated VanR activates the expression of the van genes involved in cell-wall remodeling. In dalbaheptide producers, van genes are always localized inside the borders of GPA biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which group genes devoted to antibiotic biosynthesis, transport and regulation, guaranteeing co-regulation of self-resistance with antibiotic production. The only exception is the chloroeremomycin BGC in Kibdelosporangium aridum A82846, which apparently does not include van genes [18].", "GPAs are produced by high G-C content soil-dwelling actinobacteria and could be divided into five types according to their chemical structures and molecular targets [5].

Finally, in our reconstructed phylogeny of VanY-like carboxypeptidases, the dbv and noc cluster-encoded VanY-proteins out-grouped (Y1 cluster) all other ones (Figure 10). We believe that such a picture is as a result of a series of HGT events. In our hypothesis, summarized in Figure 12, first, noc and dbv protoclusters recruited the vanY gene from the vanRSY triad present in the common ancestor of Nonomuraea spp., whereas the WAC 01424 and kistamycin ancestral BGCs did not acquire it. Then, noc and dbv, through another HGT event, were introduced in the Nonomuraea ancestors already carrying the vanRSY triad. Another HGT event delivered WAC 01424 BGC to Nonomuraea sp. WAC 01424 and kistamycin BGC to Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 55076, explaining why the vanRSY triad is the only resistance determinant in these strains.

We were able to reconstruct one of the most obvious ones, observed for the self-resistance phenotype in the A40926 producer N. gerenzanensis, which relied on the expression of the cluster-situated vanY-like gene\u2014dbv7. In the corresponding dbv7 knockout mutant, GPA resistance was significantly reduced, but not completely abolished [62]. Screening the full genome of N. gerenzanensis [67], the reason became evident: an additional vanY allele was found far away the dbv BGC. Interestingly, this allele was co-localized with a vanRS-like regulatory pair, whereas dbv7 was not. The same situation was observed for N. coxensis DSM 45129\u2014a recently described producer of A40926-like Type IV GPA [40,68]: a cluster-situated dbv7 homologue (almost identical) and a non-cluster-situated vanRSY-triad were identified in its genome.

As reported above, actinobacteria are an extremely abundant source of vlgs. It is quite difficult to consider that such a variety of vlgs in GPA non-producing actinobacteria is needed to protect them versus the GPA producers, which definitively seemed quite rare. Alternatively, vlgs might have natural functions in cell-wall remodeling in response to environmental and/or developmental triggers. For instance, VanY-like M15B carboxypeptidases are extremely abundant in actinobacteria, forming diverged evolutionary lineages; it is tempting to suspect their role in, for instance, cell-wall remodeling during the life cycle (a function indeed shown for some other d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase [69]). Our finding of the so-called pdx operon, common for Micromonosporales, contributed to such an idea. This putative operon is composed of a PALP-like serine-threonine dehydratase, a Ddl ligase and a VanX-like dipeptidase genes, co-localized with a vanRS-like regulatory pair. This organization suggests an alternative mechanism of peptidoglycan precursor remodeling, which reminds the introduction of d-Ala-d-Ser termini in the cell wall of some enterococci, showing a low level of GPA resistance [14]. It is unknown whether the pdx operon is functional and if its expression leads to some cell wall remodeling, but such a case indeed merits further experimental evaluation.", "Is the GPA resistance the original function of vlgs?

However, we hope that this should provoke other in silico, in vitro and in vivo studies, which will shed light on such an important question such as GPA resistance.
