["Abstract", "To identify the potential role of the 3\u2010hydroxyl group of the pyridine ring in nosiheptide (NOS) for its antibacterial activity against Gram\u2010positive pathogens, enzymatic glycosylation was utilized to regio\u2010selectively create a monoglycosyl NOS derivative, NOS\u2010G. For this purpose, we selected OleD, a UDP glycosyltransferase from Streptomyces antibioticus that has a low productivity for NOS\u2010G. Activity of the enzyme was increased by swapping domains derived from OleI, both single and in combination. Activity enhancement was best in mutant OleD\u201010 that contained four OleI domains. This chimer was engineered by site\u2010directed mutagenesis (single and in combination) to increase its activity further, whereby variants were screened using a newly\u2010established colorimetric assay. OleD\u201010 with I117F and T118G substitutions (FG) had an increased NOS\u2010G productivity of 56%, approximately 70 times higher than that of wild\u2010type OleD. The reason for improved activity of FG towards NOS was structurally attributed to a closer distance (<3\u2009\u00c5) between NOS/sugar donor and the catalytic amino acid H25. The engineered enzyme allowed sufficient activity to demonstrate that the produced NOS\u2010G had enhanced stability and aqueous solubility compared to NOS. Using a murine MRSA infection model, it was established that NOS\u2010G resulted in partial protection within 20\u2009h of administration and delayed the death of infected mice. We conclude that 3\u2010hydroxypyridine is a promising site for structural modification of NOS, which may pave the way for producing nosiheptide derivatives as a potential antibiotic for application in clinical treatment.", "A monoglycosyl nosiheptide, which exhibit improved solubility and stability compared to nosiheptide, was created by enzymatic glycosylation. By enzyme engineering coupled with a new colorimetric method, a chimeric enzyme with approximately 70 times higher activity was constructed. These findings suggest the potential for structural modifications at the 3\u2010hydroxypyridine site of nosiheptide to develop novel nosiheptide derivatives with improved properties for clinical treatment.", "Zhao, L.\n, \nXu, Y.\n, \nChen, M.\n, \nWu, L.\n, \nLi, M.\n, \nLu, Y.\n et al.

As previously reported, NOS exerts its antibacterial effect by inserting itself into the GTPase\u2010associated centre (GAC) of the bacterial ribosome, which is formed by protein L11 and 23S rRNA of the 50S subunit, consequently disturbing bacterial protein biosynthesis (Harms et al.,\u00a02008).

NOS contains a dehydroalanine tail and an indolic acid moiety, and owing to its structural complexity, there are few regions suitable to be modified (Figure\u00a01). This largely limits the diversity of NOS\u2010based analogues for drug development. To increase the variation in potential structural variants, the central 3\u2010hydroxypyridine ring of NOS would be an ideal target for modification, based on its chemical reactivity, but the required deep\u2010cleft binding mode in the GAC of the bacterial ribosome, which is crucial for its mode of action (Tsutsumi et al.,\u00a02014), might prevent modifications of the 3\u2010hydroxypyridine group, as it might inactivate the compound.

At the lowest dose tested (2.5\u2009mg/kg), the survival rate in the NOS\u2010G\u2010treated group was 50% at 20\u2009h post\u2010infection, which is slightly better than NOS (37.5%)\u00a0(Figure\u00a07A). A higher therapeutic effect of NOS\u2010G became apparent at higher dosages (5 and 10\u2009mg/kg): at 20\u2009h, NOS\u2010G\u2010treated animals had a survival rate of 62.5%, while it was still 37.5% for the NOS\u2010treated group (Figure\u00a07B,C).

For this, an enzymatic strategy was designed that allowed site\u2010specific modification without the formation of byproducts. The starting point was glycosyltransferase OleD that could perform the desired site\u2010specific glycosylation, albeit with low efficiency. Its activity was subsequently enhanced, first by single domain swapping, then by combining promising domains, and finally by site\u2010directed mutagenesis, again singly and in combination. The procedures were enabled by use of a semi\u2010high\u2010throughput screening method for activity. The resulting variant FG exhibiting a 70\u2010fold improvement in the biosynthetic activity of NOS\u2010G compared to OleD. This increased activity was due to a tighter structure of FG when interacting with UDPG and NOS. The shorter distance (<3\u2009\u00c5) of the substrate to H25 in the catalytic site to the sugar most likely contributed to a more efficient SN2\u2010type transglycosylation. The glycosylation of NOS improved its solubility and stability and its antibacterial activity was conserved. In addition, NOS\u2010G possessed a promising in vivo protective effect towards MRSA infection in mice. We conclude that the 3\u2010hydroxypyridine ring of NOS is a suitable target for modification to create novel NOS\u2010derived analogues with a better druggability in the future.", "To identify whether modification of the 3\u2010hydroxyl group of the core pyridine ring in NOS was feasible, despite its presumed contribution to antibacterial activity of the compound, we glycosylated the site.
