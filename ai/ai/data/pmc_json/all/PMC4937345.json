["Secondary metabolites are defined as organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction of an organism. They are widely believed to be responsible for interactions between the producing organism and its environment, with the producer avoiding their toxicities. In our experiments, however, none of the randomly selected 44 species representing different groups of plants and insects can avoid autotoxicity by its endogenous metabolites once made available. We coined the term endocides (endogenous biocides) to describe such metabolites that can poison or inhibit the parent via induced biosynthesis or external applications. Dosage-dependent endocides can selectively induce morphological mutations in the parent organism (e.g., shrubbiness/dwarfism, pleiocotyly, abnormal leaf morphogenesis, disturbed phyllotaxis, fasciated stems, and variegation in plants), inhibit its growth, development, and reproduction and cause death than non-closely related species. The propagule, as well as the organism itself contains or produces adequate endocides to kill itself.", "Secondary metabolites (SMs) usually refer to the organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction of an organism123. Some authors have suggested that SMs may have no explicit role in the internal economy of the producing organism4, but it is usually believed that they are responsible for interactions between the producing organism and its environment, particularly in defense135678910. To refer to biochemical interactions between plants, in 1937, H. Molisch coined the term allelopathy, which was later defined as any direct or indirect, stimulatory and inhibitory effect by one plant (including microorganisms) on another through production of chemical compounds that escape into the environment11. Allelopathy is usually interspecific12. Intraspecific allelopathy, commonly known as autotoxicity occurs when a plant releases toxic chemical substances into the environment that inhibit germination and growth of the same plant species1213. Since the 1970s, such an exogenous autotoxicity has drawn great interests of scientists from various fields. Recent evidences have indicated that many autotoxicity cases are primarily caused by the indirect effects of autotoxins via influencing microbes or parasitic organisms in the environment14151617. Some identified autotoxins or allelochemicals are not necessarily responsible for allelopathy because they may not reach sufficient concentrations and duration in soils to display direct inhibitory effects on their neighbors17. Endogenous autotoxicity in producers induced by their own SMs has never been seriously addressed18. In fact, it has been widely believed that a species can avoid self-toxicity by its own toxic metabolites and thus many studies have focused on organisms\u2019 avoidance and detoxification mechanisms19202122232425262728.", "To reveal the internal role of some SMs in their producers, we investigated 44 species representing different groups of plants and insects found in the Southeastern United States. It was found that no organism can avoid either endogenous or exogenous autotoxicity by its own metabolites once made available via induced biosynthesis or external applications. The fact of unavoidance and commonness of endogenous autotoxicity in the producing organism induced by its endocides does not support the common knowledge that a species can avoid self-toxicity by its own toxic metabolites1920212223. We further found that these agents were usually more toxic to the producing species and its closely-related species than to others. This phenomenon cannot be explained by allelopathy, defense or any other existing theory. Thus, we coined the new term endocides (endogenous biocide) to describe such selective toxic SMs that cause both endogenous and exogenous autotoxicity.", "Results", "Results", "Morphological Mutations Induced by Prolonged Soaking of Fruits (Seeds) in Water", "Morphological Mutations Induced by Prolonged Soaking of Fruits (Seeds) in Water", "Morphological Mutations Induced by Prolonged Soaking of Fruits (Seeds) in Water", "The prolonged soaking of fruits (seeds) in water induced abnormal morphogenesis in each of the 12 woody and herbaceous species investigated (Supplementary Table S1).", "The prolonged soaking of fruits (seeds) in water induced abnormal morphogenesis in each of the 12 woody and herbaceous species investigated (Supplementary Table S1).", "The prolonged soaking of fruits (seeds) in water induced abnormal morphogenesis in each of the 12 woody and herbaceous species investigated (Supplementary Table S1).", "Without any treatment, none of the total 422 seedlings of Camptotheca lowreyana developed any abnormal leaves (vs those grown in the native range of China).

Extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure. 410\u2009g EtOH extracts were obtained. The extracts were suspended in MeOH-H2O (1\u2009L, 1:1, v/v), and partitioned successively with hexane and EtOAc. Three fractions were obtained, named hexane fraction (97.8\u2009g), EtOAc fraction (31.9\u2009g), and H2O fraction (220\u2009g). 0.4\u2009g hexane fraction was further separated by HPLC (Zorbax SB-C18 column, CH3CN/H2O:45/55 and 98/2, detection 210\u2009nm) to give five subfractions: F45-1 (12.5\u2009mg), F45-2 (3.8\u2009mg), F45-3 (4.7\u2009mg), F45-4 (8.2\u2009mg), and F100 (67\u2009mg). 5,6,7,8-Tetramethoxycoumarin was purified from F45-3 by HPLC (Zorbax SB-C18 column, CH3CN/H2O:45/55, detection 280\u2009nm). NMR experiments were performed on a JEOL ECS-400. NMR data were reported as \u03b4 (ppm) values and referenced to the solvent used. Bioassays: The experimental plants were four-month-old T. sebifera seedlings grown in pots with Miracle Grow Potting Mix soil in the greenhouse with about 30 seedlings on each pot. Each of the fractions, subfractions, and 5,6,7,8-tetramethoxycoumarin was prepared as 50\u2009\u03bcL experimental solution with nanopure water at 5% concentration each, respectively. For each testing sample, 10\u2009\u03bcL of each experimental solution was applied by pipet on the upper surface of each of the three randomly selected mature leaves and the lower surface of each of three randomly selected mature leaves, respectively. On each seedling, the untreated leaves served as the controls. For active hexane fraction, foliar spray of 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5% concentrations were applied with a dosage of 20\u2009mL on 15 seedlings in a pot with a total 30 plants in total. The remaining untreated 15 seedlings in each pot served as the controls. The foliar treatments were replicated three times. The same foliar applications of the 5% hexane fraction were also applied on at least three one-year-old seedlings of the following species at the dosage of 10\u2009mL per plant: P. taeda, Vitis rotundifolia, Myrica heterophylla, Rhus aromatica, Dichanthelium boscii, and Desmodium sp. The leaf surfaces of the experimental plants were checked daily for two weeks by a \u00d760 portable microscope linked to an iPhone.", "Additional Information", "Additional Information", "How to cite this article: Li, S. et al.
