["Aspergillus section Circumdati encompasses several species that express both beneficial (e.g., biochemical transformation of steroids and alkaloids, enzymes and metabolites) and harmful compounds (e.g., production of ochratoxin A (OTA)). Given their relevance, it is important to analyze the genetic and metabolic diversity of the species of this section. We sequenced the genome of Aspergillus affinis CMG 70, isolated from sea water, and compared it with the genomes of species from section Circumdati, including A. affinis\u2019s strain type. The A. affinis genome was characterized considering secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and transporters. To uncover the biosynthetic potential of A. affinis CMG 70, an untargeted metabolomics (LC-MS/MS) approach was used. Cultivating the fungus in the presence and absence of sea salt showed that A. affinis CMG 70 metabolite profiles are salt dependent. Analyses of the methanolic crude extract revealed the presence of both unknown and well-known Aspergillus compounds, such as ochratoxin A, anti-viral (e.g., 3,5-Di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid and epigallocatechin), anti-bacterial (e.g., 3-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol, l-pyroglutamic acid, lecanoric acid), antifungal (e.g., lpyroglutamic acid, 9,12,13-Trihydroxyoctadec-10-enoic acid, hydroxyferulic acid), and chemotherapeutic (e.g., daunomycinone, mitoxantrone) related metabolites. Comparative analysis of 17 genomes from 16 Aspergillus species revealed abundant CAZymes (568 per species), secondary metabolite BGCs (73 per species), and transporters (1359 per species). Some BGCs are highly conserved in this section (e.g., pyranonigrin E and UNII-YC2Q1O94PT (ACR toxin I)), while others are incomplete or completely lost among species (e.g., bikaverin and chaetoglobosins were found exclusively in series Sclerotiorum, while asperlactone seemed completely lost). The results of this study, including genome analysis and metabolome characterization, emphasize the molecular diversity of A. affinis CMG 70, as well as of other species in the section Circumdati.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Aspergillus section Circumdati encompasses 27 species, many of which are economically, biotechnologically, and medically important, and having vast impacts on human and animal health [1]. Circumdati species are notorious for producing highly toxic fungal compounds (e.g., ochratoxin A (OTA)) [2]. In contrast, some Circumdati species, such as A. ochraceus and A. slerotiorum, are used for the biotransformation of steroids and alkaloids, while A. melleus is an important source of proteolytic enzymes [3]. The yellow aspergilli A. affinis was the first species of the section Circumdati isolated from a freshwater environment (submerged decomposing leaf litter), and is able to produce OTA [4], posing a potential danger for marine organisms and for their consumers. However, little is known about A. affinis\u2018s ecological role or biotechnological potential. Marine compounds from fungi represent the largest category of marine natural products (MNPs) [5] and are the most widely reported to exhibit a diverse source and remarkable relevant bioactivities, including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities [6,7,8,9,10,11]. Recently, during a survey of marine fungi from the Portuguese coast, Gon\u00e7alves et al. [12] isolated a strain of A. affinis from sea water (strain CMG 70). Aspergillus affinis CMG 70 produces amylases, cellulases, chitinases, proteinases and xylanases, and has antimicrobial, cytotoxic and antioxidant activities [13]. The bioactivity profile of A. affinis CMG 70 suggests that it has the potential to represent a useful source of novel secondary metabolites. In fact, more than 30% of metabolites isolated from fungi so far are from Aspergillus or Penicillium [14].", "Aspergillus section Circumdati encompasses 27 species, many of which are economically, biotechnologically, and medically important, and having vast impacts on human and animal health [1].

There were 3005 predicted genes annotated as transporters against TC database, accounting for 25.6% of the total predicted genes for A. affinis (Table 4 and Table S4). Genes from the TC 2 class are the most abundant transporters of A. affinis CMG 70 genome (32.7%), followed by genes from the classes TC 1 (19.6%), TC 9 (16.1%), and TC 3 (15.3%). The A. affinis genome encodes transporters involved in the transport of zinc, sugar/H+, florfenicol, pantothenate, and various MFS (Major Facilitator Superfamily) transporters. It is known that MFS transporters in fungi play an important role in multidrug resistance [41] and are required for fungal growth under stress conditions [42]. Furthermore, we identified several genes coding for glycerol, inositol, sodium, and chloride transporters. By increasing these compounds\u2019 production and accumulation and others such as erythritol, arabitol, xylitol, mannitol, mycosporines and nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., glycine, betaine, and free amino acids), the cell is able to maintain a positive turgor pressure [43]. Two mechanisms explain how fungi tolerate high salinity levels: their high affinity transport systems and osmoregulatory capacity. Marine fungi produce and accumulate specific solutes that allow them to function in saltwater [44]. For example, in the halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, the myo-inositol and its transporters play a major role in the tolerance to salt stress [45]. Moreover, Kogej et al. [43] and Plemenita\u0161 et al. [46] also showed the production of glycerol, erythritol, arabitol, and mannitol and the involvement of alkali metal transporters (K+/Na+) by the halophilic fungus Hortaea werneckii as osmoadaptation. All four polyols have also been detected in A. flavus and A. parasiticus in response to osmotic stress [47]. We annotated many genes involved in glycerol, mannitol, inositol, trehalose, sorbitol, glycine, and betaine biosynthetic process, suggesting that A. affinis has adaptability mechanisms to thrive in saltwater. Furthermore, genes essential for the MAPK high osmolarity (Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1-Ssk2-Pbs2-Hog1 and Sho1-Cdc42-Ste20(or Cla4)-Ste11-Pbs2-Hog1) and cell wall stress cascades (Wsc1-Rom2-Rho1-Pkc1-Bck1-Mkk1-Slt2) were identified, resulting in glycerol accumulation to reduce the osmotic pressure and in cell wall remodeling. Gladfelter et al. [48] suggests that the high-osmolarity-glycerol signaling pathway seems in part to be linked to the water balance, cell stability and turgor in fungi.

The A. affinis genome encodes transporters involved in the transport of zinc, sugar/H+, florfenicol, pantothenate, and various MFS (Major Facilitator Superfamily) transporters. It is known that MFS transporters in fungi play an important role in multidrug resistance [41] and are required for fungal growth under stress conditions [42]. Furthermore, we identified several genes coding for glycerol, inositol, sodium, and chloride transporters. By increasing these compounds\u2019 production and accumulation and others such as erythritol, arabitol, xylitol, mannitol, mycosporines and nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., glycine, betaine, and free amino acids), the cell is able to maintain a positive turgor pressure [43]. Two mechanisms explain how fungi tolerate high salinity levels: their high affinity transport systems and osmoregulatory capacity. Marine fungi produce and accumulate specific solutes that allow them to function in saltwater [44]. For example, in the halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, the myo-inositol and its transporters play a major role in the tolerance to salt stress [45]. Moreover, Kogej et al. [43] and Plemenita\u0161 et al. [46] also showed the production of glycerol, erythritol, arabitol, and mannitol and the involvement of alkali metal transporters (K+/Na+) by the halophilic fungus Hortaea werneckii as osmoadaptation. All four polyols have also been detected in A. flavus and A. parasiticus in response to osmotic stress [47]. We annotated many genes involved in glycerol, mannitol, inositol, trehalose, sorbitol, glycine, and betaine biosynthetic process, suggesting that A. affinis has adaptability mechanisms to thrive in saltwater. Furthermore, genes essential for the MAPK high osmolarity (Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1-Ssk2-Pbs2-Hog1 and Sho1-Cdc42-Ste20(or Cla4)-Ste11-Pbs2-Hog1) and cell wall stress cascades (Wsc1-Rom2-Rho1-Pkc1-Bck1-Mkk1-Slt2) were identified, resulting in glycerol accumulation to reduce the osmotic pressure and in cell wall remodeling.
