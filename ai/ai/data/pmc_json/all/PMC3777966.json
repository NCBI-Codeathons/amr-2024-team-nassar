In this study, we describe in detail a novel hybrid NRPS-PKS cluster identified in the plasmid of the\u00a0\n\nAlteromonas\n\nmacleodii\n strain AltDE1 and analyze its relatedness to other similar gene clusters in a sequence-based characterization. This is a mobile cluster, flanked by transposase-like genes, that has even been found inserted into the chromosome of some \n\nAlteromonas\n\nmacleodii\n strains. The cluster contains separate genes for NRPS and PKS activity. The sole PKS gene appears to carry a novel acyltransferase domain, quite divergent from those currently characterized. The predicted specificities of the adenylation domains of the NRPS genes suggest that the final compound has a backbone very similar to bleomycin related compounds. However, the lack of genes involved in sugar biosynthesis indicates that the final product is not a glycopeptide. Even in the absence of these genes, the presence of the cluster appears to confer complete or partial resistance to phleomycin, which may be attributed to a bleomycin-resistance-like protein identified within the cluster. This also suggests that the compound still shares significant structural similarity to bleomycin. Moreover, transcriptomic evidence indicates that the NRPS-PKS cluster is expressed. Such sequence-based approaches will be crucial to fully explore and analyze the diversity and potential of secondary metabolite production, especially from increasingly important sources like marine microbes.", "Background", "Background", "Marine bacteria are gaining prominence as producers of secondary metabolites, which display unique structural and functional characteristics [1,2]. This emerging source of natural products is of particular importance due to a decline in antibiotic drug discovery from their traditional source (i.e., soil microbes) over the past two decades [3]. Polyketides (PKs) and non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) represent one of the larger classes of marine microbial natural products with important clinical and ecological impacts [4]. Although different in overall structure and fundamental chemical building blocks, they exhibit striking similarities in their biosynthetic assembly mechanisms [5]. Polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), large modular enzymes, are responsible for the synthesis of PKs and NRPs, respectively. The striking similarities between PKs and NRPSs, both structural and catalytic, allow for the formation of hybrid clusters that contain elements of each class [5]. These hybrid NRPS-PKS clusters provide even greater variety for potential secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms [6].", "Marine bacteria are gaining prominence as producers of secondary metabolites, which display unique structural and functional characteristics [1,2].

Here, we detected the intact motif in seven of the 14 C domains (Table S2 in File S1). Previous studies have characterized six functional C domain groups: starter C domain (acylates the first amino acid), LCL (catalyzes peptide bond formation between 2 L-amino acids), DCL (catalyzes peptide bond formation between a D- and L- amino acid), Heterocyclization domain (CYC, catalyzes peptide bond formation and subsequent cyclization of certain amino acids), epimerization (E, flips chirality of last amino acid), dual E/C (catalyzes both epimerization and condensation) [56]. More recently, two additional groups have been proposed: modified amino acid domains (modAA, modify the incorporated amino acids) and hybrid domains (H, catalyze the condensation of an amino acid to an aminated polyketide) [33]. Using the classification described above, we were able to classify 10 of the 14 condensation domains identified in the pAMDE1 cluster (Figure S1 in File S1). The phylogenetic tree allows the identification of five LCL, two modAA, two CYC, and one H domains. In a number of branches, the pAMDE1 C domains were most closely related to bleomycin. Of the two CYC domains, one (ORF 108 C2) contained a slightly altered motif (QXXXXDX) from the conserved CYC domain motif (DXXXXDX); however, cluster analysis still clustered this domain with the CYC domains. One C-domain also clustered with DCL domains (as predicted by the NAPDOS server [33]), suggesting the incorporation of a D-amino acid into the final product. However, the pAMDE1 cluster did not present any evidence of any epimerization domains that are essential for this incorporation [56,57,58]. Classification of C-domains as DCL may be misleading as some C-domains, especially those related to glycopeptide biosynthesis are actually LCL domains hypothesized to be derived from DCL domains [56]. This appears to be the case in the prediction of a DCL domain in bleomycin by the NAPDOS server, when the gene cluster coding for bleomycin does not display any evidence for an epimerization domain. Moreover, examination of the phylogenetic tree of the C-domains reveals that the domains classified as DCL by the NAPDOS server, also do not present high bootstrap values. For example, both the bleomycin and the pAMDE1 C-domain are part of a branch that has weak bootstrap support (only 20%). In comparison, several other predictions have much better support e.g CYC domain (100%), the modAA (100%), LCL (81%).

However, the pAMDE1 cluster did not present any evidence of any epimerization domains that are essential for this incorporation [56,57,58]. Classification of C-domains as DCL may be misleading as some C-domains, especially those related to glycopeptide biosynthesis are actually LCL domains hypothesized to be derived from DCL domains [56]. This appears to be the case in the prediction of a DCL domain in bleomycin by the NAPDOS server, when the gene cluster coding for bleomycin does not display any evidence for an epimerization domain. Moreover, examination of the phylogenetic tree of the C-domains reveals that the domains classified as DCL by the NAPDOS server, also do not present high bootstrap values. For example, both the bleomycin and the pAMDE1 C-domain are part of a branch that has weak bootstrap support (only 20%). In comparison, several other predictions have much better support e.g CYC domain (100%), the modAA (100%), LCL (81%). Taken together, this suggests that D-amino acids are not incorporated into the final product of the pAMDE1 cluster.", "The A domains in the NRPS proteins are responsible for recruiting amino-acid monomers to be incorporated in to the final product produced by the cluster.

Transcriptomic data for the pAMDE1 cluster provide strong support that the NRPS-PKS cluster is being expressed. The genes in the cluster coding for the NRPS and PKS activities are located in separate ORFs, and further analysis of the PKS protein indicates that this particular PKS gene carries a novel acyltransferase domain. Despite the similarities of the protein domain architectures of pAMDE1 to those from the bleomycin family, the lack of genes involved in sugar biosynthesis in the pAMDE1 cluster suggests that the final compound produced by AltDE1 is not a glycopeptide. The similarities in the predicted specificities of the adenylation domains of pAMDE1and known specificities of bleomycin cluster adenylation domains suggested that the final compound of pAMDE1 has a bleomycin-like backbone.
