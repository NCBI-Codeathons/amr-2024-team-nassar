["Actinobacteria\n is a large and diverse phylum of bacteria that contains medically and ecologically relevant organisms. Many members are valuable sources of bioactive natural products and chemical precursors that are exploited in the clinic and made using the enzyme pathways encoded in their complex genomes. Whilst the number of sequenced genomes has increased rapidly in the last 20 years, the large size, complexity and high G+C content of many actinobacterial genomes means that the sequences remain incomplete and consist of large numbers of contigs with poor annotation, which hinders large-scale comparative genomic and evolutionary studies. To enable greater understanding and exploitation of actinobacterial genomes, specialized genomic databases must be linked to high-quality genome sequences. Here, we provide a curated database of 612 high-quality actinobacterial genomes from 80 genera, chosen to represent a broad phylogenetic group with equivalent genome re-annotation. Utilizing this database will provide researchers with a framework for evolutionary and metabolic studies, to enable a foundation for genome and metabolic engineering, to facilitate discovery of novel bioactive therapeutics and studies on gene family evolution.

The role of nutrient-sensing in regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis is well known [26], with the enzyme glucokinase (Glk) playing a central role in carbon-catabolite repression (CCR) in \nStreptomyces\n [27]. In most bacteria, CCR is mediated by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS), yet in Streptomyces, glucose uptake is mediated by the major-facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, glucose permease (GlcP), and there is evidence for direct interaction between Glk and GlcP, which may mediate CCR [28]. Understanding the nature and distribution of these enzymes will play a key role in developing industrial fermentations with glucose as major carbon source. Investigating the distribution of the glucose permease/glucokinase system across the phylum shows that GlcP and Glk have been the subject of gene expansion events in some members of the \nStreptomycetales\n, most notably the \nStreptomyces\n, with a patchy distribution of the Glk/GlcP system across the remainder of the phylum (Table S2; genus tab). However, where the Glk/GlcP system is found, the number of expansion events observed is greater for Glk than for GlcP (Fig. 2a, b). The phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2a, b) clearly show two clades for Glk and GlcP within the \nStreptomycetales\n (interactive trees are available via Microreact [29]: Glk \u2013 https://microreact.org/project/w_KDfn1xA/5a178533, and GlcP \u2013 https://microreact.org/project/VBUdiQ5_k/045c95e1). However, these clades differ in the number of sequences, with the Glk clades being equal in number, suggesting that a duplication event has occurred within the \nStreptomycetales\n (Fig. 2b). The is consistent throughout the order, with the patterns largely the same as observed for \nStreptomyces coelicolor\n. This species has two ROK-family ATP-dependent glucokinases, SCO2126 (glkA) and SCO6260, that share around 50\u200a% amino acid sequence identity, and each is found in one of the distinct clades (permease-associated kinases and orphan kinases (Fig. 2b). Whilst SCO2126 is a GlcP-associated kinase, the gene encoding SCO6260 is located in an operon including genes encoding a putative carbohydrate ABC-transporter system, which has been reported elsewhere [30]. SCO6260 appears to be the only glucokinase in the database that is associated with an ABC-transporter. This may suggest that expansion of the Glk gene family in \nStreptomycetales\n might have occurred to extend the number of CCR-mediating kinases in the genome, adding increased regulatory complexity to carbohydrate metabolism in this group of organisms that use CCR as a major regulator of specialized metabolism.", "To demonstrate the utility of ActDES, the glucose permease/glucokinase system of the \nActinobacteria\n was investigated. The role of nutrient-sensing in regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis is well known [26], with the enzyme glucokinase (Glk) playing a central role in carbon-catabolite repression (CCR) in \nStreptomyces\n [27]. In most bacteria, CCR is mediated by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS), yet in Streptomyces, glucose uptake is mediated by the major-facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, glucose permease (GlcP), and there is evidence for direct interaction between Glk and GlcP, which may mediate CCR [28]. Understanding the nature and distribution of these enzymes will play a key role in developing industrial fermentations with glucose as major carbon source. Investigating the distribution of the glucose permease/glucokinase system across the phylum shows that GlcP and Glk have been the subject of gene expansion events in some members of the \nStreptomycetales\n, most notably the \nStreptomyces\n, with a patchy distribution of the Glk/GlcP system across the remainder of the phylum (Table S2; genus tab). However, where the Glk/GlcP system is found, the number of expansion events observed is greater for Glk than for GlcP (Fig. 2a, b). The phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2a, b) clearly show two clades for Glk and GlcP within the \nStreptomycetales\n (interactive trees are available via Microreact [29]: Glk \u2013 https://microreact.org/project/w_KDfn1xA/5a178533, and GlcP \u2013 https://microreact.org/project/VBUdiQ5_k/045c95e1). However, these clades differ in the number of sequences, with the Glk clades being equal in number, suggesting that a duplication event has occurred within the \nStreptomycetales\n (Fig. 2b).

A detailed examination of these clades by species (Table S2; species tab) shows the presence of both scenarios. There are duplicated enzymes located within the same clade (as observed in \nS. coelicolor\n; group I) or additional copies of the permease that are located in a phylogenetically distinct clade, which lacks congruence with the RpoB tree [15], and remarkably consists entirely of sequences from the genus \nStreptomyces\n (group II; Fig. 2a). This suggests that they may have been acquired via HGT. The expansive nature of the duplicated Glk enzymes compared to GlcP may be due to the role played in CCR by the GlkA enzymes [27], and the different transcriptional activities under glycolytic and gluconeogenic conditions [31], yet quite how these different Glk enzymes interact with the permease(s) under various conditions requires further experimental investigation to understand their exact physiological role, and how this may be translated into industrial strain improvement processes.", "The two clades for GlcP within the \nStreptomycetales\n differ in size, suggesting either gene duplication followed by gene loss or an expansion through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has occurred.
