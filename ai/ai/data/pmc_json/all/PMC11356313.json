["In this study, the transcriptome profiles of tissue\u2013cultured grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. \u00d7 Vitis labrusca L.: Rose Honey) seedlings inoculated with fungal endophytes Epicoccum layuense R2-21 (Epi R2-21) and Alternaria alternata XHYN2 (Alt XHYN2), were analyzed at three different time points (6 h, 6 d, and 15 d). A total of 4783 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was found, of which 1853 (6 h), 3878 (6 d), and 4732 (15 d) were differentially expressed relative to those of the control in endophyte Epi R2-21 treatments, while a total of 5898 DEGs, of which 2726 (6 h), 4610 (6 d), and 3938 (15 d) were differentially expressed in endophyte Alt XHYN2 treatments. DEGs enriched in secondary metabolic pathways, plant\u2013pathogen interaction, and hormone signalling were further analysed. The upregulated DEGs in the Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 treatments, both enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), were mainly involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and circadian rhythms\u2013plant and plant\u2013pathogen interactions, similar to the trend observed in our previous study conducted on the cultivar \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019 (Vitis vinifera L.). Taken together with the results obtained from the cultivar \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019, it was found that tissue-cultured seedlings of the cultivar \u2018Rose Honey\u2019 induced a stronger defence response to fungal endophyte infection than that of the cultivar \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019, and inoculation with the endophyte Alt XHYN2 triggered a stronger response than inoculation with the endophyte Epi R2-21. In addition, the protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network revealed that the genes VIT_16s0100g00910, encoding CHS, and VIT_11s0065g00350, encoding CYP73A, were involved in secondary metabolism and thus mediated in the resistance mechanism of grapevine on both the cultivars. The results showed that inoculation with the endophytes Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 had a great ability to induce defence responses and reprogram the gene expression profiles in different grapevine cultivars, which deepens our knowledge of the interaction between fungal endophytes and grapevine and gives hints for grape quality management in viticulture using candidate fungal endophytes.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Endophytes are special microorganisms that live within plants with no obvious symptoms and establish interactions with plants ranging from mutualism to pathogenicity [1]. Some researchers have tended to define the term \u2018endophytes\u2019 as referring only to the habitat of the organisms and not to their functions, i.e., all microorganisms that colonize in the internal tissues of plants for all or part of their life [2]. Endophytes, as important cooperative partners of the host plants during their growth and development, have a major impact on the physiological metabolism of the host plant, which helps or stimulates the host plant to defence stresses [3]. Many studies have shown that endophytes are repositories of bioactive metabolites with pharmacological activities, such as antimicrobial, antitumour, antibiotic, antioxidant, and immunological agents [4]. The exploration of them has become a hot spot as the interaction between endophytes and the host plant is gradually being uncovered. Therefore, it is of great value to elucidate the interactive mechanism between plants and endophytes in order to explore and unlock the potential application of endophytes.", "Endophytes are special microorganisms that live within plants with no obvious symptoms and establish interactions with plants ranging from mutualism to pathogenicity [1].

In recent years, the theory of balanced antagonism has emerged as a more accurate explanation of the interaction between the host plant and endophytes [6]. According to this theory, endophytes possess virulence factors that confer self\u2212resistance to toxic metabolites of the host [7,8]. Asymptomatic colonization is a balance of antagonisms between plants and endophytes. When endophytic virulence and plant defence are in equilibrium, the endophyte manages to grow in the host plant and remains asymptomatic or avirulent [7,9]. However, the plant\u2013endophyte interaction is not simply a balance between virulence and defence, and the regulatory network or mechanisms are much more complex [10].", "Endophytes can colonize the host plant in a manner similar to that of pathogen invasion [5], and host plants can synthesize a variety of stress\u2013induced metabolites to defend themselves against stress.

Discussion", "As a crucial cooperative partner of the grapevine, endophytes strongly influence the growth of the host plant, even the physiological metabolism [3]. During the long\u2013term interaction, endophytes and their host grapevine establish a mutualistic symbiotic relationship.

Most of the studies have tried to explore the reciprocal mechanism of the complex interaction between grapevine and endophytes, but there is still a great gap in knowledge about the exact mechanisms of the interaction.
