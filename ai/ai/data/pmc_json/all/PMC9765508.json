In metazoans, the SAH homolog Mesh1 is reported to function in cofactor metabolism by hydrolyzing NADPH to NADH. In bacteria, SAHs are often identified in genomes with toxic alarmone synthetases for self-resistance. Here, we characterized a bacterial orphan SAH, i.e., without a toxic alarmone synthetase, in the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (XccSAH) and found that it metabolizes both cellular alarmones and cofactors. In vitro, XccSAH displays abilities to hydrolyze multiple nucleotides, including pppGpp, ppGpp, pGpp, pppApp, and NADPH. In vivo, X. campestris pv. campestris cells lacking sah accumulated higher levels of cellular (pp)pGpp and NADPH compared to wild-type cells upon amino acid starvation. In addition, X. campestris pv. campestris mutants lacking sah were more sensitive to killing by Pseudomonas during interbacterial competition. Interestingly, loss of sah also resulted in reduced growth in amino acid-replete medium, a condition that did not induce (pp)pGpp or pppApp accumulation. Further metabolomic characterization revealed strong depletion of NADH levels in the X. campestris pv. campestris mutant lacking sah, suggesting that NADPH/NADH regulation is an evolutionarily conserved function of both bacterial and metazoan SAHs and Mesh1. Overall, our work demonstrates a regulatory role of bacterial SAHs as tuners of stress responses and metabolism, beyond functioning as antitoxins.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "To cope with changing environments, most bacteria produce nucleotide signaling molecules, such as the alarmone guanosine tetra/pentaphosphate [(p)ppGpp] (1) to survive various stresses (2, 3). (p)ppGpp concentrations can range from micromolar to low millimolar levels in cells (4, 5) to directly regulate many central cellular processes, including transcription, translation, DNA replication, and purine metabolism (6\u201311). Apart from (p)ppGpp, nucleotides such as pGpp (12) and AppppA (13) can also function as alarmones, while (p)ppApp has been recently reported as a toxin (14).", "To cope with changing environments, most bacteria produce nucleotide signaling molecules, such as the alarmone guanosine tetra/pentaphosphate [(p)ppGpp] (1) to survive various stresses (2, 3).

XccSAH belongs to the subgroup Mesh1-L (16), which is closely related to subgroup Mesh1, the metazoan SAH with promiscuity to remove the phosphate groups at 3\u2032 for (p)ppGpp and 2\u2032 for NADPH in the ribose ring (32), regardless of the identity of the purine base (A or G) (30). Other SAH homologs, such as Methylobacterium extorquens SAH (30), have been reported to display a more restricted substrate spectrum, hydrolyzing (p)ppApp but not (p)ppGpp. The different substrate spectrum in XccSAH could be associated with the distinct sequence features outside of the highly conserved catalytic residues essential for metal coordination and hydrolysis (Fig.\u00a01B). First, XccSAH lacks a well-defined nicotinamide riboside (NR) interaction motif found in Mesh1. This could explain why XccSAH is as efficient against alarmones as Mesh1 (30), but its efficiency of NADPH hydrolysis is ~40 times less efficient than Mesh1 (32) (~3.63\u2009\u00d7\u2009102 s\u22121 M\u22121 versus ~14.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 s\u22121 M\u22121). Second, while XccSAH can hydrolyze the toxic alarmone pppApp, similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa SAH (29) and M. extorquens SAH (30), it lacks the multiple prolines adjacent to the hydrolase domain (HD) motifs HD5 and -6 (Fig.\u00a01B) proposed to increase substrate promiscuity (29).

XccSAH had higher catalytic efficiency for the alarmones than for NADPH, likely due to the difference between 3\u2032-phosphates in the alarmones versus 2\u2032-phosphates in NADPH (32). For alarmones, XccSAH had higher affinity for (pp)pGpp than pppApp, while catalytic activity was the greatest for pppApp, followed by pppGpp, ppGpp, and pGpp (Table\u00a03). This suggests that XccSAH prefers alarmone substrates with an adenine over guanine nucleobase in addition to a higher number of 5\u2032-phosphates. Physiologically, the different affinities and catalytic activities to substrates could lead to competition for enzyme activity when multiple substrates are present in the cell. The high catalytic efficiency for pppApp by XccSAH likely prioritizes the enzyme toward hydrolysis against toxic (p)ppApp accumulation from interbacterial attack, since hydrolases such as SpoT have no activity against (p)ppApp. The moderate (pp)pGpp hydrolysis efficiency by XccSAH can enable the enzyme to assist (pp)pGpp turnover during stress when the cells have high (pp)pGpp. The lower efficiency of NAPDH hydrolysis suggests that NADPH/NADH regulation by XccSAH is more prominent when the levels of competing alarmone substrates are low and cofactor levels are high, such as during unstressed growth. Thus, XccSAH provides diverse regulation of alarmones and cofactors, according to their relative concentrations in the cell. In addition, gene expression control or interacting regulators may also be present to further modulate XccSAH level and activity.", "Apart from an increased substrate spectrum, the biochemical properties of XccSAH toward different substrates also differed (Table\u00a03). XccSAH had higher catalytic efficiency for the alarmones than for NADPH, likely due to the difference between 3\u2032-phosphates in the alarmones versus 2\u2032-phosphates in NADPH (32). For alarmones, XccSAH had higher affinity for (pp)pGpp than pppApp, while catalytic activity was the greatest for pppApp, followed by pppGpp, ppGpp, and pGpp (Table\u00a03). This suggests that XccSAH prefers alarmone substrates with an adenine over guanine nucleobase in addition to a higher number of 5\u2032-phosphates. Physiologically, the different affinities and catalytic activities to substrates could lead to competition for enzyme activity when multiple substrates are present in the cell. The high catalytic efficiency for pppApp by XccSAH likely prioritizes the enzyme toward hydrolysis against toxic (p)ppApp accumulation from interbacterial attack, since hydrolases such as SpoT have no activity against (p)ppApp. The moderate (pp)pGpp hydrolysis efficiency by XccSAH can enable the enzyme to assist (pp)pGpp turnover during stress when the cells have high (pp)pGpp. The lower efficiency of NAPDH hydrolysis suggests that NADPH/NADH regulation by XccSAH is more prominent when the levels of competing alarmone substrates are low and cofactor levels are high, such as during unstressed growth. Thus, XccSAH provides diverse regulation of alarmones and cofactors, according to their relative concentrations in the cell. In addition, gene expression control or interacting regulators may also be present to further modulate XccSAH level and activity.", "Our finding that XccSAH is an NADPH phosphatase suggests that NADPH hydrolysis is an evolutionarily conserved function of both bacterial and metazoan SAH and Mesh1. Based on our in vitro data, XccSAH has a Km of ~130\u2009\u03bcM to NADPH. This is physiologically relevant to our estimated NADPH concentration of ~570\u2009\u03bcM in X. campestris pv. campestris grown in amino acid-defined media (Table\u00a04). In comparison, NADH concentration was ~87\u2009\u03bcM (Table\u00a04), which was similar to that in exponentially growing E. coli (47). The difference between cellular NADPH and NADH levels in X. campestris pv. campestris suggests that XccSAH can potentially release NADH from NADPH to facilitate growth under suboptimal nutrient conditions. This possibility is supported by our observation that the \u0394sah mutant had reduced NADH and growth, both of which were restored by reintroduction of the sah gene. Compared to metazoan Mesh1, which controls NADPH levels to regulate NADPH-driven pathways such as ferroptosis (32), XccSAH appears to play a role in NADH regeneration from the NADPH pool.", "Our finding that XccSAH is an NADPH phosphatase suggests that NADPH hydrolysis is an evolutionarily conserved function of both bacterial and metazoan SAH and Mesh1.
