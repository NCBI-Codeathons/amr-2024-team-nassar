["Human topoisomerase I (hTopI) is an essential cellular enzyme. The enzyme is often upregulated in cancer cells, and it is a target for chemotherapeutic drugs of the camptothecin (CPT) family. Response to CPT-based treatment is dependent on hTopI activity, and reduction in activity, and mutations in hTopI have been reported to result in CPT resistance. Therefore, hTOPI gene copy number, mRNA level, protein amount, and enzyme activity have been studied to explain differences in cellular response to CPT. We show that Rolling Circle Enhanced Enzyme Activity Detection (REEAD), allowing measurement of hTopI cleavage-religation activity at the single molecule level, may be used to detect posttranslational enzymatic differences influencing CPT response. These differences cannot be detected by analysis of hTopI gene copy number, mRNA amount, or protein amount, and only become apparent upon measuring the activity of hTopI in the presence of CPT. Furthermore, we detected differences in the activity of the repair enzyme tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1, which is involved in repair of hTopI-induced DNA damage. Since increased TDP1 activity can reduce cellular CPT sensitivity we suggest that a combined measurement of TDP1 activity and hTopI activity in presence of CPT will be the best determinant for CPT response.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "DNA-modifying enzymes have been used for many years as drug targets in chemotherapeutic anticancer therapy, which exploits the high transcription and replication rates of cancer cells. As a consequence there has been a growing interest in using genetic and bio-enzymatic information related to these enzymes to predict drug response. An example of DNA-modifying enzymes that are targeted by chemoterapeutic agents is the human enzyme, topoisomerase I (hTopI). hTopI is an essential nuclear enzyme which releases the topological stress resulting during processes such as transcription and replication, where the two DNA strands in the DNA double helix are locally unwound. Enzymatically, hTopI acts through the transient cleavage and subsequent religation of one strand of the DNA helix [1]. The enzyme is overexpressed in a wide range of cancers [2] and it is the sole cellular target of anticancer drugs from the camptothecin (CPT) family mainly used in systemic treatment of colon-, ovarian- and small cell lung cancer [3\u20135]. Recently drugs of the CPT family have also been used for treatment of upper gastrointestinal-, cervical-, and pancreatic cancer [6\u20139]. CPT exhibits its toxicity by intercalating between the bases of the DNA in the hTopI-induced nicks and is stabilized through interactions to both the DNA and hTopI [10]. CPT poisons the cells mainly through the generation of double-stranded DNA breaks caused by S-phase specific collision of replication forks with the hTopI-DNA complexes [11]. However, CPT also damages non-dividing cells through collision of the complexes with DNA repair processes and transcription forks [12]. Stabilization of hTopI-DNA complexes may also occur as the result of cleavage near endogenous DNA lesions (such as nicks, abasic sites, or mismatches) [13,14] but are normally promptly repaired, e.g., through the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) dependent pathway [15]. Thus, enzymatic factors other than hTopI influence the patient response rate for CPT-based treatment, which for CPT monotherapy is around 20%\u201330%, but may be increased to a response rate of around 50% in combination with other agents [16\u201318].", "DNA-modifying enzymes have been used for many years as drug targets in chemotherapeutic anticancer therapy, which exploits the high transcription and replication rates of cancer cells.

In some studies the gene-copy number of hTOPI has been found to correlate with protein expression and with CPT sensitivity [19,20]. In contrast, others have found that neither the mRNA expression nor protein amount of hTopI was predictive for CPT sensitivity whereas hTopI activity correlated with the CPT sensitivity [12,21]. Furthermore, certain mutations in hTopI have been demonstrated to cause CPT resistance [22,23]. We show here that direct determination of the drug response of hTopI is a better predictive marker for cellular CPT sensitivity than looking solely at gene copy number, mRNA amount, protein amount, or hTopI activity without drug. Furthermore, since other factors than hTopI have been shown to influence CPT response we suggest that additional assays, e.g., measurement of TDP1 activity may be included.", "hTopI has been widely evaluated as a predictive biomarker for CPT-based therapy both at gene-, mRNA-, protein-, and activity level with somewhat diverging results.

This enables the 5\u2032end of S(hTopI) to hybridize, and hTopI can subsequently ligate the substrate into a closed circle. The generated circle is hybridized to a surface-attached primer matching the primer binding sequence (indicated by p). Subsequently, Phi29 DNA polymerase mix is added to support RCA and the resulting RCA products are visualized by hybridization of fluorescently labeled probes (matching the Id sequence) and the products analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. (C) REEAD based detection of hTopI activity in 1x, 2x, and 4x dilution of whole cell extract of Caco2 and HT29. One example (Raw data) randomly picked out of 30 individual microscopic images of each triplicate reaction sample is shown. Red signals represent RCA products generated from circularized S(hTopI) (i.e., generated by hTopI activity) and green signals represent RCA products generated from control circles. (D) REEAD based quantification of hTopI activity in 1x, 2x and 4x dilution of whole cell extract of Caco2 and HT29, depicted as mean \u00b1SD in a log2 XY-plot. The data were collected from triplicate reactions and normalized to the mean hTopI activity in undiluted whole cell extract from the Caco2 cell culture.", "Figure 2.(A) Survival assay of Caco2 and HT29 cells in the presence of CPT. Caco2 and HT29 cells were incubated with 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 \u03bcM of CPT for 24 hours before the percentage of viable cells was estimated using the trypan blue exclusion method. All data are presented as the percentage of live cells with mean \u00b1SD from triplicate experiments. (B) Graphic depiction of the TDP1 assay. The TDP1-biosensor is designed to adopt a beacon structure, bringing the quencher (Q) and fluorophore (F) in proximity thus quenching the emission from the fluorophore. In presence of active TDP1, the quencher is removed from the TDP1-biosensor, and the emission of the fluorophore becomes quantifiable.
