["The authors wish it to be known that, in their\u00a0opinion, the first three authors should be regarded as Joint First Authors.", "Abstract", "Two families of DNA glycosylases (YtkR2/AlkD, AlkZ/YcaQ) have been found to remove bulky and crosslinking DNA adducts produced by bacterial natural products. Whether DNA glycosylases eliminate other types of damage formed by structurally diverse antibiotics is unknown. Here, we identify four DNA glycosylases\u2014TxnU2, TxnU4, LldU1\u00a0and LldU5\u2014important for biosynthesis of the aromatic polyketide antibiotics trioxacarcin A (TXNA) and LL-D49194 (LLD), and show that the enzymes provide self-resistance to the producing strains by excising the intercalated guanine adducts of TXNA and LLD. These enzymes are highly specific for TXNA/LLD-DNA lesions and have no activity toward other, less stable alkylguanines as previously described for YtkR2/AlkD and AlkZ/YcaQ. Similarly, TXNA-DNA adducts are not excised by other alkylpurine DNA glycosylases. TxnU4 and LldU1 possess unique active site motifs that provide an explanation for their tight substrate specificity. Moreover, we show that abasic (AP) sites generated from TxnU4 excision of intercalated TXNA-DNA adducts are incised by AP endonuclease less efficiently than those formed by 7mG excision. This work characterizes a distinct class of DNA glycosylase acting on intercalated DNA adducts and furthers our understanding of specific DNA repair self-resistance activities within antibiotic producers of structurally diverse, highly functionalized DNA damaging agents.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Genome stability and integrity are continually challenged by both intrinsic and extrinsic genotoxic agents that generate a diversity of DNA damage through oxidation, alkylation, or hydrolytic deamination (1). Among the most common forms of damage are those derived from alkylating agents, which can potentially modify any of the heteroatoms in duplex DNA. Different sites are alkylated depending on the nature of the DNA-alkylating agents. The resulting DNA damage\u2014including single or double strand breaks, inter- or intra-strand crosslinks, base detachment and base modification\u2014interferes with normal cellular processes, causing DNA mutations, chromosomal rearrangements and instability, which can contribute to heritable diseases and even cell death (2,3). Due to their cytotoxicity, DNA damaging agents often possess certain antimicrobial or antitumor activities, and some of them are used extensively as drugs in cancer treatment (4\u20138).", "Genome stability and integrity are continually challenged by both intrinsic and extrinsic genotoxic agents that generate a diversity of DNA damage through oxidation, alkylation, or hydrolytic deamination (1).

Alkylated DNA is eliminated from the genome predominantly by direct reversal, base excision repair (BER), or nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways (9\u201313). Direct reversal enzymes (e.g.\u00a0alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferases and AlkB-family dioxygenases) extract alkyl substituents from the nucleobase to leave the nucleotide and DNA backbone intact, and can remove not only small base modifications, but also inter-strand DNA crosslinks and bulky exocyclic DNA adducts (14\u201316). BER also removes mainly small but also some bulky and crosslinked adducts (17\u201319), and is initiated by DNA glycosylases that liberate a single modified nucleobase from the DNA backbone through hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond (19\u201323). This reaction forms an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP, or abasic) site that is then incised by an AP endonuclease (e.g.\u00a0Exonuclease III (Xth) or Endonuclease IV (EndoIV, Nfo) in bacteria), generating a gap in the DNA backbone. In contrast, the NER pathway removes bulky or duplex-distorting lesions by endonuclease-catalyzed incisions that isolate a lesion-containing DNA oligonucleotide (24,25). DNA gaps generated in BER and NER are processed, filled, and sealed by the action of a DNA polymerase and DNA ligase.", "In the cell, DNA damage is repaired by several highly conserved pathways (2).

Among them, the DNA glycosylase AlkZ, derived from Streptomyces sahachiroi and which resides within the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of the natural product azinomycin B (AZB), repairs interstrand crosslink (ICL) damage generated by AZB (27\u201329). AZB is a bifunctional alkylating agent that forms ICLs in the major groove by linking the N7 nitrogens of purines in the duplex DNA sequence 5\u2032-d(PuNPy)-3\u2032 (30). AlkZ unhooks AZB-ICLs by cleaving the N-glycosidic bonds of both modified nucleotides, resulting in AP sites that can be processed by the BER pathway (Figure 1C) (19,27). The crystal structure revealed that AlkZ adopts a C-shaped structure in which the concave channel contains a Q\u03a6Q motif essential for catalytic activity and a \u03b2-hairpin predicted to contact the lesion in the minor groove (28). AlkZ belongs to the uncharacterized HTH_42 superfamily of proteins widespread in antibiotic producers and pathogenic bacteria (27). To date, the only other bacterial DNA glycosylase characterized as an ICL glycosylase is another HTH_42 protein, Escherichia coli YcaQ, which has a relaxed specificity relative to S. sahachiroi AlkZ and can cleave N7-linked nitrogen mustard (NM) ICLs and N7-methyl-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (7mG) monoadducts (29).", "Recent studies of self-resistance mechanisms against genotoxic natural products revealed that several unrelated glycosylases participate in removing bulky adducts (26,27).

Trioxacarcin A (TXNA) and LL-D49194 (LLD), two of the most representative compounds in the TXN family, intercalate the base pairs of DNA and have reactive epoxide moieties that covalently alkylate the N7 of guanine in d(GT) dinucleotides, forming stable DNA lesions that impair normal cellular processes (35,36).

We verified that the amount of product observed in this assay was not influenced by the use of NaOH to cleave glycosylase generated AP sites, as similar results were obtained with piperidine (Supplementary Figure S5A,B). Purified enzymes were incubated with either TXNA- or LLD-DNA substrates for 30 min under single turnover conditions. We found that all four enzymes produced a significant amount of product as compared to a no-enzyme control (Figure 4E and\u00a0F). The weaker activity of LldU5 relative to the other three enzymes (Figure 4F) is likely the result of poor protein solubility observed during expression and purification. Single-turnover kinetic analysis showed that TXNA-Gua excision by TxnU4 (kst\u00a0=\u00a04.6 min\u20131) is approximately 4 times faster than S. sahachiroi AlkZ and E. coli YcaQ activity toward AZB-ICL (kst\u00a0=\u00a01.2 min\u20131) and NM-ICL (kst\u00a0=\u00a01.1 min\u20131) substrates, respectively (29) (Figure 4G, Supplementary Figure S5D). The enzyme also efficiently turns over (kmt\u00a0=\u00a00.3 min\u20131) and shows no observable product inhibition, as evidenced by multiple-turnover kinetics (Figure 4G, Supplementary Figure S5D). Thus, these enzymes excise TXNs lesions rapidly and efficiently relative to their distant orthologs. Moreover, the in vitro excision activities of TxnU2/U4 and LldU1/U5 were further confirmed by the detection of excision products in gene deletion mutant strains (Figure 2A, B). Compared to the WT strain, the production of LLD-Gua in gene deletion mutant strains \u0394lldU1 and \u0394lldU5 was respectively reduced 43% and 30%, and the yield of gutingimycin in \u0394txnU2 and \u0394txnU4 was also respectively decreased 95% and 99%, suggesting the glycosylases TxnU2/U4 and LldU1/U5 are functional in vivo.", "For further confirmation, an in vitro gel-based assay was performed to quantify the \u03b2- and \u03b4-elimination products generated by alkaline hydrolysis of the AP site product of base excision (Figure 4D) (28). We verified that the amount of product observed in this assay was not influenced by the use of NaOH to cleave glycosylase generated AP sites, as similar results were obtained with piperidine (Supplementary Figure S5A,B). Purified enzymes were incubated with either TXNA- or LLD-DNA substrates for 30 min under single turnover conditions. We found that all four enzymes produced a significant amount of product as compared to a no-enzyme control (Figure 4E and\u00a0F). The weaker activity of LldU5 relative to the other three enzymes (Figure 4F) is likely the result of poor protein solubility observed during expression and purification. Single-turnover kinetic analysis showed that TXNA-Gua excision by TxnU4 (kst\u00a0=\u00a04.6 min\u20131) is approximately 4 times faster than S. sahachiroi AlkZ and E. coli YcaQ activity toward AZB-ICL (kst\u00a0=\u00a01.2 min\u20131) and NM-ICL (kst\u00a0=\u00a01.1 min\u20131) substrates, respectively (29) (Figure 4G, Supplementary Figure S5D).

Similarly, the TXNs-DNA lesions did not appear to be substrates for the other alkylpurine DNA glycosylases, including AlkZ/YcaQ and YtkR2/AlkD, which also act on bulky lesions (26,27,29,57,58). The lack of activity of TxnU/LldU for less stable N7-alkylguanine adducts and the inability of other glycosylases to hydrolyze TXNA-G indicate that TxnU and LldU are highly specific for their own natural products. The most significant differences between LLD/TXN-G and other known N7-alkylpurine glycosylase substrates are their ability to intercalate into the DNA base stack and their sugar substituents (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S7). Based on the TXNA-DNA crystal structure, TXNA intercalates the d(GT/AC) base step and forms hydrogen bonds with the duplex DNA through the two sugar moieties, leading to the 4-sugar in the minor groove and the 13-sugar residing in the major groove (36). In addition, TXNA extrudes the base near the 3\u2032 end of the alkylating site out of the helix, leading to an increased helical twist (36).", "In terms of specificity, most alkylpurine DNA glycosylases hydrolyze 7mG in addition to their major substrates (23,28,29,40,54\u201356).

An AlkZ-derived homology model of TxnU4 docked against the TXNA-DNA crystal structure provides a rationale for this specificity (Supplementary Figure S7). Our previous work predicted that AlkZ employs two important secondary structural elements to engage the DNA substrate from opposite faces of the DNA\u2014the \u03b211/12-hairpin is posited to contact the lesion in the minor groove, and helix \u03b1I is predicted to make direct contact to the AZB compound from the major groove side (28,29) (Supplementary Figures S6,S7). Because the TXN compounds intercalate both strands of DNA, they protrude from both major and minor groove sides. Consequently, helix \u03b1I and the \u03b211/12-hairpin likely contact TXNs from both grooves, with helix \u03b1I recognizing the C13- or C16-modified sugars on one end and the \u03b211/12-hairpin recognizing C-4 modified sugar on the other end. Interestingly, the sequences and predicted structures of these two recognition elements are not conserved between AlkZ and TxnU/LldU (Supplementary Figures S6 and\u00a0S7), consistent with their predicted roles in recognition of two different classes of natural products.", "To our knowledge, TxnU and LldU are the only DNA glycosylases identified with activity toward intercalated DNA substrates.

Consistently, the HTH_42 enzymes, like their non-base-flipping counterparts YtkR2/AlkD, do not contain residues that would intercalate the DNA helix to stabilize an extruded nucleobase in the active site, nor do they contain a nucleobase binding pocket within the active site (57,59). Instead, the catalytic residues are pre-organized to contact the target N-glycosidic bond within an intact DNA duplex (28) (Supplementary Figures S6, S7). We previously showed that the catalytic motifs of the HTH_42 superfamily are divided into Q\u03a6Q and Q\u03a6D types (29). Sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis showed that the five proteins\u2014AlkZ, LldU1/U5 and TxnU2/U4\u2014are located in three different clades, in which TxnU2 and LldU5 are clustered into one clade, TxnU4 and LldU1 are clustered into another, and AlkZ clustered in a third (Figure 1D). The catalytic motif of TxnU2 and LldU5 is the same as AlkZ and belongs to the Q\u03a6Q type. However, the catalytic motifs of TxnU4 and LldU1 belong to neither Q\u03a6Q nor Q\u03a6D, but instead contain an H\u03a6Q motif (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S6). Our structural models predict the H\u03a6Q side chains to be in the same locations as those in AlkZ Q\u03a6Q, and thus either could reside close enough to the target TXNA-G or LLD-G nucleotide to catalyze hydrolysis (Supplementary Figures S6 and S7) (28). Interestingly, however, our mutational analysis revealed that H\u03a6Q behaves differently than Q\u03a6Q and Q\u03a6D in two respects. First, mutation of only one residue affected base excision, in contrast to Q\u03a6Q (AlkZ) and YcaQ (Q\u03a6D), in which mutation of either residue within the motif affects base excision activity (28,29). Second, the two H\u03a6Q motifs in TxnU4 and LldU1 have different effects for TXNA- and LLD-G adducts, respectively; the histidine in TxnU4 had the greater effect on excision of gutingimycin and the glutamine in LldU1 had the greater effect on LLD-G excision. The cross-reactivity of TxnU4 and LldU1 against TXNs and their high sequence similarity suggests that the two glycosylases have similar substrate recognition pockets, and thus the different effects of their His and Gln mutants most likely stem from the manner in which TXNA-G and LLD-G lesions are positioned within the active site (Supplementary Figure S7). These compounds are distinguished by the sugar substituents at position 13 (TXNA) and 16 (LLD) (Figure 1A), which reside in the major groove and thus likely are contacted by helix \u03b1I as described above (Supplementary Figure S7). Interestingly, TxnU4 and LldU1 contain a 10\u201315-amino acid insertion in helix \u03b1I that the AlphaFold model predicts forms a \u03b2-hairpin (Supplementary Figures S6 and S7). Steric interaction from this helix \u03b1I insertion with the unique 13- and 16-sugar substituents in the major groove would displace the TXNA- and LLD-DNAs differently, placing the target deoxyriboses of TXNA-G and LLD-G in proximity to His43 and Gln45, respectively (Supplementary Figure S7D). Thus, although TxnU4 and LldU1 share the same catalytic motif, the insertion in the predicted drug-binding \u03b1I-helix and the differences in sugar moieties in TXNs may alter how the two proteins engage their substrates. Consistent with this rationale, neither LldU5, AlkZ, nor YcaQ contain the \u03b1I helix insertion, and none of these show a preferential catalytic residue within Q\u03a6Q or Q\u03a6D motifs (28,29).", "Regarding catalysis, the AlkZ/YcaQ/TxnU/LldU family of HTH_42 enzymes act on crosslinked or intercalated substates that are not likely to be extruded from the DNA, as observed for base-flipping glycosylases including human AAG and bacterial AlkA (19,23).
