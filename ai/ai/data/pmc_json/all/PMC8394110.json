["Bacillus siamensis strain B28 was previously isolated from traditional Korean fermented kimchi and inhibited expression of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and \u03b2-catenin in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Here, we determined the complete genome sequence of strain B28 and compared it with other strains to elucidate its potential probiotic properties. Strain B28 does not contain antibiotic resistance-, hemolysin- or enterotoxin-encoding genes. The genome includes genes related to survival in extreme conditions, adhesion in the gut, and synthesis of the bacteriocin. Considering the potential for enhancement of human health, the strain B28 genome encodes genes related to production of eight essential amino acids, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, branched-chain fatty acids, \u03b3-glutamyltransferase, and subtilisin. There are genes for the synthesis of uracil, lipoteichoic acid, glutathione, and several reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzymes. Experimentally, strain B28 exhibited sensitivity to eight antibiotics and antibacterial activity against seven foodborne pathogens. B. siamensis B28 is a safe strain with potential for development as a probiotic.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The Bacillus genus comprises spore-forming bacteria found in various niches, such as oil, agricultural crops, fermented foods, and the human gastrointestinal tract [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Bacillus sp. can also be detected in kimchi using culture-dependent and -independent methods [7,8]. Bacillus spp. play important roles in the enhancement of the sensory properties of fermented foods via their amylolytic, lipolytic, and proteolytic activities [9,10,11,12,13]. Bacillus spp. have been used in the preparation of diverse fermented soybean products in northeast Asia for many centuries [14]. Furthermore, some Bacillus strains exhibit antibacterial activity against food pathogenic bacteria [15,16], anticancer effects on human colon cancer cells [17], and probiotic properties in humans and animals [18].", "The Bacillus genus comprises spore-forming bacteria found in various niches, such as oil, agricultural crops, fermented foods, and the human gastrointestinal tract [1,2,3,4,5,6].

We assumed that the effect on microphthalmia-associated transcription factor contributed to the whitening effects of strain B28 [19]. To find the genetic basis for these effects, we searched the strain B28 genome for tyrosinase inhibitors (for the whitening effect) and regulators of \u03b2-catenin expression. Tyrosinase plays a key role in melanogenesis in mammals, and bacteria produce tyrosinase inhibitors during fermentation [59]. The B28 genome possesses genes for uracil, lipoteichoic acid, and glutathione synthesis; these compounds are tyrosinase inhibitors found in microorganisms [59,60] (Figure 4 and Table S4). Moreover, glutathione is involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species, which induces \u03b2-catenin expression [61]; the B28 genome also encodes several enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, and superoxidase dismutase) that scavenge reactive oxygen species (Table S4). Additionally, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (EC 2.7.11.1) activity could affect \u03b2-catenin expression, and the B28 genome contains eight genes for the production of glycogen synthase kinase-3 [62] (Table S4).", "Previously, B. siamensis strain B28 was found to inhibit the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and \u03b2-catenin in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. \u03b2-catenin is important for carcinogenesis and tumor progression.
