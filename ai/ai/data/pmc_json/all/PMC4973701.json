["Summary", "Microbisporicin is a potent type I lantibiotic produced by the rare actinomycete M\nicrobispora corallina that is in preclinical trials for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin\u2010resistant isolates of S\ntaphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Analysis of the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of microbisporicin, which contains two unique post\u2010translationally modified residues (5\u2010chlorotryptophan and 3, 4\u2010dihydroxyproline), has revealed an unusual regulatory mechanism that involves a pathway\u2010specific extracytoplasmic function sigma factor (MibX)/anti\u2010sigma factor (MibW) complex and an additional transcriptional regulator MibR. A model for the regulation of microbisporicin biosynthesis derived from transcriptional, mutational and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses suggests that MibR, which contains a C\u2010terminal DNA\u2010binding domain found in the LuxR family of transcriptional activators, functions as an essential master regulator to trigger microbisporicin production while MibX and MibW induce feed\u2010forward biosynthesis and producer immunity. Moreover, we demonstrate that initial expression of mib\nR, and thus microbisporicin production, is dependent on the ppGpp synthetase gene (relA) of M\n.\u2009corallina. In addition, we show that constitutive expression of either of the two positively acting regulatory genes, mib\nR or mib\nX, leads to precocious and enhanced microbisporicin production.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post\u2010translationally modified peptides with antimicrobial activity that are produced by a number of Gram\u2010positive bacteria (Li and O'Sullivan, 2012). They contain lanthionine and/or methyl lanthionine bridges, which contribute to their relative resistance to proteolytic cleavage, structural rigidity and target specificity (Chatterjee et\u2009al., 2005). Only a few lantibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters derived from actinobacteria have been characterised thus far \u2013 all of them chromosomally located (Li and O'Sullivan, 2012). These clusters typically contain genes encoding the precursor peptide, enzymes responsible for a variety of posttranslational modifications, proteins involved in export and immunity, and frequently pathway\u2010specific regulatory proteins (Chatterjee et\u2009al., 2005; Arnison et\u2009al., 2013). Microbisporicin is a potent lantibiotic produced by Microbispora corallina (Nakajima et\u2009al., 1999); it is also made by Microbispora sp. American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) PTA5024 and known commercially as NAI\u2010107 (Donadio et\u2009al., 2009; Jab\u00e9s et\u2009al., 2011). It is active against a wide range of Gram\u2010positive pathogens, including multiply drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Microbisporicin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding to lipid II, the immediate precursor for peptidoglycan biosynthesis (Lazzarini et\u2009al., 2005; M\u00fcnch et\u2009al., 2014). The lantibiotic contains one methyllanthionine and three lanthionine bridges, a S\u2010[(Z)\u20102\u2010aminovinyl]\u2010D\u2010cysteine at its C terminus and two unique modifications, 5\u2010chlorotryptophan and 3, 4\u2010dihydroxyproline (Lazzarini et\u2009al., 2005; Castiglione et\u2009al., 2008). The absence of these latter two modifications markedly reduces the potency of the compound (Maffioli et\u2009al., 2014). Previous studies identified a cluster of 20 genes involved in microbisporicin biosynthesis, which to our knowledge, is the largest lantibiotic gene cluster identified thus far (Foulston and Bibb, 2010). It encodes a putative transcriptional activator, MibR, as well as an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor and anti\u2010sigma factor pair, MibX and MibW, respectively, all involved in the regulation of microbisporicin biosynthesis. Foulston and Bibb (2011) suggested a model in which MibR acts as a master regulator to promote low levels of production of the immature, less active form of microbisporicin that lacks the unique modifications referred to earlier; this intermediate then triggers a feed\u2010forward mechanism mediated by the ECF\u2010sigma factor MibX that results in high levels of microbisporicin production. However, the direct targets of MibR and MibX remained to be confirmed experimentally, as did the signal triggering the initial activation of MibR transcription.", "Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post\u2010translationally modified peptides with antimicrobial activity that are produced by a number of Gram\u2010positive bacteria (Li and O'Sullivan, 2012).

Guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) is a key intracellular signalling molecule for sensing nutrient starvation and triggering adaptive responses in a wide range of bacteria. ppGpp induces a rapid response to amino acid starvation in Escherichia coli, Streptomyces species and other bacteria, reducing the expression of genes involved in rapid growth and often activating transcription of genes involved in specialised metabolism (Takano and Bibb, 1994; Bremer and Ehrenberg, 1995; Ochi, 2007; Gaca et\u2009al., 2015). Under conditions of nitrogen limitation, the ribosome\u2010bound RelA synthesises ppGpp in response to uncharged tRNAs that bind to the ribosomal A site (Cashel et\u2009al., 1996). In E.\u2009coli, ppGpp elicits transcriptional changes by interacting directly with RNA polymerase (Magnusson et\u2009al., 2005) while in Bacillus subtilis, ppGpp regulation of gene expression appears to be mediated through GTP pool levels, therefore modulating promoter activity indirectly (Kr\u00e1sn\u00fd and Gourse, 2004). In Streptomyces coelicolor, ppGpp synthesis was shown to be required for antibiotic production under conditions of nitrogen limitation (Chakraburtty and Bibb, 1997); moreover, induction of ppGpp synthesis at levels that did not influence growth rate and under conditions of nutritional sufficiency invoked the transcription of the pathway\u2010specific regulatory gene actII\u2010orf4 and actinorhodin production (Hesketh et\u2009al., 2001).", "Antibiotic production in actinomycetes is triggered frequently by nutrient limitation (Bibb, 2005; Mart\u00edn and Liras, 2012) presumably affording a selective advantage to the producing organism under starvation conditions.

The closest homologues of MibEF (with the exception of transporters encoded by closely related actinobacterial lantibiotic gene clusters, such as that for planosporicin; Sherwood and Bibb, 2013) are the immunity ABC transporters found in low\u2010GC Gram\u2010positive lantibiotic producers. This raises the intriguing possibility of the existence, at least for microbisporicin, of a fail\u2010safe mechanism that ensures that the production of a potent antibiotic does not take place unless the corresponding immunity system is in place. How this potential mechanism influences the expression of mibR and/or mibX and hence, microbisporicin biosynthesis remains to be determined.", "Preclinical trials suggest that microbisporicin is a promising candidate for clinical development, which will require the provision of significant amounts of the purified compound. In addition to deciphering the complex regulatory mechanism that triggers microbisporicin production, we have demonstrated, by constitutively expressing the genes encoding the two transcriptional activators present in the mib gene cluster, how that knowledge can be used to markedly increase the productivity of the wild\u2010type strain, hopefully contributing to the future clinical use of this compound.", "Preclinical trials suggest that microbisporicin is a promising candidate for clinical development, which will require the provision of significant amounts of the purified compound.

Another portion was used for cloning into pGEM\u2010TEasy (Promega UK, Southampton, UK) and the cloned PCR fragment sequenced using RACE_mibR_R2 as primer (RACE2 in Fig. S1B).", "Induction of microbisporicin production in M\n.\u2009corallina", "Induction of microbisporicin production in M\n.\u2009corallina", "Induction of microbisporicin production in M\n.\u2009corallina", "To test for induction of microbisporicin production in wild\u2010type M.\u2009corallina, either M.\u2009corallina M1592 (mibR expression strain) or 2.5\u2009\u03bcg of purified microbisporicin (in 10% DMSO) dried on a filter paper disc were placed on V0.1 (Marcone et\u2009al., 2010) agar plates adjacent to streaks of wild\u2010type M.\u2009corallina and a non\u2010producing mutant [\u0394mibA, (Foulston and Bibb, 2010)\u2009] as a control; the plates were overlaid with Micrococcus luteus after incubation at 30\u00b0C for 5 days.", "To test for induction of microbisporicin production in wild\u2010type M.\u2009corallina, either M.\u2009corallina M1592 (mibR expression strain) or 2.5\u2009\u03bcg of purified microbisporicin (in 10% DMSO) dried on a filter paper disc were placed on V0.1 (Marcone et\u2009al., 2010) agar plates adjacent to streaks of wild\u2010type M.\u2009corallina and a non\u2010producing mutant [\u0394mibA, (Foulston and Bibb, 2010)\u2009] as a control; the plates were overlaid with Micrococcus luteus after incubation at 30\u00b0C for 5 days.", "To test for induction of microbisporicin production in wild\u2010type M.\u2009corallina, either M.\u2009corallina M1592 (mibR expression strain) or 2.5\u2009\u03bcg of purified microbisporicin (in 10% DMSO) dried on a filter paper disc were placed on V0.1 (Marcone et\u2009al., 2010) agar plates adjacent to streaks of wild\u2010type M.\u2009corallina and a non\u2010producing mutant [\u0394mibA, (Foulston and Bibb, 2010)\u2009] as a control; the plates were overlaid with Micrococcus luteus after incubation at 30\u00b0C for 5 days.", "Supporting information", "Supporting information", "Supporting information", "Supporting information", "Click here for additional data file.", "Click here for additional data file.", "Acknowledgements", "This work was supported financially by grants from the European Commission (LAPTOP\u2010project, contract number 245066 for FP7\u2010KBBE\u20102009\u20103) and the UK Biotechnological and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [Institute Strategic Programme Grant \u2018Understanding and Exploiting Plant and Microbial Secondary Metabolism\u2019 (BB/J004561/1)\u2009].
