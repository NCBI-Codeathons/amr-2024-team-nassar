["In vitro experiments have indicated prebiotic activity of isomaltulose, which stimulates the growth of probiotics and the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). However, the absence of in vivo trials undermines these results. This study aims to investigate the effect of isomaltulose on composition and functionality of gut microbiota in rats. Twelve Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were divided into two groups: the IsoMTL group was given free access to water containing 10% isomaltulose (w/w), and the control group was treated with normal water for five weeks. Moreover, 16S rRNA sequencing showed that ingestion of isomaltulose increased the abundances of beneficial microbiota, such as Faecalibacterium and Phascolarctobacterium, and decreased levels of pathogens, including Shuttleworthia. Bacterial functional prediction showed that isomaltulose affected gut microbial functionalities, including secondary bile acid biosynthesis. Targeted metabolomics demonstrated that isomaltulose supplementation enhanced cholic acid concentration, and reduced levels of lithocholic acid, deoxycholic acid, dehydrocholic acid, and hyodeoxycholic acid. Moreover, the concentrations of propionate and butyrate were elevated in the rats administered with isomaltulose. This work suggests that isomaltulose modulates gut microbiota and the production of SCFAs and secondary bile acids in rats, which provides a scientific basis on the use of isomaltulose as a prebiotic.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Gut microbiota plays an important role in the host diet, nutrient production and absorption, metabolism, and maintenance of the immune system [1]. A large quantity of evidence has demonstrated that dysbiosis of intestinal bacteria is closely related to several diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular disease and celiac disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus [2,3,4,5]. It is, thereby, a crucial strategy to improve host wellness is the maintenance of gut microbial homeostasis. Prebiotics are effective microbiota-management tool; a prebiotic is described as a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit [6,7]. Inulin, galactooligosaccharides (GOS) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are the most prevalently used commercial prebiotic ingredients worldwide. These prebiotics have exhibited crucial efficiency in counteracting diseases [8,9]. For one, prebiotics can be utilized by beneficial microbiota and support their growth in the intestine [7]. The latter forcefully competes for nutrients and adhesion sites with opportunistic pathogens [10]. In addition, beneficial microorganisms may interact with host cells, which contributes to the intestinal barrier and immune functions [9].", "Gut microbiota plays an important role in the host diet, nutrient production and absorption, metabolism, and maintenance of the immune system [1].

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, are an extremely important class of these metabolites. SCFAs play a crucial role in the maintenance of the host\u2013gut homeostasis and health status. The mechanisms underlying SCFAs may be: (a) SCFAs decrease inflammatory responses, modulate the immune system, and induce apoptosis of cancer cells; (b) SCFAs, in turn, regulate gut microbial composition by inhibiting the conditioned-pathogen growth; (c) emerging research shows that SCFAs may promote the gut\u2013brain communication, which thereby affects multiple neurochemical pathways [2]. Another important type of metabolites are secondary bile acids (SBAs) from the conversion of primary bile acids by gut microbiota. An increasing number of studies show that SBAs may exhibit diverse roles in host physiology [12]. In particular, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) have demonstrated to suppress the proliferation of Clostridium difficile, induce hepatocellular carcinogenesis, and regulate metabolic and immune responses [13]. Moreover, DCA and LCA can be further modified into additional SBAs by intestinal microbiota, i.e., hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA). HDCA is suspected to have high cytotoxicity and anaphylactic roles [14,15,16].

Isomaltulose naturally occurs in honey and sugar cane juice [19]. Due to that, it exhibits many excellent properties, including similar organoleptic quality and processability to sucrose, low glycemic index, and non-cariogenicity; isomaltulose has been extensively used as sugar alternative in the food industry [20]. In our previous study, isomaltulose promoted the proliferation of selected probiotics [21]. Moreover, it affected the production of SCFAs in coculture with specific probiotic strains. Another in vitro human colonic model research demonstrated that isomaltulose reduced the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the level of acetic and butyric acids [22]. Therefore, these in vitro experiments exhibit that isomaltulose may have prebiotic activity. However, there is a substantial difference in intestinal microbial composition between in vitro and in vivo experiments. The present study aimed to explore the modulation effect of isomaltulose on gut microbiota in rats. In addition, we investigated changes in the production of SCFAs and SBAs by dietary isomaltulose.

At the phylum level, the consumption of isomaltulose elevated the abundance of Actinobacteria, whereas reduced the level of bacterial phyla Patescibacteria (Figure 5). Actinobacteria is one of the four predominant intestinal bacterial phyla, which mainly includes three anaerobe genera Bifidobacteria, Propionibacteria, Corynebacteria, and aerobe genera Streptomyces. Previous studies have demonstrated that the phyla Actinobacteria, especially Bifidobacteria, can produce the glycosyl hydrolases, and hydrolyze the glycosidic bond within disaccharides and polysaccharides, such as FOS, GOS, XOS, inulin, and arabinoxylans [33,34,35]. By which, the species from Actinobacteria are supported to grow and proliferate. Isomaltulose is a naturally occurred disaccharide comprised of glucose and fructose linked by alpha-1,6 glycosidic bond. It can thus be hydrolyzed and utilized by Actinobacteria microbiota. Moreover, the species from Actinobacteria, i.e., Bifidobacteria, also metabolizes carbohydrates into SCFAs, mainly including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid [36]. SCFAs, besides as the primary energy sources for gut epithelial cells, contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, barrier, immunology and host metabolism [36]. In addition, Streptomyces and other filamentous Actinobacteria have anti-tumor effects by producing antibiotics and thus damaging the DNA structure and functions of various tumor cells [37]. The decreased phyla Patescibacteria is likely an opportunistic or saprophytic colonizer. A previous study showed that Patescibacteria was significantly enriched in the group with alcoholic liver disease compared to the control, treatment, and positive groups [38]. Another research study also reported that the abundance of Patescibacteria was elevated in the signet-ring cell carcinoma patients [39].", "To further identify the specific effects of isomaltulose on microbial species, we performed the LEfSe analysis based on the 16S rRNA sequencing data from phylum to genus.

Among these microbes, the genera Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Phascolarctobacterium, Collinsella, UBA1819, Flavonifractor, and Holdemania were significantly enriched in the IsoMTL group. The elevated genera Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Phascolarctobacterium, and Flavonifractor are the butyrate-producing bacteria, thus indicating that the consumption of isomaltulose could increase the concentration of butyrate [40,41,42]. This was confirmed by our targeted quantitative analysis of SCFAs, where the level of butyric acid showed a significant improvement in the rats fed with isomaltulose when compared to the control rats (p < 0.05, Figure 9). Butyrate has a crucial effect on host physiology and wellness. In addition to providing energy for the colonocytes, butyrate can suppress NF-\u03baB transcription factor activation and interferon gamma and upregulate PPAR\u03b3, which thus withstand colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases [43,44,45,46,47]. Besides, the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii from the genera Faecalibacterium has been also demonstrated to increase the tight junction protein expression, which, thus, affects paracellular permeability and maintains gut barrier function [48,49]. Succinate is a crucial substrate for the proliferation of Clostridioides difficile, which causes severe diarrhea. A recent study demonstrated that the Phascolarctobacterium species completely consumed succinate and thus inhibited the growth of C. difficile [50]. The species Flavonifractor plautii is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium from the genera Flavonifractor belonging to Firmicutes. An animal experiment demonstrated that oral intervention of Flavonifractor plautii ameliorated antigen-induced Th2 immune responses and allergy by inhibiting interleukin-4 and IgE production and augmenting CD4+CD25+ T cells and CD103+CD11c+ DCs [51]. Another in vitro and in vivo study showed that the viable and heat-killed Flavonifractor plautii reduced inflammatory responses by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 [52]. It is well known that isomaltulose has a tooth-friendly property. The mechanisms may be the structure of isomaltulose comprising glucose and fructose monomers linked by the stable \u03b1-1,6 glycosidic bond, which prevent the fermentation and acid production by oral bacteria [53]. Shuttleworthia is the normal component of oral microbiome. Shuttleworthia satelles belonging to the genera Shuttleworthia was isolated from infected root canals of teeth with endodontic abscesses, and closely related to the occurrence and development of periodontal disease [54,55]. This may be supported by a recent clinical trial, where the species Shuttleworthia satelles was enriched in the preschool children with caries [56]. Therefore, we speculate that the consumption of isomaltulose prevents cavities likely through the inhabitation of the growth of oral Shuttleworthia satelles.

Conclusions", "In summary, the present study demonstrated that consumption of isomaltulose modulates the composition of gut microbiota, and the production of SCFAs and SBAs in rats. Beneficial microbes are enriched in the rats administered with isomaltulose, whereas opportunistic pathogens are suppressed. Moreover, isomaltulose ingestion notably affects functionalities of gut microbiota, including the elevation of alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, SBA biosynthesis, and the inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism. In accordance with the results of gut microbiota, isomaltulose supplementation enhances the concentration of CA, and reduces the levels of DCA, LCA, DHCA, and HDCA. Moreover, the concentrations of propionate and butyrate are significantly improved in the rats consuming isomaltulose. Therefore, this work suggests the modulation of isomaltulose on gut microbiota, and may provide a theoretical basis for its use in improving host health as a prebiotic.", "In summary, the present study demonstrated that consumption of isomaltulose modulates the composition of gut microbiota, and the production of SCFAs and SBAs in rats.

In accordance with the results of gut microbiota, isomaltulose supplementation enhances the concentration of CA, and reduces the levels of DCA, LCA, DHCA, and HDCA. Moreover, the concentrations of propionate and butyrate are significantly improved in the rats consuming isomaltulose. Therefore, this work suggests the modulation of isomaltulose on gut microbiota, and may provide a theoretical basis for its use in improving host health as a prebiotic.", "Acknowledgments", "We thank Zengmei Xu and Xiao Zhang for the support in SBAs and SCFAs profiling.", "Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "Supplementary Materials", "The following are available online.
