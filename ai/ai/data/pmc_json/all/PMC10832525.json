["Abstract", "Pseudomonas species have become promising cell factories for the production of natural products due to their inherent robustness. Although these bacteria have naturally evolved strategies to cope with different kinds of stress, many biotechnological applications benefit from engineering of optimised chassis strains with specially adapted tolerance traits. Here, we explored the formation of outer membrane vesicles (OMV) of Pseudomonas putida KT2440. We found OMV production to correlate with the recombinant production of a natural compound with versatile beneficial properties, the tripyrrole prodigiosin. Further, several P.\u2009putida genes were identified, whose up\u2010 or down\u2010regulated expression allowed controlling OMV formation. Finally, genetically triggering vesiculation in production strains of the different alkaloids prodigiosin, violacein, and phenazine\u20101\u2010carboxylic acid, as well as the carotenoid zeaxanthin, resulted in up to three\u2010fold increased product yields. Consequently, our findings suggest that the construction of robust strains by genetic manipulation of OMV formation might be developed into a useful tool which may contribute to improving limited biotechnological applications.", "The study explores the formation of outer membrane vesicles of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as support mechanism for natural compound production. We first show that vesiculation and recombinant valuable compound production are correlated. We further genetically engineer P. putida for enhanced vesiculation which facilitated increased production levels of a range of natural products. Our findings suggest that this approach may provide a tool for improving hitherto limited biotechnological applications.", "Bitzenhofer, N.L.\n, \nH\u00f6fel, C.\n, \nThies, S.\n, \nWeiler, A.J.\n, \nEberlein, C.\n, \nHeipieper, H.J.\n et al.

It is thus intriguing to understand how bacteria have naturally evolved different strategies to respond and adapt to chemical stress. In Pseudomonads, an active extrusion of a chemical stressor via efflux transporters to avoid its intracellular accumulation or damage recovery/prevention mechanisms (e.g., the use of chaperones or redox enzymes) are prominent strategies to deal with chemical stress (Bitzenhofer et al.,\u00a02021; Blanco et al.,\u00a02016; B\u00f6sl et al.,\u00a02006; Hartl et al.,\u00a02011; Henderson et al.,\u00a02021; Nicolaou et al.,\u00a02010; Roca et al.,\u00a02008). Further, a Pseudomonas\u2010characteristic and quite unique stress response is the conversion of cis\u2010 unsaturated fatty acids (FA) of the inner membrane (IM) to their trans\u2010configuration by the cis\u2010trans\u2010isomerase (Cti) (Bitzenhofer et al.,\u00a02021; Heipieper et al.,\u00a02003; Tan et al.,\u00a02016). The Cti exerts an immediate response: The enzyme is described to be constitutively present in the periplasm and as soon as the membrane is sufficiently perturbed, it can access the cis\u2010unsaturated FA in the membrane phospholipid bilayer and isomerises them to the corresponding trans\u2010configuration (Mauger et al.,\u00a02021). Additionally, P. putida can also respond by vesiculation to chemical stresses, i.e., releasing outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) into the extracellular space. This can be caused by structural changes in the cell envelope (Juodeikis & Carding,\u00a02022). The two processes, cis\u2010trans\u2010isomerisation and OMV release, can be employed synchronously in response to the same stresses, but not obligatory so (Eberlein et al.,\u00a02018). The OMVs are mainly composed of phospholipids, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and proteins (Avila\u2010Calder\u00f3n et al.,\u00a02021). Their release can lead to a more hydrophobic bacterial cell surface and thus enhance biofilm formation, which in turn increases bacterial resistance to chemical stressors (Atashgahi et al.,\u00a02018; Baumgarten et al.,\u00a02012). In addition, vesiculation can help to bring and/or keep the stressors out of the cell (Eberlein et al.,\u00a02019; Mozaheb & Mingeot\u2010Leclercq,\u00a02020) and OMVs may serve as an extracellular reservoir for chemical compounds, effectively reducing the concentration in or surrounding the cell (Domr\u00f6se et al.,\u00a02015; Schwechheimer & Kuehn,\u00a02015). An association of OMV release with natural bacterial export of secondary metabolites has been proposed (Batista et al.,\u00a02020; Choi et al.,\u00a02020; Mashburn & Whiteley,\u00a02005; Tan et al.,\u00a02020).

We chose to focus on the characteristic membrane adaptation responses of Pseudomonas species to environmental stress (i.e., Cti activity and vesiculation), especially triggered by hydrophobic compounds. The established method to assess the activity of Cti relies on the determination of the ratio of trans\u2010 to cis\u2010unsaturated membrane FAs via GC\u2013MS using common protocols for extraction and derivatisation (Heipieper et al.,\u00a01995). One common method to indirectly detect OMV formation is the quantification of proteins in the vesicle fraction which can be obtained by ultracentrifugation of culture supernatants (Eberlein et al.,\u00a02019). Positive controls for both assays were derived from previous studies: P. putida KT2440 wild type was treated with 1\u2010octanol, which is known to trigger both Cti activity and vesiculation (Baumgarten et al.,\u00a02012; Eberlein et al.,\u00a02018, 2019; Heipieper et al.,\u00a01995), and with the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), a quorum sensing\u2010associated compound that is known to induce vesiculation (Mashburn\u2010Warren et al.,\u00a02009). In addition, we analysed the effect of the hydrophobic antimicrobial tripyrrole prodigiosin on the cell envelope stress response since P. putida KT2440 has been shown to be especially suitable for the production of this compound (Domr\u00f6se et al.,\u00a02015, 2019).
