["The formicamycin biosynthetic gene cluster encodes two groups of type 2 polyketide antibiotics: the formicamycins and their biosynthetic precursors the fasamycins, both of which have activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we report the formicapyridines which are encoded by the same gene cluster and are structurally and biosynthetically related to the fasamycins and formicamycins but comprise a rare pyridine moiety. These compounds are trace-level metabolites formed by derailment of the major biosynthetic pathway. Inspired by evolutionary logic we show that rational mutation of a single gene in the biosynthetic gene cluster encoding an antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase (ABM) superfamily protein leads to a significant increase both in total formicapyridine production and their enrichment relative to the fasamycins/formicamycins. Our observations broaden the polyketide biosynthetic landscape and identify a non-catalytic role for ABM superfamily proteins in type II polyketide synthase assemblages for maintaining biosynthetic pathway fidelity.", "Formicapyridines are similar to pentacyclic fasamycin and formicamycin aromatic polyketides but with a pyridine moiety. Here the authors rationally mutate the biosynthetic gene cluster to increase production and identify a non-catalytic role for the ABM superfamily of proteins.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "An idealised linear biosynthetic pathway to a complex natural product can be imagined proceeding through a series of intermediate structures which would exist for some finite time as the pathway product accumulates. These hypothetical intermediates would exist freely in solution or bound to enzymes in the case of assembly line processes, and eventually all flux through the pathway would end and only the final product would exist. In reality no pathways proceed in this manner as the situation is complicated by varying rates of reaction for the different steps, meaning that some intermediates accumulate, while the inherent reactivity of other intermediates, or their ability to act as substrates for housekeeping enzymes not dedicated to the pathway, means that shunt metabolites often arise. Matters are further complicated by the fact that pathways are often convergent, with multiple units made in parallel before assembly into the final product, for example in the biosynthetic pathways to macrolide or aminoglycoside1 antibiotics. In addition, some pathways are not linear, and the final product is accessed via several routes due to the inherent substrate plasticity of the biosynthetic enzymes; well-studied examples include the rapamycin and erythromycin pathways2. Thus, in practice, any biosynthetic pathway will lead to the accumulation of a mixture comprising the final product plus varying concentrations of pathway intermediates and shunt metabolites. The composition of such a mixture will vary further when alternate growth conditions are used3.

We attempted to assign the absolute configuration by combining computational approaches with electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra as done for the fasamycins5. However, despite scaling up production to isolate additional 2, meaningful ECD spectra could not be obtained. Full characterization data for 1\u20136 are presented in Supplementary Note\u00a01. Due to the very low levels of 7\u20139, we have assigned preliminary structures based on 4\u20136, with a bromine atom replacing chlorine at C14.Fig. 3Structure determination. The COSY (black bold), NOESY (red double headed arrows) and HMBC (blue single headed arrows) correlations for formicapyridine B (2), along with the two resulting substructures are shown (Sub 1 and Sub 2)", "We first determined the structure of 2 which was isolated in the largest amount (~2\u2009mg). HRMS and 13C NMR data indicated a molecular formula of C28H25NO6 (calculated m/z 472.1755 ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+); observed m/z 472.1753 ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+); \u0394\u2009=\u2009\u22120.4\u2009ppm) indicating 17 degrees of unsaturation. The UV spectrum showed absorption maxima at 229, 249, 272 and 392\u2009nm indicating a complex conjugated system different to that of the fasamycins/formicamycins5. Inspection of the 13C NMR spectrum showed 21 sp2 carbons (\u03b4C 99.90\u2013167.54\u2009ppm), one carbonyl carbon (\u03b4C 191.81\u2009ppm), four methyl carbons (\u03b4C 20.41, 23.59, 34.56 and 37.75\u2009ppm), one methoxy carbon (\u03b4C 55.80\u2009ppm) and one sp3 quaternary carbon (\u03b4C 40.49\u2009ppm). The 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of five methyl singlets (\u03b4H 1.75, 1.76, 1.93, 3.67 and 3.81\u2009ppm), two aromatic proton singlets (\u03b4H 7.62 and 7.65\u2009ppm), plus four aromatic proton doublets (\u03b4H 6.24 (d, 2.25\u2009Hz), 6.70 (d, 2.25\u2009Hz), 6.34 (d, 2.27\u2009Hz) and 6.42 (d, 2.27\u2009Hz)). Limited 1H\u20131H COSY correlations meant we were reliant upon HMBC-based atomic connections, and through-space NOESY correlations, which led to two potential substructures consisting of 26 carbon atoms, leaving one carbonyl, one phenol and one quaternary carbon unassigned (Fig.\u00a03). This left some uncertainty, but given the relationship with the fasamycins, we predicted the structure to be that shown for 2. We thus plotted the 13C chemical shifts for 2 against those for fasamycin C (10), the closest structural congener. The data were in excellent agreement with the main differences at C7, C22 and C23, consistent with the adjacent nitrogen atom (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). With the structure of 2 in hand we readily assigned the structures of 1 and 3\u20136. NOESY correlations played a key role allowing us to link the methoxy group at C3 with H2 and H4 (e.g. 2, 3, 5 and 6), and the methoxy at C5 with H4 (e.g. 3 and 6). We also used NOESY and HSQC correlations to distinguish C14 and C16 once one was chlorinated: given the NOESY correlations to the gem-dimethyl groups of C26 and C27 with H16, and the disappearance of a HSQC linkage for C14, we concluded that C14 was chlorinated (e.g. 4\u20136).

Consistent with this, deletion of forS led to the isolation of shunt metabolite 13 with a C24-carboxyl group that was not observed from the WT. However, while ForS is implicated in ring-B cyclization it is not required for this role, nor, apparently, for the biosynthesis of any congeners. Rather, ForS seems to decrease the production of aberrant congeners from the pathway, e.g. formicapyridines, while increasing overall productivity. The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that another of the for BGC gene products is the actual catalyst for ring-B formation, and that ForS acts as a chaperone, which modulates or stabilises the assembly, or arrangement, of a multienzyme complex to optimise production of the fasamycins, and therefore ultimately the formicamycins. This has the consequence of minimising the production of shunt metabolites (formicapyridines). Thus, while deletion of forS leads to the phenotype desired from our thought experiment, the mechanism by which this occurs is not what was anticipated. Interpretation of the for BGC bioinformatic analysis suggests the most likely candidate for a ring-B (final) cyclase is ForL due to its close relationship with TcmI, which catalyses a similar final cyclization step during tetracenomycin biosynthesis19\u201321.

It also contains two ABM domain proteins (PdmH and PdmI; c.f. ForS and ForU) which were assigned monooxygenase roles. Through heterologous expression of PKS gene cassettes it was deduced that for the biosynthetic pathway to function correctly, and yield a pentangular backbone, all three cyclase genes (PdmDKL) plus the ABM domain monooxygenase PdmH must be co-expressed. In this pathway one oxidation reaction to form the quinone structure is required. These results led the authors to propose a model in which the two cyclases PdmKL and the monooxygenase PdmH form a multienzyme complex that engulfs the entire polyketide molecule during its assembly and work synergistically to ensure the correct reaction pathway occurs thereby minimising the production of shunt metabolites32. Similarly, formation of the unusual discoid metabolite resistomycin involves an extremely rare S-shaped folding pattern and requires the coordinated function, likely as a multienzyme complex, of core PKS proteins in addition to three distinct cyclase enzymes23.

Consistent with this, deletion of forS does not abolish polyketide production, but instead affects pathway productivity and fidelity. Thus, based on our mutational data and the observations discussed above, we hypothesise that ABM family enzymes can act as monooxygenases and/or as ancillary proteins to tune, in some way, the PKS enzyme complex function, and therefore the biosynthetic pathway, during aromatic polyketide biosynthesis. Genes encoding these proteins occur commonly in PKS BGCs, and multiple paralogues are often present even when monooxygenase reactions are not required. It is noteworthy that several PKS cyclases occur as fusion proteins with an ABM domain, which can be located at either terminus. We speculate that these may represent examples of mature pathways where the chaperone-like function of the ABM family protein has become essential, leading to selective pressure for the encoding gene to become transcriptionally fused with other cyclase encoding genes.", "Biosynthesis of the for BGC polyketide backbones does not require a monooxygenase.
