The RBP uses guanosine-5-triphosphate (GTP) and ribulose 5-phosphate as precursors for the biosynthesis of riboflavin. Generally, the RBP consists of five enzymes, GTP cyclohydrolase II (RibA), a bifunctional pyrimidine deaminase/reductase (RibD), 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate (3,4-DHBP) synthase (RibB), 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (lumazine) synthase (RibH) and riboflavin synthase (RibE) [1, 7, 8].

While some species arrange the full pathway genes in a single operon, others have the genes scattered in different transcriptional units along the chromosome.

Meanwhile, ribN expression was not affected. To determine if the negative regulatory effect of riboflavin on ribB depends on the activity of the RibN riboflavin importer, we constructed a ribN null mutant and assessed its ribB expression. Unexpectedly, the elimination of ribN caused a sevenfold increase in the expression of ribB when growing in the presence of riboflavin when compared to the WT without riboflavin (Fig.\u00a03). This overexpression is indeed dependent on extracellular riboflavin, as the expression of ribB in the \u2206ribN mutant is similar to that of the WT when no riboflavin is added to the medium. Moreover, the expression of ribB on the \u2206ribN is increased by 19 fold by the presence of riboflavin.

Although in this experiment the expression of ribD and ribA2 was somewhat reduced in the presence of riboflavin, this effect was not statistically significant. Meanwhile, ribN expression was not affected. To determine if the negative regulatory effect of riboflavin on ribB depends on the activity of the RibN riboflavin importer, we constructed a ribN null mutant and assessed its ribB expression. Unexpectedly, the elimination of ribN caused a sevenfold increase in the expression of ribB when growing in the presence of riboflavin when compared to the WT without riboflavin (Fig.\u00a03). This overexpression is indeed dependent on extracellular riboflavin, as the expression of ribB in the \u2206ribN mutant is similar to that of the WT when no riboflavin is added to the medium. Moreover, the expression of ribB on the \u2206ribN is increased by 19 fold by the presence of riboflavin. This overexpression was prevented by the complementation of the \u2206ribN strain with a plasmid encoding ribN (pBribNVch). In all cases, ribD expression remained around the same irrespective of the presence of riboflavin. These results show not only that RibN is necessary to repress ribB in response to riboflavin, but that extracellular riboflavin highly induces the expression of this gene when the RibN riboflavin importer is absent.Fig.\u00a02Relative expression of riboflavin supply pathways genes in V. cholerae growing in media with and without riboflavin.

The resulting product was cloned in the pGEM T Easy commercial cloning vector (Promega). Next, ribN was excised and subcloned into the PstI/XbaI sites of pBBR1 MCS 1 vector. This rendered the pBribNVch plasmid. The loss of expression of ribN transcript in the \u2206ribN strain as well as the rescue of expression by the pBribNVch plasmid were corroborated by end point RT-PCR with primers ribNFw and ribNRv (Additional file 4).", "Deletion of ribN in Vibrio cholerae was performed with homologous recombination using PCR products as reported before [46]. Briefly, WT strain was transformed with plasmid pKD46 encoding \u03bb phage Red recombinase system. Next, a PCR product containing a kanamycin resistant cassette flanked by sites homologous to ribN 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, using primers ribNH1P1and ribNH2P2 (Additional file 3) and plasmid pKD4 as template was obtained. The PCR product was electroporated into WT strain carrying pKD46, recombination system expression induced with arabinose and recombinants selected in LB+kanamycin plates. Positive clones were tested for the replacement of ribN by the kanamycin cassette by PCR using primers VCA1008FwHindIII and grxRv, flanking the insertion site. One of the positive clones was electroporated with plasmid pCP20, encoding FRT recombinase. After growth in nonselective LB media, clones were analyzed for the loss of the kanamycin cassette by testing antibiotic sensibility and PCR using primers VCA1008FwHindIII and grxRv. To construct a complementation plasmid with ribN, this gene was amplified from V. cholerae genomic DNA with PCR using primers VCA1008FwHindIII and ribNRvFLAGPstI. The resulting product was cloned in the pGEM T Easy commercial cloning vector (Promega). Next, ribN was excised and subcloned into the PstI/XbaI sites of pBBR1 MCS 1 vector. This rendered the pBribNVch plasmid.
