["Clinically relevant glycopeptide antibiotics remain among the most successful classes of natural antibacterials. This success, however, is endangered by the spread of glycopeptide resistance genes, also known as van genes. Thus, it is important to trace and comprehend possible routes of van gene dissemination. In the current work, we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis aimed at mapping the occurrence of van genes beyond the Actinobacteria phylum\u2014the most likely natural reservoir of van genes. We show that two additional classes of Gram-positive bacteria, Erysipelotrichia and Ktedonobacteria, as well as one class of Gram-negative bacteria, Anaerolineae, carry van genes. Additionally, we demonstrate that various new genera belonging to the classes Clostridia and Bacilli also carry van genes. The majority of discovered van loci are co-localized with MGE-related genes of various types. Finally, we propose a phylogeny-based scenario for the spread of van genes, unraveling a network of consequential horizontal gene transfer events linking the phylum Actinobacteria with the five other bacterial classes carrying van genes.", "1.

Introduction", "Glycopeptide antibiotics\u2014more precisely, dalbaheptides\u2014represent a large group of natural products produced by soil-dwelling, high-G-C-content, and Gram-positive actinomycetes [1,2].
