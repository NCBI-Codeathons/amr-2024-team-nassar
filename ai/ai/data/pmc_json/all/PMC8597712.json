["Covering: up to 2021", "Metagenomics has yielded massive amounts of sequencing data offering a glimpse into the biosynthetic potential of the uncultivated microbial majority. While genome-resolved information about microbial communities from nearly every environment on earth is now available, the ability to accurately predict biocatalytic functions directly from sequencing data remains challenging. Compared to primary metabolic pathways, enzymes involved in secondary metabolism often catalyze specialized reactions with diverse substrates, making these pathways rich resources for the discovery of new enzymology. To date, functional insights gained from studies on environmental DNA (eDNA) have largely relied on PCR- or activity-based screening of eDNA fragments cloned in fosmid or cosmid libraries. As an alternative, shotgun metagenomics holds underexplored potential for the discovery of new enzymes directly from eDNA by avoiding common biases introduced through PCR- or activity-guided functional metagenomics workflows. However, inferring new enzyme functions directly from eDNA is similar to searching for a \u2018needle in a haystack\u2019 without direct links between genotype and phenotype. The goal of this review is to provide a roadmap to navigate shotgun metagenomic sequencing data and identify new candidate biosynthetic enzymes. We cover both computational and experimental strategies to mine metagenomes and explore protein sequence space with a spotlight on natural product biosynthesis. Specifically, we compare in silico methods for enzyme discovery including phylogenetics, sequence similarity networks, genomic context, 3D structure-based approaches, and machine learning techniques. We also discuss various experimental strategies to test computational predictions including heterologous expression and screening. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the field with an emphasis on meta-omics, single-cell genomics, cell-free expression systems, and sequence-independent methods.", "Shotgun metagenomic approaches to uncover new enzymes are underdeveloped relative to PCR- or activity-based functional metagenomics.

There are also numerous genome context tools available for specific natural product classes. For example, RODEO142 and RiPPeR98 are useful to identify new RiPPs and maturases based on genomic context. Although RODEO is targeted towards RiPPs, it is not restricted to them and can be used generally to rapidly pull genome neighborhoods for any set of query sequences from public databases. Flanking genes are provided in tabular format for downstream PFAM co-occurrence analysis, phylogenetics, and SSN generation.", "Gene context is an often underemphasized but highly effective method for enzyme discovery especially for natural product biosynthesis. Flanking genes can often provide insights into substrates, cofactors, and natural product bioactivity. For example, a new family of cobamide-remodeling enzymes widespread in the human gut microbiome was identified based on genome context analysis of a coding sequence of unknown function flanked by cobamide biosynthesis and salvaging genes.139 To automate genome neighborhood analysis, a widely used addition to the EFI-EST is the Genome Neighborhood Tool (GNT).140 EFI-GNT generates genome neighborhood networks and allows for rapid visual assessment of genome context. It also conducts statistical analysis of gene co-occurrence to identify possible functional linkages. For natural product BGCs we also recommend specific tools such as BiG-SLICE141 and BiG-SCAPE128 designed to identify and group BGCs into gene cluster families. BiG-SCAPE is integrated with CORASON (Section 3.2), thus combining the power of phylogenetics with neighborhood clustering methods. BiG-SLICE is specifically designed to handle massive numbers of BGCs by representing them in Euclidean space rather than by pairwise comparison.141 This dramatically cut runtime to enable clustering of over one million BGCs from metagenome-assembled genomes.
