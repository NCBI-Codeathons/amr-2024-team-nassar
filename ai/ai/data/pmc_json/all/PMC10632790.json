["Abstract", "The zeamines produced by Dickeya oryzae are potent polyamine antibiotics and phytotoxins that are essential for bacterial virulence. We recently showed that the RND efflux pump DesABC in D. oryzae confers partial resistance to zeamines. To fully elucidate the bacterial self\u2010protection mechanisms, in this study we used transposon mutagenesis to identify the genes encoding proteins involved in zeamine resistance in D. oryzae EC1. This led to the identification of a seven\u2010gene operon, arn\nEC1, that encodes enzyme homologues associated with lipopolysaccharide modification. Deletion of the arn\nEC1 genes in strain EC1 compromised its zeamine resistance 8\u2010 to 16\u2010fold. Further deletion of the des gene in the arn\nEC1 mutant background reduced zeamine resistance to a level similar to that of the zeamine\u2010sensitive Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1. Intriguingly, the arn\nEC1 mutants showed varied bacterial virulence on rice, potato, and Chinese cabbage. Further analyses demonstrated that ArnBCATEC1 are involved in maintenance of the bacterial nonmucoid morphotype by repressing the expression of capsular polysaccharide genes and that ArnBEC1 is a bacterial virulence determinant, influencing transcriptional expression of over 650 genes and playing a key role in modulating bacterial motility and virulence. Taken together, these findings decipher a novel zeamine resistance mechanism in D. oryzae and document new roles of the Arn enzymes in modulation of bacterial physiology and virulence.", "The arn\nEC1 genes play multiple roles in bacterial physiology and virulence in Dickeya oryzae.", "Liang, Z.\n, \nHuang, L.\n, \nLiu, H.\n, \nZheng, Y.\n, \nFeng, J.\n, \nShi, Z.\n et al.

The diseases caused by D. oryzae pose a great threat to rice production in Asian and European countries and potato production in Australia (Bertani et al.,\u00a02013; Liu et al.,\u00a02013; Pritchard et al.,\u00a02013). Unlike most Dickeya species, which infect only dicot plants, D. oryzae is capable of infecting both monocot and dicot plants (Hussain et al.,\u00a02008). Similar to the well\u2010studied Dickeya dadantii (Reverchon & Nasser,\u00a02013), D. oryzae produces various cell wall\u2010degrading enzymes that contribute to its virulence and pathogenesis (Lv et al.,\u00a02018; Reverchon & Nasser,\u00a02013; Zhou et al.,\u00a02016). In addition, our recent studies unveiled two key virulence determinants in D. oryzae, that is, bacterial motility and the group of zeamine phytotoxins. Mutants defective in cell motility are severely compromised in rice seed invasion and systemic infection (Chen et al.,\u00a02020, 2022; Hussain et al.,\u00a02008; Lv et al.,\u00a02018, 2022; Shi et al.,\u00a02019; Zhou et al.,\u00a02016). Zeamines are a group of structurally related polyamine compounds produced by D. oryzae, which are phytotoxins that inhibit rice seed germination and damage plant tissues (Cheng et al.,\u00a02013; Zhou et al.,\u00a02011). Inactivation of zmsA, a key gene required for zeamine biosynthesis, drastically reduces the virulence of D. oryzae EC1 against rice, Chinese cabbage, and potato (Zhou et al.,\u00a02011).", "Dickeya oryzae is a gram\u2010negative bacterial plant pathogen, recently separated from Dickeya zeae (Wang et al.,\u00a02020).

Zeamines inhibit bacterial growth by damaging the cell envelope of gram\u2010negative bacteria in a way similar to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) (Masschelein, Clauwers, Stalmans et al.,\u00a02015). As a producer of zeamines, self\u2010protection mechanisms against these polyamine antimicrobials are of vital importance for the survival and growth of D. oryzae, with which the pathogen could tolerate a several\u2010hundred\u2010fold higher dose of zeamines than zeamine\u2010sensitive bacterial species such as Escherichia coli (Liang et al.,\u00a02019; Wu et al.,\u00a02010). We found recently that zeamines could induce the expression of the desAB genes, which encode components of the zeamine\u2010specific RND (RND refers to resistance, nodulation, and cell division) efflux pump DesABC (Liang et al.,\u00a02019). However, given that the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of zeamines for D. oryzae EC1 was more than 500\u2010fold higher than that for the zeamine\u2010sensitive strain E. coli DH5\u03b1, but only 8\u2010 to 32\u2010fold higher than those for the desABC gene mutants, we hypothesized that DesABC might not represent the sole zeamine resistance mechanism in D. oryzae (Liang et al.,\u00a02019).", "In addition to their role as phytotoxins, zeamines are also potent antimicrobial agents with broad\u2010spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and oomycetes (Hellberg et al.,\u00a02015; Liao et al.,\u00a02015; Masschelein, Clauwers, Awodi, et al.,\u00a02015; Wu et al.,\u00a02010).

As addition of l\u2010Ara4N creates a positively charged LPS that could minimize the binding of CAMPs, the Arn LPS modification system thus becomes an important bacterial resistance mechanism against CAMPs such as polymyxins (Gunn et al.,\u00a02000; Poirel et al.,\u00a02017). It was also noted that inactivation of the arn genes could weaken bacterial virulence, which was believed to be due to poor survival of the arn mutants in the presence of antimicrobial peptides from host organisms (Costechareyre et al.,\u00a02013; Gunn et al.,\u00a02000).", "The arn (arnBCADTEF) or pmr (pmrHFIJKLM) operon is widely conserved in gram\u2010negative bacterial species, including the pathogenic strains belonging to Salmonella enterica (Gunn et al.,\u00a02000), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (McPhee et al.,\u00a02003), Yersinia pestis (Winfield et al.,\u00a02005), Proteus mirabilis (Jiang et al.,\u00a02010), Serratia marcescens (Lin et al.,\u00a02014), Proteus vulgaris (Baron et al.,\u00a02018), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Cheung et al.,\u00a02020), and D. dadantii (Costechareyre et al.,\u00a02013).

The undecaprenyl phosphate\u2010\u03b1\u2010l\u2010Ara4N may be transported from the inner membrane to the outer membrane by two l\u2010Ara4N\u2010phosphoundecaprenol flippase subunits, ArnE and ArnF. At the last step, an undecaprenyl phosphate\u2010\u03b1\u20104\u2010amino\u20104\u2010deoxy\u2010l\u2010arabinose arabinosyl transferase encoded by arnT transfers l\u2010Ara4N from undecaprenyl phosphate\u2010\u03b1\u2010l\u2010Ara4N to lipid A (Breazeale et al.,\u00a02005; Trent et al.,\u00a02001; Yan et al.,\u00a02007). Bioinformatics analysis showed that the ArnEC1 enzymes are highly similar to the well\u2010characterized Arn homologues in S. enterica, P. aeruginosa, and D. dadantii with an amino acid similarity of over 57% (Table\u00a01) and proposed conserved functions. MIC assay results unveiled the involvement of arn\nEC1 genes in Dickeya tolerance against zeamines and polymyxin B (Table\u00a01). Similar to polymyxin B, zeamines also contain positive charged amino groups and act by damaging the cell envelope of gram\u2010negative bacteria (Masschelein, Clauwers, Stalmans, et al.,\u00a02015), implying that addition of the l\u2010Ara4N moiety in LPS by the ArnEC1 system could reduce the chance of zeamines damaging the bacterial cell membrane. In addition, we found that the ArnEC1 system plays an essential role in D. oryzae biofilm formation, which is a well\u2010established antimicrobial and stress tolerance mechanism (Flemming et al.,\u00a02016). A previous study showed that inactivation of an arnA\nEC1 homologue, pmrI, led to partially decreased biofilm formation in P. mirabilis (Jiang et al.,\u00a02010). In the present study, we found that biofilm formation in the arn\nEC1 deletion mutants of D. oryzae was almost completely abolished (Figure\u00a04b). Previous studies underlined the positive contributions of LPS to two key steps of biofilm formation, namely, bacterial initial attachment and adhesion to the abiotic surface (Ruhal & Kataria,\u00a02021), and a general negative impact of CPS overproduction on biofilm formation (Limoli et al.,\u00a02015). As inactivation of the cps1 gene did not restore biofilm formation in arn\nEC1 mutants, we proposed the complete abolishment of biofilm formation resulted from the negative impact of LPS changes after inactivation of arn\nEC1 genes, but not a general negative influence of CPS overproduction caused by inactivation of arn\nEC1 genes. Taken together, we conclude that the ArnEC1 system confers zeamine and CAMP resistance through modification of LPS and facilitation of biofilm formation in D. oryzae EC1.", "The arn operon is known for its role in bacterial resistance against CAMPs such as polymyxin B (Gunn et al.,\u00a02000; Jiang et al.,\u00a02010; Lin et al.,\u00a02014; McPhee et al.,\u00a02003; Winfield et al.,\u00a02005). The operon contains seven genes encoding the enzymes for modification of bacterial outer membrane LPS with the cationic l\u2010Ara4N moiety, which reduces the net negative charge of LPS and limits the binding, accumulation, and permeation of CAMPs (Yan et al.,\u00a02007). Among these seven genes, arnA encodes a decarboxylase/UDP\u20104\u2010amino\u20104\u2010deoxy\u2010l\u2010arabinose formyltransferase catalysing the first reaction step for the biosynthesis of UDP\u20104\u2010ketopentose from UDP\u2010glucuronic acid. A UDP\u20104\u2010amino\u20104\u2010deoxy\u2010l\u2010arabinose\u2010oxoglutarate aminotransferase encoded by arnB converts UDP\u20104\u2010ketopentose to UDP\u2010\u03b2\u2010l\u2010Ara4N at the second reaction step.

Taken together, we conclude that the ArnEC1 system confers zeamine and CAMP resistance through modification of LPS and facilitation of biofilm formation in D. oryzae EC1.", "We recently reported that the RND efflux pump DesABC is involved in zeamine resistance (Liang et al.,\u00a02019). Interestingly, null mutation of the DesABC pump in D. oryzae EC1 causes an about eightfold decrease in zeamine resistance (Liang et al.,\u00a02019). In addition, transcriptional expression of desAB is inducible and triggered by exogenous addition of zeamines but not polymyxin B (Liang et al.,\u00a02019). In contrast, however, transcriptional expression of the arn\nEC1 genes appeared to be cell density\u2010dependent and was not affected by zeamines (Figure\u00a02a\u2013c), and deletion of arn\nEC1 genes caused a more severe loss of resistance to polymyxin B than to zeamines (Table\u00a01). These findings suggest that DesABC is a zeamine\u2010specific resistance mechanism, whereas ArnEC1 is more likely a broad\u2010spectrum resistance mechanism against various CAMPs produced by the hosts and the competitors of D. oryzae in the environment. Such high expression of the ArnEC1 system at the early bacterial growth stage may facilitate D. oryzae survival upon exposure to CAMPs from the hosts and in the presence of competitors of D. oryzae when zeamines are not highly produced and accumulated for competition in the environment. Importantly, we found that simultaneous knockdown of arnB\nEC1 and desB decreased the zeamine resistance of D. oryzae EC1 to a level similar to that of the zeamine\u2010sensitive E. coli DH5\u03b1 (Table\u00a01), indicating that the DesABC efflux pump and the ArnEC1 LPS modification system are the predominant self\u2010protection mechanisms of D. oryzae against its self\u2010produced toxic zeamines.", "We recently reported that the RND efflux pump DesABC is involved in zeamine resistance (Liang et al.,\u00a02019).

Transcriptomics analysis performed between the wild\u2010type strain EC1 and the arnB\nEC1 mutant not only suggested the bacterial growth and virulence conferred by ArnBEC1 are associated with the contribution of ArnBEC1 to the regulation of the expression of hundreds of genes in D. oryzae, especially those belonging to ribosome, carbon metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, but also unveiled the similarities and dissimilarities of ArnEC1 components in regulating biological functions. Firstly, ArnBCATEC1 have similar roles in conferring a nonmucoid phenotype through repressing CPS genes. Transcriptomics analysis results unveiled that inactivation of arnB\nEC1 resulted in overexpression of CPS genes (Table\u00a0S4), which subsequently led to the finding that ArnCATEC1 also influenced the conversion between mucoid and nonmucoid phenotypes through modulation of CPS gene expression (Figures\u00a04a, 7b, and S2). Notably, ArnDEC1 plays a dissimilar role in conferring the bacterial nonmucoid morphotype. Inactivation of arnD\nEC1 up\u2010regulated CPS gene expression (Figure\u00a07b), but this did not result in a mucoid phenotype as inactivation of the arnBCAT\nEC1 genes (Figure\u00a04). We proposed that in addition to a similar role in the regulation of CPS gene expression, ArnDEC1 may play additional roles in modulating metabolic pathways required for the biosynthesis of CPS components. This was evident as ArnDEC1 had a higher contribution to bacterial growth than other ArnEC1 components (Figure\u00a05a). Such multifaceted impact of ArnDEC1 on bacterial metabolism may lead to the difference between ArnDEC1 and other ArnEC1 components in regulating the conversion between mucoid and nonmucoid phenotypes. Secondly, it is intriguing to find that although ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have regulatory roles in bacterial growth and swimming motility, ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have distinct regulatory mechanisms. Transcriptomics analysis results unveiled that ArnBEC1 induces the expression of S10 ribosomal genes, whose counterparts in E. coli and B. subtilis are involved in bacterial growth, cell division, and swimming motility (Klitgaard et al.,\u00a02015; Suzuki et al.,\u00a02014; Takada et al.,\u00a02014; Zouine et al.,\u00a02000). However, unlike ArnBEC1, ArnDEC1 did not play a significant role in inducing the expression of S10 ribosomal genes and a process associated with ribosomal protein production, that is, RNA biosynthesis (Figure\u00a07d,e). We proposed these observations may result from the fact that ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have different substrate specificity, as ArnBEC1 is a proposed putative UDP\u20104\u2010amino\u20104\u2010deoxy\u2010l\u2010arabinose\u2010oxoglutarate aminotransferase, whereas ArnDEC1 is a proposed 4\u2010deoxy\u20104\u2010formamido\u2010l\u2010arabinose\u2010phosphoundecaprenol deformylase. Although the mechanisms of action of ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 are still unclear, studies of the biological functions of arnB\nEC1 and arnD\nEC1 mutants provided useful clues on how ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 affect the virulence of D. oryzae. The present study demonstrated the roles of ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 in the regulation of swimming motility and bacterial growth (Figure\u00a05). Bacterial motility is one of the key virulence determinants of D. oryzae that plays important roles in bacterial invasion and systemic infection (Chen et al.,\u00a02020, 2022; Hussain et al.,\u00a02008; Lv et al.,\u00a02018, 2022; Shi et al.,\u00a02019; Zhou et al.,\u00a02016). It seems rational that the larger contributions of ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 than other ArnEC1 components to D. oryzae virulence resulted from the positive regulation of swimming motility by ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1. Given that ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have different regulatory roles in cell division, expression of S10 ribosomal genes, and RNA synthesis (Figures\u00a06 and 7d,e), we proposed the contributions of ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 to D. oryzae virulence are redundant.", "In addition to validation of the role of the ArnEC1 LPS system in CAMP resistance and biofilm formation (Figure\u00a04b, Table\u00a01), which have been documented in other bacterial species as well (Gunn et al.,\u00a02000; Jiang et al.,\u00a02010), interestingly, the results from this study unveiled several new biological functions associated with the ArnEC1 system or its components.

For constructing complementation strains, each arn\nEC1 gene was cloned into the low\u2010copy plasmid pBBR1\u2010MCS4 and constitutively expressed under the control of the lac promoter in pBBR1\u2010MCS4. The resultant construct was transformed into the corresponding mutant and the desired strains were screened on MM agar plates with ampicillin and verified by PCR. Construction of the plasmid pAmob\u2010arnBCADTEF\nEC1 for heterologous expression of the arn\nEC1 operon in D. dandantii 3937 was performed following a previously described method (Fu et al.,\u00a02012).

The resultant construct pA\u2010arnBCADTEF\nEC1 was introduced with the mob region cloned from pBBR1\u2010MCS4 for DNA transfer. The plasmids pAmob\u2010arnBCADTEF\nEC1 and pBB\u2010ugd\nEC1 were cotransformed into D. dadantii 3937 for heterologous expression of arnBCADTEF\nEC1 and ugd\nEC1.", "Transposon mutagenesis analysis", "Transposon mutagenesis analysis", "Transposon mutagenesis analysis", "To identify the genes that are involved in zeamine resistance in D. oryzae EC1, the mutant \u2206zmsA was randomly mutated with the mariner\u2010based transposon carried by pBT20 (Seet & Zhang,\u00a02011) through biparental mating on YEB agar plates (10\u2009g/L tryptone, 5\u2009g/L yeast extract, 10\u2009g/L KCl, 10\u2009g/L sucrose, 0.5\u2009g/L MgSO4\u2e317H2O, 18\u2009g/L agar, pH\u20097.0).

For transcriptomics analysis, the libraries were prepared using the TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3\u2010cBot\u2010HS (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced using an Illumina Novaseq platform. Two biological replicates were applied in this assay. Data were aligned by Bowtie v. 2\u20102.2.3. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq R package (v. 1.18.0), and genes with log2[fold change] \u2265\u2009|1| and adjusted p value \u2264\u20090.05 (p\nadj\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) were considered as differentially expressed. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed by testing the statistical enrichment of differentially expressed genes using KOBAS software. For RT\u2010PCR analysis, the intergenic regions of arnBC\nEC1, arnCA\nEC1, arnAD\nEC1, arnDT\nEC1, arnTE\nEC1, and arnEF\nEC1 were amplified for different samples using 2\u00d7\u2009EasyTaq PCR SuperMix (+dye) (TransGen Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. RT\u2010qPCR analysis was performed following an established method (Liang et al.,\u00a02019) using a QuantStudio 6 Flex system and PowerUp SYBR green master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with the 16S rRNA gene serving as the endogenous reference. The RT\u2010qPCR conditions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, 95\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, and 40\u2009cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009s, 57\u00b0C for 15\u2009s, and 72\u00b0C for 30\u2009s.
