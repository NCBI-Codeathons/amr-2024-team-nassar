["Handling Editor: Jian-Kui Liu.", "Fungi are an understudied resource possessing huge potential for developing products that can greatly improve human well-being. In the current paper, we highlight some important discoveries and developments in applied mycology and interdisciplinary Life Science research. These examples concern recently introduced drugs for the treatment of infections and neurological diseases; application of \u2013OMICS techniques and genetic tools in medical mycology and the regulation of mycotoxin production; as well as some highlights of mushroom cultivaton in Asia. Examples for new diagnostic tools in medical mycology and the exploitation of new candidates for therapeutic drugs, are also given. In addition, two entries illustrating the latest developments in the use of fungi for biodegradation and fungal biomaterial production are provided. Some other areas where there have been and/or will be significant developments are also included.

The earliest human civilizations were founded because the people deliberately cultivated certain types of plants or bred certain types of animals and could thus create a sustainable source of food to support the foundation of larger cities (Ackerman et al. 2014; Raimi et al. 2021). Microscopic fungi, such as certain yeasts and \u201cmoulds\u201d have also been used for millennia for production of food and beverages, based on empirical knowledge, even though the early civilisations did not have any scientific background about fermentation processes that result in the production of, e.g., bread, beer, and wine (Hyde et al. 2019). Likewise, certain mushrooms were used traditionally as remedies to treat and cure various kinds of diseases (De Silva et al. 2012).

The strategy proved to be useful in preventing disease, such as type I diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast, the effectiveness of the approach on multiple sclerosis has been rather low, which may be attributed to the fact that the approach has less effect on the T-cells that were previously activated, with the costimulatory blockade being unable to suppress the cells (Rosenblum et al. 2014).", "Apart from synthetic medication, natural products also play a major role in the treatment and management of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Interestingly, Lloyd (1923) had already remarked that the type of Cordyceps/Isaria sinclarii was similar to \u201cCordyceps sobolifera\u201d, but this was never taken into account when the genera and families of the invertebrate-associated taxa were rearranged. We conclude that the information on the original producer strain of myriocin needs to be corrected to \u201cOphiocordyceps sp.\u201d, even though the species cannot be narrowed down with certainty because the stromata from which the ATCC culture was obtained are not apparently available for taxonomic revision. Studies are presently ongoing to verify whether the phylogenetically close strains to \u201cIsaria sinclairii ATCC 24,400\u201d are able to produce myriocin, so this riddle can be solved.Fig. 2Stromata of Ophiocordyceps khonkaenensis.

After phosphorylation, the active moiety fingolimod-P exerts its effects by mimicking sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and binds to four G protein-coupled sphingosine-1-phosphates receptors (GPCRs). Up till now, five S1P receptors termed S1P1-5 have been identified and fingolimod-P binds with similar affinity as S1P to S1P1, S1P3, S1P5 and shows much better binding to S1P4 than S1P. Unlike S1P fingolimod-P is not a ligand for S1P2 (Huwiler and Zangemeister-Wittke 2018).

Moreover, fingolimod was also reported to contribute to neuroprotection in the central nervous system as it can easily cross the blood\u2013brain-barrier (BBB) based on its high lipophilic nature and is thought to exert effects directly on resident central nervous system cells, which also express S1P receptors (Hunter et al. 2016).Fig. 3Mechanism of phosphorylation of sphingosine and fingolimod via sphingosine kinase 2 (Strader et al. 2011)", "Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator that is rapidly metabolized in vivo following phosphorylation by sphingosine Kinase 2 (SphK2) to produce the phosphorylated and active form of fingolimod-phosphate (Brinkmann 2009; Huwiler and Zangemeister-Wittke 2018) (Fig.\u00a03).

The risk of fungal infection is particularly high in those patients with low immunity response and also in patients whose treatment involves the use of artificial surfaces, such as plastic intravenous lines and cannulas (Poowanawittayakom et al. 2018). A current striking example of such \u201crisk groups\u201d are COVID-19-infected patients that are undergoing bronchoscopy (Bartoletti et al. 2020; Koehler et al. 2021). Some opportunistic pathogens may even overcome the immune system of healthy individuals and cause chronic or fatal infections. Cladophialophora bantiana, Talaromyces marneffei and Candida auris were chosen as examples of most feared opportunistic fungal pathogens responsible for increasing number of fatal infections in healthy individuals, particularly in a case of C. auris because of limited treatment options due to multidrug resistance (Hyde et al. 2018a). However, C. auris represents only one of many pathogens facing a threat of treatment failure due to more and more limited treatment options. Only three classes of antifungal drugs are currently available to treat invasive mycoses and one additional class is registered for treatment of non-systemic fungal infections (Walsh et al. 2008). Moreover, many of these pathogens have become resistant over time, including azole resistant Aspergillus, terbinafine resistant dermatophytes, fluconazole resistant Coccidioides, multidrug resistant strains of Candida, Lomentospora, Microascus, Scedosporium, and Scopulariopsis (Ebert et al. 2020; Du et al. 2020; Al-Hatmi et al. 2019; Mello et al. 2019; P\u00e9rez-Cantero and Guarro 2020). Thus, if the pathogens become resistant to one class, the therapeutic options are significantly reduced.

Cladophialophora bantiana, Talaromyces marneffei and Candida auris were chosen as examples of most feared opportunistic fungal pathogens responsible for increasing number of fatal infections in healthy individuals, particularly in a case of C. auris because of limited treatment options due to multidrug resistance (Hyde et al. 2018a). However, C. auris represents only one of many pathogens facing a threat of treatment failure due to more and more limited treatment options. Only three classes of antifungal drugs are currently available to treat invasive mycoses and one additional class is registered for treatment of non-systemic fungal infections (Walsh et al. 2008).

Conversely, H2A.Z deacetylation was shown to involve the Hda1 protein deacetylase (Mehta et al. 2010). High-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments in a number of model organisms have revealed that H2A.Z preferentially occupies nucleosomes that flank gene promoters and is particularly enriched at the\u2009+\u20091 nucleosome as well as at the \u2212\u00a01 and \u2212\u00a02 nucleosomes thereby flanking nucleosome-depleted regions at the transcriptional start sites (Talbert and Henikoff 2010).

(2019)", "Pathogenic fungal interactions with human tissues influence the establishment of fungal diseases (Tronchin et al. 2008). As the adhesion to the human tissues is important for disease initiation, understanding fungal interactions with the human is a prerequisite for controlling and treatment purposes. Many studies have employed CRISPR/Cas9 to study genes responsible for fungal virulence (Gauthier et al. 2012; Min et al. 2016, 2018; Lombardi et al. 2017; Shapiro et al. 2018; Umeyama et al. 2018; Ballard et al. 2019; Bruni et al. 2019). This system generates multiple, parallel, genome-wide mutations of targeted genes and tests their function in response to fungal diseases (Mans et al. 2015; Sharon et al. 2018). Most of these studies have been focused on understanding the interactions of major human pathogenic fungal lineages, such as Candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Mucorales (Vyas et al. 2015; Arras et al. 2016; Min et al. 2016, 2018; Wang et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016; Al Abdallah et al. 2017; Huang and Mitchell 2017; Lombardi et al. 2017; Nguyen et al. 2017; Nagy et al. 2017; Fan and Lin 2018; Shapiro et al. 2018; Umeyama et al. 2018; Ballard et al. 2019; Bruni et al. 2019; Wensing et al. 2019). They not only contributed to manipulate fungal pathogens, but also develop and assess different CRISPR/Cas9 delivery strategies, their transient or permanent expression systems, leading to the evolution of CRISPR/Cas9 technology (Table 1) (Vyas et al. 2015; Min et al. 2016, 2018; Arras et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016; Al Abdallah et al. 2017; Huang and Mitchell 2017; Lombardi et al. 2017; Nguyen et al. 2017; Nagy et al. 2017; Fan and Lin 2018; Shapiro et al. 2018; Umeyama et al. 2018; Ballard et al. 2019; Bruni et al. 2019; Wensing et al. 2019).

Further, CRISPR/Cas9 technology facilitates the insertion of corrective or protective mutations, such as in Haemophilia A (Park et al. 2015), Sickle-cell anaemia and \u03b2-thalassemia (Huang et al. 2015; Song et al. 2015). CRISPR/Cas9 has been efficiently used in different cell lines to disrupt viral DNA by inactivating the viral gene expression and replication of human immunodeficiency virus (Hu et al. 2014) and other viruses, such as hepatitis B (Lin et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2015a, b; Kennedy et al. 2015), and human papillomavirus (Zhen et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2015). Due to the rapid development, many studies and clinical trials adopt CRISPR/Cas9 system as a therapeutic strategy. In addition to these genetic diseases and disorders, CRISPR-based gene alteration therapeutic studies have been assessed against fungal diseases, such as deadly Cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii (Arras et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016; Fan and Lin 2018). Similar studies have been conducted to replace virulence genes in human pathogenic fungal species, such as the cyp51A gene in azole-resistant clinical Aspergillus fumigatus isolates (Umeyama et al. 2018), carB and hmgR2 genes of Mucor circinelloides (Nagy et al. 2017), and pyrf gene in clinical isolates of Rhizopus delemar (Bruni et al. 2019). Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 has been used in cancer and stem-cell research as a highly-specific and adaptable tool to correct mutations in cancer cell lines (Kim et al. 2017). In addition to being a therapeutic tool, the CRISPR/Cas9 has been assessed for developing anticancer drugs. For example, CRISPR-based studies conducted on Candida species facilitate the development of new antifungal drugs (Min et al. 2016, 2018; Lombardi et al. 2017; Shapiro et al. 2018; Halder et al. 2019) and have been used to discover drugs against Cryptococcus species (Nargesi et al. 2021).

There are growing concerns about the degradation of synthetic plastic, which initiated research focused on the use of materials from renewable resources such as fungal mycelium-based materials (Manan et al. 2021). Mycelium can be described as a network of interwoven, thread-like hyphae that constitute the vegetative part of fungi (Karana et al. 2018). Fungi decompose dead plant substrates by breaking down cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and other sugars into small molecules through the secretion of enzymes (Promputtha et al. 2010). The vegetative mycelium degrades and colonizes the organic substrate by using the products of degradation (Meyer et al. 2020a, b).

Mycelium-based materials are produced by growing vegetative fungal hyphae on different organic substrates through solid-state fermentation (Pelletier et al. 2013; Islam et al. 2018). The properties of mycelium-based materials depend on the fungal strain, the type of substrate, the growth conditions, and the post-synthesis process (Appels et al. 2018, 2019).

Several Ascomycota and Basidiomycota genera have been used in mycelium-based technology (Attias et al. 2020, Table 4). White-rot and brown-rot fungi have mainly been utilized in the generation of mycelium-based materials due to their high colonization rate and ability to degrade a large amount of organic biomass (Cerimi et al. 2019). Different hyphal types can influence the properties of mycelium-based materials, for example, monomitic fungal species can provide less effective mechanical properties than dimitic and trimitic fungal species (Pegler 1996; Bayer and McIntyre 2012, 2015).

Pure mycelium materials are harvested from liquid fermentation of fungi in static or machine-shaken containers (Karana et al. 2018). Filamentous fungi grown in static liquid culture form a mat of hyphae at the surface of the liquid and when dried the resulting material resembles leather, paper, or plastic (Karana et al. 2018). Many factors, such as light, humidity, temperature, and incubation period are important factors that can affect mycelium growth. Conditions of darkness are often preferred to prevent the formation of fruiting bodies and for rapid mycelium growth (Deacon 1980).", "Different fabrication processes result in different functional aspects of mycelium-based composite (Karana et al. 2018). The residual water present in the mycelium-based composite is commonly removed by drying in an oven to produce lightweight and high-strength materials (Jiang et al. 2017). Moreover, the pressing involved in the fabrication process can result in a reduction of the porosity of the materials, thus increasing the material density and strength (Haneef et al. 2017; Appels et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2019). Mechanical, physical, and biological properties of mycelium-based composites are affected by the substrate type, the mycelia network and the pressing method (Pegler 1996; Appels et al. 2019). The high compressive strength and lightweight of mycelium-based composites enable them to be used as packaging and construction materials (Yang et al. 2021). Moreover, the low density, low thermal conductivity, and high porous characteristics of mycelium-based composites make them suitable for the production of alternative synthetic foam and wood fibers (Manan et al. 2021). Therefore, a better understanding of the beneficial properties of mycelium-based composites is crucial for their potential applications in a variety of fields. Another advantage of mycelium-based composites is that they are non-toxic and biodegradable in nature (Cerimi et al. 2019; Girometta et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2021).

Several meat-like products have also been developed by companies such as Mycorena (A. oryzae), Sustainable Bioproducts (F. oxysporum) and MycoTechnology, using the basidiomycete Lentinula edodes (Meyer et al. 2020a).", "Fungi have been used as a source of food for humans throughout history (Hyde et al. 2019). The human consumption of fungi has predominantly involved mushrooms that originate from both natural habitats and cultivation processes (Chang 2006; Li et al. 2021; Perez-Moreno et al. 2021). The fruiting bodies of mushrooms can emerge in a variety of shapes, tastes and textures (Hyde et al. 2020b; Bhunjun et al. 2022). Some mushrooms have been described as being meat-like, such as beefsteak fungus (Fistulina hepatica) and chicken of the woods (Laetiporus sulphureus), as well as the seafood-like abalone fungus (Pleurotus cystidiosus) and the lobster mushroom (Lactarius and Russula parasitized by the ascomycete Hypomyces lactifluorum) (Rahi and Malik 2016). The dry matter of an edible mushroom is generally composed of protein (15\u201335%), carbohydrates (35\u201370%), essential fatty acids (less than 5%), as well as traces of vitamins and minerals (Barros et al. 2008; Valverde et al. 2015; Niego et al. 2021a). They are also known to have antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, and immunomodulatory properties (De Silva et al. 2012; Kaewnarin et al. 2016, 2020; Valverde et al. 2015; Hyde et al. 2019). Traditionally, fungal mycelia have only been used as flavor and color modifiers in fermented foods such as blue cheese, red mold rice, soy sauce and tempeh (Hyde et al. 2019; Ahmad et al. 2020). However, meat-like products or mycoproteins have been produced from fungal mycelium via liquid fermentation process (Moore and Chiu 2001).

Mycoprotein products from fungal mycelia are also available in the form of a bacon substitute by Atlast Food Co. under the trade name MyBacon\u2122 (Meyer et al. 2020a). Mycoprotein is a widely accepted food and is approved for sale in all EU counties, as well as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the USA (Derbyshire 2020). It has recently been approved for sale in Thailand (Derbyshire 2020). Mycoprotein is considered a good source of high-quality proteins as it contains a higher percentage of essential amino acids (approximately 45%) than most other commonly consumed plant-based proteins (approximately 25%) (Finnigan et al. 2019). The consumption of mycoproteins can lead to the generation of slower and more sustained essential amino acids and branched chain amino acid levels when compared to milk (Finnigan et al. 2019; Dunlop et al. 2017). Moreover, the high bioavailability and amino acid composition of mycoproteins can stimulate a greater rate of muscle protein synthesis compared to milk protein in healthy young men (Dunlop et al. 2017). Subsequently, mycoproteins show great promise as a source of dietary protein that has the potential to support skeletal muscle protein metabolism (Coelho et al. 2021; Monteyne et al. 2020). Several studies have reported that mycoprotein consumption can change blood lipid levels by reducing plasma cholesterol and improving high-density lipoproteins (Turnbull et al. 1992; Ishikawa 1994; Ruxton and McMilan 2010; Coelho et al. 2021). Mycoprotein consumption is also associated with reduced insulin levels, sustained hyperinsulinaemia and hyperaminoacidaemia, improved immune function, reduced tumour-associated symptoms and extended survival rates in lung cancer patients (Turnbull and Ward 1995; Bottin et al. 2012; Fritz et al. 2015; Cherta-Murillo et al. 2020).", "Mycoprotein products are available in different forms, for example beef burgers, beef steaks, chicken nuggets, fish sticks, meatballs, sausages, among others (Joshi and Kumar 2015).

For land-filled plastics, the absence of UV light (for photodecomposition) and oxygen (for biodegradation) results in persistence for centuries or longer (Glaser 2019). About 3% of plastic wastes escape to oceans (Jambeck et al. 2015).", "Potential environmental damage from discarded synthetic plastic polymers have been examined for marine and terrestrial environments (e.g., Bergmann et al. 2015; Pawar et al. 2016; Iqbal et al. 2020; Rillig and Lehmann 2020; Rillig et al. 2021).

Advances made from these data mainly include phylogenomics for taxonomic organization, designing effective therapies against targeted fungal pathogens, and the development of new antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and secondary metabolites necessary for industrial applications, among many others. The use of whole-genomes in phylogenomic studies provides sufficient data to elucidate relationships deeper in geological time, as well as to resolve relationships that evolved in short divergence times, which may lead to resolve problems in taxonomy (James et al. 2020). Further studies on these whole-genome sequences allow to perform functional genomic studies on the genes predicted from the whole genome sequences, thus providing new knowledge to predict their lifestyles (G\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez and Kemen 2021). The availability of genomic data also enables to assess micro- and macro variations within a species in a population to determine their genomic evolution. Furthermore, mining whole-genome sequences allows the identification of proteins responsible for host interactions and secondary metabolites for various applications. The knowledge produced from gene functions and their metabolic pathways is important for designing therapies as an alternative to drugs (Guo and Wang 2014). Identification of genes involved in host interactions, specifically in plant pathogenic fungi, produces new knowledge required to predict the emergence of fungal diseases and the surveillance of plant health. This is not only limited to phytopathogenic fungi but also applies to fungal diseases in humans, where they detect and monitor the spread of the disease, determine the distribution of the pathogen, predict outbreaks, and their evolution during outbreaks (Cuomo 2017). Furthermore, information on endophytic fungal genomes facilitates the development of alternatives for pesticides and fertilizers. In addition, advances in whole-genome studies facilitate the genotyping of pathogenic species for diagnostic purposes. These diagnostics have been applied to both human and plant pathogens for their precise and rapid detection and identification, which is crucial to managing the diseases effectively (Kidd et al. 2020; Hariharan and Prasannath 2021).", "Whole-genome sequencing has been carried out for numerous species in the past decade. Advances made from these data mainly include phylogenomics for taxonomic organization, designing effective therapies against targeted fungal pathogens, and the development of new antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and secondary metabolites necessary for industrial applications, among many others. The use of whole-genomes in phylogenomic studies provides sufficient data to elucidate relationships deeper in geological time, as well as to resolve relationships that evolved in short divergence times, which may lead to resolve problems in taxonomy (James et al. 2020). Further studies on these whole-genome sequences allow to perform functional genomic studies on the genes predicted from the whole genome sequences, thus providing new knowledge to predict their lifestyles (G\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez and Kemen 2021).

Upon infection, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enters and kills the T-helper (CD4+) immune cell in the process of replicating. With this impaired adaptive immunity, the patient becomes susceptible to a plethora of pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms. Current and very successful treatment is a combination of inhibitors of HIV integrase, reverse transcriptase and proteases known as c-ART (combination AntiRetroviral Therapy). This has effectively reduced the burden of disease in Western countries, to such an extent that patients can live with the infection for decades, and in this part of the world AIDS is no longer seen as a threat, but rather HIV infection has become a chronic disease. However, the death toll outside the industrialized world where access to medication is limited is still unacceptably high. In addition, the disease is suppressed rather than eradicated, because the virus remains dormant in a small reservoir of infected cells, a process known as latency. Much research has therefore been devoted to get the virus out of the cells, using latency reversal agents (LRAs). The virus then becomes in reach for elimination by the immune system and presence of c-ART therapy prevents new rounds of infection. Numerous compounds have been proposed, but most of these were either toxic, or insufficiently effective and have failed thus far to make a significant impact on the latent HIV reservoir or lead to cure (reviewed in Stoszko et al. 2019).", "AIDS is a well-known sexually or blood-transmitted viral disease which, despite improved antiviral medication, still causes half a million deaths each year.

Low and medium throughput screening systems of crude extracts of supernatants were dissected by orthogonal fractionation and mass spectrometry (MS) coupled to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

Gliotoxin is a fungal extralite which is produced by Aspergillus fumigatus and some other species. The mechanism of action of GTX in reversal of latency in HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells is by disrupting 7SK snRNP, a complex that sequesters the positive transcription elongation complex (PTEFb), which is required for efficient HIV gene expression.

Also, the efficacy of synergistic combinations of GTX with other known LRAs was analyzed, and synergistic effects of caffeic phenethyl ester (CAPE), pyrimethamine (PYR) and macrolactams with gliotoxin were assessed.
