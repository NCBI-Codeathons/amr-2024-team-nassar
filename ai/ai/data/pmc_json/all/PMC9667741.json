However, there are still many unknown fields regarding the beneficial plant-microbe interactions. In this study, we have assessed the amount or impact of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-derived genes in plants that have potentials to confer abiotic stress resistance. We have identified a total of 235 gene entries in fourteen high-quality plant genomes belonging to phyla Chlorophyta and Streptophyta that confer resistance against a wide range of abiotic pressures acquired from microbes through independent HGTs. These genes encode proteins contributed to toxic metal resistance (e.g., ChrA, CopA, CorA), osmotic and drought stress resistance (e.g., Na+/proline symporter, potassium/proton antiporter), acid resistance (e.g., PcxA, ArcA, YhdG), heat and cold stress resistance (e.g., DnaJ, Hsp20, CspA), oxidative stress resistance (e.g., GST, PoxA, glutaredoxin), DNA damage resistance (e.g., Rad25, Rad51, UvrD), and organic pollutant resistance (e.g., CytP450, laccase, CbbY). Phylogenetic analyses have supported the HGT inferences as the plant lineages are all clustering closely with distant microbial lineages. Deep-learning-based protein structure prediction and analyses, in combination with expression assessment based on codon adaption index (CAI) further corroborated the functionality and expressivity of the HGT genes in plant genomes. A case-study applying fold comparison and molecular dynamics (MD) of the HGT-driven CytP450 gave a more detailed illustration on the resemblance and evolutionary linkage between the plant recipient and microbial donor sequences. Together, the microbe-originated HGT genes identified in plant genomes and their participation in abiotic pressures resistance indicate a more profound impact of HGT on the adaptive evolution of plants.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Plants, the most profoundly distributed lineage on earth, possess the remarkable abilities to convert solar energy into bio-matter and produce oxygen while consume the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. At the same time, plants have to face the frequent offense of inhospitable abiotic stresses caused by the constant fluctuations of global climate since plants cannot \u201crun away\u201d from them. The challenging conditions like drought, radiation, nutrient deficiencies, temperature extremes (cold and heat), metal ion toxicity, salinity and organic pollution are typical abiotic stress factors that plants frequently encounter (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022). These abiotic factors have drastically influenced plant distribution and growth status globally (Nolan et\u00a0al., 2018). It is long known that beneficial microbes are helping plants to overcome climate change and other adverse conditions through a variety of ways (Sch\u00fctzend\u00fcbel and Polle, 2002; Haney et\u00a0al., 2015; Murali et\u00a0al., 2021). For example, microbes can increase the activity of plant antioxidant defense enzyme (Mastouri et\u00a0al., 2012), release beneficial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that trigger resistance response (Liu and Zhang, 2015), and modulate the expression of plant metal transporters against the accumulation of heavy metals (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2020). However, many aspects of the plant-microbe interactions for mutual benefits are still in the \u201cblack box\u201d and lack in-depth mechanism analysis.", "Plants, the most profoundly distributed lineage on earth, possess the remarkable abilities to convert solar energy into bio-matter and produce oxygen while consume the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.

Studies on HGT genes introduced into eukaryotic taxa have been expanding fast in the last twenty years as next-generation sequencing technology has made large-scale genome data available (Soucy et\u00a0al., 2015). Recent researches have demonstrated that genes in plant genomes important for the function of specific plant activities, including the biosynthesis of plant structure components and hormones, plant defense, nitrogen recycling and stress resistance, can be obtained via the omnipresent HGT process (Yue et\u00a0al., 2012). It is strongly proposed in a recent review that HGTs possess the potency to drastically influence plant evolutionary path by imparting selective advantages (Wickell and Li, 2020). Here are some examples illustrating the importance of microbe-derived HGTs in plants that confer adaptive benefits. Firstly, it is found that the ancestor of land plants acquired a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), the entry point of the phenylpropanoid pathway, through HGT during symbioses with soil bacteria and fungi (Emiliani et\u00a0al., 2009); The second case is that Physcomitrella patens is suggested to acquire from bacteria acyl-activating enzyme 18 (AAE18)/flavin monooxygenase (YUC3) for auxin biosynthesis, guanine deaminase, allantoate amidohydrolase and ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase associated with purine degradation, as well as subtilases for protein degradation (Yue et\u00a0al., 2012). Besides, Li et\u00a0al. (2018) detected that the squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC) encoding genes in three plant clades (mosses, liverworts and lycophytes/ferns) are interspersing with bacterial SHCs, suggesting the occurrence of independent and repeated HGT events for enhanced adaption since the product of SHC, hopanoid, constitutes plant cell membrane important for maintaining cell integrity. Lastly, it is reported that the adaptive genes in Zygnematophyceae, GRAS and PYR/PYL/RCAR that enhance resistance to abiotic stresses (e.g., desiccation), were obtained through HGT from nearby soil bacteria (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2019). However, many of these previous investigations focused mainly on individual plant lineage or limited HGT events on important economic aspects such as the valuable plant metabolism pathways. Despite these efforts, we still have little knowledge on the amount or impact of HGT-derived genes in plants that have potentials to confer resistance against a wide range of abiotic stresses (e.g., low pH, osmotic pressure, heat and cold stress) and hence promote the growth of plants in extreme conditions. It is still an open question that if there is microbe-originated HGT(s) that has facilitated plant to adapt such abiotic stresses. And if there are such HGT genes, what are their functions in combating abiotic stresses and to what extent are they distributed in the plant genomes?", "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), referring to the exchange of genetic material between distant lineages, is considered as an effective mechanism to spread evolutionary success in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Huang, 2013; Daubin and Sz\u00f6ll\u0151si, 2016).

HGT can serve as a significant force that supplies species with genetic innovations and regulation flexibility that guarantees successful migration into novel niches. In our results, we found that the most commonly seen microbial HGT donor taxon for acquisition of resistance genes is Burkholderiaceae (n=10). Members of Burkholderiaceae are characterized as plant-associated, which usually constitute the core floral community (Massoni et\u00a0al., 2021). Besides, we found that Chlorophyta taxa (e.g. Chlorella variabilis NC64A, n=42) generally have more HGT resistance genes than lower-grade Streptophyta taxa (e.g. Physcomitrella patens patens (moss), n=21), which outnumber those from high-grade land plant (e.g. Ricinus communis Hale (castor bean), n=14). Such richness of HGT genes associated with abiotic stress resistance especially those within the transition-stage lineages might have reflected a ring linking to the early adaption processes of plant to accomplish the colonization of land environment from aquatic. These HGT genes seem well-suited to combat abiotic factors more frequently encountered in land environments (e.g., desiccation, fluctuations of temperature, UV radiation), in consistence with previous studies (de Vries et\u00a0al., 2016; Pennisi, 2019; Bowles et\u00a0al., 2020). The mechanism leading to such abundant cross-lineage gene transfer into plant genomes might be explained by the \u201cweak-link model\u201d (Huang, 2013). Namely, foreign DNA fragments (e.g., from microbes) could be naturally imported into the plant receptors at the susceptible stages in plant lifecycle, such as the single-cell/preliminary stages (germline cells, embryos, etc.) or dedifferentiation/asexual reproduction stages. The microbe-plant HGT processes can be promoted by intimate or direct physical contact through symbiosis, parasitism, infection, or other associations, especially when the weakly-protected cells are exposed to the environment. Once getting into the cell, fixation of HGT genes to the recipient genome can be facilitated by the still undergoing organellar DNA fragment integrations into the nuclear chromosome in the developing cells, followed by vertical transfer of integrated HGT genes to offspring cells via mitosis (Huang, 2013).", "The emergence and mechanism of HGT events (\u201cWhy does lateral transfer occur in so many species and how?\u201d) is recommended as a still-pending and significant scientific question worthy of more in-depth ivestigations by the editorial of the journal Science in the article \u201cSo much more to know\u201d (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2005), and we prudently considered that the present research might have supplied some hints for this question.
