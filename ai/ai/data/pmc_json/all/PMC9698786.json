["Multiple animal species have evolved resistance to the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) through changes in voltage-gated sodium ion channels (VGSCs). Amino acid substitutions in TTX-resistant lineages appear to be positionally convergent with changes in homologous residues associated with reductions in TTX block. We used homology modeling coupled with docking simulations to test whether positionally convergent substitutions generate functional convergence at the level of TTX\u2013channel interactions. We found little evidence that amino acids at convergent positions generated similar patterns among TTX-resistant animal lineages across several metrics, including number of polar contacts, polar contact position, and estimates of binding energy. Though binding energy values calculated for TTX docking were reduced for some TTX-resistant channels, not all TTX-resistant channels and not all of our analyses returned reduced binding energy values for TTX-resistant channels. Our results do not support a simple model of toxin resistance where a reduced number of bonds between TTX and the channel protein prevents blocking. Rather models that incorporate flexibility and movement of the protein overall may better describe how homologous substitutions in the channel cause changes in TTX block.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Convergent evolution describes the evolution of similar phenotypes in evolutionarily divergent lineages [1,2].

Salamanders in the genus Taricha possess TTX, which they use as a chemical defense [13]. Similarly, blue-ringed octopuses (Genus Hapalochlaena) possess high levels of TTX, which they use for both defense and as a venom [14,15,16,17]. Garter snakes in the genus Thamnophis consume TTX-bearing Taricha newts and are engaged in complex arms races across the range of sympatry between newt and snake populations in western North America [18,19,20,21]. All of these species have evolved organismal resistance to TTX through adaptive substitutions in VGSCs, the proteins that are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in most metazoans [22]. Although organismal resistance to TTX requires adaptation in multiple VGSC paralogs (e.g., both muscle- and nerve-specific proteins), a key step in the TTX-resistant phenotype appears to be the evolution of TTX resistance in the primary channel expressed in skeletal muscle (NaV1.4; newts and snakes) or in the primary TTX-sensitive ortholog in neurons (NaV1; Hapalochlaena octopuses).", "A striking example of apparent convergent protein evolution is the evolution of TTX-resistant voltage-gated sodium ion channels (VGSCs) in salamanders, snakes, and octopuses that are exposed to the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) [8,9,10,11,12].

The ion-conducting pore of metazoan voltage-gated sodium channels is formed from four homologous protein domains that comprise the VGSC alpha subunit [23]. The outer pore of the channel is composed of amino acids from each of these domains and contains the TTX binding site, the ion selectivity filter, and other structures that modulate channel activity and ion conductance [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. Two highly conserved canonical amino acid motifs, DEKA and EEMD (sometimes EEID in invertebrates), form two rings of mostly negatively charged amino acids at the opening of the channel pore [30,33]. Amino acids in the innermost ring (DEKA) form the selectivity filter and interact directly with TTX [26,27,29,30]. Similarly, amino acids in the EEMD motif interact with TTX and modulate ion permeability [30,34]. Substitutions in all domains of the VGSC can render the channel TTX-insensitive but changes associated with resistance in NaV1.4 from Taricha and Thamnophis as well as NaV1 from Hapalochlaena are localized in domains III and IV [9,10,12]. Strikingly, Taricha and Thamnophis NaV1.4 as well as Hapalochlaena NaV1 all possess substitutions in the domain IV aspartic acid residue (D) of the EEMD motif as well as substitutions at an adjacent downstream residue (Figure 1). Channels from Taricha newts and Hapalochlaena octopuses share another amino acid substitution in the EEMD motif in which a threonine replaces the methionine (M) in domain III. Furthermore, Taricha and Thamnophis channels both possess substitutions in homologous isoleucine residues near the domain IV alanine residue (A) of the DEKA selectivity filter (Figure 1). Together, Taricha and Thamnophis NaV1.4 channels with these substitutions are extremely resistant to TTX block and require TTX concentrations in the 10\u2013100 \u00b5M range to block channel function, more than 1000 times the concentrations that block TTX-sensitive NaV1.4 channels from salamanders and snakes [9,10].", "Convergent evolution in Taricha, Thamnophis, and Hapalochlaena extends beyond the gene level to include within-protein patterns of convergence.

Conclusions", "The results described here suggest that homologous substitutions in different lineages of TTX-resistant vertebrates do not act in a convergent fashion. None of the metrics we estimated, including the number and position of polar contacts, showed evidence of functional convergence in snakes, salamanders, or the TTX-bearing Greater Blue-Ringed Octopus. The lack of support for our hypothesis could result from model-related errors, if, for example, our models lack the resolution to differentiate between closely related channels, or it could result from structural differences in channels that change the effects of homologous substitutions. However, we saw no evidence from model parameters that either of the tools we used was more or less effective in a given lineage. Instead, we argue that our observed results are more consistent with a protein evolution model that predicts context-dependent effects of amino acid substitutions, as we observed for domain III and IV pore substitutions in VGSCs. These results are congruent with a growing body of evidence that contingency plays a critical role in generating the functional and selective value of novel substitutions [52,53]. Although our ability to draw conclusions about the TTX binding site and the mechanisms underlying resistance in modelled channels is limited, our results suggest that the properties of the whole channel, such as flexibility and shape, may play a role in modulating or mediating TTX resistance.", "The results described here suggest that homologous substitutions in different lineages of TTX-resistant vertebrates do not act in a convergent fashion.
