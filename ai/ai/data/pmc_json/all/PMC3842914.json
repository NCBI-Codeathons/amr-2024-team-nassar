We isolated a new class of FabI inhibitor from Penicillium chrysogenum, which produces various antibiotics, the mechanisms of some of them are unknown. The isolated FabI inhibitor was determined to be meleagrin by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral analyses, and its more active and inactive derivatives were chemically prepared. Consistent with their selective inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus FabI, meleagrin and its more active derivatives directly bound to S. aureus FabI in a fluorescence quenching assay, inhibited intracellular fatty acid biosynthesis and growth of S. aureus, and increased the minimum inhibitory concentration for fabI-overexpressing S. aureus. The compounds that were not effective against the FabK isoform, however, inhibited the growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae that contained only the FabK isoform. Additionally no resistant mutant to the compounds was obtained. Importantly, fabK-overexpressing Escherichia coli was not resistant to these compounds, but was resistant to triclosan. These results demonstrate that the compounds inhibited another target in addition to FabI. Thus, meleagrin is a new class of FabI inhibitor with at least one additional mode of action that could have potential for treating multidrug-resistant bacteria.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus have become an important global health concern [1], [2]. One approach to combat antibiotic resistance is to identify new drugs that can function through novel mechanisms of action. One such target is bacterial type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), which is essential for bacterial cell growth [3]\u2013[5].", "Multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus have become an important global health concern [1], [2].

One such target is bacterial type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), which is essential for bacterial cell growth [3]\u2013[5].", "FASII is conducted by a set of individual enzymes, whereas mammalian fatty acid synthesis is mediated by a single multifunctional enzyme-acyl carrier protein (ACP) complex referred to as type I. Enoyl-ACP reductase catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step of the chain-elongation process of the FASII. Four isoforms have been reported for enoyl-ACP reductase. FabI is highly conserved among most bacteria, including S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Streptococcus pneumoniae contains only FabK, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa contain both FabI and FabK, and Bacillus subtilis contains both FabI and FabL. Recently, the FabV isoform was isolated from Vibrio cholera, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia mallei\n[6], [7]. No analogue protein is present in mammals for similar transformation; thus, FabI inhibitors should not interfere with mammalian fatty acid synthesis. Because of these properties, FabI is an attractive target for antibacterial drug development [8], [9]. As drugs with single targets such as rifampicin and fosfomycin are particularly vulnerable to mutational resistance [10], FabI-specific inhibitors also have a tendency to develop resistance in bacteria by mutations that alter the drug-binding site. FabI is known to be the main target for triclosan and isoniazid, which have been used in consumer products and for treating tuberculosis, respectively [11], [12]. Triclosan-resistant bacteria and isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis are highly prevalent because of point mutations in their FabI genes [13]\u2013[15]. In addition, rapid mutation development has been often reported in synthetic FabI inhibitors [16]. Thus, it has been recently emphasized that ideal antibiotics should bind to multiple targets [17].", "FASII is conducted by a set of individual enzymes, whereas mammalian fatty acid synthesis is mediated by a single multifunctional enzyme-acyl carrier protein (ACP) complex referred to as type I.
