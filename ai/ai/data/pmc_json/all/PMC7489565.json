["Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.", "Current address: Leibniz Institute of Natural Products Research and Infection Biology, Jena, Germany", "The type I polyketide SF2487/A80577 (herein referred to as tetromadurin) is a polyether tetronate ionophore antibiotic produced by the terrestrial Gram-positive bacterium Actinomadura verrucosospora. Tetromadurin is closely related to the polyether tetronates tetronasin (M139603) and tetronomycin, all of which are characterised by containing a tetronate, cyclohexane, tetrahydropyran, and at least one tetrahydrofuran ring. We have sequenced the genome of Actinomadura verrucosospora to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for tetromadurin biosynthesis (the mad gene cluster). Based on bioinformatic analysis of the 32 genes present within the cluster a plausible biosynthetic pathway for tetromadurin biosynthesis is proposed. Functional confirmation of the mad gene cluster is obtained by performing in-frame deletions in each of the genes mad10 and mad31, which encode putative cyclase enzymes responsible for cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran formation, respectively. Furthermore, the A. verrucosospora \u0394mad10 mutant produces a novel tetromadurin metabolite that according to mass spectrometry analysis is analogous to the recently characterised partially cyclised tetronasin intermediate lacking its cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings. Our results therefore elucidate the biosynthetic machinery of tetromadurin biosynthesis and lend support for a conserved mechanism of cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran biosynthesis across polyether tetronates.", "Data Availability", "All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.

It belongs to the same family of polyether tetronates as tetronasin (2) (produced by Streptomyces longisporoflavus) and tetronomycin (3) (produced by Streptomyces sp.

Tetronasin and tetronomycin are notable for being near- \u201cmirror image\u201d versions of one another, containing the opposite configuration at each of ten equivalent stereocenters. Tetromadurin contains structural elements of each, its cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings of tetromadurin having identical configuration to those in tetronasin, while its tetronate ring contains a tetronomycin-like exocyclic double bond. All three compounds, like other polyethers such as monensin, are ionophore antibiotics that disrupt ion signalling across cell membranes [1, 3\u20135]. In addition, tetromadurin has also demonstrated antiretroviral and antimalarial activity [1, 6].", "SF2487/A80577 (1) (referred to in this manuscript as tetromadurin) is a type I polyketide polyether tetronate isolated independently from Actinomadura verrucosospora by two industrial research groups in the early 1990s [1, 2] (Fig 1).

Only one of the detected biosynthetic gene clusters, ca. 110 kbp and featuring 32 genes (CP053892:2037887\u20132164555), possessed the biosynthetic features likely required for tetromadurin biosynthesis. The exact boundaries of the tetromadurin biosynthetic gene cluster (the mad gene cluster) were decided on the basis of flanking genes whose annotation suggested no obvious connection with tetromadurin biosynthesis (such as primary metabolism). The proposed functions of the genes in the mad gene cluster, predicted using BLAST [17], is presented in Fig 2. A diagram of the spatial organisation of the mad gene cluster is presented in Fig 3.
