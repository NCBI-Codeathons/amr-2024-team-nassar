["Abstract", "The diversity of venomous organisms and the toxins they produce have been increasingly investigated, but taxonomic bias remains important. Neogastropods, a group of marine predators representing almost 22% of the known gastropod diversity, evolved a wide range of feeding strategies, including the production of toxins to subdue their preys. However, whether the diversity of these compounds is at the origin of the hyperdiversification of the group and how genome evolution may correlate with both the compounds and species diversities remain understudied. Among the available gastropods genomes, only eight, with uneven quality assemblies, belong to neogastropods. Here, we generated chromosome-level assemblies of two species belonging to the Tonnoidea and Muricoidea superfamilies (Monoplex corrugatus and Stramonita haemastoma). The two obtained high-quality genomes had 3 and 2.2\u2005Gb, respectively, and 92\u201389% of the total assembly conformed 35 pseudochromosomes in each species. Through the analysis of syntenic blocks, Hox gene cluster duplication, and synonymous substitutions distribution pattern, we inferred the occurrence of a whole genome duplication event in both genomes. As these species are known to release venom, toxins were annotated in both genomes, but few of them were found in homologous chromosomes. A comparison of the expression of ohnolog genes (using transcriptomes from osphradium and salivary glands in S. haemastoma), where both copies were differentially expressed, showed that most of them had similar expression profiles. The high quality of these genomes makes them valuable reference in their respective taxa, facilitating the identification of genome-level processes at the origin of their evolutionary success.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Venomous organisms display a high level of diversification, both at the taxonomic and the functional levels (Casewell et al. 2013; Fry et al. 2015; Zancolli and Casewell 2020). The production of venom has been reported across at least 101 independent lineages in animals (Schendel et al. 2019), among which some well-known examples are snakes, spiders, and scorpions, with multiple instances of convergent evolution (King et al. 2008; Barua and Mikheyev 2019; Forde et al. 2022). Venom is a mix of toxins (mostly proteins and peptides) and other molecules, produced and stored in specialized anatomical structures of an organism and injected in another organism to disrupt its normal physiological processes (Fry et al. 2009). Venomous animals thus developed complex systems adapted to their target organisms, comprising not only toxic molecules but also the self-resistance mechanism needed to deal with their production, storage, and delivery, as well as specialized morphological structures including secretory glands and delivery weapons (Schendel et al. 2019). Venoms can be used for multiple purposes, including predation, defense, or intraspecific competition (Casewell et al. 2013). The specific functions of the toxins that compose the venoms are extremely diversified, and in most cases, toxins act synergistically to incapacitate the target organism by inducing paralysis through targeting neuromuscular receptors, causing blood loss by injecting anticoagulant, or causing intense pain by triggering pain receptors, among other mechanisms (Bohlen et al. 2011; Zancolli and Casewell 2020). Given the adaptive value of venom, understanding the origin and evolution of such diversified molecules and the organisms that produce them have become crucial in evolutionary biology.", "Venomous organisms display a high level of diversification, both at the taxonomic and the functional levels (Casewell et al. 2013; Fry et al. 2015; Zancolli and Casewell 2020).

Cone snails represent around 1,000 species (WoRMS Editorial Board 2022), are widely distributed, and have different hunting targets (Zhao and Antunes 2022). Thus, more and more toxins (\u201cconotoxins\u201d) were found (\u223c200 toxins produced per species) in Conus species (Balaji et al. 2000; Buczek et al. 2005; Akondi et al. 2014), some of which entered clinical trials that, in one case, led to the market: the synthetic analog of a conotoxin, Ziconotide, is currently commercialized as an anesthetic (Layer and McIntosh 2006; Fedosov et al. 2012; Safavi-Hemami et al. 2019; Reynaud et al. 2020; Zhao and Antunes 2022).", "Neogastropoda is a group of hyperdiverse predatory marine mollusks.

The majority of them are rich in cysteine residues, arranged in specific patterns (\u2018cysteine frameworks\u2019), resulting in disulfide bounds that determine the precise 3D conformation and high stability of the toxins themselves (Jin et al. 2019). Conotoxins were shown to have diverged, at least partly, through the onset of gene variants, especially due to insertions and deletions (Yang and Zhou 2020). Toxins closely related to conotoxins or sharing the same structural conformation were also found in other Conoidea (e.g., in Turridae, with longer mature peptide regions [Watkins et al. 2006], in Terebridae [Gorson et al. 2015], and in Drilliidae [Lu et al. 2020]). Beside conotoxins, a large variety of toxins were described in the Neogastropoda, acting as pore forming (e.g., colutoxins [Gerdol et al. 2018], hemolytic [e.g., echotoxins; Shiomi et al. 2002]) or anesthetic toxins like ShKT (Gerdol et al. 2019), to cite only few of their putative functions. Toxins were found in species belonging to multiple neogastropod families, including Babyloniidae, Muricidae, Buccinidae, Colubrariidae (Turner et al. 2018), Mitridae (Reynaud et al. 2020), and Costellaridae (Kuznetsova et al. 2022) but were reported in some of the closely related Caenogastropoda as well, namely the Tonnoidea families, Cassidae, Ranellidae, and Charoniidae (Hwang et al. 2021; Jia et al. 2022). However, the diversity of these toxins, the genomic mechanisms that may have triggered their evolution, and their potential adaptive and evolutionary implications remain understudied in non-Conoidea neogastropods. In particular, for a comprehensive evaluation of the molecular mechanisms of venom toxins evolution, a genomic perspective is indeed required. However, only a few comparative genomic studies are available to date on venomous organisms (Drukewitz and von Reumont 2019; Zancolli and Casewell 2020; Almeida et al. 2021; Barua and Mikheyev 2021; Koludarov et al. 2022), suggesting that duplication and neofunctionalization events constitute crucial steps in the onset of toxins from ancestral genes (Wong and Belov 2012; Giorgianni et al. 2020).

This approach is used to estimate the timing of gene duplication events by comparing the number of synonymous substitutions between paralogs (synonymous divergence) to estimate the time since the gene duplication event occurred (Van de Peer et al. 2009). Synonymous substitutions, which are changes in the DNA sequence that do not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein, are used because they are less likely to be affected by natural selection than nonsynonymous substitutions, which do change the amino acid sequence of the protein. Here, the distribution of Ks between all paralogous genes in each of the neogastropods and M. corrugatus (fig. 3B) showed a first high peak corresponding to recent events of duplication as very few substitutions were detected.

It provides increased opportunities for rearrangement, deletion, and insertion events that could contribute to evolvability, the capacity of species to adapt to different environments and diversify (Phuong et al. 2019), ultimately leading to the emergence of adaptive evolutionary novelties (Flagel and Wendel 2009; Van de Peer et al. 2009). Indeed, WGDs have been detected in many species-rich lineages, including, for example teleost fishes (Glasauer and Neuhauss 2014) and orchids (Moriyama and Koshiba-Takeuchi 2018), to name only few of them. In caenogastropods, karyotype analyses have been carried out on several individual species, providing data for a subsequent study that predicted a WGD event in Neogastropoda, Tonnoidea, Cypraeidae, and Capulidae based on genome size and chromosome counts (Hallinan and Lindberg 2011). WGD has been subsequently confirmed in C. ventricosus (Pardos-Blas et al. 2021), based on the detection of synteny and colinear blocks, the distribution of Ks peak, and the duplication of Hox gene clusters. Other WGD events were described in gastropods within the Heterobranchia subclass, as for example in A. immaculata and A. fulica (Liu et al. 2021), each possessing 31 chromosomes. In this work, we detected synteny between the different species (fig. 2), and the comparison with P. canaliculata showed a doubling (or sometimes quadrupling) of the pseudochromosome number in each of our target species. Having more than two copies of a chromosome raises the question of multiple WGD, but it can also be explained by duplication events limited to some chromosomes only. To clarify this issue, genome comparison between more species within neogastropods and in closely related caenogastropods like, for example Tonnoidea, Calyptraeidae, or Cypraeidae families (Lemarcis et al. 2022), would be needed. In addition, the exact timing of the WGD event remains to be determined.

Expanding genomic characterization to a broader array of taxa within the caenogastropods could help shedding light into the role of WGD and major genomic rearrangements in the origin of hyperdiverse groups.", "Materials and Methods", "Materials and Methods", "DNA and RNA Samples", "DNA and RNA Samples", "DNA and RNA Samples", "One female (MNHN-IM-2019-21838) and one male (MNHN-IM-2019-21839) specimen of M. corrugatus were collected in Corsica, France, whereas one female (MNHN-IM-2019-21840) and two male (MNHN-M-2019-21841 and MNHN-IM-2019-21842) specimens of S. haemastoma were collected in Capo Linaro, Italy.

The phylogeny of homeobox domains predicted was performed on their multiple alignment using the MAFFT webserver tool with default parameters (Katoh and Frith 2012) and IQ-tree v1.6.12 (Minh et al. 2020).", "Hox genes were specifically annotated in M. corrugatus, S. haemastoma, and in four species representatives of different gastropod subclasses, having their genomes sequenced and available: P. canaliculata (Caenogastropods; Architaenioglossa), Ch. squamiferum (Neomphalina), H. rubra (Vetigastropoda), and L. gigantea (Patellogastropoda). In addition, we annotated Homeobox genes in a Bivalvia species, P. maximus. First of all, we created a database of homeobox genes from different species including Cr. gigas (Zhang et al. 2012), L. goshimai (Huan et al. 2020), Acanthochitona rubrolineata (Huan et al. 2020), C. ventricosus (Pardos-Blas et al. 2021), Elysia marginata (Maeda et al. 2021), and P. canaliculata (full NCBI annotation). Then, the database was aligned against all predicted proteomes considered in this study. From the five best matches, we assigned the predominant function (minimum of three same functions over five). This constituted a second database of homeobox genes, and was aligned again on the same proteomes. Proteins not found in the first round and having more than 60% of identity and aligned on more than 60% of the sequence length were kept. Then, all the proteins detected were mapped on the seven genomes of interest using exonerate v2.2 (Slater and Birney 2005) and all matches were given to Gmove v2 (Dubarry et al. 2016) for automatic annotation.
