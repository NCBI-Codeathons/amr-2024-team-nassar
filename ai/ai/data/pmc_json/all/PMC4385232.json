["Surfactin is one of the most popular biosurfactants due to its numerous potential applications. The usually aerobic production via fermentation of Bacillus subtilis is accompanied by vigorous foaming which leads to complex constructions and great expense. Therefore it is reasonable to search for alternative foam-free production processes. The current study introduces a novel approach to produce Surfactin in a foam-free process applying a strictly anaerobic bioreactor cultivation. The process was performed several times with different glucose concentrations in mineral salt medium. The fermentations were analyzed regarding specific (qSurfactin, vol. qSurfactin) and overall product yields (YP/X, YP/S) as well as substrate utilization (YX/S). Fermentations in which 2.5\u00a0g/L glucose were employed proofed to be the most effective, reaching product yields of YP/X\u2009=\u20090.278\u00a0g/g. Most interesting, the product yields exceeded classical aerobic fermentations, in which foam fractionation was applied. Additionally, values for specific production rate qSurfactin (0.005\u00a0g/(g\u2219h)) and product yield per consumed substrate (YP/S\u2009=\u20090.033\u00a0g/g) surpass results of comparable foam-free processes. The current study introduces an alternative to produce a biosurfactant that overcomes the challenges of severe foaming and need for additional constructions.", "Electronic supplementary material", "Electronic supplementary material", "The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13568-015-0107-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13568-015-0107-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Biosurfactants become increasingly attractive based on their biodegradability and production on the basis of renewable resources (Banat et al. 2010). Surfactin is one of the most popular biosurfactants and was already discovered in 1968 by Arima et al. (1968). The lipopeptide consists of a seven amino acid peptide ring comprising a \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acid. Surfactin is produced by Bacillus subtilis, a gram positive bacterium known for its application in several industrial processes, for instance the production of detergent enzymes and others (Schallmey et al. 2004). The molecule exhibits various different characteristics, which might lead to several applications. For instance, Surfactin was shown to improve plant self-resistance mechanism against soil bacteria (Ongena et al. 2007) or vigorously affects mycoplasma cells (Vollenbroich et al. 1997). Therefore, next to an application in detergents, washing agents or food products, a usage in agriculture or pharmaceutical products is also imaginable.", "Biosurfactants become increasingly attractive based on their biodegradability and production on the basis of renewable resources (Banat et al. 2010).

The main challenge in cultivating microorganisms producing biosurfactants is to overcome this severe foam production. In the majority of cases foaming is handled by the addition of antifoam agents. Unfortunately, this strategy harbors several disadvantages, as antifoam agents are expensive and very hard to remove in downstream processes. The second most common method to cope with foam formation is to disrupt the foam by shear stress or pressure using foam breakers. However, this method is often insufficient and increases the overall costs for the production of biosurfactants. Another, more elegant, way to manage foaming in biosurfactant production processes is to apply foam fractionation, which was already shown by Cooper et al. 1981 (Cooper et al. 1981). This technique inverts the disadvantage into an advantage by using the accumulation of biosurfactants in the foam for in situ product enrichment and recovery. The Surfactin producer Bacillus subtilis is especially suited for the employment of foam fractionation, yielding high values in product recovery and enrichment (Willenbacher et al. 2014). Although this is a possible way to handle foam and to improve product yields, a realization in industrial scale is probably unrealistic in the near future.", "Naturally, amphiphile molecules produced by bacteria in cultivation processes accumulate at gas\u2013liquid interfaces and lead to massive foam formation.

Several attempts have been made to establish foam-free fermentation processes. Ohno et al. for instance employed a solid state fermentation of recombinant Bacillus subtilis MI113 (pC112), using soybean curd residue as solid substrate (Ohno et al. 1995), which led to a yield of 2.0\u00a0g/kg (Surfactin per wet weight). Another attempt to produce Surfactin in a foam-free fashion implemented a membrane bioreactor (Coutte et al. 2010). A culture of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 obtained a maximal Surfactin concentration of 0.242\u00a0g/L. However, a significant amount of Surfactin was adsorbed at the membranes and oxygen transfer was reduced significantly. In contrast, Chtioui et al. focused on a rotating disc bioreactor for the production of Surfactin, allowing Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 to grow free and immobilized in a biofilm at the same time (Chtioui et al. 2012). Aeration was realized above the fluid level, when the overgrown discs arose from the liquid. Maximal Surfactin concentrations of 0.212\u00a0g/L were obtained, but oxygen supply was limited and Fengycin concentrations surpassed Surfactin concentrations by far. While all these studies implemented innovative ideas to circumvent foaming, those processes are either difficult to scale up or lack high specificity.", "Another artful approach is to avoid foaming at all instead of dealing with it.

All figures present the course of the CDW, CO2, phosphoric acid, nitrate, glucose and Surfactin concentrations with time. The fermentation shown in Figure\u00a03 endured 55\u00a0h. The process was terminated because the levels of CO2 and CDW were drastically decreasing and the glucose was completely consumed. During the fermentation the CDW continually increased reaching 0.320\u00a0g/L at its maximum. The amount of CO2 (no longer solved in the medium and therefore carried on within the N2 stream in the headspace) increased simultaneously with the CDW. Meanwhile the glucose concentration consistently decreased until its depletion.

The amount of added phosphoric acid to adjust the mediums pH level increased significantly after 34\u00a0h of cultivation. The demand for pH regulation is caused by Bacillus subtilis anaerobic metabolism. In this pathway nitrate is used as terminal electron acceptor. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite via a nitrate reductase and the additional conversion of nitrite to ammonia via a nitrite reductase results in the production of an alkaline end product.

Table\u00a01 presents an overview of the most interesting process parameters, such as cultivation time, maximal CDW, maximal Surfactin concentration, maximal growth rate, product yields (YP/X, YP/S, qSurfactin, vol. qSurfactin) and substrate utilization (YX/S). All illustrated values are mean values of two fermentations. The duration of the fermentation depended on the starting glucose concentration. Fermentations with 2.5\u00a0g/L glucose lasted for 55\u00a0h, whereas fermentations with 10\u00a0g/L glucose averagely endured 161\u00a0h. Fermentations with 5\u00a0g/L and 7.5\u00a0g/L glucose ran for approximately 100\u00a0h. The maximal CDW was reached during fermentations with 7.5\u00a0g/L glucose (0.856\u00a0g/L). In contrast, only 0.320\u00a0g/L CDW were yielded in fermentations with 2.5\u00a0g/L glucose. Fermentations with 5\u00a0g/L glucose or more reached at least 0.105\u00a0g/L Surfactin as maximal concentration. Fermentations with 2.5\u00a0g/L glucose earned 0.087\u00a0g/L Surfactin. The highest maximal growth rate \u03bcmax was reached by fermentations with 7.5\u00a0g/L glucose (0.118\u00a0h\u22121), whereas fermentations with 10\u00a0g/L glucose only reached maximal growth rates of 0.074\u00a0h\u22121. The values of overall YP/X differed widely between the fermentations with different glucose concentrations.

To outline the differences between these methods and a traditional aerobic cultivation for the production of Surfactin, these results are additionally collated with a fermentation process applying foam fractionation (Willenbacher et al. 2014).Table 2\nSummary of the process parameters of different foam-free processes\n\nChtioui et al. \n2012\n\nCoutte et al.\n2010\n\nThe current study\n\nWillenbacher et al. \n2014\nSurfactin producer\nBacillus subtilis ATCC 21332\nBacillus subtilis ATCC 21332\nBacillus subtilis DSM 10T\n\nBacillus subtilis DSM 10T\nFermentation approachRotating discsMembrane bioreactorAnaerobic, no gas flowFoam fractionationCultivation time [h]72725530Max. cSurfactin [g/L]0.212*0.242*0.0873.995 (foam)YP/X [g/g]0.0680.078*0.2780.192YX/S [g/g]0.1890.164*0.1200.268YP/S [g/g]0.0130.0130.0330.052qSurfactin [g/(g\u2219h)]0.001*0.001*0.0050.006vol. qSurfactin [g/(L\u2219h)]0.003*0.003*0.0020.018*the values were calculated during the current study, using data of Chtioui et al. 2012 and Coutte et al. 2010 (mSurfactin, CDW, cultivation time and cultivation volume).Comparison of different foam-free Surfactin production processes regarding their process parameters and collation with a fermentation process applying foam fractionation [2].", "Summary of the process parameters of different foam-free processes", "Summary of the process parameters of different foam-free processes", "Summary of the process parameters of different foam-free processes", "Chtioui et al. \n2012 Coutte et al.\n2010 The current study Willenbacher et al. \n2014.", "Chtioui et al. \n2012 Coutte et al.\n2010 The current study Willenbacher et al. \n2014.", "Chtioui et al. \n2012 Coutte et al.\n2010 The current study Willenbacher et al. \n2014.", "Surfactin producer Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T.", "Surfactin producer Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T.", "Surfactin producer Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T.", "Fermentation approach Rotating discs Membrane bioreactor Anaerobic, no gas flow Foam fractionation.", "Fermentation approach Rotating discs Membrane bioreactor Anaerobic, no gas flow Foam fractionation.", "Fermentation approach Rotating discs Membrane bioreactor Anaerobic, no gas flow Foam fractionation.", "Cultivation time [h] 72 72 55 30.", "Cultivation time [h] 72 72 55 30.", "Cultivation time [h] 72 72 55 30.", "Max. cSurfactin [g/L] 0.212* 0.242* 0.087 3.995 (foam).", "Max. cSurfactin [g/L] 0.212* 0.242* 0.087 3.995 (foam).", "Max. cSurfactin [g/L] 0.212* 0.242* 0.087 3.995 (foam).", "YP/X [g/g] 0.068 0.078* 0.278 0.192.", "YP/X [g/g] 0.068 0.078* 0.278 0.192.", "YP/X [g/g] 0.068 0.078* 0.278 0.192.", "YX/S [g/g] 0.189 0.164* 0.120 0.268.", "YX/S [g/g] 0.189 0.164* 0.120 0.268.", "YX/S [g/g] 0.189 0.164* 0.120 0.268.", "YP/S [g/g] 0.013 0.013 0.033 0.052.", "YP/S [g/g] 0.013 0.013 0.033 0.052.", "YP/S [g/g] 0.013 0.013 0.033 0.052.", "qSurfactin [g/(g\u2219h)] 0.001* 0.001* 0.005 0.006.", "qSurfactin [g/(g\u2219h)] 0.001* 0.001* 0.005 0.006.", "qSurfactin [g/(g\u2219h)] 0.001* 0.001* 0.005 0.006.", "vol. qSurfactin [g/(L\u2219h)] 0.003* 0.003* 0.002 0.018.", "vol. qSurfactin [g/(L\u2219h)] 0.003* 0.003* 0.002 0.018.", "vol. qSurfactin [g/(L\u2219h)] 0.003* 0.003* 0.002 0.018.", "*the values were calculated during the current study, using data of Chtioui et al. 2012 and Coutte et al. 2010 (mSurfactin, CDW, cultivation time and cultivation volume).", "*the values were calculated during the current study, using data of Chtioui et al. 2012 and Coutte et al. 2010 (mSurfactin, CDW, cultivation time and cultivation volume).", "*the values were calculated during the current study, using data of Chtioui et al. 2012 and Coutte et al. 2010 (mSurfactin, CDW, cultivation time and cultivation volume).", "Comparison of different foam-free Surfactin production processes regarding their process parameters and collation with a fermentation process applying foam fractionation [2].", "Comparison of different foam-free Surfactin production processes regarding their process parameters and collation with a fermentation process applying foam fractionation [2].", "Comparison of different foam-free Surfactin production processes regarding their process parameters and collation with a fermentation process applying foam fractionation [2].", "The processes of Chtioui et al. and Coutte et al. each yielded above 0.2\u00a0g/L Surfactin.
