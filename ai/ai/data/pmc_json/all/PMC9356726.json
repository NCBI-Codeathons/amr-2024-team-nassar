["Abstract", "The antibiotic alaremycin has a structure that resembles that of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a universal precursor of porphyrins, and inhibits porphyrin biosynthesis. Genome sequencing of the alaremycin-producing bacterial strain and enzymatic analysis revealed that the first step of alaremcyin biosynthesis is catalysed by the enzyme, AlmA, which exhibits a high degree of similarity to 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) expressed by animals, protozoa, fungi, and \u03b1-proteobacteria. Site-directed mutagenesis of AlmA revealed that the substitution of two amino acids residues around the substrate binding pocket transformed its substrate specificity from that of alaremycin precursor synthesis to ALA synthesis. To estimate the evolutionary trajectory of AlmA and ALAS, we performed an ancestral sequence reconstitution analysis based on a phylogenetic tree of AlmA and ALAS. The reconstructed common ancestral enzyme of AlmA and ALAS exhibited alaremycin precursor synthetic activity, rather than ALA synthetic activity. These results suggest that ALAS evolved from an AlmA-like enzyme. We propose a new evolutionary hypothesis in which a non-essential secondary metabolic enzyme acts as an \u2018evolutionary seed\u2019 to generate an essential primary metabolic enzyme.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Antibiotics are substances produced by micro-organisms antagonistic to the growth of other micro-organisms.

In humans, ALAS catalyses the rate-limiting step for heme biosynthesis and its dysfunction is responsible for serious diseases, such as X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLPP) (Balwani 2019; Peoc\u2019h et al. 2019; Stojanovski et al. 2019).

This pathway includes three-step reactions beginning with glutamate (Nogaj and Beale 2005). Interestingly, the diversity of ALA biosynthetic pathways is in contrast to the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway wherein most steps are highly conserved among nearly all living organisms, although some procaryotes have been known to possess alternative pathways (Dailey et al. 2017).

This result clearly indicates that the hemA homologue is responsible for ALA synthesis in A012304 as with most bacteria. This is also supported by the observation that the A012304 genome contains a hemL gene, which is an essential component of the C5 pathway. Additionally, several genes involved in heme biosynthesis are also found downstream of the hemA homologue, that is, hemB, hemC, and hemD, which encode porphobilinogen synthase, porphobilinogen deaminase and uroporphyrinogen III synthase, respectively (fig. 2C). It was suggested that the ALAS homologue is involved in alaremycin biosynthesis. Notably, three serial genes were found downstream of the ALAS homologue, annotated as N-acetyltransferase, oxidoreductase and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, respectively (fig. 2D), which may be responsible for alaremycin biosynthesis together with the ALAS homologue. To test this, the gene cluster was introduced into E. coli JM109 and the ability of the cells to produce alaremycin was examined. As shown in fig. 2E, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by MS analysis revealed that the E. coli JM109 strain expressing these four genes produced alaremycin extracellularly. When the MFS transporter homologue was deleted, extracellular levels of alaremycin decreased, suggesting that it functions as an alaremycin exporter and may contribute to self-resistance. Conversely, E. coli strains expressing almA encoding the ALAS homologue and its downstream gene encoding N-acetyltransferase or almA did not produce alaremyicn. Based on these results, we concluded that almA and the two genes encoding N-acetyltransferase and oxidoreductase are required for alaremycin biosynthesis. The last gene encoding the MFS transporter is required for alaremycin extrusion. Accordingly, these four genes were designated almA, almB, almC, and almE (fig. 2D).", "Enzymatic Reaction Catalysed by AlmA", "Enzymatic Reaction Catalysed by AlmA", "Enzymatic Reaction Catalysed by AlmA", "In the biosynthetic pathway of alaremycin, it is expected that the AlmA catalyses the condensation of succinyl-CoA and amino acid.

AlmA was fused with a His-tag on its N-terminus, and the His-tagged AlmA protein was purified. Next, its enzymatic activity was measured using glycine, alanine, serine and threonine as a substrate (fig. 3AandB).

Regarding ancAlmA and CA, their Km values were smaller for serine than for glycine, whereas their kcat values were larger for serine than for glycine. Thus, the kcat/Km values for ancAlmA and CA indicate a greater catalytic efficiency for serine. The values for serine were 17\u2009\u00b1\u20095 and 82\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u2005s\u22121M\u22121, respectively, and those for glycine were 0.084\u2009\u00b1\u20090.015 and 0.44\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u2005s\u22121M\u22121, respectively. Therefore, ancAlmA and CA prefer serine to glycine as a substrate and efficiently produce intermediate I. Conversely, ancALAS exhibited catalytic activity only with glycine but not with serine. The kcat/Km value for glycine of ancALAS (0.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\u2005s\u22121M\u22121) was only 0.11% of that of RcALAS (150\u2009\u00b1\u200940\u2005s\u22121M\u22121), which resulted from a larger Km value and a smaller kcat value. High concentrations of RcALAS (2\u2005\u03bcM) showed a slight but significant activity using serine as a substrate, suggesting that RcALAS can synthesize intermediate I as a by-product (supplementary fig. S6, Supplementary Material online). The apparent specific activity for serine calculated from the initial reaction rate was 1.2\u2005\u03bcmol mg\u22121 h\u22121, which is 0.48% of that of AlmA for serine (Figs. 3B and 4D). However, the intermediate I production by RcALAS showed non-linearity probably because of product inhibition. We were unable to adopt the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation to determine the kinetic parameters of RcALAS with serine.", "We also performed a complementation test for MGHA01 to examine the in vivo activity of these reconstructed enzymes in vivo. The ancALAS restored the growth of MGHA01 on the M9 agar plate without ALA, whereas ancAlmA and CA did not (fig. 5D). Notably, ancAlmA and CA severely suppressed the growth of MGHA01 on the M9 ager plate even in the presence of ALA (fig. 5D). The growth recovery by ancALAS may be simply explained by its ALA synthetic activity. Meanwhile, severe growth inhibition by ancAlmA and CA probably resulted from the toxicity of intermediate I.

First, an ancestral bacterium having the C5 pathway acquired an AlmA-like enzyme as an antibiotic-synthesizing enzyme. Then, the ancestor of ALAS appeared from an AlmA-like enzyme through mutations that resulted in the loss of intermediate I synthetic activity while sustaining ALA synthetic activity, and thus an ancestral \u03b1-proteobacterial organism acquired ancestral ALAS. Afterwards, the ancestral \u03b1-proteobacteria lost the C5 pathway, whereas ancestral ALAS with low ALA synthetic activity was able to develop an efficient ALA synthetic enzyme through mutations and natural selection. Thereafter, ALAS may have been inherited to an ancestral eukaryotic organism via symbiosis, when ancestral eukaryotic organisms acquired mitochondria. This is based on reports that suggest that \u03b1-proteobacterial symbiosis is the origin of mitochondria (Zimorski et al. 2014; Roger et al. 2017) and human ALAS localizes within the mitochondria (Munakata et al. 2004; Nomura et al. 2021).
