["These authors contributed equally to this work.", "Abstract", "Over recent decades, the pipeline of antibiotics acting against Gram\u2010negative bacteria is running dry, as most discovered candidate antibiotics suffer from insufficient potency, pharmacokinetic properties, or toxicity. The darobactins, a promising new small peptide class of drug candidates, bind to novel antibiotic target BamA, an outer membrane protein. Previously, we reported that biosynthetic engineering in a heterologous host generated novel darobactins with enhanced antibacterial activity. Here we utilize an optimized purification method and present cryo\u2010EM structures of the Bam complex with darobactin 9 (D9), which served as a blueprint for the biotechnological generation of twenty new darobactins including halogenated analogs. The newly engineered darobactin 22 binds more tightly to BamA and outperforms the favorable activity profile of D9 against clinically relevant pathogens such as carbapenem\u2010resistant Acinetobacter baumannii up to 32\u2010fold, without observing toxic effects.", "Structural evaluation of the Bam complex with darobactin 9 using cryo\u2010EM combined with bioactivity evaluation led to biosynthetic engineering of novel derivatives with enhanced activity against Gram\u2010negative pathogens, including clinically relevant isolates. The currently most promising derivative darobactin 22 verified the structure and activity guided approach, exhibiting up to 128\u2010fold increased activity compared to natural darobactin A.", "C.

Alternatively, very recently published total syntheses reported for DA may be applicable but currently suffer from yield issues as well.[\n17\n, \n18\n]", "To summarize, our SAR approach presented structural knowledge about the MoB of the darobactins and resulted in novel derivatives with up to 32\u2010fold increased activity against CRAB, compared to the most potent known derivative D9.\n[19]\n The new, distinguished D22 was found to be comparable to clinically used antibiotics in its activity against certain Gram\u2010negative pathogens. Consequently, our approach led to a new frontrunner molecule of darobactins showing more favorable antibacterial activity. Compound D22 is particularly active against critically prioritized Gram\u2010negative pathogens encouraging further preclinical studies with this highly promising scaffold to hopefully and eventually achieve proof of efficacy in humans for this exciting and promising molecule class.", "To summarize, our SAR approach presented structural knowledge about the MoB of the darobactins and resulted in novel derivatives with up to 32\u2010fold increased activity against CRAB, compared to the most potent known derivative D9.\n[19]\n The new, distinguished D22 was found to be comparable to clinically used antibiotics in its activity against certain Gram\u2010negative pathogens.
