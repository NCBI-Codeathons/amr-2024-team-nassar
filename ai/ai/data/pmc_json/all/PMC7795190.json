["The development of new antibacterial drugs has become one of the most important tasks of the century in order to overcome the posing threat of drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria. Many antibiotics originate from natural products produced by various microorganisms. Over the last decades, bioinformatical approaches have facilitated the discovery and characterization of these small compounds using genome mining methodologies. A key part of this process is the identification of the most promising biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which encode novel natural products. In 2017, the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS) was developed in order to enable an automated target-directed genome mining approach. ARTS identifies possible resistant target genes within antibiotic gene clusters, in order to detect promising BGCs encoding antibiotics with novel modes of action. Although ARTS can predict promising targets based on multiple criteria, it provides little information about the cluster structures of possible resistant genes. Here, we present SYN-view. Based on a phylogenetic approach, SYN-view allows for easy comparison of gene clusters of interest and distinguishing genes with regular housekeeping functions from genes functioning as antibiotic resistant targets. Our aim is to implement our proposed method into the ARTS web-server, further improving the target-directed genome mining strategy of the ARTS pipeline.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "With the increasing number of drug-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial resistance has become a global health threat [1]. As the number of approved drugs have been decreasing over the past few decades, finding new compounds to feed the antibiotic discovery pipeline has become a crucial task [2]. Most of the antibiotics are derived from secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by fungal and bacterial organisms [3]. Many of these so-called natural products were found by labor-intensive methods such as screening biological samples for desired bioactivities. However, these traditional methods have been losing their efficiency, due to their high rediscovery rates [4]. Ever since the cost of DNA sequencing technologies has decreased substantially, in silico methods such as genome mining have gained an increased amount of popularity among researchers [5,6]. As a result, a number of computational tools such as antiSMASH [7] and PRISM [8] have been developed, in order to detect gene clusters encoding for natural products. The main approach of these tools is the identification of locally clustered groups of genes called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which are in conjunction responsible for the synthesis of secondary metabolites [9]. Using those BGC prediction tools, a large number of BGCs have been deposited in public databases. The newest version of Atlas of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) [10], the largest database containing predicted BGCs, contains roughly 400,000 clusters, from which less than 1% have been experimentally verified. This large discrepancy emphasizes the need for new and updated tools as well as the importance of prioritization of predicted BGCs for downstream processes. In order to address this issue, in 2017, Alanjary et al. developed the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS) [11] to detect most promising BGCs with potential new modes of action by automating the resistance based genome mining technique also called target directed genome mining. This approach is based on the notion that the antibiotic-producing bacteria have to be resistant to their own products [12]. Resistance genes can be encoded within the BGC of the respective compound. Additionally, in case of a resistance mechanism that is provided by a resistant target, this kind of genome mining method not only provides insights into the mode of action of the encoded antibiotics, but in turn also allows screening BGCs for natural products with promising and putatively novel targets [13]. ARTS links essential housekeeping genes to evolution driven events such as duplication, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), or co-localization within the BGC, which have been extensively shown to be the key processes in target-based strategies [14,15,16]. Although ARTS rapidly screens essential genes of an entire genome, the number of potential resistant targets can become quite large, especially when the BGC boundaries are set too far. In such cases, the distinction of a resistance gene and a regular housekeeping gene is hard to make. As stated by O\u2019Neill and his colleagues, inferring such distinctions may be possible, by comparing gene ortholog neighbors of the putative resistance genes and the context of the clusters they lie within in related organisms. Regular housekeeping genes often show synteny in their cluster structure, whereas the resistant target genes within antibiotic gene clusters are often only randomly present in closely related taxa [17]. Following up on this hypothesis, we analyzed the novobiocin producer Streptomyces niveus NCIMB 11891, with duplicated gyrB gene as known self-resistance mechanism, yielding a large number of false positives by an initial ARTS search shown in the first ARTS paper [11]. Visualized in Figure 1, the comparison of the neighborhoods of gene of interest (NGIs) to the NGIs from closely related organisms, clearly shows that the neighborhood of the housekeeping gene is almost identical, whereas the resistant target gene shows no orthologous genes in the neighborhood.", "With the increasing number of drug-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial resistance has become a global health threat [1].

Materials and Methods", "3. Materials and Methods", "Input Options and Workflow", "Input Options and Workflow", "Input Options and Workflow", "An overview of the workflow is illustrated in Figure 2. First, SYN-view needs an annotated genome file in GenBank format (gbff, gbk). Additionally, an HMM or protein fasta file for a gene/protein is required, which is used to either run hmmsearch [23] or blastp [23], against the input genome to find similar proteins. SYN-view uses default cut-off values for hmmsearch and blastp algorithms, which can be redefined by the user. Using Biopython [24], the input genome is parsed and per hit, a query NGI is created based on the proximity of the respective hit. By default, this proximity setting is three surrounding genes in both sides of the gene of interest; however, it can be changed to decrease/increase the size of the NGI. Finally, close relatives of the input genome must be set, for the synteny search. For this purpose, the user can either provide the result file of an autoMLST job (mash_distances.txt, recommended) or provide a custom folder with specified genomes in GenBank format. If an autoMLST result is provided, the 10 closest organisms are, by default, downloaded from NCBIs RefSeq database [25]. As stated earlier, increasing the number of closest organisms would also increase the quality of the result. For the purposes of speed, it was set as 10 for default but can be changed via command line arguments. After downloading genomes, the next part of the SYN-view pipeline is detecting the input protein sequences from given genome, creating query NGIs. Afterwards, a database is created, containing only the NGIs from the closest relatives based on the input protein. The NGIs of the input are then blasted against the database and the NGI hits are scored by cumulative blast bit score. Higher bit scores suggest higher sequence similarity, while being independent of the database size. Therefore, summing over all individual bit scores of a NGI gives an indication of the sequence similarity of the whole NGI with respect to the query. In the results folder, all NGI hits per query can be analyzed using the corresponding visualization as an svg file as explained in Supplementary Results and can be compared to other hits using a standard web browser (Figure 1).
