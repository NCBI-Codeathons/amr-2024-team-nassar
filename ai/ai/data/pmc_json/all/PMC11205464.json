["Streptomyces species are attractive sources of secondary metabolites that serve as major sources of antibiotics and other drugs. In this study, genome mining was used to determine the biosynthetic potential of Streptomyces sp. 21So2-11 isolated from Antarctic soil. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that this strain is most closely related to Streptomyces drozdowiczii NBRC 101007T, with a similarity of 98.02%. Genome comparisons based on average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH) showed that strain 21So2-11 represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces. In addition to a large number of genes related to environmental adaptation and ecological function, a total of 28 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for the biosynthesis of known and/or novel secondary metabolites, including terpenes, lantipeptides, polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, RiPPs and siderophores, were detected in the genome of strain 21So2-11. In addition, a total of 1456 BGCs were predicted to contribute to the biosynthesis of more than 300 secondary metabolites based on the genomes of 47 Streptomyces strains originating from polar regions. The results indicate the potential of Streptomyces sp. 21So2-11 for bioactive secondary metabolite production and are helpful for understanding bacterial adaptability and ecological function in cold terrestrial environments.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Actinomycetes are known for their potential to synthesize bioactive secondary metabolites (also known as natural products) that serve as major sources of agricultural and medical drugs, such as antibiotics and antifungal, antitumor, antiviral, antiparasitic, and immunosuppressive compounds [1,2], accounting for approximately 45% of the secondary metabolites of microbial origin [3]. The genus Streptomyces is considered the most effective producer of bioactive natural products widely used in clinical practice, such as streptomycin, kanamycin and vancomycin [4]. To date, more than 70% of currently known natural antibiotics from microorganisms are produced by Streptomyces species [5,6,7]. However, with the isolation of a large number of secondary metabolites, the probability of finding antibiotics with significant biological activity and novel structures from Streptomyces is decreased [8,9]. This has led to a shift in focus to unexplored, underexploited and/or extreme habitats for isolating novel actinobacteria, particularly novel Streptomyces species [10]. In addition, the development of new genetic tools and fermentation strategies is pursued to facilitate natural product discovery in the genus Streptomyces [11].", "Actinomycetes are known for their potential to synthesize bioactive secondary metabolites (also known as natural products) that serve as major sources of agricultural and medical drugs, such as antibiotics and antifungal, antitumor, antiviral, antiparasitic, and immunosuppressive compounds [1,2], accounting for approximately 45% of the secondary metabolites of microbial origin [3].
