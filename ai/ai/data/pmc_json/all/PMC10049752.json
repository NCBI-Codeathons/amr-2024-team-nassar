For instance, the majority of known antibiotics and biologically active SMs are derived from the Streptomyces (de Lima Proc\u00f3pio et al. 2012), while thousands of SM biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have been identified in other bacteria (Skinnider et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2021). IMG-ABC, the largest BGC database accessible to the public, stores hundreds of thousands of predicted clusters (Palaniappan et al. 2020). As a result of the explosion of a large amount of BGC data, the prioritization of biologically active clusters for experimental characterization became a challenge. Genome mining has identified a subset of human microbial-derived SM BGCs with essential functional activities (Donia et al. 2014).
