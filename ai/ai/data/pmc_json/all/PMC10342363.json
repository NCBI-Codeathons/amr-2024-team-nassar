["Filamentous fungi are one of the most important producers of secondary metabolites. Some of them can have a toxic effect on the human body, leading to diseases. On the other hand, they are widely used as pharmaceutically significant drugs, such as antibiotics, statins, and immunosuppressants. A single fungus species in response to various signals can produce 100 or more secondary metabolites. Such signaling is possible due to the coordinated regulation of several dozen biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which are mosaically localized in different regions of fungal chromosomes. Their regulation includes several levels, from pathway-specific regulators, whose genes are localized inside BGCs, to global regulators of the cell (taking into account changes in pH, carbon consumption, etc.) and global regulators of secondary metabolism (affecting epigenetic changes driven by velvet family proteins, LaeA, etc.). In addition, various low-molecular-weight substances can have a mediating effect on such regulatory processes. This review is devoted to a critical analysis of the available data on the \u201cturning on\u201d and \u201coff\u201d of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in response to signals in filamentous fungi. To describe the ongoing processes, the model of \u201cpiano regulation\u201d is proposed, whereby pressing a certain key (signal) leads to the extraction of a certain sound from the \u201cmusical instrument of the fungus cell\u201d, which is expressed in the production of a specific secondary metabolite.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The production of secondary metabolites (SMs) is one of the most prominent biochemical attributes of filamentous fungi (or moldy fungi, or molds), and has stimulated extensive research on these microorganisms since the 1950s [1,2,3]. As a result of this, numerous compounds have been discovered, some of which are capable of harming human health, while others are able to heal people [4,5,6,7]. In parallel with the emergence of new knowledge about the effects of these low-molecular-weight compounds on the human body and the deciphering of their structures, investigations have been carried out that aim to study the mechanism of action at the cellular level [8]. For example, targets for the main classes of antibiotics have been identified, and the mechanisms for the emergence of resistance in microorganisms against these drugs have been established [9,10,11,12,13,14]. In the late 1980s, in light of the emergence of the era of genetic engineering, the molecular basis of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites began to be studied [15]. In particular, the so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for the biosynthesis of the corresponding SMs were discovered [16,17]. This knowledge made it possible to apply the strategy of reverse genetics, i.e., going from gene to trait/phenotype, and search for an appropriate product for \u201csilent\u201d or so-called \u201corphan\u201d BGCs [18,19,20]. Currently, there are various techniques for such genome-mining of BGCs [15,21,22,23,24,25]. Emerging knowledge about biosynthetic gene clusters for the production of secondary metabolites, as well as a lot of difficulties associated with the \u201cawakening\u201d of silent BGCs, have led to the understanding, in numerous studies, of the existence of a complex regulatory system for them [26,27,28,29]. Such regulation operates in concert at several levels, starting with cluster-specific regulators, transcription factors whose genes cluster within a particular BGC and regulate the expression of the same BGC, ending with global regulators and chromatin-mediated regulation [30,31,32,33]. Due to the presence of such a system of regulation, there is a relationship between the production of SMs and the development of fungi [34]. The production of the corresponding SMs occurs at certain stages of the development of the fungus; for example, the synthesis of pigments occurs after the transition from the growth phase (trophophase) to the production phase (idiophase) [35]. On the other hand, most fungal BGCs are silent under normal physiological conditions and begin to work after receiving an appropriate environmental signal that affects the regulatory system [36,37,38]. Composite pleiotropic events accompanying the functioning of the fungal secondary metabolism are currently being studied using complex, including multi-omics, approaches [39,40,41].", "The production of secondary metabolites (SMs) is one of the most prominent biochemical attributes of filamentous fungi (or moldy fungi, or molds), and has stimulated extensive research on these microorganisms since the 1950s [1,2,3].

A typical NRPS module consists of: (i) the adenylation (A) domain, for amino acid recognition and activation; (ii) the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain, for transferring an activated amino acid from the A-domain to its cofactor, 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine; and (iii) the condensation (C) domain, to catalyze peptide bond formation [177]. Along with this, the module may contain a set of optional domains with catalytic functions of methyltransferase (MT), \u03b2-ketoacyl reductase (KR), epimerase (E), etc. [178].

For example, in A. chrysogenum, the early BGC beta-lactam cluster contains a gene for the CefR regulator, which is both a negative regulator for the cefT transporter gene from the early BGC and a positive regulator for the cefEF biosynthetic gene from the late BGC [250]. Thus, CefR from the early BGC beta-lactam cluster is a pathway-specific regulator for cefT, and a cross-cluster regulator for cefEF. Such a differential effect of CefR on the expression of beta-lactam BGCs in A. chrysogenum allows, on the one hand, the biosynthesis of CPC to be intensified (as a result of upregulation of one of the key biosynthetic genes), and on the other hand, for a reduction in the \u201cleakage\u201d of intermediates from the cell (such as IPN, PenN, DAOC, and DAC) and their redirection toward producing the target metabolite, CPC.", "5. Methods for Improving Fungal Strains for the Production of Secondary Metabolites", "5. Methods for Improving Fungal Strains for the Production of Secondary Metabolites", "Natural fungal isolates, the so-called wild-type (WT) strains, produce a limited amount of the target SM, which is insufficient for industrial production. In this regard, over the past 70\u201380 years, improved high-yield (HY) producers have been created, in which the yield of the target SM is increased by 100\u20131000 or more times. There are two principal approaches to improve the production of SMs in fungal strains: (i) an approach using genetic and metabolic engineering methods to introduce targeted changes in the resulting recombinant strains [50,251,252], and (ii) so-called classical strain improvement (CSI) based on random mutagenesis and subsequent screening of the resulting mutants with improved production of target SMs [253]. Currently, all industrial fungal producers of SMs have been obtained using CSI programs, or as a result of modifications introduced into CSI strains [253] (Figure 4). The essence of CSI programs is that a mutagenic effect is applied to the natural producer of a promising SM. Various agents are used for this, such as chemical mutagens, UV, and irradiation. A sublethal dose of mutagenic effects is selected; the obtained clones are screened according to the level of production of the target SM. Typically, most clones show similar or lower activity; however, there are clones that have higher activity than the WT strain. The most active clone is used for a new mutagenic effect (second round of mutagenesis); the obtained clones are screened, and among them, the most active one is selected. This process is repeated several dozen times, which leads to a multiple-fold increase in the production of the target SM. Along with the increase in production, concomitant mutations accumulate. Therefore, strains improved in this way usually have lower viability than WT strains. This can be expressed as a slowdown in the growth rate, a decrease in the size of the colonies on agar media, a decrease in biomass during submerged cultivation, an increase in stress resistance, and many other complications [223,254,255]. As a result, after several tens of rounds of mutagenesis, a stage begins whereby, after the next mutagenic effect, it is no longer possible to obtain more active clones. This stage corresponds to the technological limit of the method. For industrial production, a strain obtained at the last or one of the penultimate stages of mutagenesis is used (if the strain obtained at the last stage is not viable enough for biotechnological application).", "Natural fungal isolates, the so-called wild-type (WT) strains, produce a limited amount of the target SM, which is insufficient for industrial production.

In particular, the overexpression of laeA in Aspergillus niger FGSC A1279 resulted in the upregulation of 281 putative secondary metabolite genes, including 22 backbone genes of BGCs [315]. The deletion of velA in the CSI-strains P. chrysogenum P2niaD18 and A. chrysogenum A3/2 led to a change in expression in both strains of approximately 50% secondary metabolite cluster genes, including \u03b2-lactam biosynthesis genes [57]. Without a regulation system, all sounds begin to sound simultaneously, while an HY strain should have only one sound, emitted by pressing the necessary key for the production of the required SM. Therefore, it is also necessary to break all the other keys of the keyboard, so that only one key remains, emitting the sound that is correct from the point of view of industrial fermentation. And this is exactly how (against the biosynthesis of alternative SMs) selection is directed in CSI programs, since one of the most important types of mutations selected during classical improvement turns out to be deletions in the backbone genes of alternative BGCs.", "From the point of view of the piano model, in order to create an industrial HY strain, it is necessary to greatly modify a perfectly created piano for the finely tuned regulation of SMs in natural conditions (the extraction of various sounds) (Figure 7). It is required to eliminate the control of the signal-dependent regulatory system, since it is not desirable for an industrial strain to depend on any environmental signals. First of all, it is necessary to break the fallboard and keyboard cover (make mutations in the secondary metabolism regulation system at the epigenetic level).

One notable example is aliphatic polyamines, which upregulate laeA, target biosynthetic genes, and the production of target SMs in the CSI-strains P. chrysogenum Wisconsin 54-1255 and A. terreus 43-16 [44,301]. Such an effect can be associated with pressing the forte pedal (right pedal), which serves to lengthen the sounds and raises all dampers at once, so that after the key is released, the corresponding strings continue to sound. One explanation for their effects is related to the consumption of a common substrate, S-adenosine methionine (SAMe), which is required both for aminopropylation in the biosynthesis of polyamines and for the work of LaeA, a histone methylase. Using the example of A. chrysogenum RNCM 408D, it was shown that during a CSI program, the content of polyamines in a cell can be significantly increased [316]. This could be due to concomitant mutations selected at the sublethal level, since polyamines are able to protect the cell from peroxide stress and participate in the repair of DNA breaks in combination with RAD51 recombinase [317,318,319]. And the addition of exogenous polyamines during the fermentation process via a feedback mechanism inhibits their endogenous synthesis, which releases part of SAMe for the purpose of methylation and the work of LaeA. However, in specially designed genetically engineered strains or on specially selected nutrient media, the addition of polyamines can lead to a decrease in target production [169,244].

(a) Under initial physiological conditions, SMs are not synthesized in the fungal cell (the piano does not make sound). The biosynthetic gene clusters, BGCs (piano keys), required for the production of SMs, are located in the heterochromatin regions and are inaccessible for gene expression (the piano keys are not available for pressing), since there is no activation by epigenetic global regulators of SMs capable of transferring the BGC loci to the euchromatin state (the fallboard is closed). There is also no activation from the side of the global regulators of the cell (the music stand is closed), as well as cross-cluster and path-specific controls (the piano lid is closed). Since there is no sound (SM biosynthesis), this process is not affected by mediators (pressing the piano pedals).

The microorganism is at the trophophase stage, since the colony is unstained and the synthesis of secondary pigment metabolites has not yet occurred. (b) For SM biosynthesis by a fungal cell, after receiving an appropriate signal (for example, a pianist with sheet music has arrived), the epigenetic regulatory system transfers the corresponding BGC loci from the heterochromatic state to the euchromatic state (the piano lid opens). This opens the possibility for gene expression of the corresponding cluster (the ability to press the piano keys). However, gene expression is also controlled by global cell regulators (the pianist opens the music stand and sheet music is placed on it, which determines the order in which the keys are pressed), as well as cross-cluster and path-specific controls (opening the piano lid). All of this leads to pressing a specific key (BGC), which leads to the appearance of the sound corresponding to it (synthesis of the target secondary metabolite). The sound of a single key can be changed, for example, by pressing the forte or piano pedal (also, the complex effect of mediators can increase or, conversely, reduce the production of the target SM).

(b) For SM biosynthesis by a fungal cell, after receiving an appropriate signal (for example, a pianist with sheet music has arrived), the epigenetic regulatory system transfers the corresponding BGC loci from the heterochromatic state to the euchromatic state (the piano lid opens). This opens the possibility for gene expression of the corresponding cluster (the ability to press the piano keys). However, gene expression is also controlled by global cell regulators (the pianist opens the music stand and sheet music is placed on it, which determines the order in which the keys are pressed), as well as cross-cluster and path-specific controls (opening the piano lid). All of this leads to pressing a specific key (BGC), which leads to the appearance of the sound corresponding to it (synthesis of the target secondary metabolite). The sound of a single key can be changed, for example, by pressing the forte or piano pedal (also, the complex effect of mediators can increase or, conversely, reduce the production of the target SM). The background of the figure is filled with a photograph of a colony of P. chrysogenum STG-117 after cultivation on CDA medium for 12 days at 26 \u00b0C. The appearance of a characteristic pigment associated with the biosynthesis of chrysogine and sorbicillin SMs indicates the transition of the microorganism to the idiophase, which is coproduced through the synthesis of SMs.", "Figure 7Localization of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for the production of secondary metabolites (SMs) on the chromosomes of Penicillium chrysogenum.
