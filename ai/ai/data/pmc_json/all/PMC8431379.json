["Cancer is one of the primary causes of worldwide human deaths. Most cancer patients receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but these treatments are usually only partially efficacious and lead to a variety of serious side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new therapeutic strategies. The emergence of nanotechnology has had a profound impact on general clinical treatment. The application of nanotechnology has facilitated the development of nano-drug delivery systems (NDDSs) that are highly tumor selective and allow for the slow release of active anticancer drugs. In recent years, vehicles such as liposomes, dendrimers and polymer nanomaterials have been considered promising carriers for tumor-specific drug delivery, reducing toxicity and improving biocompatibility. Among them, polymer nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the most innovative methods of non-invasive drug delivery. Here, we review the application of polymer NPs in drug delivery, gene therapy, and early diagnostics for cancer therapy.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Cancer is still the second leading cause of death globally, and its death toll exceeds the combined deaths from human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and malaria [1,2,3,4]. In 2020, GLOBOCAN estimated that 19.3 million new cancer cases and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths occurred worldwide [5,6]. Cancer includes a series of diseases caused by the uncontrolled growth of malignant cells, which may invade or spread to other parts of the body [7,8]. Thus far, many strategies have been developed for cancer treatment, including surgery [9,10], radiation therapy [11,12,13], chemotherapy [14,15,16,17], targeted therapy [18,19,20], hormonal therapy [21,22], and immunotherapy [23,24], or a combination of these options [25,26]. As a result of all these treatments, the incidence of cancer has declined slightly over the past decade.", "Cancer is still the second leading cause of death globally, and its death toll exceeds the combined deaths from human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and malaria [1,2,3,4].

Chemotherapy is mainly achieved by using chemotherapeutic drugs to kill cancer cells [35,36]. As a means of systemic treatment, the drug often circulates throughout most of the organs and tissues of the body with the blood, which can cause damage to other healthy tissues and organs [37,38]. However, chemotherapy has a reliable effect on some tumors that tend to spread throughout the body and on metastatic tumors [39,40,41]. The classic chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin (Dox) [42], vemurafenib [43], and paclitaxel (PTX) [44]) are still the mainstay of current treatment, but they are limited by narrow treatment indicators, significant toxicity, and frequent acquired drug resistance. Traditional chemotherapy interferes with DNA synthesis and mitosis, leading to the death of fast-growing and dividing cancer cells [16,45,46]; however, these drugs are non-selective and can damage healthy normal tissues, causing serious complications and undesirable side effects, such as loss of appetite and nausea. In fact, the severe adverse effects of chemotherapy drugs on healthy tissues and organs are the main reason for the high mortality of cancer patients.", "However, traditional therapies are only effective for some early malignant tumors [27,28,29], and the main reasons for eventual failure of tumor treatment are metastasis [30], recurrence [31], heterogeneity [32], chemotherapy resistance [33], and avoidance of immune surveillance [34].

Targeted chemotherapy mainly uses molecular targeted drugs to block specific molecules and metabolic pathways in tumor cell growth and proliferation. Compared to other types of cancer treatments, targeted therapy can achieve the greatest therapeutic effect and lowest toxicity. In particular, the more targeted the drug, the lower the possibility of drug resistance. The clinical success of immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of a variety of advanced malignant tumors [51,52]. However, most patients do not benefit from existing immunotherapies, and many patients experience immune-related adverse events [53]. It is generally believed that the development of new anticancer drugs has greatly improved the survival and quality of life of cancer patients. However, in many cases, these drugs show a good response during initial treatment, but later on in the treatment, the efficacy of the drugs decreases and can lead to cancer recurrence. This phenomenon is called acquired drug resistance and is a major problem in the treatment of cancer [54,55,56]. The formation of drug resistance is mainly due to a kind of internal resistance that develops within tumor cells [57,58,59]. A specific cell membrane transporter changes the drug transport and pumps the drug out of tumor cells [60]. In addition, the gradual acquisition of specific heredity and epigenetics in cancer cells during the treatment process greatly contributes to acquired drug resistance [54]. Drug resistance is defined as a decline in the efficacy and potency of a drug in order to limit treatment, ultimately leading to failure in the treatment of the disease [61]. Tumors such as kidney cancer [62], hepatocellular carcinoma [63], and malignant melanoma [64] often respond well to chemotherapy in the early stage, but become unresponsive in later stages of treatment due to the development of acquired drug resistance.", "Further research into the pathogenesis of cancer has led to new treatment options, including targeted therapy [47,48] and immunotherapy [49,50].

In recent years, the surface characteristics of NPs have been identified as important factors in determining their lifetime and fate, and are related to their capture by macrophages during the cycling process [98,99]. Ideally, NPs with a hydrophilic surface can more easily escape capture by macrophages. At present, the surface of NPs is generally modified, for example by coating the surface of NPs with hydrophilic polymers (such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)) to prevent the formation of a proteins corona in order to extend the circulation period of NPs in vivo [100,101,102].

The strategy of functionalizing NPs with PEG or PEGylation is mainly derived from the observation that the circulatory life of NPs is low after intravascular administration [104]. PEGylation involves grafting PEG onto the surface of NPs, where ethylene glycol units are closely associated with water molecules to form a moisturizing layer [105].

When the cell membrane surface was functionalized, amount of protein (IgG and albumin) adsorbed on the particle surface was reduced by over 10-fold [108]. Therefore, this biomimetic coating strategy significantly reduced the uptake of particles by macrophages, especially when the coating originated from the same donor species.

First, dextran reacts with the monomer methyl-acrylate under the catalysis of cerium ammonium nitrate, and then the crosslinking agent diallyl-disulfide is added to form a new type of nanocarrier [159]. Finally, Dox is covalently bonded to the nanocarrier through a hydrazone bond. This novel drug delivery system not only has a high drug loading capacity and pH sensitivity, but can also reduce cell resistance. The emergence of multidrug resistance in cancer treatment is a huge challenge that limits drug efficacy, thus leading to the failure of many chemotherapy drugs in clinical treatment. As far as polymer NPs are concerned, Cuvier et al. [160], Nemati et al. [161], and Verdi\u00e8re et al.

In 1997, Verdi\u00e8re et al. used Dox-loaded PACA NPs to overcome multidrug resistance in vitro. They found that the main reason for PACA NPs\u2019 ability to reverse multidrug resistance was that the NPs adsorbed onto the surface of tumor cells and then released their coated drugs, thereby forming a local highly concentrated gradient drug concentration around the tumor cells. At the same time, the degradation and release of polycyanoacrylic acid and other compounds by NPs may have interacted with Dox, which may have promoted the accumulation of Dox in tumor cells by overcoming the transmembrane potential. Moreover, Vlerken et al. found that polymer NPs can be used to modulate intracellular ceramide to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer [163]. In 2015, Yuan et al. proposed self-assembled nanodrugs in cells as a new strategy for overcoming multidrug resistance [164]. They designed a taxol derivative (Ac-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-Cys(StBu)-Lys(taxol)-2-cyanobenzothiazole (CBT-Taxol)) through a biocompatible condensation reaction. The results showed that the lethality of CBT-Taxol to taxol-resistant HCT 116 cancer cells was significantly higher than that of free taxol. Furthermore, CBT-Taxol had a more lasting effect on tubulin condensation, possibly due to its ability to slowly release taxol in tumor cells. Therefore, the construction of intracellular self-assembled nanodrugs may be a new and optimal strategy to overcome drug resistance. At present, many NP-based drug delivery systems have been developed to overcome drug resistance by increasing cell uptake and rapid drug release to increase the intracellular drug concentration. Wang et al. designed a polypeptide dendritic copolymer NP to encapsulate and target Dox and to overcome multidrug resistance by regulating the lysosomal pathway of breast cancer cell apoptosis [165].

As a targeting ligand, folic acid could improve the uptake efficiency of NPs by multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells. In addition, these NPs showed excellent P-shRNA release ability in cells, and effectively silenced the expression of the target gene P-gp, thereby reducing the multidrug resistance to the PTX.

Gene Therapy Based on Polymer Nanocarriers", "Gene therapy is a technology that treats or cures diseases by modifying a person\u2019s genes. Gene therapy can work through the following mechanisms: (i) replacing disease-causing genes with healthy genes; (ii) inactivating disease-causing genes; (iii) introducing new or modified genes into the body to help treat diseases [168,169]. There are many types of gene therapy products, including plasmid DNA, viral vectors, bacterial vectors, gene editing technology, and patient-derived cell gene therapy products [170]. Among them, gene editing refers to the process of making tiny, controllable changes to the DNA of organisms, mainly using the CRISPR/Cas9 method [171]. Although advances have been made in various nucleotide-based therapies, the low efficiency of targeted tissue or cell delivery has limited the clinical application of gene therapy [172]. In the blood circulation, small nucleic acid molecules are easily degraded by enzymes in plasma.

Gao et al. have also found that, in the extracellular environment, the half-life of naked small nucleic acid molecules ranges from a few minutes to a few hours, so they cannot be enriched in large amounts to target cells, thereby reducing the bioavailability of the drug and leading to poor efficacy [173].

Compared to viral vectors, nanocarriers not only have good biosafety but can also deliver gene agents to target cells with high efficiency [178]. In addition, NDDSs can maintain their functions while improving the bioavailability of drugs and reducing off-target effects. Among existing nanocarriers, polymer nanocarriers are attracting a great deal of attention due to their non-toxicity, low immunogenicity, and high biocompatibility. RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising technique for regulating tumor genes in cancer therapy [179]. Effective cancer treatment using RNAi requires efficient delivery of siRNA and silencing of target genes in cancer cells. NDDSs are a relatively convenient way to deliver therapeutic siRNA to solid tumors, including tumor metastasis. However, there are multiple obstacles to delivering therapeutic siRNA to the cytoplasm of cancer cells. To overcome the challenges of current siRNA delivery vehicles, researchers have designed many interesting and increasingly complete drug delivery systems. Johan et al. prepared poly(\u03b2-amino ester)s (PBAE) through a two-step method and designed a bioreducible PBAE\u2013siRNA NP for the systematic delivery of siRNA in vivo to brain tumors [180]. NPs based on PBAE have high in vitro permeability, and the positively charged surface improves siRNA loading efficiency and can remain stable in the presence of serum proteins. In addition, the diameter of PBAE NPs is approximately 57 nm, small enough to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) to reach the glioma site and specifically inhibit the expression of target genes. Li et al. reported a dual supramolecular nanocomposite composed of \u03b1-cyclodextrin-modified hyaluronic acid and an azobenzene-modified diphenylalanine derivative with a positively charged imidazole group [181]. Such nanocarriers can bind to siRNA through electrostatic interactions, and effectively deliver them to cancer cells in order to inhibit their growth. In addition, the azobenzene double bonds of NDDs are isomerized under ultraviolet radiation (365 nm), resulting in the disintegration of the NPs to release siRNA, while showing good cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. Li et al. believed that a new drug delivery system was expected to overcome the shortcomings of the high-density positive charges of gene transfection reagents, damaging the membranes and cells of normal cells, thereby providing a promising method for gene delivery.

Combination Therapy Based on Polymer Nanocarriers", "Cancer is a complex disease driven by multiple gene mutations, and its progression involves interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment [213]. Compared to single-agent therapy, combination chemotherapy has shown better clinical treatment effects, especially in delaying the development of cancer chemotherapy resistance [214,215]. Studies have found that cancer cells acquire defense mechanisms by over-expressing drug efflux pumps, increasing drug metabolism, enhancing self-repair capabilities, or expressing altered drug targets, resulting in reduced efficacy and, ultimately, failure of treatment [61]. In order to solve this problem, the use of two or more drugs with different pharmacological mechanisms for combined therapy is a promising treatment strategy (Table 4). For example, in vivo efficacy of dual-drug-loaded NPs was better than that of a single formulation of combretastatin and Dox in mice with B16/F10 melanoma or Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing mice [216]. Currently, various nanodrug delivery systems, such as liposomes and polymer NPs, are used to provide multiple treatments at the same time, including chemotherapeutics, siRNA/mRNA, immunoagonists, photosensitizers, and antiangiogenic agents [217]. In this regard, many polymer NPs have been widely used in the treatment of various cancers. Their advantages are mainly reflected in the prolonged drug half-life, high drug loading rate, low toxicity, controlled release, and specific enrichment. In addition, an important advantage of polymer nanocarriers is that drugs with different physical and chemical properties can be co-encapsulated in the same nanocarrier and delivered to tumor cells simultaneously to achieve combined therapy [218]. In our previous research, we reported the self-assembled polymer nanocarrier-mediated co-delivery of metformin and Dox for the treatment of melanoma [111]. We mainly used folic acid\u2013sodium alginate\u2013cholesteric amphoteric polymer NPs to co-deliver metformin and Dox to melanoma tissues, and to inhibit tumor progression by inducing PANoptosis (pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis) of melanoma cells (Figure 2). To ensure effective drug release in the target tissue in an ideal manner, several strategies have been developed involving introducing stimulus responsiveness into polymer NPs, giving them a specific ability to change their structure or chemical composition in response to slight changes in the environment, which then triggers drug release. Guo et al. designed a dual-pH responsive biopolymer\u2013Dox conjugate NP to encapsulate lapatinib [219]. In an acidic tumor environment, the surface charge conversion of NPs can be triggered, and the uptake of drug-loaded NPs and the release of drugs can be promoted by tumor cells. This is expected to have an improved therapeutic effect on breast cancer. In addition to pH-sensitive nanocarriers, Liu and his collaborators successfully prepared and modified glutathione (GSH)-responsive Fe-DSCP NPs constructed from Fe3+ and the cisplatin prodrug (DSCP) [220]. This cRGD-conjugated Fe-DSCP-PEG NP (Fe-DSCP-PEG\u2013cRGD) can be used as a tumor-specific therapeutic drug for the combined therapy of targeted chemotherapy and chemotherapy kinetics. In addition, researchers have found that biomimetic NPs have great potential in combination therapy. Wang et al. proposed that the use of erythrocyte cell membranes to disguise NPs could efficiently deliver photosensitizers and pro-hypoxic drugs in combined tumor therapy [221]. Similarly, Cong Xu et al. developed a biomimetic dual-drug delivery system (Si/PNPs@HeLa) that simultaneously targeted the delivery of PTX and siRNA by camouflaging HeLa cell membranes onto siRNA/PTX co-loaded PLGA NPs [222]. In summary, we have reason to believe that combined therapy mediated by nanodrug delivery systems will bring about a new dawn for the personalized treatment of tumors.", "Cancer is a complex disease driven by multiple gene mutations, and its progression involves interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment [213].

In our previous research, we reported the self-assembled polymer nanocarrier-mediated co-delivery of metformin and Dox for the treatment of melanoma [111]. We mainly used folic acid\u2013sodium alginate\u2013cholesteric amphoteric polymer NPs to co-deliver metformin and Dox to melanoma tissues, and to inhibit tumor progression by inducing PANoptosis (pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis) of melanoma cells (Figure 2). To ensure effective drug release in the target tissue in an ideal manner, several strategies have been developed involving introducing stimulus responsiveness into polymer NPs, giving them a specific ability to change their structure or chemical composition in response to slight changes in the environment, which then triggers drug release. Guo et al. designed a dual-pH responsive biopolymer\u2013Dox conjugate NP to encapsulate lapatinib [219]. In an acidic tumor environment, the surface charge conversion of NPs can be triggered, and the uptake of drug-loaded NPs and the release of drugs can be promoted by tumor cells. This is expected to have an improved therapeutic effect on breast cancer. In addition to pH-sensitive nanocarriers, Liu and his collaborators successfully prepared and modified glutathione (GSH)-responsive Fe-DSCP NPs constructed from Fe3+ and the cisplatin prodrug (DSCP) [220]. This cRGD-conjugated Fe-DSCP-PEG NP (Fe-DSCP-PEG\u2013cRGD) can be used as a tumor-specific therapeutic drug for the combined therapy of targeted chemotherapy and chemotherapy kinetics. In addition, researchers have found that biomimetic NPs have great potential in combination therapy. Wang et al. proposed that the use of erythrocyte cell membranes to disguise NPs could efficiently deliver photosensitizers and pro-hypoxic drugs in combined tumor therapy [221]. Similarly, Cong Xu et al. developed a biomimetic dual-drug delivery system (Si/PNPs@HeLa) that simultaneously targeted the delivery of PTX and siRNA by camouflaging HeLa cell membranes onto siRNA/PTX co-loaded PLGA NPs [222]. In summary, we have reason to believe that combined therapy mediated by nanodrug delivery systems will bring about a new dawn for the personalized treatment of tumors.", "Cancer is a complex disease driven by multiple gene mutations, and its progression involves interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment [213]. Compared to single-agent therapy, combination chemotherapy has shown better clinical treatment effects, especially in delaying the development of cancer chemotherapy resistance [214,215]. Studies have found that cancer cells acquire defense mechanisms by over-expressing drug efflux pumps, increasing drug metabolism, enhancing self-repair capabilities, or expressing altered drug targets, resulting in reduced efficacy and, ultimately, failure of treatment [61]. In order to solve this problem, the use of two or more drugs with different pharmacological mechanisms for combined therapy is a promising treatment strategy (Table 4). For example, in vivo efficacy of dual-drug-loaded NPs was better than that of a single formulation of combretastatin and Dox in mice with B16/F10 melanoma or Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing mice [216]. Currently, various nanodrug delivery systems, such as liposomes and polymer NPs, are used to provide multiple treatments at the same time, including chemotherapeutics, siRNA/mRNA, immunoagonists, photosensitizers, and antiangiogenic agents [217]. In this regard, many polymer NPs have been widely used in the treatment of various cancers. Their advantages are mainly reflected in the prolonged drug half-life, high drug loading rate, low toxicity, controlled release, and specific enrichment.

Conclusions", "Recent studies on NDDSs have shown that, compared to traditional chemotherapy or immunotherapy, these systems have great advantages in targeted drug delivery. Moreover, the unique physical and chemical properties of NP drug carriers make them very suitable for tumor therapy [86,227]. However, despite many efforts in the development of new targeted nanocarriers (including organic polymers and mixed systems with inorganic materials such as gold, silver, and silicon oxide), only a few nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use [228]. This phenomenon may be due to the lack of non-specific distribution and the accumulation of targeted NPs after administration, and concerns about their safety. In order to fully evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of NP therapy, more clinical data are needed, which also helps to optimize the development of nanomedicines. In this paper, we summarized the application of polymer nanodrug delivery systems in tumor treatment. Compared to other systems, this type of drug delivery system contains highlights such as its unique high drug loading efficiency and targeting ability. Safety issues are key to designing an optimal NDDS.

Especially in cancer treatment, early detection of growing tumor cells is crucial, and determines the success or failure of the treatment [230]. Nano imaging agent-based fluorescence imaging is an easy diagnostic technique which provides high spatial and temporal resolution, excellent sensitivity and good selectivity [231,232]. Therefore, without the need for anatomic intervention, such as the use of an endoscope or a microfiber catheter, fluorescence imaging provides the ability to diagnose the cancer organism with high sensitivity. For the practical application of fluorescence nanotechnology (FNP) in the practice of in vivo surgery, the following requirements must be followed: (i) FNP should be demonstrated with high purity and non-toxicity to ensure safe management, (ii) the biological system should have excellent colloidal stability to avoid degradation or aggregation and to increase blood circulation time, (iii) complete removal from the biological system should be guaranteed after the imaging process is completed, and (iv) dyes containing NPs should have high stable fluorescence to ensure long-term imaging and a good signal-to-noise ratio [233]. Previously, we emphasized that polymer NPs have excellent biocompatibility, low toxicity or non-toxicity, and can form long-term stable particles in the biological environment. Meanwhile, polymer NPs can be loaded with fluorescein multiple times to cause fluorescence enhancement, protect the dye in the nanoparticle core from the biological environment, and avoid unnecessary side effects, such as decreased fluorescence caused by protein interactions [234,235].
