["", "The bleomycin (BLM) family of glycopeptide-derived\nantitumor antibiotics\nconsists of BLMs, tallysomycins (TLMs), phleomycins (PLMs), and zorbamycin\n(ZBM). The self-resistant elements BlmB and TlmB, discovered from\nthe BLM- and TLM-producing organisms Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 and Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94\nATCC31158, respectively, are N-acetyltransferases\nthat provide resistance to the producers by disrupting the metal-binding\ndomain of the antibiotics required for activity. Although each member\nof the BLM family of antibiotics possesses a conserved metal-binding\ndomain, the structural differences between each member, namely, the\nbithiazole moiety and C-terminal amine of BLMs, have been suggested\nto instill substrate specificity within BlmB. Here we report that\nBlmB and TlmB readily accept and acetylate BLMs, TLMs, PLMs, and ZBM in vitro but only in the metal-free forms. Kinetic analysis\nof BlmB and TlmB reveals there is no strong preference or rate enhancement\nfor specific substrates, indicating that the structural differences\nbetween each member of the BLM family play a negligible role in substrate\nrecognition, binding, or catalysis. Intriguingly, the zbm gene cluster from Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC21892\ndoes not contain an N-acetyltransferase, yet ZBM\nis readily acetylated by BlmB and TlmB. We subsequently established\nthat S. flavoviridis lacks the homologue of BlmB\nand TlmB, and ZbmA, the ZBM-binding protein, alone is sufficient to\nprovide ZBM resistance. We further confirmed that BlmB can indeed\nconfer resistance to ZBM in vivo in S. flavoviridis, introduction of which into wild-type S. flavoviridis further increases the level of resistance.", "Bleomycins\n(BLMs), glycopeptide-derived\nantibiotics produced by Streptomyces verticillus,\nare clinically relevant natural products used in chemotherapy treatments\nagainst lymphomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and testicular cancer.1\u22124 BLMs cause sequence-specific oxidative cleavage of double-stranded\nDNA through a metal-dependent mechanism.5,6 BLMs contain\nfour functional domains (Figure 1): (i) the\nmetal-binding domain comprised of pyrimidoblamic acid and the \u03b2-hydroxyl\nhistidine, (ii) the DNA-binding domain consisting of the bithiazole\nmoiety and C-terminal amine tail in cooperation with the aminopyrimidine\nring, (iii) a linker region connecting the metal-binding and DNA-binding\ndomains, and (iv) the disaccharide moiety responsible for cell selectivity3,7\u221210 and DNA cleavage activity.11 Five nitrogen\natoms within the metal-binding domain (Figure 1) coordinate iron and oxygen in the active form of the antibiotic.\nA crystal structure of BLM bound to BlmA, the BLM-binding protein\nfound in the native producer, revealed that the primary amine of the\n\u03b2-aminoalanine moiety of BLM is the axial ligand to the metal\nion in the active BLM\u2013metal complex form.12", "Figure 1Structures of selected members of the bleomycin (BLM) family of\nantitumor antibiotics.

(ii) ZBM contains\na unique terminal amine compared with the BLMs, TLMs, and PLMs, which\nshare many of the same C-terminal amines. (iii) The BLMs, TLMs, and\nPLMs share the same disaccharide moiety; ZBM features a unique disaccharide,\nand TLM possesses an additional sugar in the linker region. The metal-binding\ndomain, however, is strictly conserved among all members of the family.", "Antibiotic producers must contain elements within their genomes\ncapable of providing self-resistance to the compounds they produce.\nGenerally, there are four major mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics:\nantibiotic modification or destruction, target modification, antibiotic\nefflux, or metabolic pathway circumvention.17 Antibiotic sequestration, usually stoichiometric, is a fifth possible\nmechanism.18\u221220Streptomyces verticillus contains\nat least two of these mechanisms. BlmA, the BLM-binding protein, noncovalently\nbinds metal-free and metal-bound BLMs, sequestering them and thereby\npreventing them from becoming active and cleaving DNA.6,12,20 BlmB, an N-acetyltransferase\nthat has been previously termed BAT,21,22 transfers\nan acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the primary amine of the \u03b2-aminoalanine\nmoiety, the axial ligand of BLMs\u2019 metal-binding domain.21,23 Although acetylation does not preclude metal from binding to BLMs,\nacetylation inhibits the metal-chelated complex from coordinating\nto and/or reducing molecular oxygen, thereby preventing the formation\nof activated BLMs.23,24 The resistance provided by BlmB\nhas been used as a selectable marker in bacteria, fungi, and mammalian\ncells.25\u221228", "Comparison of the biosynthetic gene clusters of BLM from S. verticillus ATCC15003,29 TLM\nfrom Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC31158,30 and ZBM from Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC2189231 reveals all three clusters\npossess homologues of the BLM-binding protein (blmA, tlmA, and zbmA, respectively)\n(Figure S1 of the Supporting Information).13 However, only the blm and tlm gene clusters contain genes encoding an N-acetyltransferase (blmB and tlmB, respectively), with S. flavoviridis lacking a blmB or tlmB homologue within the cloned zbm cluster. A protein sequence alignment showed BlmB is\n57% identical (64% similar) to TlmB. As described above, ZBM is structurally\ndistinct from BLMs and TLMs by the presence of a thiazolinyl-thiazole\nmoiety and a unique disaccharide moiety (Figure 1). The lack of a blmB/tlmB homologue\nwithin the zbm gene cluster led to the speculation\nthat (i) ZBM might be sufficiently different and is not accepted by\nan N-acetyltransferase as a substrate, (ii) a blmB/tlmB homologue may reside outside\nthe cloned zbm gene cluster, or (iii) ZbmA alone\nis sufficient to confer resistance to ZBM in S. flavoviridis.", "Given the structural similarity among the BLMs, TLMs, PLMs,\nand\nZBM, specifically the conserved metal-binding domain, it is easy to\nimagine BlmB or TlmB would accept any member of the BLM family of\nantibiotics and catalyze acetylation. Surprisingly, BlmB was reported\nto be incapable of acetylating PLM or bleomycinic acid, BLM lacking\nthe C-terminal amine.21,32 Recently, the crystal structure\nof BlmB was determined, suggesting that a three-aromatic amino acid\ncanyonlike groove is responsible for bithiazole specificity, while\nan electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged Glu188\nand the positively charged terminal amine is responsible for the lack\nof activity with bleomycinic acid.22", "Here, we report the in vitro characterization\nof the two known members of the BLM family of N-acetyltransferases,\nBlmB and TlmB, and an in vivo investigation of the\nresistance mechanisms of ZBM in S. flavoviridis SB9001,\na ZBM overproducer derived from wild-type S. flavoviridis ATCC21892.16 Our findings unveiled that\n(i) BlmB and TlmB acetylate all four members of the BLM family of\nantitumor antibiotics at the same primary amine of the \u03b2-aminoalanine\nmoiety, (ii) BlmB and TlmB react only on the metal-free forms of the\nantibiotics, consistent with the crystal structure of BlmB,22 (iii) there is no significant preference or\nrate enhancement by BlmB or TlmB for any of the four members of the\nBLM family, (iv) S. flavoviridis does not possess\na blmB/tlmB homologue outside the\ncloned zbm gene cluster, indicating ZbmA is sufficient\nto confer resistance to ZBM in S. flavoviridis, and\n(v) BlmB can confer resistance to ZBM in vivo in S. flavoviridis, introduction of which into wild-type S. flavoviridis further increases ZBM resistance.", "Materials\nand Methods", "Materials\nand Methods", "Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Biochemicals, and Chemicals", "Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Biochemicals, and Chemicals", "Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Biochemicals, and Chemicals", "Strains, plasmids, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers used\nin this study are summarized in Tables S1\u2013S3, respectively,\nof the Supporting Information.

The reacquisition of ZBM resistance\nin sensitive strain S. flavoviridis SB9031 by expression\nof blmB confirms that ZBM can be inactivated by a\nBlmB homologue in vivo and proves BlmB can confer\nresistance as the sole resistance element.", "This study highlights\nthe biochemical functionality and antibiotic\nresistance mechanism of the BLM family of antitumor antibiotics by\nthe BLM N-acetyltransferases.

On the basis of this study, we now propose a unified model\nfor self-resistance within the producers of BLM, TLM, and ZBM, with\nBlmA, TlmA, and ZbmA providing the primary mechanism of resistance\nand BlmB and TlmB as a secondary additional mechanism of resistance.", "This study highlights\nthe biochemical functionality and antibiotic\nresistance mechanism of the BLM family of antitumor antibiotics by\nthe BLM N-acetyltransferases.
