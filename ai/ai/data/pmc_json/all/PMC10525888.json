["Anti-microbial peptides provide a powerful toolkit for combating multidrug resistance. Combating eukaryotic pathogens is complicated because the intracellular drug targets in the eukaryotic pathogen are frequently homologs of cellular structures of vital importance in the host organism. The entomopathogenic bacteria (EPB), symbionts of entomopathogenic\u2013nematode species, release a series of non-ribosomal templated anti-microbial peptides. Some may be potential drug candidates. The ability of an entomopathogenic\u2013nematode/entomopathogenic bacterium symbiotic complex to survive in a given polyxenic milieu is a coevolutionary product. This explains that those gene complexes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of different non-ribosomal templated anti-microbial protective peptides (including those that are potently capable of inactivating the protist mammalian pathogen Leishmania donovanii and the gallinaceous bird pathogen Histomonas meleagridis) are co-regulated. Our approach is based on comparative anti-microbial bioassays of the culture media of the wild-type and regulatory mutant strains. We concluded that Xenorhabdus budapestensis and X. szentirmaii are excellent sources of non-ribosomal templated anti-microbial peptides that are efficient antagonists of the mentioned pathogens. Data on selective cytotoxicity of different cell-free culture media encourage us to forecast that the recently discovered \u201ceasy-PACId\u201d research strategy is suitable for constructing entomopathogenic-bacterium (EPB) strains producing and releasing single, harmless, non-ribosomal templated anti-microbial peptides with considerable drug, (probiotic)-candidate potential.", "1.

Considering the roles of the bacterial symbiont in the EPN/EPB symbiosis, we suppose that ani-protozoal compounds must coexist with other anti-microbial compounds in the CFCM of EPBs.

(B) To be able to identify the special antiprotist compounds. In this paper, we describe the very first steps toward these goals. For (A), one has to consider that the lack of uniformity regarding the choice of cell types for cytotoxicity assays may lead to incomparable and inconclusive data.

Electroporation was carried out using 2 mm gap electroporation cuvettes and a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator 600 with the setting 129 Ohm, 24 kV/cm. Transformants were selected on LB plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin (Km)\u2014120 \u03bcg/mL, streptomycin (Sm)\u2014100 \u03bcg/mL, gentamicin (Gm)\u201450 \u03bcg/mL, and Ap\u2014150 \u03bcg/mL). For the hfq KO recombination, EMC cells containing plasmid pBZs7 were grown in a LB broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics to a late logarithmic (OD600~1.1\u20131.2) phase; then, the culture was 2\u00d7 diluted with a fresh LB broth. L-arabinose was added in a final concentration of 1% and grown further in a shaker for 1.5 h at 30 \u00b0C. The electro-competent cells were prepared as described above. The KO PCR fragment was amplified using a pKD4 template plasmid and the primers hfq EMCdelfor and hfq EMCdelrev. The amplicon was precipitated in 96% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0. For electroporation, approximately 1 \u03bcg of a purified DNA fragment was used as described. After electroporation, cells were grown for 5 h at 30 \u00b0C, then spread on LB agar plates supplemented with 120 \u03bcg/mL Km and incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 2 days. The \u0394hfq::KmR recombinant was tested by colony PCRs. For deletion of the KmR cassette from the \u0394hfq::KmR mutant, pBZs1 was electroporated. A SmRApRKmR transformant colony was grown overnight at 30 \u00b0C in a LB broth supplemented with Ap, spread on LB + Ap agar plates, and incubated for 24 h at 30 \u00b0C. Then, the colonies were individually tested for the loss of the KmR gene and the pBZs1 plasmid on LB + Ap, LB + Km, and LB + Sm plates. The KmS \u0394hfq strains were tested by colony PCR using the primer pair hfqseqfor\u2013hfqseqrev. The \u0394hfq mutant EMA strain was generated according to [77]. The 769-bp upstream and the 617 bp downstream region of the hfq gene of EMA were amplified with primer pairs hfq_up-for-Bam-hfq_up-rev and hfq-EMA_down-for-hfq_down-rev-Sac, respectively. The two amplicons were assembled in the following PCR: The assembled amplicon was purified using the Illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare), digested with BamHI and SacI, and ligated into the BamHI-SacI site of pBluescript II SK(+) (pBZS13). After sequencing, the BamHI-SacI fragment from pBZS13 was transferred into the BamHI-SacI site of the R6K\u03b3-based plasmid pBZs12, leading to the SacB-bearing mobilizable recombination vector pBZs17. The recombination vector pBZs17 was then mobilized into EMA from E. coli S17-1 \u03bb pir. The ON culture of S17-1 \u03bb pir/pBZs17 was 50\u00d7 diluted with a fresh LB broth supplemented with Km and Sm and grown 3 h to OD600~0.5, while the EMA recipient was grown in LB + Ap ON to OD600~1.0. where 0.1 mL of donor and 1 mL of recipient cultures were mixed, centrifuged, and washed twice with 0.9% NaCl solution, then spread onto LB agar plates. After 4 h of incubation at 30 \u00b0C, the bacterial lawn was resuspended in a 3 mL 0.9% NaCl solution, and the cells were centrifuged and spread onto LB + KmAp agar plates. After four days of incubation at 30 \u00b0C, the Km-Gm-Ap-resistant recombinant colonies were tested by colony PCRs using primer pairs EMAhfqseqfor-trn5neo3 and pUCfor24-hfqseqrev. To gain \u0394hfq recombinants, the EMA::pBZs17 strain was grown for 18 h at 30 \u00b0C in LB + Ap broth, and 50, 100, and 200 \u03bcL of the culture was spread onto LB + Ap + 5% sucrose agar plates. After 48 h incubation at 30 \u00b0C, the individual SacR colonies were tested for KmS and GmS phenotypes; then, the appropriate colonies were tested by colony PCR using primers EMAhfqseqfor and hfqseqrev.

In laboratory in vitro conditions they release their products into their conditioned culture media (CFCM) in vitro. The chemical nature of these antimicrobials is oligo-peptide. However they are non-ribosomal anti-microbial peptides (NR-AMPs), which means that they are enzymatically synthesized through more than one step in their respective biosynthetic pathways.

The biosynthesis of the given sets of these effective antimicrobials is synchronized by a unique, genuine hierarchical genetic regulation mechanism called primary-secondary phase shift [71] with the hfq gene on the top [74,75,76,77,78].

Leishmania spp. is particularly problematic in light of its sophisticated resistance mechanisms, but it is also an excellent model for analyzing the mechanisms of drug resistance in eukaryotes [98,99]. Our research conception is that we think that some Xenorhabdus CFCM molecules (i.e., phenazine, fabclavine, or other molecules) may be selectively capable of dysregulating eukaryotic cell functions and stimulating apoptosis in protozoa without affecting the host [100]. From an application point of view, the development of natural compounds as anti-protozoal requires several aspects to be taken into consideration: (A) the anti-protozoal potential; (B) the durability, thermotolerance, and bioavailability; and (C) cytotoxicity, and unwanted side effects, especially if target organisms are eukaryotic pathogens. We have demonstrated that Xenorhabdus CFCM has broad-spectrum anti-protozoal activity against several human microbial pathogens. The key issue is identifying the specific active molecules in a complex mixture of potential anti-microbial molecules. The CFCMs of all three Xenorhabdus species were all active against Leishmania promastigotes in our experiments, but interestingly, none were active against Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes. Other researchers [83] found that EMA and EMK CFCMs were equally efficient against both Leishmania and Trypanosoma. In that study, they found that X. budapestensis, X. cabanillasii, X. hominickii, X. indica, X. innexii, and X. stockiae supernatants caused 100% mortality at the highest tested concentration (10%) against the promastigote form of L. tropica. No differences occurred between this treatment group and the positive control (p > 0.05) using N-methyl meglumine. There are several possible explanations for the differences between our findings and those of the Turkish team. For instance, the two studies used different strains of T. cruzi. In addition, there are differences in the experimental methods used between the two studies. In the case of the differential susceptibility of L. amazoennsis and T. cruzi (Brazil strain), it is likely due to differences in the surface compositions between the two parasites that lead to differential disruption of the cell membrane and/or intracellular penetration to act on specific subcellular targets. We focus on EMA and EMC species. We compared the anti-microbial potential of each of the used hfq-del mutants before using them as the source of double mutants producing single NR-AMPs. Our data in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 show that the anti-microbial activities of the hfq-del mutants can have enhanced anti-microbial activity not present in the wild-type stains. This may not be quite surprising considering that approximately 7.5% of the total genes in Xenorhabdus bacteria are dedicated to secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and probably most of these products are NR-AMPs. With an average 2.4 Mb-genome size of Xenorhabdus and a 1 kb locus size with about 10 ORFs per operon, there are 2400 genes and 240 respective operons (BGS) per genome. It is comparable with that of Staphylococcus, which has about 225 operons. According to the data accumulated, only about a dozen of biosynthetic anti-microbials have been discovered.

As for the results in the control (bacterium, fungi, and other strains), previous studies have identified several anti-microbial molecules in the CFCM of Xenorhabdus, including fabclavine [25,26].

We are convinced that this discovery may revolutionize the Xenorhabdus/Photorhabdus research, which in the age of multidrug resistance seems important. The point is that the operation of the different biosynthetic gene clusters BGCs (that is, operons) is synchronous, and their regulation is coordinated [76,77] by the gene encoding the RNA chaperone, Hfq [79]. The experimental system is based on the option of manipulation of the regulatory gene hfq [100,101,102,103,104] of the respective species. The regulatory mutant strain does not produce any biosynthetic AMP, but the respective individual promoters upstream of the respective biosynthetic gene cluster can be changed to inducible promotors, and this recombination will produce only a single respective AMP molecule. This provides an option of obtaining bacteria that produce only one single AMP molecule. The NR-AMP molecules have similar advantages to traditional antibiotics as the ribosomal templated AMPs, that is, the different pools of resistance genes with different motility patterns and collateral sensitivity, as well as molecular versatility. The advantage of the natural abundance in AMPs provided by the coevolutionary pattern of EPN/EPB symbiotic association may provide ammunition usable against MDR pathogens for a long time. This research line is further facilitated by the completed genome sequencing of several Xenorhabdus species, including X. szentirmaii [121] and X. budapestensis [122], making possible the identification of the promoter regions of each biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC, operon). Despite demonstrating the efficacy of vaccination in an experimental setting [55,58,123,124,125] no vaccine is yet commercially available.

Each of the tested geographical isolates of the Gram-positive (deadly pathogen for honeybee larvae) Paeibacillus larvae [96] bacterium species seems to be completely sensitive to (one or more) anti-microbial compounds present in the CFCM of wild-type Xenorhabdus budapestensis DSM16342\u2014mans (EMA). Six of the nine isolates, however, also seem to be sensitive to the anti-microbial active compound(s) present in the CFCM of the hfq (del) regulatory mutant of the same species (EMA). About half of them (mainly those which are resistant to the antimicrobials of the hfq (del) regulatory EMA mutant) were also resistant to the wild-type EMC CFCM, but each of them is resistant to the antimicrobials present in the CFCM of the hfq/del, a regulatory mutant of EMC."]
