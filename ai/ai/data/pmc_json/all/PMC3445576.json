We observed that the enteric insect pathogen, Serratia marcescens Db10, produced a diffusible compound that inhibited the growth of Bacillis subtilis and Staphyloccocus aureus. Mapping the genetic locus required for this activity revealed a putative natural product biosynthetic gene cluster, further defined to a six-gene operon named alb1\u2013alb6. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins encoded by alb1\u20136 predicted a hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) assembly line (Alb4/5/6), tailoring enzymes (Alb2/3) and an export/resistance protein (Alb1), and suggested that the machinery assembled althiomycin or a related molecule. Althiomycin is a ribosome-inhibiting antibiotic whose biosynthetic machinery had been elusive for decades. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses confirmed that wild type S. marcescens produced althiomycin and that production was eliminated on disruption of the alb gene cluster. Construction of mutants with in-frame deletions of specific alb genes demonstrated that Alb2\u2013Alb5 were essential for althiomycin production, whereas Alb6 was required for maximal production of the antibiotic. A phosphopantetheinyl transferase enzyme required for althiomycin biosynthesis was also identified. Expression of Alb1, a predicted major facilitator superfamily efflux pump, conferred althiomycin resistance on another, sensitive, strain of S. marcescens. This is the first report of althiomycin production outside of the Myxobacteria or Streptomyces and paves the way for future exploitation of the biosynthetic machinery, since S. marcescens represents a convenient and tractable producing organism.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "As the reported number of antibiotic resistant organisms continues to increase, the number of new antibiotics coming into use has dramatically declined over the past 20 years [1]. The majority of antibiotics that are in use within the clinic and in agriculture are derivatives of natural products and micro-organisms remain an essential source of potential drugs [2]. This has led to a surge in the mining of genomes and analysis of unique environmental niches in the search for novel antimicrobial compounds [3], [4]. In bacteria and fungi, many clinically relevant secondary metabolites (including antibiotics) are biosynthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes, polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes, or hybrids thereof. Examples include the clinically-relevant anticancer agents bleomycin A2 and ixempra (epothilone derivative), the anti-MRSA antibiotic dalfopristin (pristinamycin IIA/virginiamycin M1 derivative), and the pathogenicity-conferring siderophore yersiniabactin.

Secondly, PCR using primers specific to the S. marcescens Db10 alb gene cluster indicated the alb operon was most likely absent from S. marcescens ATCC274 (not shown). Consistent with S. marcescens ATCC274 not producing althiomycin, we also showed that it was sensitive to althiomycin produced by S. marcescens Db10 (Figure 7D), providing an ideal heterologous background to test the role of Alb1. The coding region for Alb1 was expressed in S. marcescens ATCC274 and resistance of the transformed strain to althiomycin was observed. Introduction of Alb1 into S. marcescens ATCC274 was indeed able to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of althiomycin, demonstrating that alb1 does confer resistance to althiomycin (Figure 7D). Since the zone of growth inhibition surrounding the S. marcescens Db10 spot on the S. marcescens ATCC274 lawn was relatively small, we generated a strain of Db10 producing higher levels of althiomycin to further confirm this result. The native althiomycin promoter was replaced with the constitutive T5 promoter on the chromosome of S. marcescens Db10. This strain was found to produce increased levels of althiomycin (not shown). Using this strain as the althiomycin producer, we were able to clearly demonstrate that resistance to althiomycin was observed in the S. marcescens ATCC274 strain expressing Alb1 (Figure 7D).", "Comparison with althiomycin biosynthesis in Myxococcus", "Comparison with althiomycin biosynthesis in Myxococcus", "Comparison with althiomycin biosynthesis in Myxococcus", "Concurrent with our independent, de novo identification, analysis and characterisation of the althiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of S. marcescens Db10, a similar cluster directing althiomycin production was identified in the Gram-negative, soil dwelling bacterium, Myxococcus xanthus strain DK897 [21], following earlier reports of althiomycin production by this organism [20]. S. marcescens Db10 and M. xanthus are only distantly related, being members of the Gamma and Delta Proteobacteria, respectively. Therefore to determine the level of similarity between the two althiomycin biosynthetic gene clusters, a comparative bioinformatic analysis was performed (Table 1). The althiomycin biosynthetic gene clusters of M. xanthus and S. marcescens Db10 both contain six genes: almA-F and alb1\u20136, respectively. Five of the six gene products are clearly equivalent and the gene order is conserved, suggesting that the clusters are related. The Alb1\u20135 proteins share reasonable identity with the corresponding proteins in M. xanthus at the primary amino acid sequence level (Table 1). Our predictions for the role played by each of these proteins in althiomycin biosynthesis by S. marcescens Db10 are similar to those made for the corresponding proteins in M. xanthus\n[21]. Surprisingly however, Alb6 and AlmF show no detectable identity with each other at the primary amino acid sequence level. Alb6 is predicted to be a type II thioesterase, with an \u2018editing\u2019 or \u2018proofreading\u2019 function, required for the removal of misloaded building blocks or incorrect intermediates from the NRPS/PKS machinery [13]. This finding is corroborated by the finding that althiomycin production is reduced to \u223c10% of wild type levels in the alb6 mutant. By contrast, AlmF of M. xanthus is predicted to be a proline iminopeptidase (TIGR01250) and Cortina et al. (2011) prefer a model where AlmF catalyses the formation of the methyoxypyrrolinone ring of althiomycin following release from the NRPS-PKS enzyme. These authors do note, however, that this step could also be performed by the integrated (Type I) thioesterase domain at the end of AlmB (equivalent to that of Alb5). Alb6 and AlmF are both members of the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase superfamily of proteins (Pfam 12697) and consistent with this, similarities in the predicted protein secondary structures of these proteins can be seen (not shown). Additionally, minor differences exist in the organisation of the biosynthetic operons between the two organisms. In M. xanthus, almB and almF (equivalent to alb5 and alb6) are predicted to be translationally coupled.

A Sigma Ascentis Express column (C18, 150\u00d72.1 mm, 2.7 \u00b5m) was used. Mobile phases consisted of A (water containing 0.1% formic acid) and B (methanol containing 0.1% formic acid). A gradient of 20% B to 100% B in 15 minutes was employed with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Absorbance at 270 nm was monitored. The mass spectrometer was operated in electrospray positive ion mode with a scan range of 50\u20132,000 m/z. Source conditions were: end plate offset at \u2212500 V; capillary at \u22124500 V; nebulizer gas (N2) at 1.6 bar; dry gas (N2) at 8 L/min; dry Temperature at 180\u00b0C. Ion tranfer conditions: ion funnel RF at 200 Vpp; multiple RF at 200 Vpp; quadruple low mass at 55 m/z; collision energy at 5.0 ev; collision RF at 600 Vpp; ion cooler RF at 50\u2013350 Vpp; transfer time at 121 \u00b5s; pre-Pulse storage time at 1 \u00b5s. Calibration was done with sodium formate (10 mM) through a loop injection of 20 \u00b5L of standard solution at the beginning of each run.", "Purification of althiomycin", "Purification of althiomycin", "Purification of althiomycin", "Althiomycin was purified from the supernatant of a spent LB culture by semi-preparative HPLC (Agilent Zorbax, RP-C18, 100\u00d721 mm, 5 \u00b5m) on an Agilent 1100 instrument. Mobile phases consisted of A: water containing 0.1% formic acid and B: methanol containing 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was 5 ml/min and absorbance at 270 nm was monitored. A gradient of 20% B (see above) to 100% B in 25 minutes was employed for the first purification. Fractions containing althiomycin were identified by MS and pooled. The pooled fractions were freeze-dried after solvent removal at reduced pressure; the dried material was then dissolved in a small volume of methanol and re-purified on the same column with a gradient of 60% B to 100% B over 25 minutes. Fractions containing althiomycin were freeze-dried and dissolved in 200 \u00b5l of d6-DMSO for NMR analysis.", "Althiomycin was purified from the supernatant of a spent LB culture by semi-preparative HPLC (Agilent Zorbax, RP-C18, 100\u00d721 mm, 5 \u00b5m) on an Agilent 1100 instrument.
