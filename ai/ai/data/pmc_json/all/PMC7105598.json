Usually they are biosynthesized through secondary metabolic pathways encoded by cluster situated genes. And these gene clusters are stringently regulated by interweaved transcriptional regulatory cascades. In the past decades, great advances have been made to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved in antibiotic production in Streptomyces. In this review, we summarized the recent advances on the regulatory cascades of antibiotic production in Streptomyces from the following four levels: the signals triggering the biosynthesis, the global regulators, the pathway-specific regulators and the feedback regulation. The production of antibiotic can be largely enhanced by rewiring the regulatory networks, such as overexpression of positive regulators, inactivation of repressors, fine-tuning of the feedback and ribosomal engineering in Streptomyces. The enormous amount of genomic sequencing data implies that the Streptomyces has potential to produce much more antibiotics for the great diversities and wide distributions of biosynthetic gene clusters in Streptomyces genomes. Most of these gene clusters are defined cryptic for unknown or undetectable natural products. In the synthetic biology era, activation of the cryptic gene clusters has been successfully achieved by manipulation of the regulatory genes. Chemical elicitors, rewiring regulatory gene and ribosomal engineering have been employed to crack the potential of cryptic gene clusters. These have been proposed as the most promising strategy to discover new antibiotics. For the complex of regulatory network in Streptomyces, we proposed that the discovery of new antibiotics and the optimization of industrial strains would be greatly promoted by further understanding the regulatory mechanism of antibiotic production.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Streptomyces, Gram-positive mycelial bacteria with high GC content, shows a complex morphological differentiation and belongs to actinobacteria (Hopwood, 2019). It is reported that 61% of so far discovered microorganism-derived bioactive substances are produced by actinobacteria (mainly Streptomyce). Most of the clinically essential drugs containing antibiotic and other bio-active agents are derived from Streptomyces (Waksman et al., 2010). In the past decades, scientists have made great advances to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms related to antibiotic production in Streptomyces. Generally, the antibiotic production is stringently and elaborately regulated by pyramidal transcriptional regulatory cascades, including signaling pathways, global regulators, pathway-specific regulator (PSR), and feedback regulation. This interweaved networks can determine the production levels of antibiotic under specific culture condition (Chater, 2016).", "Streptomyces, Gram-positive mycelial bacteria with high GC content, shows a complex morphological differentiation and belongs to actinobacteria (Hopwood, 2019).

Among them, A-factor, the chemical structural characteristic \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL), is the first Streptomyces hormone reported as a signal triggering streptomycin production in Streptomyces griseus in 1967. Avenolide was identified as a new type of butenolide hormone regulating avermectin production in Streptomyces avermitilis (Kitani et al., 2011). The production of the methylenomycin is induced by methylenomycin furan (MMF), a furan-type autoregulator in Streptomyces coelicolor (Xu G. et al., 2010). It was reported that 84.1% actinomycetes probably use either GBL (64.1%) or butenolide (24%) to control the antibiotic production (Thao et al., 2017). A-factor, coupled with its receptor ArpA, controls transcription of the master positive regulator AdpA for morphological differentiation and streptomycin production in S. griseus (Higo et al., 2012).", "The first one is the onset of antibiotic production, which is triggered by the coupled receptors of Streptomyces \u201chormones\u201d or other signals.

The global regulators affect more than one metabolic pathways and may not directly affect any specific biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). They also respond to a variety of chemical or physiological signals, e.g., nutrient limitation, the concentration of chitin or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the medium, cell wall damage, heat shock or pH shift. Two-component systems (TCSs, consisted with a membrane-bound histidine kinase, which senses specific environmental stimuli, and a cognate regulator) play crucial roles in sensing extracellular signals. Typical TCSs mediate responses to the cellular signal, mainly through regulating the transcription of downstream genes. Moreover, TCSs, as the most abundant pleiotropic regulators, are involved in the dynamic control of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in Streptomyces. E.g., PhoP/PhoR can regulate antibiotic production and morphological differentiation (Yepes et al., 2011; Rodriguez et al., 2013). Both antibiotic production and GlcNAc uptake via the phosphotransferase system are directly regulated by DasR, a GntR-family allosteric regulator, with the GlcNAc as a ligand (Fillenberg et al., 2016). The major checkpoint for the onset of secondary metabolism is the accumulation of GlcNAc through the autolytic degradation of the vegetative mycelium. The antibiotic production is triggered by DasR regulon (Rigali et al., 2008). AdpA, which is ubiquitously distributed in streptomycetes as a member of the AraC/XylS family regulators, affects transcription of hundreds of genes involved in morphological differentiation and antibiotic biosynthesis (Higo et al., 2012; Guyet et al., 2014). ArpA, the receptor of A-factor, regulated the transcription of adpA in S. griseus. The transcription level of adpA is dynamic controlled by the interaction between ArpA and A-factor. As A-factor reached a threshold concentration, it binds to ArpA and releases the repression of adpA transcription (Wei J. et al., 2018). WblA and AtrA also have been extensively investigated as the global regulators involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotic. As a global repressor, WblA affects doxorubicin (DXR), tautomycetin, and daptomycin biosynthesis in their natural host strains (Noh et al., 2010; Nah et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2014). However, WblA activates natamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces chattanoogensis (Yu et al., 2014).", "The second level is the global regulators which bring pleiotropic effects on the lower level of regulators.

PSRs are situated in the BGCs of secondary metabolites and directly regulate the transcription of the biosynthetic genes. So they have been called the \u201ccluster-situated regulators (CSRs).\u201d SARP (Streptomyces\nantibiotic regulatory proteins), LAL (large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family) and PAS-LuxR family regulators usually belong to PSRs (Martin and Liras, 2012). The ActII-ORF4 and RedD of S. coelicolor and DnrI of S. peucetius are typical SARPs family activators (Song et al., 2011). The LAL family regulators, which comprise an N-terminal ATP/GTP-binding domain and a C-terminal LuxR family DNA-binding domain, usually activate the biosynthesis of antibiotic in Streptomyces. PimR, RapH, NysRI, AveR, and SlnR, which are typical LAL regulators, are located in type I polyketide BGCs in Streptomyces (Anton et al., 2004; Sekurova et al., 2004; Kuscer et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2017). The whole process of avermectin biosynthesis is controlled by direct interaction between AveR and all promoters of ave cluster (Guo et al., 2010). The PAS-LuxR family regulator is characterized with an N-terminal PAS sensory domain and a C-terminal LuxR type DNA binding domain. PAS domain probably function as responsor to light, redox potential, oxygen, overall energy level of a cell, and small ligands (Taylor and Zhulin, 1999). For the cytosol localization, proteins containing PAS domains can sense internal signals and other environmental factors which cross the cell membrane. PimM, a PAS-LuxR family regulator, positively regulates pimaricin production in Streptomyces natalensis (Anton et al., 2007). The orthologs of PimM have been represented in most of the reported BGCs of antifungal polyketides like amphotericin (AmphRIV), candicidin (FscRI), nystatin (NysRIV), and filipin (PteF) gene clusters (Santos-Aberturas et al., 2011). PSRs also contain other family repressor or activator. The production of antibiotic can be positively or negatively regulated by TetR, MarR, LysR, and IclR family regulators (Molina-Henares et al., 2006; Martin and Liras, 2012; Cuthbertson and Nodwell, 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2018).", "The third level is pathway-specific regulators (PSRs), which are taken as the master switches of antibiotic production.

Evidences has shown that antibiotic functions as signals to regulate the production of antibiotic besides as feedback substances for the enzymatic reactions. Antibiotic, as ligand for proper regulator, affects the final production in Streptomyces. The expression of antibiotic biosynthetic genes was modulated by the RedZ and undecylprodigiosin complex (Wang L. et al., 2009). The activity of AtrA, which regulates primary and secondary metabolism, is reduced by lidamycin of Streptomyces globisporus and actinorhodin (ACT) of S. coelicolor (Li et al., 2015). The biosynthesis of jadomycin is dynamically modulated by the interaction among jadomycin B, chloramphenicol, JadR1 and JadR2 in Streptomyces venezuelae (Wang L. et al., 2009; Xu D. et al., 2010). Daunorubicin (DNR) biosynthesis is regulated by three DNA binding regulatory proteins (DnrI, DnrN, and DnrO). The DNA binding activity of DnrO can be modulated by Rhodomycin D, a glycosylated precursor of DXR (Jiang and Hutchinson, 2006). Simocyclinone and its precursors inhibit the binding activity of SimReg1 to several promoter regions of simocyclinone biosynthesis genes and SimReg1 encoding gene (Horbal et al., 2012). As a GBL receptor-like protein, PapR5, which is the major regulator of pristinamycin biosynthesis, may sense pristinamycin or intermediate(s) of the pathway (Mast et al., 2015). SsaA can activate sansanmycin biosynthesis by binding to five different regions within the sansanmycin BGC. The sansanmycins A and H inhibit DNA-binding activity of SsaA in a concentration-dependent manner (Li et al., 2013). The rifamycin B, the end product of rifamycin biosynthesis, can relieve the repression of RifQ on the transcription of the rifamycin efflux pump (RifP) (Lei et al., 2018). Transporters may affect product maturation. Deletion of nysG and nysH, two ABC transporters encoding genes, resulted in ca. 35% reduction of nystatin production and accumulation of its deoxy precursor in Streptomyces noursei. NysGH complex is prone to export nystatin. Its activity would enhance the last biosynthetic step by relief of the feedback through final product removal (Sletta et al., 2005). \u2018LanT,\u2019 the dedicated ABC transporter for both class I and II lantibiotics, plays an important role in production of the final product (Gebhard, 2012).", "The fourth level is the feedback regulation which is brought by antibiotic and/or intermediates to coordinate antibiotic production and transport.

The titer improvement can efficiently and simply be achieved by over-expression of genes encoding activators with proper promoters. As listed in Table 1, overexpression of genes encoding LAL family regulators, such as MilR, NemR, and AveR, has been used to increase production of milbemycin in S. bingchenggensis BC04, nemadectin in S. cyaneogriseus subsp. non-cyanogenus NMWT1 and avermectin in S. avermitilis, respectively (Guo et al., 2010; Zhang Y. et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019). Overproduction of nikkomycin has been achieved by engineering of the CSR activator gene sanG with different constitutive promoters (Liu et al., 2005). Overproduction of oxytetracycline (OTC) has been achieved by overexpression of the CSR activator gene otcR as tandem copies under the control of a constitutive SF14 promoter (Yin et al., 2015). Similar strategy has also been used to overproduce tacrolimus (FK506) in Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL18488 by overexpression of bulZ (Ma et al., 2018). Other examples include LysR family regulator for ascomycin production in S. hygroscopicus var. ascomyceticus (Song et al., 2017), PAS-LuxR family regulator for wuyiencin production in Streptomyces wuyiensis CK-15 (Liu et al., 2014), and Crp/Fnr family regulator for leinamycin production in Streptomyces atroolivaceus (Huang et al., 2016).", "Examples of antibiotic production enhancement in Streptomyces by regulatory gene manipulation.", "Examples of antibiotic production enhancement in Streptomyces by regulatory gene manipulation.", "Examples of antibiotic production enhancement in Streptomyces by regulatory gene manipulation.", "Strategy Antibiotics Strains Regulators (family) Yield References.", "Strategy Antibiotics Strains Regulators (family) Yield References.", "Strategy Antibiotics Strains Regulators (family) Yield References.", "Overexpression of positive genes Milbemycin S. bingchenggensis MilR(LAL) 138% Zhang Y. et al., 2016.", "Overexpression of positive genes Milbemycin S. bingchenggensis MilR(LAL) 138% Zhang Y. et al., 2016.", "Overexpression of positive genes Milbemycin S. bingchenggensis MilR(LAL) 138% Zhang Y. et al., 2016.", "Nemadectin S. cyaneogriseus NemR(LAL) 179.9% Li et al., 2019.", "Nemadectin S. cyaneogriseus NemR(LAL) 179.9% Li et al., 2019.", "Nemadectin S. cyaneogriseus NemR(LAL) 179.9% Li et al., 2019.", "Avermectin S. avermitilis AveR(LAL) 164% Guo et al., 2010.", "Avermectin S. avermitilis AveR(LAL) 164% Guo et al., 2010.", "Avermectin S. avermitilis AveR(LAL) 164% Guo et al., 2010.", "Nikkomycin S. ansochromogenes SanG(SARP) 200% Liu et al., 2005.", "Nikkomycin S. ansochromogenes SanG(SARP) 200% Liu et al., 2005.", "Nikkomycin S. ansochromogenes SanG(SARP) 200% Liu et al., 2005.", "Oxytetracycline S. rimosus OtcR(SARP) 649% Yin et al., 2015.", "Oxytetracycline S. rimosus OtcR(SARP) 649% Yin et al., 2015.", "Oxytetracycline S. rimosus OtcR(SARP) 649% Yin et al., 2015.", "FK-506 S. tsukubaensis BulZ (SARP) \u223c330% Ma et al., 2018.", "FK-506 S. tsukubaensis BulZ (SARP) \u223c330% Ma et al., 2018.", "FK-506 S. tsukubaensis BulZ (SARP) \u223c330% Ma et al., 2018.", "Wuyiencin S. ahygroscopicus WysR(PAS-LuxR) 300% Liu et al., 2014.", "Wuyiencin S. ahygroscopicus WysR(PAS-LuxR) 300% Liu et al., 2014.", "Wuyiencin S. ahygroscopicus WysR(PAS-LuxR) 300% Liu et al., 2014.", "Leinamycin S. atroolivaceus LnmO(Crp/Fnr) 300% Huang et al., 2016.", "Leinamycin S. atroolivaceus LnmO(Crp/Fnr) 300% Huang et al., 2016.", "Leinamycin S. atroolivaceus LnmO(Crp/Fnr) 300% Huang et al., 2016.", "Pimaricin S. natalensis PimM(PAS-LuxR) 240% Anton et al., 2007.", "Pimaricin S. natalensis PimM(PAS-LuxR) 240% Anton et al., 2007.", "Pimaricin S. natalensis PimM(PAS-LuxR) 240% Anton et al., 2007.", "Pimaricin S. chattanoogensis ScnRII(PAS-LuxR) 400% Du et al., 2009.", "Pimaricin S. chattanoogensis ScnRII(PAS-LuxR) 400% Du et al., 2009.", "Pimaricin S. chattanoogensis ScnRII(PAS-LuxR) 400% Du et al., 2009.", "Milbemycin S. hygroscopicus MilR2 (TetR) 34.4% Wei K. et al., 2018.", "Milbemycin S. hygroscopicus MilR2 (TetR) 34.4% Wei K. et al., 2018.", "Milbemycin S. hygroscopicus MilR2 (TetR) 34.4% Wei K. et al., 2018.", "Avermectin S. avermitilis SAV4189 (MarR) 250% Guo et al., 2018.", "Avermectin S. avermitilis SAV4189 (MarR) 250% Guo et al., 2018.", "Avermectin S. avermitilis SAV4189 (MarR) 250% Guo et al., 2018.", "FK-506 S. tsukubaensis FkbN (LAL) 176% Zhang X.
