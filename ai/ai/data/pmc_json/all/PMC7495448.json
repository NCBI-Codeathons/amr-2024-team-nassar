According to Bader\u2019s topological\ntheory,18,34 if \u03c1BCP is lower than 0.10\na.u. and its \u22072\u03c1BCP is a low positive\nvalue, the closed-shell interactions will appear in the BCP between\ntwo atoms. For the appearance of the H-bonding interaction, Koch and\nPopelier proposed that electron density at the BCP between the hydrogen\natom and proton acceptor (H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B BCP) must be in the\nrange of 0.002\u20130.040 a.u. and its Laplacian at this point must\nlie within the 0.020\u20130.150 a.u. range.38 As can be seen from Table 1, the \u03c1 and \u22072\u03c1 values at the\nvarious hydrogen BCPs (HBCPs) exceed the proposed range by Koch and\nPopelier, indicating the presence of very strong H-bonds within this\nactive site.", "Structural and Topological Parameters\nof
