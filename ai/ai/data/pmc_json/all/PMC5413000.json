In the last years, a growing interest to study the relationship between MS and psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, has emerged obtaining conflicting results. Diet-induced MS rat models have only examined the effects of high-fat or mixed cafeteria diets to a limited extent. We explored whether an anxiety-like behavior was associated with MS in non-stressed rats chronically submitted to a high-sucrose diet (20% sucrose in drinking water) using three different anxiety paradigms: the shock-probe/burying test (SPBT), the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the open-field test (OFT). Behaviorally, the high-sucrose diet group showed an increase in burying behavior in the SPBT. Also, these animals displayed both avoidance to explore the central part of the arena and a significant increase in freezing behavior in the OFT and lack of effects in the EPM. Also, high-sucrose diet group showed signs of an MS-like condition: significant increases in body weight and body mass index, abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia. Plasma leptin and resistin levels were also increased. No changes in plasma corticosterone levels were found. These results indicate that rats under a 24-weeks high-sucrose diet develop an MS associated with an anxiety-like behavior. Although the mechanisms underlying this behavioral outcome remain to be investigated, the role of leptin is emphasized.", "Data Availability", "All relevant data are within the paper.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Metabolic syndrome (MS) may be defined as a cluster of signs that increases the risk to develop diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), cardiovascular disease and some types of cancer.

However, the results obtained so far have been rather contradictory. Carroll and colleagues [2] showed evidence for a positive association between general anxiety disorder and MS within a large population of male US veterans from the Vietnam War. Likewise, Weiss et al. (2011) [3] found that post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] is associated with increased rates of MS within an african-american urban population. More recently, Albert et al., [4] using a cross-sectional approximation, found that the prevalence of MS in a sample of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is higher than those reported in the Italian general population. Additionally, in the last year, Tang and collaborators reported that anxiety has a significant positive association with MS using a meta-analytic approach [5]. In contrast with these findings, Hildrum et al., [6] did not find an association between anxiety and MS in a Norwegian cohort. Furthermore, in 2011, Linnville and collaborators [7] stated that the overall prevalence of MS was the same in repatriated prisoners of the Vietnam War with and without PTSD in comparison with a control group. Thus, it is clear that the information generated from human studies is not enough to clarify whether or not exists a relationship between MS and anxiety disorders [5] and the nature of this association.", "In the last years there has been a growing interest to study the relationship between MS and psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety.

Since leptin deficient mice (ob/ob) exhibit an anxious phenotype [57], and acute leptin administration produces both anxiolytic effects in normal mice [58] and attenuates anxiety in ob/ob mice [59], it may be feasible that leptin resistance may have developed as a consequence of the high-sucrose diet and be involved in the anxiogenic effects reported in this paper. In support to this possibility, it has been reported that diet-induced obese rats show a self-resistance state to leptin within the hypothalamus [60, 61] and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) [62, 63]. This condition may have been evolved through a diminished leptin receptor gene expression accompanied by reduced signal transduction [61] and/or a putative reduction in leptin transport into the cerebral-spinal fluid [64]. On the other hand, it is generally admitted that amygdala plays a paramount role in the modulation of anxiety [65] and that considerable experimental evidence indicates that dopaminergic receptor mechanisms play an important role in this modulation [66, 67]. Since VTA neurons are the origin of the dopamine (DA) innervation of the amygdala [67] and it has been demonstrated that conditional knock-out mice lacking leptin receptor (Leprdat-Cre mice) in the VTA show an anxiogenic profile [58], it is conceivable that leptin resistance within VTA may underlie the anxiety behavior observed in our experiments. Moreover, it is tempting to speculate, that such anxiogenic effects may be mediated through activity of dopamine D1 receptors since the intra-amygdaloid administration of SCH-23390, a selective D1 receptor antagonist, attenuated anxiety in Leprdat-Cre mice [58] and induces anxiolytic responses in rats subjected both to the LDBT [67], the EPM [68] and the SPBT [69].", "On the other hand, plasma leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone encoded by the ob gene, was found elevated in this work.
