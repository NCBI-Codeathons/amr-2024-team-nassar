["", "Grassypeptolides A\u2212C (1\u22123), a group of closely related bis-thiazoline containing cyclic depsipeptides, have been isolated from extracts of the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya confervoides. Although structural differences between the analogues are minimal, comparison of the in vitro cytotoxicity of the series revealed a structure\u2212activity relationship. When the ethyl substituent of 1 is changed to a methyl substituent in 2, activity is only slightly reduced (3\u22124-fold), whereas inversion of the Phe unit flanking the bis-thiazoline moiety results in 16\u221223-fold greater potency. We show that both 1 and 3 cause G1 phase cell cycle arrest at lower concentrations, followed at higher concentrations by G2/M phase arrest, and that these compounds bind Cu2+ and Zn2+. The three-dimensional structure of 2 was determined by MS, NMR, and X-ray crystallography, and the structure of 3 was established by MS, NMR, and chemical degradation. The structure of 3 was explored by in silico molecular modeling, revealing subtle differences in overall conformation between 1 and 3. Attempts to interconvert 1 and 3 with base were unsuccessful, but enzymatic conversion may be possible and could be a novel form of activation for chemical defense.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Natural products have historically been a rich source of bioactive compounds and represent a significant portion of marketed drugs, either unchanged or as templates for synthetic modification.1,2 In recent years natural products from marine sources have received increased attention,(3) in part due to the vast biodiversity of the marine environment, a situation that plausibly increases the need for chemical defenses as a result of intense competition and predation.

This compound shares some structural features with the cyanobactins, including lissoclinamide 7 (see Figure 1b). Interestingly, although the cyanobactins are now known to be biosynthesized through a novel ribosomal pathway,13\u2212151 is most likely the result of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system, because of the incorporation of nonproteinogenic units and N-methylation.

The presence of a 2-aminobutyric acid derived thiazoline carboxylic acid unit was proposed by default, as there were no HMBC or ROESY correlations between the thiazoline ring and the aminobutyric acid portion. Importantly, although the proton and carbon chemical shifts were very similar to those of 1 and 2, those at position 28 were distinct (\u03b4H/\u03b4C was 3.83/69.0 and 5.48/59.2 for 1 and 3, respectively). Second, the methyl signal at position 36 also showed substantially different chemical shifts (\u03b4H/\u03b4C was 2.78/39.6 for 1 and 3.169/30.7 for 3).

Analysis of the fragmentation patterns of 1 and 2, as well as MS/MS/MS of the prominent ions 859.3 and 845.3 (see Figure 3) allowed the assignments shown.

Compound 3 was treated with ozone at \u221278 \u00b0C followed by oxidative workup and acid hydrolysis, and then the product was analyzed by chiral HPLC-MS to detect the presence of d-Aba. Under these conditions two peaks were observed corresponding to N-Me-l-Phe and N-Me-d-Phe in the ratio 1.28:1, respectively. More stringent ozonolysis conditions were then used to treat both 1 and 3 (30 min, rt) in order to convert N-Me-Phe to N-Me-Asp. Analysis of the reaction product of 3 by chiral HPLC-MS again showed the presence of both enantiomers of N-Me-Asp in the ratio of 1.22:1 l to d. Two peaks in the ratio of 1:1.85 corresponding to N-Me-l-Asp and N-Me-d-Asp, respectively, were also apparent in the ozonolysis product of 1 under the same conditions.

Analysis of the reaction product of 3 by chiral HPLC-MS again showed the presence of both enantiomers of N-Me-Asp in the ratio of 1.22:1 l to d. Two peaks in the ratio of 1:1.85 corresponding to N-Me-l-Asp and N-Me-d-Asp, respectively, were also apparent in the ozonolysis product of 1 under the same conditions. In an attempt to liberate N-Me-Phe under milder conditions, leading to less epimerization, we treated both 1 and 3 with RuCl3/NaIO4, which in the past has been used both to cleave double bonds and to oxidize thioethers.(20) After hydrolysis of the reaction product with 6 N HCl (110 \u00b0C, 16 h), chiral HPLC-MS analysis revealed the presence of N-Me-l-Phe and N-Me-d-Phe in the ratios 1:4.88 for 1 and 3.35:1 for 3, clearly indicating l-configuration in 3 and d-configuration in 1. The difference in configuration at that position is consistent with NMR chemical shift evidence, as pointed out above. Additionally, compounds 1 and 3 have very different specific rotations ([\u03b1]20D of +78 and +18\u00b0, respectively), supporting a difference in configuration. Consistent with previous experience with 1, both l-cysteic acid and d-cysteic acid (Cya) were detected in the ozonolysis product of 3. Since both enantiomers were observed in a similar ratio when derived from 1 and 3 (\u223c2:1), and also because the 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of the thiazoline moiety signals are both much the same as those of 1, the configuration of both are likely R in 3 as well as 1. Consequently, we conclude that 1 and 3 differ indeed only in the configuration at C-28.", "Considering that we isolated two epimers, 1 and 3, from cyanobacterial extracts, a relevant question is whether the intact molecules can interconvert. This has some precedence, for example, a synthetic analogue of trunkamide A containing l-Phe adjacent to the thiazoline in place of d-Phe showed spontaneous epimerization to the natural product.(21) Likewise, the synthetic 31S isomer of lissoclinamide 7 showed conversion to lissoclinamide 7 (see Figure 1b) in the presence of pyridine and CDCl3 at 60 \u00b0C, although the reverse conversion was not observed.(22) Using these same conditions we were not able to convert intact 3 to 1 or vice versa, perhaps suggesting that neither are isolation artifacts.

Both compounds exhibited [M \u2212 H + Cu]+ ions with the expected isotope distribution, as well as several Zn2+ adducts ([M + Zn]2+, [M \u2212 H + Zn]+, and [M + ZnCl]+).", "Figure 6Structures of patellamides A and C and the structure of the bis-Cu(II)-ascidiacyclamide complex, with TAO domains in red.", "Figure 6Structures of patellamides A and C and the structure of the bis-Cu(II)-ascidiacyclamide complex, with TAO domains in red.", "Figure 6Structures of patellamides A and C and the structure of the bis-Cu(II)-ascidiacyclamide complex, with TAO domains in red.", "Structures of patellamides A and C and the structure of the bis-Cu(II)-ascidiacyclamide complex, with TAO domains in red.", "Structures of patellamides A and C and the structure of the bis-Cu(II)-ascidiacyclamide complex, with TAO domains in red.", "Structures of patellamides A and C and the structure of the bis-Cu(II)-ascidiacyclamide complex, with TAO domains in red.", "Figure 7Circular dichroism spectra of grassypeptolide A (1) in the presence and absence of Cu2+ and Zn2+: (a) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 and 2 equiv of Cu2+ to 1; (b) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Cu2+; (c) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 or 2 equiv of Zn2+; (d) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Zn2+.", "Figure 7Circular dichroism spectra of grassypeptolide A (1) in the presence and absence of Cu2+ and Zn2+: (a) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 and 2 equiv of Cu2+ to 1; (b) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Cu2+; (c) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 or 2 equiv of Zn2+; (d) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Zn2+.", "Figure 7Circular dichroism spectra of grassypeptolide A (1) in the presence and absence of Cu2+ and Zn2+: (a) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 and 2 equiv of Cu2+ to 1; (b) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Cu2+; (c) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 or 2 equiv of Zn2+; (d) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Zn2+.", "Circular dichroism spectra of grassypeptolide A (1) in the presence and absence of Cu2+ and Zn2+: (a) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 and 2 equiv of Cu2+ to 1; (b) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Cu2+; (c) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 or 2 equiv of Zn2+; (d) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Zn2+.", "Circular dichroism spectra of grassypeptolide A (1) in the presence and absence of Cu2+ and Zn2+: (a) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 and 2 equiv of Cu2+ to 1; (b) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Cu2+; (c) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 or 2 equiv of Zn2+; (d) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Zn2+.", "Circular dichroism spectra of grassypeptolide A (1) in the presence and absence of Cu2+ and Zn2+: (a) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 and 2 equiv of Cu2+ to 1; (b) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Cu2+; (c) CD spectra of 1 alone and after addition of 1 or 2 equiv of Zn2+; (d) differences induced in the CD spectrum of 1 by addition of Zn2+.", "Figure 8(a) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 1; (b) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 3; (c) calculated isotope patterns for the observed metal adducts.", "Figure 8(a) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 1; (b) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 3; (c) calculated isotope patterns for the observed metal adducts.", "Figure 8(a) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 1; (b) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 3; (c) calculated isotope patterns for the observed metal adducts.", "(a) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 1; (b) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 3; (c) calculated isotope patterns for the observed metal adducts.", "(a) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 1; (b) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 3; (c) calculated isotope patterns for the observed metal adducts.", "(a) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 1; (b) Cu2+ and Zn2+ adducts observed for 3; (c) calculated isotope patterns for the observed metal adducts.", "Conclusions", "Conclusions", "We have described two new cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptides, grassypeptolides B (2) and C (3). Compounds 1\u22123 show a natural structure\u2212activity relationship. While the replacement of d-Aba (1) with d-Ala (2) only slightly reduced potency, inversion of N-Me-d-Phe (1) to N-Me-l-Phe (3) lowered the IC50 by 16\u221223-fold (see Table 3). Like the thiazole- and oxazoline-containing cyclic peptides patellamides A and C and ulithiacyclamide, compounds 1 and 3 can bind to metals. This activity may be a potential mechanism for cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, as many classes of enzymes are known to rely on metal cofactors. For example, ribonucleotide reductase (RR) requires iron for catalysis of the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, the precursors needed for the synthesis of DNA during S phase of the cell cycle. Iron depletion by exogenous chelators therefore causes cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase,(34) through inhibition of RR and other mechanisms.(35) However, metal chelators have been shown to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest under some conditions, such as desferrioxamine(36) and tachpyridine.(30) The latter was shown to mediate this effect through activation of CHK1 and CHK2, potentially through ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related kinase (ATR). Another potential target for metal chelators is Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1),37,38 which protects cells from superoxide radicals produced during normal metabolism and especially at times of oxidative stress. Inhibition of SOD1 can lead to buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can result in activation of both G1 and G2 checkpoint functions through the ataxia telangiectasia gene product (ATM).(39) Our cell cycle data for 1 and 3, where a degree of both G1 and G2/M phase arrest is seen, is consistent with these compounds\u2019 abilities to bind metals. Compound 1 has a low micromolar IC50 in a number of cancer cell lines, which is a potency similar to that of desferrioxamine(40) and tachpyridine.(30) Compound 3 was more potent, and this could be due to an increased affinity for metals. However, it should be noted that the direct involvement of metals in the cytotoxicity of 1\u22123 was not demonstrated, and metal-independent major pleiotropic mechanisms of action for these compounds may exist. In light of previous examples of intricate protection/activation strategies in natural products,(23) a potential hypothesis is that compound 3 may represent an activated form of 1, and this process may constitute a self-resistance strategy by the producing organism. We were unable to convert 1 to 3 under basic conditions, but this does not exclude conversion by a specific enzyme. Compound 3 could also be a minor byproduct of the biosynthesis of 1, or it could be the result of a modified pathway in a minority of cells in the collected material.", "We have described two new cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptides, grassypeptolides B (2) and C (3).
