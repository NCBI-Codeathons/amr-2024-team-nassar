["Abstract", "Herein, we describe a new plasmid found in Sandaracinus\u2005sp. MSr10575 named pSa001 spanning 209.7\u2005kbp that harbors a cryptic secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC). Activation of this BGC by homologous\u2010recombination\u2010mediated exchange of the native promoter sequence against a vanillate inducible system led to the production and subsequent isolation and structure elucidation of novel secondary metabolites, the sandarazols\u2005A\u2013G. The sandarazols contain intriguing structural features and very reactive functional groups such as an \u03b1\u2010chlorinated ketone, an epoxyketone, and a (2R)\u20102\u2010amino\u20103\u2010(N,N\u2010dimethylamino)\u2010propionic acid building block. In\u2010depth investigation of the underlying biosynthetic machinery led to a concise biosynthetic model for the new compound family, including several uncommon biosynthetic steps. The chlorinated congener sandarazol\u2005C shows an IC50\u2005value of 0.5\u2005\u03bcm against HCT\u2005116 cells and a MIC of 14\u2005\u03bcm against Mycobacterium smegmatis, which points at the sandarazols\u2019 potential function as defensive secondary metabolites or toxins.", "Genetic activation artificially induced a plasmid\u2010encoded natural product biosynthetic gene cluster and activated the complex biosynthesis of a previously unknown cytotoxin named sandarazol. Its biosynthesis is unique in featuring the genetic blueprint for the formation of intriguing structural features such as an \u03b1\u2010chlorinated ketone, an epoxyketone, and a rare (2R)\u20102\u2010amino\u20103\u2010(N,N\u2010dimethylamino)\u2010propionic acid building block.", "F.

The only other example of a characterized myxobacterial plasmid is pMF1 from Myxococcus fulvus.\n[20]\n In comparison to pMF1, pSa001 is not only significantly larger, but also encodes a large type\u20051 in\u2010trans acyl transferase (trans\u2010AT) PKS\u2013NRPS hybrid BGC, which was named sandarazol (szo) BGC (see SI). Besides the szo BGC, the plasmid contains five ORFs encoding putative transposases and one ORF encoding a putative integrase indicating its ability to integrate into (or transfer parts of its sequence into) foreign bacterial genomes after conjugation. It might thus serve as a BGC shuttle vector for horizontal gene transfer of the BGC. Cultivation of wild\u2010type MSr10575 followed by extraction and liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS2) analysis and GNPS based spectral networking of the bacterial metabolome did not reveal a family of secondary metabolites matching the BGC architecture on the plasmid in expected secondary metabolite size and fragmentation pattern (see SI).\n[21]\n We therefore assumed the plasmid borne szo BGC to be \u201ccryptic\u201d as seen in many other cases such as the pyxidicyclines or taromycin.[\n22\n, \n23\n] All the coding regions in the szo cluster spanning from szoA to szoO are encoded on the same DNA strand and the intergenic regions seemed too small to contain important elements other than ribosome binding sites.

This plasmid featuring the pBeloBac replication machinery and a kanamycin resistance in its backbone was named pBeloBac\u2010TransAT (see SI). Promoter exchange of the szo cluster's native promoter against the vanillate cassette is achieved by homologous recombination of pBeloBac\u2010TransAT with the pSa001 plasmid after electroporation (Figure\u20051). MSr10575 clones harboring the recombined fused plasmid called pBeloBacSa001 were selected on 25\u2005\u03bcg\u2009mL\u22121 kanamycin and genotypically verified by PCR (see SI).
