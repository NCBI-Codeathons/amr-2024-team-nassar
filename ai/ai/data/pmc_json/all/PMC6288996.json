However, the roles of MDSCs in autoimmune arthritis are not completely understood. Indeed, their immunosuppressive functions in arthritic conditions remain controversial, with heterogeneity among MDSCs and differential effects among subpopulations receiving much attention. As a result, it is necessary to determine the roles of MDSC subpopulations in autoimmune arthritis to clarify their diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Interestingly, in the inflammation niche of autoimmune arthritis, each MDSC subpopulation can exhibit both alternatives of a given characteristic. Moreover, polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) are likely to be more suppressive and stable compared with monocytic MDSCs (MO-MDSCs). Although various important cytokines associated with the differentiation of MDSCs or MDSC subpopulations from immature myeloid precursors, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), have been largely applied in external inductive systems, their roles are not entirely clear. Moreover, MDSC-based clinical treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) continue to represent a significant challenge, as also reported for other autoimmune diseases. In this review, we describe the effects and actions of MDSC subpopulations on the development of autoimmune arthritis and analyze several types of MDSC-based therapeutic strategies to provide comprehensive information regarding immune networks and a foundation for more effective protocols for autoimmune arthritis.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by multiple invasive and symmetrical joint inflammation and organic dysfunction (1). Abnormal interactions among inflammatory cells, such as Th17 cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), fibroblasts and osteoclasts, in inflamed tissues significantly contribute to the occurrence and evolution of autoimmune arthritis, mainly through molecular docking or the release of active products (2). Among CD4+ T cell subpopulations, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) represent a limited valuable subpopulation in RA treatment, and the balance of Th17 cells and Tregs is an important factor associated with the development of inflammation (1, 3). Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) comprise a group of highly heterogeneous cells derived from immature myeloid progenitors that are typically divided into two subpopulations: polymorphonuclear (PMN-MDSCs) and monocytic (MO-MDSCs) MDSCs (4\u20136). Although numerous reports have demonstrated the potent immunosuppression effects of MDSCs under abnormal conditions, the roles of MDSCs and their subpopulations in autoimmune arthritis remain unclear. As research about MDSCs in arthritis progresses, differences in the roles and actions of MDSC subpopulations have stimulated growing interest among researchers. In this review, we summarize the current research findings of MDSC subpopulations in autoimmune arthritis and evaluate the prospects of their application.", "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by multiple invasive and symmetrical joint inflammation and organic dysfunction (1).

Effects include the following: direct or indirect suppression of CD4+T cell activation, proliferation or migration; cooperation with Tregs; and communication with multiple mature myeloid cells or tumor cells (37, 39). Arg-1, an enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of L-arginine (40), is more frequently utilized by PMN-MDSCs to block normal signal activation of T cells by directly inhibiting formation of the cyclin D3 (CD3 \u03b6) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 complex due to arginine deficiency (41, 42). ROS, including superoxide anion and NO, also contribute to PMN-MDSC-mediated interruption of T cell proliferation (36, 43, 44). iNOS promotes decreased expression of signal transduction, activation of transcription 5 (STAT5) in MO-MDSCs and MHC II in inflammatory cells (36, 45, 46). Moreover, human MDSCs potently inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro (47\u201349).

At later stages, the induction ability of IFN-\u03b3 released from T cells was lost, with arg-1 playing more important roles in the inhibition process than NO (55). Moreover, the role of MDSCs in T cell suppression was found to be reduced after the onset of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) (14).

CD14++CD16\u2212 monocytes (classical monocytes), an important human monocyte subpopulation with CD11b expression, represent a main subpopulation of extravascular tissue monocytes (94, 95).

Some markers on MO-MDSCs are co-expressed with classical monocytes, such as F4/80, CD115, CD62L, and CCR2 (8, 14, 62).

However, it remains unclear whether any subpopulation becomes more suppressive as a result of the inflammatory niche. Adoptive transfer of PMN-MDSCs but not MO-MDSCs effectively relieves joint damage in CIA mice. Moreover, T cell proliferation and responses were reported to be more potently suppressed by PMN-MDSCs than by MO-MDSCs, which likely related to IL-10, TGF-\u03b21, CCR5, and CXCR2 (10). Furthermore, PMN-MDSCs more effectively suppress Th17 cell differentiation than MO-MDSCs do (62). The increased therapeutic efficacy and suppressive potential of PMN-MDSCs were also demonstrated in asthmatic mice, which was likely due to Treg cell differentiation and arg-1 production (98).

It is abundant in the SF and synovial membranes of RA patients, which is vital for the activation of macrophages (100). As a result, it is important to determine whether MO-MDSCs are steadily maintained under the effects of cytokines, such as GM-CSF, involved in the inflamed joints of autoimmune arthritis or in secondary lymphoid organs, weakening them or rendering them unable to inhibit CD4+T cell immune responses.

It was widely reported that CD8+ Tregs were potently suppressive in tumors (107, 108), infectious diseases (109, 110), graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) (111, 112) and autoimmune diseases such as SLE (113), MS (114), and experiment allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) (115) mainly by strong inhibitions of CD4+T cell proliferations especially for Th1 cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokine productions via the releases of soluble cytokines or co-stimulator expression. In CIA models, CD8+ Tregs also showed a powerful suppression contributing to anti-CD3 mAb-improved arthritis and suggested a more potent capability than CD4+ Tregs in the suppression of IL-17 production. Importantly, one report in GVHD revealed a close connection between CD8+Foxp3+Tregs and MDSCs that the former could be induced to contribute the alleviation of GVHD mediated by MDSCs (109) as well as CD4+ Tregs.

Otherwise, it is likely that internal interactions would be made use of in autoimmune diseases among these suppressive cells such as tolerogenic DCs and Foxp3+ Tregs (152, 153), MDSCs and Tregs (66, 73, 98), which suggests a considerable therapeutic strategy by combined transfer application of immunosuppressive cells for clinical treatments of autoimmune diseases.", "Notably, before clinical applications of these immunosuppressive cell treatments, length of curative effects, dose and frequency of injections were supposed to be extremely focused according to experience from preclinical and clinical cytokine treatments (2), which correlated closely with infectious risk and relapse problems.

Both MDSC subpopulations play important roles in regulating the proliferation, response and differentiation of CD4+ T cells during the progression of autoimmune arthritis. However, the maturation potential of these cells should not be ignored. Some reports demonstrate more potent inhibition of arthritis inflammation by PMN-MDSCs compared with MO-MDSCs, and the specific local microenvironment is important for MDSC subpopulations in autoimmune arthritis. Double-edged roles of MDSC subpopulations might depend on inflammatory systems or their various differentiation stages caused by dynamically altered microenvironments during arthritis progression. As exosomes derived from MDSCs are responsible for regulating immune function in immunocytes, exploring potent communication mechanisms of inhibitory MDSC subpopulations to discover more about MDSC-derived exosomes and target functional pathways for the clinical treatment of RNA represent important goals in the coming years.", "Circumstantial findings substantiate the important and controversial roles of MDSC subpopulations in autoimmune arthritis and other inflammation-related diseases (116).
