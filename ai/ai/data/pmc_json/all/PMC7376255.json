["The streptomycetes are soil-dwelling bacteria that are found in soil everywhere on Earth: the molecule geosmin, which they produce as part of their life cycle, is what gives soil its familiar \u2018earthy\u2019 smell. The species is best known for the production of biologically active small molecules called \u2018natural products\u2019. These molecules are the source of most of our antibiotics and anti-fungals, as well as many other drugs. The streptomycetes have a filamentous form rather than the more familiar rod-shaped spirochete and coccoid forms. They exhibit a complex life cycle and sporulation mechanism involving several differentiated cell types, each having specific roles in the colony life history. \nStreptomyces coelicolor\n is an important model system for this genus \u2013 research on this bacterium has provided foundational information for all of these fascinating processes.", "Taxonomy", "Taxonomy", "Phylum, Actinomybacteria; class, \nActinobacteria\n; order, \nActinomycetales\n; family, \nStreptomycetaceae\n; genus, \nStreptomyces\n; species, \nStreptomyces coelicolor\n A3(2) \u2013 see http://StrepDB.streptomyces.org.uk.

A second filamentous cell type, the \u2018aerial hyphae\u2019, grows into the air, conferring a white, fuzzy appearance to the colony surface. In contrast to the substrate hyphae, aerial hyphae undergo a concerted round of septation that divides them into compartments, each having one chromosome. These compartments then develop into spores. Many steps in this life cycle are marked by brilliant pigmentation. Thus, the substrate hyphae produce blue (actinorhodin), red (undecylprodigeosin) and yellow (coelimycin) specialized metabolites, while the completion of spore maturation is marked by the deposition of a grey pigment in the spore walls.
