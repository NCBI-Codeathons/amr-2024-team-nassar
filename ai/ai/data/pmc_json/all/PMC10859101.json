["Abstract", "The rapid spread of multidrug resistance (MDR), due to abusive use of antibiotics has led to global health emergency, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Bacteria attain MDR by different means such as antibiotic modification/degradation, target protection/modification/bypass, and enhanced efflux mechanisms. The classical approaches of counteracting MDR bacteria are expensive and time-consuming, thus, it is highly significant to understand the molecular mechanisms of this resistance to curb the problem from core level. The revolutionary approach of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated sequence 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), considered as a next-generation genome-editing tool presents an innovative opportunity to precisely target and edit bacterial genome to alter their MDR strategy. Different bacteria possessing antibiotic resistance genes such as mecA, ermB, ramR, tetA, mqrB and blaKPC that have been targeted by CRISPR/Cas9 to re-sensitize these pathogens against antibiotics, such as methicillin, erythromycin, tigecycline, colistin and carbapenem, respectively. The CRISPR/Cas9 from S. pyogenes is the most widely studied genome-editing tool, consisting of a Cas9 DNA endonuclease associated with tracrRNA and crRNA, which can be systematically coupled as sgRNA. The targeting strategies of CRISPR/Cas9 to bacterial cells is mediated through phage, plasmids, vesicles and nanoparticles. However, the targeting approaches of this genome-editing tool to specific bacteria is a challenging task and still remains at a very preliminary stage due to numerous obstacles awaiting to be\u00a0solved. This review elaborates some recent updates about the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and the innovative role of CRISPR/Cas9 system in modulating these resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, the delivery approaches of this genome-editing system in bacterial cells are discussed. In addition, some challenges and future prospects are also described.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Since the discovery of antibiotics in 1928, commonly used as a weapon of choice against infections, the frequency of antibiotic-resistant infections are increasing rapidly.
