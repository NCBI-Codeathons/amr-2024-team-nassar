["Topoisomerase IB (Top1) inhibitors, such as camptothecin (CPT), stabilize the Top1-DNA cleavage complex in a DNA sequence-dependent manner. The sequence selectivity of Top1 inhibitors is important for targeting specific genomic sequences of therapeutic value. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this selectivity remain largely unknown. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to delineate structural, dynamic and energetic features that contribute to the differential sequence selectivity of the Top1 inhibitors. We found the sequence selectivity of CPT to be highly correlated with the drug binding energies, dynamic and structural properties of the linker domain. Chemical insights, gained by per-residue binding energy analysis revealed that the non-polar interaction between CPT and nucleotide at the +1 position of the cleavage site was the major (favorable) contributor to the total binding energy. Mechanistic insights gained by a potential of mean force analysis implicated that the drug dissociation step was associated with the sequence selectivity. Pharmaceutical insights gained by our molecular dynamics analyses explained why LMP-776, an indenoisoquinoline derivative under clinical development at the National Institutes of Health, displays different sequence selectivity when compared with camptothecin and its clinical derivatives.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Topoisomerase IB (Top1) is an essential enzyme required for DNA replication and RNA transcription. Top1 is composed of 765 amino acids and has four distinct domains: the NH2-terminal domain (1-214), the core domain (215-635), the linker (636-712) and the COOH-terminal domain (713-765). The Top1 enzyme catalyzes the relaxation of DNA superhelicity by reversibly nicking one strand of DNA to generate a Top1-DNA cleavage complex that allows controlled DNA swiveling. Top1 inhibitors act as interfacial inhibitors (1). They intercalate into the DNA base pairs at the cleavage site and form specific hydrogen bonds with Top1 to stabilize the Top1-DNA-inhibitor ternary complex (Figure 1A). The stabilized ternary complex produces collisions with replication and transcription forks leading to DNA double strand breaks and cell death (Supplementary Scheme S1) (2). The discovery and development of Top1 inhibitors as anticancer drugs is one of the significant achievements in cancer chemotherapy (3,4). Topotecan and irinotecan, analogs of the natural alkaloid camptothecin (CPTs, Supplementary Chart S1), have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian and colon cancers, respectively. The CPT class of anticancer drugs targets only Top1 and the poisoning of Top1-DNA cleavage complexes occurs only at specific cleavage sites along the DNA chain. This sequence selectivity is a key step in preferentially directing the action of drugs onto specific genomic sequences of therapeutic interest (5\u20138). The sequence selectivity exhibited by Top1 inhibitors is \u2018intrinsically\u2019 dependent on the base sequences immediately preceding (\u22121) and following (+1) the cleavage site. CPT binding has a strict requirement for T at the \u22121 site and G at the +1 site (9). Analysis of sequence selectivity around Top1 cleavage sites in SV40 DNA and 30mer duplex oligonucleotides indicated that CPT action is strongly dependent on the base pair at the +1 position (9\u201312). Recent reports showed that CPT interfered with transcription regulation in a sequence-selective manner, leading to alterations in gene expression that may be relevant for cancer therapy (13,14). However, the biochemical and biophysical determinants underlying the sequence selectivity remains unclear.\nFigure 1.(A) Schematic diagram of a Top1-DNA-inhibitor ternary complex.

Second, the experimental frequencies of cleavage sites correlate strongly with the total binding energies (R2 = 0.8, Table 1). To probe properties that underpin the sequence selectivity, we identified their correlations with various per-residue decomposition energies (Table 1).

An indenoisoquinoline NSC725776 (LMP-776, Supplementary Chart S1) is currently in clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health (USA). The DNA cleavage pattern induced by LMP-776 is different from that of CPT. Notably, LMP-776 prefers a cleavage site at the CG site [site 44 in the original article (3,63)], rather than the TG site (the preferred site of CPT).", "Having established the driving force for the site selectivity of CPT, we extended our study to non-CPTs, with an aim to evaluate the potential application of MD approach for studying the site selectivity of non-CPT Top1 poisons (59). CPTs have several undesirable properties, including E-ring inactivation by lactone ring opening, affinity for cellular efflux transporters and relatively high toxicity, which limits their therapeutic index. Non-CPT Top1 inhibitors could have distinct pharmacological activities because they target distinct genomic sites due to their different sequence selectivity; they also overcome the chemical instability of CPT and lead to distinct pharmacological activity (59\u201362).

Notably, LMP-776 prefers a cleavage site at the CG site [site 44 in the original article (3,63)], rather than the TG site (the preferred site of CPT).", "In the present study, we compared the ternary complexes of LMP-776 bound with Top1-DNA complexes with CG versus TG as the cleavage sites (referred to as LMP_CG and LMP_TG, Figure 5). In agreement with the trend observed in CPT, the drug binding energy of the LMP_CG complex (\u221260.6 kcal mol\u22121) was more favorable than the binding energy of the LMP_TG complex (\u221254.3 kcal mol\u22121). The flexibility of the linker domain of LMP_CG (2.7 \u00c5) was also lower than that of LMP_TG (2.9 \u00c5, Figure 5B). In addition, the DNA-linker angle (\u03b8) of the LMP_CG (14\u00b0) complex was significantly smaller (t-test: P < 1E-5) than that of the LMP_TG complex (29\u00b0, Figure 5C). Collectively, LMP-776 is consistent with CPT that sequence selectivity was governed by drug binding energies, flexibility of the linker domain and the DNA-linker angle. To target specific genomic sequences of therapeutic value, developing top1 inhibitors with different preference on the cleavage site is of high importance. Determining the base frequencies of various top1 inhibitors experimentally is time-consuming and tremendous. We have illustrated that the MD approach reported in the present study can be used to study the sequence selectivity of CPT and non-CPTs. We envision MD approach can be used to in silico screen compounds that target specific genomic sequences.\nFigure 5.Data for LMP-776 (NSC725776).
