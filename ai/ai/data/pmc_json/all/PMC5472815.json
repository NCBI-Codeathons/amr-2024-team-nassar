Reclassification of the specialized metabolite producer Pseudomonas mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 as a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. J Bacteriol 199:e00125-17. https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00125-17.", "ABSTRACT", "Pseudomonas mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 is a Gram-negative bacterium, first isolated from Japanese soil samples, that produces the monobactam isosulfazecin and the \u03b2-lactam-potentiating bulgecins. To characterize the biosynthetic potential of P. mesoacidophila ATCC 31433, its complete genome was determined using single-molecule real-time DNA sequence analysis. The 7.8-Mb genome comprised four replicons, three chromosomal (each encoding rRNA) and one plasmid. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that P. mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 was misclassified at the time of its deposition and is a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, most closely related to Burkholderia ubonensis. The sequenced genome shows considerable additional biosynthetic potential; known gene clusters for malleilactone, ornibactin, isosulfazecin, alkylhydroxyquinoline, and pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis and several uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters for polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and other metabolites were identified. Furthermore, P. mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 harbors many genes associated with environmental resilience and antibiotic resistance and was resistant to a range of antibiotics and metal ions. In summary, this bioactive strain should be designated B. cepacia complex strain ATCC 31433, pending further detailed taxonomic characterization.", "IMPORTANCE This work reports the complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas mesoacidophila ATCC 31433, a known producer of bioactive compounds. Large numbers of both known and novel biosynthetic gene clusters were identified, indicating that P. mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 is an untapped resource for discovery of novel bioactive compounds. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that P. mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 is in fact a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, most closely related to the species Burkholderia ubonensis. Further investigation of the classification and biosynthetic potential of P. mesoacidophila ATCC 31433 is warranted.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Pseudomonas mesoacidophila was isolated from Japanese soil samples in the late 1970s (1). It is known to produce the sulfamate monobactam isosulfazecin (1) and the bulgecins (2), a group of sulfated glycopeptides that inhibit lytic transglycosylases (3) and metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (4) and potentiate \u03b2-lactam activity (2, 5). Pseudomonas and other soil Gram-negative bacterial genera, such as Stenotrophomonas and Burkholderia, often show high levels of resistance to antibiotics (6). For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common nosocomial pathogen with reduced susceptibility to a range of antibiotics, due to low membrane permeability, chromosomal multidrug efflux pumps, overexpressed \u03b2-lactamases, and the acquisition of multidrug resistance plasmids (6, 7). Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen (8), and several Burkholderia species, even environmental isolates, are resistant to a wide range of antibiotic classes (9). Species of both Pseudomonas and Burkholderia produce an array of specialized bioactive metabolites (10, 11). Despite these findings, the full biosynthetic potential and antibiotic susceptibility of P. mesoacidophila have not been reported. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of P. mesoacidophila, and we show that this species shares an antimicrobial-resistant phenotype characteristic of Burkholderia and should be reclassified phylogenetically as a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex.", "Pseudomonas mesoacidophila was isolated from Japanese soil samples in the late 1970s (1).

Three hours after the addition of cefoxitin, a 25-ml aliquot was removed from each flask and the cells were lysed by sonication. The crude cellular lysate (100 \u03bcl) was then added to 200 \u03bcM nitrocefin solution in 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 \u03bcM ZnCl2 and 150 mM NaCl (900 \u03bcl), and the initial rate of hydrolysis was recorded by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 482 nm.
