It produces four different types of terminal oxidases for aerobic respiration, and for one of these, the cbb3-type terminal oxidases, it has the capacity to produce at least 16 isoforms encoded by partially redundant operons. It also produces small-molecule virulence factors that interact with the respiratory chain, including the poison cyanide. Previous studies had indicated a role for cyanide in activating expression of an \u201corphan\u201d terminal oxidase subunit gene called ccoN4 and that the product contributes to P. aeruginosa cyanide resistance, fitness in biofilms, and virulence, but the mechanisms underlying this process had not been elucidated. Here, we show that the regulatory protein MpaR, which is predicted to be a pyridoxal phosphate-binding transcription factor and is encoded just upstream of ccoN4, controls ccoN4 expression in response to endogenous cyanide. Paradoxically, we find that cyanide production is required to support CcoN4\u2019s contribution to respiration in biofilms. We identify a palindromic motif required for cyanide- and MpaR-dependent expression of ccoN4 and co-expressed adjacent loci. We also characterize the regulatory logic of this region of the chromosome. Finally, we identify residues in the putative cofactor-binding pocket of MpaR, which are required for ccoN4 expression. Together, our findings illustrate a novel scenario in which the respiratory toxin cyanide acts as a signal to control gene expression in a bacterium that produces the compound endogenously.", "IMPORTANCE", "IMPORTANCE", "Cyanide is an inhibitor of heme-copper oxidases, which are required for aerobic respiration in all eukaryotes and many prokaryotes. This fast-acting poison can arise from diverse sources, but mechanisms by which bacteria sense it are poorly understood. We investigated the regulatory response to cyanide in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which produces cyanide as a virulence factor. Although P. aeruginosa has the capacity to produce a cyanide-resistant oxidase, it relies primarily on heme-copper oxidases and even makes additional heme-copper oxidase proteins specifically under cyanide-producing conditions. We found that the protein MpaR controls expression of cyanide-inducible genes in P. aeruginosa and elucidated the molecular details of this regulation. MpaR contains a DNA-binding domain and a domain predicted to bind pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6), a compound that is known to react spontaneously with cyanide. These observations provide insight into the understudied phenomenon of cyanide-dependent regulation of gene expression in bacteria.", "Cyanide is an inhibitor of heme-copper oxidases, which are required for aerobic respiration in all eukaryotes and many prokaryotes.

As a biofilm grows, internal chemical gradients become established because (i) cells near the biofilm edge consume substrates such as O2 before these resources can travel through the structure and (ii) cells in separate biofilm subregions release distinct products.

Depending on the growth conditions, it can synthesize four major types of terminal oxidases, i.e., enzyme complexes that catalyze the final step of aerobic respiration, including high-affinity cbb3-type oxidases (\u201cCcos\u201d). The production of small molecules that interact with the respiratory chain is generally controlled by quorum-sensing pathways and/or regulators that respond to low-oxygen conditions (7, 10, 11). Among these compounds are the P. aeruginosa phenazines, a class of redox-cycling compounds that have been implicated in anaerobic survival (12, 13) and in electron transfer by the respiratory chain (9, 14). Together, the terminal oxidases and phenazines provide extensive and varied potential routes of metabolic electron flow for P. aeruginosa cells in biofilms. Adding to this complexity is the fact that P. aeruginosa has the capacity to produce cyanide, a potent inhibitor of heme-copper oxidases including cbb3-type oxidases (15\u201318). These observations raise questions about how P. aeruginosa mediates electron flow when O2 limitation and cyanide production threaten respiratory function.", "The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known for its respiratory versatility and its production of small molecules that interact with the respiratory chain (6\u20139).

One of genes, ccoN4, encodes a so-called \u201corphan\u201d Cco subunit that contributes to wild-type (WT) biofilm formation and competitive fitness in biofilms (14). ccoN4 is part of a cluster that is strongly induced by cyanide (20). At first, it seems odd that cyanide induces ccoN4 expression because cyanide is known for its specific inhibition of oxidases like the Ccos (21). Nevertheless, studies have shown that ccoN4 contributes to resistance when exogenous cyanide is added to liquid cultures (19, 20). Although P. aeruginosa can produce a cyanide-insensitive oxidase (CIO) that does not contain a heme-copper center, a drawback to the use of this oxidase is that it has a low affinity for O2 relative to the Cco complexes. Moreover, viability studies have shown that CIO is not the sole contributor to P. aeruginosa cyanide resistance (19, 22). These observations suggest that the CcoN4 subunit is functional in the presence of cyanide and that its use may be preferred when high O2 affinity is beneficial such as in hypoxic biofilm settings.", "The P. aeruginosa genome contains multiple, differentially regulated genetic loci that produce full or partial Cco complexes, with functionally interchangeable subunits (19) (Fig. 1A and B).

We focused our analysis on the top 150 \u00b5m of the biofilm, which includes the transition from oxic to anoxic subzones (14), because the syntheses of cyanide and some terminal oxidases are O2 regulated (10, 26, 28). In the WT background, the ccoN4 transcriptional reporter showed high levels of expression across most of the biofilm depth, with a reproducible peak in expression at a depth of 40\u201350 \u00b5m (Fig. 2B). ccoN4 expression across depth was greatly reduced in the cyanide-null background.

Among these, cyanide is noteworthy because it is volatile and a potent inhibitor of heme-copper oxidases, which are common components of mitochondrial, bacterial, and archaeal respiratory chains (21, 53, 54). P. aeruginosa cyanide production is particularly enigmatic because this bacterium is known for its proficient use of O2 as a terminal electron acceptor and because it contains six distinct operons encoding subunits of heme-copper oxidases (26, 55). Although P. aeruginosa can also produce a cyanide-insensitive (copper free) oxidase, growth and survival experiments indicate that this oxidase is not necessary for protection against endogenous cyanide under physiological conditions (22, 25). Counterintuitively, P. aeruginosa shows strong induction of ccoN4, encoding a heme-copper oxidase subunit, when treated with cyanide (20). Experiments with exogenously added cyanide suggest that, even though CcoN4-containing oxidases are predicted to be cyanide sensitive (19), this subunit acts synergistically with the cyanide-insensitive oxidase to confer cyanide resistance (20).", "P. aeruginosa releases chemically diverse small molecules that have physiological effects not only on other organisms, including hosts, but also on their producer (52).

Five microliters were spotted onto 60-mL 1% tryptone 1% agar (Teknova, A7777) square 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm plates and incubated for 72 hours at 25\u00b0C. Biofilms were collected into 1 mL of PBS and were physically disrupted by pipetting. Pellets were collected and washed twice more with PBS before resuspending in 500-\u00b5L Mass Spec Lysis Buffer (8 M urea, 75 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Samples were sonicated on ice using the microtip of a Branson Sonifier 250 (50% duty cycle 50% output) for 90 seconds (30-second sonication, 1-minute rest three times). Samples were clarified by centrifugation for 20,000 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes, and the protein content of the supernatant was measured by Qubit. Forty micrograms of protein for each sample were reduced with a final concentration of 5 mM dithriothreitol (DTT) for 45 minutes at room temperature and then alkylated with a final concentration of 10 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 45 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Samples were diluted with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) such that the final concentration of urea was less than 2 M. Samples were digested overnight with 0.4 \u00b5g trypsin (Promega, V5113) for a 1:100 enzyme to protein ratio. After 16 hours of digestion, samples were acidified with 1% formic acid (final concentration). Tryptic peptides were desalted on C18 StageTips according to reference (90) and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator.
