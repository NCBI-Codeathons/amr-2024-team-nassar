["The Neurospora crassa nuclear aod-1 gene encodes an alternative oxidase that functions in mitochondria. The enzyme provides a branch from the standard electron transport chain by transferring electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen. In standard laboratory strains, aod-1 is transcribed at very low levels under normal growth conditions. However, if the standard electron transport chain is disrupted, aod-1 mRNA expression is induced and the AOD1 protein is produced. We previously identified a strain of N. crassa, that produces high levels of aod-1 transcript under non-inducing conditions. Here we have crossed this strain to a standard lab strain and determined the genomic sequences of the parents and several progeny. Analysis of the sequence data and the levels of aod-1 mRNA in uninduced cultures revealed that a frameshift mutation in the flbA gene results in the high uninduced expression of aod-1. The flbA gene encodes a regulator of G protein signaling that decreases the activity of the G\u03b1 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. Our data suggest that strains with a functional flbA gene prevent uninduced expression of aod-1 by inactivating a G protein signaling pathway, and that this pathway is activated in cells grown under conditions that induce aod-1. Induced cells with a deletion of the gene encoding the G\u03b1 protein still have a partial increase in aod-1 mRNA levels, suggesting a second pathway for inducing transcription of the gene in N. crassa. We also present evidence that a translational control mechanism prevents production of AOD1 protein in uninduced cultures.", "Mitochondria contain proteins encoded by both nuclear DNA and mtDNA. To achieve proper mitochondrial biogenesis, communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus is required to coordinate the expression of genes found in the two organelles. Since the vast majority of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are found in the nucleus, changes in the functional status of mitochondria must be communicated to the nucleus to modulate the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins according to specific conditions. Communication from the mitochondria to the nucleus has been termed retrograde regulation and has been shown to occur in many organisms (Liu and Butow 2006; Jazwinski 2013; da Cunha et al. 2015; Cardamone et al. 2018; Guaragnella et al. 2018; Isaac et al. 2018).", "The alternative oxidase (AOX) is a mitochondrial enzyme that is encoded in the nucleus. AOX transfers electrons from ubiquinol directly to molecular oxygen, thus bypassing complexes III and IV of the standard electron transport chain (Vanlerberghe and McIntosh 1997; Joseph-Horne et al. 2001; McDonald 2008; Nargang and Kennell 2010; Vanlerberghe 2013). It is an interfacial membrane protein that localizes to the inner leaflet of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Moore et al. 2013; Shiba et al. 2013; May et al. 2017). AOX is present in a wide range of species although it has not been identified in any higher animal (McDonald and Vanlerberghe 2006; McDonald 2008; McDonald 2009; Neimanis et al. 2013). In many organisms a variety of factors that affect mitochondrial function can induce transcription of the gene to high levels (Vanlerberghe and McIntosh 1997; Joseph-Horne et al. 2001; McDonald 2008; Nargang and Kennell 2010; Vanlerberghe 2013). Thus, AOX serves as an excellent system for the study of retrograde regulation since disruption of mitochondrial function results in increased expression of the nuclear gene encoding AOX.", "We have studied the regulation of AOX production in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. The organism contains two genes encoding AOX called aod-1 and aod-3, although no conditions have been found that result in expression of aod-3 (Tanton et al. 2003). In standard laboratory strains the aod-1 gene is transcribed at very low levels when the organism is grown in normal growth media. However, induction of aod-1 transcription and translation of the mRNA occurs when cells are grown in the presence of inhibitors that affect the function of the standard mitochondrial electron transport chain, such as antimycin A or cyanide (Lambowitz and Slayman 1971; Henry and Nyns 1975; Bertrand et al. 1983; Lambowitz et al. 1989; Tanton et al. 2003). The expression of aod-1 and production of the AOD1 protein are also increased in strains carrying mutations that affect standard electron transport chain function (Tissieres et al. 1953; Lambowitz et al. 1972; Bertrand et al. 1983; Li et al. 1996). Growth in the presence of chloramphenicol (Cm) also increases aod-1 expression since it indirectly affects the standard electron transport chain by inhibiting mitochondrial (but not cytosolic) protein synthesis, thus reducing the levels of standard electron transport chain complexes that contain mitochondrial-encoded subunits (Lambowitz and Slayman 1971; Nargang and Kennell 2010).", "In N. crassa, several genes required for aod-1 expression have been identified (Bertrand et al. 1983; Descheneau et al. 2005; Nargang et al. 2012). The best studied of these are called aod-2 and aod-5. Gene rescue experiments, sequencing, and bioinformatics revealed that aod-2 and aod-5 encode zinc cluster transcription factors (Chae et al. 2007b). These factors bind constitutively as a heterodimer to an alternative oxidase induction motif (AIM) that exists in the promoter region of the aod-1 gene (Chae et al. 2007a; Qi et al. 2017). Transcription of aod-1 is induced in response to an unknown signal(s) generated when the standard electron transport chain is disrupted. In the absence of either aod-2 or aod-5, the induction of aod-1 is essentially eliminated (Tanton et al. 2003; Chae et al. 2007a; Chae et al. 2007b; Chae and Nargang 2009; Qi et al. 2017). Orthologs of the AOD2 and AOD5 proteins exist in other fungi and have been shown to be required for AOX induction in Aspergillus nidulans (Suzuki et al. 2012) and Podospora anserina (Bovier et al. 2014). Thus, the AOD2 and AOD5 proteins are directly involved in control of aod-1 expression.", "However, there is evidence that additional factors play a role in aod-1 expression. Several other genes were identified as being required for full aod-1 expression during an examination of the N. crassa single gene deletion library (Colot et al. 2006; Nargang et al. 2012) and in a genetic screen for regulatory mutants unable to induce the enzyme (Descheneau et al. 2005). Furthermore, during the development of a reporter strain for use in the screen for regulatory mutants, we serendipitously identified a N. crassa strain (called T1P11) carrying a mutant tyrosinase gene that consistently had high levels of aod-1 mRNA in non-inducing conditions, though no AOD1 protein was produced (Descheneau et al. 2005). Although the tyrosinase gene is required for the synthesis of melanin (Kupper et al. 1989) it was conceivable that loss of the gene might affect aod-1 transcript levels. To determine if the tyrosinase mutation was responsible for the upregulation, a cross between T1P11 and a wild-type strain with low levels of uninduced transcript (NCN233) was performed. Analysis of the progeny revealed that the tyrosinase mutation and the high levels of uninduced aod-1 transcripts segregated independently (Descheneau et al. 2005). In the present work we have confirmed this result and have shown that other genes known to affect aod-1 expression are not altered in T1P11. To identify the gene(s) causing the effect, we determined the genomic sequence of T1P11, NCN233, and progeny from a cross between these two strains. Our analysis revealed that a frameshift mutation in a the flbA gene, which encodes a Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS protein), is responsible for the increased expression of aod-1 in non-inducing conditions.", "Materials and Methods", "Materials and Methods", "Handling and growth of N. crassa strains", "Handling and growth of N. crassa strains", "Handling and growth of N. crassa strains", "Table 1 lists the strains used in this study.

Why were relatively high levels of aod-1 mRNA produced in the absence of inducing conditions in this strain and; why was no AOD1 protein observed in the strain as a result of the high levels of mRNA?", "Previously, analysis of a cross between T1P11 and a strain (NCN233) with a wild type tyrosinase gene, and the typically low levels of uninduced aod-1 mRNA, showed that the high uninduced aod-1 transcript levels in T1P11 did not segregate with the mutant allele of the tyrosinase gene (Descheneau et al. 2005). However, following this previous analysis, the progeny of this original cross were lost. To verify the previous data, and to generate strains for further analysis, we repeated the cross and analyzed 11 progeny strains. The presence of the T- or T+ allele was evaluated in the progeny by PCR amplification and sequencing of the region of the T gene known to contain mutations induced by repeat induced point mutation (Selker 1990) in the T- allele (Descheneau et al. 2005). Progeny strains (referred to by their isolation numbers) 3, 4, 19, 34, and 36 were wild-type (T+) for the tyrosinase gene, while strains 6, 9, 16, 23, 26, and 33 carried the mutated (T-) allele of the tyrosinase gene (Table 1).", "Previously, analysis of a cross between T1P11 and a strain (NCN233) with a wild type tyrosinase gene, and the typically low levels of uninduced aod-1 mRNA, showed that the high uninduced aod-1 transcript levels in T1P11 did not segregate with the mutant allele of the tyrosinase gene (Descheneau et al. 2005).

As shown in Figure 1A, the control strain contained roughly ten-fold the amount of aod-1 mRNA when grown in inducing conditions (+Cm) relative to non-inducing (-Cm) conditions. However, uninduced cultures of strain T1P11 contained levels of mRNA approaching the induced level in control cells. Furthermore, induced T1P11 cultures had about three times more aod-1 mRNA than induced control cells. Examination of AOD1 protein levels in the parental strains confirmed that no AOD1 protein could be detected in uninduced T1P11, despite the high levels of aod-1 mRNA in these cells (Figure 1B). We also showed that the increased level of mRNA seen in induced T1P11 cells gave rise to more AOD1 protein than found in induced control cells (Figure 1B). For the progeny strains there was a range of uninduced mRNA expression levels. We arbitrarily defined progeny that had greater than 3.5 times the level of aod-1 mRNA present in uninduced control cells as having \u201chigh\u201d expression (progeny strains 9, 16, 19, 23 and 26), while progeny with below 3.5 times the level of uninduced control cell mRNA were designated as having \u201clow\u201d expression (progeny strains 3, 4, 6, 33, 34, 36). With respect to the traits of tyrosinase (T+or T-) and aod-1 mRNA levels (high or low), the cross yielded four parental, high aod-1 mRNA, T- progeny (9, 16, 23 and 26) and four parental, low aod-1 mRNA T+ progeny (3, 4, 34, and 36). However, recombinant types were also recovered. Strain 19, which is T+, had elevated levels of aod-1 transcript, while strains 6 and 33, which are T-, had low levels of aod-1 transcript (Figure 1, Table 1). These data agree with the previous conclusion that the state of the tyrosinase gene is not responsible for the uninduced high level of expression of aod-1 that is observed in some strains (Descheneau et al. 2005). In addition, although the number of progeny analyzed was low, the finding that six progeny had low levels of aod-1 transcripts, while five had high levels, suggested that the expression level phenotype is determined by a single gene. However, given the arbitrary designation of high and low expression, and the low number of progeny examined, we cannot exclude the possibility that more than one gene may contribute to uninduced aod-1 expression.", "We then determined the levels of aod-1 mRNA present in the parental and progeny strains by qPCR.

All four changes were present in the kin-9 allele of the T1P11 parental strain of the cross and the progeny that inherited that allele. Three of these were single nucleotide G to A changes in the 3\u2032UTR. The fourth was also a G to A transition that occurred in the coding region of exon 3 or 4, depending on the splice variant considered.

FlbA is an RGS protein that interacts with the G\u03b1 protein of heterotrimeric G proteins. G protein signaling is known to play a role in a number of cellular processes in a large number of organisms (Neves et al. 2002; Li et al. 2007; Syrovatkina et al. 2016; Pandey and Vijayakumar 2018). Briefly, the typical signaling cascade consists of a heterotrimeric G protein complex that contains G\u03b1, G\u03b2, and G\u03b3 subunits, which exists in an inactive state associated with a GPCR (G protein coupled receptor) that is localized to the cell membrane. In this inactive state, GDP is bound to the G\u03b1 subunit. Upon interaction of the GPCR with an extracellular ligand, GDP is exchanged for GTP on the G\u03b1 subunit. This results in the dissociation of the heterotrimer from the GPCR and the further dissociation of G\u03b1 from G\u03b2G\u03b3. In their dissociated forms, both G\u03b1 and G\u03b2G\u03b3, are able to regulate downstream effectors. Eventually, a GTPase activity carried on the G\u03b1 subunit converts the bound GTP to GDP and restores G\u03b1 to its inactive form, which also enables rebinding and inactivation of G\u03b2G\u03b3. RGS proteins interact with the G\u03b1 subunit and accelerate its native GTPase activity, thus reducing the time that G protein signaling would be active. Both the N. crassa and A. nidulans FLBA proteins contain an RGS domain as well as two DEP (disheveled, EGL-10, pleckstrin) domains (Figure S3) (Wang et al. 2013). The RGS domain is required for interaction with G\u03b1 proteins (Ross and Wilkie 2000; Siderovski and Willard 2005; Soundararajan et al. 2008; Kosloff et al. 2011). DEP domains have been shown to promote association of proteins with the cell membrane, but may also promote association with specific GPCRs so that a given RGS protein might be localized to sites that contain its substrate G\u03b1 protein (Ballon et al. 2006; Chen and Hamm 2006; Consonni et al. 2014).", "The second change common to the four high expressing strains and absent in all the low expressing strains occurred in the gene encoding the NCU08319 protein, which is an ortholog of the A. nidulans FlbA protein (Figure S3).

Eventually, a GTPase activity carried on the G\u03b1 subunit converts the bound GTP to GDP and restores G\u03b1 to its inactive form, which also enables rebinding and inactivation of G\u03b2G\u03b3. RGS proteins interact with the G\u03b1 subunit and accelerate its native GTPase activity, thus reducing the time that G protein signaling would be active. Both the N. crassa and A. nidulans FLBA proteins contain an RGS domain as well as two DEP (disheveled, EGL-10, pleckstrin) domains (Figure S3) (Wang et al. 2013). The RGS domain is required for interaction with G\u03b1 proteins (Ross and Wilkie 2000; Siderovski and Willard 2005; Soundararajan et al. 2008; Kosloff et al. 2011). DEP domains have been shown to promote association of proteins with the cell membrane, but may also promote association with specific GPCRs so that a given RGS protein might be localized to sites that contain its substrate G\u03b1 protein (Ballon et al. 2006; Chen and Hamm 2006; Consonni et al. 2014).", "The change in common to the four overexpressing strains in the flbA gene was a single C-G base pair deletion in exon 2 (codon 320) or exon 3 (codon 336), depending on the splice variant of the gene (Figure 3B). None of the strains expressing low levels of aod-1 transcript contained the mutation. The deletion would result in a frameshift in the coding sequence leading to the creation of a stop codon and truncation of the encoded protein from 766 amino acids to 375 amino acids for splice variant 1, or 750 amino acids to 359 amino acids for variant 2. This mutation would have a drastic effect on the function of the protein given that both the RGS and DEP domains would be lost (Figure S3). Since the normal function of RGS proteins is to accelerate the GTPase activity found in the G\u03b1 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, inactivation of the RGS protein would result in prolonged activity of the active GTP bound form of G\u03b1.", "The change in common to the four overexpressing strains in the flbA gene was a single C-G base pair deletion in exon 2 (codon 320) or exon 3 (codon 336), depending on the splice variant of the gene (Figure 3B).

Thus, it would be predicted that loss of the G\u03b1 protein controlled by the FLBA protein should lead to a reduction of aod-1 expression. In A. nidulans, the FlbA protein interacts with the G\u03b1 protein FadA (Yu et al. 1996; Yu et al. 1999). The Neurospora ortholog of FadA is a class I fungal G\u03b1 protein called GNA1 (NCU06493) that is most closely related to the G\u03b1i family in mammals (Turner and Borkovich 1993; Ivey et al. 1996; B\u00f6lker 1998; Li et al. 2007).
