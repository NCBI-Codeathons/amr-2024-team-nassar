See DOI: 10.1039/d1sc02725e", "These authors contributed equally.", "The development of new antibiotics is imperative to fight increasing mortality rates connected to infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. In this context, Gram-negative pathogens listed in the WHO priority list are particularly problematic. Darobactin is a ribosomally produced and post-translationally modified bicyclic heptapeptide antibiotic selectively killing Gram-negative bacteria by targeting the outer membrane protein BamA. The native darobactin A producer Photorhabdus khanii HGB1456 shows very limited production under laboratory cultivation conditions. Herein, we present the design and heterologous expression of a synthetically engineered darobactin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in Escherichia coli to reach an average darobactin A production titre of 13.4 mg L\u22121. Rational design of darA variants, encoding the darobactin precursor peptide with altered core sequences, resulted in the production of 13 new \u2018non-natural\u2019 darobactin derivatives and 4 previously hypothetical natural darobactins. One of the non-natural compounds, darobactin 9, was more potent than darobactin A, and showed significantly improved activity especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.125 \u03bcg mL\u22121) and Acinetobacter baumannii (1\u20132 \u03bcg mL\u22121). Importantly, it also displayed superior activity against MDR clinical isolates of E. coli (1\u20132 \u03bcg mL\u22121) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1\u20134 \u03bcg mL\u22121). Independent deletions of genes from the darobactin BGC showed that only darA and darE, encoding a radical forming S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent enzyme, are required for darobactin formation. Co-expression of two additional genes associated with the BGCs in hypothetical producer strains identified a proteolytic detoxification mechanism as a potential self-resistance strategy in native producers. Taken together, we describe a versatile heterologous darobactin platform allowing the production of unprecedented active derivatives in good yields, and we provide first experimental evidence for darobactin biosynthesis processes.", "Heterologous expression of a synthetically engineered darobactin gene cluster in E. coli yields new darobactin derivatives with improved anti-Gram-negative activity.

Murepavidin is currently in preclinical development as precision antibiotic against P. aeruginosa to treat patients with cystic fibrosis.10 Another example is the benzamide compound TXA709, which is active against Staphylococcus aureus by affecting septum formation during cell division through the inhibition of FtsZ, a protein without homolog in eukaryotic cells.11 Moreover, the streptomyces-derived griselimycins are highly active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis by inhibiting the new antimicrobial target DnaN, the DNA polymerase sliding clamp.12 Other examples are the spiropyrimidintrione zoliflodacin and the linear polyaromatic peptide cystobactamid, which show broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, e.g. against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and MDR Escherichia coli, respectively, by inhibiting DNA gyrase at distinct binding sites compared to other gyrase-targeting antibiotics like the quinolones.13 However, the number of promising antibiotic lead structures with activity against Gram-negative pathogens currently in clinical development is limited. One key reason why it is so difficult to find novel antibiotics active against Gram-negative bacteria is their OM, which constitutes a major additional permeation barrier for most of the candidate compounds under development.

The antimicrobial activity of each darobactin derivative-containing crude extract against K. pneumoniae DSM-30104, P. aeruginosa PAO1, E. coli ATCC25922 and A. baumannii DSM-30008 is given as concentration factor (100\u00d7 concentration caused by the extraction process) divided by the lowest dilution factor (1\u2009:\u200915\u20131\u2009:\u2009240 dilutions applied in the MIC assay) where growth inhibition was last observed. The lower the crude extract concentration factor at which growth inhibition of a certain pathogen was last observed, the stronger the antimicrobial activity. Weak activity is highlighted in light green colors (e.g. growth inhibition at 6.67\u00d7 and 3.34\u00d7 concentration of the crude extract) and strong activity is highlighted in green to dark-green colors (e.g. 1.67\u00d7\u20130.42\u00d7 concentration), whereas \u201c-\u201d means no activity even at 6.67\u00d7 concentration.

We indeed observed degradation of darobactins A and 9 after 12 h of incubation with DarF, whereas no degradation was seen in the control experiments without DarF (see ESI Fig. 49 and 50\u2020). These observations supported that DarF is a darobactin-degrading enzyme. A possible function of DarF in P. luteoviolacea S4054 might be a feedback-regulated self-detoxification or self-resistance mechanism, in which high darobactin A concentrations lead to darF gene expression and consequently the degradation of darobactin A, thereby setting a limit to darobactin concentrations not harmful for the native producer. In our heterologous expression system, however, the potential feedback-regulated gene expression might be impaired, because darF is constitutively overexpressed under the regulation of the nptII promoter, which seems to lead to complete degradation of darobactin.", "In summary, darA and darE are the only genes essential for darobactin production in E. coli BL21 (DE3), which was also shown in parallel work by Wuisan et al.20 Co-expression of darBCD increases the production level of darobactin A by a factor of 2\u20134, whereas darG co-expression reduces the production level, as judged by comparison of the darobactin A mass peak. Since co-expression of darF led to complete abolishment of darobactin production and no homologs were identified in the genomes of P. khanii HGB1456 and E. coli BL21 (DE3), we rule out that DarF is the protease involved in the proteolytic maturation process of the compound, in which the leader peptide or tail sequence are removed. Both the mechanism of action of DarF and the proteolytic maturation mechanism of darobactin, performed by a so far unidentified protease enzyme in the native producer strain and a similar enzyme in E. coli BL21 (DE3) have to be investigated in future experiments.", "In summary, darA and darE are the only genes essential for darobactin production in E. coli BL21 (DE3), which was also shown in parallel work by Wuisan et al.20 Co-expression of darBCD increases the production level of darobactin A by a factor of 2\u20134, whereas darG co-expression reduces the production level, as judged by comparison of the darobactin A mass peak.

Excluding the previously published darobactin A,15 17 new darobactin derivatives were produced after expression of darA variants encoding different core peptide sequences. Every position in the molecule was shown to be reasonably flexible for structure engineering by incorporation of different amino acids, except of the two l-tryptophans in positions 1 and 3, which are required for formation of the bicyclic darobactin core structure, proving the versatility of the presented system. Likewise, high substrate tolerance has been observed for biosynthetic enzymes in other RiPP pathways, e.g. in lanthipeptide, thiopeptide, lasso peptide and sactipeptide biosynthesis,32 underlining the potential of RiPP structure engineering to generate new antibiotics.", "In this work, we developed a versatile heterologous production platform for darobactin derivatives based on a darobactin BGC from P. khanii HGB1456 modified for the expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3).

For the other darobactin derivatives, we relied on appearance of the corresponding mass peak after heterologous expression of the respective plasmid-based BGC, followed by comparison of the calculated to the measured exact mass and corresponding MS2 fragmentation pattern to assign the predicted structures for the remaining derivatives not isolated so far. However, for the l-cysteine-containing derivatives we observed an unexpected mass shift of +191.02 Da that we were not able to account for, while the MS2 spectrum indicates the molecule contains the darobactin core structure including the l-cysteine. It therefore seems likely that the sulphur nucleophile in the respective darobactin derivatives has reacted with a metabolite in the cell in order to detoxify the sulphur nucleophile.
