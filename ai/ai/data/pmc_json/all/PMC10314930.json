["Antibiotic resistance ABC-Fs (ARE ABC-Fs) are translation factors that provide resistance against clinically important ribosome-targeting antibiotics which are proliferating among pathogens. Here, we combine genetic and structural approaches to determine the regulation of streptococcal ARE ABC-F gene msrD in response to macrolide exposure. We show that binding of cladinose-containing macrolides to the ribosome prompts insertion of the leader peptide MsrDL into a crevice of the ribosomal exit tunnel, which is conserved throughout bacteria and eukaryotes. This leads to a local rearrangement of the 23\u2009S rRNA that prevents peptide bond formation and accommodation of release factors. The stalled ribosome obstructs the formation of a Rho-independent terminator structure that prevents msrD transcriptional attenuation. Erythromycin induction of msrD expression via MsrDL, is suppressed by ectopic expression of mrsD, but not by mutants which do not provide antibiotic resistance, showing correlation between MsrD function in antibiotic resistance and its action on this stalled complex.", "Antibiotic resistance ABC-F factors protect the ribosome from important antibiotics.

ABC-F proteins are composed of two ABC domains joined by a linker domain called P-site tRNA-interaction motif (PtIM)8,9, also termed antibiotic resistance determinant (ARD) for ARE ABC-Fs1\u20133.

However, the unusual position of base U2584 seems to be a unique feature of MsrDL-SRC.", "Our biochemical investigations showed that the MsrDL-SRC was formed due to hampered translation termination on the UAA stop codon. This stop codon is recognized by both RF1 and RF2, which subsequently catalyze peptide hydrolysis via their conserved GGQ motif protruding within the PTC. Structural alignment of our atomic model to RF1- and RF2-containing ribosome structures64 revealed that proper accommodation of the RFs is prevented by steric clashes of the methylated glutamine and the glycines of the GGQ motif against the residue F5 of MsrDL and 23\u2009S rRNA bases U2584 and U2585, respectively (Fig.\u00a04e). The conformation of MsrDL peptide stabilized the PTC in an uninduced conformation65 which prevents the opening of the active site necessary for peptide bond formation and hydrolysis (Fig.\u00a04f).

The residue L3 being ~3.8\u2009\u00c5 away from cladinose sugar and the residue I4 being ~3.9\u2009\u00c5 away from desosamine sugar, consistent with a hydrophobic interaction between MsrDL and the drug (Fig.\u00a04g\u2013i).

The gene msrD forms an operon with the efflux pump mefA (Fig.\u00a01a), which is also regulated via ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation, translational stalling occurring on the mefAL33. Therefore, msrD is under the dual-regulation of two ERY-sensing leader peptides. One explanation for this redundancy may reside in the need for the bacteria to tightly regulate msrD because of its toxicity. The expression of msrDWT in E. coli DB10 led to a 20% growth defect compared to control condition (Fig.\u00a01c), suggesting that msrDWT expression has a fitness cost for the bacteria and can be beneficial only in the presence of antibiotic.
