It was observed that PD-L1 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells, and also partially expressed in stromal cells (Fig.\u00a01A). Among 98 patients with CC (Table\u00a01), 51 patients (52.04%) showed positive expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, which was related to the patient's fertility history (p\u2009=\u20090.0042), abortion history (p\u2009=\u20090.0167), differentiation grade (p\u2009=\u20090.0381) and FIGO stage (p\u2009=\u20090.0440). PD-L1 was positively expressed in stromal cells in 45 patients (45.92%), which was related to fertility history (p\u2009=\u20090.0014), abortion history (p\u2009=\u20090.0100), tumor size (p\u2009=\u20090.0167) and FIGO stage (p\u2009=\u20090.0000).

Meanwhile, the infiltration of CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages in CC tissue was positively correlated with the expression of PD-L1 (Fig.\u00a02).

D PD-L1 in stromal cells and CD163+ macrophages", "Figure\u00a01 shows the IHC staining images of PD-L1, CD68, and CD163. And IHC staining of PD-L1, CD68 and CD163 were performed in 98 patient tissues. The positive expression staining is brown. It was observed that PD-L1 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells, and also partially expressed in stromal cells (Fig.\u00a01A). Among 98 patients with CC (Table\u00a01), 51 patients (52.04%) showed positive expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, which was related to the patient's fertility history (p\u2009=\u20090.0042), abortion history (p\u2009=\u20090.0167), differentiation grade (p\u2009=\u20090.0381) and FIGO stage (p\u2009=\u20090.0440). PD-L1 was positively expressed in stromal cells in 45 patients (45.92%), which was related to fertility history (p\u2009=\u20090.0014), abortion history (p\u2009=\u20090.0100), tumor size (p\u2009=\u20090.0167) and FIGO stage (p\u2009=\u20090.0000). Moreover, the positive expression of CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages was mainly in the cell membrane, and the median distribution of intratumoral density in 98 CC samples was 14.0 and 12.0, respectively (Fig.\u00a01B, C). Meanwhile, the infiltration of CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages in CC tissue was positively correlated with the expression of PD-L1 (Fig.\u00a02). There was a weak correlation between the PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and the infiltration of CD68+ macrophages (r\u2009=\u20090.2957, p\u2009=\u20090.0031, Fig.\u00a02A), and a strong correlation between PD-L1 expression on interstitial cells and the infiltration of CD68+ macrophages (r\u2009=\u20090.8369, p\u2009<\u20090.0001, Fig.\u00a02B). PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was strongly correlated with the infiltration of CD163+ macrophages (r\u2009=\u20090.8582, p\u2009<\u20090.0001, Fig.\u00a02C), and PD-L1 expression on interstitial cells was moderately related to the infiltration of CD163+ macrophages (r\u2009=\u20090.4232, p\u2009<\u20090.0001, Fig.\u00a02D). These results indicated that the correlation between CD163 density and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was stronger than that of CD68 density. And the correlation between CD163+ macrophages infiltration and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was higher than that of stromal cells.Fig.\u00a01Immunohistochemistry staining for PD-L1, CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages in patients with cervical cancer.

And 34.4\u201368.0% of PD-L1 positive expression was detected in tissues of CC patients [24, 25]. In our study, 52% of patients with CC showed positive expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, and 45.9% of CC patients showed PD-L1-positive expression on stromal cells. Hence, it provided a potential therapeutic target for the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors because of the widespread expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues. The expression range of PD-L1 was relatively wide due to the differences in patients' clinical characteristics, antibody sources, detection platforms, and evaluation criteria, so we believed that there was valid for the positive rate of PD-L1 in this study. Meanwhile, the expression of PD-L1 in CC tissues was related to fertility history, abortion history, differentiation grade, tumor size and FIGO stage in our study. Previous studies have shown that PD-1/PD-L1 pathway was closely associated with the history of fertility and abortion [26]. Pregnancy changed the immune status of the body, especially the uterine microenvironment including the cervix, while activating PD-1/PD-L1 pathways to induce and maintain immune tolerance. Moreover, PD-L1 expression tends to be higher in patients with advanced stage [27, 28], large tumor size [29], and poorly differentiated tumors. In summary, these results indicated that the variable efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy may be due to individual differences and different degrees of disease development.", "The expression of PD-L1 was gradually upregulated in normal cervix, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and CC tissues. And 34.4\u201368.0% of PD-L1 positive expression was detected in tissues of CC patients [24, 25]. In our study, 52% of patients with CC showed positive expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, and 45.9% of CC patients showed PD-L1-positive expression on stromal cells. Hence, it provided a potential therapeutic target for the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors because of the widespread expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues. The expression range of PD-L1 was relatively wide due to the differences in patients' clinical characteristics, antibody sources, detection platforms, and evaluation criteria, so we believed that there was valid for the positive rate of PD-L1 in this study. Meanwhile, the expression of PD-L1 in CC tissues was related to fertility history, abortion history, differentiation grade, tumor size and FIGO stage in our study. Previous studies have shown that PD-1/PD-L1 pathway was closely associated with the history of fertility and abortion [26]. Pregnancy changed the immune status of the body, especially the uterine microenvironment including the cervix, while activating PD-1/PD-L1 pathways to induce and maintain immune tolerance. Moreover, PD-L1 expression tends to be higher in patients with advanced stage [27, 28], large tumor size [29], and poorly differentiated tumors.

Previous studies have also shown that high expression of PD-L1 was associated with poor prognosis in various malignant tumors [30, 31]. In CC, the high expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues was similarly related to poor prognosis [19, 32]. In our study, the positive expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells in CC tissue indicated a poor prognosis, while PD-L1 expression on stromal cells was not directly related to the prognosis of patients, suggesting that the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells in CC TME was a reliable prognostic predictor.", "PD-L1 expressed on the surface of tumor cells can lead to T cell apoptosis and invalidation through specifically binding to PD-1 on the surface of tumor-infiltrating T cells, which is an important factor for tumor progression and poor prognosis.

TAMs, as one of the most important immune cells in TME, were generally believed to play a key role in regulating the immunosuppression of PD-1/PD-L1 [35, 36]. First of all, macrophages can phagocytose PD\u20111 antibody. Arlauckas et al. observed that PD-1 antibodies could quickly and effectively bind PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells after administration. However, PD-1\u2212 macrophages can capture PD-1 antibodies from the PD-1+CD8+T cell surface within minutes, limiting the reactivation of exhausted T cells and rendering them incapable of antitumor effects [37]. Furthermore, macrophages inhibited T cells reactivated by PD\u20111 antibody to migrate to tumor islets. T cells must possess some abilities to eradicate tumor cells. On the one hand, they should efficiently accumulate and migrate to interact with tumor cells, on the other hand, T cells must respond adequately to tumor antigens and other activation signals [38]. Currently, immunotherapies mainly focus on restoring the dysfunction of T cells [39, 40], but lack of studies on promoting T cells to migrate to tumor nests. CD8+ T cells poorly migrated and infiltrated into tumor islets resulted from long-lasting interaction with macrophages [38]. Therefore, macrophages depletion may reactivate CD8+T cells to migrate and invade tumor islets, and improve the therapeutic effect of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Thirdly, TAMs are capable of secreting cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and CCL18, which mediate tumor-promoting activity and immunosuppression in the TME. Cytokines secreted by TAMs including TGF-\u03b2 have been found to affect PD-L1 expression [41]. In breast cancer and melanoma, TGF-\u03b2 can induce the upregulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells and tumor-associated angiogenesis [16, 42]. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 derived from TAMs inhibited T cell activity through phosphorylating Smad2/3 protein and inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, thus promoting the formation of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment [43, 44]. In addition, PGE2 upregulated PD-L1 expression in ovarian cancer cells via activating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway to influence tumor growth [17], while reducing the infiltration of CD8+T cells [18]. Similarly, Wang et al.'s analysis showed that the upregulation of CCL18 secreted by M2-type macrophages can activate the PI3K-AKT pathway, thereby affecting tumor proliferation [45]. Therefore, the role of TAMs in the formation of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment cannot be ignored. In short, macrophages play an important role in the treatment of PD-1/PD-L1.

As an important group of inflammatory cells in the TME, macrophages are well known for their plasticity and heterogeneity [47]. According to the different stimulating factors and secreted products, macrophages subpopulations are traditionally classified into classic activated macrophages (M1) and alternative activated macrophages (M2) [46]. However, on account of macrophages can express overlapping M1 and M2 genes, this nomenclature is too simple to label macrophages with M1 or M2 [48]. Macrophages perform pro-inflammatory and tumor suppressive functions under the exposure of pro-inflammatory stimuli including IFN-\u03b3 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Specifically, macrophages can contribute to antitumor immunity by releasing IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, IL-23, TNF-\u03b1 and reactive nitrogen [13]. While in the TME, macrophages are induced to present the alternatively activated characteristics. High levels of IL-10 and the expression of mannose and galactose receptors which are secreted by macrophages are induced by anti-inflammatory stimuli including IL-4, IL-13 and immune complexes [49]. Such macrophages express high levels of Arg-1, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-10, which play an anti-inflammatory role and promote tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis and intravasation [13]. Under different signal stimulation, M1-type TAMs and M2-type TAMs play a dynamic change [50]. Therefore, the origin, the stimuli and the phenotype should be together to define macrophages [4]. In the study of Lai and Lv et al., LPS and IFN-\u03b3 were added to obtain M1-type TAMs, and M2-type TAMs were obtained by adding IL-4 and lL-13 [51, 52].

CD68 is a marker for pan-macrophages. CD163 is considered as a specific molecular marker for M2-type TAMs. In the study of Deng et al., the density of CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages in PD-L1-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in PD-L1-negative tissues [60]. Similarly, in the study of Harada et al., the intratumoral infiltration of CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages were significantly higher in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues with PD-L1-positive than in those PD-L1-negative [61]. In the study of Guo et al., it was reached a consistent conclusion in CC tissues. In this study, PD-L1 expression was positively correlated with the infiltration of CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages by performing IHC staining of 98 patients.

And the correlation between M1-type macrophages and PD-L1 seems to be stronger than M2 macrophages in the TCGA-CESC data. Unfortunately, this is in conflict with the results of in vitro cell experiments, where M2-type macrophages have a more significant impact on tumor cells. There are several factors. Firstly, M1/M2-type macrophages were represented by characteristic molecules rather than actual macrophages in GSVA analyses. Therefore, there is a direct impact on the results for the selection of characteristic molecules.

In conclusion, studying the regulatory mechanism of TAMs on PD-L1 expression in CC cells provided a theoretical basis for improving patient efficacy and combined therapy.", "Abbreviations", "Cervical cancer", "Tumor microenvironment", "Programmed cell death ligand 1", "Programmed cell death factor 1", "Immune checkpoint inhibitors", "Objective response rate", "Interleukin", "Colony-stimulating factor 1", "Arginnse-1", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/protein kinase B", "Immunohistochemistry", "Quantitative real-time PCR", "Gene setvariation analysis", "Interferon-r", "Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1", "Transforming growing factor \u03b2", "Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor", "Lipopolysaccharide", "Publisher's Note", "Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "Fan Guo, Weina Kong and Dewei Li contributed equally to this work.", "Acknowledgements", "Thanks to Xinjiang Medical University for providing the experimental platform and helping the authors with the manuscript.
