The resulting posttranslationally modified lanthipeptides (RosA1 and RosA2) obtained from heterologous expression within E. coli were subsequently converted into bioactive roseocin via in vitro cleavage using commercial proteases (Singh, Chaudhary and Sareen 2020).", "CONCLUSION", "CONCLUSION", "The recent great technological advances in the area of synthetic biology of actinomycetes present a great promise for a revolutionary transformation of the biotechnological production of powerful new drugs. They can facilitate the biochemical characterization of new compounds, help enhance their production to economically viable levels, support the chemical diversification of initial chemical scaffolds, and accelerate the transfer of new compounds to industrial production. The examples discussed illustrate the range of the techniques and concepts that contribute to this technological revolution, but they also highlight the numerous areas that still require further research before the full potential of synthetic biology can be realized. Actinomycetes, with their immense chemical diversity and their unique challenges and opportunities for biosynthetic engineering, will remain at the forefront of these developments.", "The recent great technological advances in the area of synthetic biology of actinomycetes present a great promise for a revolutionary transformation of the biotechnological production of powerful new drugs.
