["These authors contributed equally to this work.", "Bacteria, filamentous fungi, and plants synthesize thousands of secondary metabolites with important biological and pharmacological activities. The biosynthesis of these metabolites is performed by networks of complex enzymes such as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, polyketide synthases, and terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes. The efficient production of these metabolites is dependent upon the supply of precursors that arise from primary metabolism. In the last decades, an impressive array of biosynthetic enzymes that provide specific precursors and intermediates leading to secondary metabolites biosynthesis has been reported. Suitable knowledge of the elaborated pathways that synthesize these precursors or intermediates is essential for advancing chemical biology and the production of natural or semisynthetic biological products. Two of the more prolific routes that provide key precursors in the biosynthesis of antitumor, immunosuppressant, antifungal, or antibacterial compounds are the lysine and ornithine pathways, which are involved in the biosynthesis of \u03b2-lactams and other non-ribosomal peptides, and bacterial and fungal siderophores. Detailed analysis of the molecular genetics and biochemistry of the enzyme system shows that they are formed by closely related components. Particularly the focus of this study is on molecular genetics and the enzymatic steps that lead to the formation of intermediates of the lysine pathway, such as \u03b1-aminoadipic acid, saccharopine, pipecolic acid, and related compounds, and of ornithine-derived molecules, such as N5-Acetyl-N5-Hydroxyornithine and N5-anhydromevalonyl-N5-hydroxyornithine, which are precursors of siderophores. We provide evidence that shows interesting functional relationships between the genes encoding the enzymes that synthesize these products.

Summary and Future Outlook", "8. Summary and Future Outlook", "In the last decades, great advances have been made in the characterization of the genomes and proteomes of microorganisms [145,146]. This has provided new information on the metabolic complexity of networks that provide precursors for the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites. We have discussed in this article the present knowledge on the biosynthetic pathways that convert amino acids, such as lysine and ornithine, into a wealth of metabolites that have important applications in medicine and the pharmaceutical industry, including antibacterial compounds, antifungals, immunosuppressants, antitumoral, neuroprotectives, and siderophore molecules. Remarkably, lysine is synthesized in different organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and plants, by three distinct pathways, and this provides a large number of intermediates. An interesting network includes the biosynthesis of the \u03b1-AAA, \u03b1-aminoadipate semialdehyde, saccharopine, and some pathway derivatives such as pipecolic acid; there is a clear interconversion of precursors and intermediates that supply molecules for the biosynthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and many pipecolic-derived bacterial and plant metabolites. In P. chrysogenum/P. rubens, which serve as model microorganisms for the biosynthesis of \u03b2-lactams there are up to five genes coding for proteins similar to saccharopine reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase that are likely to increase the supply of key precursors for this class of antibiotics; the presence of several copies of these genes, two of which are located inside or close to the penicillin gene cluster, indicates that evolutionary gene duplication and adaptation occurred in nature that may influence the survival of penicillin producing strains in competition with bacteria in the soil. Enzymes involved in the formation of \u03b1-aminoadipate semialdehyde and \u03b1-AAA have been developed both in \u03b2-lactam producer filamentous fungi and in actinobacteria. Noteworthy, the lysine aminotransferase in actinobacteria is encoded by a gene of the cephamycin gene cluster, co-regulated with other genes of the cluster, suggesting that there is a convergent adaptation of enzymes in different groups of microorganisms to provide the above-mentioned precursors. Another important group of precursors derived from the lysine or ornithine pathways is essential for the production of bacterial and fungal siderophores. This article provides evidence indicating that there are important contributions to the formation of lysine derivatives, such as cadaverine, or ornithine derivates, such as N5-hydroxyornithine or N5-succinyl-N5-hydroxyornithine, for the biosynthesis of different types of bacterial siderophores, such as desferrioxamines and coelichelin. In addition, some fungal siderophores, such as fusarinins, ferrichromes, and coprogens, derive from ornithine. In this review, we have integrated all enzymatic studies with the characterization of the genes that encode those enzymes. Heterologous expression of genes encoding the biosynthetic precursors is a very interesting possibility to improve the production of bioactive compounds. So far, expression of core genes of the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic has been performed in other fungi and yeasts [147,148], but there are problems derived from the proper cellular localization of the cloned biosynthetic enzymes and the intracellular transport of intermediates through organelles [136].
