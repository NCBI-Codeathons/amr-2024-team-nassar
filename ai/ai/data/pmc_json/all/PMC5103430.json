As a result, a core set of enzymatic activities has been found to synthesize the diverse sugar structures observed in nature. Various common enzyme reactions, which include deoxygenations, transaminations, ketoreductions, C-, N- or O-methylations, epimerizations, and less frequently oxygenations, are required to generate the surprisingly high structural diversity of natural DOHs [3, 9]. The complete enzyme set required for DOH biosynthesis is, in most cases, encoded in the biosynthesis gene cluster of the respective NP. Therefore, because the great majority of sugars present in bioactive NPs are DOHs, identification of clusters containing genes coding for these activities may constitute a useful strategy for the discovery of clinical attractive drugs [10, 11]. Some of these enzymes have been thoroughly characterized in vitro [12\u201314] and in vivo [15] in multiple attempts to modify sugar structures and alter the glycosylation pattern of NP. Upon DOHs biosynthesis, transfer onto specific positions of the corresponding aglycone is controlled by glycosyltransferase (GT) enzymes. These enzymes require an activated DOH donor, typically a NDP or NMP-DOH, for transfer of the glycosyl residue to the acceptor molecule [16]. In this way, a staggering diversity of sugars can be transferred to a no less structurally diverse array of acceptor molecules, including polyketide, nonribosomal peptide, indolocarbazole and aminocoumarin aglyca among many others, by the various hundreds of putative GTs described in databases as involved in NPs biosynthesis [16] (http://www.cazy.org/GlycosylTransferases.html). Most GTs catalyze O-glycosidic bond formation between the sugar and its natural aglycone. Other linkages such as C\u2013C [17] or C\u2013N [18] glycosidic bonds are relatively unusual. Substrate flexibility is an interesting feature of some sugar biosynthesis and GT enzymes. This is especially remarkable in GTs which can show different degrees of promiscuity towards the acceptor and/or the donor molecules [3, 8, 19, 20]. Similarly, other GTs possesses the unusual ability to transfer sugars to different positions of the same aglycone sometimes using different type of linkages [21, 22]. GT flexibility is a key aspect for the success of many glycosylation pattern engineering strategies aimed to afford and develop new NPs. Deletion and heterologous expression of DOH biosynthesis and/or GTs genes have allowed the generation of a handful of interesting derivatives from structurally diverse NPs, such as erythromycin [23], methymicin/pikromycin [24], daunorubicin/doxorubicin [25], rebeccamycin [26] or elloramycin [27\u201329], among others.

To detect the biosynthesis of PM100117/18 derivatives, whole-culture extracts from these strains were analyzed by UPLC (Fig.\u00a03) and HPLC/MS. UPLC chromatograms from strains \u0394gonCM, \u0394gonD3 and \u0394gonE showed suppression of PM100117 (1, UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.182\u00a0min, m/z 1601.9 [M\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+) and PM100118 (2, UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.536\u00a0min, m/z 1585.9 [M\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+) biosynthesis, and the appearance of several peaks corresponding to potential analogues (Fig.\u00a03a). Mass assessments by HPLC/MS suggested that the novel compounds detected in \u0394gonCM are compatible with PM100117/18 analogues in which the first sugar moiety, l-axenose, has been substituted for either 2-deoxy-l-fucose or l-rhodinose. This was confirmed by elucidating the chemical structure of products 3 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.035\u00a0min, m/z 1571.9 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] and 4 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.102\u00a0min, m/z 1555.9 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] by NMR, showing that both are PM100118 derivatives with an l-rhodinose unit in place of l-axenose as first sugar moiety (Fig.\u00a03b and Additional file 2: Fig. S1 and Table S1). The presence of a hydroxyl group at C18 of the polyketide ring in 3 (absent in 4 and also in 1 and 2) suggests that compound 3 might be a shunt product of PM100117/18 biosynthesis after undergoing a hydroxylation reaction at this position. These results are consistent with the involvement of GonCM in l-axenose biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a02). Likewise, compound 5 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a04.941\u00a0min, m/z 1487.8 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+], produced by strain \u0394gonD3 (Fig.\u00a03a), was also purified and subjected to NMR analysis (Additional file 2: Fig. S1 and Table S2), confirming that, as expected from the hypothetical 2,6DOH biosynthetic pathways outlined in Fig.\u00a02, this product structurally derives from PM100117 by lacking the third sugar moiety, l-rhodinose. The estimated molecular mass for compounds 6 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.721\u00a0min, m/z 297 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] and 7 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.796\u00a0min, m/z 239 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] from strain \u0394gonE was strikingly low in comparison to that of the parental products, suggesting that these compounds might not be related to PM100117/18 biosynthesis. However, structure elucidation (Additional file 2: Fig. S1 and Table S3) revealed that 6 corresponds to the naphthoquinone chromophore, while 7 is the precursor of 6 to which a propionate side chain is incorporated (Fig.\u00a03b). Masses displayed by compounds 8 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.012\u00a0min, m/z 1457.8 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] and 9 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.098\u00a0min, m/z 1441.8 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+], fitted with PM100117 lacking both l-rhodinose as third sugar moiety and oxygenations at C16 and/or C17. Nonetheless, neither these structural features nor the configuration of the sugar moieties presumably present in 8 and 9 have been further confirmed because the low production level and high instability of these products, which made impossible the purification of quantities suitable for NMR analysis. On the other hand, mutant \u0394gonR1 produced PM100117/18 at similar levels to those observed in wild type S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A (Fig.\u00a03a), indicating that this gene is not essential for PM100117/18 2,6DOHs biosynthesis. It is important to note the presence in the PM100117/18 gene cluster of an additional putative NDP-4-keto-6-deoxyhexose reductase gene, gonR2 (Fig.\u00a01b). We set to determine whether this gene codes for the 4-ketoreductase activity presumably involved in the final biosynthesis step of the three PM100117/18 2,6DOHs (Fig.\u00a02). Nevertheless, after recurrent attempts, we fail to produce a gonR2 deletion mutant. As an alternative approach, gonR2 was cloned under the control of the ermE*p promoter to produce pCgonR2, which was introduced in S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A. The metabolic profile of the resultant strain, OEgonR2, was then analyzed by UPLC, showing no differences with respect to wild type strain, GUA-pSETH, carrying the respective empty plasmid (Additional file 3: Fig. S2).Fig.\u00a03Production of PM100117 (1) and PM100118 (2) derivatives 3\u20139 in 2,6-DOH biosynthesis gene mutant strains. a UPLC analysis (254\u00a0nm) of metabolite production in S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A wild-type and \u0394gonCM, \u0394gonD3, \u0394gonE and \u0394gonR1 deletion mutants.

UPLC chromatograms from strains \u0394gonCM, \u0394gonD3 and \u0394gonE showed suppression of PM100117 (1, UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.182\u00a0min, m/z 1601.9 [M\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+) and PM100118 (2, UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.536\u00a0min, m/z 1585.9 [M\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+) biosynthesis, and the appearance of several peaks corresponding to potential analogues (Fig.\u00a03a). Mass assessments by HPLC/MS suggested that the novel compounds detected in \u0394gonCM are compatible with PM100117/18 analogues in which the first sugar moiety, l-axenose, has been substituted for either 2-deoxy-l-fucose or l-rhodinose. This was confirmed by elucidating the chemical structure of products 3 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.035\u00a0min, m/z 1571.9 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] and 4 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.102\u00a0min, m/z 1555.9 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] by NMR, showing that both are PM100118 derivatives with an l-rhodinose unit in place of l-axenose as first sugar moiety (Fig.\u00a03b and Additional file 2: Fig. S1 and Table S1). The presence of a hydroxyl group at C18 of the polyketide ring in 3 (absent in 4 and also in 1 and 2) suggests that compound 3 might be a shunt product of PM100117/18 biosynthesis after undergoing a hydroxylation reaction at this position. These results are consistent with the involvement of GonCM in l-axenose biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a02). Likewise, compound 5 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a04.941\u00a0min, m/z 1487.8 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+], produced by strain \u0394gonD3 (Fig.\u00a03a), was also purified and subjected to NMR analysis (Additional file 2: Fig. S1 and Table S2), confirming that, as expected from the hypothetical 2,6DOH biosynthetic pathways outlined in Fig.\u00a02, this product structurally derives from PM100117 by lacking the third sugar moiety, l-rhodinose. The estimated molecular mass for compounds 6 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.721\u00a0min, m/z 297 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] and 7 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a05.796\u00a0min, m/z 239 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] from strain \u0394gonE was strikingly low in comparison to that of the parental products, suggesting that these compounds might not be related to PM100117/18 biosynthesis. However, structure elucidation (Additional file 2: Fig. S1 and Table S3) revealed that 6 corresponds to the naphthoquinone chromophore, while 7 is the precursor of 6 to which a propionate side chain is incorporated (Fig.\u00a03b). Masses displayed by compounds 8 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.012\u00a0min, m/z 1457.8 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+] and 9 [UPLC Rt\u00a0=\u00a06.098\u00a0min, m/z 1441.8 (M\u00a0+\u00a0Na)+], fitted with PM100117 lacking both l-rhodinose as third sugar moiety and oxygenations at C16 and/or C17. Nonetheless, neither these structural features nor the configuration of the sugar moieties presumably present in 8 and 9 have been further confirmed because the low production level and high instability of these products, which made impossible the purification of quantities suitable for NMR analysis. On the other hand, mutant \u0394gonR1 produced PM100117/18 at similar levels to those observed in wild type S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A (Fig.\u00a03a), indicating that this gene is not essential for PM100117/18 2,6DOHs biosynthesis. It is important to note the presence in the PM100117/18 gene cluster of an additional putative NDP-4-keto-6-deoxyhexose reductase gene, gonR2 (Fig.\u00a01b). We set to determine whether this gene codes for the 4-ketoreductase activity presumably involved in the final biosynthesis step of the three PM100117/18 2,6DOHs (Fig.\u00a02). Nevertheless, after recurrent attempts, we fail to produce a gonR2 deletion mutant. As an alternative approach, gonR2 was cloned under the control of the ermE*p promoter to produce pCgonR2, which was introduced in S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A. The metabolic profile of the resultant strain, OEgonR2, was then analyzed by UPLC, showing no differences with respect to wild type strain, GUA-pSETH, carrying the respective empty plasmid (Additional file 3: Fig. S2).Fig.\u00a03Production of PM100117 (1) and PM100118 (2) derivatives 3\u20139 in 2,6-DOH biosynthesis gene mutant strains. a UPLC analysis (254\u00a0nm) of metabolite production in S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A wild-type and \u0394gonCM, \u0394gonD3, \u0394gonE and \u0394gonR1 deletion mutants.

As additional route to produce PM100117/18 structural analogues, we pursued to manipulate 2,6DOH transfer to the PM100117/18 macrolactone aglycone by independently deleting these putative GT genes. Thus, we produced mutant strains \u0394gonG1, \u0394gonG2, \u0394gonG3 and \u0394gonG4. Metabolite production of these strains was examined as described above. It is known that loss of the naphthoquinone chromophore unit causes a shift in the PM100117/18 maximum absorption wavelength from 254 to 216\u00a0nm [32]. Thereby, since deletion of GT genes could lead to glycosylation pattern changes involving loss of this structural element, screening for novel derivatives entailed the analysis of chromatograms at both wavelengths. Deletion of gonG1 or gonG2 abolished PM100117/18 production (Fig.\u00a04a) and induced the accumulation of various potential analogues with a maximum absorption wavelength at 216\u00a0nm, hence lacking the naphthoquinone moiety (Fig.\u00a04b). HPLC/MS analysis showed that novel compounds produced by strain \u0394gonG1 possess masses corresponding to different variations of the PM100117/18 non-glycosylated aglycone, while masses of those produced by mutant strain \u0394gonG2 matched putative PM100117/18 analogues lacking the second 2,6DOH moiety.

Lastly, deletion of gonG4 did not show any effect either on PM100117/18 biosynthesis, which were produced at comparable levels to those observed in the wild type strain S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A, or on the accumulation of novel PM100117/18 derivatives (Fig.\u00a04a, b). The study of the possible role of this gene in PM100117/18 biosynthesis is addressed in section below.Fig.\u00a04Production of PM100117 (1) and PM100118 (2) biosynthesis intermediates 10\u201313 in glycosyltransferase gene mutant strains.

Firstly, a precise quantification of PM100117/18 production in strain \u0394gonG4 and wild type S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A confirmed that gonG4 deletion has no impact on the production level of these compounds, suggesting that putative GT GonG4 might not be involved in their biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a05a). To assess the potential of GonG4 to transfer 2,6DOHs to PM100117/18, we increased its presence in S. caniferus GUA-06-05-006A by over-expressing gonG4 using the integrative plasmid pSGonG4. Precise UPLC-based quantification of PM100117/18 production in the resultant strain, OEgonG4, did not show any change with respect to the wild type strain (Fig.\u00a05b; Additional file 3: Fig. S3a). Next, we reasoned that, under certain conditions, transfer of 2-deoxy-l-fucose and l-rhodinose as second 2,6DOH units to form PM100117 and PM100118, respectively, might involve two different GTs. However no potential derivative containing the second sugar moiety was detected when gonG4 was over-expressed in \u0394gonG2 (Additional file 3: Fig. S3b). On the other hand, a defensive function consisting of transferring of glucose units to antibiotic agents, which as a result become inactivated, has been proposed for several GTs [33\u201335]. Notwithstanding, the involvement of GonG4 in PM100117/18 inactivation by glycosylation has not been proven by experiments consisting of gonG4 over-expression and subsequent feeding with PM100118.

The biosynthesis pathways of the PM100117/18 2,6DOHs moieties (Fig.\u00a02) that can be deduced from these functions are congruent with 2,6DOHs biosynthesis reaction schemes previously reported [36]. Only a gene coding for an EryBII-type 3-ketoreductase (3KR, Fig.\u00a02) presumably involved in the formation of a NDP-4-keto-2,6DOH intermediate with an axial hydroxyl group at C3 has not been located within the gene cluster. The absence of functions required for 2,6DOHs biosynthesis has been also described in the sequence analysis of the gene cluster of other glycosylated NPs, such as spinosyn [37], brasilicardin A [38] or mithramycin [39]. However, in the later example, gene mtmC has been shown to code for a ketoreductase/methyltrasnferase bifunctional enzyme [40, 41]. Thus, 3-C-methyltransferase GonCM might be also responsible for the 3-ketoreduction reaction leading to l-axenose. Alternatively, methylation of the NDP-4-keto-2,6-dideoxyl-d-Glucose intermediate by GonCM could be sequential to GonR3 activity (Fig.\u00a02). Furthermore, the involvement of 3-C-methyltransferase GonCM and 3-dehydratase GonD3 in reaction steps of l-axenose and l-rhodinose biosynthesis, respectively, is also supported by genetic engineering experiments (Fig.\u00a03). Likewise, implication of 3,5-epimerase GonE in PM100117/18 biosynthesis has been also confirmed. Nevertheless, putative isomerase activity of this enzyme has not been further verified because of the impossibility to conduct NMR analysis of compounds 8 and 9. It is noteworthy the presence in the PM100117/18 gene cluster of two genes, gonR1 and gonR2, coding for putative 4-ketoreductase enzymes. However, the involvement of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of the three PM100117/18 DOH moieties has not been fully demonstrated by genetic experiments. The inactivation of gonR1 has no apparent effect on PM100117/18 biosynthesis, and its lack could be complemented by the presence of an additional 4-ketoreductase encoded in S. caniferus chromosome, being gonR2 a good candidate. On the other hand, the impossibility of producing a gonR2 deletion mutant suggests the involvement of this gene in important primary processes such as, for example, supply of essential sugars for cell-wall formation.

Putative GT GonG1 is involved in transfer of the first sugar unit, l-axenose, since upon deletion of gonG1 no glycosylated PM100117/18 derivatives were produced (Fig.\u00a04). Following l-axenose transfer, GonG2 is responsible for the introduction of the second sugar moiety, 2-deoxy-l-fucose and l-rhodinose, to PM100117 and PM100118 biosynthesis, respectively. Since two different 2,6DOH moieties can be transferred as second sugar unit, we previously predicted the involvement in this step of two GTs, each dedicated to transfer only one 2,6DOH. Nevertheless, UPLC and MS analysis did not detect production in \u0394gonG2 strain of PM100117/18 analogues carrying the second DOH unit (Fig.\u00a04), thus pointing at GonG2 as the only GT responsible for the introduction of both 2,6DOHs at second position of the PM100117/18 glycosylation pattern. Finally, the structure of analogues derived from \u0394gonG3 (Fig.\u00a04c), which lack the third sugar moiety, suggests that GonG3 is the GT in charge of transferring l-rhodinose to the naphthoquinone moiety of the PM100117/18 glycosylation profile. Surprisingly, the functional role of the putative GT GonG4 remains elusive. As a primary hypothesis, we speculated a role for GonG4 on transferring 2-deoxy-l-fucose or l-rhodinose as second sugar moiety. However, neither PM100117 nor PM100118 production was detected upon gonG4 over-expression in \u0394gonG2 mutant strain (Fig.\u00a05d). Alternatively, GonG4 might be inactive, but sequence alignment with functional glycosyltransferases did not reveal obvious differences supporting that possibility, or require post-translational regulatory signals for its activation. Moreover, it seems plausible also to contemplate that under certain environmental conditions, GonG4 might have a role on transferring 2,6DOH moieties other than l-axenose, 2-deoxy-l-fucose or l-rhodinose, leading to the production of natural PM100117/18 derivatives. This is consistent with the presence in the PM100117/18 gene cluster of two ORFs, gonR1 and gonR2, coding for putative 4-ketoreductase enzymes. Their presence in the cluster allows us to speculate with the biosynthesis of additional 2,6DOHs. For instance, last step of 2-deoxy-l-fucose an l-rhodinose biosynthesis could be branched towards the formation of l-olivose and l-amicetose, respectively, if either GonR1 or GonR2 were able to produce hydroxyl groups in equatorial configuration at C4. However, based on sequence analysis data, it is not possible to forecast the resulting stereo configuration after GonR1 and/or GonR2 activity. Otherwise, we cannot rule out the biosynthesis of other 2,6DOHs by the activity of enzymes encoded in other locations of S. caniferus chromosome.", "Gene deletion experiments have also enabled the identification of GTs responsible for transfer of each 2,6DOH sugar moiety to its corresponding position of the PM100117/18 glycosylation pattern.

When genes coding for these putative GTs are individually deleted, none of the two remaining GTs is flexible to catalyze the transfer of its own natural sugar to the acceptor aglycone. This apparently low promiscuity of the three GTs towards the acceptor substrate contrasts with the flexibility showed by GonG1 to transfer l-rhodinose (compounds 3 and 4) as first sugar moiety to the PM100117/18 polyketide ring (Fig.\u00a03) in the \u0394gonCM mutant, in which l-axenose biosynthesis is presumably suppressed. Another interesting observation from the structure of the compounds detected in mutants \u0394gonCM and \u0394gonG2 is the production of a derivative with a hydroxyl functional group at C18 of the PM100117/18 macrolactone ring (compounds 3 and 11), a feature also observed in the polyketide skeleton of the structurally related antibiotic brasilinolide A [43].
