Increasing numbers of infectious diseases caused by bacteria and viruses make it necessary to constantly find new natural products serving as drug candidates also against antimicrobial resistant pathogens.

In addition, there are numerous tools and databases for the prediction of genes related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites that enable simple and accurate genome mining [12, 13]. In general, the predicted number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for the production of natural products in any genome outcompetes the number of produced natural product types observed under laboratory conditions [14]. Therefore, robust and versatile molecular tools need to be developed to activate BGCs that might be silent under laboratory conditions. One possibility is to express the BGC heterologous in related organisms [15]. For this purpose, several methods have been established to assemble large DNA fragments, such as TAR cloning (Transformation-Associated Recombination) and ExoCET, which is based on the Red/ET recombineering tool [16\u201319]. Another way to activate BGCs is to manipulate the regulatory network in the native host. Since promoters are the first target for regulatory mechanisms, methods have been developed to increase their strength, replace them with a set of regulatory sequences with known functions resulting in the exchange of the natural against an inducible promoter [20] or to prevent binding of repressors to the promoter sequence [21]. Various methods have been developed for this purpose, such as a phage recombinase-based knock-in approach, in which an antibiotic resistance gene including promoter was integrated in front of a gene cluster [22, 23].

Their architecture allows to quickly adapting the origin of replication and resistance gene to the desired strain. We linearized the vectors and assembled them with modified promoters (vanR/PvanCC, lacI/Ptac, cymR/PcymRC and araC/PBad) as described previously [48]. To test their functionality, we additionally assembled the gene encoding the fluorescence protein mNeonGreen on our expression vectors [49]. The vectors were introduced into the target strains by conjugation and tested for expression of mNeonGreen by addition of the inducers directly into the LB-Agar. We therefore were able to generate a library of 26 vectors with the resistance genes for gentamycin, kanamycin and chloramphenicol as well as the replication origins pBBR1, p15A, pUC, RK2, RSF1010 and pRO1600/ColE1 (Table S1, Plasmids).", "Optimization of the two-plasmid-based CRISPR/Cpf1 method for Photorhabdus", "Optimization of the two-plasmid-based CRISPR/Cpf1 method for Photorhabdus", "Optimization of the two-plasmid-based CRISPR/Cpf1 method for Photorhabdus", "The CRISPR/Cpf1 editing method described here is based on the method previously described for E. coli [50].

The activation of the putative safracin-associated BGC, named xsc, in Xenorhabdus sp. TS4 is such an example due to its bidirectional architecture (Fig.\u00a02A I). In initial experiments, the cluster was amplified in three parts and assembled on expression vectors, which were subsequently transformed into E. coli mtaA in various combinations (Fig. S6). It was possible to produce different safracin derivatives with putative biosynthetic intermediates (Fig. S6 A-C). However, only small amounts of about 14\u00a0mg/L of SAC-B were produced (Fig.\u00a02C). For this reason, we decided to use our developed method for targeted cluster refactoring. For activation of the xsc cluster (Fig.\u00a02A I), the modified strong inducible vanR/PvanCC promoter was introduced upstream of xscA and a constitutive promoter (PproC) in the opposite direction upstream of xscI (Fig.\u00a02A IIa). In addition, the 5\u2019-UTR between the RiboJ and the start codon was replaced with a translation enhancer sequence (g10T7 UTR (also abbreviated as T7g10), BBa_K1758100 (http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1758100)). Besides the expected main products SAC-A and SAC-B, some putative biosynthetic precursors could be identified, which mainly indicated a weak procession by the SAM dependent N-methyltransferase XscI and FAD-dependent monooxygenase XscJ. To overcome this, we replaced PproC with a stronger constitutive promoter PproD in front of xscI, resulting in strain IIb (Fig.\u00a02A). Furthermore, to gain control over the prodrug/drug formation and to obtain exclusively SAC-B derivatives, we replaced the promoter upstream of xscK encoding the peptidase with a modified lacI/Ptac IPTG inducible promoter while simultaneously deleting the putative resistance gene xscH [68]. The resulting strain III showed an exclusive and increased production of SAC-B in the range of 208\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5\u00a0mg/L. To achieve an even higher level of SAC-B production, we also tried to increase the availability of the modified tyrosine precursor 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-O-methyltyrosine (Fig.\u00a02B) [69]. For this purpose, we introduced the biosynthetic genes xscD-G responsible for its formation on an L-arabinose inducible expression vector into strain III and used the empty vector as control. The introduction of the empty vector led to a drop in SAC-B production, which we assume was caused by stress from the added kanamycin.

It was previously shown [36] that other \u201cunnatural\u201d safracin derivatives could be generated by adding modified precursors such as 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-O-ethyltyrosine. It was also shown previously [70] that functionalization of SAC-B by enzymes from the saframycin biosynthetic pathway of S. lavendulae was possible. We therefore introduced the codon-optimized sfmCy2 gene, encoding a secreted FAD-dependent oxidoreductase, by integration into the genome (Figure S7 B).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of CRISPR technology in the genus Xenorhabdus. The reduction to a single plasmid makes it much easier to work with non-laboratory organisms, which often show reduced growth with two resistance markers. The insertion of synthetic dsDNA fragments carrying both the repair template and the CRISPR target sequence makes vector assembly relatively simple. Furthermore, the easy transferability of the pSEVA vectors by conjugation, enabled by oriT, opens up the potential application to many different bacteria. In contrast to previously described genome editing methods, the process described here is straightforward and does not require the stepwise integration of one or more plasmids into the genome [33, 72]. From the transfer of the vector to the desired and resistance-free production strain, only four steps are required, which can be performed in six days (Fig.\u00a03). On day seven, a new round of editing can be started, allowing rapid sequential editing. In \u201cclassical\u201d BGC activation, R6K ori-based plasmids or a resistance cassette are often introduced in front of the desired gene, which has the disadvantage that iterative rounds of activation are not possible [22, 32]. Due to the presence of the sacB gene on our vector and the fact that it is freely replicable, it can be easily cured by the addition of sucrose. Furthermore, our method is efficient for small and large deletions, as well as for smaller insertions, such as the insertion of inducible promoter sequences, without producing chimeric colonies (Table\u00a01). We hypothesize that this is due to the use of two CRISPR sites per target. Targeting both ends of the sequence to be edited increases efficiency, as has been shown for Streptomyces [73]. Based on our technology, production titers of the high-value compound safracin B could be increased far beyond titers previously described [36]. Genomic integration of modifying enzymes also increased product variability and yielded a new, previously undescribed derivative 24. The application of the single plasmid system and pSEVA based expression plasmids should therefore facilitate a variety of future studies in Photorhabdus, Xenorhabdus, as well as other bacteria, including regulatory network analysis, activation of silent natural product gene clusters, introduction of novel metabolic pathways, and design of optimized chassis strains for heterologous production of desired natural products.", "In this work, we describe a simple and easy-to-use method for markerless genome editing in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus.
