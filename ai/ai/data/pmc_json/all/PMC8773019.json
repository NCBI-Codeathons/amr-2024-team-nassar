Introduction", "Tomato Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol), is one of the most destructive diseases, causing a considerable loss in the production of both field and greenhouse tomatoes worldwide [1]. Since Fusarium wilt is a difficult disease to control [2,3,4], control strategies including physical and cultural methods, chemical fungicides treatment, and the cultivation of resistance tomato cultivars [5] achieved limited efficacy [6]. In addition, excessive usage of agrochemicals imposed serious negative impacts on the environment, causing the pollution of soil and groundwater reservoirs, an accumulation of chemical residues in the food chain, an emergence of pesticide-resistance pathogens, and health hazards [7]. As a result, biocontrol microbes have been suggested as a promising alternative to agrochemicals in plant disease control. Numerous biocontrol microbes, especially Bacillus strains, have been commercially developed as biopesticides and biofertilizers worldwide [7].", "Tomato Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol), is one of the most destructive diseases, causing a considerable loss in the production of both field and greenhouse tomatoes worldwide [1].

The investigation of biocontrol microbes through conventional genetic and biochemical approaches could not unveil the full potential of these microbes due to the absence of appropriate natural triggers or stress signals under laboratory conditions [12]. With the development of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and genome mining, along with MS-based analytical methods (e.g., GC/LC-MS, LC-ESI-MS, and MALDI-TOF-MS), more potential biocontrol microbes can be revealed. For instance, the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 genome contains nine giant gene clusters synthesizing secondary metabolites which are involved in the suppression of soil-born plant pathogens. Several gene/gene clusters are implicated in swarming motility, plant colonization, biofilm formation, and the synthesis of plant growth-promoting volatile compounds and hormones [13]. A wide range of extracellular proteins and phytase in the FZB42 secretome were detected through two-dimensional electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF-MS, and the proteomics approach, indicating this strain can grow on the plant\u2019s surface and supply phosphorus for the plant under phosphorus starvation.

The genome of the KR2-7 harbored als gene cluster (alsR, alsS, alsD), along with the bdhA gene is together required for the biosynthesis pathway of 2,3-butanediol from pyruvate. In this pathway, alsS encodes the acetolactate synthase enzyme, which catalyzes the condensation of two pyruvate molecules into acetolactate. Then, acetolactate decarboxylase, encoded by alsD, converts decarboxylate acetolactate into acetoin. The alsR regulates two aforesaid steps. Finally, the bdhA encoded (R, R)-butanediol dehydrogenase enzyme catalyzes 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (acetoin) to 2,3-butanediol [111]. In addition, the KR2-7 genome contained ilvH, ilvB, ilvC genes and a leu gene cluster (leuABCD) which are required for the biosynthesis pathway of three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), including leucine, isoleucine, and valine.

Discussion", "4. Discussion", "Previously, the Bacillus subtilis species complex was composed of four close subspecies, i.e., subspecies subtilis, spizizenii, inaquosorum, and stercoris, which were differentiated through a phylogenetic analysis of multiple protein-coding genes and genome-based comparative analysis [114,115]. B. subtilis subsp. Inaquosorum was deemed as a distinctive taxon encompassing strains KCTC 13429 and NRRL B-14697 [116]. Recent phylogenomic studies clearly distinguished subspecies inaquosorum from subspecies spizizenii, as the estimated ANI among them was smaller than the defined ANI for species delineation (95% ANI) [117]. In addition to a low ANI value (<95%), the BGC of subtilin exclusively presents in the genomes of subspecies spizizenii, but was not characterized in subspecies inaquosorum genome [115]. Accordingly, B. inaquosorum KR2-7 was clearly differentiated from B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii W23 because of the low ANI value among them (94.18%) and the lack of subtilin gene cluster in the genome content of strain KR2-7. In addition, it was reported that B. inaquosorum is the only species to produce bacillomycin F. It was approved by detecting a unique MALDI-TOF-MS biomarker at m/z 1120 in the MALDI-TOF-MS spectra of B. inaquosorum that cannot be produced by other species [114]. Since this unique biomarker (m/z value 1120.6) was observed in the MALDI-TOF-MS spectra of strain KR2-7, it can be concluded that this strain is a B. inaquosorum. Recently, the ability of B. inaquosorum strain HU Biol-II in producing bacillomycin F was confirmed through HPLC MS/MS [15]. Most recently, subspecies spizizenii, inaquosorum, and stercoris were promoted to species status through a comparative genome study [118].

This strain can efficiently colonize the plant root surface, relying on its swarming motility and biofilm formation abilities. Efficient root colonization of biocontrol bacteria is necessary for suppressing phytopathogens, and biofilm formation is an essential prerequisite for persistent root colonization [119,120]. The biofilm-deficient mutant of B. pumilus HR10 produced weakened biofilms with reduced contents of extracellular polysaccharides and proteins, and thereby could not efficiently control pine seedling damping-off disease [121].

Hence, the suppression of tomato Fusarium wilt by strain KR2-7 [16] may contribute to efficient tomato root colonization of this strain.", "In addition to efficient root colonization, strain KR2-7 is able to directly suppress soil-dwelling phytopathogens through producing eight antimicrobial secondary metabolites, e.g., fengycin, surfactin, bacillomycin F, macrolactin, bacillaene, bacilysin, subtilosin A, and sporulation killing factor. The combination of obtained data via MALDI-TOF-MS with our previous observations [16] confirmed that strain KR2-7 produced at least four bioactive metabolites (including fengycin, surfactin, macrolactin, and bacillaene) to directly protect the tomato plant from the invasion and penetration of Fol. The cyclic lipodecapeptide fengycin exhibits strong fungitoxic properties by inhibiting phospholipase A2 and aromatase functions [122], disruption of biological membrane integrity [123], deformation and permeabilization of hyphae [124,125], and induction of ISR [126]. In this context, the strong antifungal activity of B. inaquosorum strain HU Biol-II against a diverse group of fungi highly pertained to the fengycin produced by this strain. Interestingly, 97.47% of the ppsA-E gene cluster in KR2-7 was similar to the fengycin gene cluster in strain HU Biol-II [15]. Fengycin produced by B. subtilis SQR9 and B. amyloliquefaciens NJN-6 significantly inhibited the growth of F. oxysporum [127,128]. Moreover, fengycin BS155 isolated from B. subtilis BS155 destroyed Magnaporthe grisea through damaging the plasma membrane and cell wall, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), chromatin condensation, and the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [129]. In addition to fengycin, the contribution of other secondary metabolites in the biocontrol of various pathogens has been reported. The supernatant of B. subtilis GLB191, consisting of surfactin and fengycin, highly controlled grapevine downy mildew caused by Plasmopara viticola by means of direct antagonistic activity and the stimulation of plant defence [51]. Furthermore, the strong antifungal effect of B. velezensis strains Y6 and F7 against Ralstonia solanacearum and F. oxysporum was attributed to the production of fengycin, iturin, and surfactin, among which iturin played a key role in the suppression of F. oxysporum [130].

Phytate (inositol hexa- and penta-phosphates) is the predominant form of soil organic phosphorus, which is unavailable for plant uptake due to the rapid immobilization of phosphorus and the lack of adequate phytase levels in plants [131]. Phytase is a phosphatase enzyme responsible for the transformation of organic phytate to inorganic phosphate, which is acquirable for plant roots. Similarly, phytase-producing Bacillus strains can effectively enhance plant growth through the liberation of reactive phosphorus from phytate and make this element available for plant uptake. In the presence of phytate, the comparison of the culture filtrate of B. amyloliquefaciens strain FZB45 with those of a phytase-deficient mutant provided evidence that the phytase activity of strain FZB45 enhanced the growth of corn seedling [132]. The bacterization of Brassica juncea with Bacillus sp. PB-13 considerably boost phosphorus content and growth parameters in 30-day-old seedlings [133]. More recently, the soil inoculation of Bacillus strain SD01N-014 resulted in the enhancement of soil phosphorus content and the promotion of maize seedling growth [134]. Accordingly, extracellular phytase activity of strain KR2-7 mediated with phy gene can be expectable. In addition, the presence of genes involved in the biosynthesis of IAA and trehalose in the KR2-7 genome (Table 6) is an indication of this strain\u2019s potential in the mitigation of salt toxic stress on plants. Inoculation of tomato plants subjected to salt stress with OxtreS (trehalose over-expressing strain) mutant of Pseudomonas sp. UW4 considerably boosted the dry weight, root and shoot length, and chlorophyll content of the tomato plant [135]. Moreover, canola seedlings treated with over-expressed IAA transformant of UW4 represented longer primary root with an increased number of root hairs than seedlings treated with wild-type UW4 [136]. The growth promotion of root hairs by IAA improves the assimilation of water and nutrients from the soil, which in turn raises plant biomass [136]. Similarly, Japanese cypress seedlings inoculated with B. velezensis CE 100 showed significant increases in growth parameters and biomass due to the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) by CE 100 strain [137].", "Additionally, strain KR2-7 can exert hormones, such as IAA, phytase, and trehalose for root uptake and rebalance hormones in the host plant to boost growth and stress response.
