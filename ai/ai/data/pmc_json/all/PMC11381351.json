["Abstract", "Efficiency of protein synthesis on the ribosome is strongly affected by the amino acid composition of the assembled amino acid chain. Challenging sequences include proline-rich motifs as well as highly positively and negatively charged amino acid stretches. Members of the F subfamily of ABC ATPases (ABCFs) have been long hypothesised to promote translation of such problematic motifs. In this study we have applied genetics and reporter-based assays to characterise the four housekeeping ABCF ATPases of Bacillus subtilis: YdiF, YfmM, YfmR/Uup and YkpA/YbiT. We show that YfmR cooperates with the translation factor EF-P that promotes translation of Pro-rich motifs. Simultaneous loss of both YfmR and EF-P results in a dramatic growth defect. Surprisingly, this growth defect can be largely suppressed though overexpression of an EF-P variant lacking the otherwise crucial 5-amino-pentanolylated residue K32. Using in vivo reporter assays, we show that overexpression of YfmR can alleviate ribosomal stalling on Asp-Pro motifs. Finally, we demonstrate that YkpA/YbiT promotes translation of positively and negatively charged motifs but is inactive in resolving ribosomal stalls on proline-rich stretches. Collectively, our results provide insights into the function of ABCF translation factors in modulating protein synthesis in B. subtilis.", "Graphical Abstract", "Graphical Abstract", "Graphical Abstract", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Protein synthesis on the ribosome is assisted by an array of dedicated protein factors that participate in all steps of translation: initiation, elongation, termination and recycling.

Bacterial elongation factor P, EF-P, accesses the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center, PTC, to relieve ribosomal stalling on proline-rich motifs (4\u20138). While the C-terminal OB domain of the factor interacts with the mRNA in the E site (4) with the guanosine residue in the first position acting as a recognition element (9), the N-terminal KOW domain stabilises the P-site tRNA in the PTC (4,10). With the notable exception of a group of Actinobacterial species (11,12), in the vast majority of bacteria, PTC stimulation by EF-P requires the posttranslational modification of a conserved lysine residue located in the loop region between beta-strands three and four (\u03b23\u03a9\u03b24) of the KOW domain, with specific modifications differing in different bacterial lineages (13\u201317). In Bacillus subtilis, EF-P is modified with a 5-aminopentanol moiety at Lys32 (15)\u00a0via a multistep assembly pathway that relies on several enzymes: GsaB, YnbB, YmfI, YaaO, YfkA and YwlG (18). GsaB, YnbB and YmfI directly catalyse the EF-P modification while YaaO, YfkA and YwlG are believed to play an indirect role though supporting synthesis of the substrate (18). EF-P is not essential in B. subtilis, nor in Escherichia coli (18,19). EF-P loss results in a pleiotropic phenotype, which in B. subtilis involves compromised sporulation (due to the reduced expression of the Spo0A transcription factor) (20) and swarming mobility (due to the reduced expression of multiple swarming mobility-associated proteins, including FliP and FlhP) (15). However, EF-P is essential in other bacterial species such as Neisseria meningitidis (21), and the eukaryotic EF-P orthologue, eIF5A, is essential in yeast (22) and flies (23). Notably, in addition to its role in promoting translation elongation on proline-rich stretches, eIF5A also plays a crucial role in translation termination (24); no similar function has been shown for EF-P. Finally, numerous bacterial species, including E. coli, encode a second EF-P paralog, named EF-P like (EfpL) or elongation factor P-like protein (YeiP) (9). While the two paralogues have overlapping functions, EfpL and EF-P display a certain degree of functional diversification as they alleviate ribosomal stalling on distinct proline-containing motifs (9).", "While translational GTPases all bind to the ribosomal A (acceptor) site, multiple \u2018accessory\u2019 factors act in the E (exit) site.

The family includes both antibiotic resistance (ARE) factors as well as housekeeping proteins that assist protein synthesis and ribosome assembly (27\u201331). The B. subtilis genome encodes five ABCFs: a dedicated antibiotic resistance factor VmlR (32) and housekeeping factors YdiF, YfmM, YfmR/Uup and YkpA/YbiT (29). The exact functions of housekeeping ABCFs are unclear. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that, analogous to how ARE ABCF resolve ribosome stalling caused by antibiotics (33\u201337), housekeeping ABCFs resolve other stalling events in an NTPase-dependent manner by reaching into the PTC with their P-site tRNA interaction motif (PtIM) domain (27,28,38) (Figure 1). E. coli EttA is by far the best characterised housekeeping ABCF, with structural and biochemical evidence indicating a role in the regulation of the first rounds of translation elongation (27,28,38). The EttA subfamily evolved from the diversity of the Uup ABCF subfamily (29). Several studies suggest a non-ribosomal role for Uup in resolving DNA repair intermediates (39,40) and transposon excision (41). At the same time, disruption of the uup gene in E. coli strain lacking an accessory translational GTPase BipA moderately exacerbates the cold sensitivity and ribosome assembly defects of the \u0394bipA strain, while Uup overexpression of suppresses the defects (33). Given the BipA\u2019s chaperone-like role in late stages of the 50S assembly (42), this genetic interaction is suggestive of Uup playing a role in translation or/and ribosome assembly. The ribosomal function of Uup is further supported by specific inhibition of protein synthesis upon expression of the ATPase-deficient (EQ2) variant due to non-productive association of the Uup-EQ2 variant with the ribosome (33,43). Ectopically overexpressed ABCF-EQ2 variants preferentially bind to the vacant E site of 70S initiation complexes (IC) (27,28) which has been successfully exploited for immunoaffinity-based purification of ABCF-EQ2:IC complexes for structural studies (36,37,44,45).", "The F subfamily of ABC ATPases (ABCFs) comprises another group of E-site-binding translation factors in bacteria (25,26).

The contrast between, on the one hand, the exceedingly strong and specific genetic interaction between efp and yfmR and, on the other hand, the rather modest effects in stalling reporter assays is stark. Even more intriguing is the ability of the EF-P variant lacking the 5-amino-pentanolylated residue K32 to suppress the growth defect of the efp \u0394yfmR strain. While the K32A EF-P variant is inefficient in resolving ribosomal stalling on polyproline, it is clearly competent in assisting YfmR in its biological function. The established function of modified lysine is stabilization of the P-site tRNA CCA end to promote the transpeptidation (4). Importantly, in addition to making contacts with the CCA end, EF-P specifically recognizes the D-arm of tRNAPro (4,68). Therefore, even while the K32A variant is compromised in reaching deep into the PTC, it still can potentially recognize the P-site tRNA identity. As simultaneous ribosomal association of the two E-site-binders is impossible, it is possible that YfmR and EF-P sequentially act on as-yet-unidentified proline-containing stalling motifs, with EF-P first positioning the P-tRNAPro followed by YfmR-mediated resolution of the stall. Furthermore, recent Ribo-Seq experiments have shown that overexpression of EF-P and its paralogue EfpL causes specific ribosomal stalling (9). Therefore, it could be that the function of EF-P is not to promote translation elongation, but to slow it down, thus presenting a relevant ribosomal substrate for YfmR. Finally, it is possible that the strong generic interaction between efp and yfmR is not due to the two factors working together in translation elongation at all. The eukaryotic EF-P orthologue, eIF5A, has been shown to play a key role in ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) (69), where the factor catalyses an elongation-like process on the large ribosomal subunit.
