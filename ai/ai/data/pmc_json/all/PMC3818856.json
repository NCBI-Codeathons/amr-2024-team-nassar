["Summary", "Natural products are traditionally the main source of drug leads. In particular, many antitumour compounds are either natural products or derived from them. However, the search for novel antitumour drugs active against untreatable tumours, with fewer side\u2010effects or with enhanced therapeutic efficiency, is a priority goal in cancer chemotherapy. Microorganisms, particularly actinomycetes, are prolific producers of bioactive compounds, including antitumour drugs, produced as secondary metabolites. Structural genes involved in the biosynthesis of such compounds are normally clustered together with resistance and regulatory genes, which facilitates the isolation of the gene cluster. The characterization of these clusters has represented, during the last 25 years, a great source of genes for the generation of novel derivatives by using combinatorial biosynthesis approaches: gene inactivation, gene expression, heterologous expression of the clusters or mutasynthesis. In addition, these techniques have been also applied to improve the production yields of natural and novel antitumour compounds. In this review we focus on some representative antitumour compounds produced by actinomycetes covering the genetic approaches used to isolate and validate their biosynthesis gene clusters, which finally led to generating novel derivatives and to improving the production yields.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The production of bioactive compounds (antibiotic, antifungal, antitumour, immunosuppressant, antiviral or antiparasitic agents) from living organisms is mainly supported by microorganisms. From them the most prolific producers are fungi, cyanobacteria, myxobacteria and actinobacteria, mainly actinomycetes.

These structures can be composed by monosaccharides (C\u201010127, daunorubicin/doxorubicin, elloramycin, steffimycin and staurosporine), disaccharides (bleomycin, mithramycin and chromomycin A3), trisaccharides (mithramycin and chromomycin A3) and oligosaccharides (landomycin A) (Figs\u20031 and 2).", "The absence of some or all genes involved in the biosynthesis of the sugar from the cluster is the exception rather than the rule. l\u2010rhamnose\u2010containing clusters constitute such an exception.

The involvement of this rhamnose gene cluster in elloramycin biosynthesis was demonstrated by inactivation of the rhaB gene, encoding a 4,6\u2010dehydratase, thus generating a non\u2010producer mutant that accumulated the elloramycin aglycon 8\u2010demethyl\u2010tetracenomycin C (Ramos et\u2003al., 2008).

The S treptomycesAntibiotic Regulatory Protein family (SARP) share sequence similarity with several members of the OmpR family of DNA\u2010binding domains. In particular, regulatory elements of this family are mainly present in aromatic polyketide gene clusters such as those involved in the biosynthesis of daunorubicin (Stutzman\u2010Engwall et\u2003al., 1992), mithramycin (Lomb\u00f3et\u2003al., 1999), chromomycin A3 (Men\u00e9ndez et\u2003al., 2004a) and steffimycin (Gull\u00f3n et\u2003al., 2006). OmpR\u2010 and LuxR\u2010like regulators generally act as activators and TetR\u2010family transcriptional regulators generally act as repressors (Ramos et\u2003al., 2005), but there are examples of TetR\u2010like positive regulators such as AtrA from Streptomyces griseus (Hirano et\u2003al., 2008). Only two clusters (bleomycin and C\u20101027) do not contain any regulatory element of these families (Liu et\u2003al., 2002; Shen et\u2003al., 2002), while daunorubicin cluster contains one of each (Stutzman\u2010Engwall et\u2003al., 1992; Otten et\u2003al., 1995b). The regulation of the daunorubicin/doxorubicin production has been studied in detail. Transcriptional regulator DnrO (BirA/TetR\u2010like) binds specifically to the overlapping dnrN/dnrO promoter region activating the expression of response regulator DnrN that contains a LuxR\u2010like HTH motif. Then, DnrN activates the transcription of dnrI whose product DnrI, a SARP regulator, activates the production of daunorubicin biosynthesis and resistance genes (Madduri and Hutchinson, 1995; Otten et\u2003al., 1995b; 2000; Furuya and Hutchinson, 1996; Sheldon et\u2003al., 2002). In addition, DnrO has been shown to repress its own expression, effect that could be relieved by the presence of rhodomycin D, one of the first glycosylated intermediates in the daunorubicin/doxorubicin pathway, and enhanced by the final products (Jiang and Hutchinson, 2006; Ajithkumar and Prasad, 2010; Srinivasan et\u2003al., 2010). In most cases, inactivation of positive regulatory genes led to completely abolish the biosynthesis of the drug, the exception being mtrY of the mithramycin pathway: its inactivation considerably decreased (but did not abolish) mithramycin biosynthesis (Garcia\u2010Bernardo et\u2003al., 2000). On the other hand, inactivation of negative regulatory genes led to an increase in the production of the respective secondary metabolite. This has been shown for mitomycin C mmcW (Mao et\u2003al., 1999a) and chromomycin A3cmmRII (Men\u00e9ndez et\u2003al., 2007). Some of these regulatory elements, both activators and repressors, might be specifically involved in the control of secondary metabolite resistance/transport systems since they are located next to these elements in several clusters. This is probably the case of regulatory elements mmcW, mtrY and cmmRII from mitomycin C (Mao et\u2003al., 1999a), mithramycin (Garcia\u2010Bernardo et\u2003al., 2000) and chromomycin A3 (Men\u00e9ndez et\u2003al., 2007) gene clusters respectively.", "Approximately half of the pathway\u2010specific activators belong to three groups of transcriptional factors containing DNA binding helix\u2013turn\u2013helix (HTH) signatures: SARP\u2010 (seven cases), LuxR\u2010 (six cases) and TetR\u2010family (six cases) regulators.

The UvrA protein is an E. coli UvrABC complex homologue involved in excision repair of UV\u2010induced DNA lesions (Truglio et\u2003al., 2006). This system has been shown to repair DNA damaged by the free oxygen radicals produced from the interaction of anthracyclines to DNA. The UvrA\u2010like encoding genes have been inactivated in different gene clusters showing various effects. In the daunorubicin gene cluster the inactivation of drrC could only be obtained in a non\u2010producing mutant (Lomovskaya et\u2003al., 1996). Furthermore, the expression of drrC is induced by daunorubicin, and DrrC has been shown to bind DNA in the presence of ATP and daunorubicin (Furuya and Hutchinson, 1998). The inactivation of mtrX has no apparent effect on mithramycin resistance but the expression of this gene into heterologous host S. albus conferred certain level of resistance to mithramycin (Garcia\u2010Bernardo et\u2003al., 2000). The inactivation of cmrX led to a chromomycin A3 sensitive strain that, in addition, showed a decreased production of the compound (Men\u00e9ndez et\u2003al., 2007). Moreover, this gene is required to confer a high level of chormomycin A3 resistance in heterologous hosts. Oxidases have also been reported as resistance mechanisms to mitomycin C and anthracyclines. McrA was shown to be able of re\u2010oxidizing activated mitomycin C before it can initiate the event leading to DNA cross\u2010linking (August et\u2003al., 1994; Johnson et\u2003al., 1997). Two McrA homologues have been identified in the mitomycin gene cluster: MitR and MmcM. The inactivation of mitR and mmcM resulted in reduced mitomycin C production in the mitR mutant strain while mmcM mutant displayed a normal production level (Mao et\u2003al., 1999a). By analogy to McrA, DrrD has been proposed to exert a re\u2010oxidizing activity to counteract the effects of the reduced antitumour drugs daunorubicin and doxorubicin in S. peucetius (Hutchinson, 1997).

The first corresponds to membrane proteins that mediate the extrusion of secondary metabolites in a coupled exchange with protons or sodium ions. The second are ABC (ATP Binging Cassette) transporter systems that couple the transport of the antibiotic through the cell membrane to ATP hydrolysis. The most widely distributed transport systems among the clusters covered in this review are ABC transporters, which have been found as the unique transporters in daunorubicin/doxorubicin (Guilfoile and Hutchinson, 1991), rapamycin (Schwecke et\u2003al., 1995), mithramycin (Fern\u00e1ndez et\u2003al., 1996), chromomycin A3 (Men\u00e9ndez et\u2003al., 2004a), thiocoraline (Lomb\u00f3et\u2003al., 2006) and actinomycin D (Keller et\u2003al., 2010) biosynthesis gene clusters. In the C\u20101027 cluster there are genes encoding a Na+/H+ efflux pump and a membrane protein in addition to the ATP\u2010binding protein of an ABC transporter system (Liu et\u2003al., 2002). In some cases the effect of these systems on the resistance/transport of several compounds has been investigated. The daunorubicin ABC transporter composed by the DrrA ATP\u2010binding protein and the DrrB membrane protein has been shown to confer resistance to daunorubicin/doxorubicin when expressed in S. lividans (Guilfoile and Hutchinson, 1991). On the other hand, disruption of the drrAB genes in S. peucetius resulted in a mutant strain highly sensitive to daunorubicin and with 10\u2010fold decrease in drug production (Srinivasan et\u2003al., 2010). On the contrary, inactivation of mtrA, encoding the ATP\u2010binding component of mithramycin ABC transporter, is lethal to Streptomyces argillaceus and could be only achieved in a non\u2010producing mutant. The expression of mtrAB into S. albus conferred high level of resistance to mithramycin (Fern\u00e1ndez et\u2003al., 1996). In the case of chromomycin A3 ABC transporter, expression of cmrAB in S. albus conferred only low level of chromomycin A3 resistance, but it confers a high level of resistance to 4A,4E\u2010O\u2010dideacetyl\u2010chromomycin A3, a biosynthetic intermediate of chromomycin A3. To achieve a chromomycin A3 high level of resistance in S. albus it was necessary to coexpress the ABC transporter cmrAB together with the UvrA\u2010like encoding gene cmrX. These results pointed to the participation of the ABC transporter CmrAB in the chromomycin A3 biosynthesis process by extrusion of an intermediate that might be then acetylated (final tailoring modification) by the membrane\u2010bound CmmA acetyltransferase, and thus converted into the fully biologically active chromomycin A3 (Men\u00e9ndez et\u2003al., 2007).", "Regarding the transport/resistance systems, these can be grouped in two different classes.

The most widely distributed transport systems among the clusters covered in this review are ABC transporters, which have been found as the unique transporters in daunorubicin/doxorubicin (Guilfoile and Hutchinson, 1991), rapamycin (Schwecke et\u2003al., 1995), mithramycin (Fern\u00e1ndez et\u2003al., 1996), chromomycin A3 (Men\u00e9ndez et\u2003al., 2004a), thiocoraline (Lomb\u00f3et\u2003al., 2006) and actinomycin D (Keller et\u2003al., 2010) biosynthesis gene clusters. In the C\u20101027 cluster there are genes encoding a Na+/H+ efflux pump and a membrane protein in addition to the ATP\u2010binding protein of an ABC transporter system (Liu et\u2003al., 2002). In some cases the effect of these systems on the resistance/transport of several compounds has been investigated. The daunorubicin ABC transporter composed by the DrrA ATP\u2010binding protein and the DrrB membrane protein has been shown to confer resistance to daunorubicin/doxorubicin when expressed in S. lividans (Guilfoile and Hutchinson, 1991). On the other hand, disruption of the drrAB genes in S. peucetius resulted in a mutant strain highly sensitive to daunorubicin and with 10\u2010fold decrease in drug production (Srinivasan et\u2003al., 2010). On the contrary, inactivation of mtrA, encoding the ATP\u2010binding component of mithramycin ABC transporter, is lethal to Streptomyces argillaceus and could be only achieved in a non\u2010producing mutant. The expression of mtrAB into S. albus conferred high level of resistance to mithramycin (Fern\u00e1ndez et\u2003al., 1996). In the case of chromomycin A3 ABC transporter, expression of cmrAB in S. albus conferred only low level of chromomycin A3 resistance, but it confers a high level of resistance to 4A,4E\u2010O\u2010dideacetyl\u2010chromomycin A3, a biosynthetic intermediate of chromomycin A3. To achieve a chromomycin A3 high level of resistance in S. albus it was necessary to coexpress the ABC transporter cmrAB together with the UvrA\u2010like encoding gene cmrX. These results pointed to the participation of the ABC transporter CmrAB in the chromomycin A3 biosynthesis process by extrusion of an intermediate that might be then acetylated (final tailoring modification) by the membrane\u2010bound CmmA acetyltransferase, and thus converted into the fully biologically active chromomycin A3 (Men\u00e9ndez et\u2003al., 2007).", "In some cases, there are drug\u2010binding proteins that confer resistance to the compound by drug sequestering or by participating in the transport process as ligand\u2010binding proteins.

BlmA is a bleomycin\u2010binding protein that confers resistance in E. coli by drug sequestering. In the case of mitomycin C Mrd is a resistance protein that binds the drug conferring 30\u2010fold increase resistance when expressed into E. coli (Sheldon et\u2003al., 1997; 1999). On the other hand, the mitomycin C translocase Mct confers fivefold increase in resistance to mitomycin C in E. coli, while disruption of mct in Streptomyces lavendulae resulted in a strain more sensitive to the drug.

A number of anthracyclines with modification in the glycosylation pattern have been obtained by expressing the steffimycin gene cluster in S. albus together with plasmids directing the biosynthesis of different deoxysugars.

Analogues with improved activity of other aromatic compounds such as mithramycin and elloramycin have been also obtained by modification of the sugar moieties. The expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of different deoxysugars in S. argillaceus led to 11 new mithramycin derivatives with altered glycosylation patterns (Baig et\u2003al., 2008; P\u00e9rez et\u2003al., 2008).

In addition, demycarosyl\u20103D\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010digitoxosyl\u2010mithramycin was highly active against an oestrogen receptor\u2010negative human breast cancer cell line that is not strongly inhibited by mithramycin (Baig et\u2003al., 2008). On the other hand, coexpression of elloramycin gene cluster in S. albus with plasmids directing the biosynthesis of different deoxysugars has led to the isolation of new elloramycin (R1=CH3) and 8\u2010demethyl\u2010tetracenomycin C (R1=H) derivatives (Fig.\u20037) with different sugar moieties (Fischer et\u2003al., 2002; Rodr\u00edguez et\u2003al., 2002; Lomb\u00f3et\u2003al., 2004b; P\u00e9rez et\u2003al., 2005; 2006).

The modification of glycosylation patterns has not only been applied to polyketide natural products. Several indolocarbazole derivatives were generated by using this approach (Salas et\u2003al., 2005). Rebeccamycin, a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, and staurosporine, a promiscuous kinase inhibitor, contain a sugar moiety (Fig.\u20032) attached through a single N\u2010glycosidic bond (rebeccamycin) or by two N\u2010glycosidic bonds (staurosporine). The coexpression of rebeccamycin and staurosporine biosynthesis genes together with plasmids directing the biosynthesis of deoxysugars in S. albus has allowed the generation of novel derivatives from both compounds (Fig.\u20037). Some of these analogues were found highly active against specific kinases. l\u2010olivosyl\u2010arcyriaflavin A is a potent inhibitor of Ikkb, kinase that prevents activation of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway and thus has potential application on inflammation and cancer. On the other hand, l\u2010digitoxosyl\u2010k252c is a subnanomolar JAK2 inhibitor, kinase with potential application in myeloproliferative disorders (S\u00e1nchez et\u2003al., 2009).", "The combination of targeting gene disruption and expression of genes or combinations of genes has been widely used to modify the glycosylation pattern of different antitumour compounds (Figs\u20036 and 7). The important antitumour drug 4\u2032\u2010epidoxorubicin (epirubicin), traditionally obtained semisynthetically, along with its precursor 4\u2032\u2010epidaunorubicin, was generated using a genetically engineered S. peucetius strain defective in the daunosamine biosynthesis gene dnmV. This strain was used to express the avermectin biosynthetic gene avrE from Streptomyces avermitilis or the erythromycin biosynthetic gene eryBIV from Saccharopolyspora erythraea, which led to 4\u2032\u2010epianthracyclines (Madduri et\u2003al., 1998) (Fig.\u20036). A number of anthracyclines with modification in the glycosylation pattern have been obtained by expressing the steffimycin gene cluster in S. albus together with plasmids directing the biosynthesis of different deoxysugars.

In particular, d\u2010digitoxosyl\u20108\u2010demethoxy\u201010\u2010deoxysteffimycin (Fig.\u20037) was found to be 24\u2010fold more active than steffimycin when tested against different human tumour cell lines (Olano et\u2003al., 2008b). Analogues with improved activity of other aromatic compounds such as mithramycin and elloramycin have been also obtained by modification of the sugar moieties. The expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of different deoxysugars in S. argillaceus led to 11 new mithramycin derivatives with altered glycosylation patterns (Baig et\u2003al., 2008; P\u00e9rez et\u2003al., 2008). Two of these, demycarosyl\u20103D\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010digitoxosyl\u2010mithramycin and deoliosyl\u20103C\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010mycarosyl\u2010mithramycin, showed improved activity against an oestrogen receptor\u2010positive human breast cancer cell line.

On the other hand, coexpression of elloramycin gene cluster in S. albus with plasmids directing the biosynthesis of different deoxysugars has led to the isolation of new elloramycin (R1=CH3) and 8\u2010demethyl\u2010tetracenomycin C (R1=H) derivatives (Fig.\u20037) with different sugar moieties (Fischer et\u2003al., 2002; Rodr\u00edguez et\u2003al., 2002; Lomb\u00f3et\u2003al., 2004b; P\u00e9rez et\u2003al., 2005; 2006).

In addition, disruption of dnrU, involved in the transformation of daunorubicin into 13\u2010dihydrodaunorubicin, has a similar effect on doxorubicin production since the production of an undesired compound is abolished (Lomovskaya et\u2003al., 1999). The combination of these beneficial gene disruptions further improved doxorubicin yield, up to sevenfold in the dnrU/dnrX double mutant and to 26\u2010fold in the dnrU/dnrX/dnrH triple mutant. Furthermore, an additional 1.3\u2010 to 2.8\u2010fold increase was obtained by overexpressing in the double or triple mutants mentioned above dnrV and doxA genes involved in late steps during doxorubicin biosynthesis (Lomovskaya et\u2003al., 1999). Using the same approach, overexpression of dnmT, involved in the biosynthesis of daunorubicin deoxysugar l\u2010daunosamine, in the dnrH mutant led to improve daunorubicin production (Scotti and Hutchinson, 1996). The production of 4\u2032\u2010epidaunorubicin in S. peucetius dnmV::avrE was enhanced also by inactivating dnrH and overexpressing dnmT (Madduri et\u2003al., 1998).", "Another approach for improving metabolite production is to remove genes involved in the generation of undesired compounds thus enhancing the yields of the desired one.

This objective can be accomplished by site\u2010directed mutagenesis targeting specific residues in the substrate binding region. Using this approach, elloramycin glycosyltransferase ElmGT that possesses remarkable donor substrate flexibility has been engineered to enhance the production of different 8\u2010demethyl\u2010tetracenomycin C derivatives. As mentioned above ElmGT has been shown to transfer at least 11 different sugars, including both l\u2010 and d\u2010isomeric forms, to its aglycon.
