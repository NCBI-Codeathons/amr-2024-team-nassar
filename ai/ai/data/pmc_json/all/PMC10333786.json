["These authors contributed equally to this work", "Drug efflux pumps transport antimicrobial agents out of bacteria, thereby reducing the intracellular antimicrobial concentration, which is associated with intrinsic and acquired bacterial resistance to these antimicrobials. As genome analysis has advanced, many drug efflux pump genes have been detected in the genomes of bacterial species. In addition to drug resistance, these pumps are involved in various essential physiological functions, such as bacterial adaptation to hostile environments, toxin and metabolite efflux, biofilm formation and quorum sensing. In Gram-negative bacteria, efflux pumps in the resistance\u2013nodulation\u2013division (RND) superfamily play a clinically important role. In this review, we focus on Gram-negative bacteria, including \n\nSalmonella enterica\n\n, \n\nEscherichia coli\n\n and \n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n\n, and discuss the role of RND efflux pumps in drug resistance and physiological functions.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The mechanisms by which bacteria acquire resistance to antimicrobial agents can be classified into four types: inactivation of antimicrobial agents by degradation or chemical modification; antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to a change in the antimicrobial target, in which the site of antimicrobial action is mutated in the bacteria; drug resistance due to changes in membrane permeability; mechanisms that cause bacteria to become resistant by actively exporting antimicrobials and reducing their intracellular concentrations [1]. The first two mechanisms confer resistance to specific or the same class of antibiotics, while the latter two mechanisms increase resistance to a variety of structurally unrelated antibiotics. In many clinically isolated multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, multiple mechanisms are present in the same strain, causing bacterial resistance to many drugs. Because a single multidrug efflux pump can export many structurally unrelated substrates, the elevated expression of even one pump can cause bacteria to become resistant to many compounds.", "The mechanisms by which bacteria acquire resistance to antimicrobial agents can be classified into four types: inactivation of antimicrobial agents by degradation or chemical modification; antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to a change in the antimicrobial target, in which the site of antimicrobial action is mutated in the bacteria; drug resistance due to changes in membrane permeability; mechanisms that cause bacteria to become resistant by actively exporting antimicrobials and reducing their intracellular concentrations [1].

These efflux pumps may have been necessary to counter competition among heterologous bacteria in the environment with antibiotic-producing microbes [9]. Additionally, drug efflux pumps play a fundamental role in survival in various natural environments, including host environments. In particular, RND-type efflux pumps are of interest because of their many functions: pH tolerance and resistance to toxic natural products, metal ions, bile acids, fatty acids and antimicrobial peptides produced by host cells. These RND-type pumps are coupled to an outer membrane protein (OMP), bridged together by periplasmic adaptor proteins (PAPs). Multidrug efflux pumps are also involved in biofilm formation. As 90\u202f% of naturally occurring bacteria form biofilms, which are involved in causing clinically significant infections in host cells, including in humans, the impact of efflux pumps on biofilm formation and drug resistance is immense. Furthermore, several bacterial species perform intercellular communication through quorum sensing. Although quorum sensing signals (QSSs) accumulate in proportion to cell density, efflux pumps also play an essential role in regulating quorum sensing processes.", "Drug efflux pumps, named because of their involvement in bacterial drug resistance, have been conserved across bacterial species since before humans used antimicrobial agents [7, 8].
