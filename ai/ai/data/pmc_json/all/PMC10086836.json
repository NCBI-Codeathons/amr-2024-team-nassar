["Abstract", "Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are fungal secondary metabolites that share a 2,5\u2010diketopiperazine scaffold built from two amino acids and bridged by a sulfide moiety. Modifications of the core and the amino acid side chains, for example by methylations, acetylations, hydroxylations, prenylations, halogenations, cyclizations, and truncations create the structural diversity of ETPs and contribute to their biological activity. However, the key feature responsible for the bioactivities of ETPs is their sulfide moiety. Over the last years, combinations of genome mining, reverse genetics, metabolomics, biochemistry, and structural biology deciphered principles of ETP production. Sulfurization via glutathione and uncovering of the thiols followed by either oxidation or methylation crystallized as fundamental steps that impact expression of the biosynthesis cluster, toxicity and secretion of the metabolite as well as self\u2010tolerance of the producer. This article showcases structure and activity of prototype ETPs such as gliotoxin and discusses the current knowledge on the biosynthesis routes of these exceptional natural products.", "Housing sulfur: Certain fungi produce diketopiperazine compounds with a transannular sulfur bridge. These so\u2010called epipolythiodioxopiperzines are toxic by non\u2010specifically interacting with intracellular proteins and contribute to fungal pathogenicity. Producer strains serve as bio\u2010pesticides but also question safety of food fermentation. Thus, understanding the structure and biosynthesis of these intriguing natural sulfur products is of utmost interest.", "E. M.
