["The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as Joint First Authors.", "Abstract", "Multi-drug resistant pathogens have become a major threat to human health and new antibiotics are urgently needed. Most antibiotics are derived from secondary metabolites produced by bacteria. In order to avoid suicide, these bacteria usually encode resistance genes, in some cases within the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of the respective antibiotic compound. Modern genome mining tools enable researchers to computationally detect and predict BGCs that encode the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The major challenge now is the prioritization of the most promising BGCs encoding antibiotics with novel modes of action. A recently developed target-directed genome mining approach allows researchers to predict the mode of action of the encoded compound of an uncharacterized BGC based on the presence of resistant target genes. In 2017, we introduced the \u2018Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker\u2019 (ARTS). ARTS allows for specific and efficient genome mining for antibiotics with interesting and novel targets by rapidly linking housekeeping and known resistance genes to BGC proximity, duplication and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. Here, we present ARTS 2.0 available at http://arts.ziemertlab.com. ARTS 2.0 now includes options for automated target directed genome mining in all bacterial taxa as well as metagenomic data. Furthermore, it enables comparison of similar BGCs from different genomes and their putative resistance genes.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Due to the continuous increase of drug-resistant bacteria, antibiotic resistance is regarded as a global public health threat (1). The lack of new antibiotics with novel modes of action in the current drug development pipeline, makes finding new compounds to fight off resistant pathogens a critical task (2). Since the discovery of penicillin, secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by various living organisms have been foundational to the development of antimicrobial drugs (3). The majority of antibiotic compounds are isolated as natural products, from fungi and bacteria (4). For many decades, screening biological samples for desired bioactivity has been the traditional methodology for natural product discovery (5). Due to the high rediscovery rates and labor-intensive nature of the process, in silico methods have become a promising way to guide modern drug discovery efforts (6,7). Gene-centered methods, such as genome mining, enable researchers nowadays to computationally detect the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of antibiotics and predict encoded compounds (8). Over the last decade, greatly improved genome mining tools such as antiSMASH (9), EvoMining (10), PRISM (11) or DeepBGC (12) use methods like Hidden Markov Models, phylogeny or deep learning to highlight a variety of natural product classes. Combined with databases such as MIBiG (13), Natural Product Atlas (14) and the antiSMASH database (15), these tools allow for fast and efficient mining and dereplication of thousands of bacterial genomes and BGCs. According to the latest version of the Atlas of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (16) there currently are \u223c400 000 predicted BGCs sequenced. Moreover, <1% of total clusters are experimentally verified, which leads to an important question: Which of these clusters should be further examined with wet lab experiments?", "Due to the continuous increase of drug-resistant bacteria, antibiotic resistance is regarded as a global public health threat (1).

This so called target-directed or self resistance based genome mining approach allows the prediction of the mode of action of the encoded compound of an uncharacterized BGC based on resistance genes, in some cases co-located within the antibiotic BGC (18). Multiple resistance mechanisms exist, such as inactivation and export of antibiotics as well as target modification. In the latter case, a duplicated and antibiotic-resistant homologue of an essential housekeeping gene is detectable within the antibiotic BGC and allows the prediction of the mode of action of the encoded compound even without knowing a chemical structure (19\u201321). Moore et\u00a0al., for example, were able to identify a fatty acid synthase inhibiting antibiotic by screening for duplicated fatty acid synthase genes within orphan BGCs (22).", "Recently, researchers adopted a prioritization approach for antibiotic discovery that is based on the observation that antibiotic producers have to be resistant against their own products to avoid suicide (17).

Since a resistant copy of the antibiotic target gene is typically detectable in the genome, can be observed within the BGC of the antibiotic and horizontally acquired with the BGC (23), ARTS automatically detects possible resistant housekeeping genes based on three criteria: duplication, localization within a biosynthetic gene cluster, and evidence of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). One previous limitation of the ARTS pipeline was its focus on actinobacterial genomes. Although natural product discovery historically was highly focusing on the phylum Actinobacteria, prominent families from other phyla such as Proteobacteria or Firmicutes are known to have high natural product biosynthetic potential (24\u201326).

By design, ARTS aims to survey a wide scope of potential genes as drug targets while minimizing manual inspection by using the dynamic output and multiple screening criteria for more confident target predictions. Thus it is incumbent on the user to examine potential hits with provided metadata and contextual framing. Some of the ARTS hits might be more likely involved in biosynthesis and not associated with resistance. Although we removed common biosynthesis genes from the core gene sets to avoid false positives (23), it is currently not possible to automatically distinguish if genes are more likely involved in biosynthesis or resistance,\u00a0for example fatty acid synthases are involved in both (22). The occasional high counts of positive hits in exploration mode, largely due to undefined cluster boundaries, can be easily and rapidly filtered in the interactive output page. As shown previously, this inspection can even serve to help define the true boundaries of clusters, which remains a largely unresolved challenge when dealing with bacterial BGCs (23). Newly introduced features now make ARTS 2.0 a fast and comprehensive pipeline allowing users to: analyze sequences from all bacterial genomes as well as metagenomic samples, apply comparative analysis on multiple genomes, and interrogate similar BGCs for shared resistant genes.
