A conserved threonine residue at the penultimate position of leader peptide is hitherto found in lasso peptide precursors and shown to be a critical recognition element for effective enzymatic processing. We identified a lasso peptide biosynthetic gene cluster (bsf) from Bradymonas sediminis FA350, a Gram-negative and facultatively prey-dependent bacterium that belongs to a novel bacterial order Bradymonadales in the class Deltaproteobacteria. The kinase BsfK specifically catalyzes the phosphorylation of the precursor peptide BsfA on the Ser3 residue. BsfB1 performs dual functions to accelerate the post-translational phosphorylation and assist BsfB2 in leader peptide removal. Most importantly, the penultimate residue of leader peptide is an isoleucine rather than the conserved threonine and this isoleucine has a marked impact on the phosphorylation of Ser3 as well as leader peptide removal, implying that BsfB1 and BsfB2 exhibit a new substrate selectivity for leader peptide binding and excision. This is the first experimentally validated penultimate isoleucine residue in a lasso peptide precursor to our knowledge. In silico analysis reveals that the leader peptide Ile/Val(-2) residue is rare but not uncommon in phosphorylated lasso peptides, as this residue is also discovered in Acidobacteriaceae and Sphingomonadales in addition to Bradymonadales.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Lasso peptides are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) with a characteristic lariat topology, in which the C-terminal tail threads through the macrolactam ring formed by the N-terminal amino group and the carboxylic acid side chain of an aspartate or a glutamate located at position 7\u20139 of the core peptide via an isopeptide bond (Hegemann et al., 2015; Martin-G\u00f3mez and Tulla-Puche, 2018). The number and position of disulfide linkages are used to categorize lasso peptides into four classes, among which class II is the most frequently encountered and features no disulfide bridge, and the lasso topology is stabilized only by steric interactions above and below the ring (Zhao et al., 2016; Martin-G\u00f3mez and Tulla-Puche, 2018; Cheng and Hua, 2020; Hegemann et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). Generally speaking, the biosynthesis of lasso peptides requires at least three proteins, including a precursor peptide (A), a cysteine protease (B) with homology to transglutaminases, and an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent macrolactam synthetase (C) homologous to asparagine synthetases (Supplementary Figure S1). Many lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) also contain a fourth gene encoding an ABC-transporter (D), which is responsible for excretion and self-resistance. B genes from actinobacteria and firmicutes are usually split into two genes: B1 encodes the N-terminal RiPP precursor recognition element (RRE) domain with homology to PqqD family proteins, while B2 encodes the C-terminal protease domain that cleaves the leader peptide of the precursor, after which the remanent core peptide is macrolactamized to form the mature lasso peptide (Burkhart et al., 2015; Hegemann et al., 2015; Martin-G\u00f3mez and Tulla-Puche, 2018).", "Lasso peptides are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) with a characteristic lariat topology, in which the C-terminal tail threads through the macrolactam ring formed by the N-terminal amino group and the carboxylic acid side chain of an aspartate or a glutamate located at position 7\u20139 of the core peptide via an isopeptide bond (Hegemann et al., 2015; Martin-G\u00f3mez and Tulla-Puche, 2018).

Assays with the I(-2)L, I(-2)T, and I(-2)A variants of BsfA yielded similar results to the assay with BsfA I(-2)V (Figures 7A, 8A), implying that the penultimate residue in the leader peptide has a great influence on the degree of phosphorylation. Tandem MS analysis of BsfA I(-2)A after trypsin digestion identified Ser3 as the polyphosphorylated residue, which was corroborated by the observation that the BsfA I(-2A)&S3A variant could not be phosphorylated (Supplementary Figure S15; Supplementary Table S5). Polyphosphorylations on C-terminal serine residues were reported for ThcoK and SyanK (Zhu et al., 2016b), whereas our result pointed to (poly)phosphorylation on a ring residue of the lasso peptide.", "We were curious to know whether the leader peptide Ile(-2) residue in BsfA also plays a role in phosphorylation and leader peptide removal. This residue was targeted for replacement with other amino acids. Ile(-2) was first exchanged with the congener leucine residue in BsfA, which was then co-expressed with BsfB1 and BsfK. HPLC-ESI-HRMS analysis of the BsfA variant after purification and desalting revealed that only part of the precursor peptide was phosphorylated (Figure 5A), compared with the wild type BsfA where almost all the precursor was phosphorylated (Supplementary Figure S5). Most of the I(-2)V precursor peptide was phosphorylated, while in addition to the major monophosphorylated precursor, we detected a considerable amount of polyphosphorylated precursor peptides (Figure 6A), which were less detectable in wild type BsfA.

In contrast to the wild type BsfA that was cleaved almost completely, I(-2)T as well as I(-2)A exchanges completely hindered the removal of the leader peptide even in the presence of BsfB1 (Figures 7B, 8B). In assays using the I(-2)L and I(-2)V exchange variants, barely any leader cleavage was observed either (Figures 5B, 6B). Very recently, RRE domains in lasso peptide biosynthesis were shown not only to deliver the precursor peptide to the leader peptidase, but also to partially compose the elusive S2 proteolytic pocket that binds the penultimate residue of the leader peptides. A critical tyrosine residue (Tyr33 in FusE) in these RRE domains is suspected to directly engage Thr(-2), perhaps via side chain H-bonding (Alfi et al., 2022; Kretsch et al., 2023). However, this is unlikely for the case of BsfB1, as the Ile(-2) residue does not contain polar groups for such kind of interactions. Sequence alignment reveals that BsfB1 also contains this tyrosine residue (Tyr37 in BsfB1), but this residue is not conserved in Bradymonadales derived B1 proteins (Supplementary Figure S16). The interaction between BsfB1 and the penultimate isoleucine residue in BsfA remains largely enigmatic and is worthy of further investigation. Thus, we speculate that the penultimate isoleucine residue in BsfA affects both BsfB1 and BsfB2, and that these proteins exhibit a new substrate selectivity for leader peptide binding and excision.", "The BsfA Ile(-2) substitution variants were furthermore utilized for the characterization of TF-BsfB2 activity.
