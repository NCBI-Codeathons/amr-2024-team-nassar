["These authors contributed equally to this work", "Last year ActinoBase, a Wiki-style initiative supported by the UK Microbiology Society, published a review highlighting the research of particular interest to the actinomycete community. Here, we present the second ActinoBase review showcasing selected reports published in 2020 and early 2021, integrating perspectives in the actinomycete field. Actinomycetes are well-known for their unsurpassed ability to produce specialised metabolites, of which many are used as therapeutic agents with antibacterial, antifungal, or immunosuppressive activities. Much research is carried out to understand the purpose of these metabolites in the environment, either within communities or in host interactions. Moreover, many efforts have been placed in developing computational tools to handle big data, simplify experimental design, and find new biosynthetic gene cluster prioritisation strategies. Alongside, synthetic biology has provided advances in tools to elucidate the biosynthesis of these metabolites. Additionally, there are still mysteries to be uncovered in understanding the fundamentals of filamentous actinomycetes' developmental cycle and regulation of their metabolism. This review focuses on research using integrative methodologies and approaches to understand the bigger picture of actinomycete biology, covering four research areas: i) technology and methodology; ii) specialised metabolites; iii) development and regulation; and iv) ecology and host interactions.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "ActinoBase (https://actinobase.org) was established in 2019 with the support of the UK Microbiology Society as a Wiki-style initiative for the actinomycete research community.

They are widely distributed across ecosystems, ubiquitous in soil and water habitats, and can live in symbiosis with higher eukaryotes [3]. A striking feature of actinomycetes is that they produce chemically diverse specialised metabolites (SMs). SMs are compounds not essential for maintenance and growth, but often play a critical role in interspecies interactions [4]. Additionally, many SMs are of therapeutical value [5], constituting a rich resource for drug discovery [6]. SMs are often referred to as natural products (NPs) as well, this wider term encompasses any compound made by a living organism. Due to the current antimicrobial crisis, there is a need to improve the finding of novel antibiotics from actinomycetes, by developing advances in the detection/production pipeline, and applying integrative approaches to unveil SMs function [7]. For instance, SMs production in \n\nStreptomyces\n\n is linked to its life cycle [8\u201310], highlighting the importance of understanding its complex developmental regulation [11].", "Actinobacteria are Gram-positive high GC content bacteria, with a diverse range of morphologies ranging from unicellular cocci or rods to multicellular filamentous hyphae and spore-forming organisms depending on their genera [2].

The genomic era has opened a new roadmap for the study of BGCs with genome mining as a prominent strategy to find candidates for novel bioactive compounds [4, 13, 14]. This has allowed researchers to uncover thousands of new BGCs of different classes, including polyketides (PKs); non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) [15\u201318]; PK-NRP hybrid compounds; ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) such as lanthipeptides or thiopeptides [19\u201321]; and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [22, 23]; among others [24\u201328].", "SMs are genetically encoded small molecules produced by a group of co-occurring genes referred to as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), involved in synthesising one or more structurally-similar molecules [5, 12].

Moreover, many computational tools for high-throughput data mining have been developed to support BGCs prioritisation and dereplication [31]. Handling big data requires prioritisation to establish selection criteria for certain BGCs based on the specific research context [32]. Dereplication is selecting a BGC based on its novelty, often achieved by comparing with databases such as Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster (MIBiG) [33, 34].", "Although genomics has revealed key elements of SMs biosynthesis, there are still challenges to overcome.

First, eGFP-tagged \n\nStreptomyces\n\n strains were re-infected into A. thaliana roots to verify the ability of the endophyte to recolonise plants. Then, all the genome-sequenced strains were inoculated into seedlings to investigate their effect on growth.

Moreover, they possess several BGCs involved in siderophores and antimicrobial compounds. Among them, strain N2 shows a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and produces filipin-like polyenes, including 14-hydroxyisochainin. N2 antifungal activity was improved two-fold in the presence of IAA, suggesting that N2 may display its activity in proximity to the plant root when competing with other microbes. Additionally, coating wheat seed with N2 protects the germinating seedlings from the take-all fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, an economically important wheat pathogen.", "Genome mining and bioassays of all the eight sequenced strains revealed that they produce PGP compounds, including indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and ACC deaminase.

However, two of the five root-associated \n\nStreptomyces\n\n strains showed a negative in vitro effect regarding A. thaliana\u2019s biomass. Therefore, the effects of \n\nStreptomyces\n\n strains on host plants seem to be strain-dependent, and further research is needed to understand their role in these interactions. Nevertheless, the authors achieve to develop a system for studying the role of SMs in nature that may provide new insights to activate silent BGCs. Specifically, they demonstrate that IAA increased the antifungal activity of one of the root-associated \n\nStreptomyces\n\n strains, providing evidence of how external signals can affect the expression of SMs. In addition, exploring plant-\n\nStreptomyces\n\n interactions led to the identification of novel PGP and biocontrol agents that could be developed as active biofertilizers, as greener alternatives to pesticides currently having a negative impact in ecosystems.

The accessible cost of whole-genome sequencing enabled the exploration of not only few, but whole collections of strains. Over a relatively short period of time, the amount of available genomic data increased exponentially and is bound to continue. Likewise, other omics technologies such as metabolomics and transcriptomics have experienced a similar data expansion. Consequently, it is no surprise that efforts are focused on developing computational tools to handle this big data. BiG-SLiCE and BiG-FAM have recently expanded the BiG-SCAPE family, enabling us to compare millions of BGCs, and group them into gene cluster families. Moreover, additional tools such as Qemistree, which allows hierarchical tree clustering based on chemical similarity; and NPLinker, that link both genomic and metabolomic data, permits actinomycete research to approach old problems from a different angle, such as the rediscovery of known compounds as well as prioritisation of novel BGCs.", "In the last decade, the genomic era opened a new roadmap for the study of SMs in actinomycetes.
