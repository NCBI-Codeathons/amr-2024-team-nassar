["These two authors contributed equally to this paper.", "Summary", "Edeines, a group of cationic antimicrobial peptides produced by the soil bacterium Brevibacillus, have broad biological effects, such as antimicrobial, anticancer and immunosuppressive activities. However, the yield of edeines in wild\u2010type (WT) Brevibacillus is extremely low, and chemical synthesis of edeines is a time\u2010consuming process. Genetic engineering has proven to be an effective approach to produce antibiotics with high yield. In this study, the edeine biosynthetic gene cluster (ede BGC), which is involved in edeine production, was identified and characterized in Brevibacillus brevis X23. To improve edeine production in B. brevis X23, the ede BGC promoter was replaced with six different promoters, Pmwp, Pspc, PxylA, Pshuttle\u201009, Pgrac or P43, through double\u2010crossover homologous recombination. The new promoters significantly increased the expression of the ede BGC as well as edeine production by 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 to 20.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2010fold and 3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1to 8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u2010fold respectively. The highest yield of edeines (83.6\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121) was obtained in B. brevis X23 with the Pmwp promoter. This study provides a practical approach for producing high yields of edeines in B. brevis.", "The new promoters significantly increased expression of the ede BGC as well as edeine production by 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 to 20.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2010fold and 3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1to 8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u2010fold, respectively.

Edeines A, B, D and F, which exhibit remarkable antibiotic activities, exist as two isomers, the active isomer \u03b1 and the inactive isomer \u03b2 (Fig.\u20091). Among them, edeines A1 and B1 have broad inhibitory activity against Gram\u2010positive and Gram\u2010negative bacteria, fungi, mycoplasmas and cancer cells (Hill et\u00a0al., 1994; Czajgucki et\u00a0al., 2006; Johnson et\u00a0al., 2020) as well as substantial immunosuppressive activity in mice (Kiero\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 1976). Edeines inhibit DNA synthesis at low concentrations (\u2264\u200915\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121) and suppress protein synthesis at high concentrations (\u2265\u2009150\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121) through binding to the P\u2010site of the 30S ribosomal subunit to block t\u2010RNA binding, contributing to their antimicrobial activities (Kurylo\u2010Borowska and Szer, 1972; Pioletti et\u00a0al., 2001). In addition, edeines have been widely used as transcriptional inhibitors to study ribosomal function and protein synthesis (Polikanov et\u00a0al., 2018). However, use of edeines as drugs in human and animals is limited due to their toxicity in animal models (Czajgucki et\u00a0al., 2007). The continuous emergence of multi\u2010drug resistant pathogens is a great challenge to public health, which highlights the re\u2010investigation of obsolete antibiotics such as edeines for new medical applications (Kiero\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 1976; Szaflarski et\u00a0al., 2008).", "Edeines are a group of linear pentapeptides produced by the soil bacterium Brevibacillus (Westman et\u00a0al., 2013).

This impressive power of the Pmwp promoter in driving the expression of ede BGC might be explained as follows. First, the promoter of the cell wall protein gene (HWP) in B. brevis HPD31 has long been regarded as an extremely strong promoter in the exponential period, and it is used in the Brevibacillus Expression System by TaKaRa Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd (Mizukami et\u00a0al., 2010).

The Pmwp promoter was derived from a middle cell wall protein (MWP) gene, which is the homolog of HWP (78% identity in B. brevis X23) (Ebisu et\u00a0al., 1990). Second, based on transcriptomic analyses of B. brevis X23 in the exponential growth period, the MWP gene exhibited the highest transcription among all 6291 coding genes.
