["We report the first secondary metabolite, 8,8\u2032-bijuglone, obtained from pure cultures of the slow growing Douglas fir- (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) foliage-associated fungus Zasmidium pseudotsugae. The quinone was characterized using extensive LC/MS and NMR-based spectroscopic methods. 8,8\u2032-Bijuglone exhibited moderate antibiotic activity against Gram-positive pathogens and weak cytotoxic activity in the NCI-60 cell line panel and in our in-house human colon carcinoma (HCT-116) cell line. An analysis of the fungal genome sequence to assess its metabolic potential was implemented using the bioinformatic tool antiSMASH. In total, 36 putative biosynthetic gene clusters were found with a majority encoding for polyketides (17), followed by non-ribosomal peptides (14), terpenes (2), ribosomal peptides (1), and compounds with mixed biosynthetic origin (2).

However, fungal pathogens, such as Nothophaeocryptopus gaeumannii, the causative agent of Swiss needle cast, have become a serious problem in Douglas-fir populations of western North America, where it has negatively affected the growth and production of this native conifer [2,4,5,6,7,8].

While many natural products are known from Ascomycota, relatively few natural products are known from the Mycosphaerellaceae [12,13,14,15]. The best known are dothistromin, an aflatoxin related compound from Dothistroma septosporum, and metabolites from Cercospora, including perylquinones, for example the light activated phytotoxin cercosporin, and the beticolins (also called cebetins), which are polyketide derived toxins [16].

Effects on mammalian cell viability were determined by measuring the reduction of the tetrazolium salt MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diohenyltetrazolium bromide) by metabolically active cells. HCT-116 cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/mL). The cell lines were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated into 96-well plates at 7000 cells/well cell density, incubated overnight, and treated with the addition of 10 \u00b5g/mL compound and controls to each well. After 48 h, MTT (5 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. The medium was removed, and the purple formazan product solubilized by the addition of 50 \u00b5L of DMSO. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm using the Biotek Synergy 96-well plate reader. Metabolic activity of vehicle-treated cells (0.1% v/v DMSO) was defined as 100% cell growth. Etoposide (250 \u00b5M) was used as a positive control.

Conclusions", "In the current study, a previously described 1,4-naphthoquinone dimer, 8,8\u2032-bijuglone (1) was isolated for the first time from a natural source. The structure of 1 was elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses. 1 showed moderate antibacterial activity and potent cytotoxic activity when tested in a highly enriched extract and exhibited selective activity against leukemia cells when tested in the NCI-60 panel. However, when purified and tested against the human colon carcinoma cell line (HCT-116), only weak activity with an IC50 value of 130 \u00b5M [45 \u00b5g/mL] was observed. Naphthoquinone dimers are known to be redox sensitive with limited solubility. Current efforts are underway to stabilize the compound to allow for in-depth biological tests. Future studies aim to explore the mechanism of self-resistance of Zasmidium against 8,8\u2032-bijuglone, as the compound was observed to be retained in the fungal cells, as well as the effects of 1 in planta. Additionally, genome analysis revealed a surprising large metabolic potential within Zasmidium pseudotsugae. To our knowledge, the current study presents the first secondary metabolite isolated from Z. pseudotsugae and is the first report of its biosynthetic potential using genome analysis approaches.", "In the current study, a previously described 1,4-naphthoquinone dimer, 8,8\u2032-bijuglone (1) was isolated for the first time from a natural source.
