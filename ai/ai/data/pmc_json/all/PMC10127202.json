["", "In\nthis study, an unprecedented myxobacterial siderophore\ntermed\nsorangibactin was discovered by heterologous expression of a coelibactin-like\nnonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster from the Sorangiineae strain MSr11367 in the host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622. De novo structure elucidation\nuncovered a linear polycyclic structure consisting of an N-terminal\nphenol group, an oxazole, tandem N-methyl-thiazolidines,\nand an unusual C-terminal \u03b3-thiolactone moiety. Except for the\nunprecedented oxazoline dehydrogenation to form an oxazole, which\nwe show to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme, other\ntailoring steps were found necessary for efficient downstream processing.\nThe unusual thioesterase (TE) domain is proposed to select homocysteine\nor methionine for offloading involving an intramolecular \u03b3-thiolactone\nformation. Its active site comprises a rare cysteine, which was found\nessential for product formation by point mutation to alanine or serine,\nwhich both abolished its activity.
