["", "Recent advances in\nsequencing techniques unveiled the vast potential\nof ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides\n(RiPPs) encoded in microbiomes. Class I lantibiotics such as nisin\nA, widely used as a food preservative, have been investigated for\ntheir efficacy in killing pathogens. However, the impact of nisin\nand nisin-like class I lantibiotics on commensal bacteria residing\nin the human gut remains unclear. Here, we report six gut-derived\nclass I lantibiotics that are close homologues of nisin, four of which\nare novel. We applied an improved lantibiotic expression platform\nto produce and purify these lantibiotics for antimicrobial assays.\nWe determined their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against\nboth Gram-positive human pathogens and gut commensals and profiled\nthe lantibiotic resistance genes in these pathogens and commensals.\nStructure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) studies with analogs\nrevealed key regions and residues that impact their antimicrobial\nproperties.
