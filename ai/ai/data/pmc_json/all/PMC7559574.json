["This paper summarizes information about the division of bacteriocins into classes (Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and archaea). Methods for producing bacteriocins have been studied. It is known that bacteriocins, most successfully used today are products of secondary metabolism of lactic acid bacteria. It is established that the main method of bacteriocin research is PCR analysis, which makes it possible to quickly and easily identify the presence of bacteriocin encoding genes. The mechanism of cytotoxic action of bacteriocins has been studied. It is proved that the study of cytotoxic (antitumor) activity in laboratory conditions will lead to the clinical use of bacteriocins for cancer treatment in the near future. It is established that the incorporation of bacteriocins into nanoparticles and targeted delivery to areas of infection may soon become an effective treatment method. The delivery of bacteriocins in a concentrated form, such as encapsulated in nanoparticles, will increase their effectiveness and minimize potential toxic side effects. The analysis of publications on this topic confirmed that diverse research on bacteriocins is relevant.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized proteins or short polypeptides that have antibacterial activity and are closely related to the producing strain. Bacteriocins act by interacting and destroying cells with specific surface receptors [1]. In a microbial community, cells can be bacteriocinogenic (produce bacteriocin), sensitive, or resistant to each bacteriocin. When all three cell types are present and compete for limited resources, only a small percentage of bacteriocinogenic cells will be induced to produce and release bacteriocin [2]. Some sensitive cells are immediately destroyed, while others contain mutations that determine their resistance. Resistant cells quickly displace producing cells due to the bacteriocin production \u201ccost\u201d [3].", "Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized proteins or short polypeptides that have antibacterial activity and are closely related to the producing strain.

A number of bacteriocins from a wide variety of bacteria are discovered and their various structures are described. More and more data indicate that bacteriocins have different structures, modes of action, mechanisms of biosynthesis and self-immunity, as well as gene regulation. Bacteriocins are considered an attractive compound to use in the food and pharmaceutical industries for preventing food spoilage and the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, the elucidation of their biosynthesis led to the use of gene expression systems controlled by bacteriocin and enzymes of biosynthesis of lantibiotics, a class of bacteriocins, as tools for the creation of new peptides [9].", "Bacteriocins are antibacterial peptides synthesized by ribosomes produced by bacteria that inhibit the growth of similar or closely related bacterial strains [9].

Studies of the modes of action of bacteriocins focus on two different action aspects\u2014kinetics of the physical interaction between bacteriocin and susceptible cells and detection of specific biochemical lesions in target cells [10]. It is widely hypothesized that the interaction of bacteriocin with the target cell occurs in two stages. The first stage, which is probably reversible, corresponds to the physical adsorption of bacteriocin in the cell using receptors. Removing the bacteriocin at this stage appears to leave the cell intact, since there is no permanent physiological damage. The second stage leads to irreversible pathological changes as a result of specific biochemical damage to the cell [2].", "A huge variety of chemical structures allows bacteriocins to affect various vital functions of a living cell (transcription, translation, replication, and cell wall biosynthesis), but most act by forming membrane channels or pores that violate the energy potential [2].

One of these mechanisms is associated with the production of bacteriocins, peptides with antimicrobial activity. Bacteriocins are found in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, bacteriocins produced by Gram-positive bacteria are of particular interest, due to the industrial use of several strains belonging to this group, especially lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which have the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status. This paper discusses the latest trends in the field of inventions and the state of the art related to the production of bacteriocin by Gram-positive microorganisms. Since 1965, one hundred and eight patents relating to manufacturers of Gram-positive bacteriocins have been filed, 57% of which are related bacteriocins derived from Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Pediococcus strains. Surprisingly, patents for the production of heterologous bacteriocins have been presented mainly only in the last decade.

The first compound of this class, subtilosin A, was discovered more than 30 years ago. Sactiotics form rigid hydrocarbon skeleton structures, while the residues of amino acids are located on the surface of the spirals and have a negative charge at a neutral pH, which causes the hydrophobicity of bactericins. The absence of a common cationic charge suggests that sactibiotics are not attracted to the membrane. Combined with a narrow spectrum of action it indicates the interaction of sactibiotics with defined receptors. According to research, subtilosin A uses Trp34 as a membrane anchor and leaves anionic amino acid residues on the surface. Additionally, the peptide can partially embed itself in the membrane and destroy the phosphate head groups and methylene groups of lipids. The destruction of the membrane depends on the concentration of bacteriocin and leads to leakage of vesicular components [49]. Sactipeptides are also referred to as sactibiotics. Sactipeptides are RiPPs bacteriocins containing one or multiple sactionine linkages or sulfur-to-\u03b1 carbon thiother (sacti) linkages, i.e., crosslinks between the sulfur (S) atom of a Cys and the \u03b1-carbon (C\u03b1) of an acceptor amino acid residue [46].

Subtilosin A, Thuricins and SKF are produced by Bacillus strains.

Bacteriocins have a relatively narrow spectrum of action, because they are active against bacteria of the same or phylogenetically related species, which are cancer cells. The action of bacteriocins is selective, and they are able to specifically bind only to cancer cells [16]. Increasing the expression of negatively charged molecules on the surface of cancer cells makes them vulnerable to the cytotoxic activity of bacteriocins [56]. Cytotoxicity mechanisms include induction of apoptosis and/or depolarization of the cell membrane, which leads to changes in permeability. Some of them can cause both necrosis and apoptosis. Studies measuring the membrane potential demonstrate that, within a few seconds after the interaction of cytotoxic bacteriocin with a sensitive eukaryotic cell, its surface is depolarized and its permeability increases, leading to cell death. Rapid destruction caused by cytotoxic bacteriocins may indicate a non-receptor mechanism of action [55].", "The cytotoxicity of bacteriocins and their ability to affect cancer cells may depend on structural properties such as the number of positively charged amino acids, hydrophobicity, and the ability to form amphipathic structures and oligomers.

The advantages of bacteriocins as therapeutic agents are that they are small peptides and thus, for the most part, are not immunogenic in nature. Second, they are easily hydrolyzed to simple amino acids [59]. One of the main problems of using bacteriocins as medicines is the reduction of stability in the intestines or human tissues. Attempts have been made to chemically synthesize peptides that include D-amino acids, which are less susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in the gut. Analogs of lactococcin G were synthesized with N-and C-terminal residues replaced with D-amino acids that have a reduced sensitivity to the action of exopeptidases without significant effect on activity. Directed changes in trypsin recognition sites in salivaricin P resulted in a stable compound with a slight change in its activity. Such studies aimed at improving the stability and effectiveness of antitumor bacteriocins are justified. In addition, functional carriers for directed and controlled delivery of bacteriocins can also improve their stability in vivo [57].", "Despite the fact that the cytotoxic potential of bacteriocins has been studied in the laboratory, there is no data on the effectiveness for cancer treatment.
