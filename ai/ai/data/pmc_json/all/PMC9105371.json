["A method to identify anticancer compounds in plants was proposed based on the hypothesis that these compounds are primarily present in plants to provide them with an ecological advantage over neighboring plants and other competitors. According to this view, identifying plants that contain compounds that inhibit or interfere with the development of other plant species may facilitate the discovery of novel anticancer agents. The method was developed and tested using Magnolia grandiflora, Gynoxys verrucosa, Picradeniopsis oppositifolia, and Hedyosmum racemosum, which are plant species known to possess compounds with cytotoxic activities. Plant extracts were screened for growth inhibitory activity, and then a thin-layer chromatography bioautography assay was conducted. This located the major antileukemic compounds 1, 2, 4, and 5 in the extracts. Once the active compounds were located, they were extracted and purified, and their structures were determined. The growth inhibitory activity of the purified compounds showed a significant correlation with their antileukemic activity. The proposed approach is rapid, inexpensive, and can easily be implemented in areas of the world with high biodiversity but with less access to advanced facilities and biological assays.", "1.

The method was used to correctly identify compound 1 as the major antileukemic compound in plant extracts, and it was also established that both the plant inhibitory activity and the antileukemic activity were correlated with the amount of compound 1 in the extracts. The method was applied to Gynoxys verrucosa, Picradeniopsis oppositifolia, and Hedyosmum racemosum, and in every case, the plant growth inhibitory activity of the extracts correlated with their antileukemic activity.

Camptothecin selectively caused the inhibition of young developing vascular tissues of the axillary buds of Nicotiana tabacum L. Camptothecin inhibited the sprouting of potatoes by interfering with cell division in the meristem [79]. Early reports showed this using a partially purified enzyme from barley seeds, and strong inhibition of the relaxation of supercoiled pBR322 DNA by the barley DNA enzyme was observed with camptothecin [79]. Later work showed that plants contained a conserved Topo1, and camptothecin-producing plants, including Camptotheca acuminata, Ophiorrhiza pumila, and Ophiorrhiza liukiuensis, had point mutations in Topo1 that conferred resistance to autotoxicity [80]..", "Homoharringtonine Homoharringtonine was used for tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
