["Abstract", "Understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms is central to the development of anti\u2010infective therapies and genomics\u2010based drug discovery. Yet, many knowledge gaps remain regarding the resistance strategies employed against novel types of antibiotics from less\u2010explored producers such as anaerobic bacteria, among them the Clostridia. Through the use of genome editing and functional assays, we found that CtaZ confers self\u2010resistance against the copper chelator and gyrase inhibitor closthioamide (CTA) in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Bioinformatics, biochemical analyses, and X\u2010ray crystallography revealed CtaZ as a founding member of a new group of GyrI\u2010like proteins. CtaZ is unique in binding a polythioamide scaffold in a ligand\u2010optimized hydrophobic pocket, thereby confining CTA. By genome mining using CtaZ as a handle, we discovered previously overlooked homologs encoded by diverse members of the phylum Firmicutes, including many pathogens. In addition to characterizing both a new role for a GyrI\u2010like domain in self\u2010resistance and unprecedented thioamide binding, this work aids in uncovering related drug\u2010resistance mechanisms.", "A central contributor to the self\u2010resistance of an anaerobic antibiotic producer is identified. CtaZ, a new member of the GyrI\u2010like superfamily, confines the gyrase inhibitor closthioamide in a ligand\u2010optimized pocket. Genome mining uncovered CtaZ homologs encoded in the genomes of diverse bacteria, including numerous pathogens.", "F. Gude, E. M. Molloy, T. Horch, M. Dell, K. L. Dunbar, J. Krabbe, M. Groll, C.

The susceptibility of the three stains to exogenous CTA was determined by the agar diffusion method (Figure\u20052C).\n[23]\n Briefly, CTA solutions of differing concentrations were applied to paper discs on the surface of agar plates seeded with the test strains. CTA diffusion into the medium suppressed growth in the vicinity of the discs, resulting in measurable zones that increased in size with increasing CTA concentration. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were calculated by analyzing the inhibition data using the dissipative model of antibiotic diffusion (Figure\u2005S4).\n[24]\n We found that the double mutant (R. cellulolyticum \u0394ctaA \u0394ctaZ pMTL\u00d8) is 35\u2010fold more sensitive to CTA than R. cellulolyticum \u0394ctaA pMTL\u00d8 (Figure\u20052C). This CTA\u2010sensitive phenotype could be partially complemented by the provision of a plasmid\u2010borne copy of ctaZ, as shown by the intermediate MIC of R.\u00a0cellulolyticum \u0394ctaA \u0394ctaZ pMTL\u2010ctaZ (Figure\u20052C). The incomplete restoration of CTA resistance by trans expression of ctaZ can conceivably be explained by i) insufficient ctaZ expression, for example due to inadequate plasmid copy number or a weaker promoter compared to that in the CTA BGC, and/or ii) the separation of ctaZ from native control disrupting the tightly regulated timing of expression typically observed for self\u2010resistance genes.\n[4]\n Nevertheless, the sensitivity of the ctaZ\u2010deficient strain to CTA and its phenotypic complementation supports the proposal that R.\u00a0cellulolyticum employs the GyrI\u2010like protein CtaZ in self\u2010resistance to CTA.", "In light of our characterization of CtaZ as a self\u2010resistance\u2010conferring GyrI\u2010like protein, we were curious as to how CtaZ endows R. cellulolyticum with CTA resistance. The other known self\u2010resistance\u2010conferring GyrI\u2010like proteins, YtkR7 and C10R6, inactivate the products of their cognate BGCs by hydrolysis.\n[10c]\n We reasoned that a sequence comparison with these enzymes could shed light on the manner of self\u2010resistance imparted by CtaZ. Therefore, we created a sequence alignment and ascertained that CtaZ lacks the active site glutamate essential for hydrolytic activity of YtkR7 and C10R6 (M99, Figure\u20053A).\n[10c]\n Additionally, we recognized that another glutamate residue (E123), which is assumed to be crucial for binding of diverse ligands in GyrI\u2010like proteins,[\n10a\n, \n25\n] is conserved in CtaZ. This bioinformatic analysis indicates that CtaZ potentially binds CTA, but it likely does not hydrolyze the antibiotic.", "In light of our characterization of CtaZ as a self\u2010resistance\u2010conferring GyrI\u2010like protein, we were curious as to how CtaZ endows R. cellulolyticum with CTA resistance.

For the MDR transcriptional regulators BmrR\n[27]\n and EcmrR\n[26a]\n and the hydrolase Lin2189,\n[10c]\n ligands are bound to one of three discrete binding sites distributed along the binding pocket (Figure\u2005S8), whereas CTA spans nearly the entire length of the binding groove with a contact area of 1034\u2005\u00c52 (Figure\u20054B). Therefore, the binding mode invoked by CtaZ to capture its ligand differs from that of other GyrI\u2010like proteins. ii) CTA orientates lengthwise and rotated within the CtaZ binding groove, which is drastically different from the observed helical conformation of a CTA surrogate in complex with CuI (Figure\u20054E).\n[16]\n From these contrasting conformations, we assume that CTA cannot complex CuI while bound to CtaZ. In conclusion, the collected crystal structures not only confirm that CtaZ is a binding protein of CTA, but also reveal a novel binding mode between a self\u2010resistance\u2010mediating GyrI\u2010like protein and its natural ligand.", "Inspired by our designation of CtaZ as a self\u2010resistance\u2010conferring binding protein, we aimed to gain insight into the distribution of similar proteins in the GyrI\u2010like superfamily. To obtain an overview of the superfamily, we generated a sequence similarity network (SSN) based on members of the GyrI\u2010like protein superfamily (PF06445; 39345 sequences) and homologs of CtaZ (Figure\u20055A and Figure\u2005S9).\n[28]\n We used UniProt\n[29]\n to construct the SSN because it is a resource for well\u2010annotated and classified protein sequences and is integrated with the EFI\u2010EST web tool. Collapsing proteins with \u226550\u2009% sequence identity over 80\u2009% of the sequence length into a single node resulted in a network composed of 4318 nodes. The superfamily clusters into 91 groups containing at least three nodes (covering 2773 nodes), with the remaining 1545 nodes being organized as pairs or singles. The hydrolase proteins cluster together in a large group, whereas the inhibitory (GyrI) and binding proteins (BmrR, Rob), including CtaZ, form separate individual groups. The groups reflect the diversity of cellular functions performed by members of the GyrI\u2010like protein superfamily, which until now has comprised transcriptional regulation,[\n12b\n, \n30\n] hydrolysis\n[10c]\n and gyrase inhibition.\n[21]\n CtaZ and its homologs form a group of previously undescribed proteins in the superfamily, alongside numerous uncharacterized groups (Figure\u2005S9). Overall, the SSN illustrates that the GyrI\u2010like superfamily is far more complex than previously appreciated. Similar functional complexity is observed in other large and diverse protein families with a conserved structural motif but various cellular activities, such as the AAA+ protein family.\n[31]\n Therefore, with the identification of the CtaZ group we contribute to a better understanding of the cellular functions performed by members of the GyrI\u2010like protein superfamily and lay the foundation for deciphering the cryptic functions of the remaining uncharacterized groups.", "Inspired by our designation of CtaZ as a self\u2010resistance\u2010conferring binding protein, we aimed to gain insight into the distribution of similar proteins in the GyrI\u2010like superfamily.

To this end, BLASTp was used to identify 200 homologs of CtaZ in GenBank\n[18]\n sharing minimum 44\u2009% sequence identity. We chose the GenBank database instead of UniProt because it contains a larger number of sequences and therefore provides a more accurate picture of the available data.
