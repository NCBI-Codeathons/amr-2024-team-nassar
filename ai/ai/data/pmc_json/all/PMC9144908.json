["These authors contributed equally to this work.", "Chrysomycin A is one of the most promising therapeutic candidates for treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. By hybridizing next-step generation (Illumina) and third-generation (PacBio) sequencing technologies, a high-quality chromosome-level genome together with a plasmid was firstly assembled for chrysomycin A-producing marine strain 891. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences revealed that this strain unambiguously belonged to the genus Streptomyces, and its genomic features and functional genes were comprehensively analyzed and annotated. AntiSMASH analysis of this strain unveiled one key biosynthetic gene cluster, T2PKS, responsible for the biosynthesis of chrysomycin, the biosynthesis pathway of which was putatively proposed. These findings definitely shed light on further investigation for construction of a robust industrial strain with high-yield chrysomycin A production using genetic engineering techniques and combinatorial biology approaches.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Terrestrial and marine Streptomyces strains play an important role in new drug discovery and development since they harbor a huge number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to make a diverse array of bioactive substances with therapeutic potential [1,2]. Streptomyces bacteria are known to produce numerous natural products, most of which are clinically useful compounds with antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, immunosuppressive, and other properties. It is well known that daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic derived from the organism Streptomyces roseosporus [3], rapamycin is used as immunosuppressive metabolite from actinomycete species [4], and avermectins are a series of drugs and pesticides from Streptomyces avermitilis [5]. However, the misuse and overuse of existing antibiotics in human medical practice is liable to cause seriously antimicrobial resistance, which has emerged as one of the leading public health threats around the world [6]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to constantly search for new drug candidates to alleviate this deteriorative tendency. In the post-genomic era, the accumulation of genomic and transcriptomic information is accelerating and has revealed that the metabolic capacity of virtually all organisms is vastly underappreciated. Genome mining is one of the effective strategies to increase the discovery rate and facilitate the characterization of novel compounds and their biosynthetic pathways [7].", "Terrestrial and marine Streptomyces strains play an important role in new drug discovery and development since they harbor a huge number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to make a diverse array of bioactive substances with therapeutic potential [1,2].

CitB is a member of the two-component regulatory system CitA/CitB, which is required for expression of citrate-specific fermentation genes. Phosphorylated CitB binds to two sites in the citS\u2013citC intergenic region, where it probably activates transcription of both genes [26]. Besides that, three unknown genes were integrated in the chry891 cluster, and premised on their conserved domains, chry891_Xa was most likely emrB, encoding a DHA2 family efflux MFS (major facilitator superfamily) transporter permease subunit. As the largest family of transporters, the MFS is a typical type of multidrug resistance efflux pump, associated closely with antibiotic resistance and taking part in several important processes of bacterial cell physiology, including cell to cell communication, and increasing the virulence potential of several bacterial pathogens [27]. Chry891_Xb and chry891_Xc were predicted to encode 4\u2032-phosphopantetheinyl transferase superfamily protein and FAD-dependent monooxygenase, which are important co-factors of secondary metabolite biosynthesis catalytic enzymes. Compared to chry cluster (FN565166.1), chry891 cluster retrenched at least seven genes involved in regulation or resistance and enlarged three candidates for regulatory or co-factors, which could further promote chrysomycin biosynthesis. In addition, the gene assemblies in charge of the PK scaffold and sugar moiety nearly swapped positions, which demonstrated the plasticity of horizontal gene transfer in type II PKS.", "3. Conclusions", "3. Conclusions", "A high-quality chromosome-level genome and a plasmid were first de novo assembled for chrysomycin A-producing marine strain 891 by a combination of next-step generation (Illumina) and third-generation (PacBio) sequencing technologies. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences revealed that this strain was undoubtedly classified into the Streptomyces genus. Since the function of bacterial defense to self-toxicity is intimately linked to prophages, genomic islands, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance genes, the abundance of the corresponding genes in strain 891 should significantly contribute to chrysomycin production capability in vivo without self-toxicity, as it is a high-yielding strain [28,29,30]. AntiSMASH analysis of this strain resulted in the discovery of one key BGC T2PKS responsible for the biosynthesis of chrysomycin, and its biosynthesis pathway was putatively proposed. These findings may pave the way for the full development of strain 891 to construct a robust strain with high-yield chrysomycin A production using genetic engineering techniques and combinatorial biology approaches.", "A high-quality chromosome-level genome and a plasmid were first de novo assembled for chrysomycin A-producing marine strain 891 by a combination of next-step generation (Illumina) and third-generation (PacBio) sequencing technologies.
