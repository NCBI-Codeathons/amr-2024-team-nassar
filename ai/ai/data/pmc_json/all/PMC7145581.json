["Abstract", "DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by the highly genotoxic agent azinomycin B (AZB) can cause severe perturbation of DNA structure and even cell death. However, Streptomyces sahachiroi, the strain that produces AZB, seems almost impervious to this danger because of its diverse and distinctive self-protection machineries. Here, we report the identification of a novel endonuclease-like gene aziN that contributes to drug self-protection in S. sahachiroi. AziN expression conferred AZB resistance on native and heterologous host strains. The specific binding reaction between AziN and AZB was also verified in accordance with its homology to drug binding proteins, but no drug sequestering and deactivating effects could be detected. Intriguingly, due to the high affinity with the drug, AziN was discovered to exhibit specific recognition and binding capacity with AZB-mediated ICL structures, further inducing DNA strand breakage. Subsequent in vitro assays demonstrated the structure-specific endonuclease activity of AziN, which cuts both damaged strands at specific sites around AZB-ICLs. Unravelling the nuclease activity of AziN provides a good entrance point to illuminate the complex mechanisms of AZB-ICL repair.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly cytotoxic lesions induced by endogenous and environmental genotoxic agents that covalently tether two bases on opposite strands of the DNA double helix (1,2). This kind of lesion seriously impairs DNA replication and transcription by blocking DNA strand separation, resulting in chromosomal mutations, rearrangements, instability, and even cell death (3). Rapidly dividing cells, such as tumour cells, are hypersensitive to ICL damage, which has led to the extensive clinical application of many well-known ICL inducers in cancer treatment (4,5). Unlike the repair of simple DNA damage, a large number of proteins responsible for multiple specialized DNA repair mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair (NER), homologous recombination, translesion synthesis, mismatch repair and base excision repair (BER), can all be recruited to repair ICLs (3,6). Different ICL repair proteins are involved depending on the structure of the ICL, the cell cycle phase and the biological species. New factors implicated in ICL repair continued to be discovered with sustained advances in the research of these complex mechanisms in recent years.", "DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly cytotoxic lesions induced by endogenous and environmental genotoxic agents that covalently tether two bases on opposite strands of the DNA double helix (1,2).

However, ICL agent-producing microorganisms can easily mitigate the danger by employing diverse self-protection machineries. For instance, the clinical anticancer drug mitomycin C (MMC) producer, Streptomyces lavendulae, is known to be protected by the encoded products of three genes, mcrA, mrd\u00a0and mct, via reoxidation of the active reduced MMC, retention/sequestration of the native prodrug, and drug efflux, respectively (7\u20139). The drug binding protein BlmA and the N-acetyltransferase BlmB confer resistance to bleomycin in Streptomyces verticillus, the bleomycin-producing strain, through drug sequestration and inactivation (10).

In addition, the intensity of the mono-adduct band was almost untouched by AziN, implying that the protein incised ICL DNA rather than the mono-alkylation product.", "When FAM dye was labelled at the 3\u2032 end of the reverse strand of GCC3, both mono-adducts and ICL DNA were visibly displayed in lane 2 of Figure 4C. After AziN was added to the mixture, the migration band of ICL DNA disappeared, and a unique shift band with mobility between the mono-adducts and ICL DNA was generated (lanes 4 and 5).

When FAM dye was labeled at the 3\u2032 end of the forward strand (GCC6-1), a smaller band (fragment I) than native DNA was observed in both denatured and native PAGE (Figure 5C and\u00a0D), while a larger band (fragment II) than mono-adduct DNA was traced in the cleavage products of the ICL DNA with a 3\u2032-end-FAM label on the reverse strand (GCC6-2). Two cleavage products (fragments I and II) were detected simultaneously when both strands of GCC6-3 were 3\u2032-end-FAM labelled (Figure 5F and\u00a0G). The mobility of fragment I was identical to that of the DNA marker M4 (18-nt-FAM/16-nt) in denatured PAGE (Figure 5C and\u00a0F), while it was slightly higher than that of M4 in native PAGE (Figure 5D and\u00a0G). It is evident that AziN could cut both strands of ICL DNA, and the cleavage site on the reverse strand should be in the 5\u2032 flanking region of the crosslinking site. For precise localization of the cleavage sites, both ends of one DNA strand (GCC6-4 labelled on the forward strand and GCC6-5 labeled on the reverse strand) were labelled with 5\u2032-end-TAMRA and 3\u2032-end-FAM simultaneously. In addition to the large band of fragment II, a small band of 18-nt-FAM, regarded as the forward sequence of fragment I (lane 4 in Figure 5H), and a small band of 11-nt-TAMRA, regarded as the reverse sequence of fragment I (lane 4 in Figure 5I), were detected in the cleavage assay of crosslinked GCC6-4 and GCC6-5, respectively. The cleavage site on the reverse strand is supposed to be between the fifth and sixth nucleotides near the 5\u2032 end of the cross-linking site. Thus, fragment II is most likely the other half of the cleavage products, which still contain crosslinking structures after a double stranded break (Figure 5B). Due to its high affinity with the drug, AziN can specifically recognize and bind the AZB-ICL DNA. Moreover, it can further lead to hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds adjacent to the crosslinked structure on both strands.", "To verify the above results and obtain a more comprehensive analysis of the AziN cleavage mode, a longer 29-bp oligodeoxynucleotide duplex (GCC6, Supplementary Table S3) was 3\u2032-end-FAM labeled on the forward strand (GCC6-1), reverse strand (GCC6-2), and both strands (GCC6-3).

BLASTP analysis showed that AziN has homology and similarity with many unidentified members of the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme superfamily, but no putative conserved domains have been detected. In the sequence analysis of the Pfam database, AziN was classified as a member of the Glyoxalase_6 (PF18029) family of proteins due to the presence of a glyoxalase-like domain. This family of proteins contains a diverse set of domains related to the glyoxalase domain, and the specifics of their structure and function are uncertain. There are a few antibiotic resistance proteins in this superfamily, such as MRD, the bleomycin resistance proteins (Blms) and the fosfomycin resistance proteins (FosA/FosB/FosX) (27). Through either sequestration or inactivation, drug activities are prevented by these known resistance proteins (38\u201340). Unlike them, the specific binding of AziN with AZB had no influence on the antibacterial and crosslinking activities of the drug, suggesting the particular function of AziN. Although the interaction of AziN with Cu2+ was detected, the drug binding ability and the cleavage activity of AziN are both independent of metal ions (Supplementary Figure S4, S5 and S7). We suggest that AziN descended from an ancient metalloenzyme, and its catalytic activity changed after a natural evolutionary process while preserving metal-ion-binding capability, as previously reported as a possible explanation for the functional switching of MRD (41).", "In this study, another new determinant of AZB resistance, aziN, was discovered in the vicinity of the essential AZB resistance gene orf1/alkZ through gene deletion and heterologous expression experiments.

No chemical modification of AZB was found in the interaction of AziR and the drug, but regrettably, the potential drug sequestration effect of canonical binding proteins has not been tested. Except for aziR, the other three resistance determinants, aziE, alkZ and aziN, are all located within the AZB biosynthetic gene cluster and associated with drug production. Both alkZ and aziN can specifically recognize and excise AZB-ICL DNA. The DNA glycosylase AlkZ catalyses the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of the alkylated nucleobase to repair ICLs by triggering a BER-like pathway (22), while AziN induces hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds around ICL sites. Without conserved DNA binding domains, the interaction of AziN with ICL DNA is mediated by the drug. AziN has selectivity and specificity for AZB\u2013ICL DNA, a kind of specific DNA structure, rather than for a DNA sequence, behaving as a structure-specific endonuclease. This kind of endonuclease usually resolves specific DNA secondary structures such as single-stranded flaps, stem-loops, Holliday junctions and DNA adducts that arise during DNA damage repair, DNA recombination, DNA replication and transcription stress processes (44). ICL repair also relies on structure-specific endonucleases to cut DNA strands at lesion sites (45\u201347). Despite the lack of similarity to known endonucleases, the structure-specific endonuclease activity of AziN to cut the damaged strands was verified by an in vitro assay in this study. The repair of ICLs is a complex, multi-step process requiring the cooperation of many DNA repair proteins (1,3). Our research has shown that the protein AziN is involved in the damage recognition and incision steps of the ICL repair process, most likely in cooperation and coordination with other nucleases and regulation factors. The resulting DNA gap is generally filled by downstream translesion synthesis and homologous recombination before the remnant ICL structure is completely removed by NER (Figure 5J).
