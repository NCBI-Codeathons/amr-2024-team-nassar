["Abstract", "Bacteria use various strategies to become antibiotic resistant. The molecular details of these strategies are not fully understood. We can increase our understanding by investigating the same strategies found in antibiotic\u2010producing bacteria. In this work, we characterize the self\u2010resistance protein Ecm16 encoded by echinomycin\u2010producing bacteria. Ecm16 is a structural homolog of the nucleotide excision repair protein UvrA. Expression of ecm16 in the heterologous system Escherichia coli was sufficient to render resistance against echinomycin. Ecm16 binds DNA (double\u2010stranded and single\u2010stranded) using a nucleotide\u2010independent binding mode. Ecm16\u2019s binding affinity for DNA increased by 1.7\u2010fold when the DNA is intercalated with echinomycin. Ecm16 can render resistance against echinomycin toxicity independently of the nucleotide excision repair system. Similar to UvrA, Ecm16 has ATPase activity, and this activity is essential for Ecm16\u2019s ability to render echinomycin resistance. Notably, UvrA and Ecm16 were unable to complement each other's function. Together, our findings identify new mechanistic details of how a refurbished DNA repair protein Ecm16 can specifically render resistance to the DNA intercalator echinomycin.", "How do drug\u2010producer bacteria protect themselves from the toxicity of those drugs? We show that bacteria can make proteins such as Ecm16 is quite similar to a conserved DNA\u2010intercalator echinomycin.

One such antibiotic produced by Streptomyces is echinomycin, the first identified DNA bisintercalator (Waring,\u00a01992). DNA intercalators bind reversibly to the DNA double helix in a sequence independent manner by inserting one or more planar, fused aromatic ring groups in between adjacent base pairs (Fletcher & Fox,\u00a01996). Echinomycin, a member of the quinomycin family of antibiotics, contains two quinoxaline chromophores attached to a cyclic octadepsipeptide (Chen & Patel,\u00a01995; Dawson et al.,\u00a02007; Dell et al.,\u00a01975) (Figure\u00a01a). The quinoxaline chromophores intercalate between DNA bases pairs, with preference for CpG sites, while the depsipeptide core binds to the DNA minor groove (Dawson et al.,\u00a02007; Van Dyke & Dervan,\u00a01984). Structural studies show that binding of echinomycin leads to DNA unwinding by ~20\u00b0, (Wu et al.,\u00a02018). Echinomycin bound to DNA has been shown to inhibit transcription in bacteria and chromatin condensation and DNA replication in eukaryotes, ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest (Fok & Waring,\u00a01972; Krasinska & Fisher,\u00a02009; May et al.,\u00a02004; Sato et al.,\u00a01967; Ward et al.,\u00a01965; Waring & Makoff,\u00a01974).

The natively echinomycin\u2010sensitive E. coli cells were transformed with a low\u2010copy vector encoding ecm16 under the arabinose inducible promoter [p(ecm16)]. In the absence of echinomycin, E. coli cells with vector\u2010control\u2010only (VCO) reached saturation (OD600nm\u2009~\u20091.0) within a 6\u00a0h growth period (Figure\u00a01b). The same VCO cells grown in the presence of 1\u2009\u03bcM echinomycin only reached ~0.35 OD600nm within the same 6\u00a0h period. Almost no detectable growth was observed for VCO cells at echinomycin concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM or higher. In contrast, E. coli cells expressing ecm16 reached equivalent maximal densities when grown in the presence or in the absence of supplemented echinomycin. Using growth curve analyses, we determined the effect of ecm16 expression on bacterial doubling time (Figure\u00a0S1). In the absence of echinomycin, E. coli with or without the expression of ecm16 were able to double every ~0.54\u2009h under our growth conditions. However, in the presence of echinomycin, the doubling time of VCO cells increased nearly 4\u2010fold at the highest concentration used in this study. Remarkably, cells expressing ecm16 were able to maintain their normal doubling time up to levels of 20\u2009\u03bcM echinomycin. Furthermore, we confirmed that Ecm16 renders resistance against echinomycin using survival assays under titrated levels of echinomycin (Figure\u00a01c).

To provide this evidence and characterize Ecm16, we used E. coli K\u201012 cells as a heterologous host system to express ecm16. The natively echinomycin\u2010sensitive E. coli cells were transformed with a low\u2010copy vector encoding ecm16 under the arabinose inducible promoter [p(ecm16)]. In the absence of echinomycin, E. coli cells with vector\u2010control\u2010only (VCO) reached saturation (OD600nm\u2009~\u20091.0) within a 6\u00a0h growth period (Figure\u00a01b). The same VCO cells grown in the presence of 1\u2009\u03bcM echinomycin only reached ~0.35 OD600nm within the same 6\u00a0h period. Almost no detectable growth was observed for VCO cells at echinomycin concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM or higher. In contrast, E. coli cells expressing ecm16 reached equivalent maximal densities when grown in the presence or in the absence of supplemented echinomycin. Using growth curve analyses, we determined the effect of ecm16 expression on bacterial doubling time (Figure\u00a0S1). In the absence of echinomycin, E. coli with or without the expression of ecm16 were able to double every ~0.54\u2009h under our growth conditions. However, in the presence of echinomycin, the doubling time of VCO cells increased nearly 4\u2010fold at the highest concentration used in this study.

To determine whether Ecm16 can prevent cellular filamentation, we analyzed the cell length of E. coli after exposure to echinomycin. The mean cell length of E. coli was determined to be ~2\u00a0\u03bcm when grown in the absence of echinomycin. Exposure to echinomycin resulted in cells with a broad cell length distribution (Figure\u00a02a). We observed that the expression of ecm16 alone in the absence of echinomycin resulted in a\u2009~15% increase in mean cell length compared to the VCO. However, when echinomycin was supplemented to cells expressing ecm16, cell length was not altered compared to the no echinomycin control treatment. To further characterize the potential mechanism involved in the filamentation observed in cells exposed to echinomycin, we analyzed the cell length of SOS mutant strains. Upon DNA damage, the SOS response is triggered to simultaneously accomplish at least two goals: repair the damage and halt cytokinesis while DNA repair is underway.

For our analyses, we used two E. coli strains with knockouts of genes encoding these two SOS regulators: recA and sulA (Keio Collection) (Baba et al.,\u00a02006).

Hydrolysis rate of ATP by Ecm16 was measured in a 96\u2010well plate using an enzyme\u2010coupled assay where the substrate 2\u2010amino\u20106\u2010mercapto\u20107\u2010methylpurine riboside (MESG) is enzymatically converted to ribose 1\u2010phosphate and 2\u2010amino\u20106\u2010mercapto\u20107\u2010methylpurine by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) in the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi). This enzymatic conversion of MESG results in a spectrophotometric shift in maximum absorbance of 360\u2009nm for the product formed. The reaction mixture (100\u2009\u03bcl) contained 50\u2009mM HEPES pH\u00a07.5, 50\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5\u00a0mg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol, 10\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM ATP, 0.2\u2009mM MESG, 1\u00d7 reaction buffer (50\u2009mM tris HCl pH\u00a07.5, 10\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.1\u2009mM sodium azide), 1\u00a0U/ml PNP and/or 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM Ecm16 in presence of DNA substrates. A 32\u2010mer palindromic DNA oligonucleotide containing single echinomycin binding site was used as DNA substrate (Table S1). DNA\u2010echinomycin complex was allowed to form by incubating 1.0: 1.1 molar ratio of DNA: echinomycin for 15\u2009min. The rate of hydrolysis was calculated from the linear change in absorbance at 360\u2009nm and 22\u00b0C for 60\u2009min. The absorbance at 360\u2009nm were corrected for background absorbance and the nanomoles of inorganic phosphate released after ATP hydrolysis of Ecm16 were calculated using KH2PO4 as the source for the inorganic phosphate. The effect of DNA on ATP hydrolysis of Ecm16 was studied by adding 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM 32\u2010mer dsDNA or Ech\u2010dsDNA substrate in the assay mixture.
