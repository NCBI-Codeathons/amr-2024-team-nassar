["Plants usually produce defence metabolites in non-active forms to minimize the risk of harm to themselves and spatiotemporally activate these defence metabolites upon pathogen attack. This so-called two-component system plays a decisive role in the chemical defence of various plants. Here, we discovered that Panax notoginseng, a valuable medicinal plant, has evolved a two-component chemical defence system composed of a chloroplast-localized \u03b2-glucosidase, denominated PnGH1, and its substrates 20(S)-protopanaxadiol ginsenosides. The \u03b2-glucosidase and its substrates are spatially separated in cells under physiological conditions, and ginsenoside hydrolysis is therefore activated only upon chloroplast disruption, which is caused by the induced exoenzymes of pathogenic fungi upon exposure to plant leaves. This activation of PnGH1-mediated hydrolysis results in the production of a series of less-polar ginsenosides by selective hydrolysis of an outer glucose at the C-3 site, with a broader spectrum and more potent antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo than the precursor molecules. Furthermore, such \u03b2-glucosidase-mediated hydrolysis upon fungal infection was also found in the congeneric species P. quinquefolium and P. ginseng. Our findings reveal a two-component chemical defence system in Panax species and offer insights for developing botanical pesticides for disease management in Panax species.", "In this work, the authors discovered that Panax species, the valuable medicinal plants, have evolved a two-component chemical defence system comprising a chloroplast-localized \u03b2-glucosidase and 20(S)-protopanaxadiol ginsenosides.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "In nature, plants deploy an enormous array of secondary metabolites to defend against pathogens and herbivores1. These defensive metabolites can be classified into two broad categories: constitutive defence metabolites (phytoanticipins), which act directly on pathogens or herbivores, and inducible defence compounds (phytoalexins), which are specifically produced in response to aggressors2. Compared with constitutive defence, inducible defence is more energetically economical and plays an essential role in plant chemical defence3. The specialized metabolites in inducible defence are usually toxic to the plant, pathogens, or herbivores. Accordingly, plants have evolved two-component chemical defence systems that prevent autotoxicity to help balance plant growth and defence needs1. For instance, defence compounds are often stored in a non-active glycosylated form1,4. In addition to protecting plants from autotoxicity, glycosylation increases the solubility of defence compounds, thereby facilitating their storage, typically in vacuoles5. Upon plant cell damage caused by herbivory or pathogen invasion, glycosylated compounds can be selectively hydrolyzed at glycosidic linkages, yielding toxic defence compounds6. This hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by \u03b2-glycosidase, which is spatially separated from its substrates under physiological conditions but encounters them upon tissue damage. Thus, this two-component chemical defence system comprises glycosylated defence compounds and corresponding \u03b2-glycosidases and provides an immediate chemical response against herbivores or pathogens7. Although \u03b2-glycosidases have been shown to play a decisive role in the chemical defence of various plants, these enzymes have not yet been reported in Panax species.", "In nature, plants deploy an enormous array of secondary metabolites to defend against pathogens and herbivores1.

The cultivation of P. notoginseng is primarily restricted to southern China; the roots of this species are highly valued for their use in the prevention and treatment of diverse hematological diseases and ischemic cardiovascular diseases10\u201312. P. notoginseng is highly sensitive to sunlight and requires shady, warm, damp environments for growth13. These stringent requirements for cultivation and long harvest cycles increase the vulnerability of the plant to pathogen infection. Over 20 foliar and root diseases that affect P. notoginseng growth have been identified, including round spots caused by Mycocentrospora acerina, black spots caused by Alternaria panax, and rotten roots caused by Fusarium oxysporum.

The core structure of PnGH1 contained eight parallel \u03b2-strands surrounded by eight helices forming the (\u03b2/\u03b1)8 barrel fold as a substrate-binding pocket (Fig.\u00a03c). In addition, several salt bridges between Asp/Glu residues and Lys/Arg residues were observed, which could make great contributions to the temperature tolerance of PnGH1 by stabilizing the protein structure. Further in silico docking and simulation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018) of Rg3 with PnGH1 revealed that the \u03b2-(1,2)-linked glycosidic bond at C-3 was positioned deep within the catalytic pocket, while the other side of the substrate-binding pocket exhibited a wide, open entrance (Fig.\u00a03d), making it possible for the protein to accommodate various PPD-type ginsenosides with different substituents at C-20. PnGH1 retained the glutamic acid-containing catalytic motifs TFN(E/D)P and (V/Y)ITENG, which are highly conserved in other known GH1 \u03b2-glucosidases (Supplementary Fig.\u00a019)20. Comprehensive analysis of the amino acid residues lining the catalytic pocket (Fig.\u00a03e) revealed that the critical residues E232 in the TFNE/DP motif and E425 in the (V/Y)ITENG motif were indeed situated on opposite sides of the \u03b2-(1,2)-linked glycosidic bond, indicating a distance of 3.5\u2009\u00c5 between the OE2 atom of E425 (Onucleophile) and the anomeric carbon (Celectrophile) and 3.3\u2009\u00c5 between the OE2 atom of E232 and the oxygen atom of the leaving sugar group (Oleaving). The measured Onucleophile\u2013Celectrophile\u2013Oleaving angle was 173\u00b0 (Fig.\u00a03e). In addition, the distance between E232 and E425 was 5.0\u2009\u00c5 (Fig.\u00a03d), suggesting that PnGH1 is a retaining glucosidase rather than an inverting enzyme, in which the distance between these two catalytic residues would be ~10.0\u2009\u00c523. The above results suggest that PnGH1 employs the well-studied acid-catalytic retaining mechanism23 requiring the involvement of two critical carboxylate residues, E232 and E425 (Fig.\u00a03f). Accordingly, the mutagenesis of E232 and E425 to alanine deactivated the hydrolysis activity of PnGH1. In contrast, when E232 was replaced with aspartic acid, the enzyme activity could be effectively recovered (Fig.\u00a03g). This observation further indicated the crucial role of carboxylate residues in the hydrolysis process. Docking results showed that several other residues, in addition to E232 and E425, were located in the catalytic pocket of PnGH1 and interacted with the substrate (Fig.\u00a03e, Supplementary Table\u00a02) through hydrogen-bond interactions (including Q90, H186, N231, K398, E425, E493, and Y503) and hydrophobic interactions (Y234).

In our study, the first indication that PPD-type ginsenosides have defensive properties against fungal infection was that ginsenoside hydrolysis was localized to the decayed tissue of PNLs with round spot disease. These findings were also confirmed in M. acerina-inoculated PNLs in the greenhouse. Nevertheless, a small quantity of hydrolysis products was detected in the leaves of non-infected plants and healthy tissue in the same and neighboring leaves, indicating that other unidentified factors or stresses might also cause mild ginsenoside hydrolysis in healthy PNLs under highly complex open-field conditions. However, upon fungal infection, intact ginsenosides are largely hydrolyzed in the decayed tissue of the PNLs. We further revealed that ginsenoside hydrolysis is a stress type-specific response associated with infection by pathogenic fungi, but absent in non-pathogenic fungal infection and designed abiotic stress. Dynamic chemical changes during fungal infection indicated that the molar amounts of the hydrolysis products in decayed PNLs increased dramatically, with increases ranging from 2.2-fold to 7.8-fold, suggesting that ginsenoside biosynthesis is enhanced to produce greater amounts of the hydrolysis products upon fungal infection. Fd, with the strongest antifungal activity, showed the most significant enrichment during the infection process.

Triterpene saponins exert antifungal activity by inhibiting biofilm formation and disrupting the membrane integrity by forming saponin-sterol complex, acting as plant defence compounds20,33.
