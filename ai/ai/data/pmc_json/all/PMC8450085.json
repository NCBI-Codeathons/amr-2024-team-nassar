["Abstract", "Macrolides have been effective clinical antibiotics for over 70 years. They inhibit protein biosynthesis in bacterial pathogens by narrowing the nascent protein exit tunnel in the ribosome. The macrolide class of natural products consist of a macrolactone ring linked to one or more sugar molecules. Most of the macrolides used currently are semi-synthetic erythromycin derivatives, composed of a 14- or 15-membered macrolactone ring. Rapidly emerging resistance in bacterial pathogens is among the most urgent global health challenges, which render many antibiotics ineffective, including next-generation macrolides. To address this threat and advance a longer-term plan for developing new antibiotics, we demonstrate how 16-membered macrolides overcome erythromycin resistance in clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains. By determining the structures of complexes of the large ribosomal subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans (D50S) with these 16-membered selected macrolides, and performing anti-microbial studies, we identified resistance mechanisms they may overcome. This new information provides important insights toward the rational design of therapeutics that are effective against drug resistant human pathogens.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens are ubiquitous in hospitals as well as community medical facilities. According to the CDC report the number of recalcitrant infections, owing to drug resistant bacteria, increases by 2.8M annually, as reported in (https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf, https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/p1113-antibiotic-resistant.html https://www.who.int/drugresistance/documents/surveillancereport/en/, https://www.who.int/news/item/17\u201301\u20132020-lack-of-new-antibiotics-threatens-global-efforts-to-contain-drug-resistant-infectionshttps://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/antimicrobial_resistance/docs/amr_2017_action-plan.pdf). Antibacterial agents often target essential processes of the cell, which impairs function and halts cellular metabolism and integrity (1,2). One of the main targets of antibacterial agents is the ribosome, the cellular organelle that translates the genetic code into proteins in all living cells. As it is essential for cellular viability, its inhibition leads to growth arrest or cell death. Structural analyses of bacterial ribosome particles in complex with paralyzing antibiotics shed light on their mode of action and basis of selectivity, thus elucidating clinical efficacy. These studies have revealed that clinical antibiotics target select functional sites in the ribosome, including the decoding region, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), the nascent chain exit tunnel, the inter-subunit bridges\u00a0and the tRNA accommodation corridor (3). These efforts have also illuminated diverse resistance mechanisms that have evolved in human pathogens to evade various antibiotic agents (3,4).", "Antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens are ubiquitous in hospitals as well as community medical facilities.

The macrolide chemical structure consists of a macrolactone ring of various sizes (typically 12\u201320 atoms), to which one or more sugar moieties of various types, including amino sugars, deoxy sugars, or both, are attached by an \u03b1- or \u03b2-glycosidic bond (Figure 1A) (5). Overall, macrolides inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the nascent peptide exit tunnel (NPET) in close proximity to the PTC, thus interfering with protein nascent chain progression (6). The mechanism of action of each specific macrolide is determined by the location of the sugar(s) and specific functional groups on the macrolactone ring, which affect the interactions with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) nucleotides that constitute most of the walls of the protein exit tunnel (7). Notably, whereas macrolides are efficient inhibitors of prokaryotic ribosomes, they do not bind to eukaryotic ribosomes owing to the existence of G2058 instead of the prokaryotic A2058 that forms a vital hydrogen bond between the desosamine sugar moiety C2 hydroxyl and the N1 imine of rRNA nucleotide adenosine 2058 (A2058) (Escherichia coli numbering used throughout) (8). Pikromycin, was the first macrolide discovered as a natural product in 1950 (9,10). Subsequently, additional macrolides were identified from several Streptomyces species and related actinomycetes, including erythromycin A (ery), which is the prototype for several clinically relevant antibiotics. Second generation macrolides (semi-synthetic derivatives) clarithromycin, and azithromycin (azi), are among the most widely prescribed antiinfective agents, and third generation ketolide cethromycin is clinically approved while solithromycin remains under development. Following its FDA approval, safety issues emerged with telithromycin and it was withdrawn from the US market (Figure 1). The ery-derived semisynthetic derivatives bearing a 14- or 15-membered ring core are more commonly used than other macrolide classes (Figure 1B). Tylosin, josamycin, carbomycin A, and spiramycin are 16-membered macrolide antibiotics that include a disaccharide at position C-5, with tylosin also bearing a mycinose substituent at position C-23. They are mainly used in veterinary medicine and are less studied despite their impressive antibacterial profiles and potent activity against Gram-positive and a limited range of Gram-negative organisms, similar to the 14-membered macrolides. From a molecular perspective, the 16-membered ring macrolides extend deeper in the protein exit tunnel, and their clinical advantages include better gastrointestinal tolerance, lack of drug-drug interactions, and activity against certain drug resistant bacterial strains (11). The mycinamicins (mycs) are comprised of a 16-membered macrolactone ring with O-linked sugars desosamine and mycinose located at the C-5 and C-21 positions, respectively. They were first discovered in 1980 from Micromonospora griseorubida (12), and were shown to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (SA) strains (12). The wild-type M. griseorubida strain mainly generates mycs I, II, IV and V, whereas the industrial strain has been optimized for production of myc I and II as the two major products. Mycs biosynthesis occurs by the action of seven polyketide synthase (PKS) modules, including MycAI and MycAIII that contain two modules each, whereas MycAII, MycAIV and MycAV constitute monomodules. The PKS system encompasses 37 catalytic domains for assembly of the 16-membered ring protomycinolide-IV aglycone (13). Mycs I, II, IV, and V are produced by late-stage oxidation steps from the initial macrolide myc IV. Thus, myc IV can be oxidized to a terminal product myc I (through C12\u2014C13 olefin epoxidation) or to myc V (C-14 hydroxylation). The myc V intermediate is subsequently converted to the completely oxidized myc II as the terminal pathway product resulting from a final epoxidation step (14).", "Erythromycin, the first macrolide developed as an antibacterial agent is employed clinically to treat Gram-positive and a limited number of Gram-negative bacterial infections (5).

Four distinct macrolide resistance mechanisms have been described for SA: rRNA mutational substitutions in position 2058 or 2059, modification of the target site, that is, by rRNA methylation, activation of efflux pumps that reduces cellular concentrations of the drug, and drug inactivation by enzymatic modification or cleavage. Macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins B (MLSB) share an overlapping binding site in the large ribosomal subunit (6) in which they interact with A2058. Thus, methylation or demethylation of A2058 affects the ability of these three classes of compounds to form a hydrogen bond with the above mentioned nucleotide and enables resistance against MLSB (16\u201318). Erythromycin-resistant methylase (erm) genes that trigger mono- and di-methylation of A2058 represent a common resistance mechanism. To date, over 40 known erm genes, constitutive or inducible, were identified in bacteria (19) and it has been shown that inducible MLSB (MLSBi) is associated with exposure to 14- and 15-membered ring macrolide antibiotics (20,21). The lack of a cladinose sugar at the C-3 position of the lactone ring can potentially contribute to the ability of these compounds to remain active towards bacterial pathogens that bear inducible erm genes by preventing their activation (21). Most efflux pumps that enable a macrolide resistant phenotype are compound-specific and hence affect only a small number of drugs. Currently, approximately 25 bacterial genes are known to encode antibiotic efflux pumps, each of which is highly specific to a specific set of compounds. These primarily mediate resistance against 14- and 15-membered ring macrolides rather than 16-membered ring macrolides (http://faculty.washington.edu/marilynr/) (18). Antibiotic target protection mechanisms typically involve a protein that directly interacts and blocks an antibiotic binding site to safeguard its function (22). Such blockers are the ABC-F transporters that are widespread in Gram-positive bacteria and have been shown to act towards 14-membered-ring macrolides (23). Mechanisms that involve antibiotic inactivation (as opposed to target modification or efflux) through structural degradation or modification are less common in bacterial pathogens. They are mediated by esterases that hydrolyze the macrolactone of 14- and 15-membered ring macrolides, or by a phosphotransferase that phosphorylates one of the sugar moieties (http://faculty.washington.edu/marilynr/) (18,24,25).", "A critical challenge reflects the urgent need for new antibiotics to overcome emerging resistance in human bacterial pathogens.

On the other hand, SA resistance to tylosin, which has been employed for decades as an animal health product (e.g. antibiotic and growth promotion), is primarily ermB (53). Additional known synergistically acting tylosin self-resistance genes from the producing organism Streptomyces fradiae (54), tlrA, tlrB, tlrC\u00a0and tlrD confer A2058 and G748 methylation (16). The mobilization of these genes could result in cross-over mycinamycin resistance, thus limiting its long-term clinical efficacy if tylosin is persistently used in veterinary medicine (55). Fortunately, various recent studies suggest how the potential cross-over resistance burden may be deliberately managed and reduced (56,57).", "Currently no antibiotic belonging to the 16-membered ring macrolide class has been clinically approved for human use, and thus a robust resistance mechanism has not emerged.

This was rationalized by modeling the outcome of various common resistance mechanisms on the mycs-ribosome complex structures. A2058 N6 dimethylation (58) (Figure 4D), as well as a single mutation in position A2058 may cause a steric clash between the desosamine sugar of the drug and the modified nucleotide (similar to the H50S and 16-membered ring macrolides shown in Figure 4). It has been shown that tylosin (a 16-membered ring macrolide) escapes this steric clash due to its slightly different ribosome binding orientation compared to erythromycin (59), where the C6 aldehyde appears to be located ideally to form a covalent imine bond with A2062 (Figure 4A\u2013C). The formation of this covalent bond with A2062 is unique to tylosin, carbomycin and spiramycin 16-membered lactone ring macrolides due to their size and their common C6 aldehyde moiety, which is lacking in the 14-membered macrolide antibiotics. A double mutation A2058G and A2062U resulted in a higher level of drug resistance towards 16-membered macrolides in M. smegmatis (59), which underscores the significance of the macrolide A2062 interaction. In this respect, the mycinamycins are also interacting with A2062, via a hydrogen bond, but do not escape resistance due to A2058 modifications. Nevertheless, the clinical use of 14-membered ring macrolides as a treatment against bacterial pathogens having MLSBi resistance triggers the erm genes and severely limits the use of lincosamides and streptogramins B (60). Using PCR, we identified other myc I, II\u00a0and IV-susceptible ery-resistance strains with resistance mechanisms that do not involve ermA and ermC, and further investigation is needed to determine their molecular mechanisms.", "PCR identified a single resistance mechanism that the mycs cannot overcome, namely the structural changes in position A2058 in the ribosomal NPET.
