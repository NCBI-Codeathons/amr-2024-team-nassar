However, all of them contain a 16-membered macrodiolide ring, formed by two hydroxy acids, commonly called as L (large, C1-C18) and S (small, C\u20321\u2032- C-11\u2032), with three cis-2,5-disubstituted tetrahydrofurans and adjacent alkyl-substituted chains (Fig.\u00a01). The variations of these alkyl-substituents create a chemical diversity of pamamycins. At the same time, to date, only two pamamycins are known in which the hydroxy acid L (18C) is extended by one or two additional methylene groups: homopamamycin 621A (hydroxy acid L\u201419C) and bishomopamamycin 635 (hydroxy acid L\u201420C) [23]. \u201cLight\u201d pamamycins (such as pam-607, pam-621A, etc.) are major components of the produced mixture and thus could be relatively easily isolated from the fermentation broth.

Larger pamamycins with molecular mass of 649\u00a0Da and higher, were detected but never chemically or pharmaceutically characterized because of miserable yields [33]. Due to their extraordinary bioactivities and challenging molecular structure, pamamycins have stimulated intense synthetic as well as biotechnological efforts to provide sufficient amounts and enable pharmacological studies [9, 37]. However, chemical synthesis of pamamycins is very complex and protracted due to the stereospecificity of the tetrahydrofuran rings and the adjacent stereocenters of alkyl chains [21].

During biosynthesis, two asymmetric hydroxy acids are produced, which together form the final pamamycin molecule (Fig.\u00a01).

Pamamycin 635G, with an exact mass of 635.4761\u00a0Da (Fig.\u00a05A), was obtained as a white powder (4.4\u00a0mg). It shows only five triplet methyls in addition to the two singlet N-methyl signals in its proton spectrum (Additional file 1: Tables S\u20191, S\u20192, Additional file 1: Figs. S\u20191, S\u20192). Two of them represent the methyl H-18 and methyl H-11\u2032 chain ends of the two hydroxy acid fragments (Additional file 1: Fig. S\u20193). This leaves three methyl groups, each of which is presumably attached as part of an ethyl group to the previously known stereogenic centres C-2, C-7, C-9, C-2\u2032 or C-7\u2032 (Additional file 1: Fig. S\u20195). Since all known pamamycins 635, 635A, 635F [33, 37] and bis-homo-pamamycin-635A [24] bear at least two doublet methyls, pamamycin 635G must be a new pamamycin. 2D NMR measurements support this assumption. According to the analysis of 1H-1H COSY, HSQCED, HSQC-TOCSY and HMBC (Additional file 1: Fig. S\u20194\u2013S\u20197), the three ethyl residues are found at C-2, C-9 and C-2\u2032 (Fig.\u00a05A). Thus, pamamycins 635G is the first known derivative build solely by malonate and ethylmalonate, without involvement of methylmalonate as a precursor.Fig. 5Structures of pamamycin 635G (A), pamamycin 663A (B) and homopamamycin 677A (C).
