In light of the significant potency against cancer, the biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported from many different Streptomyces strains, and the biosynthetic pathway were proposed mainly based on the in vivo feeding experiment with isotope labeled putative intermediates. Herein we report another gene cluster from Streptomyces griseovariabilis subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov responsible for the biosynthesis of echinomycin (a member of quinomycin family, also named quinomycin A) and presented in vitro evidence to corroborate the previous hypothesis on QXC biosynthesis, showing that only with the assistance of a MbtH-like protein Qui5, did the didomain NRPS protein (Qui18) perform the loading of a L-tryptophan onto its own PCP domain. Particularly, it was found that Qui5 and Qui18 subunits form a functional tetramer through size exclusion chromatography. The subsequent hydroxylation on \u03b2-carbon of the loaded L-tryptophan proved in vitro to be completed by cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylase Qui15. Importantly, only the Qui18 loaded L-tryptophan can be hydroxylated by Qui15 and the enzyme was inactive on free L-tryptophan. Additionally, the chemically synthesized (2S,3S) \u03b2-hydroxytryptophan was detected to be converted by the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase Qui17 through LC-MS, which enriched our previous knowledge that tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase nearly exclusively acted on L-tryptophan and 6-fluoro-tryptophan.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Quinomycin antibiotics are composed of the nonribosomal peptide (NRP) backbone and a pair of identical quinoxaline or 3-hydroxyquinaldic rings (Figure 1), which originates respectively from the aromatic precursor of quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QXC) and 3-hydroxyquinaldic acid (HQA) [1] (Figure 1). The two aromatic compounds are structural analogs, crucial for the anticancer potency of quinomycin, including echinomycin (quinomycin A), triostin, SW-163 and thiocoraline via the intercalation of their QXC (for echinomycin and triostin) or HQA (for SW-163 and thiocoraline) into DNA base pairs to form a sandwiching structure so that both DNA replication and transcription are inhibited, despite the difference in the insertion hotspot on DNA which are determined by the amino acid residues in the NRP backbones [2], [3], [4]. The biosynthetic gene clusters for echinomycin [5], [6] and triostin [7] indicated that the QXC and HQA biosynthesis genes have high homology among some counterparts especially in the enzymes assigned to first several steps of QXC and HQA biosynthesis pathway. In detail for the aromatic precursor biosynthesis, at first, with the help of an MbtH-like protein, L-tryptophan is loaded onto a NRPS protein which consists of both adenylation (A) and PCP (T) domain, the assistance of the MbtH-like protein in the activity of the NRPS protein in echinomycin and triostin A biosynthesis was proposed by Kenji Watanabe, yet unsubstantiated [6], [7]. A domain activates L-tryptophan by adenylation and subsequently catalyzes the formation of a thioester bond between the carbonyl group of adenylated tryptophan and the thiol group of phosphopantetheine on PCP domain. The loaded tryptophan is hydroxylated at \u03b2-carbon by a cytochrome P450 superfamily member to produce (2S,3S) \u03b2-hydroxytryptophanyl-S-PCP. The hydroxylated tryptophan is then released by a type II thioesterase to present (2S,3S) \u03b2-hydroxytryptophan. The free hydroxytryptophan undergoes a oxidative indole-ring opening mediated by a member of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase superfamily to form (2S,3R) N-formyl-\u03b2-hydroxykynurenine, which is hydrolyzed by a hydrolase to yield (2S,3R) \u03b2-hydroxykynurenine. For the QXC pathway, the subsequent reaction is an oxidative rearrangement fulfilled by a FAD-dependent oxidoreductase, giving rise to N-(2\u2032-aminophenyl)-\u03b2-hydroxyaspartic acid, the intermediate was converted to N-(2\u2032-aminophenyl)-\u03b2-ketoaspartic acid by a dehydrogenase. The ensuing three steps of decarboxylation, cyclization and oxidative aromatization reaction occur spontaneously to produce the last aromatic precursor QXC [8]. For the HQA pathway, the amino group on the \u03b1-carbon of (2S,3R) \u03b2-hydroxykynurenine is converted by an aminotransferase to form a carbonyl group, which is linked to the amino group steming from the nitrogen atom of L-tryptophan, resulting in the formation of another six-membered ring neighboring the benzyl ring, finally, it is reduced to HQA [9].", "Quinomycin antibiotics are composed of the nonribosomal peptide (NRP) backbone and a pair of identical quinoxaline or 3-hydroxyquinaldic rings (Figure 1), which originates respectively from the aromatic precursor of quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QXC) and 3-hydroxyquinaldic acid (HQA) [1] (Figure 1).

SDS-PAGE showed a little higher amount of Qui18 in the 100-fold diluted coexpression sample than the undiluted solely expressed sample (Figure S2). Through coexpression, the two proteins Qui5 and Qui18 could be copurified through Ni column affinity chromatography, since both the two genes in pJTU5906 carried His6 tag (Figure S2). It was noteworthy that the copurified product was concentrated with Millipore Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units 50 kD, meaning that proteins smaller than 50 kD would be lost through centrifugation. Although Qui5 was only about 10 kD, it could still be detected through both SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, which suggested that Qui5 might bind to Qui18, which is big enough for the retention by Millipore Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units whereby the tightly bound Qui5 could be reserved and detected together with Qui18. More direct evidence to show the binding of Qui5 to Qui18 was provided by size exclusion chromatography which showed a peak corresponding to the mass weight of around 160 kD (Figure S3), and the SDS-PAGE analysis about the fraction showed the existence of Qui5 and Qui18 at about an equal amount (data not shown), hence it can be concluded that two subunits of Qui5 and two subunits of Qui18 form a hetero-tetramer. Before doing any enzymatic study on Qui18, we must mature it by phosphopantetheinylating its PCP domain, which was realized by coexpression with sfp gene (Bacillus subtills PPTase gene expressed from pSV20) during fermentation. Both theoretical computation and ESI-QTOF-MS indicated the molecular weight of apo and holo-Qui18 was respectively 64,496 and 64,836 Da, which was a +340 mass shift consistent with 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine (4\u2032-PP) cofactor covalently attached to the conserved Ser residue of apo-Qui18. The in vivo phosphopantetheinylation efficiency was so high that the protein sample purified from pSV20 containing strain gave a peak at 16.8 min, having an ion signal of m/z at 64,836 Da and the signal of m/z at 64,496 Da was utterly undetected by ESI-QTOF-MS (data not shown). The coexpression sample of qui5 and qui18 or qui5, qui18 and sfp gave another peak at 13.3 min, having a corresponding ion signal of m/z at 10,094 Da which was assigned to Qui5, and not surprisingly, no signal of Sfp was detected since Sfp didn\u2019t carry a His6 tag. Given that the coexpression of Qui5 and Qui18 and Sfp could produce Qui18 at much higher concentration and the copurification of Qui5, Qui18 and Sfp could also guarantee the existence of mature Qui18 and Qui5, presumably in a complex form, the coexpression product of the three genes was directly used for the in vitro assay. After incubation for 2 hours, the sample in which coexpression product of Qui5 and holo-Qui18 were used with L-tryptophan added in showed a mass shift of +186, giving an ion signal of m/z at 65,022 Da (Figure 4E), which was conclusively due to the formation of a thio-ester bond between the thio group of 4\u2032-PP and the carboxyl group of L-tryptophan and a concomitant removal of water molecule, despite the mass shift to 65,022 Da, the retention time nearly stayed the same at 16.8 min, since the loaded L-tryptophan residue was too small for the original mass weight 64,836 Da to have notable effect on the retention time of Qui18. In use of the coexpression product of Qui5 and holo-Qui18 as above, yet with D-tryptophan or L-phenylalanine tested, the ion signal stayed unchanged at 64,836 Da (Figure 4C and D), demonstrating no occurrence of any amino acid loading. When holo-Qui18 was used even with the substrate L-tryptophan, the signal remained at 64,836 Da, and the supplementation of Qui5 to the holo-Qui18 turned out to make no difference at all (Figure 4B). The rationale for the failing of the holo-Qui18 supplemented with Qui5 to loading L-tryptophan might be that the in vitro condition was not suitable for the interaction of Qui5 with Qui18 and hence Qui5 was not able to assist in the loading even if the coexistence of the two protein, but there was another possibility which could trace back to the earlier stage when Qui18 was expressed in E. coli that the Qui18 couldn\u2019t fold correctly without the help of Qui5, the explanation is mainly based on the phenomenon referred to above that much more soluble Qui18 could be derived from the coexpression strain containing pJTU5906 than from the strain containing pJTU5905 for the expression of qui18 alone. It might be that Qui5 coexpression with Qui18 in vivo helped Qui18 fold correctly immediately after the translation of qui18 and simultaneously Qui5 would bind to Qui18 tightly in vivo. In sum, Qui18 recognized L-tryptophan as its substrate and its function depended on the association with Qui5. The association may take place soon after the translation of Qui18.", "During the expression and purification of related proteins, we found that much more soluble Qui18 would be acquired by coexpression of both qui5 and qui18 than by the expressing qui18 alone.

When holo-Qui18 was used even with the substrate L-tryptophan, the signal remained at 64,836 Da, and the supplementation of Qui5 to the holo-Qui18 turned out to make no difference at all (Figure 4B). The rationale for the failing of the holo-Qui18 supplemented with Qui5 to loading L-tryptophan might be that the in vitro condition was not suitable for the interaction of Qui5 with Qui18 and hence Qui5 was not able to assist in the loading even if the coexistence of the two protein, but there was another possibility which could trace back to the earlier stage when Qui18 was expressed in E. coli that the Qui18 couldn\u2019t fold correctly without the help of Qui5, the explanation is mainly based on the phenomenon referred to above that much more soluble Qui18 could be derived from the coexpression strain containing pJTU5906 than from the strain containing pJTU5905 for the expression of qui18 alone. It might be that Qui5 coexpression with Qui18 in vivo helped Qui18 fold correctly immediately after the translation of qui18 and simultaneously Qui5 would bind to Qui18 tightly in vivo. In sum, Qui18 recognized L-tryptophan as its substrate and its function depended on the association with Qui5. The association may take place soon after the translation of Qui18.", "During the expression and purification of related proteins, we found that much more soluble Qui18 would be acquired by coexpression of both qui5 and qui18 than by the expressing qui18 alone. SDS-PAGE showed a little higher amount of Qui18 in the 100-fold diluted coexpression sample than the undiluted solely expressed sample (Figure S2). Through coexpression, the two proteins Qui5 and Qui18 could be copurified through Ni column affinity chromatography, since both the two genes in pJTU5906 carried His6 tag (Figure S2). It was noteworthy that the copurified product was concentrated with Millipore Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units 50 kD, meaning that proteins smaller than 50 kD would be lost through centrifugation. Although Qui5 was only about 10 kD, it could still be detected through both SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, which suggested that Qui5 might bind to Qui18, which is big enough for the retention by Millipore Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units whereby the tightly bound Qui5 could be reserved and detected together with Qui18. More direct evidence to show the binding of Qui5 to Qui18 was provided by size exclusion chromatography which showed a peak corresponding to the mass weight of around 160 kD (Figure S3), and the SDS-PAGE analysis about the fraction showed the existence of Qui5 and Qui18 at about an equal amount (data not shown), hence it can be concluded that two subunits of Qui5 and two subunits of Qui18 form a hetero-tetramer. Before doing any enzymatic study on Qui18, we must mature it by phosphopantetheinylating its PCP domain, which was realized by coexpression with sfp gene (Bacillus subtills PPTase gene expressed from pSV20) during fermentation. Both theoretical computation and ESI-QTOF-MS indicated the molecular weight of apo and holo-Qui18 was respectively 64,496 and 64,836 Da, which was a +340 mass shift consistent with 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine (4\u2032-PP) cofactor covalently attached to the conserved Ser residue of apo-Qui18. The in vivo phosphopantetheinylation efficiency was so high that the protein sample purified from pSV20 containing strain gave a peak at 16.8 min, having an ion signal of m/z at 64,836 Da and the signal of m/z at 64,496 Da was utterly undetected by ESI-QTOF-MS (data not shown). The coexpression sample of qui5 and qui18 or qui5, qui18 and sfp gave another peak at 13.3 min, having a corresponding ion signal of m/z at 10,094 Da which was assigned to Qui5, and not surprisingly, no signal of Sfp was detected since Sfp didn\u2019t carry a His6 tag. Given that the coexpression of Qui5 and Qui18 and Sfp could produce Qui18 at much higher concentration and the copurification of Qui5, Qui18 and Sfp could also guarantee the existence of mature Qui18 and Qui5, presumably in a complex form, the coexpression product of the three genes was directly used for the in vitro assay. After incubation for 2 hours, the sample in which coexpression product of Qui5 and holo-Qui18 were used with L-tryptophan added in showed a mass shift of +186, giving an ion signal of m/z at 65,022 Da (Figure 4E), which was conclusively due to the formation of a thio-ester bond between the thio group of 4\u2032-PP and the carboxyl group of L-tryptophan and a concomitant removal of water molecule, despite the mass shift to 65,022 Da, the retention time nearly stayed the same at 16.8 min, since the loaded L-tryptophan residue was too small for the original mass weight 64,836 Da to have notable effect on the retention time of Qui18.

Qui15 was a heme-dependent protein, presenting a brownish color and had a molecular weight of about 46 kD per subunit (Figure S4). According to the previous knowledge about \u03b2-carbon hydroxylation of amino acids, the reaction could occur only if the putative substrate amino acid was loaded onto NRPS protein. Therefore, before the hydroxylation reaction, L-tryptophan loading reaction proceeded for 2 hours, and then all the necessary factors for hydroxylation were supplemented.
