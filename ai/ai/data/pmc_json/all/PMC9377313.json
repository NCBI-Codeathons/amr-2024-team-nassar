The effect of biochar on the variations in physicochemical properties, bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of compost product during co-composting of pig manure and corn straw have been investigated in this study. Compared with the control treatment (CK), biochar addition accelerated the increase in pile temperature and prolonged the high temperature period (>55\u00b0C) for 2\u00a0days. Under biochar influence, organic matter degradation, NH4\n+-N conversion and NO3\n\u2212-N production was accelerated, and dissolved total organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) utilization by microorganisms were enhanced. Biochar addition altered the microbial community and promoted the vital activity of Actinobacteria in the later composting stage. The antibiotics removal efficiency (except danofloxacin and enrofloxacin) was accelerated in the early composting stage (1\u201314\u00a0days) by biochar addition, the pile temperature had a positive effect on antibiotics removal, and the total antibiotics removal efficiency in CK and CK+Biochar treatments was 69.58% and 78.67% at the end of the composting process, respectively. The absolute abundance of most of the ARGs in the CK+Biochar treatment was lower than that in the CK treatment during composting, and the ARGs removal mainly occurred in the early (1\u201314\u00a0days) and later (28\u201350\u00a0days) stages. Biochar addition reduced the absolute abundance of MGEs (intI1, intI2) in the compost product, and most of the ARGs had a significant positive correlation with MGEs. Network analysis and redundancy analysis showed that ARGs and MGEs occurred in various host bacteria (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Halanaerobiaeota), and that DTN and NH4\n+-N are the main factors regulating the changes in bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and MGEs during composting. Moreover, MGEs contributed the most to the variation in ARGs. In summary, biochar addition during composting accelerated antibiotics removal and inhibited accumulation and transmission of ARGs. The results of this study could provide theoretical and technical support for biochar application for antibiotics and ARGs removal during livestock and poultry manure composting.", "1 Introduction", "1 Introduction", "In the past decade, livestock and poultry manure production in China exceeded 20 billion tons, and the proportion of pig manure production surpassed 30% (Wang et al., 2021a). Antibiotics are widely used in livestock and poultry farming to promote animal growth and disease prevention (Looft et al., 2012), and in China, 97,000 tons of antibiotics are used every year. The amount of some antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, macrolides, etc.) used in pig farming is more than 50% of the total use of certain antibiotics in the farming industry (Zhang et al., 2015). However, antibiotics are incompletely absorbed in animal tissues, with 30%\u201390% of antibiotics excreted with animal feces and urine (Heuer et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2019). The residual concentration of tetracycline (TC) in pig manure was noted to be the highest (Zhang et al., 2013). The discharged antibiotics may impose selective pressure on microorganisms in the environment, thereby inducing the production of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms as well as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (Wei et al., 2020). Previous study had detected all known types of ARGs in pig manures from some pig farms (Zhu et al., 2013). These manures are often used as organic fertilizers in farmland, resulting in antibiotics and ARGs entering the soil and penetrating into the deeper layers of the soil over time, and even into groundwater (Xie et al., 2018; Gu et al., 2019; Menz et al., 2019). The diversity and abundance of ARGs in soil have been found to significantly increase (Chen et al., 2016), especially in farmland (Mu et al., 2015), after long-term application of untreated livestock manure. Besides, ARGs spread in the environment through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) regulated by MGEs (Su et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017), which further threaten human health.", "In the past decade, livestock and poultry manure production in China exceeded 20 billion tons, and the proportion of pig manure production surpassed 30% (Wang et al., 2021a).

After composting, the removal rates of tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and macrolides antibiotics have been found to reach more than 90% (Kim et al., 2012), with some antibiotics (chlortetracycline (CTC), sulfadiazine) being completely removed (Selvam et al., 2012b). Antibiotics exert selective pressure on ARGs, and some ARGs persist even after complete degradation of antibiotics (Jechalke et al., 2014a). During pig manure composting, the relative abundances of tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes have been found to significantly decrease (Selvam et al., 2012a). However, composting cannot remove all ARGs, and different ARGs exhibit distinct trends during the composting process. For example, at the end of pig manure composting, the absolute abundance of tetC was significantly higher than the initial level (Zhang et al., 2017), whereas the abundance of tetX remained unchanged (Wang et al., 2015). ARGs can be transmitted between different microorganisms through MGEs (Cui et al., 2020), leading to the emergence of multi-drug-resistant microorganisms. Composting can effectively remove MGEs (Gou et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019), thereby inhibiting HGT of ARGs and reducing multi-drug resistance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A large number of pathogenic microorganisms isolated from pig manure have been reported to contain ARGs (Fang et al., 2015). Continuous high temperature during composting can lead to the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms (Qian et al., 2016b), thereby promoting ARGs removal. Some studies have reported that continuous high temperature could promote the removal of ARGs during composting (Wang et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2016; Youngquist et al., 2016), and facilitate antibiotics removal through degradation and adsorption (Arikan et al., 2007). However, some studies have indicated that the effect of high temperature on ARGs removal are not ideal (Huang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020). It can be seen that whether high temperature can remove ARGs is controversial. Besides, it should be noted that most of these previous studies had been conducted to explore the effects of aerobic composting on antibiotics in pig manure, and that the antibiotics had been artificially added to pig manure (Qian et al., 2016a; Song et al., 2020; Gou et al., 2021). The knowledge about the effect of composting on antibiotics and ARGs in realistic pig manure environment is still limited.", "Microorganisms, antibiotics, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are closely related, and composting has been reported to remove antibiotics and ARGs from pig manure (Li et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021c).

Corn straw is one of the effective materials that can regulate the MC and C/N ratio of the pile. Biochar is a carbon-rich material, produced by the pyrolysis of carbon-based biomass under nitrogen-rich conditions. Biochar has been applied as an additive in composting (Qiu et al., 2021). Addition of biochar makes it easier for the compost pile temperature to rise above 70\u00b0C (Czeka\u0142a et al., 2016); as a result, organic matter degradation is accelerated at the thermophilic stage of composting and nitrification is enhanced at the maturity stage of composting (S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2015). Besides, biochar can reduce nitrogen loss and gas emission during composting (Awasthi et al., 2017), accelerate the composting process, alter the number and diversity of microorganisms during composting (Huang et al., 2020), and improve the living environment of the microorganisms and enhance their activity (Sanchez-Monedero et al., 2018). Different types of biochar prepared using diverse materials can have varying degrees of effects on bacterial communities during composting (Cui et al., 2016), which may affect the changes in ARGs. Antibiotics with animal feces into the environment caused antibiotics pollution (Sarmah et al., 2006). Furthermore, it will aggravate environmental pressure, induce the formation of microbial resistance, increase the probability of pathogen resistance, accelerate the generation and dissemination of ARGs, and pose a serious threat to human health and aquaculture (Duan et al., 2017). ARGs in the environment may invade animals or human body along the food chain or contact transmission, thereby increasing the host\u2019s resistance to antibiotics, resulting in antibiotics cannot achieve normal therapeutic effect, but also lead to difficult to treat human and animal diseases, threatening human life and health.

The rapid decrease in the DOC content in the CK+Biochar treatment could mainly be attributed to the quick rise in temperature resulting in an increase in microbial activity (Khan et al., 2014). After 10\u00a0days of composting, the DOC content in the CK treatment started to decrease and the microbial utilization of water-soluble organic matter accelerated, probably owing to the increased activity of thermophilic microorganisms caused by high temperatures at this stage.

As shown in Figure 2C, the NH4\n+-N content in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments exhibited a decreasing trend, which is not consistent with the previously reported results (Agyarko-Mintah et al., 2017). This may be owing to the high frequency of turning of the pile during the composting period in this study, which promoted oxygen exposure to the microorganisms. As NH4\n+-N is more likely to be converted to NO3\n\u2212-N by microorganisms in the presence of high level of oxygen in the environment (Canfield et al., 2010), a large amount of NO3\n\u2212-N was produced in both CK and CK+Biochar treatments in the early stage of composting (Figure 2D). However, addition of biochar increased the porosity of the pile and promoted air flow, resulting in the rapid conversion of NH4\n+-N in the CK+Biochar treatment, compared with that in the CK treatment. The NO3\n\u2212-N content in both CK and CK+Biochar treatments reached the maximum level on day 10, presenting 62.34% and 163.70% increase, respectively, which indicated that biochar could facilitate the vital activity of nitrifying bacteria. This effect of biochar might be caused by the specific pore structure of the biochar and the adsorption sites on its surface, which are beneficial to the adsorption of NH3 and NH4\n+, and provide a suitable environment for the metabolic activities of nitrifying bacteria. After 10\u00a0days of composting, the NO3\n\u2212-N content began to decrease after reaching its peak, possibly as a result of increase in the proportion of denitrifying bacteria, which promote the conversion of NO3\n\u2212-N to N2 and N2O (C\u00e1ceres et al., 2018). Moreover, the temperature of the pile gradually increased to 70\u00b0C at this stage, which inhibited the activity of nitrifying bacteria.

Biodegradation is an important pathway for the removal of tetracyclines antibiotics during pig manure composting (Wang et al., 2015). It must be noted that tetracyclines antibiotics are easily adsorbed by the medium in the environment (Tolls, 2001; Thiele-Bruhn and Beck, 2005), and addition of biochar, which has a rich pore structure and large number of binding sites, can facilitate the adsorption of tetracyclines antibiotics on the biochar surface and pores, and enhance the degradation of tetracyclines antibiotics by microorganisms adhering to the biochar. During 1\u201314\u00a0days of composting, the TYL removal rates in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments were 77.08% and 94.44%, respectively. TYL and TILM are amphoteric compounds with positive charges, which can form ion bonds with negatively charged components, such as the biochar surface, during composting (Tan et al., 2020); as a result, their removal was accelerated with biochar addition. At the end of composting, the removal rates of SD, SMR, OFX, CIP, DIF, and LCM in the CK treatment were 55.88%, 77.10%, 48.65%, 52.86%, 38.21%, and 40.23%, respectively, which were lower than those noted in the CK+Biochar treatment (68.32%, 84.75%, 87.24%, 64.73%, 62.55%, and 66.40%, respectively). In the presence of organic matter, high temperatures can lead to the production of more adsorption sites, decreasing the extractable concentration of sulfonamides antibiotics (Ezzariai et al., 2018). Biochar addition can inhibit the production of CO2 and reduce the loss of organic matter (Liu et al., 2017), thereby promoting the removal of sulfonamides in pig manure. The molecular structure of quinolone antibiotics comprises a large number of carboxyl, amino, and aromatic rings, which are easily adsorbed by humus (K\u00fcmmerer, 2009). At the end of composting, the total humic acid contents of CK and CK + Biochar treatments increased by 24.16% (from 62.02\u00a0g/kg to 77.01\u00a0g/kg) and 47.96% (from 64.78\u00a0g/kg to 95.85\u00a0g/kg), respectively. Biochar promotes the formation of humus during composting. Biodegradation is considered to be the main mechanism of LCM degradation (Alexandrino et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2018) and biochar can adsorb LCM for more than 200\u00a0days, exhibiting strong adsorption performance (Liu et al., 2019), which facilitates biodegradation of LCM. Bacillus, Saccharomonospora, and Georgenia presented significant negative correlations with TC, DOX, SD, SMR, DIF, TYL, and LCM concentrations (Supplementary Figure S4), indicating that these microorganisms can degrade antibiotics. Addition of biochar improved the activity of these microorganisms, thereby promoting the degradation of antibiotics during composting. In CK and CK+Biochar treatments, the concentration of DAN increased from 28.47 to 32.00\u00a0\u03bcg/kg and 23.49 to 32.32\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, and the concentration of ENR increased from 82.50 to 105.49\u00a0\u03bcg/kg and 68.06 to 146.32\u00a0\u03bcg/kg. Actinobacteria is considered to be the main producer of antibiotics (D'Costa et al., 2006), and Microbacterium and Brachybacterium, which belong to the phylum Actinobacteria, were significantly positively correlated with DAN and ENR concentrations, and their growth and reproduction during composting led to an increase in DAN and ENR concentrations. The results of this study revealed the high efficiency of antibiotic removal from co-composting of pig manure and corn straw with biochar. The removal rates of macrolide antibiotics were higher than that of other antibiotics at the early composting stage due to the differences in the types and chemical structures of antibiotics. Moreover, microorganisms are also important factors affecting the change of antibiotic concentration during composting.", "During the first 6\u00a0days of composting, 50.93%, 74.77%, 63.85% 66.13%, and 95.82% of TC, OTC, CTC, DOX, and TILM were removed in the CK+Biochar treatment, respectively, which were higher than those noted in the CK treatment (30.53%, 58.70%, 50.79%, 21.00%, and 68.28%, respectively).

This result is consistent with the findings of a previous study that demonstrated that nitrogen content is closely related to microbial growth (Chen et al., 2014). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was observed between DTN and NH4\n+-N contents and tetracyclines antibiotics, sulfonamides antibiotics, OFX, CIP, DIF, macrolides antibiotics, and LCM, indicating that biochar addition facilitated antibiotics removal from swine manure by promoting DTN utilization and NH4\n+-N transformation by microorganisms.
