However, the extensive usage of these antibiotics has resulted in the rapid development of bacterial resistance. The resistance mechanisms mainly include mutations of the rifamycin target RNA polymerase of bacteria and enzymatic modifications of rifamycin antibiotics. One modification is the recently characterized rifamycin degradation catalyzed by Rox enzymes, which belong to the widely occurring flavin monooxygenases. Intriguingly, our recent sequence analysis revealed the rifamycin producers also encode Rox homologs that are not yet characterized. In this work, we expanded the study of the Rox-catalyzed rifamycin degradation. We first showed that the Rox proteins from rifamycin producers have the enzymatic rifamycin SV-degrading activity. Then we used the structurally diverse rifamycin compounds rifampicin and 16-demethylrifamycin W to probe the substrate scope and found that they each have a slightly different substrate scope. Finally, we demonstrated that Rox proteins can also catalyze the transformation of 16-demethylsalinisporamycin to 16-demethylsaliniketal A. Since 16-demethylsalinisporamycin and 16-demethylsaliniketal A are the counterpart analogs of salinisporamycin and saliniketal A, our biochemical findings not only uncover a previously uncharacterized self-resistance mechanism in the rifamycin producers, but also bridge the gap between the biosynthesis of the potential antitumor compound saliniketal A.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Rifamycins (Rifs, Figure 1) are broad-spectrum antibiotics with potent antibiotic activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Floss and Yu, 2005). Their semi-synthetic derivatives, such as rifampicin, have long been mainstay components for the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, and AIDS-associated mycobacterial infections (Floss and Yu, 2005). Rif antibiotics target bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RNAPs), and thus inhibit RNA transcription (Campbell et al., 2001). The crystal structure determination of the Thermus aquaticus core RNAP complexed with rifampicin revealed a pocket for Rif binding to the RNAP \u03b2 subunit (RpoB) deep within the DNA/RNA channel (Campbell et al., 2001). For example, the four hydroxyl groups of Rif (at C-1, C-8, C-21, and C-23) form critical hydrogen bonds with RpoB. This strong interaction indicates that the antibiotic can effectively block the exit path for the newly-synthesized RNA (Campbell et al., 2001). However, the extensive usage of these antibiotics has resulted in the rapid development of bacterial resistance, and thus this class of antibiotics are commonly used in drug combinations (e.g., with isoniazid) and are restricted in treating tuberculosis or clinical emergencies so as to guarantee a relatively long lifespan of utility (Floss and Yu, 2005).", "Rifamycins (Rifs, Figure 1) are broad-spectrum antibiotics with potent antibiotic activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Floss and Yu, 2005).

(2018) previously used rifabutin and Rif S as competitive inhibitors to assess the Rox-mediated rifampicin monooxygenation and found that the naphthoquinone forms of rifamycins can overcome the monooxygenation reaction. Based on the crystal structures of SvRox in complex with FAD (and rifampicin) they reasoned that the bulky substituent at position 3 of rifabutin sterically impedes productive binding; although Rif S completely blocked the enzymatic activity, they found it was not a substrate for the monooxygenation reaction (Koteva et al., 2018). In the present study, however, we showed that both 16-demethylrifamycin W and 16-demethylsalinisporamycin of the naphthoquinone form can be accepted by the Rox proteins. Initially, we thought that the two compounds were first spontaneously reduced by NADPH, and then the reduced forms acted as direct substrates. However, we found that the two compounds could not be reduced even under the conditions of a 100-fold excess of NADPH (Supplementary Figure S10a), which led us to investigate Rif S reduction by NADPH. Interestingly, Rif S was easily reduced by NADPH, and converted by SsRox to the compound 1 (Supplementary Figure S10b). Meanwhile, our time-course analysis of Rif SV degradation revealed that Rif S was produced during the air oxidation of Rif SV and then consumed in the assays (Supplementary Figure S10c). Previous mechanisms of Rif degradation suggest that a C-1 phenolic hydroxyl group is required to trigger the monooxygenation (Koteva et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). Specifically, the deprotonation of the C-1 hydroxyl group is not initiated by a catalytic base from Rox but facilitated by the hydrogen bond network between the Rif C-1/C-8 hydroxyl groups and the N5 atom of the reduced FAD cofactor. Next, the resultant anion at C-2 attacks C4a-hydroperoxyflavin, generating the hydroxyl intermediate at C-2, followed by ring-opening to form the degradation product (Supplementary Figure S3). However, for substrates of the naphthoquinone form, the C-2 carbon is actually electrophilic and might be directly attacked by the peroxyflavin to form (hydro)peroxyrifamycin, which is similar to but different from the Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidation mechanism (Huijbers et al., 2014). The decomposition of (hydro)peroxyrifamycin to the degradation product may be facilitated by the excessive NADPH. This latter mechanism is also consistent with one of the two hypotheses by Wilson et al. (2010; Supplementary Figure S5).
