Nonomuraea gerenzanensis ATCC 39727 is the most studied representative species since it produces the glycopeptide antibiotic (GPA) A40926 \u2013 the precursor of the clinically relevant antibiotic dalbavancin, approved by the FDA in 2014 for the treatment of acute skin infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The clinical relevance of dalbavancin has prompted increased attention on A40926 biosynthesis and its regulation. In this paper, we investigated how to enhance the genetic toolkit for members of the Nonomuraea genus, which have proved quite recalcitrant to genetic manipulation. By constructing promoter-probe vectors, we tested the activity of 11 promoters (heterologous and native) using the GusA reporter system in N. gerenzanensis and in Nonomuraea coxensis; this latter species is phylogenetically distant from N. gerenzanesis and also possesses the genetic potential to produce A40926 or a very similar GPA. Finally, the strongest constitutive promoter analyzed in this study, aac(3)IVp, was used to overexpress the cluster-situated regulatory genes controlling A40926 biosynthesis (dbv3 and dbv4 from N. gerenzanensis and nocRI from N. coxensis) in N. gerenzanensis, and the growth and productivity of the best performing strains were assessed at bioreactor scale using an industrial production medium. Overexpression of positive pathway-specific regulatory genes resulted in a significant increase in the level of A40926 production in N. gerenzanensis, providing a new knowledge-based approach to strain improvement for this valuable glycopeptide antibiotic.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Research on glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) \u2013 drugs of \u201clast resort\u201d for treating severe infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens \u2013 has experienced a \u201crenaissance\u201d over the last decade (Marcone et al., 2018). Clinically important GPAs include two natural products (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and three second generation antibiotics (telavancin, dalbavancin, and oritavancin), which are semisynthetic derivatives of natural products endowed with an increased antimicrobial potency and superior pharmacokinetic properties. The urgent need for new potent antibiotics has driven much recent interest in GPAs. For example, chemical synthesis recently resulted in the generation of a plethora of vancomycin derivatives with novel modifications that show superior antimicrobial activities (Okano et al., 2017; Wu and Boger, 2019), while teicoplanin has been conjugated with nanoparticles resulting in increased activity against biofilm-forming pathogens (Armenia et al., 2018).", "Research on glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) \u2013 drugs of \u201clast resort\u201d for treating severe infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens \u2013 has experienced a \u201crenaissance\u201d over the last decade (Marcone et al., 2018).

Recent work (Haslinger et al., 2015; Peschke et al., 2017; Schoppet et al., 2019) has revealed new details of the specificity and timing of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, including chlorination and cross-linking steps, suggesting that the use of combinatorial biosynthesis to generate GPAs with completely novel oligopeptide scaffolds should be possible. In parallel, heterologous expression of enzymes involved in later stages of GPA biosynthesis (glycosylation, sulfation, acylation etc.) in known producers or in vitro has already generated novel GPA derivatives that could not be prepared easily by chemical synthesis (Banik and Brady, 2008; Banik et al., 2010; Yim et al., 2014).", "In contrast, genetic manipulation of GPA producers to yield novel potent derivatives is in its infancy.

Although the global regulation of GPA biosynthesis is still largely unexplored, the pathway-specific regulation controlling the expression of BGCs is being elucidated in model systems (Bibb, 2013). The roles of cluster-situated regulatory genes have been investigated in Amycolatopsis balhimycina (Shawky et al., 2007), Nonomuraea gerenzanensis (Lo Grasso et al., 2015; Alduina et al., 2018), and Actinoplanes teichomyceticus (Horbal et al., 2014b; Yushchuk et al., 2019), producing balhimycin, A40926 (the natural precursor of dalbavancin), and teicoplanin, respectively. Overexpression of the teicoplanin cluster-situated regulatory genes (tei15*, coding for a StrR-like transcriptional regulator, and tei16*, coding for a LuxR-type regulator) in A. teichomyceticus markedly increased teicoplanin production in the wild type strain, representing one of the most successful examples of using molecular tools for improving antibiotic production (Horbal et al., 2012, 2014b).

The A40926-producing strain, recently re-classified as N. gerenzanensis (Dalmastri et al., 2016), belongs to a still poorly investigated genus of actinobacteria that was only recently identified as an untapped source of novel antibiotics and other bioactive metabolites (Sungthong and Nakaew, 2015).

In this paper, we report that another member of this genus, Nonomuraea coxensis DSM 45129, which was isolated in Bangladesh in 2007 (Ara et al., 2007), has the genetic potential to produce A40926 or a very similar GPA; its BGC contains two regulatory genes, nocRI and nocRII, which are close homologs of dbv3 and dbv4, respectively. Thus, we first developed the molecular tools to manipulate both N. gerenzanensis and N. coxensis, we then selected the strongest heterologous promoter to drive gene expression in Nonomuraea spp., and finally we overexpressed both native and heterologous cluster-specific regulatory genes in N. gerenzanensis, assessing the best performers at flask and bioreactor scale in industrial media.

More generally, these vectors should be useful for the genetic manipulation of other members of the genus Nonomuraea, which have the potential to produce novel valuable specialized metabolites (Sungthong and Nakaew, 2015; Nazari et al., 2017).", "As in the case of Actinoplanes spp. (Horbal et al., 2013), the strongest heterologous promoter was aac(3)IVp, although some N. gerenzanensis native promoters like hrdBngp and rpsLngp appeared to have comparable strength and merit further investigations. When we used aac(3)IVp to overexpress the cluster-situated regulatory genes dbv3 and dbv4 from the N. gerenzanensis dbv gene cluster and nocRI (dbv3-like) from the A40926-like BGC of N. coxensis, the recombinant N. gerenzanensis strains produced significantly more A40926 than the parental strain. The evidence that the heterologous expression of nocRI increased A40926 production in N. gerenzanensis confirmed its role in regulating the expression of a A40926-like BGC in N. coxensis. Additionally, it represents another case of cross-talk between regulators controlling GPA BGCs in producing actinomycetes (Spohn et al., 2014). Our next goal will be to investigate if and how (in which cultivation conditions) N. coxensis produces A40926 or a A40926-like molecule.", "As in the case of Actinoplanes spp. (Horbal et al., 2013), the strongest heterologous promoter was aac(3)IVp, although some N. gerenzanensis native promoters like hrdBngp and rpsLngp appeared to have comparable strength and merit further investigations.

In this paper, we tested the real industrial potential of overexpressing not only dbv3, but also dbv4, and dbv3 and dbv4 together, cloning them under the strong constitutive aac(3)IVp promoter, scaling up their cultivation at bioreactor scale and using a previously optimized industrial medium where A40926 is produced in hundreds of milligrams per liter (Marcone et al., 2010a, 2014). At the bioreactor level, where strains could have a different performance from the flask-cultivation due to different mixing and mass transfer rates of nutrients and oxygen, the best performer was the strain carrying both dbv4 under aac(3)IVp and dbv3 under its own endogenous promoter. This strain produced nearly 800 mg/l of A40926, which is twice that of the parental strain grown under the same conditions. Conversely, the strain carrying only dbv3 expressed from aac(3)IVp showed reduced production capacity and an altered phenotype particularly after scaling up from flask to bioreactor; in contrast, the dbv4 overexpressing recombinant grew similarly under both conditions. It is widely recognized that any potentially higher producing mutant or derivative needs to be validated in a bioreactor-scale fermentation since unpredictable discrepancies in strain performance can occur during scaling up from flask culture (Lee and Kim, 2015). In the case of the dbv3 overexpressing recombinant, we believe that the fragmented mycelial phenotype, which was much more apparent in the bioreactor, could be a specific consequence of the overexpression of the dbv7 gene encoding a d,d-carboxypeptidase known as VanYn (Binda et al., 2012). The level of VanYn activity in cell extracts from the dbv3-carrying recombinant cultivated at bioreactor scale was found to be much higher than in the parental strain (unpublished data). Consistent with this, overexpression of VanYn altered the mycelial morphology in N. gerenzanensis as well as in heterologous hosts such as streptomycetes strains (Binda et al., 2013).", "Previous work (Lo Grasso et al., 2015) reported that overexpression of dbv3 (under the control of the thiostrepton-inducible tipA* promoter in the integrative plasmid pIJ8600) in N. gerenzanensis increased A40926 production from 13 to 27 mg/l using the laboratory medium R3 (Lo Grasso et al., 2015).

Dalbavancin is the first antibiotic designated as a Qualified Infection Diseases Product by the FDA because of its potency, extended dosing interval, and unique dose regimen, but its cost largely exceeds that of first-generation GPAs and consequently its use in hospitals is still limited (Chiasson and White, 2016; Agarwal et al., 2018). Improving A40926-producing strains might lead to a decrease in the cost of dalbavancin. As demonstrated in this paper, A40926 production could be significantly enhanced by manipulating the expression of dbv cluster-situated regulators. An important and often-neglected aspect is testing the genetic stability and productivity of the selected recombinant strains in a fully developed industrial process at bioreactor level, which mimics the conditions of antibiotic large scale production. We were able to demonstrate here that the improvements we made to A40926 production levels in shake flasks were also achieved in the bioreactor, indicating the relevance of this approach to industrial-scale strain improvement.", "In conclusion, only a few GPAs are used in clinical practice and those produced by semi-synthesis from natural products, such as dalbavancin derived from A40926, are still quite expensive.
