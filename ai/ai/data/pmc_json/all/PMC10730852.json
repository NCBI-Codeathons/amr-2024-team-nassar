["Metagenomic-based studies have predicted an extraordinary number of potential antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs). These ARGs are hidden in various environmental bacteria and may become a latent crisis for antibiotic therapy via horizontal gene transfer. In this study, we focus on a resistance gene cph, which encodes a phosphotransferase (Cph) that confers resistance to the antituberculosis drug capreomycin (CMN). Sequence Similarity Network (SSN) analysis classified 353 Cph homologues into five major clusters, where the proteins in cluster I were found in a broad range of actinobacteria. We examine the function and antibiotics targeted by three putative resistance proteins in cluster I via biochemical and protein structural analysis. Our findings reveal that these three proteins in cluster I confer resistance to CMN, highlighting an important aspect of CMN resistance within this gene family. This study contributes towards understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of the phosphorylation resistance genes that confer resistance to CMN.", "Environmental bacteria contain antibiotic-resistance genes, which worsens the antibiotic resistance crisis.

Degradation bands were observed on the SDS-PAGE for the wild-type Cph001 after a week of storage at 4 \u00b0C. This might be the reason why the wild-type Cph001 could not be crystallized. After multiple attempts to obtain the crystals of the wild-type Cph001, we switched to focus on the Cph001D189N variant, which is more stable than the wild-type and can be crystallized at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Crystals of Cph001D189N were successfully obtained in a week and the diffraction data were collected at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) on beamlines 15A, 05A, or 07A. The molecular packing of Cph001D189N belongs to the orthorhombic space group P212121. The crystal structure of Cph001D189N in apo form was determined by the molecular replacement (MR) method, with the structure of Cph (PDB entry 7F0A)27 as the initial search model. Two polypeptide chains were found and built in the asymmetric unit (Fig.\u00a05a). The final model of Cph001D189N was refined to a resolution of 2.3\u2009\u00c5. Furthermore, we obtained ligand complex structures by soaking CMN IIA, CMN IIB, VIO, ATP, or GTP into the crystals of Cph001D189N. Seven structures of Cph001D189N complexes were determined by the MR method using the apo protein as the search model: Cph001D189N-CMN IIA, Cph001D189N-CMN IIB, Cph001D189N-VIO, Cph001D189N-ATP, Cph001D189N-GTP, Cph001D189N-CMN IIA/ATP, and Cph001D189N-VIO/ATP. The final models of the binary complex structures, Cph001D189N-CMN IIA, Cph001D189N-CMN IIB, Cph001D189N-VIO, Cph001D189N-ATP, and Cph001D189N-GTP, were refined to resolutions between 1.95\u2009\u00c5 to 2.26\u2009\u00c5, and the ternary structures, Cph001D189N-CMN IIA/ATP and Cph001D189N-VIO/ATP, were refined to resolutions between 2.00\u2009\u00c5 and 3.00\u2009\u00c5, respectively. The extra electron density in the putative active site can be identified and unambiguously fitted with the molecular conformation of CMN IIA, CMN IIB, VIO, ATP, and GTP in the corresponding complex structures (Supplementary Fig.\u00a016). The summary of crystallographic data and refinement statistics of Cph001D189N and the seven complex structures are shown in Table\u00a01.Fig. 5Crystal structures of Cph001.a Dimer of Cph001.

The polypeptide chain of Cph001 is folded into two domains, an N-terminal lobe domain (Met1\u2013Gly97) and a C-terminal domain (Ala98\u2013Arg286). The C-terminal domain further divided into a core subdomain (Ala98\u2013Ala140 and Thr182\u2013Ser246) and an \u03b1-helical subdomain (Pro141\u2013Ile181 and Asp247\u2013Arg286) (Fig.\u00a05b). The complex structures, Cph001D189N-CMN IIA, Cph001D189N-CMN IIB, Cph001D189N-ATP, and Cph001D189N-GTP, revealed that CMN IIA and CMN IIB bind to the C-terminal domain while ATP and GTP bind to the N-terminal lobe domain opposite to CMN (Fig.\u00a05b). Except for the \u03b2-lysine moiety that is flexible in the binding pocket, the pentapeptide backbones of CMN IIA and CMN IIB are found in a similar conformation. The residues involved in CMN binding are conserved between Cph001 and Cph (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013).
