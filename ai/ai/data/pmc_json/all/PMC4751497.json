["This work contributes to the understanding of cell wall modifications during sporulation and germination in Streptomyces by assessing the biological function and biochemical properties of SCO4439, a D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase (DD-CPase) constitutively expressed during development. SCO4439 harbors a DD-CPase domain and a putative transcriptional regulator domain, separated by a putative transmembrane region. The recombinant protein shows that DD-CPase activity is inhibited by penicillin G. The spores of the SCO4439::Tn5062 mutant are affected in their resistance to heat and acid and showed a dramatic increase in swelling during germination. The mycelium of the SCO4439::Tn5062 mutant is more sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). The DD-CPase domain and the hydrophobic transmembrane region are highly conserved in Streptomyces, and both are essential for complementing the wild type phenotypes in the mutant. A model for the biological mechanism behind the observed phenotypes is proposed, in which SCO4439 DD-CPase releases D-Ala from peptidoglycan (PG) precursors, thereby reducing the substrate pool for PG crosslinking (transpeptidation). PG crosslinking regulates spore physical resistance and germination, and modulates mycelium resistance to glycopeptides. This study is the first demonstration of the role of a DD-CPase in the maturation of the spore cell wall.", "Streptomycetes are mycelial microorganisms characterized by their complex developmental cycles, including programmed cell death (PCD) and hyphae differentiation, which leads to aerial mycelium formation and sporulation12. Streptomycetes are important industrial bacteria producing approximately two-thirds of clinical antibiotics, as well as a large number of eukaryotic cell differentiation inducers and inhibitors3. Most of these bioactive compounds are specialized metabolites4, the production of which is regulated, at least in part, by hyphal differentiation5. Streptomyces development, is activated by extracellular signals, including nutritional stimuli or cell density (quorum sensing), and is regulated by complex signaling pathways that are only partially known567. The best-characterized stages of Streptomyces development are those related to aerial mycelium and sporulation. Several key regulatory networks controlling these stages have been characterised (bald, sky or white pathways, reviewed in Fl\u00e4rdh and Buttner1). Despite this, the regulation of aerial mycelium and sporulation remains incompletely understood, and new genes and proteins regulating these important processes, are still being discovered8. Stages preceding aerial mycelium, including spore germination and differentiation in liquid non-sporulating cultures, are even less characterized and comprehended29.", "D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidases (DD-CPases) are members of the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs), a family of proteins inhibited by \u00df-lactam antibiotics involved in peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis and remodelling. The PBPs constitute a family of acyltransferases with a common evolutionary origin and a common substrate (the D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptides present in the pentapeptide stems of PG precursors), that are collectively known as DD-peptidases. DD-peptidases include transglycosylases, which catalyze the polymerization of glycan chains composed of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM); DD-CPases, which remove the terminal D-alanine from muramyl pentapeptide; transpeptidases, which catalyze the cross-link formation between one D-Ala of one PG strand and one amino acid of the other strand; and endopeptidases, which cleave the cross-linked peptide side-chains10. The DD-peptidases are classified on the basis of their molecular mass, amino acid sequence and enzyme activity at high molecular mass (HMM) and low molecular mass (LMM)111213. HMM DD-peptidases are usually bifunctional transglycosylases/transpeptidases (also classified as class A), or monofunctional transpeptidases (class B) anchored to membranes. LMM DD-peptidases are monofunctional carboxypeptidases or endopeptidases, and the majority are also anchored to membranes (class C). LMM DD-peptidases are usually not essential, and they are not found in most studies and reviews on PBPs13.", "Most bacteria have multiple PBPs with varying degrees of redundant activity. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that Actinobacteria have an average of five HMM DD-peptidases per genome; this number doubled only in streptomycetes (13 DD-peptidases in the case of S. coelicolor)13. Many DD-peptidases belong to the SEDS (shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) clusters of genes involved in PG synthesis and remodeling and are essential for growth, cell division, and cellular viability. DD-peptidases that are not included in the SEDS clusters are considered dispensable for growth and viability10, and their biological function remains poorly investigated. Streptomyces coelicolor harbors four SEDS clusters14, that include four transpeptidases (SCO2090, SCO2608, SCO3847 and SCO5301).", "This work contributes characterizing the biological function of the largely ignored redundant and non-essential LMM DD-peptidases by studying the activity and role of SCO4439, a gene encoding a putative DD-CPase. SCO4439 is a very unusual DD-CPase that is highly conserved in streptomycetes and is therein fused with a putative transcriptional regulator domain (see below).
