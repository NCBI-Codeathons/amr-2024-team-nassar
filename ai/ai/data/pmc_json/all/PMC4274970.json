Recent advances in genome sequencing and techniques in genetic manipulation have enabled researchers to study the biosynthetic genes of these SMs. Aspergillus terreus is the well-known producer of lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug. This fungus also produces other SMs, including acetylaranotin, butyrolactones, and territram, with interesting bioactivities. This review will cover recent progress in genome mining of SMs identified in this fungus. The identification and characterization of the gene cluster for these SMs, as well as the proposed biosynthetic pathways, will be discussed in depth.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Filamentous fungi, such as species found within the genus Aspergillus, are known to produce a wide variety of natural products displaying a broad spectrum of biological activities. Genome sequencing of members in the genus Aspergillus revealed that the number of secondary metabolite (SM) genes or gene clusters greatly exceeds the number of SMs identified so far. This suggests that more types of SMs still remain to be discovered. Efficient and high-throughput genome sequencing techniques have now greatly facilitated the genome mining of SMs identified in Aspergillus species. More and more studies have shown that most fungal SM genes are clustered, often separated from each other by less than 2 kb within the chromosome (Keller et al., 2005). Striking examples of fungal SM clusters include those responsible for the biosynthesis of fumonisin (Proctor et al., 2003) and sterigmatocystin (Brown et al., 1996). The clustering of these SM genes is fortuitous for researchers since upon discovering one responsible gene within a cluster, other genes that are within close proximity of the identified genes may be involved in the biosynthesis of the same natural product.", "Filamentous fungi, such as species found within the genus Aspergillus, are known to produce a wide variety of natural products displaying a broad spectrum of biological activities.

Verification of function of the relevant genes can be achieved via several approaches. These approaches include targeted deletion or over-expression of the relevant genes in the native organism, heterologous expression in an alternative host, or in vitro biochemical characterization. Recent advances in the genome editing of Aspergillus nidulans have greatly expedited the SM genome mining of this fungal species (Sanchez et al., 2012). One advance is the development of a fusion PCR technique that allows quick synthesis of linear PCR fragments that are used in the transformation of filamentous fungi (Yu et al., 2004; Szewczyk et al., 2006). Another advance concerns the establishment of an efficient gene targeting system in the fungus A. nidulans. This is accomplished via targeted deletion of the A. nidulans homolog (nkuA) of the human KU70 gene which is essential for non-homologous end joining of DNA in DNA double-strand breaks (Nayak et al., 2006; Szewczyk et al., 2006). Later, this ku70 deletion toolbox was expanded to other Aspergillus species and boosted the gene targeting efficiency in these species (Kuck and Hoff, 2010).", "Analysis of the fungal genome makes it feasible to characterize these SM gene clusters via genetic manipulations.

Previous isotope-labeling studies revealed that the biosynthesis of terrein originates from a polyketide-based pathway (Birch et al., 1965) and involves the contraction of a six-membered ring precursor to give the five-membered ring terrein (25) (Hill et al., 1981). The terrein cluster contains a total of 11 genes, including an NR-PKS gene terA (ATEG_00145.1) and a transcription factor gene, terR (Figure 1). In the terrein biosynthetic pathway as shown in Figure 6, the NR-PKS encoded by terA condensates one acetyl-CoA and four malonyl-CoA to synthesize the precursor 2,3-dehydro-6-hydroxymellein (23). Heterologous expression of terA in A. niger revealed that the NR-PKS TerA is also capable of producing compounds 21 and 22 by incorporating different number of malonyl-CoAs as substrates. The reduction of compound 23 to 6-hydroxymellein (6-HM) (24) is probably catalyzed by TerB, but it is also possible that other unspecific ketoreductases may perform this reduction. The authors proposed that the conversion of 6-HM (24) to the final product terrein (25) might involve four genes, terC, terD, terE, and terF while the specific roles of these genes await further verification. Interestingly, the study also revealed that terrein (25) has phytotoxic activity. In the two experiments, terrein (25), rather than the intermediates or shunt products, inhibited root elongation and caused lesions on fruit surface (Zaehle et al., 2014), representing a prime example of how fungal secondary metabolites might play a role in fungus-plant interactions.", "The terrein (25) cluster was serendipitously identified while the Brock group were initially looking for secondary metabolites that are involved in the biosynthesis of conidia pigment in A. terreus (Zaehle et al., 2014).

Previous research using isotope-labeled precursors has shown that the biosynthesis of terreic acid originated from one polyketide, 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA, 26) (Read and Vining, 1968; Read et al., 1969). The PKS gene atX was cloned and identified as a 6-MSA (26) synthase (Fujii et al., 1996). A recent bioinformatic analysis study predicts that the PKS gene atX and its surrounding genes encodes the biosynthetic cluster which is responsible for terreic acid biosynthesis (Boruta and Bizukojc, 2014). The cluster was experimentally characterized using a targeted gene deletion method (Guo et al., 2014). The cluster contains a total of eight genes, including a partially reducing PKS (PRPKS) gene, atX, and a transcription factor gene atF (Figure 1).
