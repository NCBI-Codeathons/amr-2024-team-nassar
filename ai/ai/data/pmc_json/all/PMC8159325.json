However, engineering the pathway to the thiomarinol antibiotics has proved challenging. Here we report that genes from a marine Pseudoalternomonas sp. producing thiomarinol can be expressed in functional form in the biosynthesis of the clinically important antibiotic mupirocin from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is revealed that both pathways employ the same unusual mechanism of tetrahydropyran (THP) ring formation and the enzymes are cross compatible. Furthermore, the efficiency of downstream processing of 10,11-epoxy versus 10,11-alkenic metabolites are comparable. Optimisation of the fermentation conditions in an engineered strain in which production of pseudomonic acid A (with the 10,11-epoxide) is replaced by substantial titres of the more stable pseudomonic acid C (with a 10,11-alkene) pave the way for its development as a more stable antibiotic with wider applications than mupirocin.", "Where the sea meets the land: the mupirocin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) from the terrestrial bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens was repurposed via a plug-and-play approach with heterologous genes from the marine strain that produces thiomarinol.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Rapid acceleration in the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria is severely eroding our ability to treat bacterial infections.1 Central to an effective response to this problem is the development of novel antibiotics with activity against bacteria resistant to existing agents.
