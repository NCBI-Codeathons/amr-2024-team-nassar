["Cystargolides are natural products originally isolated from Kitasatospora cystarginea NRRL B16505 as inhibitors of the proteasome. They are composed of a dipeptide backbone linked to a \u03b2-lactone warhead. Recently, we identified the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster, but systematic genetic analyses had not been carried out because of the lack of a heterologous expression system. Here, we report the discovery of a homologous cystargolide biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces durhamensis NRRL-B3309 by genome mining. The gene cluster was cloned via transformation-associated recombination and heterologously expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor M512. We demonstrate that it contains all genes necessary for the production of cystargolide A and B. Single gene deletion experiments reveal that only five of the eight genes from the initially proposed gene cluster are essential for cystargolide synthesis. Additional insights into the cystargolide pathway could be obtained from in\u00a0vitro assays with CysG and chemical complementation of the respective gene knockout. This could be further supported by the in\u00a0vitro investigation of the CysG homolog BelI from the belactosin biosynthetic gene cluster. Thereby, we confirm that CysG and BelI catalyze a cryptic SAM-dependent transfer of a methyl group that is critical for the construction of the cystargolide and belactosin \u03b2-lactone warheads.", "Keywords", "Abbreviations", "biosynthetic gene cluster", "extracted ion chromatogram", "high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry", "Isopropylmalate", "Isopropylmalate synthase", "tandem mass spectrometry", "non-ribosomal peptide synthetase", "polyketide synthetase", "transformation associated recombination", "total ion chromatogram", "S-adenosyl methionine", "3-sec-butyl malate", "Reviewed by members of the JBC Editorial Board. Edited by Sarah E. O'Connor", "The proteasome is the central component in non-lysosomal protein degradation (1, 2). It plays a vital role in a multitude of cellular processes, such as cell cycle control (3), apoptosis (4), and immune response (5). The multi-subunit protein complex is associated with various diseases including neurodegenerative (6, 7) or cardiovascular disorders (8) and different types of cancers (9). Consequently, the proteasome is a validated target for the development of small-molecule pharmaceutics. Most of these are designed to covalently bind the catalytic subunits and inactivate the active site in a reversible or irreversible manner (10). Cystargolides A and B were originally isolated from Kitasatospora cystarginea NRRL B16505 and were found to inhibit the human proteasome and the caseinolytic protease ClpP in the micromolar range (11,\u00a012, 13). The cystargolides feature a \u03b2-lactone warhead and a dipeptide backbone similar to the well-characterized belactosins (Fig.\u00a01). Belactosins A and C are produced by Streptomyces sp. UCK 14 and, in analogy to the cystargolides, primarily block the function of the chymotrypsin-like \u03b25 subunit of the 20S proteasome (14, 15). Notably, many \u03b2-lactone-containing secondary metabolites are synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) or polyketide synthases (PKSs) (16, 17). We recently identified the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and constructed gene disruption mutants in K.\u00a0cystarginea NRRL B16505 (18). This revealed that the cystargolide and belactosin formation does not involve NRPS or PKS machinery but proceeds via single enzyme amino acid ligases. Intriguingly, the route to the carbon scaffold of their \u03b2-lactone warheads is reminiscent of leucine biosynthesis. Here, we present a homologous cystargolide BGC from Streptomyces durhamensis NRRL-B3309. The gene cluster was cloned via transformation-associated recombination (TAR) and heterologously expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 allowing a systematic set of gene knockouts to investigate the functions of the encoded proteins.Figure\u00a01Chemical structure of cystargolides and belactosins.", "Figure\u00a01Chemical structure of cystargolides and belactosins.", "Chemical structure of cystargolides and belactosins.", "Results", "Results", "In order to characterize the biosynthetic pathway of the cystargolides, we attempted to heterologously express the BGC we identified in K.\u00a0cystarginea NRRL B16505 (18).

Therefore, the genes were individually replaced with an apramycin resistance cassette using the PCR-targeting system (23). Unmarked in-frame gene deletions were generated by excision of the resistance cassettes, taking advantage of the flanking FLP recombination target (FRT) sites. S.\u00a0coelicolor M512 derivatives containing the modified gene clusters were cultivated and analyzed by LC-MS. This revealed that cystargolide production was not impacted in the knockout mutants with \u0394cysA and \u0394cysB (Fig.\u00a03). Interestingly, the gene cysA codes for an isopropylmalate synthase-homolog and is likely to be involved in the formation of 2-isopropylmalate (2-IPM) from acetyl-CoA and \u03b1-ketoisovalerate. Isopropylmalate synthases (IPMS) are essential for de novo leucine biosynthesis and are a central part of the bacterial primary metabolism. Therefore, the loss of cysA might be complemented by the house-keeping IPMS homolog from the host organism. Indeed, a BLAST analysis of the genome of S.\u00a0coelicolor detected a putative IPMS (SCO2528) with a sequence identity of 58% on protein level. CysB is a putative major facilitator superfamily (MFS) permease of the DHA2-family. Such transporters have been associated with the extrusion of a variety of chemicals and can confer resistance and self-resistance to antibiotically active compounds (24, 25). We propose that CysB is involved in the export of cystargolides. However, the detected cystargolide production in the respective \u0394cysB mutant suggests that the function of CysB in cystargolide secretion is supported by the activity of other intrinsic transporter systems. Indeed, analysis of the cell culture supernatant and the mycelium showed that cystargolides are present in both, the medium and the cells. This was observed for the intact gene cluster as well as the \u0394cysB mutant (Fig.\u00a0S6). The gene cysH encodes a putative LysR-family regulatory protein. These type of proteins are known as transcriptional activators (26). LC-MS analysis of the \u0394cysH mutant culture extracts revealed a drastically reduced cystargolide production (Table\u00a0S6). This strongly indicates that CysH functions as a positive regulator in regards to the cystargolide biosynthesis. In contrast, the knockouts \u0394cysC, \u0394cysD, \u0394cysE, \u0394cysF and \u0394cysG resulted in the complete abolishment of cystargolide formation (Fig.\u00a03). Of those, three genes, cysC, cysD and cysF, code for putative ATP-dependent carboxylic acid-activating enzymes. CysC and CysF show homology to adenylating enzymes. They generate high-energy acyl-AMP phosphoester intermediates to facilitate e.g. the formation of amide bonds, coenzyme A and acyl-carrier protein (ACP) thioesters or general transesterification reactions. CysD is predicted as a member of the ATP-grasp family which forms reactive acyl monophosphate intermediates that allow similar biochemistry as the adenylates (27, 28, 29). We thus conclude that CysC, CysD, and CysF are involved in converting three carboxylic acid groups to form two amides and a cyclic ester in cystargolide biosynthesis. On the other hand, CysG is a putative SAM-dependent methyltransferase whereas CysE is homologous to methylesterases with a predicted alpha/beta-hydrolase topology. Both enzymes have no obvious function in cystargolide biosynthesis, but intriguingly, a similar methyltransferase/methylesterase pair is encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster of belactosins (Fig.\u00a02; Table\u00a0S2) (18, 30, 31). This finding led us to speculate that CysE and CysG might be involved in the formation of the characteristic \u03b2-lactone warhead. Indeed, the complete loss of cystargolide production in the respective gene deletion mutants appear to support this hypothesis (Fig.\u00a03).", "In order to determine the function of the clustered genes, single-gene knockout variants of the cys BGC were heterologously expressed in S.\u00a0coelicolor M512.

Isopropylmalate synthases (IPMS) are essential for de novo leucine biosynthesis and are a central part of the bacterial primary metabolism. Therefore, the loss of cysA might be complemented by the house-keeping IPMS homolog from the host organism. Indeed, a BLAST analysis of the genome of S.\u00a0coelicolor detected a putative IPMS (SCO2528) with a sequence identity of 58% on protein level. CysB is a putative major facilitator superfamily (MFS) permease of the DHA2-family. Such transporters have been associated with the extrusion of a variety of chemicals and can confer resistance and self-resistance to antibiotically active compounds (24, 25). We propose that CysB is involved in the export of cystargolides. However, the detected cystargolide production in the respective \u0394cysB mutant suggests that the function of CysB in cystargolide secretion is supported by the activity of other intrinsic transporter systems. Indeed, analysis of the cell culture supernatant and the mycelium showed that cystargolides are present in both, the medium and the cells. This was observed for the intact gene cluster as well as the \u0394cysB mutant (Fig.\u00a0S6). The gene cysH encodes a putative LysR-family regulatory protein. These type of proteins are known as transcriptional activators (26). LC-MS analysis of the \u0394cysH mutant culture extracts revealed a drastically reduced cystargolide production (Table\u00a0S6). This strongly indicates that CysH functions as a positive regulator in regards to the cystargolide biosynthesis. In contrast, the knockouts \u0394cysC, \u0394cysD, \u0394cysE, \u0394cysF and \u0394cysG resulted in the complete abolishment of cystargolide formation (Fig.\u00a03). Of those, three genes, cysC, cysD and cysF, code for putative ATP-dependent carboxylic acid-activating enzymes. CysC and CysF show homology to adenylating enzymes. They generate high-energy acyl-AMP phosphoester intermediates to facilitate e.g. the formation of amide bonds, coenzyme A and acyl-carrier protein (ACP) thioesters or general transesterification reactions. CysD is predicted as a member of the ATP-grasp family which forms reactive acyl monophosphate intermediates that allow similar biochemistry as the adenylates (27, 28, 29). We thus conclude that CysC, CysD, and CysF are involved in converting three carboxylic acid groups to form two amides and a cyclic ester in cystargolide biosynthesis. On the other hand, CysG is a putative SAM-dependent methyltransferase whereas CysE is homologous to methylesterases with a predicted alpha/beta-hydrolase topology. Both enzymes have no obvious function in cystargolide biosynthesis, but intriguingly, a similar methyltransferase/methylesterase pair is encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster of belactosins (Fig.\u00a02; Table\u00a0S2) (18, 30, 31). This finding led us to speculate that CysE and CysG might be involved in the formation of the characteristic \u03b2-lactone warhead. Indeed, the complete loss of cystargolide production in the respective gene deletion mutants appear to support this hypothesis (Fig.\u00a03).", "In order to determine the function of the clustered genes, single-gene knockout variants of the cys BGC were heterologously expressed in S.\u00a0coelicolor M512. Therefore, the genes were individually replaced with an apramycin resistance cassette using the PCR-targeting system (23). Unmarked in-frame gene deletions were generated by excision of the resistance cassettes, taking advantage of the flanking FLP recombination target (FRT) sites. S.\u00a0coelicolor M512 derivatives containing the modified gene clusters were cultivated and analyzed by LC-MS.

The cluster contains eight genes, which are homologs of the original cys BGC from K.\u00a0cystarginea NRRL B16505. Via heterologous expression, we could unambiguously connect this BGC to the biosynthesis of cystargolides, confirming that it contains all genes necessary for the production of cystargolide A and B. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that the genes cysC-cysG are essential for this process. The putative methyltransferase CysG readily methylated 3-IPM in\u00a0vitro, suggesting that it catalyzes the same reaction in the cystargolide biosynthetic pathway and plays a crucial role in the formation of the \u03b2-lactone warhead. The methylation occurs at the C-1 carboxylic acid group of 3-IPM as revealed by NMR spectroscopy, proving that this modification is not involved in the lactonization. Thus we propose that CysG might act as a diverter, committing the primary metabolite 3-IPM to cystargolide biosynthesis and/or masking the 1-carboxylic acid group for the following biotransformations. These findings were supported by the functional characterization of the CysG homolog BelI. BelI catalyzed the methylation of 3-sec butylmalate in a SAM-dependent manner. Intriguingly, CysG and CysE as well as BelI and BelR exhibit conserved protein domains that are found in the methyltransferase/methylesterase pair BioC/BioH of the biotin synthesis pathway in proteobacteria (Figs.\u00a0S1 and S2) (34). BioC catalyzes a SAM-dependent methyl esterification of malonyl-ACP allowing its recognition as a starter unit by house-keeping charge-sensitive fatty acid synthetases. After two reiterations of the fatty acid elongation cycle, the generated pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester is hydrolyzed to pimeloyl-ACP and methanol by BioH. Pimeloyl-ACP is then further converted to biotin. One might speculate about a similar role for CysG and CysE in cystargolide biosynthesis. In this reaction trajectory the 3-IPM-1-methyl-ester product of CysG would undergo lactonization to afford a \u03b2-lactone methyl ester building block. Prior to amidation, the 1-carboxyl group is presumably liberated by CysE.

The methylation occurs at the C-1 carboxylic acid group of 3-IPM as revealed by NMR spectroscopy, proving that this modification is not involved in the lactonization. Thus we propose that CysG might act as a diverter, committing the primary metabolite 3-IPM to cystargolide biosynthesis and/or masking the 1-carboxylic acid group for the following biotransformations. These findings were supported by the functional characterization of the CysG homolog BelI. BelI catalyzed the methylation of 3-sec butylmalate in a SAM-dependent manner. Intriguingly, CysG and CysE as well as BelI and BelR exhibit conserved protein domains that are found in the methyltransferase/methylesterase pair BioC/BioH of the biotin synthesis pathway in proteobacteria (Figs.\u00a0S1 and S2) (34). BioC catalyzes a SAM-dependent methyl esterification of malonyl-ACP allowing its recognition as a starter unit by house-keeping charge-sensitive fatty acid synthetases. After two reiterations of the fatty acid elongation cycle, the generated pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester is hydrolyzed to pimeloyl-ACP and methanol by BioH. Pimeloyl-ACP is then further converted to biotin. One might speculate about a similar role for CysG and CysE in cystargolide biosynthesis. In this reaction trajectory the 3-IPM-1-methyl-ester product of CysG would undergo lactonization to afford a \u03b2-lactone methyl ester building block. Prior to amidation, the 1-carboxyl group is presumably liberated by CysE. Investigations to explore this hypothesis and open questions about the formation of the \u03b2-lactone warhead of cystargolides and belactosins will be addressed in future studies.", "Experimental procedures", "Experimental procedures", "General experiments", "General experiments", "General experiments", "Chemicals, micro-, and molecular biological agents were acquired from standard commercial sources.
