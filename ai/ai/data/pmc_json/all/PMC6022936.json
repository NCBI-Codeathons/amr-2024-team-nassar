["Glycopeptides (GPAs) are an important class of antibiotics, with vancomycin and teicoplanin being used in the last 40 years as drugs of last resort to treat infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. A few new GPAs have since reached the market. One of them is dalbavancin, a derivative of A40926 produced by the actinomycete Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727, recently classified as N. gerenzanensis. This review summarizes what we currently know on the multilevel regulatory processes governing production of the glycopeptide A40926 and the different approaches used to increase antibiotic yields. Some nutrients, e.g., valine, l-glutamine and maltodextrin, and some endogenous proteins, e.g., Dbv3, Dbv4 and RpoBR, have a positive role on A40926 biosynthesis, while other factors, e.g., phosphate, ammonium and Dbv23, have a negative effect. Overall, the results available so far point to a complex regulatory network controlling A40926 in the native producing strain.", "1. The Glycopeptides", "1. The Glycopeptides", "The glycopeptides are a class of antibiotics with a complex chemical structure and relatively high molecular weight.

The second-generation glycopeptides telavancin, derived from vancomycin, dalbavancin, derived from A40926, and oritavancin, derived from choloroeremomycin, were introduced onto the market in 2009, 2014 and 2015, respectively. All glycopeptides are used to treat persistent infections by Gram-positive multi-resistant pathogens [2]. The second-generation glycopeptides are nearly 4- to 8-fold more effective than vancomycin against Gram-positive pathogens, and are also active against vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus spp. [3]. While dalbavancin impedes the late steps of cell wall biosynthesis principally by blocking transglycosylase activity, oritavancin and telavancin bind to the bacterial membrane by the lipophilic side chain linked to their disaccharide moiety, disturbing membrane integrity and leading to bacteriolysis [3].", "The glycopeptides are a class of antibiotics with a complex chemical structure and relatively high molecular weight.

Future Perspectives", "This review summarizes the main achievements in understanding A40926 biosynthesis in N. gerenzanensis in relation to other glycopeptide producers and model Streptomyces strains. While many studies have addressed antibiotic production in model streptomycetes, like S. coelicolor, we continuously learn new mechanisms and pathways as we extend these analyses to industrially relevant antibiotics and, especially, to actinomycetes other than Streptomyces spp. In this respect, strains belonging to the genus Nonomuraea represent complex systems, with limited genetic tools available. Current results suggest an interplay between nutrients, resistance determinants and the end product. Even if many factors and proteins have been found to control A40926 biosynthesis (Figure 4), further studies are necessary to fill the many gaps present in our understanding of the strain\u2019s physiology and of the interplay between A40926 production and resistance before this information can be applied for A40926 yield improvement.", "This review summarizes the main achievements in understanding A40926 biosynthesis in N. gerenzanensis in relation to other glycopeptide producers and model Streptomyces strains.
