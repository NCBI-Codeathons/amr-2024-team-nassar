NRPSs are modular enzymes, in which each module adds a specific monomer to the peptide backbone. NRPS modules contain at least an adenylation domain (A) that determines the specificity for the substrate and activates it to start the synthesis, a thiolation (T) or peptide carrier protein (PCP) domain that binds covalently to the activated residue and a condensation domain (C) that elongates the peptidyl chain. Different types of C domains catalyze different types of condensation reactions [15]. Some NRPS assembly lines start with a special condensation domain, the C-Starter domain, which catalyzes the acylation of the first residue of the peptidyl chain, thereby synthetizing a lipopeptide [15].

Another group of NRPS-synthesized siderophores described from Rhodococcus is constituted by the catecholate-type siderophore rhequibactins synthesized by the rhequibactin BGC [20, 54]. These siderophores were described in R. equi 103S and two different NRPSs are involved in its biosynthesis, IupS and IupT; it is thought to be used only in saprophytic growth, since its deletion did not affect the pathogenicity but prevents the growth of the strain as a free-living organism [20]. The iupU gene was also described in this strain by Miranda-Casaluengo et al. [20] and was believed to be related to rhequibactin biosynthesis. The molecular product of this pathway was predicted to be a non-soluble siderophore believed to have a function similar to mycobactin, which is cell wall-bound and therefore not diffusible [36]. Recent work, describing the Rhodococcus antibiotics humimycins, identified the iupU gene as encoding the NRPS responsible for the synthesis of the molecule humimycin A [26]. Humimycins were synthesized based on the predicted product of the NRPS encoded by IupU and by another NRPS present in the R. erythropolis genome (encoding the biosynthesis of a variant, humimycin B). Both molecules showed potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), by targeting lipid II flippases [26]. The NRPSs contain a C-starter domain, which indicated that the first residue of the NRP is acylated. Therefore, a \u03b2-hydroxymyristic acid was added to the N-terminal residue of the compounds, but no further modification was done in the product. It is not unthinkable that the actual natural products are further modified by other enzymes encoded in these BGCs (they contain a conserved amidohydrolase, an N-Acyltransferase and a MbtH protein, and sometimes a dehydrogenase). While Miranda-Casaluengo et al. [20] show that the expression of iupU is not controlled by iron, as is normally the case for siderophores, its deletion does affect growth of R. equi 103\u00a0s in low iron conditions when growing as a free-living organism. Of course, it remains very possible that IupU does synthesize a real, humimycin-like antibiotic: for example, one or more intermediates of the synthesis could be affecting the expression of rhequibactin, which would provide an alternative explanation for the low-iron phenotype of the knockout. Interestingly, yet another NRPS GCF, NRPS-5 (see Fig. 4), which is present in all R. erythropolis strains, has an NRPS with the same domain architecture as the humimycin NRPSs, but with different predicted substrates in modules 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7. This cluster also contains a long chain fatty acid CoA-ligase-encoding gene, as well as a mammalian cell entry (mce) operon. Further experimental studies will be needed to verify the natural physiological roles of each of these intriguing nonribosomal peptides.", "In the case of rhodochelin, further genes are involved in its biosynthesis, located outside this gene cluster [17]. This NRPS gene cluster thus is a good example of how very similar NRPS clusters can be responsible for the production of different molecules.

Many of these peptides are predicted to be rich in serine and threonine residues (see examples in Fig. 4), although these predictions may not be reliable given the distant relationship to any adenylation domains with known specificity. Rhodococcus strains seem to have a preference for lipopeptides formed by a C-starter domain or the combination of C-starter domain and an acyl CoA-ligase/synthetase, while Mycobacterium strains have a bigger proportion of clusters with a CoA-ligase and without C-starter domains (Fig. 5). Lipopeptides include antibiotics, such as daptomycin, the last major antibiotic that has been commercialized [58]. However, lipopeptides have other functions besides antibiotics: some function as surfactants, others display haemolytic activity [59] and still others play a role in establishing infection and/or biofilm formation [60]. They are formed from a cyclic oligopeptide, non-ribosomally synthesized, to which an acyl chain is attached [61]. These compounds are known to have different antimicrobial activity and toxicity depending on the length of the acyl chain. The acyl chain can be attached to the oligopeptide by different methods [62]: through a stand-alone acyl-carrier protein (ACP) and fatty acid ligase, as is the case of daptomycin, by a hybrid NRPS/PKS enzyme containing an ACP and fatty acid ligase domain as is the case for mycosubtilin, or by a specialized C-starter domain in the NRPS, as is the case for surfactin. In the case of the calcium-dependent antibiotic from Streptomyces species, the fatty acid is synthesized in a specific pathway (Fab enzymes encoded in the CDA gene cluster and enzymes from the primary metabolism), and is then attached to a stand-alone ACP that directly transfers the lipid to the condensation domain of the NRPS where it is attached to the peptide [63].

Strains were ordered according to their appearance in the 16S\u2013rRNA based phylogenetic tree. In cases of strains containing more than one 16S rRNA gene, they were checked for consistent signal and the first occurring 16S rRNA in each strain chromosome was used to generate the phylogenetic tree from the presence/absence map and the three R. opacus strains which have 44 to 45 BGCs.", "Additional files", "Additional files", "Additional file 1:Supplementary information.
