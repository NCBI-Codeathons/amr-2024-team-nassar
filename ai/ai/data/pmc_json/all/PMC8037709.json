["Actinomycetes are regarded as important sources for the generation of various bioactive secondary metabolites with rich chemical and bioactive diversities. Amycolatopsis falls under the rare actinomycete genus with the potential to produce antibiotics. In this review, all literatures were searched in the Web of Science, Google Scholar and PubMed up to March 2021. The keywords used in the search strategy were \u201cAmycolatopsis\u201d, \u201csecondary metabolite\u201d, \u201cnew or novel compound\u201d, \u201cbioactivity\u201d, \u201cbiosynthetic pathway\u201d and \u201cderivatives\u201d. The objective in this review is to summarize the chemical structures and biological activities of secondary metabolites from the genus Amycolatopsis. A total of 159 compounds derived from 8 known and 18 unidentified species are summarized in this paper. These secondary metabolites are mainly categorized into polyphenols, linear polyketides, macrolides, macrolactams, thiazolyl peptides, cyclic peptides, glycopeptides, amide and amino derivatives, glycoside derivatives, enediyne derivatives and sesquiterpenes. Meanwhile, they mainly showed unique antimicrobial, anti-cancer, antioxidant, anti-hyperglycemic, and enzyme inhibition activities. In addition, the biosynthetic pathways of several potent bioactive compounds and derivatives are included and the prospect of the chemical substances obtained from Amycolatopsis is also discussed to provide ideas for their implementation in the field of therapeutics and drug discovery.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Antibiotics produced by microorganisms have made a significant contribution to human health. Among them, Actinomycetes are the most important sources for drug lead compounds. However, researchers have been turned to rare Actinomycetes to develop novel antibiotics with the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria [1]. In 1986, Lechevalier et al. defined Amycolatopsis as a new genus to accommodate nocardioform Actinomycetes having type IV cell wall composition and lacking mycolic acids [2]. Up to now, by searching in the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature website (http://www.bacterio.net, accessed on 20 September 2020), this genus covered 94 verified species and 4 subspecies, and forms a unique branch in the evolutionary tree of Pseudonocardiaceae. Among 26 species covered in this review, most of them colonize in a wide variety of soil and a few species survival in terrestrial (insect, lichen, island, plant) and marine (sponge, sediment) environment.

The most notable antibiotics produced by Amycolatopsis strains include rifamycin [4] and vancomycin [5]. In the early 1950s, vancomycin had been first extracted from Amycolatopsis orientalis that was originally regarded as Streptomyces orientalis [6]. Vancomycin was introduced for clinical use in 1958 and sparsely used during the first 30 years of its introduction, due to its fewer advantages over semisynthetic antibiotics like penicillin, cephalosporin, lincomycin, and fluoroquinolones. Later, the complex chemical structure of vancomycin was ultimately described in 1983 [7]. The genes of OxyB, OxyA and OxyC, encoding three cytochrome P450 enzymes, have been proven to play an important role in three aromatic cross-links of vancomycin in that order [8]. The discovery of X-domain demonstrated the role of OxyA and OxyB, which introduce bisaryl ether linkages with the help of X-domain; however, the mechanism of final crosslink of the biaryl bond installed by OxyC has not been found yet [9]. In 1959, rifamycin was isolated from Amycolatopsis mediterranei, which was the first group of antimicrobials targeting RNA polymerase. The genes of RifZ and RifQ were crucial regulatory factors of rifamycin biosynthesis. RifZ directly regulated transcription of all operons within the rifamycin biosynthesis gene cluster [10]. RifQ inhibited the export of rifamycin B and inactivating it could increase the yield of rifamycin B without affecting the growth of the A. mediterranei [11]. The understanding of metabolite biosynthesis is helpful to the rational operation of biosynthetic pathways, so as to achieve the goal of producing new natural antibiotics. At present, there are few studies on the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites of Amycolatopsis [12]. We believe that outstanding bioactive compounds from Amycolatopsis deserve to be further researched on the mechanism of action, biosynthesis and regulatory genes. Some Amycolatopsis species have also been demonstrated to possess great potential in degrading plastics, treating heavy metals, and biotransformation. Herein, we describe a detailed summary about the chemical structures and bioactivities of secondary metabolites from Amycolatopsis reported during 1990\u20132020 by searching in the Web of Science, Google Scholar and PubMed. In addition, the biosynthetic pathways of several potent bioactive compounds and the derivatives of secondary metabolites via chemical synthesis, semi-synthesis and biosynthesis are also described in this paper.", "The genus Amycolatopsis is regarded as an important source of diverse valuable bioactive natural products covering many antibiotics [3].

Conclusions", "This review summarizes the various chemical structures and biological activities of 159 compounds isolated from Amycolatopsis species inhabiting soil, insects, lichen, islands, the marine and plants between 1990\u20132020. A total of 45 compounds possessed bioactivities, of which 32 compounds have glycosides and 31 compounds have cyclic skeletons. Thus, the novel compounds with glycosides and cyclic skeletons should be considered by researchers. For example, compound 51, the homolog of 49 and 50, lacked glycoside and showed 5- to 100-fold less cytotoxicity [26]. The multitudinous secondary metabolites of the genus Amycolatopsis represent great research value and deserve further investigation. On the other hand, the genus of Amycolatosis could metabolize a variety of carbon sources and grow in a wide temperature range, which provides the possibility for them to become important biotechnological tools. It has been proven that this genus has great potential in degrading plastics, treating heavy metals, and biotransformation [68]. More researches are needed to transform these potentials into applications to solve practical problems to benefit mankind.", "This review summarizes the various chemical structures and biological activities of 159 compounds isolated from Amycolatopsis species inhabiting soil, insects, lichen, islands, the marine and plants between 1990\u20132020.

However, people are more willing to study the biosynthesis and mechanism of action of vancomycin, rifamycin and their derivatives. There are relatively fewer studies on the biosynthesis of other bioactive compounds and more attention is needed to be paid to researchers. In the course of the biosynthetic pathway study, a series of tools, for example, antiSMASH [90] or PRISM [91], have been fully exploited, which could derive a prediction of natural products, including the enzymes, regulatory genes and biosynthetic genes et al. through the genome sequencing results. We could also use these tools to reveal sufficiently more silent biosynthetic gene clusters and uncover more and more new interesting bioactive natural products. The biosynthetic potency of Amycolatopsis species is evidenced to be massive and this genus possesses many silent biosynthetic gene clusters waiting to be found [92]. Recently, Pan et al. obtained two new compounds, amycolapeptins A and B by combined-cultivating two strains of Amycoaltopsis sp. 26-4 and Tsukamurella pulmonis TP-B0596 for the first time, while they could not be discovered in a monoculture of Amycoaltopsis sp. 26-4 [93], which provided a new path for the cultivation of Amycolatopsis.", "The study of biosynthetic pathway is a crucial process for excavating bioactive natural products.

Most of all, the mechanism of action and biosynthetic regulatory genes of potent active compounds deserve to be deeply explored since they could determine the utility value of these compounds. Derivatives sometimes tend to have stronger activity so that more study might be focused on the structural modification of secondary metabolites for providing more analogues to be screened for antibiotics. In addition, compounds with excellent bioactivity that have been discovered should be solved for mass production due to their promising medicinal application. The potential ecological effects of Amycolatopsis species should be also taken seriously. The environmental pollution problem might be solved in some ways by thoroughly excavating the biofunction of the strains.
