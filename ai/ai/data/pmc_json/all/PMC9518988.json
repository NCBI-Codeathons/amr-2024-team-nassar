["Abstract", "Chaetoglobosin A is a complex macrocyclic alkaloid with potent antimycotic, antiparasitic and antitumor properties. However, the low output and high cost of chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis have hampered the application and commercialization of chaetoglobosin A in agriculture and biomedicine. Here, the CgMfs1 gene, which encodes the major facilitator superfamily secondary transporter, was identified based on bioinformatics analysis, and an intensive study of its effects on chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis and secretion was performed using CgMfs1\u2010silencing and CgMfs1\u2010overexpression strategies. Inactivation of CgMfs1 caused a notable decrease in chaetoglobosin A yield from 58.66\u2009mg/L to 19.95\u2009mg/L (MFS1\u20133) and 17.13\u2009mg/L (MFS1\u20134). The use of an efficient expression plasmid in Chaetomium globosum W7 to generate the overexpression mutant OEX13 resulted in the highest chaetoglobosin A increase to 298.77\u2009mg/L. Interestingly, the transcription level of the polyketide synthase gene significantly fluctuated with the change in CgMfs1, confirming that the predicted efflux gene CgMfs1 could play a crucial role in chaetoglobosin A transportation. Effective efflux of chaetoglobosin A could possibly alleviate feedback inhibition, resulting in notable increase in the expression of the polyketide synthase gene. Furthermore, we utilized cornstalk as the fermentation substrate to produce chaetoglobosin A, and scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform\u2010infrared spectroscopy revealed that the strain OEX13 could well degrade cornstalk, presenting significant increases in the chaetoglobosin A yield, when compared with that produced by the wild\u2010type strain (from 40.32 to 191.90\u2009mg/L). Thus, this research provides a novel analogous engineering strategy for the construction of high\u2010yielding strain and offers new insight into large\u2010scale chaetoglobosin A production.", "In this work, a gene named as CgMfs1, which encodes the major facilitator superfamily secondary transporter, has been identified based on the bioinformatics analysis. CgMfs1\u2010silencing and CgMfs1\u2010overexpression strategies have been developed to intensive study of its effects on chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis and secretion. In addition, our attempt to employ the optimal overexpression mutant OEX13 to produce chaetoglobosin A and cornstalk was used as the unique substrate. This research provided a new insight for studying the secondary metabolites of the genus of Chaetomium. More importantly, cornstalk resources to generate bioactive substances, which with the high economic value, will become a new direction of future development.", "Zhao, S.\n, \nLin, C.\n, \nCheng, M.\n, \nZhang, K.\n, \nWang, Z.\n, \nZhao, T.\n et al.

Although members of this family share a similar feature in structure, they can be divided into five subunits based on variations in their size and substitution pattern connected to the perhydro\u2010isoindolone scaffold as follows: cytochalasins, pyrichalasins, chaetoglobosins, aspochalasins and alachalasins (Scherlach et al.,\u00a02010). Chaetoglobosin A, the most abundant member of this family, was first reported in 1973 (Seklta et al.,\u00a01973) and is predominantly biosynthesized by the biological control species Chaetomium globosum. Its major, and most well\u2010known, distinctive inhibitory activity is against the phytopathogenic fungi Fusarium sporotrichioides, Setosphaeria turcica and Rhizopus stolonifer (Jiang et al.,\u00a02017; Zhang et al.,\u00a02013a, 2013b, 2013c); and plant parasitic nematodes Meloidogyne incognita (Hu et al.,\u00a02013). Besides, chaetoglobosin A has also been noted to exhibit potent cytotoxicity in tumour cells A549 and HepG2 (Zhang et al.,\u00a02021). Owing to its significant research and commercial importance, many investigators have successively analysed chaetoglobosin A. For instance, by using RNA\u2010mediated gene\u2010silencing technology, the gene cluster responsible for chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis has been predicted and identified in Penicillium expansum (Sch\u00fcmann & Hertweck,\u00a02007). Besides, it has been reported that acetate and malonate are the starting compounds for chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis, and that PKS\u2010NRPS hybrid synthase is responsible for polymerization of the monomeric substance to form the carbon backbone. Furthermore, a stand\u2010alone enoyl reductase (ER) located downstream of the gene cluster, which functions as a chaperone protein, has been noted to have an extremely crucial effect on carbon\u2010chain elongation (Ishiuchi et al.,\u00a02013). Furthermore, intramolecular Diels\u2010Alder cyclization of an earlier precursor prochaetoglobosin I has been identified to be an important step in chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis (Cox & Simpson,\u00a02009). Moreover, three redox enzymes, including one FAD\u2010dependent monooxygenase and two cytochrome P450 oxygenases, have been found to transform the nascent substrate into terminal product chaetoglobosin A (Ishiuchi et al.,\u00a02013). In the past 5\u2009years, our research group conducted stepwise investigation of the factors influencing chaetoglobosin A production. A global regulator CgLaeA was identified, which positively regulated the expression of pathway\u2010specific transcription and negatively adjusted another regulator CgVelB, and increased the chaetoglobosin A yield from 52.0 up to 79.6\u00a0mg/L (Cheng et al.,\u00a02021a). Furthermore, a GAL4\u2010like Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor CgCheR was detected in C. globosum, which was found to play a critical role in chaetoglobosin A production, increasing the target product titre by five\u2010fold, when compared with that noted in the parent cell (Cheng et al.,\u00a02021b). Jiang et al.,\u00a0(2017) attempted to utilize cornstalk as the fermentation matrix instead of the traditional medium to produce it and obtained 0.34\u2009mg/g chaetoglobosin A. Although chaetoglobosin A has shown diversiform application potential in plant protection, the low output and high cost of fermentation still limit its widespread applications in agriculture. To overcome this problem, improvement of chaetoglobosin A producing capacity of C. globosum and selection of an economical substrate are crucial.", "Cytochalasans, a large group of secondary metabolites catalysed and synthesized by polyketide\u2010non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS\u2010NRPS) (Skellam,\u00a02017), exhibit a broad range of biological activities such as phytotoxic (cytochalasin B and chaetoglobosin K) (Cutler et al.,\u00a01980), antitumor (periconiasins A\u2013C) (Zhang et al.,\u00a02013a, 2013b, 2013c), antifouling (Zheng et al.,\u00a02013) and immunomodulatory (Chaetoglobosin Fex) activities (Dou et al.,\u00a02011).

These results suggested that the CgMfs1 gene is not involved in the regulation of morphological development. In addition, to clarify the changes in the chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis in CgMfs1\u2010inactive mutants, the key enzymes genes such as polyketide synthase (CgPKS, Protein Accession No. CAO91861), enoyl reductase (CgER, Protein Accession No. CAO91860), cytochrome P450 oxygenase (CgP450, Protein Accession No. CAO91862) and FAD\u2010dependent monooxygenase (CgFMO, Protein Accession No. CAO91863) involved in chaetoglobosin A biosynthetic pathway (Figure S5) were examined by quantitative real\u2010time PCR (qRT\u2010PCR).

At 12\u2009days of fermentation, the transcription of CgMfs1, CgPKS, CgP450, CgFMO and CgER in MFS1\u20133 was reduced to 0.36, 0.65, 0.90, 0.88 and 0.79, and to 0.29, 0.52, 0.86, 0.76 and 0.75 in MFS1\u20134, respectively, when compared with that observed in the wild\u2010type strain.

During the fermentation process, samples were collected every 3\u2009days, and the relative expression levels of each transcript were calculated using 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT formula, considering the expression level of each gene of the parental strain C. globosum W7 (incubated in PDA medium for 6\u2009days) as 1.0 (Figure\u00a03). As expected, transcription of CgMfs1 was markedly decreased in the mutants at all the tested time points, whereas that in SC1\u20131 and wild\u2010type strain was similar. Moreover, CgPKS, which is responsible for the carbon skeleton synthesis of chaetoglobosin A (Ishiuchi et al.,\u00a02013), was also found to be significantly reduced in the mutants. At 12\u2009days of fermentation, the transcription of CgMfs1, CgPKS, CgP450, CgFMO and CgER in MFS1\u20133 was reduced to 0.36, 0.65, 0.90, 0.88 and 0.79, and to 0.29, 0.52, 0.86, 0.76 and 0.75 in MFS1\u20134, respectively, when compared with that observed in the wild\u2010type strain. These findings implied that efficient silencing of CgMfs1 in the engineered strains possibly influenced the transcription of chaetoglobosin A biosynthesis related genes.", "CgMfs1\u2010pSL2 was transformed by utilizing polyethylene glycol (PEG) mediated protoplasts transformation. A total of eight independent hygromycin\u2010resistant colonies were separated, and SC1\u20131 (derived from pSilent\u2010SCL1 transformation) and wild\u2010type C. globosum W7 were used as control. First, the integrated hairpin structure was identified by diagnostic PCR, and a 1242\u2010bp silencing cassette was amplified with the flank primers (pSF and pSR) of the seven mutants and reference strain SC1\u20131, whereas no fragment of the wild\u2010type strain was amplified (Figure S3), confirming that the mutants has a complete hairpin structure that can be used to achieve gene silencing. Furthermore, to test the influence of CgMfs1 interference on chaetoglobosin A production, the seven mutants and the parental strain were cultivated in potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium for 9\u2009days at 28\u00b0C. The fermentation broth was treated as described in the experimental procedures and the samples were analysed by high\u2010performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Two of the seven pure separated mutants, namely, MFS1\u20133 and MFS1\u20134, presented a significant decrease in the yield of chaetoglobosin A, with the reduction percentages reaching 73.54% and 80.40%, respectively (Figure S4A). Subsequently, morphological characteristics of the optimal mutants were further examined by cultivating the mutants in PDA medium for 14\u2009days at 28\u00b0C and observing them under optical microscope and SEM. The aerial hyphae and substrate mycelium of all the examined strains were well developed and distinctly verrucose with 2.6\u20133.3\u00a0\u03bcm diameter. Olivaceous\u2010brown, irregularly arranged, non\u2010motile, ovoid and one\u2010celled spores (8.8\u20139.5\u2009\u00d7\u20097.0\u20137.6\u00a0\u03bcm) with a smooth surface on aerial mycelium were noted (Figure\u00a02A), which revealed that the mutant strains exhibited representative traits of the genus Chaetomium (Lodha,\u00a01964), with no differences between the reference strain and CgMfs1\u2010silenced mutants.

These results suggested that unlike the structural gene of the biosynthetic cluster and global regulator, the transporter gene CgMfs1 has no significant effect on cellular development (Cheng et al.,\u00a02021a, 2021b; Hu et al.,\u00a02012). In addition, green fluorescence signals (Figure\u00a04A) corresponding to EGFP\u2010CgMfs1 were coincident as inferred, confirming that the fluorescent protein gene had been integrated into the genome of the target cells and correctly expressed. Moreover, to further examine the impact of CgMfs1 overexpression on the transcription of its targets, the expression of four genes involved in chaetoglobosin A biosynthetic cluster, namely, CgPKS, CgER, CgP450 and CgFMO, was examined at different time points. For this purpose, the RNA samples were extracted from the mycelia of the candidate strains cultivated for various days (6, 9, 12 and 15\u2009days), and the relative expression levels were tested by qRT\u2010PCR. The results showed that transcription of CgMfs1 was obviously improved in the mutants at all the tested time points, whereas that in the vector control was similar to the CgMfs1 transcription in the parent strain (Figure\u00a05).

As the CgPKS gene is most likely to catalyse the first crucial step of chaetoglobosin A production (Ishiuchi et al.,\u00a02013), this transcription pattern of CgPKS might possibly be another reason for the higher levels of chaetoglobosin A in the mutants, when compared with those in the reference strains. Meanwhile, the transcription levels of CgER and CgP450 were also observed to be higher in the CgMfs1\u2010overexpressing mutants, when compared with those in the control strains, which could be owing to the fact that CgER and CgP450 are necessary for extending the carbon framework and modifying the precursors of chaetoglobosin A (Ishiuchi et al.,\u00a02013).", "To confirm the assumption that CgMfs1 is involved in chaetoglobosin A transport, the expression of CgMfs1 was enhanced by using a strong promoter gpdA in C. globosum W7.

Interestingly, the transcription of CgPKS was up to 2.51\u2010, 2.89\u2010 and 2.59\u2010fold higher in the mutants at 12\u2009days, when compared with that in the wild\u2010type and vector control strains, respectively. As the CgPKS gene is most likely to catalyse the first crucial step of chaetoglobosin A production (Ishiuchi et al.,\u00a02013), this transcription pattern of CgPKS might possibly be another reason for the higher levels of chaetoglobosin A in the mutants, when compared with those in the reference strains. Meanwhile, the transcription levels of CgER and CgP450 were also observed to be higher in the CgMfs1\u2010overexpressing mutants, when compared with those in the control strains, which could be owing to the fact that CgER and CgP450 are necessary for extending the carbon framework and modifying the precursors of chaetoglobosin A (Ishiuchi et al.,\u00a02013).", "To confirm the assumption that CgMfs1 is involved in chaetoglobosin A transport, the expression of CgMfs1 was enhanced by using a strong promoter gpdA in C. globosum W7. Figure S6 shows the design and construction of the integrative plasmid pBARGPE1\u2010CgMfs1\u2010OE6 that was used to improve CgMfs1 expression. The CgMfs1\u2010overexpressing carrier pBARGPE1\u2010CgMfs1\u2010OE6 and empty vector pBARGPE1\u2010EGFP were introduced into the protoplasts of C. globosum W7, and various transformants were selected based on their ability to grow in hygromycin\u2010supplemented medium. Diagnostic PCR assay of all the isolates, using the primers OEXEG\u2010F and OEXEG\u2010R to confirm accurate integration of CgMfs1 overexpression cassette, detected a 1851\u2010bp sequence in 10 independent mutants (Figure S6D). Subsequently, these 10 candidates were incubated in PDA medium for 9\u2009days at 28\u00b0C and the fermentation broth was preprocessed and investigated for chaetoglobosin A production. As expected, chaetoglobosin A production of most of the isolates was increased at varying degrees; in particular, OEX1, OEX13 and OEX19 showed 226.06%, 444.97% and 228.38% increases in chaetoglobosin A production, respectively (Figure S4B). Subsequently, the phenotypic properties of the optimal CgMfs1\u2010overexpressing strains were further examined by incubating the strains in PDA medium for 14\u2009days at 28\u00b0C and observing the colonies under a light microscope, standard electron microscope and fluorescence microscope. As shown in Figure\u00a04A, the colony diameter, aerial hyphae diameter, shape and size of the spores of the CgMfs1\u2010overexpressing strains remained unchanged, when compared with those of the parental strain and the control isolate pB\u2010CK1. These results suggested that unlike the structural gene of the biosynthetic cluster and global regulator, the transporter gene CgMfs1 has no significant effect on cellular development (Cheng et al.,\u00a02021a, 2021b; Hu et al.,\u00a02012). In addition, green fluorescence signals (Figure\u00a04A) corresponding to EGFP\u2010CgMfs1 were coincident as inferred, confirming that the fluorescent protein gene had been integrated into the genome of the target cells and correctly expressed. Moreover, to further examine the impact of CgMfs1 overexpression on the transcription of its targets, the expression of four genes involved in chaetoglobosin A biosynthetic cluster, namely, CgPKS, CgER, CgP450 and CgFMO, was examined at different time points. For this purpose, the RNA samples were extracted from the mycelia of the candidate strains cultivated for various days (6, 9, 12 and 15\u2009days), and the relative expression levels were tested by qRT\u2010PCR. The results showed that transcription of CgMfs1 was obviously improved in the mutants at all the tested time points, whereas that in the vector control was similar to the CgMfs1 transcription in the parent strain (Figure\u00a05).

As the CgPKS gene is most likely to catalyse the first crucial step of chaetoglobosin A production (Ishiuchi et al.,\u00a02013), this transcription pattern of CgPKS might possibly be another reason for the higher levels of chaetoglobosin A in the mutants, when compared with those in the reference strains.

By using the C. globosum genome, the present study analysed the function of a putative MFS efflux pump adjacent to the chaetoglobosin A cluster, which was annotated as CgMfs1. The results of transmembrane and hydropathy profile demonstrated that CgMfs1 comprised 12 TMS, similar to the typical configurations of DHA12 involved in secondary metabolites transport (Paulsen et al.,\u00a01996; Reddy et al.,\u00a02012). Target disruption of pfmfr3, a novel mitochondrial transporter in Plasmodium falciparum has been reported to decrease the sensitivity of the parasite to antimalarial compounds (Rocamora et al.,\u00a02021), and mutants overexpressing an MFS transporter PdMfs1 in Penicillium digitatum have been noted to be more resistant to imazalil (Wang et al.,\u00a02012). Furthermore, interruption of the expression level of the novel MFS transporter gene penM via gene\u2010silencing strategy led to a marked decrease in benzylpenicillin production; by contrast, overexpression of the target gene by the efficiently expressed promoter increased the yield and promoted the biosynthetic of benzylpenicillin (Fernandez\u2010Aguado et al.,\u00a02014). These results are consistent with the findings of the present study, which revealed that inactivation of the efflux pump gene CgMfs1 directly caused a significant decline in chaetoglobosin A output from 58.66 to 19.95\u2009mg/L (MFS1\u20133) and 17.13\u2009mg/L (MFS1\u20134) during the equilibrium period of fermentation. On the contrary, chaetoglobosin A production by CgMfs1\u2010overexpressing strains evidently improved by 4.8\u2010fold (OEX13), when compared with that by the wild\u2010type strain, which proved that the predicted efflux gene CgMfs1 may play a crucial role in chaetoglobosin A transportation.

The chaetoglobosin A production by OEX13 was significantly improved by 475.94% (from 40.32 to 191.90\u2009mg/L), and a further enhancement in the chaetoglobosin A yield could possibly be achieved by straw pretreatment and humidity adjustment (Wang et al.,\u00a02020).", "In summary, the present work ascertained a novel unidentified MFS efflux gene, which had a crucial effect on chaetoglobosin A transportation and provided new insights for studying secondary metabolites of the genus of Chaetomium. In future, production of bioactive substances with high economic value from agricultural residues will be an important waste management strategy as well as a novel research direction for reducing fermentation costs and accomplishing commercial production.", "In summary, the present work ascertained a novel unidentified MFS efflux gene, which had a crucial effect on chaetoglobosin A transportation and provided new insights for studying secondary metabolites of the genus of Chaetomium.
