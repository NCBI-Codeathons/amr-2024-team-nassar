["Genomics-guided methodologies have revolutionized the discovery of natural products. However, a major challenge in the field of genome mining is determining how to selectively extract biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for untapped natural products from numerous available genome sequences. In this study, we developed a fungal genome mining tool that extracts BGCs encoding enzymes that lack a detectable protein domain (i.e., domainless enzymes) and are not recognized as biosynthetic proteins by existing bioinformatic tools. We searched for BGCs encoding a homologue of Pyr4-family terpene cyclases, which are representative examples of apparently domainless enzymes, in approximately 2000 fungal genomes and discovered several BGCs with unique features. The subsequent characterization of selected BGCs led to the discovery of fungal onoceroid triterpenoids and unprecedented onoceroid synthases. Furthermore, in addition to the onoceroids, a previously unreported sesquiterpene hydroquinone, of which the biosynthesis involves a Pyr4-family terpene cyclase, was obtained. Our genome mining tool has broad applicability in fungal genome mining and can serve as a beneficial platform for accessing diverse, unexploited natural products.", "Tang et al. describe the development of a fungal genome mining tool which can be used to identify biosynthetic gene clusters from fungal genomes that lack detectable protein domains and demonstrate its functionality.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Recent years have witnessed an exponential increase in data accumulation across all fields, ushering us into the era of big data.

To facilitate genome mining in fungi, several bioinformatic tools, such as antiSMASH9, SMURF10, DeepBGC11, and TOUCAN12, can be employed to detect BGCs in a specific fungal genome. Among the available tools, antiSMASH has gained the most popularity, possibly because of its user-friendly online platform and versatile functions. However, some challenges have been encountered while using antiSMASH for BGC detection and genome mining. First, antiSMASH classifies many genes as other genes, even when they encode a biosynthetic enzyme. For example, when antiSMASH (version 7.0.0) was employed to analyze the BGC of the fungal meroterpenoid novofumigatonin13, a hybrid molecule of polyketide and terpenoid origin, it categorized 6 out of 13 genes as other genes. This may be because some of these genes lacked a detectable Pfam domain14 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). Moreover, one of these six overlooked genes encodes the terpene cyclase NvfL, which has widely distributed homologues in natural product pathways15. Thus, although antiSMASH should theoretically categorize this BGC as \u201cT1PKS, terpene\u201d (type I polyketide synthase + terpene synthase), it recognized only T1PKS. In addition, these enzymes without a detectable protein domain (hereafter termed domainless enzymes) included the \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase NvfI and the methyltransferase NvfJ, indicating that antiSMASH failed to recognize various biosynthetic proteins. Furthermore, although antiSMASH and the other aforementioned tools can be used to extract all possible BGCs from a genome sequence, they do not facilitate the selective extraction of BGCs with a desired or specific feature. Thus, users need to select BGCs based on the criteria set for subsequent wet lab experiments.

We demonstrated that our genome mining tool could effectively identify BGCs for previously undiscovered natural products. The onoceroid BGCs characterized in this study could also be identified using antiSMASH; however, the BGCs extracted by antiSMASH contained substantially more genes outside the boundary of a BGC than those extracted in this study (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). In addition, antiSMASH could not detect the presence of pyr4-like genes in these BGCs. Alternatively, these BGCs could be discovered by standard BLAST search using Pyr4 as a query and subsequent manual investigation of the flanking regions of each identified pyr4-like gene, which, however, requires tedious procedures and might take weeks to months for completion. Therefore, the onoceroid BGCs would not have been effectively discovered using antiSMASH or conventional genome mining methodologies. On the other hand, our genome mining tool has allowed the automated extraction and visualization of all possible BGCs encoding a Pyr4 homologue from approximately 2000 fungal genomes within a single day, which also facilitated the selection of BGCs with unusual features.

Onoceroids have been isolated from bacteria52, ferns53, higher plants54,55, and animals56. However, to the best of our knowledge, onoceroids have never been isolated from fungi. Thus, the present study provides landmark examples of fungal onoceroids and their biosynthetic pathways. In terms of the biosynthesis of onoceroids, BmeTC from the bacterium Bacillus megaterium was the initial onoceroid synthase characterized in 2013, and this enzyme solely transforms squalene into onoceroids52. In the fern Lycopodium clavatum, a pair of homologous enzymes (LCC and LCD or LCE) convert oxidosqualene into onoceroid species57,58. These known enzymes for onoceroid biosynthesis are all homologous to SHCs and OSCs. In contrast, the biosynthesis of fungal onoceroids requires two families of terpene cyclases (i.e., SHC/OSC-like enzyme and Pyr4-family terpene cyclase), introducing an unprecedented biosynthetic mechanism of onoceroids. This study demonstrated that Pyr4-family terpene cyclases are also involved in the biosynthesis of pure (not mero-) terpenoids. The majority of fungal triterpenoids are synthesized through the cyclization of oxidosqualene59\u201361, and hexaprenyl pyrophosphate is known to serve as the precursor of a few fungal triterpenoids62. However, the fungal onoceroid pathways identified in this study represent rare examples in which squalene is directly cyclized to produce fungal triterpenoids.", "In our global fungal genome mining study, we discovered three types of onoceroids, which are triterpenoids synthesized from squalene or oxidosqualene through cyclization at both ends of the prenyl chain.

Thus, the present study provides landmark examples of fungal onoceroids and their biosynthetic pathways. In terms of the biosynthesis of onoceroids, BmeTC from the bacterium Bacillus megaterium was the initial onoceroid synthase characterized in 2013, and this enzyme solely transforms squalene into onoceroids52. In the fern Lycopodium clavatum, a pair of homologous enzymes (LCC and LCD or LCE) convert oxidosqualene into onoceroid species57,58. These known enzymes for onoceroid biosynthesis are all homologous to SHCs and OSCs. In contrast, the biosynthesis of fungal onoceroids requires two families of terpene cyclases (i.e., SHC/OSC-like enzyme and Pyr4-family terpene cyclase), introducing an unprecedented biosynthetic mechanism of onoceroids. This study demonstrated that Pyr4-family terpene cyclases are also involved in the biosynthesis of pure (not mero-) terpenoids. The majority of fungal triterpenoids are synthesized through the cyclization of oxidosqualene59\u201361, and hexaprenyl pyrophosphate is known to serve as the precursor of a few fungal triterpenoids62. However, the fungal onoceroid pathways identified in this study represent rare examples in which squalene is directly cyclized to produce fungal triterpenoids.", "The biosynthetic pathways of fungal onoceroids discovered in this study can be proposed as follows (Fig.\u00a05). The biosynthesis of homomonoceroid A (4) begins with squalene being cyclized into \u03b1-polypodatetraene (1) by the squalene cyclase HomoS through the carbocationic intermediate 14. Subsequently, the FMO HomoM epoxidizes the terminal olefin of 1 to yield epoxide 15, which was not isolated in this study. The Pyr4-family terpene cyclase HomoB then protonates epoxide 15 to initiate the second round of cyclization, and the resulting tetracyclic carbocationic species 16 is neutralized by a water attack, yielding 4. In addition, the bicyclic intermediate 15 is involved in the biosynthesis of fumionoceroid C (7), where FumiB accepts 15 to produce a differently cyclized product fumionoceroid A (5). FumiB first cyclizes 15 into the carbocationic intermediate 17. Instead of being quenched by water, the reaction concludes with a 1,2-hydride shift, 1,2-methyl shift, and deprotonation from C-19. Subsequently, the P450 FumiP hydroxylates 5 at C-24 to complete the biosynthesis. Oxidosqualene can also be accepted by Fumi enzymes, except for FumiP, to produce the C-3 hydroxy analogue of 5, fumionoceroid B (6), through \u03b1-polypodatetraen-3\u03b2-ol (2) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). Meanwhile, the biosynthetic pathway leading to alliaonoceroid D (11) branches from the other two pathways in the first step. AlliS transforms squalene into 8\u03b1-hydroxypolypoda-13,17,21-triene (3) instead of 1. After the epoxidation of 3 by AlliM to yield 18, which was not obtained in our work, AlliB cyclizes 18 into alliaonoceroid A (8). The cyclization mode followed by AlliB is similar to that employed by HomoB, but the AlliB-catalyzed reaction uses the C-8 hydroxy group instead of a water molecule to produce the pentacyclic onoceroid 8. Compound 8 then undergoes acetylation at the C-21 hydroxy group; this reaction is catalyzed by the acetyltransferase AlliA, yielding alliaonoceroid C (10). The P450 AlliP then installs a hydroxy group at C-16 to produce 19, which is again acetylated by AlliA to yield the end product 11. In the absence of AlliA, AlliP might cause the hydroxylation of 3 at C-6 to yield a shunt pathway product 19, which is then oxidized by an endogenous enzyme of A. oryzae to give alliaonoceroid B (9) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). The three characterized fungal onoceroid pathways suggest that fungi synthesize diverse onoceroids due to various factors affecting structural diversification, such as the (i) cyclization mode of (oxido)squalene, (ii) the reaction mechanisms of Pyr4-family terpene cyclases, and (iii) tailoring reactions. The characterization of other onoceroid BGCs not examined in this study or the construction of artificial pathways with onoceroid biosynthetic genes from different pathways can further expand the molecular diversity of fungal onoceroids.Fig. 5Proposed biosynthetic pathways of the onoceroids obtained in this study.Predicted biosynthetic/reaction intermediates are shown in brackets.", "The biosynthetic pathways of fungal onoceroids discovered in this study can be proposed as follows (Fig.\u00a05).

The major product from the mos cluster, moserinol (12), was determined to be a previously unreported molecule, further demonstrating the utility of our genome mining tool in accessing unexploited compounds. Unfortunately, 12 lacks a structural novelty, as its diastereomers, yahazunol and ent-yahazunol (13), have already been isolated from nature46,63. However, these two compounds have been obtained from a brown alga and a sponge, respectively, and, to the best of our knowledge, these sesquiterpene hydroquinones, and their analogues, have never been reported from fungi. In addition, although 4-HBA is a precursor for diverse meroterpenoids both from primary and secondary metabolism, such as ubiquinones64, xiamenmycin65, and biscognienyneB45, our study provides an intriguing example in which a Pyr4-family terpene cyclase is involved in the biosynthesis of 4-HBA-derived meroterpenoids. Although the complete biosynthetic pathway of 12 and the functions of each Mos protein await to be elucidated in future studies, the biosynthetic route to 12 could be proposed as follows (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). Initially, the UbiA-like prenyltransferase MosC farnesylates 4-HBA, which is followed by the oxidative decarboxylation by the FMO MosD. Subsequently, the terpene cyclase MosB cyclizes the farnesyl moiety, in which the cyclization is completed by the attack of a water molecule from both sides, resulting in the formation of a pair of epimers, 12 and 13.
