["Understanding the driving forces and intrinsic mechanisms of microbial competition is a fundamental question in microbial ecology. Despite the well-established negative correlation between exploitation competition and phylogenetic distance, the process of interference competition that is exemplified by antagonism remains controversial. Here, we studied the genus Bacillus, a commonly recognized producer of multifarious antibiotics, to explore the role of phylogenetic patterns of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in mediating the relationship between antagonism and phylogeny. Comparative genomic analysis revealed a positive association between BGC distance and phylogenetic distance. Antagonistic tests demonstrated that the inhibition phenotype positively correlated with both phylogenetic and predicted BGC distance, especially for antagonistic strains possessing abundant BGCs. Mutant-based verification showed that the antagonism was dependent on the BGCs that specifically harbored by the antagonistic strain. These findings highlight that BGC-phylogeny coherence regulates the positive correlation between congeneric antagonism and phylogenetic distance, which deepens our understanding of the driving force and intrinsic mechanism of microbial interactions.", "Interference competition exemplified by antagonism remains controversial. Using comparative genomic analysis and antagonistic assessments, this study shows that the distribution profile of biosynthetic gene clusters within Bacillus genomes is consistent with their phylogenetic relationship and that congeneric antagonism among Bacillus strains is positively correlated with phylogenetic distance.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Microbes are naturally surrounded by taxonomically different ones with which they compete for scarce resources and space1. Competition between different species is generally categorized as exploitation competition, which involves the rapid consumption of a limited resource2,3, and interference competition, which refers to direct antagonistic interactions4. Microbial antagonism is driven by diverse toxins, such as broad-spectrum antibiotics and strain-specific bacteriocins5,6, and is recognized as a key element regulating populations and determining their success within diverse communities7. The stunning diversity of both the categories and functions of antimicrobial metabolites among different species, results in the extraordinary complexity of interference competition between microbes with different phylogenetic relationships4,8.

Despite the well-established negative correlation between exploitation competition and phylogenetic distance2, the process of interference competition is much more complicated and remains controversial. Russel et al. demonstrated that inhibition was more prevalent between closely related bacteria, and this negative correlation between antagonism and phylogeny was mediated by the overlap of the metabolic niche among different strains9. Conversely, other studies examined congeneric competition in Vibrio and Streptomyces and revealed that closely related strains competed less than phylogenetically distant strains, which was probably caused by the effect of the prior coexistence and distribution of secondary metabolites in different genomes7,10,11. Additionally, the positive relationship between kin discrimination and phylogeny was indicated within Bacillus subtilis, which was modulated by genes involved in antimicrobials and cell-surface modifiers12,13; however, this correlation was lost or even became a certain extent negative when more distantly Bacillus strains were tested for antagonism, probably being dependent on the demand of protecting public goods14. Taken together, the relationship between antagonism and phylogenetic distance with regard to microbes from different taxonomical scales or groups, as well as the involved biological mechanism, is still under debate, which limits both our understanding and application of these microbial interactions.", "Phylogenetic relatedness is considered to be closely associated with microbial competition, based on its determination of both primary and secondary metabolic profiles2,4.

Here, we hypothesize that the correlation between BGC and phylogenetic distance can predict the pattern of congeneric antagonism among different taxonomic groups, as strains possessing higher BGC similarity should have a lower probability of inhibiting each other. To test this hypothesis, we referred to the Gram-positive Bacillus as the target genus, which is a commonly recognized producer of multifarious secondary metabolites16,19,22\u201325, including nonribosomal lipopeptides (e.g., surfactin, iturin, and fengycin families produced by various species)23, nonribosomal polyketides (e.g., difficidin and macrolactin produced by B. amyloliquefaciens and B. velezensis)19, peptide-polyketide hybrid compound (e.g., zwittermicin produced by B. cereus and B. thuringiensis)24, and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs; e.g., lichenicidin produced by B. licheniformis)26.

Correspondingly, the antagonistic abilities of B. thuringiensis YX7 and B. mobilis XL40 (cereus clade) towards other Bacillus strains were also enhanced with increasing phylogenetic distance (Fig.\u00a03c, d, P\u2009=\u20090.007 and P\u2009=\u20090.008, respectively). Based on the results of the colony confrontation assays, a significant positive correlation between antagonism and phylogenetic distance was revealed (Fig.\u00a03e, P\u2009=\u20097.338\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221215, R2\u2009=\u20090.1427). To further clarify whether this association was mediated by the BGC distribution pattern, we calculated the predicted BGC distance among all the tested paired strains (for strains whose genomes have not been completely sequenced, we referred to the Bacillus genomes in the NCBI database that shared the highest 16\u2009S rRNA similarity). Interestingly, there was also a significant positive correlation between antagonism and the predicted BGC distance (Fig.\u00a03f, P\u2009=\u20091.971\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221211, R2\u2009=\u20090.1076), suggesting that BGC profiling is likely to play a role in regulating interspecies antagonism.Fig. 3Colony antagonism phenotype is positively correlated with the phylogenetic and BGC distance within Bacillus species.a\u2013d Inhibition of colonies of B. amyloliquefaciens ACCC19745, B. pumilus ACCC04450, B. thuringiensis YX7, and B. mobilis XL40 against Bacillus from different clades.

Here, we expanded the antagonistic strains to 17 species covering all four phylogenetic clades (Supplementary Data\u00a07). The extracellular metabolites of antagonistic bacteria also generally showed stronger inhibition to distantly related strains than to closely related strains; this pattern was particularly clear for antagonistic strains in the subtilis clade, which harbored the most BGCs (Fig.\u00a04a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06).

This finding suggests that the antagonistic bacteria carrying abundant BGCs (e.g., >10) tend to have a clear positive correlation between inhibition phenotype and phylogenetic distance, while those with fewer BGCs (e.g., <8) show a weak or even irregular antagonistic pattern against diverse targets. Furthermore, the BGC-phylogeny coherence was similar among all the antagonistic strains (no significant relevance with BGCs No.; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08, P\u2009=\u20090.4201, R2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.01994), while the antagonism-BGC distance correlation revealed a positive association with the quantity of BGCs in bacteria (i.e., bacteria having fewer BGCs showed a weak antagonism-BGC distance relevance, and vice versa.; Fig.\u00a04e, P\u2009=\u20090.0494, R2\u2009=\u20090.1824), which can partially explain the weak correlation between antagonism and phylogenetic distance in strains possessing fewer BGCs.Fig. 4Congeneric inhibition by fermentation supernatants is positively correlated with the phylogenetic and BGC distance in Bacillus.a Heatmap showing the antagonistic profiles of the fermentation supernatant of 17 antagonistic strains (in the left column) on the 40 target strains (in the top line).

This finding suggests that the antagonistic bacteria carrying abundant BGCs (e.g., >10) tend to have a clear positive correlation between inhibition phenotype and phylogenetic distance, while those with fewer BGCs (e.g., <8) show a weak or even irregular antagonistic pattern against diverse targets. Furthermore, the BGC-phylogeny coherence was similar among all the antagonistic strains (no significant relevance with BGCs No.; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08, P\u2009=\u20090.4201, R2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.01994), while the antagonism-BGC distance correlation revealed a positive association with the quantity of BGCs in bacteria (i.e., bacteria having fewer BGCs showed a weak antagonism-BGC distance relevance, and vice versa.; Fig.\u00a04e, P\u2009=\u20090.0494, R2\u2009=\u20090.1824), which can partially explain the weak correlation between antagonism and phylogenetic distance in strains possessing fewer BGCs.Fig. 4Congeneric inhibition by fermentation supernatants is positively correlated with the phylogenetic and BGC distance in Bacillus.a Heatmap showing the antagonistic profiles of the fermentation supernatant of 17 antagonistic strains (in the left column) on the 40 target strains (in the top line).

This strategy can avoid potential bacterial nutrient competition and is feasible for a wider range of antagonistic strains since antagonism is not influenced by the growth speed or morphology of the colony (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). Here, we expanded the antagonistic strains to 17 species covering all four phylogenetic clades (Supplementary Data\u00a07). The extracellular metabolites of antagonistic bacteria also generally showed stronger inhibition to distantly related strains than to closely related strains; this pattern was particularly clear for antagonistic strains in the subtilis clade, which harbored the most BGCs (Fig.\u00a04a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06).

We used a typical secondary metabolite producer, B. velezensis SQR9 belonging to subtilis clade, to identify the primary antagonistic antibiotic towards different strains. Strain SQR9 devotes ~9.9% of its genome to the synthesis of various antimicrobial metabolites31, including five nonribosomal lipopeptides or dipeptides (surfactin, bacillomycin D, fengycin, bacillibactin, and bacilysin), three polyketides (macrolactin, bacillaene, and difficidin)32, and one antimicrobial fatty acid (FA; bacillunoic acid)18. The antagonistic characteristics of SQR9 mutants deficient in each of the above BGCs and SQR9\u0394sfp with the 4\u2019-phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene deleted and only bacilysin can be synthesized22,31 (Supplementary Data\u00a07), towards 24 target strains (Supplementary Data\u00a07) were investigated using a fermentation supernatant inhibition assay. Generally, the inhibition phenotype was almost completely attributed to these given BGCs (Fig.\u00a05, the \u201csum\u201d column). SQR9\u0394sfp nearly completely lost its antagonism towards all the target strains, suggesting that the synthesis of the antibiotics involved in congeneric antagonism is strongly dependent on Sfp (Fig.\u00a05). The active antimicrobial metabolites were found to be relevant to the phylogenetic positions of the target strains, as a specific BGC was involved in the inhibition of strains in one taxonomic group. In detail, difficidin dominated the suppression of the megaterium clade (Fig.\u00a05); macrolactin was the primary antibiotic against the cereus clade (Fig.\u00a05); difficidin and bacillaene both contributed to the inhibition of the circulans clade (Fig.\u00a05). Strain SQR9 also used the antimicrobial FA to compete with strains in closely related species (B. halotolerans CF7, B. licheniformis LY2, and B. sonorensis YX13) (Fig.\u00a05). Furthermore, we assigned the BGCs presence\u00a0in the testing strains based on their genomic information, or for\u00a0the non-sequenced strains\u00a0if more than 80% of the corresponding Bacillus species genomes possessed the cluster (marked by the cross in Fig.\u00a05). Importantly, antagonism was fully attributed to the BGCs that were present in strain SQR9 but absent in the target strains, while the metabolites shared by both SQR9 and the target strain were not involved. Additionally, the three identified functional antibiotics (difficidin, macrolactin, and bacillaene) for congeneric inhibition belongs to PKSother or PKS-NRPS\u00a0Hybrids classes; enrichment of both classes in subtilis clade than the other three (Supplementary Table\u00a01) coincides with the weak inhibition on subtilis clade by strain SQR9. Taken together, these results demonstrated that interference competition was dependent on the BGCs specifically harbored by the antagonistic strains, and strains that shared more (analogous) BGCs tended to have a lower probability and intensity of antagonism. It should be noted that not all the unique BGCs in antagonistic strains contributed to the inhibition of the target (Fig.\u00a05) and the outcome may also depend on whether a specific secondary metabolite is being synthesized or not, this aspect still needs further investigation.Fig. 5Contribution of BGCs to antagonizing Bacillus species from different clades by B. velezensis SQR9.The heatmap shows the contribution of each BGC product (on the top) to the inhibition of each target strain (on the left), which was calculated as the percentage of the decreased inhibition zone of the corresponding BGC-deficient mutant compared with wild-type.

Darwin in the Origin of Species, that is, congeneric species are likely to compete more fiercely by means of their functional similarity33, has been examined in various organisms and has received both positive and negative support34\u201337. With regard to the microbial fierce competition exemplified by antagonism, Russel et al. found a negative correlation between inhibition probability and phylogenetic distance9; some other scientists discovered a positive relationship between antagonistic interaction (including kin discrimination) and phylogenetic dissimilarity in genus Vibrio7 and Streptomyces10,11, and species B. subtilis12,13. The present study demonstrated that antagonism tended to be positively correlated with phylogenetic distance within the genus Bacillus (Figs.\u00a03 and 4). Comprehensively, we pronounce that within a relatively narrow phylogenetic range such as for congeneric strains, BGC similarity, which determines the secondary metabolite profile, appears to be the main driver of antagonistic interactions (Figs.\u00a02\u20135). BGCs themselves, or other elements in the same genome, usually encode antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to afford self-resistance by providing active efflux or modification of the relevant metabolite29,38, while the absence of a specific BGC suggests the potential to be sensitive to this compound17,18; this principle was also confirmed by the observation that antagonism was dependent on the BGC that was present in the antagonistic strain but absent in the target strain (Fig.\u00a05). In addition, despite the mobility of BGCs among different microbes16,39 as indicated by the prevalence of a number of homologous clusters in genomes from phylogenetically distant species (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09), their distribution pattern was generally in accordance with the phylogenetic relationship within genus (Fig.\u00a02b, c). Consequently, closely related species with a higher BGC similarity have a lower probability of inhibiting each other, while distant species in the same genus are likely to suppress each other more fiercely (Figs.\u00a03 and 4). Therefore, we highlighted that the coherence between BGCs distribution and phylogenetic characteristics is one of the crucial factors regulating congeneric interactions. Comparatively, at a larger taxonomic scale, the significant variation in the BGCs distribution among bacteria from different genera or even phyla can contribute to an irregular correlation between the secondary metabolite profile and phylogenetic distance28,40,41. In this situation, functional similarity, such as metabolic niche overlap, may become the main driver and lead to a negative correlation between antagonism and phylogenetic distance9.

This attribution can partially explain the weak correlation between antagonism and phylogeny in these strains. Furthermore, other potential factors may also contribute to the relatively low correlation between antagonism and phylogeny, for example, the unknown secondary metabolites of bacteriocins may specifically kill close relatives, internal genetic variation (e.g., point mutations, partial deletion, altered gene regulation, and silent expression) or external cues (e.g., environmental factors and competing strains) can affect the antibiotic production11,17,42,43, and the undiscovered genetic and physiological features may also regulate the response to different predicted BGCs.
