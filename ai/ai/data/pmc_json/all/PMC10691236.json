We apply the approach to reveal roseopurpurin C as a potent inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). This work represents an example of the use of resistance gene\u2013guided genome mining in fungi for the identification of an inhibitor of a target that has been clinically validated for the treatment of multiple cancers.", "With the significant increase in the availability of microbial genome sequences in recent years, resistance gene\u2013guided genome mining has emerged as a powerful approach for identifying natural products with specific bioactivities. Here, we present the use of this approach to reveal the roseopurpurins as potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), a class of cell cycle regulators implicated in multiple cancers. We identified a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) with a putative resistance gene with homology to human CDK2. Using targeted gene disruption and transcription factor overexpression in Aspergillus uvarum, and heterologous expression of the BGC in Aspergillus nidulans, we demonstrated that roseopurpurin C (1) is produced by this cluster and characterized its biosynthesis. We determined the potency, specificity, and mechanism of action of 1 as well as multiple intermediates and shunt products produced from the BGC. We show that 1 inhibits human CDK2 with a Kiapp of 44 nM, demonstrates selectivity for clinically relevant members of the CDK family, and induces G1 cell cycle arrest in HCT116 cells. Structural analysis of 1 complexed with CDK2 revealed the molecular basis of ATP-competitive inhibition.", "Bioactive natural products have provided significant therapeutic benefits for many diseases; however, it has historically been challenging to establish the mechanism of action of these natural products and identify the target protein(s) with which they interact. With the rise in available genome sequences, resistance gene\u2013guided genome mining has emerged as a powerful tool to identify natural products targeting a specific protein of interest. This approach relies on the insight that in some biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), the producing organism encodes within the BGC a resistance gene in the form of a copy of the molecular target of the BGC\u2019s product (1). This resistance gene is not required for the biosynthesis of any natural products but serves to protect the host from the toxicity of its own metabolites. In fungi, this phenomenon was first appreciated with the identification of a copy of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase within the lovastatin BGC of Aspergillus terreus (2, 3). Multiple other resistance gene\u2013encoding BGCs have since been identified in fungi (4), including BGCs that produce inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis (squalestatin (5), restricticin (6), and hymeglusin (7)), the proteasome (fellutamide B (8)), glycolysis (heptelidic acid (9)), oxidative phosphorylation (aurovertin and citreoviridin (10)), and calcineurin (cyclosporine A (11)). In each of these cases, the identification of a resistance gene validated the relationship between a known natural product and a molecular target that had been empirically determined previously, in some cases decades prior to the characterization of the BGC. More recently, resistance gene\u2013guided genome mining has been used more prospectively to identify aspterric acid (12) as an inhibitor of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, a promising point of intervention for herbicides for use in agriculture. Here, we extend this approach to the identification of 1 as an inhibitor of CDK2 demonstrating the use of resistance gene\u2013guided genome mining in fungi for the identification of an inhibitor of a clinically validated target in oncology.", "Fungal natural products have been shown to be potent and specific inhibitors of a variety of human kinases (13, 14). With this in mind, we sought to use resistance gene\u2013guided mining of fungal genomes to identify inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The CDKs are a family of kinases that are critical factors in both the control of the cell cycle and protein translation. In fungi, the CDK family comprises 6 proteins. In humans, this family has diverged to comprise 20 proteins (15). The misregulation of several CDK proteins in a variety of cancers makes them attractive drug targets (16).", "Several inhibitors of the CDK protein family have been identified using both traditional screening and computational methods (17, 18). These include synthetic compounds dinaciclib (2, CDK2/5/9) (19) and palbociclib (5, CDK4/6) (20) along with flavopiridol (3, CDK1/2/4/7) (21) and butyrolactone I (4, CDK2) (22), two compounds of natural origin (Fig. 1). Here, we expand the list of CDK inhibitors by using resistance gene\u2013guided genome mining to identify a family of BGCs present across multiple genomes that encode a resistance gene with homology to human CDK2. Through a combination of in situ cluster engineering in Aspergillus uvarum and heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans, we demonstrate that these BGCs produce roseopurpurin C (1), a depsidone natural product. We characterize the activity of 1, revealing it as a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of CDK2 (Kiapp of 44 nM) with selectivity for CDK family kinases which induces G1 phase cell cycle arrest. We profile several precursors and shunt products of 1 to define a preliminary structure\u2013activity relationship, and, in combination with the co-crystal structure of 1 bound to human CDK2, we define the structural basis for CDK2 engagement.", "Fig. 1.Characterized inhibitors of human CDKs.", "Characterized inhibitors of human CDKs.", "Results", "Results", "Identification and Characterization of the Roseopurpurin BGC.", "Identification and Characterization of the Roseopurpurin BGC.", "Identification and Characterization of the Roseopurpurin BGC.", "To find gene clusters capable of producing inhibitors of CDK2, we looked within our library of annotated BGCs for those that contained a gene encoding a protein that had \u226550% amino acid identity with human CDK2.

Similar results were obtained in cells treated with the known G1-arresting CDK inhibitors flavopiridol, dinaciclib, KO386, and palbociclib but not in cells treated with the G2-arresting microtubule inhibitor nocodazole (SI Appendix, Fig. S7 C and D).", "Taken together, these data demonstrate that 1 is cell permeable and inhibits CDK2 in a cellular environment, thereby arresting cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.", "Taken together, these data demonstrate that 1 is cell permeable and inhibits CDK2 in a cellular environment, thereby arresting cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.", "Taken together, these data demonstrate that 1 is cell permeable and inhibits CDK2 in a cellular environment, thereby arresting cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.", "1 Is CDK-Selective Type 1 Kinase Inhibitor.", "1 Is CDK-Selective Type 1 Kinase Inhibitor.", "1 Is CDK-Selective Type 1 Kinase Inhibitor.", "To obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanism of CDK2 inhibition by 1, we determined the co-crystal structure of 1 bound to CDK2 at a resolution of 2.62 \u00c5.

By profiling the activity of 1 against a panel of human kinases, we demonstrate that it is both potent and quite specific for the CDK1/2/3, CDK5, and CDK4/6 kinase subfamilies. That we see good selectivity for these CDK subfamilies, but only modest selectivity within them is likely caused by the significant divergence in the evolution of the CDKs between fungi and humans and the ATP-competitive mechanism of inhibition. Most fungal species have only 6 CDK paralogs, while the human genome has 20. Indeed, the entire CDK1/2/3/4/6 and CDK5 subfamilies can each be traced back to a single homolog in fungi, represented by CDC28 and Pho85 in S. cerevisiae, respectively (15). Outside of the CDK branch of the CMGC kinase family, nanomolar inhibition of two CAMK family Ser/Thr kinases, AMPK\u03b11 and CAMK4 was observed (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S9 and S10). This potent inhibition can likely be explained based on alignments of the 1-CDK2 structure with published AMPK\u03b11 (PDB 4CFF) and CAMK4 structures (PDB 2W4O), which reveal that the key 1-CDK2 binding interactions are maintained with both proteins despite significant sequence divergence in the ATP-binding pockets (SI Appendix, Figs. S12\u2013S14).", "While this work was in progress, a report emerged of human CDK2 inhibition by 1 and 12 isolated from cultures of A. fumigatus, a species whose genome contains the rosepurpurin gene cluster (42), corroborating our observations that these metabolites are inhibitors of human CDK2. By profiling the activity of 1 against a panel of human kinases, we demonstrate that it is both potent and quite specific for the CDK1/2/3, CDK5, and CDK4/6 kinase subfamilies. That we see good selectivity for these CDK subfamilies, but only modest selectivity within them is likely caused by the significant divergence in the evolution of the CDKs between fungi and humans and the ATP-competitive mechanism of inhibition.

Three key hydrogen-bonding interactions were identified in the structure. First, the 3\u2032-OH group of 1 interacts with the amide backbone of Glu81 and Leu83 in the hinge region of CDK2. Similar hinge-region interactions are observed for structurally diverse natural products with ATP-competitive kinase inhibitory activity (43) and synthetic kinase inhibitors, including dinaciclib (39). Second, the 4-OH group of 1 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp86. Epimerization of the 4-OH in 1 to afford 12 results in a 50-fold reduction in potency (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, comparison of the potency of 8 (which lacks the 4-OH) and 7, reveals that the addition of this critical hydrogen-bond donor improves potency by approximately ninefold (Fig. 3B). Third, the 9\u2032-carbonyl of 1, forms a hydrogen bond with Asp145. The coordination of this central ring potentially helps orient the metabolite in the binding site.
