The cell wall of A. fumigatus has been studied intensively as a potential target for development of effective antifungal agents. A major role in maintaining cell wall integrity is played by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) MpkA. To gain a comprehensive insight into this central signal transduction pathway, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the \u0394mpkA mutant under standard and cell wall stress conditions. Besides genes involved in cell wall remodelling, protection against ROS and secondary metabolism such as gliotoxin, pyomelanin and pseurotin A, also genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis were regulated by MpkA. Consistently, northern and western blot analyses indicated that iron starvation triggers phosphorylation and thus activation of MpkA. Furthermore, localization studies indicated that MpkA accumulates in the nucleus under iron depletion. Hence, we report the first connection between a MAPK pathway and siderophore biosynthesis. The measurement of amino acid pools and of the pools of polyamines indicated that arginine was continuously converted into ornithine to fuel the siderophore pool in the \u0394mpkA mutant strain. Based on our data, we propose that MpkA fine-tunes the balance between stress response and energy consuming cellular processes.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Responding to external signals and adaptation to changes in the environment is indispensable for the viability of all organisms. Aspergillus fumigatus, a saprophytic fungus, is able to grow and proliferate in a variety of environments (Tekaia and Latg\u00e9, 2005). It can colonize the human body where it is challenged by diverse physical and chemical conditions, such as presence of cell wall-degrading enzymes, oxidizing agents, limited nutrient availability, or changing pH, osmolarity and temperature. Yet, it has emerged to be the most common fungal pathogen causing invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients (Brakhage, 2005; Dagenais and Keller, 2009; Brakhage et al., 2010).", "Responding to external signals and adaptation to changes in the environment is indispensable for the viability of all organisms.

The genome of A. fumigatus harbours four MAPK genes: sakA/hogA, mpkA, mpkB and mpkC (May et al., 2005). MpkA is a key player of the cell wall integrity pathway of A. fumigatus. In addition, it is involved in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and affects the formation of pyomelanin derived from tyrosine degradation (Valiante et al., 2008; 2009). The MAP kinase SakA has been shown to be involved in conidial germination under nitrogen and carbon source starvation and to respond to hypertonic conditions, ROS and heat shock (Xue et al., 2004). MpkC shows similarity to SakA. This kinase is involved in sensing alternative carbon sources (Reyes et al., 2006).

In this activation loop, the cell wall plays an important role both as sensor and as protector of the living cell. It is subjected to continuous changes in its polymer composition in response to different environmental stimuli. Furthermore, the composition of the fungal cell wall is unique to eukaryotic organisms and therefore is considered an attractive target in antifungal drug research (Gastebois et al., 2009).

While these compounds are effective against A. fumigatus in vitro, information is still lacking concerning the pharmacodynamic for echinocandin monotherapy in patients with IA (Lewis, 2009). It is conceivable that salvage pathways exist in A. fumigatus that could reduce the efficacy of fungal drugs targeted against the cell wall. On the other hand, recent studies on a mutant lacking mkk2 (MAPKK) of the cell wall integrity pathway in A. fumigatus showed an enhanced sensitivity to azoles, namely posaconazole and voriconazole (Dirr et al., 2010).

These findings imply that expression of hapX and sreA is mpkA-independent.", "Because MpkA appears to reduce siderophore biosynthesis in A. fumigatus, we investigated whether this MpkA-dependent inhibition of siderophore requires HapX or SreA. Therefore, we generated mutants lacking hapX or sreA in a \u0394mpkA background (Fig. S6). Northern blot analysis revealed that the \u0394mpkA mutant and the wild type maintained equal levels of sreA transcript under iron availability. It is interesting to note that expression of sreA also remained unaltered in the \u0394hapX/\u0394mpkA mutant compared with the \u0394hapX single mutant under iron limitation (Fig. 4A). This finding indicates that MpkA plays no role in regulating sreA levels under any of the aforementioned conditions and that the expression of sreA during iron deprivation is due to impairment of transcriptional regulation by HapX on sreA. Likewise, mRNA levels of hapX were unaffected in wild type, \u0394mpkA, \u0394sreA and \u0394sreA/\u0394mpkA under iron limitation and also in \u0394sreA and \u0394sreA/\u0394mpkA under iron-replete conditions (Fig. 4B).

With the result of dry weight measurement as a key indicator of modified yet comparatively robust metabolism in \u0394mpkA strain, we hypothesized a reshuffle of the amino acid pool occurred, particularly of ornithine, under iron-limitation and iron-replete conditions in these mutants. The wild type and \u0394mpkA mutant strain were grown in iron-depleted and iron-replete media. The samples were subsequently subjected to HPLC analysis for determining the concentration of free amino acids (Table 1). The total quantity of free amino acids extracted from \u0394mpkA was always lower than the quantity extracted from the wild type. Ornithine is synthesized either from glutamate or from ornithine-derived arginine (Fig. 5B).

Glutamine, which is a precursor for arginine, showed a 14.2-fold increase in \u0394mpkA under \u2212Fe conditions, while in the wild type the fold change was 5.6. Glutamate levels remained constant in the wild type and in the \u0394mpkA strain under +Fe and \u2212Fe. In strain \u0394mpkA, the ornithine level increased ninefold under Fe deplete conditions, whereas in the wild type only an increase of 2.6-fold occurred. In general, in the \u0394mpkA mutant a high level of free ornithine during iron-depletion condition was present. Ornithine is also converted into polyamines which are important for the growth and development of all cells. Polyamines consist of the diamine putrescine, the triamine spermidine and the tetraamine spermine. Polyamine measurements showed that putrescine and spermidine levels decreased in the wild type during iron depletion, while they remained constant in the \u0394mpkA mutant (Table 1). On the contrary, the level of spermine remained quite constant in the wild type while it increased in the mutant. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis showed upregulation of an arginase gene in \u0394mpkA in comparison with the wild type under \u2212Fe conditions (Fig. 5C). Arginase catalyses the conversion of arginine into ornithine which can be further used as a precursor for siderophores, polyamines and cytoplasmic glutamate (Schrettl et al., 2010a).

This result in conjunction with the increase in glutamine levels in the \u0394mpkA strain under iron starvation implied that arginine was continuously converted into ornithine to fuel siderophore biosynthesis. Since ornithine aminotransferase, responsible for recycling ornithine back to the glutamate cycle, showed no change in expression and the glutamate level decreased in the mutant under iron starvation, these data indicated that ornithine was not converted back to glutamate. Moreover, both the ornithine transporter (AmcA) required for transport of ornithine from mitochondria to the cytoplasm and spermidine synthase showed no change in expression in the \u0394mpkA mutant as well.

These data indicate that MpkA is required for adaptation to iron starvation by reshuffling of the pool of amino acids.", "Recent data have shed light on iron starvation-driven remodelling of the free amino acid pool in A. fumigatus wherein highlighting the importance of upregulation of the cellular ornithine pool as a precursor to stimulate siderophore biosynthesis (Schrettl et al., 2010a,b;) (Fig. 5B). Moreover, hapX was shown to be essential for this metabolic co-ordination. With the result of dry weight measurement as a key indicator of modified yet comparatively robust metabolism in \u0394mpkA strain, we hypothesized a reshuffle of the amino acid pool occurred, particularly of ornithine, under iron-limitation and iron-replete conditions in these mutants. The wild type and \u0394mpkA mutant strain were grown in iron-depleted and iron-replete media. The samples were subsequently subjected to HPLC analysis for determining the concentration of free amino acids (Table 1). The total quantity of free amino acids extracted from \u0394mpkA was always lower than the quantity extracted from the wild type. Ornithine is synthesized either from glutamate or from ornithine-derived arginine (Fig. 5B). The arginine level showed a 3.2-fold increase in the wild type grown under \u2212Fe conditions compared with +Fe conditions and an increase of 4.5-fold was observed in strain \u0394mpkA cultivated under \u2212Fe conditions versus \u0394mpkA cultivated under +Fe conditions (Table 1). Glutamine, which is a precursor for arginine, showed a 14.2-fold increase in \u0394mpkA under \u2212Fe conditions, while in the wild type the fold change was 5.6. Glutamate levels remained constant in the wild type and in the \u0394mpkA strain under +Fe and \u2212Fe. In strain \u0394mpkA, the ornithine level increased ninefold under Fe deplete conditions, whereas in the wild type only an increase of 2.6-fold occurred. In general, in the \u0394mpkA mutant a high level of free ornithine during iron-depletion condition was present. Ornithine is also converted into polyamines which are important for the growth and development of all cells. Polyamines consist of the diamine putrescine, the triamine spermidine and the tetraamine spermine. Polyamine measurements showed that putrescine and spermidine levels decreased in the wild type during iron depletion, while they remained constant in the \u0394mpkA mutant (Table 1). On the contrary, the level of spermine remained quite constant in the wild type while it increased in the mutant. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis showed upregulation of an arginase gene in \u0394mpkA in comparison with the wild type under \u2212Fe conditions (Fig. 5C). Arginase catalyses the conversion of arginine into ornithine which can be further used as a precursor for siderophores, polyamines and cytoplasmic glutamate (Schrettl et al., 2010a). Strikingly, ornithine decarboxylase, which catalyses conversion of ornithine to polyamines via putrescine, was downregulated in \u0394mpkA under iron deficiency. This result in conjunction with the increase in glutamine levels in the \u0394mpkA strain under iron starvation implied that arginine was continuously converted into ornithine to fuel siderophore biosynthesis. Since ornithine aminotransferase, responsible for recycling ornithine back to the glutamate cycle, showed no change in expression and the glutamate level decreased in the mutant under iron starvation, these data indicated that ornithine was not converted back to glutamate. Moreover, both the ornithine transporter (AmcA) required for transport of ornithine from mitochondria to the cytoplasm and spermidine synthase showed no change in expression in the \u0394mpkA mutant as well. It appears that the \u0394mpkA mutant responds to iron starvation by using increased level of free ornithine for siderophore biosynthesis without exhibiting any negative effect on cellular processes.

Furthermore, reduced expression of MnSOD in absence of mpkA suggested that this gene is partially regulated by MpkA under standard growth conditions while activation of MpkA resulted in increased expression of MnSOD.

Several levels of genetic regulation govern when and where secondary metabolites will be produced (Hoffmeister and Keller, 2007; Brakhage and Schroeckh, 2011). Global transcription factors involved in nitrogen (AreA), carbon (CreA), pH (PacC) homeostasis, developmentally regulated transcription factors such as StuA or the CCAAT binding factor AnCF often affect the expression of secondary metabolite gene clusters (Keller et al., 2005; Brakhage et al., 2009; Twumasi-Boateng et al., 2009; Brakhage and Schroeckh, 2011). Moreover, LaeA, a putative methyltransferase, is known to regulate secondary metabolism gene clusters in Aspergilli (Bok and Keller, 2004). Most of the work devoted to dissecting signal transduction mechanisms involved in regulating secondary metabolism in Aspergilli points towards involvement of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling pathways (Hicks et al., 1997; Brodhagen and Keller, 2006; Gehrke et al., 2010). Downstream effectors of GPCRs are, e.g. adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA pathways and MAP kinase pathways. The cAMP/PKA pathway has been shown to be involved in mycotoxin and melanin production in Aspergilli (Brodhagen and Keller, 2006; Grosse et al., 2008). There have not been many reports linking MAP kinases to the production of natural products in fungi. In A. nidulans, MAP kinase MpkB, a component of the putative FUS3 signalling pathway, regulated transcription of genes involved in secondary metabolism by partially influencing regulation of laeA transcription (Atoui et al., 2008). Previously, we showed that cell wall stress resulting in hyperphosphorylation of MpkA, increased production of the dark brownish pigment pyomelanin. The precise role of pyomelanin is unknown, but it has been proposed that it acts as a part of salvage pathway against cell wall perturbation in A. fumigatus (Schmaler-Ripcke et al., 2009; Valiante et al., 2009). The microarray data shown here corroborated this finding as under cell wall stress, many genes of the pyomelanin cluster were upregulated. Furthermore, HPLC analysis showed that mpkA deletion in A. fumigatus led to a decrease in production of gliotoxin, a potent immunosuppressant belonging to the epipolythiodioxopiperazine class of fungal toxins (Kupfahl et al., 2008; Scharf et al., 2010). Microarray analysis revealed that the mRNA level of gliT, a gene of the gliotoxin biosynthesis cluster, was significantly reduced in \u0394mpkA. Previous results showed that deletion of gliT renders A. fumigatus highly sensitive to gliotoxin. Moreover, gliotoxin was reported to be involved in protecting A. fumigatus against oxidative stress which is in concordance to our results elucidating a role of MpkA in defence against ROS (Scharf et al., 2010; Schrettl et al., 2010b).", "A remarkable result of the transcriptome analysis of \u0394mpkA was the finding of differential regulation of genes involved in biosynthesis of several secondary metabolite gene clusters.

In A. nidulans, MAP kinase MpkB, a component of the putative FUS3 signalling pathway, regulated transcription of genes involved in secondary metabolism by partially influencing regulation of laeA transcription (Atoui et al., 2008). Previously, we showed that cell wall stress resulting in hyperphosphorylation of MpkA, increased production of the dark brownish pigment pyomelanin. The precise role of pyomelanin is unknown, but it has been proposed that it acts as a part of salvage pathway against cell wall perturbation in A. fumigatus (Schmaler-Ripcke et al., 2009; Valiante et al., 2009). The microarray data shown here corroborated this finding as under cell wall stress, many genes of the pyomelanin cluster were upregulated. Furthermore, HPLC analysis showed that mpkA deletion in A. fumigatus led to a decrease in production of gliotoxin, a potent immunosuppressant belonging to the epipolythiodioxopiperazine class of fungal toxins (Kupfahl et al., 2008; Scharf et al., 2010). Microarray analysis revealed that the mRNA level of gliT, a gene of the gliotoxin biosynthesis cluster, was significantly reduced in \u0394mpkA. Previous results showed that deletion of gliT renders A. fumigatus highly sensitive to gliotoxin. Moreover, gliotoxin was reported to be involved in protecting A. fumigatus against oxidative stress which is in concordance to our results elucidating a role of MpkA in defence against ROS (Scharf et al., 2010; Schrettl et al., 2010b).", "Furthermore, unexpectedly, we established a link between MpkA and production of siderophores. Siderophores are a class of small molecules that are secreted by microbes to chelate iron, and thus mediate uptake of this essential trace element. A. fumigatus produces two major siderophores to capture extracellular iron, namely intracellular fusarinine C (FC) and its acetylated derivative, i.e. the extracellular triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC) (Schrettl et al., 2007). These compounds are assembled by NRPS systems whose expression is strictly regulated by the availability of iron. A lack of both intra- and extracellular siderophores due to deficiency in the ornithine monooxygenase SidA (\u0394sidA strain) or the iron regulator HapX (\u0394hapX strain) was shown to render A. fumigatus avirulent in a neutropenic mouse model of invasive aspergillosis (Schrettl et al., 2004; 2010a). Here, we showed that under iron deficiency MpkA is activated by phosphorylation and localized to the nucleus. Deletion of mpkA increased extracellular siderophores by enhancing sidA expression in A. fumigatus. Moreover, the MpkA regulation of siderophores was independent of HapX/SreA-regulated mechanisms that were shown to be the major regulators for maintaining iron homeostasis. This is a paradox to the role siderophores play, as they ensure an adequate supply of iron for the fungus, and are of importance for fungal growth in particular during iron starvation.", "Furthermore, unexpectedly, we established a link between MpkA and production of siderophores.

Ornithine is also a precursor for polyamines in the fungal cell. The three most commonly occurring natural polyamines are putrescine, spermidine and spermine. In fungi, these compounds have been reported to be important for cell differentiation processes including sporulation, spore germination and dimorphic transition (Guevara-Olvera et al., 1993; Lopez et al., 1997). In A. nidulans, spermidine is essential for viability and it was suggested that certain threshold levels of spermidine are required for specific developmental processes (Jin et al., 2002). By analysing the amino acid pool composition of \u0394mpkA and the wild type under iron starvation conditions, it was observed that most amino acids showing a change in the wild type also showed a change in the mutant. Although the individual amounts of amino acids were lower in the mutant than the wild type, ornithine showed a comparable level to that of the wild type under iron starvation. Increasing mRNA steady-state levels of arginase and ornithine decarboxylase in the wild type indicate that increased amounts of ornithine were preferentially used for siderophore biosynthesis than for polyamine production. In addition, the polyamine level in the wild-type strain decreased during iron starvation while it remained constant in the \u0394mpkA mutant. The importance of polyamines in physiology is illustrated by the changes in polyamine concentration on exposure to stress conditions (Minguet et al., 2008). This implies that under iron deprivation MpkA competes to divert available ornithine in production of polyamines for essential survival processes. Remarkably, in contrast to the wild type the \u0394mpkA mutant strain showed no difference in biomass production under iron-deficient and iron-sufficient conditions. In contrast, the wild type grown in iron-deficient medium showed a significantly reduced dry weight compared with growth in iron-sufficient medium. This finding suggests that \u0394mpkA did not react in response to the lack of iron.", "The major substrate required for the formation of siderophores is ornithine (Schrettl et al., 2010a).

It will be very interesting to identify MpkA-regulated transcription factors which affect the above-mentioned phenomena (Fig. 6).
