["", "Over\nthe past 30 years, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of\ninfections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which have proliferated\ndue to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Over this same time\nperiod, however, there has also been a decline in the number of antibiotics\nwith novel mechanisms of action coming to market. Therefore, there\nis a growing need for an increase in the speed at which new antibiotics\nare discovered and developed. Natural products produced by bacteria\nhave been and continue to be a robust source of novel antibiotics;\nhowever, new and complementary methods for screening large bacterial\nlibraries for novel antibiotic production are needed due to the current\nagar methods being limited in scope, time consuming, and prone to\nerror. Herein, we describe a rapid, robust, and quantitative high-throughput\nliquid culture screening method for antibiotic production by bacteria.\nThis method has the ability to screen both mono- and coculture mixtures\nof bacteria in vitro and be adapted to other phenotypic\nnatural product analyses. Over 260 bacterial species were screened\nin monoculture, and 38 and 34% were found to produce antibiotics capable\nof inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli, respectively,\nwith 8 and 4% being classified as strong producers (\u226530% growth\ninhibition), respectively. Bacteria found to not produce antibiotics\nin monoculture were also screened in coculture using an adaptation\nof this method. Of the more than 270 cocultures screened, 14 and 30%\nwere found to produce antibiotics capable of inhibition of S. aureus or E. coli, respectively. Of those bacteria found to produce antibiotics in\nmonoculture, 43 bacteria were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and\nfound to be majority Pseudomonas (37%), Serratia (19%), and Bacillus (14%) bacteria, but two novel\nproducers, Herbaspirillum and Kluyvera, were also found.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Multidrug-resistant\nbacterial infections are one of the top three threats to global public\nhealth and are projected to cause up to 10 million deaths worldwide\nby the year 2050 if the current trend continues.1,2 There\nare many factors that contribute to the upsurge of multidrug-resistant\nbacterial infections with the largest being the overuse and misuse\nof antibiotics both in medicine, as they are among the most commonly\nprescribed drugs, and in agriculture.3,4 Resistance\nto a particular antibiotic can occur rapidly and broadly, where bacteria\ncan become resistant to an entire class of drugs with the same mechanism\nof action.

Purified PCR product send-off was prepared in a total\nvolume of 15 \u03bcL for sequencing at 4 ng/\u03bcL products, 25\npmol 27F primer, and nuclease-free water. Samples were sent to GeneWiz\n(Cambridge, MA) for Sanger sequencing. Sanger sequencing results were\ncross-checked with the National Center for Biotechnology Information\nand Ribosomal Database Project for genus-level identification.", "Genus-level identification was determined using 16S rRNA amplification\nand DNA sequence analysis. Universal 16S rRNA primers were 27F (AGA\nGTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG) and 1492R (CGG TTA CCT TGT TAC GAC TT). Polymerase\nchain reactions (PCRs) were completed for 50 \u03bcL reactions containing\na 5\u00d7 Phusion green HF buffer (10 \u03bcL), 10 mM dNTP (1 \u03bcL),\nPhusion DNA polymerase (0.5 \u03bcL), 10 mM universal primers (2.5\n\u03bcL), 100 ng/mL template, and nuclease-free water. Thermocycler\nwas set for initial denaturing at 98 \u00b0C (3 min), followed by\n29 cycles of 98 \u00b0C (30 s), 48 \u00b0C (30 s), and 72 \u00b0C\n(5 min). After 29 cycles were completed, the sample underwent a final\nextension at 72 \u00b0C (5 min). PCR products were visualized for\nsize separation on 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 \u03bcg/mL ethidium\nbromide in 1\u00d7 TAE.
