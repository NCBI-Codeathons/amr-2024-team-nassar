Self-resistance against gliotoxin is effected by the gliotoxin oxidase GliT, and attenuation of gliotoxin biosynthesis is catalysed by gliotoxin S-methyltransferase GtmA. Here we describe the X-ray crystal structures of GtmA-apo (1.66 \u00c5), GtmA complexed to S-adenosylhomocysteine (1.33 \u00c5) and GtmA complexed to S-adenosylmethionine (2.28 \u00c5), providing mechanistic insights into this important biotransformation. We further reveal that simultaneous elimination of the ability of A. fumigatus to dissipate highly reactive dithiol gliotoxin, via deletion of GliT and GtmA, results in the most significant hypersensitivity to exogenous gliotoxin observed to date. Indeed, quantitative proteomic analysis of \u0394gliT::\u0394gtmA reveals an uncontrolled over-activation of the gli-cluster upon gliotoxin exposure. The data presented herein reveal, for the first time, the extreme risk associated with intracellular dithiol gliotoxin biosynthesis\u2014in the absence of an efficient dismutation capacity. Significantly, a previously concealed protective role for GtmA and functionality of ETP bis-thiomethylation as an ancestral protection strategy against dithiol compounds is now evident.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Ascomycetes constitute the largest phylum of the fungal kingdom and produce a copious array of natural products.

Gliotoxin, produced by the opportunistic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, is the prototypic member of this large family [3]. As with other ETPs, gliotoxin is produced through a sequential series of enzymatic steps which are organized into a coordinated biosynthetic gene cluster (figure\u00a01). Although the mechanism of action for the cytotoxicity of gliotoxin has not been fully elucidated, two primary activities have been described: the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidation of the disulfide bridge and mixed disulfide formation. The stereochemically complex core of ETPs, coupled with their potent biological activities, make these compounds an attractive target for drug leads [7].\nFigure 1.Conversion of gliotoxin between the reduced (dithiol gliotoxin), oxidized (gliotoxin) and bisthiomethyl forms.

Recently, it was shown that disruption of the uncharacterized methyltransferase MT-II in A. niger resulted in increased sensitivity to exogenous gliotoxin. Like GtmA, recombinantly expressed MT-II was shown to sequentially bis-thiomethylate dithiol gliotoxin, forming monomethylgliotoxin (MmGT) and then BmGT [15]. MT-II is an orthologue of GtmA (53% sequence identity), despite the fact that this organism does not produce gliotoxin. This suggested that bis-thiomethylation may have an ancestral role in protecting organisms against dithiol-containing toxins in selected filamentous fungi, such as A. niger and A. nidulans [13,15]. However, it appears that ETP self-protection in producer organisms is dominated by reversible enzyme-catalysed epidisulfide formation, whereas the permanent, metabolically expensive mechanism of ETP S-methylation has become specialized to regulate ETP production in filamentous fungi [12].", "Are non-ETP producers capable of protecting themselves against these potent natural products?

This suggests that after the first S-methylation, MmGT leaves the GtmA complex and is then taken up for methylation on the opposite thiol by a second GtmA molecule with SAM bound. Based on these data, it appears that GtmA has higher affinity for dithiol gliotoxin than for MmGT, resulting in the preferential modification of dithiol gliotoxin to MmGT before the S-methylation of MmGT in the second position. The fact that GtmA does not appear to hold its substrate bound for a second methylation suggests that GtmA is not a processive enzyme, unlike previously characterized natural product methyltransferases which mediate consecutive methyltransfers [21].", "GtmA is not subject to SAH-mediated feedback inhibition", "GtmA is not subject to SAH-mediated feedback inhibition", "GtmA is not subject to SAH-mediated feedback inhibition", "The majority of SAM-dependent methyltransferases are known to be inhibited by SAH, the methyl-depleted version of SAM [22].

Comparative proteome abundance and data analysis was performed using MaxQuant software (v. 1.3.0.5) [52], with Andromeda used for database searching and Perseus used to organize the data (v. 1.4.1.3) [12].", "Analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus \u0394gtmA::gtmA-eGFP::H2A::mRFP\n26933 by confocal microscopy", "Analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus \u0394gtmA::gtmA-eGFP::H2A::mRFP\n26933 by confocal microscopy", "Analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus \u0394gtmA::gtmA-eGFP::H2A::mRFP\n26933 by confocal microscopy", "The gtmA-eGFP strain transformed with H2A::mRFP (1 \u00d7 104 conidia) was inoculated into 400 \u00b5l Czapek Dox medium in a Lab-Tek chambered borosilicate coverglass system. The chamber was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 21 h and then gliotoxin (5 \u00b5g ml\u22121 final) was added to the chambers. An equivalent volume of methanol was added to the control wells.
