["The glycopeptide A40926, produced by the actinomycete Nonomuraea gerenzanensis, is the precursor of dalbavancin, a second-generation glycopeptide antibiotic approved for clinical use in the USA and Europe in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The final product of the biosynthetic pathway is an O-acetylated form of A40926 (acA40926). Glycopeptide biosynthesis in N. gerenzanensis is dependent upon the dbv gene cluster that encodes, in addition to the two essential positive regulators Dbv3 and Dbv4, the putative members of a two-component signal transduction system, specifically the response regulator Dbv6 and the sensor kinase Dbv22. The aim of this work was to assign a role to these two genes. Our results demonstrate that deletion of dbv22 leads to an increased antibiotic production with a concomitant reduction in glycopeptide resistance. Deletion of dbv6 results in a similar phenotype, although the effects are not as strong as in the \u0394dbv22 mutant. Consistently, quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that Dbv6 and Dbv22 negatively regulate the regulatory genes (dbv3 and dbv4), as well as some dbv biosynthetic genes (dbv23 and dbv24), whereas Dbv6 and Dbv22 positively regulate transcription of the single, cluster-associated resistance gene. Finally, we demonstrate that exogenously added acA40926 and its precursor A40926 can modulate transcription of dbv genes but with an opposite extent: A40926 strongly stimulates transcription of the Dbv6/Dbv22 target genes while acA40926 has a neutral or negative effect on transcription of those genes. We propose a model in which glycopeptide biosynthesis in N. gerenzanensis is modulated through a positive feedback by the biosynthetic precursor A40926 and a negative feedback by the final product acA40926. In addition to previously reported control systems, this sophisticated control loop might help the producing strain cope with the toxicity of its own product. This work, besides leading to improved glycopeptide producing strains, enlarges our knowledge on the regulation of glycopeptide biosynthesis in actinomycetes, setting N. gerenzanensis and its two-component system Dbv6-Dbv22 apart from other glycopeptide producers.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The glycopeptide antibiotic A40926 (Fig.\u00a01A) is the precursor for dalbavancin (Fig.\u00a01B), a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide clinically used for treatment of acute skin infections caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.Figure 1Chemical structures of O-acetyl A40926 (A) and of dalbavancin (B) and genetic organization of the dbv cluster (C).

The core structure of A40926 consists of a heptapeptide containing the proteinogenic amino acid tyrosine and the non-proteinogenic amino acids 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DPG) and 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (HPG). The heptapeptide is assembled by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and modified by the action of various enzymes: four oxygenases, one halogenase, one hydroxylase, two glycosyltransferases, one hexose oxidase, one methyltransferase, one N-deacetylase, one N-acyltransferase and one O-acetyltransferase1. The form with the acetylated mannose (acA40926) is considered the final biosynthetic product2. However, mild extraction conditions are necessary to isolate acA40926. While A40926 and acA40926 are equipotent in antibacterial activity against most strains, the former is slightly more active against S. aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae3. Hence, the desacetylated form has been used as the substrate for dalbavancin semi-synthesis. In addition, as many methods for complex analysis involve alkaline treatment of the culture, which results in hydrolysis of the ester bond, past literature considered A40926 as the main fermentation product. Detailed studies of the regulation of glycopeptide biosynthesis in N. gerenzanensis will be crucial for the development of rational approaches towards overproduction of the dalbavancin precursor.

Here, we demonstrate that in N. gerenzanensis direct target genes of Dbv6 are the regulatory genes dbv3 and dbv4, and the genes dbv23-dbv22, coding for the acetyltransferase and the sensor kinase, and the dbv24-dbv28 operon, since the transcription of all these genes is induced in the \u0394dbv6 mutant background and that Dbv6 binds to the upstream regions of these genes. Another direct target of Dbv6 but regulated in the opposite manner is the peptidase dbv7 (Fig.\u00a07).", "The impacts of the dbv6 and dbv22 mutations are quantitatively different. First of all, the relative expression levels of the analyzed dbv genes (encoding the positive regulators Dbv3 and Dbv4, the prephenate dehydrogenase Dbv5, the acetyltransferase Dbv23 and the ABC-transported Dbv24) in the \u0394dbv6 mutant are somehow intermediate between those of the parental strain and of the \u0394dbv22 mutant (Fig.\u00a04). In terms of antibiotic resistance, the \u0394dbv22 strain is marginally but consistently more sensitive than the parental strain and the \u0394dbv6 mutant to A40926 and acA40926. Finally, when N. gerenzanensis is grown in production medium, the \u0394dbv6 and the \u0394dbv22 mutants show, up to 48\u2009h, an identical but slightly higher acA40926 production rate than the parental strain, with \u0394dbv22 keeping an equivalent rate up to 7 days and reaching acA40926 levels (350\u2009\u00b5g/mL) significantly higher than \u0394dbv6 and the parental strain (200 and 130\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively; Fig.\u00a03).

Indeed, the N. gerenzanensis genome harbors 43 and 47 TCS pairs, some of them highly related to VanR and VanS (Fig.\u00a08). A homologous of dbv6 gene is present in the N. gerenzanensis genome.

Thus, dbv6 does not apparently contribute to glycopeptide resistance while dbv22 does, suggesting that a second resistance mechanism influenced by Dbv22 takes over.
