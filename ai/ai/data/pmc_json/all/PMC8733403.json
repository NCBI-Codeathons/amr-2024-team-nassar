If they are used in excess, they contaminate the soil and water bodies and negatively affect human health and the environment. However, bioremediation is the most viable option to deal with these pollutants, but it has certain limitations. Therefore, harnessing the role of microbial biosurfactants in pesticide remediation is a promising approach. Biosurfactants are the amphiphilic compounds that can help to increase the bioavailability of pesticides, and speeds up the bioremediation process. Biosurfactants lower the surface area and interfacial tension of immiscible fluids and boost the solubility and sorption of hydrophobic pesticide contaminants. They have the property of biodegradability, low toxicity, high selectivity, and broad action spectrum under extreme pH, temperature, and salinity conditions, as well as a low critical micelle concentration (CMC). All these factors can augment the process of pesticide remediation. Application of metagenomic and in-silico tools would help by rapidly characterizing pesticide degrading microorganisms at a taxonomic and functional level. A comprehensive review of the literature shows that the role of biosurfactants in the biological remediation of pesticides has received limited attention. Therefore, this article is intended to provide a detailed overview of the role of various biosurfactants in improving pesticide remediation as well as different methods used for the detection of microbial biosurfactants. Additionally, this article covers the role of advanced metagenomics tools in characterizing the biosurfactant producing pesticide degrading microbes from different environments.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Soil pollution and land degradation are global problems originating from anthropological and natural sources (Malla et al., 2018). Urbanization and industrialization are the major sources of anthropological pollution while the use of chemical agents over the year for increasing crop production has led to the spread and accumulation of pollutants in the environment (Prihandiani et al., 2021). The most common contaminants in the soil are heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), or pesticides. Pesticides are the chemical compounds used to kill unwanted pests such as bugs, flies, rodents, nematodes, fungal pathogens, and unwanted herbs to maintain plant health and increase agricultural production on limited land. Pesticides play an essential part in fulfilling the world food demand, though they are very hazardous, persistent, recalcitrant, and have extended half-life properties (Wattanaphon et al., 2008; Damalas and Eleftherohorinos, 2011; Odukkathil and Vasudevan, 2016; Lamilla et al., 2021). The most common pesticides used in India and the other countries are organophosphates like chlorpyrifos, profenofos, and glyphosate, with a few being organochlorine i.e., mirex, lindane, and chlordane (Lamilla et al., 2021). These organophosphorus and organochlorine pesticides are not target-specific and have high biological stability in the soil and water bodies, polluting the ecosystem and making it pestilent for humans and other organisms such as pollinators, cattle, microbes, and aquatic organisms (Gennari et al., 2009; Sequinatto et al., 2013). Most organophosphate pesticides are classified as class II carcinogens with mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic effects on humans and other organisms (Bhatt et al., 2021a).", "Soil pollution and land degradation are global problems originating from anthropological and natural sources (Malla et al., 2018).

Most physical and chemical pesticide removal methods have been in use for a long time. These methods include aeration, oxidation, excavation, incineration, landfilling, and storage, etc., which is labor-intensive, time-consuming, inefficient, and are not considered a sustainable method of remediation because they result in the generation of several secondary pollutants (Yoshikawa et al., 2017; Bhatt et al., 2021a). As a result, the implementation of bioremediation appears as the only answer to the issue mentioned above since it uses the ability of live indigenous microorganisms to clean the polluted site (Singh et al., 2011). Researchers worldwide are now trying to create the most cost-effective and long-term sustainable method for pesticide bioremediation. Microbial biosurfactant-based remediation is a natural, cost-effective, and environmental friendly method of on-site degradation of pesticides and other xenobiotics in which biosurfactants make pesticides bioavailable and microbes use them as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous (Abouseoud et al., 2008; Luna et al., 2013; Chapr\u00e3o et al., 2015; Odukkathil and Vasudevan, 2016; Bhatt et al., 2021b; Lamilla et al., 2021).", "Looking at the grave danger of these toxic pollutants, there is an urgent need to deal with the harmful impacts of these toxic pesticides.

Biosurfactants consist of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions that are formed from amino acids, as well as saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, respectively (Sharma et al., 2015; Bhatt et al., 2021b), which enables a reduction in surface tension and reaching out between two solvate molecules, thus accelerates the solvation of hydrophobic molecules in aqueous media for emulsion formation (Banat, 1995; Lamilla et al., 2021). It has been observed that hydrocarbon-contaminated areas are the best places to isolate biosurfactant-producing microorganisms to improve pesticide remediation (Singh et al., 2016; Tan and Li, 2018; Bhatt et al., 2021a; Lamilla et al., 2021).

Organochlorine pesticides such as DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and Gammaxene were used extensively during the second world war, but they proved to be an ecological disaster for the world and was banned by the United States in 1972 due to their toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system and its non-biodegradable nature. Several developed and developing nations banned the use of most organochlorine pesticides, including DDT (Mansouri et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2020). This led to increased demand for organophosphate pesticides such as malathion, parathion, monocrotophos, etc., due to their wide action spectrum and moderate toxicity (Narenderan et al., 2020; Parks et al., 2021). However, feeding the exponentially growing population on declining land area forced farmers to use these pesticides more than the recommended dose i.e., 1 U.S liquid pints per acre of land or 0.473 liters per acre of land area (Tchounwou et al., 2015; As per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | US EPA, 2021). Insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, and fungicides are among the most regularly used pesticides (Malla et al., 2018) and were used excessively during the green revolution to increase productivity and reduce crop loss (Sarath Chandran et al., 2019). Pesticide use is rising and negatively influencing the environment, particularly the soil quality and health (Rawat et al., 2020), as only 1% of sprayed pesticides kill target species; the rest pollute the ecosystem by interacting with soil and generating more complex metabolites. For example, chlorpyrifos produces 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinon (TCP), an antimicrobial metabolite that kills beneficial soil microorganisms and due to its eco-toxicity, the United nation banned this pesticide in the year 2020. However, chlorpyrifos is extensively used in developing countries like India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan (John and Shaike, 2015; Shabbir et al., 2018; Kalyani et al., 2021). Pesticides strongly adsorb the soil\u2019s organic matter, which restricts its desorption. Most of the pesticides are non-polar compounds having hydrophobic properties and are insoluble in water (Bhatt et al., 2021b; Kalyani et al., 2021). Pesticides are highly recalcitrant on exposure to humans; they lead to several disorders related to the central nervous system as most of these chemicals inhibit acetylcholinesterase receptor activity, causing nerve damage. Apart from it, inhalation of pesticides leads to several respiratory disorders and these chemicals also have mutagenic and carcinogenic potential causing disorders related to fertility, excretory system, skin, and eye defects (Figure 1; Foong et al., 2020; Giri et al., 2020). According to reports on poisoning and the impact of synthetic chemicals on human health, numerous cases of intoxication of farmers, rural workers, and their families have occurred during pesticide applications.

These biosurfactants include glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycopeptides, glycosides, peptidoglycan, and lipopolysaccharides, which are the diverse forms of glycoconjugate-based biosurfactants (Varjani and Upasani, 2016; Bhatt et al., 2021b). One of the distinguishing features of biosurfactants is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), which determines the proportion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements in surface-active substances (Pacwa-P\u0142ociniczak et al., 2011). Biosurfactant activities are dependent on the concentration of surface-active molecules till the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is attained. Biosurfactant compounds form micelles, bilayers and vesicles at a concentration above CMC (Rasheed et al., 2020) and these micelles can reduce surface and interfacial tension and increase the solubility and bioavailability of hydrophobic pesticide molecules (Bhatt et al., 2021b). Surfactant efficiency is frequently measured using the CMC, as efficient biosurfactants have a low CMC, and require less biosurfactant to reduce surface tension (Pacwa-P\u0142ociniczak et al., 2011; Bhatt et al., 2021a,b).

The potential of rhamnolipid in bioremediation has been extensively studied in Pseudomonas and Burkholderia species (Varjani and Upasani, 2016). Rhamnolipids obtained from Pseudomonas aeruginosa enhance biodegradation of herbicide trifluralin and insecticide chlorpyrifos in the contaminated soil-water bodies (Singh et al., 2016; Tan and Li, 2018). It has been reported that the presence of glycolipid type of biosurfactant obtained from Pseudomonas species enhances solubilization of methyl parathion and endosulfan (Garc\u00eda-Reyes et al., 2018). With around 100 gL\u20131, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is regarded as the top rhamnolipid producer and it produces two forms of rhamnolipids in liquid suspension i.e., mono and di-rhamnolipid (Varjani and Upasani, 2016) by rhamnosyl transfer enzymatic reaction with the help of rhamnosyltransferase enzyme (Sober\u00f3n-Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2005; Varjani and Upasani, 2017). The hydrophobic and hydrophilic components of the rhamnolipid are formed due to a series of enzymatic processes that take place in microbes. After synthesis, the two halves of the lipid are linked together to form mono- and di-rhamnolipids, respectively (Bhatt et al., 2019). A rhamnolipid was formed from an axenic culture of Pseudomonas putida strain DOT-T1E, which aided in the bioremediation of chlorinated phenols (Maia et al., 2019). The trapping of the chlorophenol in the biosurfactant micelles, as well as the hydrophobic connection between these two types of molecules, are at the heart of this action. Likewise, actinobacteria-formed biosurfactant accelerates the bioremediation of xenobiotics (Sponza and Gok, 2011). In the bioremediation of carbendazim with Rhodococcus species D-1, rhamnolipids were found efficient. With the highest bioremediation efficiency, the rhamnolipid altered carbendazim degradation in a concentration-dependent manner. It aided carbendazim transesterification and favorable cell surface modification, allowing it to enter Rhodococcus species D-1 cells, which were degraded (Bai et al., 2017). Glucolipid type of biosurfactant produced by Burkholderia cenocepacia BSP3 complements the solubilization of pesticide (Bustamante et al., 2012).

The amount of biosurfactant is also vital for microbial development. High quantities of these biosurfactants inhibit microbial growth and breakdown. These findings may not apply to all microbial strains. A study shows that biosurfactant addition increased 30% endosulfan degradation with the help of Bacillus subtilis MTCC 1427 in the soil and aqueous solution (Zhou et al., 2011). Endosulfan isomers were found to have more significant mobilization and accessibility in the presence of biosurfactant, which could be due to pesticide solubilization or improved attraction for micro-organism cells. Due to the formation of rhamnolipids by P. aeruginosa, the soil adulterated with endosulfan showed accelerated degradation after 7 days of the experiment (Madamwar et al., 2021). The published article indicated that the Pseudomonas strain BO406 produced a raw extract of a biosurfactant (glycolipid) that aided in the solubilization of endosulfan (Garc\u00eda-Reyes et al., 2018). The strain of Lysinibacillus sphaericus IITR51 was used by researchers to develop a thermostable rhamnolipid biosurfactant capable of increasing the solubility of the highly hydrophobic pesticides such as endosulfan and HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) (Manickam et al., 2012; Gaur et al., 2019). A strain of Pseudomonas SB can produce a biosurfactant that enhances DDT breakdown. Rhamnolipid has been reported to increase DDT degradation by 64% from 52% without rhamnolipid (Bhatt et al., 2021b). Studies on mixed consortia of Pleurotus ostreatus (white-rot fungus), Bacillus subtilis, and P. aeruginosa have produced biosurfactants that improve DDT biodegradation (Purnomo et al., 2017; Bhatt et al., 2021b).

Similarly, introducing rhamnolipid to Rhodococcus species-D1 resulted in increased carbendazim biodegradation. The addition of rhamnolipid to the soil resulted in around 24\u201335% biodegradation of trifluralin (Bai et al., 2017).

Thus, in screening, it is likely that novel gene clusters involved in biosurfactant production from soil and aquatic microbial assemblages will be discovered, speeding up the development of bioremediation technologies involving biosurfactants in pesticide-contaminated environments (Hemmat-Jou et al., 2018; Ta\u015f et al., 2021). The whole workflow of metagenomics investigation of biosurfactant producing microbes is presented in Figure 6.", "The use of function-based metagenomic strategies can be a potent tool in helping to exploit the unique microbial diversity of pesticide-contaminated environments, thereby assisting in the ongoing search for novel biosurfactants with potentially important bioremediation applications (Yadav et al., 2019; Ta\u015f et al., 2021). Most research on biosurfactant producing microbes has been limited to soil isolates, primarily from the Pseudomonas and Bacillus species. However, with the help of metagenomics, it has recently been discovered that a diverse group of soil and marine microbes can produce biosurfactants (Dhanjal and Sharma, 2018; Guerra et al., 2018; Garg et al., 2021) and some of these biosurfactants have shown potential in bioremediation of pesticides (Kennedy et al., 2011; Ghosh and Das, 2018).

These investigations helped in finding two novel biosurfactants; palmitoyl putrescine and N-acyl amino acids (Jackson et al., 2015; Williams and Trindade, 2017; Hu et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2020b). Given the amount and diversity of biosurfactant synthesizing microbes found in cultured isolates, it is believed that employing metagenomics to investigate the even larger uncultured component of the microbial community will lead to major novel biosurfactant discoveries (Datta et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020b). A group of researchers identified a new gene involved in biosurfactant synthesis and helps in hydrocarbon degradation. They named it MBSP1 (Carla da Silva Ara\u00fajo et al., 2020) (metagenomic biosurfactant protein 1) (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2020). Thies et al. (2016) conducted a metagenomic study by collecting samples from the drain of the slaughterhouse that was rich in microbes belonging to flavobacteriaceae and, through NMR-spectroscopy identified novel biosurfactant as N-acyltyrosines along with N-myristoyl-tyrosine as the dominant species (Thies et al., 2016). Metagenomics delivers an adequate metagenomic database that will give a substantial stock of genes to develop novel microbial strains for targeted application in biosurfactant production and bioremediation (Malla et al., 2018; Datta et al., 2020; Douglas et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021b). Metagenomics coupled with bioinformatics removes all the obstacles faced in the process of genomic studies such as phylogenetic analysis, taxonomic profiling, molecular phylogeny, functional characterization of metagenomes, and enzymes and system biology studies, including genetic engineering through CRISPR or TALEN (Singh et al., 2020b). Quite a few bioinformatic pipelines have been developed (Table 2), such as QIIME (quantitative insights into microbial ecology), PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states), MG-RAST (metagenomic rapid annotations using subsystems technology), Mothur, CLARK, MetaPhlAn2 (metagenomic phylogenetic analysis), MICCA, Metaphyler, MOCAT2, TIPP2, mOTUsv2, Bracken, etc., for sequence classification and taxonomic profiling of metagenomic data (Liu et al., 2010; Albanese et al., 2015; Truong et al., 2015; Douglas et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020b).
