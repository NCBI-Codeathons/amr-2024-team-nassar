["Aspergillus flavus, the primary causal agent for aflatoxin contamination on crops, consists of isolates with two distinct morphologies: isolates of the S morphotype produce numerous small sclerotia and lower numbers of conidia while isolates of the L morphotype produce fewer large sclerotia and abundant conidia. The morphotypes also differ in aflatoxin production with S isolates consistently producing high concentrations of aflatoxin, whereas L isolates range from atoxigenic to highly toxigenic. The production of abundant sclerotia by the S morphotype suggests adaptation for long-term survival in the soil, whereas the production of abundant conidia by the L morphotype suggests adaptation for aerial dispersal to the phyllosphere. To identify genomic changes that support differential niche adaption, the sequences of three S and three L morphotype isolates were compared. Differences in genome structure and gene content were identified between the morphotypes. A >530 kb inversion between the morphotypes affect a secondary metabolite gene cluster and a cutinase gene. The morphotypes also differed in proteins predicted to be involved in carbon/nitrogen metabolism, iron acquisition, antimicrobial defense, and evasion of host immunity. The S morphotype genomes contained more intact secondary metabolite clusters indicating there is higher selection pressure to maintain secondary metabolism in the soil and that it is not limited to aflatoxin production. The L morphotype genomes were enriched in amino acid transporters, suggesting efficient nitrogen transport may be critical in the nutrient limited phyllosphere. These findings indicate the genomes of the two morphotypes differ beyond developmental genes and have diverged as they adapted to their respective niches.", "The saprotrophic fungus, Aspergillus flavus, is the primary causal agent of contamination in food crops by aflatoxins, highly carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced by members of the genus Aspergillus section Flavi (Schroeder and Boller 1973; Klich 2002; Klich 2007; Mehl et al., 2012). Aflatoxin contamination causes both economic losses and health problems in both humans and animals. This is a serious problem in developing countries where aflatoxin contamination is not regulated; aflatoxin-contaminated food and feed result in loss of export sales and health problems ranging from stunting of growth, immune suppression, cancer and in acute cases, death (Goldblatt 1969; Bennett and Klich 2003; Probst et al., 2007; Richard et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2004). Repeated aflatoxicosis outbreaks have occurred in Kenya, and in 2004, one of the largest documented outbreaks resulted in a total of 317 cases being reported and 125 deaths (CDC, 2004; Probst et al., 2007). In developed countries, regulations for aflatoxin levels in food protect consumers from aflatoxin poisoning, but great economic losses are incurred as contaminated crops must be destroyed or de-contaminated (Richard et al., 2003; Mitchell et al., 2016).", "Although A. flavus is notorious for its ability to produce aflatoxin, isolates within the species vary in levels of toxin production and atoxigenic isolates are not uncommon. Within A. flavus are isolates with two distinct morphologies, the S (small sclerotia) and L (large sclerotia) morphotypes (Cotty 1989), characterized by sclerotial size. S morphotype isolates produce numerous small sclerotia and conidiate poorly, whereas L morphotype isolates produce relatively fewer large sclerotia and abundant conidia (Cotty 1989; Figure 1). The morphotypes differ in toxigenicity as well: S isolates are consistently toxigenic, whereas L isolates vary greatly in toxin production ranging from atoxigenic to highly toxigenic isolates (Saito et al., 1986; Cotty 1989). On average, S isolates produce higher levels of aflatoxin than L isolates (Cotty 1989; Cotty 1997; Probst et al., 2010) and have etiological implications as causal agents in outbreaks (Cotty 1997; Garber and Cotty 1997; Bock et al., 2004; Probst et al., 2007; Cotty et al., 2008). Atoxigenic L isolates are of particular importance as successful biological control agents that outcompete toxigenic isolates from contaminating crops (Garber and Cotty 1997; Cotty et al., 2008; Mehl et al., 2012).", "Figure 1Colony morphology of A. flavus isolates used in genomic analyses of this study.

A study by Sweany et al. (2011) provides support for this differential reproductive strategy: they report that more than 95% of isolates recovered from maize kernels in a study in Louisiana were of L morphotype, whereas only 44% of soil isolates were of L morphotype with the remainder consisting of S morphotype. A similar pattern was observed when comparing the frequency of S isolates and L isolates recovered from maize kernels and groundnut in Malawi (Ching\u2019anda et al., 2016). Differences in aflatoxin toxigenicity observed between the morphotypes also suggest differential niche adaptation; S isolates are consistently highly toxigenic, while L isolates vary in their toxigenicity including atoxigenic and low toxin-producing isolates. This suggests selection pressure to maintain aflatoxin production varies between the soil and phyllosphere with pressure being high in the soil, leading to the retention of toxigenic S isolates, while it is lower in the phyllosphere allowing the survival of atoxigenic or low toxin-producing L isolates (Mehl et al., 2012). This is also evidenced by lower proportions of atoxigenic isolates recovered from soil than from the phyllosphere (Bilgrami and Choudhary 1993; Sweany et al., 2011).", "In this study, we compared the genomes of S and L morphotype isolates to test the hypothesis that there are genomic differences that reflect their adaptation to the soil and phyllosphere respectively. The soil and phyllosphere are contrasting environments in terms of ambient conditions, nutrient availability, and microbial competition. The soil is buffered from changes in the atmosphere in contrast to the phyllosphere where microbes are exposed to high levels of ultraviolet light and fluctuations in temperature (Lindow and Brandl 2003; Whipps et al., 2008; Vorholt 2012; Bulgarelli et al., 2013; Bringel and Cou\u00e9e 2015). Nutrient availability is greater in the soil than the phyllosphere due to the presence of root exudates and degradation of organic matter by microorganisms (Rengel and Marschner 2005; Turner et al., 2013; Dotaniya and Meena 2015). In contrast, the leaf surface is covered by a waxy cuticle layer that limits passive diffusion of water and nutrients (Whipps et al., 2008; Vorholt 2012; Bringel and Cou\u00e9e 2015). In recent years, metagenomic studies of the soil/rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbiomes show evidence that microbial communities that inhabit these niches are different as well (Delmotte et al., 2009; Knief et al., 2012; Lundberg et al., 2012). The soil environment is rich, not only with microbes, but also with small animals such as insects and worms . On the other hand, species diversity on leaf surfaces is relatively low, with bacteria being the most abundant organisms (Lindow and Brandl 2003; Delmotte et al., 2009). Therefore, if the S and L morphotypes are adapted to the soil and phyllosphere respectively, they would require different mechanisms to withstand abiotic stresses, acquire nutrients, and compete or defend against organisms they encounter. Here we identify genomic differences between the A. flavus morphotypes that we propose have allowed them to selectively adapt to their respective niches.", "Methods and Materials", "Methods and Materials", "Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation", "Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation", "Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation", "The genomes of three S morphotype isolates (AF12, AF70, and AZS; Figure 1; Table S1) and three L morphotype isolates (BS01, DV901, and MC04; Figure 1; Table S1) were 2 \u00d7 100 bp paired-end sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (San Diego, CA) platform at the Arizona Genomics Institute.

Inversions are major drivers of adaptation and speciation in various organisms (Kirkpatrick and Barton 2006; Hoffmann and Rieseberg 2008; Kirkpatrick 2010) by impacting homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis that can result in reduced fertility and reproductive isolation (Hoffmann and Rieseberg 2008). Our phylogenetic analysis of A. flavus S and L morphotype taxa from diverse geographic regions does not resolve whether the morphotypes form monophyletic clades due to limited sample size, but does indicate the S and L isolates used in the genomic analyses belong to two distinct clades. The inversion may have resulted in limited gene flow between the morphotypes leading to distinct lineages. Inversions can also result in fortuitous changes via gene disruption or altered gene regulation at the breakpoints (Kirkpatrick and Barton 2006). In the S morphotype, there are two secondary metabolite gene clusters at the inversion breakpoints; if the compounds produced by these clusters are advantageous for microbial competition in the soil, the S inversion configuration would be advantageous for soil survival. In contrast, in the L morphotype, one of the inversion breakpoints encodes a cutinase gene, which may be favorable for nutrient acquisition in the phyllosphere. Finally, inversions can suppress recombination within the inverted region leading to maintenance of divergent allele combinations that could be advantageous in contrasting niches (Kirkpatrick and Barton 2006; Hoffmann and Rieseberg 2008; Kirkpatrick 2010). In both the S and L morphotypes, the inverted region contains genes under selection and morphotype-unique genes. In the inverted region of the S morphotype, a eukaryotic elongation factor 5A hypusine gene is under selection-and four S morphotype-unique proteins are present (a cytochrome p450, a hexapeptide repeat of succinyl transferase, a UbiA prenyltransferase, and an unknown protein). The L morphotype has one unique protein (protein with an FAD binding domain) in the inverted region. The region may also contain genes with adaptive allelic differences between the morphotypes that were not identified to be under selection.

In the S morphotype, there are two secondary metabolite gene clusters at the inversion breakpoints; if the compounds produced by these clusters are advantageous for microbial competition in the soil, the S inversion configuration would be advantageous for soil survival. In contrast, in the L morphotype, one of the inversion breakpoints encodes a cutinase gene, which may be favorable for nutrient acquisition in the phyllosphere. Finally, inversions can suppress recombination within the inverted region leading to maintenance of divergent allele combinations that could be advantageous in contrasting niches (Kirkpatrick and Barton 2006; Hoffmann and Rieseberg 2008; Kirkpatrick 2010). In both the S and L morphotypes, the inverted region contains genes under selection and morphotype-unique genes. In the inverted region of the S morphotype, a eukaryotic elongation factor 5A hypusine gene is under selection-and four S morphotype-unique proteins are present (a cytochrome p450, a hexapeptide repeat of succinyl transferase, a UbiA prenyltransferase, and an unknown protein). The L morphotype has one unique protein (protein with an FAD binding domain) in the inverted region. The region may also contain genes with adaptive allelic differences between the morphotypes that were not identified to be under selection. Suppressed recombination within the inversion could maintain these gene and allelic differences between the morphotypes. However, elucidation of mechanisms and extent to which these differences play a functional role in niche adaptation will require validation.", "In addition to the inversion creating differences in secondary metabolite clusters, the number of deletions within secondary metabolite clusters also differs between the morphotypes with more intact clusters present in the S morphotype. The L morphotype contains seven deletions within secondary metabolite clusters relative to the S morphotype, including the deletion of two PKS genes. In contrast, the S morphotype contains one deletion within secondary metabolite clusters relative to the L morphotype; however, this deletion is within the cypA gene of the aflatoxin gene cluster in which both S and L isolates have deletions with the S isolates having a larger deletion. Therefore, both morphotypes have defective cypA genes resulting in the loss of aflatoxin G production (Ehrlich et al., 2004; Probst et al., 2012; Probst et al., 2014; Adhikari et al., 2016). The differences in deletions within secondary metabolite clusters suggest the S morphotype is under higher selective pressure to maintain secondary metabolite production, consistent with the pressure to maintain aflatoxin production. Polyketide biosynthetic genes are enriched in metagenomes of soil bacteria as well (Tringe et al. 2005). The extra intact clusters in the S morphotype may produce antimicrobial compounds, signaling molecules, or chelating agents (Demain and Fang 2000) that could be advantageous for competition against the more plentiful and diverse microbes in the soil compared to the phyllosphere (Delmotte et al., 2009; Knief et al., 2012).", "In addition to the inversion creating differences in secondary metabolite clusters, the number of deletions within secondary metabolite clusters also differs between the morphotypes with more intact clusters present in the S morphotype.

Our genomic comparisons indicate there are differences in gene regulation, antimicrobial activity, resistance to natural compounds and toxic chemicals, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, iron acquisition, and secondary metabolite production between the morphotypes. We have proposed how these differences could be advantageous for niche adaptation and have provided a foundation for experiments to determine the relevance of the genomic differences in niche adaptation. Functional validation of these genes is necessary as well as examination of additional S and L isolates to extend these results. Furthermore, many of the morphotype-unique proteins did not have predicted functions or domains, therefore, functional analysis of these via knockout or knock-in experiments would help in defining their potential roles in niche adaptation of the two morphotypes.", "In summary, we have used comparative genomics to test the hypothesis that the S and L morphotypes have genetic differences that could play a role in differential adaptation to the soil and phyllosphere, respectively.
