["With the advancements of science, antibiotics have emerged as an amazing gift to the human and animal healthcare sectors for the treatment of bacterial infections and other diseases. However, the evolution of new bacterial strains, along with excessive use and reckless consumption of antibiotics have led to the unfolding of antibiotic resistances to an excessive level. Multidrug resistance is a potential threat worldwide, and is escalating at an extremely high rate. Information related to drug resistance, and its regulation and control are still very little. To interpret the onset of antibiotic resistances, investigation on molecular analysis of resistance genes, their distribution and mechanisms are urgently required. Fine-tuned research and resistance profile regarding ESKAPE pathogen is also necessary along with other multidrug resistant bacteria. In the present scenario, the interaction of bacterial infections with SARS-CoV-2 is also crucial. Tracking and in-silico analysis of various resistance mechanisms or gene/s are crucial for overcoming the problem, and thus, the maintenance of relevant databases and wise use of antibiotics should be promoted. Creating awareness of this critical situation among individuals at every level is important to strengthen the fight against this fast-growing calamity. The review aimed to provide detailed information on antibiotic resistance, its regulatory molecular mechanisms responsible for the resistance, and other relevant information. In this article, we tried to focus on the correlation between antimicrobial resistance and the COVID-19 pandemic. This study will help in developing new interventions, potential approaches, and strategies to handle the complexity of antibiotic resistance and prevent the incidences of life-threatening infections.", "1.

Antibiotic resistance is not only a major complication: antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is also one of the top ten global public health concerns flourishing all over the world. Antibiotics, antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitics are commonly known as antimicrobials. The scenario regarding the adverse effects of resistance is much bigger than its imagination. Antiviral drug resistance is also increasing at an alarming rate, and has become a concern for immunocompromised patients. Antiretroviral drugs are one of the best examples of this problem. Drug resistance to malaria parasites and fungal infections are increasing and infuriating the treatment situation. Dated back in May 2015, the WHO has developed Global Action Plan on AMR with five objectives to fight steps against AMR [3,4].

Few environmental bacteria are also believed to acquire antibiotic resistance determinants, which could be due to co-existence/evolution or horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [11,12]. Thus, all of these factors, along with the excessive use of antibiotics, are responsible for the emergence of resistance in isolates [13].

The origin of antibiotics dates back a few decades, and since then they have been playing an important role in impeding the growth of pathogenic microbes. Antibiotic resistance emerged in the 1960s, when various enteric and other gram-negative bacteria developed resistance toward highly used drugs. Overall, three major elements of AMR development are emergence, transmission, and level of infection. For example, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N.\ngonorrhoeae) developed resistance to ampicillin, and Haemophilus developed resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol [18,19]. Similarly, sulfonamide resistance originated in the 1940s, and soon after the origin of sulfonamide resistance, pharmaceutical companies and researchers had to face another hurdle when aminoglycoside-resistant S. aureus came into existence. Afterwards, with the development of new antibiotics, such as methicillin, vancomycin, and fluoroquinolones, the emergence of resistance to these antibiotics also developed gradually; methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains are among the rapidly propagating bacterial strains [20].", "The discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming was a pillar for the foundation of the modern era of treatment for bacterial infections [17].

Natural/Intrinsic Resistance", "Intrinsic resistance can be defined as the ability of a bacterium to resist the effect of an antibiotic due to its inherent properties. An excellent example of an intrinsic resistance mechanism is the absence of a susceptible target site for a particular antibiotic in Pseudomonas. Triclosan, a broad-spectrum biocide especially against gram-positive bacteria and several gram-negative bacteria, is incapable of preventing the growth of Pseudomonas. Initially, the resistance was supposed to be due to active efflux, but later on, the presence of fabI (insensitive allele) which encodes an extra enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase enzyme, a target site for triclosan, was reported [46]. Similarly, lipopeptide daptomycin, approved in 2003 for clinical practice, is an active drug against gram-positive bacteria (36). However, it is ineffective against gram-negative bacteria. The cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative bacteria contains the lesser proportion of anionic phospholipids than gram-positive bacteria. Thus, the efficacy of Ca2+ mediated daptomycin insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane is decreased [47]. Additionally, some antibacterial compounds that are unable to cross the outer membrane are considered as a means of intrinsic resistance. In gram-positive bacteria, vancomycin inhibits peptidoglycan crosslinking by targeting D-Ala-D-Ala peptides, whereas, in the case of gram-negative bacteria, vancomycin cannot pass through the outer membrane. The synthesis of \u03b2-lactamases (e.g., extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases [ESBLs] enzymes, carbapenemases, and metallo-\u03b2-lactamases) has reportedly increased the rate of acquired MDR infections, and it has particularly led to third-generation cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance. Notably, various genes associated with intrinsic resistance to different classes of antibiotics such as lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones in P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) have been identified through high-throughput tools of high-density genome mutant libraries [48]. Genes responsible for drug-resistant Salmonella and E. coli include AmpC, bla-TEM-1, bla-CTX- M-15, VIM-1, NDM-1, floR, tetG, and the mcr-1 gene that encodes colistin drug resistance [49]. As an example, the inactivation of redundant E. coli genes enabled the identification of putative targets, such as FabI, SapC, RecQ, TrxA (thioredoxin), TrxB (thioredoxin reductase), DacA, and D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase, for susceptibility phenotyping. Inhibition of these genes may significantly stimulate the activity of drugs such as triclosan, rifampicin, aminoglycosides, nitrofurantoin, and some \u03b2-lactams. Bacteria may acquire antibiotic resistance through various other mechanisms, such as antibiotic efflux or poor drug penetration resulting in the reduction of the intracellular concentration of antibiotic, modification of the antibiotic target site due to posttranslational target modification or genetic mutation of the target, and inactivation of antibiotics through modification or hydrolysis [32,50]. Plasmid coding colistin-resistant (mcr-1 dependent) E. coli was first isolated from raw meat, animals, and humans in China [51]; Mcr-1 harboring E. coli was also reported in migratory birds and human clinical isolates in Pakistan and MDR (ESBLs, quinolones). E. coli was reported from poultry farms, wild birds, pigeons, dogs, and humans [52], as a few examples. N. gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to sulphonamides, penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and early generation cephalosporins [53].

Inhibition of these genes may significantly stimulate the activity of drugs such as triclosan, rifampicin, aminoglycosides, nitrofurantoin, and some \u03b2-lactams. Bacteria may acquire antibiotic resistance through various other mechanisms, such as antibiotic efflux or poor drug penetration resulting in the reduction of the intracellular concentration of antibiotic, modification of the antibiotic target site due to posttranslational target modification or genetic mutation of the target, and inactivation of antibiotics through modification or hydrolysis [32,50]. Plasmid coding colistin-resistant (mcr-1 dependent) E. coli was first isolated from raw meat, animals, and humans in China [51]; Mcr-1 harboring E. coli was also reported in migratory birds and human clinical isolates in Pakistan and MDR (ESBLs, quinolones). E. coli was reported from poultry farms, wild birds, pigeons, dogs, and humans [52], as a few examples. N. gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to sulphonamides, penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and early generation cephalosporins [53]. Apart from rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) strains also show multi-drug resistance and pose a major risk factor for the treatment of tuberculosis [54].", "Intrinsic resistance can be defined as the ability of a bacterium to resist the effect of an antibiotic due to its inherent properties. An excellent example of an intrinsic resistance mechanism is the absence of a susceptible target site for a particular antibiotic in Pseudomonas. Triclosan, a broad-spectrum biocide especially against gram-positive bacteria and several gram-negative bacteria, is incapable of preventing the growth of Pseudomonas. Initially, the resistance was supposed to be due to active efflux, but later on, the presence of fabI (insensitive allele) which encodes an extra enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase enzyme, a target site for triclosan, was reported [46]. Similarly, lipopeptide daptomycin, approved in 2003 for clinical practice, is an active drug against gram-positive bacteria (36). However, it is ineffective against gram-negative bacteria. The cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative bacteria contains the lesser proportion of anionic phospholipids than gram-positive bacteria. Thus, the efficacy of Ca2+ mediated daptomycin insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane is decreased [47]. Additionally, some antibacterial compounds that are unable to cross the outer membrane are considered as a means of intrinsic resistance. In gram-positive bacteria, vancomycin inhibits peptidoglycan crosslinking by targeting D-Ala-D-Ala peptides, whereas, in the case of gram-negative bacteria, vancomycin cannot pass through the outer membrane. The synthesis of \u03b2-lactamases (e.g., extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases [ESBLs] enzymes, carbapenemases, and metallo-\u03b2-lactamases) has reportedly increased the rate of acquired MDR infections, and it has particularly led to third-generation cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance. Notably, various genes associated with intrinsic resistance to different classes of antibiotics such as lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones in P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) have been identified through high-throughput tools of high-density genome mutant libraries [48]. Genes responsible for drug-resistant Salmonella and E. coli include AmpC, bla-TEM-1, bla-CTX- M-15, VIM-1, NDM-1, floR, tetG, and the mcr-1 gene that encodes colistin drug resistance [49].

Initially, around 87.7% of COVID-19 patients were treated with antibiotics, whereas only 6.9% of patients were co-infected with bacteria or had a secondary infection. The unnecessary use of antibiotics must be reduced; increasing the rate of vaccination and other treatment options is necessary to combat COVID-19.

However, the use of antimicrobials for severe COVID-19 patients is used to combat the pathogens [78].
