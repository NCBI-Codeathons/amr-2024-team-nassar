["Antibiotics have revolutionized medicine, saving countless lives since their discovery in the early 20th century. However, the origin of antibiotics is now overshadowed by the alarming rise in antibiotic resistance. This global crisis stems from the relentless adaptability of microorganisms, driven by misuse and overuse of antibiotics. This article explores the origin of antibiotics and the subsequent emergence of antibiotic resistance. It delves into the mechanisms employed by bacteria to develop resistance, highlighting the dire consequences of drug resistance, including compromised patient care, increased mortality rates, and escalating healthcare costs. The article elucidates the latest strategies against drug-resistant microorganisms, encompassing innovative approaches such as phage therapy, CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and the exploration of natural compounds. Moreover, it examines the profound impact of antibiotic resistance on drug development, rendering the pursuit of new antibiotics economically challenging. The limitations and challenges in developing novel antibiotics are discussed, along with hurdles in the regulatory process that hinder progress in this critical field. Proposals for modifying the regulatory process to facilitate antibiotic development are presented. The withdrawal of major pharmaceutical firms from antibiotic research is examined, along with potential strategies to re-engage their interest. The article also outlines initiatives to overcome economic challenges and incentivize antibiotic development, emphasizing international collaborations and partnerships. Finally, the article sheds light on government-led initiatives against antibiotic resistance, with a specific focus on the Middle East. It discusses the proactive measures taken by governments in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to combat this global threat. In the face of antibiotic resistance, a multifaceted approach is imperative. This article provides valuable insights into the complex landscape of antibiotic development, regulatory challenges, and collaborative efforts required to ensure a future where antibiotics remain effective tools in safeguarding public health.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Among the greatest discoveries of humankind in the 20th century was the discovery of antibiotics. Antibacterial triumph changed contemporary biomedicine and seeks to define, mold, and grow both its potential and its boundaries. Regrettably, the possibility for resistance to any therapeutic agent to evolve limits its ability to be effective [1,2]. The next series of antibiotics must be developed, since resistance compromises efficacy (therapeutic effect). A pathogen\u2019s enhanced resistance to the prescribed standard therapy to which it was previously vulnerable is referred to as tolerance to an antibacterial agent (in this case, an antibiotic) [3,4,5].", "Among the greatest discoveries of humankind in the 20th century was the discovery of antibiotics.

The introduction of the term \u201cantibiotics\u201d was the result of pioneering work by American microbiologist Selman Waksman and his team, who successfully isolated chemical substances from microorganisms capable of inhibiting the growth of other microbes [7]. While the concept of using microorganisms to combat infections has ancient roots, it was Alexander Fleming\u2019s serendipitous discovery of penicillin in 1928 that marked the inception of modern antibiotic therapy [8].

Microbial strains may possess inherent resistance or react strongly to transgene expression from one bacterium to another via plasmids, transgenes, genetic elements, and phages, or through alterations in cell genes (chromatin instability) that result in cross-resistance [23]. Resistant microorganisms may proliferate swiftly if resistance factors are present on plasmids.

Genetic mutations can occur through five mechanisms: substitution, deletion, addition, inversion, and duplication. For example, spontaneous resistance to fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin can develop due to mutations in the DNA gyrase coding genes gyrA and gyrB [33,34]. Similarly, resistance of pathogenic bacteria to macrolides (such as erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, troleandomycin, etc.) may result from mutational changes in specific nucleotides of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) 23S sequence [35,36]. Another mechanism of resistance includes plasmid transfer, and that is likely the most crucial; it can end up supplying the host organism and its offspring with additional genetic information expressing antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics have an impact on this by causing the transmission of resistant genes among microbes as well as by applying selection pressure towards the development of resistant bacteria. Other antibiotic-resistant strains transfer the genes encoding resistance for particular antibiotics, which evolve through mutation [37,38] and those genes are associated with the antibiotic biosynthesis pathway either in clusters or as single genes. As evidence from Streptomyces coelicolor predicted, the degree of antibiotic resistance is linked with the antibiotic biosynthetic gene as it determines the role of antibiotic resistance determinants and postulates about the biosynthetic pathway of antibiotics [39]. Even in isolates that do not generate antibiotic-resistant genes, they are usually present. As a result, bacteria have developed a wide range of genes (known as the \u201cresistome\u201d) that shield them from the effective dose of antibiotics. Clinically relevant resistant infections contain mobility genetic elements with genes orthologous to these on them. There is a chance that the genes that help compensate for this external resistance will spread to pathogens, and there is some proof at least that many significant clinical gene mutations have their roots in environmental microorganisms [40].", "Genetic mutations: Antibiotic resistance also emerges through the genetic mutations encoded on the bacterial chromosome, which occur due to the evolution of genetic material against antibiotics and its transfer to the next generation (Figure 2).

Mutations in these target sites can alter the structure of the binding site, reducing the affinity of the antibiotic for its target and rendering it less effective. As a result, the bacterium becomes less susceptible to the antibiotic\u2019s action, leading to resistance. Additionally, mutations can also upregulate efflux pumps\u2014specialized proteins that actively pump antibiotics out of the bacterial cell before they can exert their effects. For instance, mutations in the \u03b2-subunit of RNA polymerase gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis can lead to resistance against the antibiotic rifampicin [42].

Randomized uncontrolled evolution really cannot explain the high probability of survival on lower antimicrobial agents. It was instead proposed that the genes for resistance to antibiotics were obtained through epigenetic mechanisms. Because of the maintenance of specific chromatin configurations or DNA methylation states, the high rate of reversal of these resistive phenotypes further demonstrated that it was an instance of epigenetic mechanisms, which do not confer a durable phenotype [46].", "Epigenetic mechanisms: The antibiotic resistance genes and their epigenetic inheritance-based evolution have been found first in isolated strains of Escherichia coli, which have been exposed to different concentrations of antibiotics including tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and ampicillin [44,45].

Conjugation is the mechanism by which DNA is transferred from cell to cell via cell surface pili or adhesins. It is aided by conjugative machinery, which is encoded by genes on autonomously replicating plasmids or integrative conjugative elements in the chromosome. The challenges of antibiotic resistance (AR) in hospital settings are further complicated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and this is prominently illustrated in the context of plasmid-mediated resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Resistance mechanisms involving extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemase, for instance, operate by breaking down \u03b2-lactam antibiotics like penicillin, carbapenems, and cephalosporins [50]. Notably, \u03b2-lactam resistance genes are frequently situated on plasmids, leading to their dissemination through conjugation within and between different species, particularly within the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter families [51,52,53,54,55].", "Conjugation: Conjugation, which is one of the mechanism of HGT, is believed to have the biggest impact on the spread of ARGs among the three recognized canonical mechanisms of HGT.

Currently, there is only indirect evidence of transduction occurring in hospital settings. For instance, in the case of hospital-acquired MRSA infections, bacteriophages extracted from these infections were observed to efficiently transduce antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to susceptible strains under laboratory conditions (as reported in [57]). Similarly, instances of transduction between hospital isolates of S. aureus have been documented, where tetracycline and penicillin resistance genes were transferred [58]. In Gram-negative bacteria, laboratory studies have demonstrated the transference of multiple ARGs, including extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) genes, from Pseudomonas hospital isolates to other Pseudomonas strains [59]. Additionally, \u03b2-lactamase genes have been shown to undergo transduction between Acinetobacter strains in controlled settings [60]. It is worth noting that the CTX-M family of ESBL genes, typically carried on plasmids, is believed to have originated in Kluyvera, a relatively infrequent pathogen within the Enterobacteriaceae family (10.1086/322686). The horizontal transfer of ESBL genes from minor pathogens like Kluyvera has led to the extensive spread of CTX-M variants among clinically significant E. coli and Klebsiella strains [61,62]. Certain bacteria appeared to be capable of uptake, integration, and functional expression of naked extracellular DNA fragments, a process known as (natural) transformation. Several antibiotic-resistant pathogens with clinical relevance possess the ability to uptake DNA and undergo natural transformation. These include Acinetobacter, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus, as detailed in References [63,64]. Frederick Griffith\u2019s groundbreaking work demonstrated that nonvirulent Streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transform into virulent pathogens within infected mice, as reported in [65]. Similarly, research has shown that Helicobacter pylori can acquire genes through natural competence and undergo transformation, both in colonized humans and in mouse infection models, as documented in [66,67].", "Transformation and transduction: While transformation and transduction (two other mechanisms of HGT) are assumed to be less crucial, recent studies indicate that their involvement may be more substantial than previously thought [56]. Currently, there is only indirect evidence of transduction occurring in hospital settings. For instance, in the case of hospital-acquired MRSA infections, bacteriophages extracted from these infections were observed to efficiently transduce antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to susceptible strains under laboratory conditions (as reported in [57]). Similarly, instances of transduction between hospital isolates of S. aureus have been documented, where tetracycline and penicillin resistance genes were transferred [58]. In Gram-negative bacteria, laboratory studies have demonstrated the transference of multiple ARGs, including extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) genes, from Pseudomonas hospital isolates to other Pseudomonas strains [59].

Bacteriophages can transfer genes that are beneficial to their microbial hosts via specialized or generalized transduction, so enhancing their own survival and spread [68]. The mobilization or transfer of ARGs by bacteriophages has been described for a variety of bacterial species, including the transduction of erythromycin, tetracycline, or multiple resistances across S. pyogenes strains and the transfer of antibiotic resistance plasmids in MRSA [69].", "Bacteriophages have a significant impact on the bacterial microbiome in any setting.

This phase of the bacterium also influences its susceptibility to antibiotics, with sometimes high resistivity exhibited by the stationary phase as compared to the growing phase. The production of biofilm in the micro environment during the stationary phase can contribute to the resistance towards antibiotics. Biofilms are structured communities of bacteria embedded within a self-produced extracellular matrix. Biofilm formation enables bacteria to adhere to surfaces and protect themselves from antibiotics and the immune system. Within a biofilm, bacteria can communicate through a process called quorum sensing, allowing them to coordinate their resistance mechanisms. This can lead to higher antibiotic tolerance than individual planktonic (free-floating) cells. The protective matrix of the biofilm can hinder the penetration of antibiotics, making it difficult for drugs to reach and kill the bacteria within. Biofilm generation is especially concerning in clinical settings, since it impedes antibiotic treatment of infections due to the facilitated acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). One such example is chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis patients, wherein Pseudomonas aeruginosa often forms biofilms in the airways of patients. Within the biofilm, P. aeruginosa cells exhibit increased resistance to antibiotics, as the biofilm matrix prevents antibiotics from effectively penetrating and reaching the bacterial cells, allowing the infection to persist and become chronic despite treatment. The intercellular signaling mechanism within Pseudomonas aeruginosa regulates the expression of genes associated with superoxide dismutase and catalase, ultimately influencing resistance to hydrogen peroxides [70]. Environmental factors are now recognized as critical in driving biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance development, and spread. Several studies have shown that environmental biofilms might act as hotspots for the spread of ARGs [71]. The reduction in nitrogen production also triggers resistance to antibiotics, which is also called swarming [32]. The swarming cells of bacteria posed resistance to a variety of antibiotics. These data, along with the susceptibility seen in biofilm, strongly suggest that antimicrobial resistance is a result of bacterial social behavior [72,73].", "Biofilm Formation: In some cases, the antibiotic resistance and tolerance of bacteria to certain antibiotics depends on their metabolic state.

The most probable reason for this disparity is that while MRSA is a significant issue globally, the market for treating Gram-negative bacteria is smaller and slightly more unexpected, due to the quick spread of resistance [98].", "The process of discovering novel antibiotics and turning them into medicines is time- and money-consuming. A new drug must be developed, costing between USD 800 million and USD 1 billion, and it often takes more than ten years for it to reach the laboratory [99]. Examining alternatives to antibiotic therapy is a new strategy, given the urgency with which we must now combat antibiotic resistance.

Researchers are actively seeking new treatment options to combat these resilient pathogens. One notable example is Teixobactin, a groundbreaking antibiotic discovered in 2015. Teixobactin effectively targets a wide range of drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria [135]. Unlike some traditional antibiotics, Teixobactin\u2019s mechanism of action, which disrupts bacterial cell walls, makes it less likely to trigger resistance [136]. Another innovative antibiotic, Lefamulin, is a pleuromutilin that received FDA approval in 2019 [137]. Lefamulin is used to treat community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, including infections caused by drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis (binding to the peptidyl transferase center of the 50S bacterial ribosome, thus preventing the binding of transfer RNA for peptide transfer), providing an alternative treatment for cases where resistance to older antibiotics has emerged [138,139]. Zoliflodacin is being studied as a novel antibiotic for drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacteria responsible for gonorrhea [140]. This antibiotic, which falls into the spiroketone class, targets DNA replication, making it a promising option for combating a sexually transmitted infection that has developed resistance to multiple drugs [141].

Engineered lysins have shown promise in targeting specific bacterial species or strains, including antibiotic-resistant ones. Lysins can be effective against a wide range of bacteria and can be developed relatively quickly. Lysins offer a potentially rapid response to bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic-resistant strains [145].

This approach involves administering two or more antibiotics with distinct mechanisms of action simultaneously. By targeting different aspects of bacterial physiology, combination therapy can reduce the selective pressure that drives resistance development. Two notable examples of combination therapies are Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations [115,116]. The TMP-SMX combination therapy pairs Trimethoprim, which inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, with Sulfamethoxazole (an inhibitor of dihydropteroate synthase). Together, these drugs disrupt two essential steps in the bacterial folate synthesis pathway. TMP-SMX is highly effective against a broad range of bacterial infections, including urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, and opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients [146]. This combination is particularly valuable in treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [147]. The Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations are those in which a beta-lactam antibiotic (such as ampicillin, piperacillin, or cefotaxime) is paired with a beta-lactamase inhibitor (like sulbactam, clavulanic acid, or tazobactam). The inhibitor prevents the enzymatic degradation of the beta-lactam antibiotic, allowing it to remain effective against a broader spectrum of bacteria, including those with beta-lactamase enzymes. Examples of such combination therapies include ampicillin/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, which are used to combat various bacterial infections, especially those caused by beta-lactamase-producing organisms [148,149].", "Combination therapies: The use of multiple antibiotics in combination is a promising strategy to enhance treatment efficacy and prevent the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.

The rise of drug-resistant bacteria has underscored the importance of fortifying the body\u2019s natural defenses to complement antibiotic therapies and, in some cases, reduce the need for antibiotics. Several approaches have been explored to harness the immune system\u2019s capabilities effectively. One of the strategies employed is the use of immunomodulatory compounds. These include cytokines such as interferons (e.g., interferon-gamma), interleukins, and colony-stimulating factors. Interferon-gamma, for instance, plays a pivotal role in activating macrophages, which are key components of the immune system. IFN-\u03b3 therapy has been utilized in treating infections like tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections [150]. By bolstering the immune response, these compounds help the body combat bacterial invaders more effectively. Vaccination is another proactive approach to stimulate the immune system. The development of vaccines targeting specific bacterial pathogens has yielded remarkable results. For instance, vaccines against drug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae have significantly reduced the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pneumonia [151]. Vaccination not only provides direct protection, but also curbs the spread of drug-resistant bacteria within communities. Immunostimulants, including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), can be used to enhance white blood cell production [152]. This heightened immune response can assist the body in fighting off infections more effectively. While not a direct substitute for antibiotics, immunostimulants can be employed to reduce the reliance on antibiotics and support the immune system\u2019s efforts [153].", "Immune modulation: Immune modulation is a strategy of boosting the immune response to enhance the clearance of bacterial infection and represents a critical strategy in addressing antibiotic resistance.

Various strategies have been employed to harness the potential of these antibodies, with promising results. One notable example is the development of mAbs targeting Clostridium difficile, a bacterium responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis [155]. Bezlotoxumab, a monoclonal antibody, has been approved for the prevention of recurrent C. difficile infection. Bezlotoxumab works by binding to the C. difficile toxin B, preventing its harmful effects and reducing the risk of recurrent infections in high-risk patients [156]. This approach not only provides a targeted therapy, but also reduces the reliance on antibiotics, which can exacerbate C. difficile infections. Another groundbreaking development is the creation of mAbs targeting Staphylococcus aureus. In particular, the antibody-derived molecule called Altastaph is designed to bind to the bacteria\u2019s surface protein, effectively neutralizing the pathogen. This approach is particularly relevant in combating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, which are notorious for their resistance to multiple antibiotics [157]. By utilizing Altastaph and similar antibodies, researchers aim to enhance the immune system\u2019s ability to recognize and clear MRSA infections.

This can lead to cell lysis and the inactivation of microorganisms. Some nanoparticles, such as silver nanoparticles, release ions that interfere with microbial DNA replication and protein synthesis [160,161]. Additionally, certain nanoparticles can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to light. These ROS, including singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals, have potent antimicrobial properties which damage microbial components [162]. Nanoparticles can also inhibit biofilm formation, a crucial virulence factor in many pathogens. They achieve this by disrupting quorum sensing, preventing initial attachment, or destabilizing the biofilm matrix [163]. Moreover, nanoparticles can be designed for drug delivery, allowing the encapsulation and targeted release of antimicrobial agents directly at the infection site. This enhances drug stability and bioavailability, and minimizes systemic side effects, making them a valuable tool in antimicrobial therapy [164]. The advantages of nanoparticles as antimicrobials are manifold. They exhibit broad-spectrum activity against various microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Here, we delve into the economic aspects of antibiotic resistance:(i)Increased Healthcare Costs: One of the most immediate economic consequences of antibiotic resistance is the rise in healthcare costs [215]. Resistant infections often require more extended hospital stays, complex treatments, and costly second-line antibiotics. Further, the increased financial burden on healthcare systems can limit resources available for other critical health services.(ii)Lost Productivity: Antibiotic-resistant infections can lead to extended sick leave, decreased productivity, and even disability or death, resulting in economic losses [216]. When individuals are unable to work or need prolonged medical care due to antibiotic-resistant infections, it affects not only their personal income but also overall workforce productivity.(iii)Antibiotic Research and Development Costs: Developing new antibiotics is a costly and time-consuming process.

The financial implications of treating patients with resistant infections are multifaceted and extend across different aspects of healthcare delivery. Longer hospital stays, specialized treatments, and increased diagnostic expenses contribute to the rising healthcare costs [221]. Patients with resistant infections often require extended care, as the treatment becomes more challenging due to limited antibiotic options. This leads to an increase in hospitalization costs, a heavier demand for resources, and the need for additional staff to manage the complex cases. Furthermore, advanced laboratory testing and diagnostics are crucial for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of resistant infections, which adds to the financial burden. Identifying the resistance profile of the infecting pathogen is essential for guiding treatment decisions. The costs associated with laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures can be substantial. Infection control measures are another significant contributor to healthcare costs. To prevent the spread of resistant infections within healthcare facilities, stringent infection control practices are necessary. These practices include isolating infected patients, implementing thorough hygiene protocols, and dedicating additional resources to maintaining a clean and safe environment [198]. The financial investment required to establish and maintain these measures places additional pressure on healthcare budgets. The allocation of resources, such as personnel, bed capacity, and equipment, also needs to be adjusted to accommodate patients with resistant infections.

Addressing these challenges is essential for enhancing the quality and accuracy of data, which can, in turn, lead to improved strategies in the battle against antibiotic resistance. Several key challenges include:(i)Under-reporting: One of the most substantial issues in surveillance systems is under-reporting. Healthcare providers and facilities may fail to report antibiotic-resistant cases due to concerns about potential consequences or the administrative burden of reporting [235]. This leads to an incomplete and inaccurate representation of the true prevalence of antibiotic resistance, hindering the ability to implement targeted interventions.(ii)Variability in Data Quality: Data on antibiotic-resistant cases can vary significantly in quality. Variations in laboratory testing methods, diagnostic capabilities, and reporting mechanisms can lead to inconsistencies in data [236]. For instance, different facilities may use diverse criteria for defining antibiotic resistance, making it difficult to compare data across regions or healthcare systems.(iii)Limited Access to Comprehensive Data: Access to comprehensive data is often limited, due to issues related to data sharing and privacy. Sharing patient-specific data while maintaining privacy is a delicate balance that can be challenging to achieve [237]. As a result, surveillance systems might not have access to complete patient histories, hindering the ability to track the progression of antibiotic resistance.(iv)Heterogeneous Reporting Standards: Reporting standards and guidelines can vary significantly from one region to another. This heterogeneity can create confusion and challenges in data interpretation and integration [238].

Geographical Perspective of Antibiotic Resistance", "22. Geographical Perspective of Antibiotic Resistance", "Variations in antibiotic resistance patterns and the effectiveness of interventions are critical aspects of the complex global issue of antibiotic resistance. These variations occur due to a multitude of factors, including geographical location, healthcare practices, socio-economic conditions, and the implementation of intervention strategies [248]. By examining antibiotic resistance trends in specific regions or countries, the manuscript could shed light on the diverse challenges and successes faced by different healthcare systems. Geographical variation is one of the most apparent factors influencing resistance patterns. Different regions or countries can have varying resistance profiles due to variations in antibiotic usage, healthcare infrastructure, and the presence of local strains of resistant bacteria. For example, certain regions may have higher rates of antibiotic resistance due to widespread overuse or misuse of antibiotics, while others may have more stringent antibiotic stewardship programs in place. The effectiveness of interventions also varies by location. In some regions, aggressive antibiotic stewardship programs and infection control measures have led to notable reductions in antibiotic resistance. For instance, a study in Country A might show that a comprehensive stewardship program has successfully reduced the prevalence of resistant bacteria in healthcare settings. The success of interventions can be hindered by several challenges. In regions with limited resources or access to healthcare, implementing effective interventions can be a significant challenge. Even when interventions are available, compliance and adherence to guidelines by healthcare providers and patients may vary, impacting their effectiveness. Variations in local policies and healthcare practices also contribute to resistance patterns. Regions with strict regulations on antibiotic use in agriculture and aquaculture may have lower rates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria transmitted through the food chain [249]. Similarly, healthcare systems that prioritize antibiotic stewardship and infection control measures tend to have better resistance outcomes. Socio-economic factors play a significant role. Regions with high levels of poverty may face challenges in accessing healthcare and may be more prone to self-medication with antibiotics. Socio-economic status can influence the availability of healthcare resources and education on antibiotic use. Regions with well-implemented public awareness campaigns tend to see greater patient and public engagement in responsible antibiotic use.
