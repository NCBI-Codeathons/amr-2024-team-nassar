Automated tools to connect genomic and structural information with resistance determinants of known antibiotics will further support resistance-based mining efforts40,46\u201348.", "One strategy to specifically search for antibiotic natural products is to mine microbial genomes for resistance genes (Fig.\u00a01). Bacteria have evolved several strategies to avoid the self-toxicity of their antibiotics, including enzyme-catalyzed antibiotic modifications, bypass of antibiotic targets, and active efflux of drugs from the cell41. The required resistance genes are often co-localized with the genes encoding the biosynthetic machinery for antibiotic production and can thus serve as a guide to discover putative antibiotics42. Mining the genomes of 86 Salinispora strains for putative target-modifying resistance genes associated with natural product biosynthetic genes led to the prioritization of an orphan PKS-NRPS hybrid gene cluster harboring a putative fatty acid synthase resistance gene as a candidate for targeted antibiotic discovery. Heterologous expression of the gene cluster in a Streptomyces host led to the identification of a group of thiotetronic acid natural products, including the previously known fatty acid synthase inhibitor thiolactomycin (6)43. Even though the chemical structure of this compound had been long known, this work revealed the molecular basis of thiolactomycin biosynthesis for the first time and demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach. Guided by the presence of genes coding for pentapeptide repeat proteins known for conferring resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors, in the genome of the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax, a cryptic PKS gene cluster was targeted. Its activation in the native host as well as its heterologous expression enabled the structure elucidation of pyxidicyclines (e.g., pyxidicyclin A, 7)44. A similar strategy was successfully applied for the targeted discovery of a novel bioactive compound from filamentous fungi. With the aim to discovering a potential herbicide, published fungal genomes were scanned for genes coding for dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) that are co-localized with core biosynthetic enzymes. DHAD is an essential enzyme in the indispensable branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway in plants and a common target for herbicides. A homolog of a DHAD encoding gene was identified in the vicinity to genes encoding a sesquiterpene cyclase homolog and two cytochrome P450s in Aspergillus terreus. Since this set of genes was highly conserved among a number of fungal genomes, it was hypothesized that it might code for a natural product with DHAD inhibitory activity. Heterologous expression of this gene cluster in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and subsequent compound isolation and characterization revealed aspterric acid (8) as the encoded natural product and confirmed its DHAD inhibitory activity45. These examples demonstrate that genes conferring self-resistance can serve as an indicator of biosynthetic machinery encoding putative antibiotics or toxins.

Single-cell-based technologies will open additional possibilities to study biosynthetic capabilities of individual members of microbiomes.", "Peer review information\nNature Communications thanks Hosein Mohimani, Tilmann Weber and the other anonymous reviewer(s) for their contribution to the peer review of this work.", "Publisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "Acknowledgements", "The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of their original work by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)\u2014Project-ID 239748522\u2014SFB 1127 ChemBioSys, Cluster of Excellence, Balance of the Microverse, and Leibniz Award.", "Author contributions", "K.S. and C.H. developed the concept for the review and drafted and edited the manuscript.", "Data availability", "Data sharing not applicable as no original research is reported.", "Competing interests", "The authors declare no competing interests.", "References"]
