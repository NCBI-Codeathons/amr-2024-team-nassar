Here we report for the first time the complete genome of Y. ruckeri (Yersinia ruckeri) SC09, a highly virulent strain isolated from Ictalurus punctatus with severe septicemia. SC09 possesses a single chromosome of 3,923,491 base pairs, which contains 3651 predicted protein coding sequences (CDS), 19 rRNA genes, and 79 tRNA genes. Among the CDS, we have identified a Ysa locus containing genes encoding all the components of a type III secretion system (T3SS). Comparative analysis suggest that SC09-Ysa share extensive similarity in sequence, gene content, and gene arrangement with Salmonella enterica pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) and chromosome-encoded T3SS from Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1B. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis shown that SC09-Ysa and SPI1-T3SS belong on the same branch of the phylogenetic tree. These results suggest that SC09-Ysa and SPI1-T3SS appear to mediate biological function to adapt to specific hosts with a similar niche, and both of them are likely to facilitate the development of an intracellular niche. In addition, our analysis also indicated that a substantial part of the SC09 genome might contribute to adaption in the intestinal microenvironment, including a number of proteins associated with aerobic or anaerobic respiration, signal transduction, and various stress reactions. Genomic analysis of the bacterium offered insights into the pathogenic mechanism associated with intracellular infection and intestinal survivability, which constitutes an important first step in understanding the pathogenesis of Y. ruckeri.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Yersinia ruckeri, a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium, is the etiological agent for enteric red mouth disease (ERM) in various fish species, resulting in severe economic losses in aquaculture [1]. The organism was isolated from salmonid fish with ERM in the United States as early as the 1950s [2]. Subsequently, in the late 1970s to the 1980s, it was introduced to Europe from the USA [3,4,5,6]. Since then, the hosts and geographic distribution of this pathogen has increased. Now, it has been isolated in many countries around the world and spread throughout North and South America, Europe, Australia, South Africa, the Middle East, and China, ranging from different hosts such as rainbow trout, carp, catfish, sturgeon, burbot, and perch [1,2]. Vaccination is the most effective method of combating disease and the first commercially available fish vaccine was an immersion vaccine against ERM [7]. Often vaccination by injection is the most effective means of disease prevention in aquaculture. However, this method is stressful for the fish and labor intensive for the farmer. So, novel oral and immersion delivery methods have captured the attention of researchers and aquarists and some corresponding fish vaccines have been developed [8]. Despite the general administration of a quite effective immersion vaccine in salmonid fish, outbreaks still occur, produced mainly by certain isolates [9,10,11]. These nonmotile isolates were different from previous strains, and they were classified as Y. ruckeri biotype 2 [12,13]. Recently, it is one of the most important infectious diseases in Ictalurus punctatus aquaculture in China [14].", "Yersinia ruckeri, a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium, is the etiological agent for enteric red mouth disease (ERM) in various fish species, resulting in severe economic losses in aquaculture [1].

Pathological changes in diseased Ictalurus punctatus shows general septicemia with inflammation in most organs, including the kidney, spleen, liver, and gastrointestinal tract (Figure 1). The pathogenic mechanisms of Y. ruckeri may be associated with its characterization of intracellular infection and intestinal infection. In the process of infection, the organism may invade the gill epithelium and gastrointestinal tract epithelium in the early phase and then enter the blood circulatory system in the later phase, after which it could further infect the spleen and trunk kidney, and accumulate in the lymphoid organs, finally breaking down the immune system [15]. Studies have also shown that Y. ruckeri is a facultative intracellular pathogen; it could survive inside macrophages in vitro as well as in vivo and the number of bacteria inside macrophages steadily increased after immersion infection [16]. The molecular basis of intracellular survival and extracellular intestinal survival on Y. ruckeri are still unclear, although both contribute to pathogenicity in fish. In fact, studies into the pathogenic characterization of Y. ruckeri are still limited presently, as most researchers\u2019 efforts have focused on individual virulence factors, such as extracellular toxins, high affinity iron uptake system, and resistance to innate immune mechanisms [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25]; systemic research is lacking.

These toxins can modulate various cellular functions that are of benefit to the pathogen [31]. The type III secretion system (T3SS) belongs to these protein-delivery machines. T3SSs, as macromolecular nanomachines, are widespread in many Gram-negative bacteria, which involve over 20 different proteins [31]. Among different bacterial species, the overall architecture of T3SSs is similar, but T3SS-encoding operons and the genes encoding for individual components often present a different organizational profile, with the most notable distinctions being identified for genes involved in the regulatory cascade [32].

Structural organization of the nanomachines is involved in the base, needle, inner membrane export apparatus, cytosolic components, needle tip, and translocon [39]. In SC09-T3SS, the invG, prgH, and prgK (NJ56_03800, NJ56_03790, and NJ56_03775, respectively) encodes the base, which is composed of two rings associated with the inner membrane (encoded by prgH and prgK) and an outer membrane (encoded by invG). Tertiary structure prediction of these three protein-encoding genes indicated that they all share a small domain with an \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 configuration (Figure S5); such a domain may be responsible for ring formation [40]. prgI (NJ56_03785) and prgJ (NJ56_03780) are predicted to encode the needle substructure, assembled from multiple copies of a single residue subunit, and in silico modeling has shown that these two proteins share a similar \u03b1-helical hairpin shape flanked by flexible regions (Figure S5). Inner membrane export apparatus are encoded by invA (NJ56_03810), spaP (NJ56_03840), spaQ (NJ56_03845), spaR (NJ56_03850), and spaS (NJ56_03855), which were predicted as channels to transport effectors through the inner membrane [30]. There are several cytosolic proteins that are also essential for the initial secretion of the effectors and they are conserved compared with other components across all T3SSs: an ATPase (InvC), a stalk that links the ATPase to the plasma membrane (InvI), a ring-like component that may act as a sorting platform for ATPase (SpaO), a stator that can recruit the ATPase to the ring-like component (OrgB), and an additional accessory protein (OrgA) [38]; they are respectively encoded by invC, invI, spaO, orgB, and orgA (NJ56_03820, NJ56_03825, NJ56_03835, NJ56_03765, and NJ56_03770) in SC09-Ysa, of which the ATPase could unfold some effector proteins in vitro, and therefore may play an equivalent role in vivo [41]. The needle filament is capped at its tip by a single protein [42] and the tip protein is encoded by sipD (NJ56_03875) in SC09. The SipD presents a distinct domain organization: an \u03b1-helical hairpin located in the N-terminal, a mixed structural elements in the C-terminal region, and a coiled-coil domain located in the central part (Figure S5). This protein is not only responsible for forming the needle tip, but is also thought to provide a platform for the formation of a pore on the host cell membrane [43]. The pore is composed of two interacting translocator proteins [30], SipB and SipC, encoded by sipB and sipC (NJ56_03865 and NJ56_03870). T3SS-mediated delivery of effector proteins into eukaryotic cells is mediated by the SipB and SipC [30]. Although the translocases are not well conserved at the primary amino acid sequence level (Figure 4), both of them have the \u03b1-helical domain with transmembrane helices (Figure S5). In addition, InvB, SicA, SipA, and SicP are type III secretion-associated molecular chaperones for various effector proteins [35] and they are encoded by invB, sicA, sipA, and sicP, respectively (NJ56_03815, NJ56_03860, NJ56_03880, and NJ56_03890). InvJ (encoded by invJ, NJ56_03830) is responsible for proper needle complex assembly. In the absence of invJ, assembly of the inner rod does not take place [44]. An effector protein, SptP (encoded by sptp, NJ56_03895), was identified and contains a tyrosine domain. Once the bacteria are internalized, the SptP can mediate the recovery of the integrity of a host cell membrane by reconstructing the cytoskeleton [45].

In addition, InvB, SicA, SipA, and SicP are type III secretion-associated molecular chaperones for various effector proteins [35] and they are encoded by invB, sicA, sipA, and sicP, respectively (NJ56_03815, NJ56_03860, NJ56_03880, and NJ56_03890). InvJ (encoded by invJ, NJ56_03830) is responsible for proper needle complex assembly. In the absence of invJ, assembly of the inner rod does not take place [44]. An effector protein, SptP (encoded by sptp, NJ56_03895), was identified and contains a tyrosine domain. Once the bacteria are internalized, the SptP can mediate the recovery of the integrity of a host cell membrane by reconstructing the cytoskeleton [45]. Another positive transcriptional activator, InvF (encoded by invF, NJ56_03795), belonging to the AraC family (blue, Figure 3), is involved in a regulatory pathway that leads to the activation of the inv-spa-sic-sip-iac-sic-spt operon [46]. hpt, hp, hk, and 03750 (NJ56_03735-NJ56_03750) are comprised of a two-component signal transduction system (blue, Figure 3), which may be the central regulator in the overall scheme of SC09-T3SS regulation and activate expression of the prg/org, and inv/spa operons.", "SC09 also encodes (NJ56_03910\u2013NJ56_03975) a general secretion pathway (GSP)\u2013like system that is known as type II secretion system (T2SS).

Identified transporters are listed in Figure 8, including three types of solute transporting ATPases (P-type, F-type, and ABC-type), major facilitator superfamily (MFS) proteins, ion efflux and pump, siderophore-TonB system, multidrug efflux pump, and various secretion systems (Tat, Sec, T1SS, T2SS, T3SS, T4SS). The P-type ATPases constitute a large protein family that pumps ions and lipids across cellular membranes [60]. Of this type of ATPase, NJ56_05525-NJ56_05535 is predicted to encode a K+-transporting ATPase, NJ56_02935 is predicted to encode a cation-transporting ATPase, NJ56_00935 and NJ56_04920 encode P-type ATPases conferring resistance to some toxic metals such as cadmium and copper, and NJ56_12005 is responsible for Mg2+-importing. F-type ATPase can use an electrochemical gradient of H+ to synthesize ATP [61], which is encoded by NJ56_13835-NJ56_13870 in the genome. Compared to F-type and P-type ATPases, ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters are most abundant in SC09. ABC transporters, located in the integral membrane, can actively transport a variety of substrates across the bacterial membranes [62]. In fact, this transporter exhibits specificity to a broad range of substrates in different bacteria: carbohydrates, amino acids, inorganic ions, multidrug, oligopeptides, and osmoprotectants [63]. ABC transporters from SC09 genome enable the bacteria to uptake a variety of amino acids (histidine, glutamine, arginine, glutamate/aspartate, cystine, branched-chain amino acid, d-methionine, glycine betaine/proline,), peptides, vitamin B12, ribose, heme, hemin, thiamine, and inorganic ions, and to exude toxic compounds and antibiotics. Similarly, MFS is also one of the largest groups of transporters in bacteria [64]. MFS transporters in SC09 target a wide spectrum of substrates including enterobactin, hexuronate, xanthine/uracil carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids and peptides, nucleosides, antibiotics, and other unknown molecules.
