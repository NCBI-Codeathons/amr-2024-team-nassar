["Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.", "Lung cancer, a malignant tumor with the highest death rate of cancer, seriously endangers human health. And its pathogenesis and mechanism of drug resistance has been partially clarified, especially for the signal pathway of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The targeting therapy of EGFR signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has achieved a certain effect, but the two mutation of EGFR and other mechanisms of lung cancer resistance still greatly reduce the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy on it. MicroRNA is an endogenous non coding RNA, which has a regulatory function after transcriptional level. Recent studies on the mechanism of lung cancer resistance have found that a variety of microRNAs are related to the mechanism of lung cancer drug-resistance. They can regulate lung cancer resistance by participating in signal pathways, drug resistance genes and cell apoptosis, thus affecting the sensitivity of cancer cells to drugs. Therefore, microRNAs can be used as a specific target for the treatment of lung cancer and plays a vital role in the early diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of lung cancer. This article reviews the mechanisms of lung cancer resistance and its relationship with microRNAs.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "In recent decades, lung cancer has become the most common malignant disease with the highest incidence and mortality rate in China and even the whole world, which poses a serious threat to human health.

This gene is essential for normal development of the cardiovascular system and aids in rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Another one, APC gene is involved in Wnt signal pathway, which is related to the origin of cancer in humans. All of the above provide new perspectives for the study of drug resistance of lung cancer.

As stated above miRNAs overexpressed in lung cells (or drug-resistance lung cells), such as miR-374a, miR-92a, miR-106a, act as oncogenes that promote the development of lung cancer cells and increase drug resistance by negatively regulating tumor suppressor genes and/or genes that control cellular processes such as EMT and apoptosis. Other miRNAs do the opposite function when they are overexpressed in the lung cells, such as miR-548b, miR-200a, and miR-432. And there are some miRNAs such as miR-34a can form a negative feedback closed- loop with the expression of the related gene Axl. And miR-34a and Axl are reciprocally linked in a feedback loop to regulate each other in the lung cancer cells, which can affect drug resistance of lung cancer cells.", "In the lung cancer, miRNAs perform dual regulatory function: they act as oncogenes to promote cancer development or as tumor suppressors to inhibit this process 84.

The capacity of a single miRNA to regulate the expression of multiple genes simultaneously presents an opportunity to use these small molecules in personalized therapy as individualized therapeutic tools. MiRNAs may not only be used as markers of the response to cisplatin but also as potential treatment tools that stimulate the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to this chemotherapeutic agent 84. And they also have a very important guiding significance in avoiding and reversing lung cancer resistance effectively in the future. It is hoped that the miRNAs based targeting therapy can be applied in the future with more and more in-depth study of lung cancer cells and their drug resistance mechanism.
