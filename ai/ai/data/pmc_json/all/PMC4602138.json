To decipher the role of the genes adjacent to the structural genes cesA/cesB, coding for the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), gene inactivation- and overexpression mutants of the emetic strain F4810/72 were constructed and their impact on cereulide biosynthesis was assessed. The hydrolase CesH turned out to be a part of the complex regulatory network controlling cereulide synthesis on a transcriptional level, while the ABC transporter CesCD was found to be essential for post-translational control of cereulide synthesis. Using a gene inactivation approach, we show that the NRPS activating function of the phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPtase) embedded in the ces locus was complemented by a chromosomally encoded Sfp-like PPtase, representing an interesting example for the functional interaction between a plasmid encoded NRPS and a chromosomally encoded activation enzyme. In summary, our results highlight the complexity of cereulide biosynthesis and reveal multiple levels of toxin formation control. ces operon internal genes were shown to play a pivotal role by acting at different levels of toxin production, thus complementing the action of the chromosomal key transcriptional regulators AbrB and CodY.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The cyclic dodecadepsipeptide cereulide, a heat-, acid-, and proteolytically stable toxin, is responsible for the emetic type of food borne illness caused by a specific subgroup of Bacillus cereus. Intoxication with cereulide, which is preformed during vegetative growth of B. cereus in foods, causes nausea and heavy vomiting around 0.5\u20136 h after consumption of contaminated food (Ehling-Schulz et al., 2004). These symptoms are presumably induced by the interaction of cereulide with 5-HT3 serotonin receptors leading to the stimulation of the afferent vagus nerve (Agata et al., 1995). Usually, these symptoms decline after 24 h, but more severe foodborne intoxications requiring hospitalization or even including fatalities are reported increasingly (Dierick et al., 2005; Naranjo et al., 2011; Messelh\u00e4usser et al., 2014; Tschiedel et al., 2015).", "The cyclic dodecadepsipeptide cereulide, a heat-, acid-, and proteolytically stable toxin, is responsible for the emetic type of food borne illness caused by a specific subgroup of Bacillus cereus.

NRPSs are large multifunctional enzyme complexes consisting of repetitive modules which selectively incorporate amino acid, \u03b1-hydroxy acid or carboxylic acid monomers in the peptide product (Marahiel et al., 1997). The order of the modules usually corresponds directly to that of the monomers in the assembled peptide chain, although strict co-linearity is not always reinforced in nature (Wenzel and M\u00fcller, 2005; Lane and Moore, 2011). Very recently we could show that the enzymatic activity of the Ces-NRPS does not follow the canonical NRPS biosynthesis logic, but represents a novel mechanism of non-ribosomal peptide assembly, by using dipeptides rather than monomers as basic units (Marxen et al., 2015a,b).", "In agreement with its chemical structure [D-O-Leu-D-Ala-L-O-Val-L-Val]3, cereulide is produced enzymatically by the non-ribosomal cereulide peptide synthetase Ces (Ces-NRPS; Ehling-Schulz et al., 2005b).

Cereulide quantification via stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) was performed using a Xevo TQ-S Acquity i-class UPLC-MS/MS system and an UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm \u00d7 50 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm; Waters, UK and USA). One microliter aliquots of ethanolic extracts (of B. cereus samples) were injected directly into the UPLC/MS-MS system. Operated with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at a temperature of 50\u00b0C, the following gradient was used for chromatography: starting with a mixture (90/10, v/v) of methanol and 10 mM ammonium formate (0.1% formic acid), the methanol content was increased to 100% within 0.5 min, kept constant for 0.3 min and decreased within 0.1 min to 90%. Measurements were performed using electrospray with positive ionization and the quantitative calibration mode consisting of the following ion source parameters: capillary voltage +3.5 kV, sampling cone 30 V, source offset 30 V, source temperature 150\u00b0C, desolvation temperature 600\u00b0C, cone gas 150 L/h, desolvation gas 1000 L/h, collision gas flow 0.15 ml/min and nebuliser gas flow 6.5 bar. Calibration of the TQ-S in the range from m/z 40-1963 was performed using a solution of phosphoric acid (0.1% in acetonitrile). The UPLC and Xevo TQ-S systems were operated with MassLnyxTM 4.1 SCN 813 software, data processing and analysis were performed using TargetLynx. By means of the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, the ammonium adducts of cereulide (qualifier: m/z 1170.7\u2192172.2; 1170.7\u2192314.2; quantifier: m/z 1170.7\u2192357.2) and 13C6-cereulide (m/z 1176.7\u2192173.2; 1176.7\u2192316.3; 1176.7\u2192358.3) were analyzed using the mass transitions (given in brackets) monitored for a duration of 25 ms. ESI+ mass and product ion spectra were acquired with direct flow infusion using IntelliStart. The MS/MS parameters were tuned for each individual compound, detecting the fragmentation of the [M+NH4]+ molecular ions into specific product ions after collision with argon. For quantitation, 10 ethanolic standard solutions of the analyte cereulide (0.05\u201310.0 ng/ml) and the internal standard 13C6-cereulide (1 ng/ml) were mixed and analyzed in triplicates by means of UPLC\u2013MS/MS using the MRM mode.
