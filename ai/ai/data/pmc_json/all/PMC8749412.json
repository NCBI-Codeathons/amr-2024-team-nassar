A direct link has been established between antimicrobial self-resistance determinants of antibiotic producers, environmental bacteria, and clinical pathogens. Natural odilorhabdins (ODLs) constitute a new family of 10-mer linear cationic peptide antibiotics inhibiting bacterial translation by binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome. These bioactive secondary metabolites are produced by entomopathogenic bacterial symbiont Xenorhabdus (Morganellaceae), vectored by the soil-dwelling nematodes. ODL-producing Xenorhabdus nematophila symbionts have mechanisms of self-protection. In this study, we cloned the 44.5-kb odl biosynthetic gene cluster (odl-BGC) of the symbiont by recombineering and showed that the N-acetyltransferase-encoding gene, oatA, is responsible for ODL resistance. In vitro acetylation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses showed that OatA targeted the side chain amino group of ODL rare amino acids, leading to a loss of translation inhibition and antibacterial properties. Functional, genomic, and phylogenetic analyses of oatA revealed an exclusive cis-link to the odilorhabdin BGC, found only in X. nematophila and a specific phylogenetic clade of Photorhabdus. This work highlights the coevolution of antibiotic production and self-resistance as ancient features of this unique tripartite complex of host-vector-symbiont interactions without odl-BGC dissemination by lateral gene transfer.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Bioactive natural products and secondary metabolites are a major source of novel antibiotics.

Over time, a copy of the self-resistance determinant integrates into the BGC, leading to coregulated expression, often through incorporation into the same operon. It has been suggested that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of entire groups of genes plays a role in the evolution of BGCs and resistance. Over time, bacteria acquire resistance elements reflecting their current and past encounters with antibiotic producers (4). It has become clear that the environment is the source of an almost unlimited diversity of antibiotic resistance elements that are both extremely specific (e.g., inactivating enzymes) and broad (e.g., efflux systems), enabling the bacterium to counteract most antibiotics. Modification of the antibiotic target is one of the ways in which bacteria protect themselves from the lethal effects of their own antibiotics. Saccharopolyspora erythraea, which produces erythromycin, also produces an enzyme that attaches a methyl group to a specific site on the 23S rRNA, reducing the affinity of ribosomes for this antibiotic (5). Another mechanism of resistance involves modification of the antibiotic. Some aminoglycoside (AG)-producing actinomycete strains also produce enzymes that inactivate this class of antibiotics by adding phosphate, acetate, or adenylate groups (6). Brevibacillus brevis uses an N-acetyltransferase to modify the antimicrobial peptide edeine (EDE) (7).", "Bacteria carrying BGCs encoding antimicrobial agents require protective mechanisms against these compounds (3), to ensure that their production leads to the destruction of other susceptible microorganisms without causing suicide of the producing bacterium.

These two genera form tight sister groups, and their members have specific and persistent mutualistic relationships with the infective juveniles (IJs) of soil nematodes (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae, respectively). These entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) cooperate with Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus symbionts to kill a broad range of soil-dwelling insect larval hosts (9). It has been suggested that the ancestors of the symbiotic bacteria of EPNs arose due to ecological events about 375 million years ago and that they provided EPNs with the opportunity to colonize new nematode hosts (10). Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are both obligate symbionts of EPNs. Indeed, EPN-symbiotic bacteria have never been found living freely in soil, although metagenomics studies have recently detected their presence in a minority microbiota associated with the production of insect larvae (11). However, Photorhabdus has been isolated in a dozen cases of soft tissue abscesses and disseminated bacteremia in humans in the United States and Australia (12, 13). It has become evident that as long suspected, Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus are excellent sources of novel antimicrobial metabolites (14). EPN-symbiotic bacteria have a complex secondary metabolism characterized by the production of large amounts of specialized secondary metabolites, such as polyketides (PKs) and nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) (15). Many bioactive metabolites from diverse chemical classes with nematicidal, antifungal, or antibacterial activity have been reported (16). It has been suggested that the antimicrobial compounds produced by EPN-symbiotic bacteria kill foreign bacterial competitors, to protect the cadavers of the insects in which they multiply from invasion by other microbes (14). Two novel lead compounds from EPN-symbiotic bacteria are currently in pipelines for the development of novel classes of antibiotics for treating multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections (17). The first of these classes is the odilorhabdins (ODLs), NRP secondary metabolites from Xenorhabdus (18). The second corresponds to darobactin A, a natural product discovered by screening Photorhabdus symbionts directly targeting an integral outer membrane protein (19). ODLs, the first-in-class antibiotics, were discovered, as part of a program aiming to renew the therapeutic antibacterial arsenal, by screening a collection of Xenorhabdus species for antimicrobial activity (18, 20). NOSO-95A, -B, and -C, natural ODLs, were isolated from Xenorhabdus nematophila K102 (18). They are 10-mer linear cationic peptides containing six proteinogenic and four to six nonproteinogenic amino acids (Fig.\u00a01A), with promising broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (21). Efforts to develop this new antimicrobial class have been pursued: NOSO-502 is the first candidate from the ODL family to undergo preclinical development for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections (22, 23). The members of the ODL family have bactericidal action through the specific inhibition of bacterial translation resulting from their interaction with the 30S ribosomal subunit at a site not exploited by other clinically useful antibiotics. They bind to the ribosome in the vicinity of the decoding center (DC), interacting simultaneously with the nucleotides of the 16S rRNA and the anticodon loop of the incoming A-site aminoacyl-tRNA. At low concentrations, ODLs cause the misincorporation of amino acids by decreasing decoding fidelity, whereas at high concentrations, they interfere with the progression of the ribosome along the mRNA. The ability of ODLs to cause miscoding is probably responsible for their bactericidal activity (18, 24). As expected, given that ODLs contain nonproteinogenic amino acids synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), the putative BGC contains four large NRPS-encoding genes (odl1, odl2, odl3, and odl4) (18). Only a few mutant bacteria resistant to ODLs have been reported to date. For example, the His56Tyr variant of the ribosomal protein S10 confers a high degree of resistance to ODLs and has been identified in Escherichia coli (18). The S10 gene is located close to the 16S rRNA gene. A similar resistance profile was observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae strains bearing mutations affecting the CrrAB two-component system (TCS) (22, 25). CrrB mutations cause NOSO-502 resistance by upregulating the KexD efflux pump. This system is also known to decrease colistin sensitivity (25).", "The entomopathogenic bacteria from the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus were formerly assigned to the Enterobacteriaceae but have recently been reclassified as members of the Morganellaceae (8).

NOSO-95C was the first of these compounds for which total chemical synthesis was completed, and this compound was, therefore, chosen for this study. It was active against a range of clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria, with a MIC\u2009of \u22648\u2009\u03bcg/mL (Table\u00a01).

Only expression of the 2,764-bp DNA fragment containing the three genes upstream from odl1 resulted in NOSO-95C resistance in the recombinant E. coli strains, and subcloning experiments clearly showed that a single gene, \u201cc,\u201d was responsible for resistance to NOSO-95C (MIC, 512\u2009\u03bcg/mL) after isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction (Fig.\u00a02). The BLASTP genome annotation and InterPro domain identified the C protein as a Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT). We therefore named this gene oatA, for odilorhabdin acetyltransferase A. The GNAT family includes more than 100,000 enzymes present in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (33). These enzymes catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to a primary amine in diverse acceptor molecules. They are involved in multiple physiological events, including bacterial drug resistance, the regulation of transcription, toxin-antitoxin system control, detoxification, and protection against oxidative stress (34).

For monoacetylated NOSO-95C (m/z 1,307), ion fragments with m/z of 1,178 and 1,020.6 were obtained by the elimination of 129\u2009Da and 287\u2009Da, respectively, consistent with the loss of Lys1 and Lys1-acetylated Dab(\u03b2OH)2 (Table\u00a02). The fragmentation spectrum of biacetylated NOSO-95C (m/z 1,349) revealed ion fragments with m/z of 1,220.7, 1,062.6, and 904.6 obtained by the elimination of 129\u2009Da, 287\u2009Da, and 445\u2009Da, respectively, consistent with the loss of Lys1, Lys1-acetylated Dab(\u03b2OH)2, and Lys1-acetylated Dab(\u03b2OH)2-acetylated Dab(\u03b2OH)3 (Table\u00a02). The fragmentation profiles of mono- and biacetylated NOSO-95C therefore revealed structures with acetyl groups located on the amino groups of the Dab(\u03b2OH) residues. For the triacetylated NOSO-95C (m/z 1,391), a fragmentation pattern similar to that for biacetylated NOSO-95C was obtained, with the loss of 129\u2009Da, 287\u2009Da, and 445\u2009Da, indicating that Dab(\u03b2OH)2 and Dab(\u03b2OH)3 were acetylated. A difference of 258\u2009Da between m/z 1,391 and m/z 1,132.6 was assigned to the loss of Lys10 and Dbt11, with an acetyl group. Fragment ions with m/z of 1,174.6 and 687.4 were useful for determining which of these two amino acids were acetylated. These fragment ions are generated by the elimination of a nonmodified Dbt11 (88\u2009Da), making it possible to conclude that the last acetyl group is located on the primary amino group of Lys10 (Table\u00a02).", "OatA belongs to the GNAT superfamily, a group of enzymes catalyzing the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to a primary amine in diverse acceptor molecules. NOSO-95C contains eight primary amino groups (\u03b5- and \u03b1-primary amines of lysine in position 1), Dab(\u03b2OH) in positions 2 and 3, d-Orn in position 5, l-Lys in positions 8 and 10, and Dbt at the C-terminal position, all of which are possible sites of N-acetylation by OatA. The location of the acetyl groups was assessed by LC-MS/MS fragmentation analyses comparing monoacetylated, biacetylated, and triacetylated NOSO-95C with native NOSO-95C (Fig.\u00a0S5).

It would, therefore, be interesting to compare the resistance strategies developed by bacteria against AGs with those against ODLs involving the expression of GNAT enzymes. AGs are broad-spectrum bactericidal compounds used to treat severe infections. For example, streptomycin, produced by Streptomyces griseus, was the first compound of this class to be identified. AGs contain typically one aminocyclitol ring linked via a glycosidic bond to several amino-modified sugars. AGs bind to helix 44 of the 16S rRNA in the 30S ribosomal subunit, causing translational errors and the inhibition of ribosome translocation. The N-acetylation of particular amino groups in AGs prevents the formation of some of the critical H-bonds between the drug and the 16S rRNA, resulting in a loss of antibacterial activity (36). The genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes are generally carried by plasmids and transposons. It has been suggested that these enzymes originate from organisms producing aminoglycosides. In contrast, ODLs interact simultaneously with the 16S rRNA and the anticodon loop of the A-site aminoacyl-tRNA. Indeed, the \u03b1-amine of the Lys1 residue of the antibiotic forms an H-bond with the nonbridging phosphate oxygen of residue C32 in the anticodon loop of the A-site tRNA, whereas other ODL residues form multiple H-bonds with the residues of the 16S rRNA, in helices 31, 32, and 34 (18). Previous studies have shown that removal of Dab(\u03b2OH)2 or d-Orn5 from the ODL molecule strongly decreases both inhibitory capacity and the antibacterial activity of the altered compound (37). These data suggest that the amino group of the Dab(\u03b2OH)2 residue is of crucial importance for antibacterial activity. A high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the bacterial 70S ribosome in complex with an ODL analog revealed that the side chains of Dab(\u03b2OH)2 and d-Orn5 interact directly with the sugar-phosphate backbone of nucleotides C1051 and C1214 of 16S rRNA helix 34, suggesting that they are likely to be important for the inhibition of translation (18).

The Agilent oligonucleotide microarray used in this study carries two or three 60-mer probes per sequence of interest. The 40 sequences of interest were either NRPS-PKS modules or nonmodular genes associated with NRPS-PKS loci identified in the genomic sequences of X. nematophila ATCC 19061T and P. laumondii TT01T (Fig.\u00a0S7). We found that all X. nematophila strains, including the first ODL-producing strain ever described, K102, harbored the complete 44.5-kb locus carrying both the odl-BGC and the self-resistance gene, oatA. Complete odl loci, including oatA genes, were also present in P. laumondii and some Photorhabdus species (P. luminescens, P. laumondii, and P. kayaii). The oatA orthologs identified in Photorhabdus genomes flanked the odl-BGC locus (Fig.\u00a06A). In contrast, within genus Xenorhabdus, this genomic organization was conserved only in the species X. nematophila (Fig.\u00a06B). In both cases, the flanking regions of the odl-BGC locus have two remarkable features: their high content of enzyme-encoding genes, such as that encoding OatA, and their low GC content (Fig.\u00a06). These features suggest that the large modular locus involved in ODL synthesis and self-resistance to ODLs was recently constructed by the addition of genomic modules in an as-yet-unidentified ancestor, followed by horizontal transfer to some Photorhabdus and X. nematophila species. Furthermore, the orphan oatA orthologs (i.e., odl-BGC independent) present in the genomes of Xenorhabdus hominickii and Xenorhabdus species from phylogenetic clade IV are located in radically different genomic environments; for this reason, they are considered to be oatA-like genes (Fig.\u00a06B). Interestingly, the oatA-like orthologs of clade IV frequently present features of rearrangements likely to lead to pseudogenization (Fig.\u00a0S8).

The oligonucleotide probes have a mean Tm of 80.37\u00b0C (\u00b12.25\u00b0C), a mean GC of 43.33%, and no significant match elsewhere on the two bacterial genomes (less than 80% similarity over 30 nucleotides) to prevent cross-hybridization. Microarrays (8x15K) were synthesized with Agilent ink-jet technology (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Genomic DNA extraction, microarray hybridization, and microarray image analysis were done. We obtained bacterial genomic DNA for 77 strains from the DGIMI laboratory collection according to the method of Brenner et al. (2). For each genomic DNA, 0.5 \u03bcg of material was hydrolyzed with AluI and RsaI, denatured for 5 min at 95\u00b0C, and Cy3-labeled with a genomic DNA enzymatic labeling kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Labeled targets were purified with Amicon 30-kDa columns (Millipore) and displayed a specific activity of 23 to 45 pmol of Cy3/\u03bcg. The Cy3-labeled genomic DNA was hybridized with the 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray at 65\u00b0C for 24 h. The arrays were scanned with Agilent Scanner (laser constant intensity) with the following settings: Dynamic AutoFocus, PMT Cy3 100%, 20 bit-data format, pixel resolution 5 \u03bcm. Microarray image files were extracted after intra-array normalization with Feature Extraction 10.7.3 software (Agilent Technologies). The mean background signal was calculated with the negative controls and subtracted from the mean signal for each spot. ODL biosynthesis gene distribution and profile clustering were done. After normalization and background correction, a sequence was considered present in the target genome if the hybridization signal intensity exceeded 1,000 for at least one of the probes. The hybridization profiles of each strain were transformed into binary numerical values (0, gene absent; 1, gene present). The dendrogram was generated by a hierarchical analysis of the distribution patterns (presence/absence) of the ODL-targeted probes according to the unweighted pair group method arithmetic mean (UPGMA) distance method and the Gower similarity coefficient (3), with Bionumerics software version 4.5 (Applied-Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium).

EPN-symbiotic bacteria have developed a successful strategy to avoid being killed by their own antibiotic products. OatA, a GNAT encoded by the odl-BGC, confers selective resistance to ODLs by predominantly acetylating the side chain amino group of one of its rare amino acids, leading to a rapid loss of the ability to inhibit translation and the antibacterial properties of these compounds. A link has been established between antibiotic production by bacteria residing in environments not significantly affected by human antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance and was first reported by Benveniste and Davies in 1973 (44). We show here that ODL resistance genes are present only in bacterial species belonging to the same phylogenetic cluster as the producing strain, which is specific to a particular niche, soil-dwelling EPNs. In addition, no trace of oatA HGT was detected, excluding the presence of this gene in the principal bacteria pathogenic to humans. This is an important point in the development of a new antibiotic.
