["Peter Sass and Heike Br\u00f6tz-Oesterhelt share senior authorship.", "The authors declare no conflict of interest.", "ABSTRACT", "Clp proteases consist of a proteolytic, tetradecameric ClpP core and AAA+ Clp-ATPases. Streptomycetes, producers of a plethora of secondary metabolites, encode up to five different ClpP homologs, and the composition of their unusually complex Clp protease machinery has remained unsolved. Here, we report on the composition of the housekeeping Clp protease in Streptomyces, consisting of a heterotetradecameric core built of ClpP1, ClpP2, and the cognate Clp-ATPases ClpX, ClpC1, or ClpC2, all interacting with ClpP2 only. Antibiotic acyldepsipeptides (ADEP) dysregulate the Clp protease for unregulated proteolysis. We observed that ADEP binds Streptomyces ClpP1, but not ClpP2, thereby not only triggering the degradation of nonnative protein substrates but also accelerating Clp-ATPase-dependent proteolysis. The explanation is the concomitant binding of ADEP and Clp-ATPases to opposite sides of the ClpP1P2 barrel, hence revealing a third, so far unknown mechanism of ADEP action, i.e., the accelerated proteolysis of native protein substrates by the Clp protease.", "KEYWORDS", "This work is dedicated to Philippe Mazodier in memoriam of his pioneering work on Streptomyces ClpP.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Streptomycetes are known for their complex developmental life cycle as well as for the multitude of secondary metabolites they produce, including important clinically used antibiotics.

The tetradecameric ClpP core is built of two stacked heptameric rings to form the proteolytic chamber of the Clp protease, keeping the catalytic site residues (Ser97, His122, Asp171 in Escherichia coli) within the inner lumen of the barrel and away from the cytoplasm (8). Access to the proteolytic chamber is tightly regulated. To prevent undesired substrate degradation, substrate entry is only allowed via two axial pores, which are too small for protein passage. Consequently, in the absence of a cognate Clp-ATPase, ClpP lacks proteolytic activity and only degrades short peptides (9, 10). For regulated proteolysis, Clp-ATPases and associated adaptor proteins recognize natural Clp protease substrates, bind to the apical and/or distal surface of the ClpP core, and unfold and translocate the protein substrates under ATP consumption through the entrance pores into the proteolytic chamber of ClpP (11).", "The Clp protease typically consists of a barrel-shaped, tetradecameric ClpP core that associates with hexameric ATP-consuming unfoldases, so-called Clp-ATPases, for protein degradation (7).

Other pathogenic bacteria, including mycobacteria, chlamydia, listeria, clostridia, and pseudomonads, possess two ClpP isoforms, i.e., ClpP1 and ClpP2, which may form homotetradecameric complexes of either ClpP1 or ClpP2 or heterotetradecameric complexes involving both ClpP homologs (15\u201320). Streptomycetes have an even more complex Clp system and mostly encode three or five ClpP homologs. Current knowledge of the Streptomyces Clp machinery is mainly based on studies using Streptomyces lividans cells. In this species, five clpP genes are organized in two bicistronic (clpP1clpP2 and clpP3clpP4) and one monocistronic (clpP5) operon (3, 21), whose expression was shown to be tightly controlled via several negative feedback loops (22\u201325). For example, in S. lividans wild-type cells, the degradation of the transcriptional activators ClgR and PopR depends on the presence of ClpP1 and ClpP2 (Fig.\u00a01A). Here, ClgR induces the expression of ClpP1 and ClpP2, while the ClgR paralogue PopR is assumed to recruit the RNA polymerase for clpP3clpP4 transcription. As PopR was shown to be degraded by ClpP1 and ClpP2 in Streptomyces cells, PopR-mediated expression of the clpP3clpP4 operon is silenced in the presence of these two ClpP homologs (21\u201324). On the other hand, ClpP3 and ClpP4 are expressed in clpP1clpP2 deletion mutants due to the repealed degradation of PopR (21). In contrast to E. coli or B. subtilis, where the function of ClpP is not essential for survival, at least one functional copy of either clpP1clpP2 or clpP3clpP4 is essential for the viability of S. lividans (21). Thus, at least some functional redundancy seems to exist between the ClpP homologs in Streptomyces that might represent a rescue mechanism in case the function of ClpP1 and ClpP2 is disturbed or inhibited.", "Many bacterial species encode only a single ClpP homolog, thus forming homotetradecameric ClpP complexes, for instance, the model bacteria E. coli and Bacillus subtilis or pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (8, 12\u201314).

When different combinations of wild-type and hydrophobic pocket mutant proteins of ClpP1 and ClpP2 were used in in vitro degradation assays, it emerged that protein substrates were only digested in the presence of wild-type ClpP2, no matter which of the three ATPases was tested (Fig.\u00a02B to D). Mutagenesis of the ClpP2 hydrophobic pocket residues resulted in complete inhibition of substrate turnover. In contrast, the corresponding mutations in ClpP1hp did not affect protein degradation, and substrate turnover was comparable to the wild-type protein, indicating that the partner Clp-ATPases bind to the heterotetradecamer exclusively via ClpP2. Hence, our data clearly show that ClpP1 and ClpP2 of the heterotetradecameric ClpP core fulfill separate but complementary functions in the degradation process. ClpP1 confers catalytic activity to the complex, while ClpP2 is essential for the necessary interaction with the partner Clp-ATPases.", "Aside from catalytic activity, the interaction with partner Clp-ATPases, which unfold and feed protein substrates into the ClpP degradation chamber, is a prerequisite for the proteolytic activity of the Clp protease. Therefore, we also probed the interaction of ClpP1 and ClpP2 with the cognate Clp-ATPases by generating particular hydrophobic pocket mutations, which had previously been shown to abrogate Clp-ATPase binding to the ClpP core in the related M. tuberculosis (MtClpP) (33). The corresponding three conserved aromatic residues (Y74, Y76, and F96) in the crystal structure of E. coli ClpP (EcClpP) are also important for stabilizing Clp-ATPase interactions with ClpP (8), and the same positions were also shown to be involved in the binding of ADEP to E. coli and B. subtilis ClpP (34, 35). By aligning the protein sequences of S. hawaiiensis and S. lividans ClpP1 and ClpP2 with EcClpP and MtClpP1P2 (Fig.\u00a0S1D and E), we identified the corresponding amino acid positions in both Streptomyces ClpP1 and ClpP2.

We therefore set out to further investigate the effect of ADEP antibiotics on the Clp system of the producer genus and to characterize the potential deregulation of the in vitro peptidase and protease activity of S. hawaiiensis ClpP1 and ClpP2 in the presence of ADEP1. To do so, we first used the fluorogenic dipeptide Suc-Leu-Tyr-aminomethylcoumarin (Suc-LY-AMC) as a substrate in peptidase activity assays and measured the fluorescence signal that results from peptide cleavage and concomitant AMC release. Our results showed that neither ClpP1, ClpP2, nor ClpP1P2 possessed notable peptidase activity in the absence of ADEP1. However, ADEP1 clearly induced the hydrolysis of Suc-LY-AMC by either ClpP1 alone or by the mixed complex ClpP1P2 but not by ClpP2 alone (Fig.\u00a03B and C). Corroborating our results above, peptidase activity was lost in all assays when ClpP1 was replaced by the active site mutant protein ClpP1S113A, while replacing ClpP2 by ClpP2S131A had no effect on the activity of mixed complexes (Fig.\u00a03B). A similar result was observed, when Z-GGL-AMC, Ac-WLA-AMC, or Ac-Ala-hArg-2-Aoc-ACC was used as the substrate in peptidase activity assays (Fig.\u00a03D), although some peptidase activity of ClpP1P2 was notable when using Ac-WLA-AMC in the absence of ADEP1. Probing the binding site, ADEP1 failed to induce peptide hydrolysis when ClpP1 was exchanged by the hydrophobic pocket mutant protein ClpP1hp, whereas replacement of ClpP2 by ClpP2hp had no effect on substrate hydrolysis by the mixed complex (Fig.\u00a03B). These results indicate that ADEP1 interacts with ClpP1, but not with ClpP2. Thermal shift assays confirmed the binding affinity of ClpP1 toward ADEP1, demonstrated by an increase of >16\u00b0C in the melting temperature of the homotetradecamer in combination with ADEP1. In contrast, ADEP1 could not increase the melting temperature of ClpP2, hereby confirming that ClpP2 does not interact with ADEP1 (Fig.\u00a03E and Fig.\u00a0S2A). Such observed asymmetric binding was not restricted to ADEP1 but was also detected for ADEP2 and ADEP4, two synthetic derivatives previously optimized for potent anti-S. aureus activity (27). Uniformly, all tested ADEPs induced peptidase activity via binding to ClpP1 but not to ClpP2 (Fig.\u00a03B and F). Interestingly, ClpP1P2 exhibited slightly higher peptidase activity when activated by ADEP1, compared to ADEP2 and ADEP4, thereby indicating that the binding of the natural compound ADEP1 to Streptomyces ClpP1 may have been evolutionarily optimized. Mixed ClpP1P2, ClpP1P2S131A, and ClpP1P2hp exhibited superior peptidase activity in the presence of ADEP1 compared to ClpP1 alone (Fig.\u00a03B), implying a stimulation of ClpP1 catalytic activity by the interaction with ClpP2.

In addition, here, ADEP1 induced proteolysis of casein by either ClpP1 alone or by mixed ClpP1P2 but not by ClpP2, and again the mixed complex performed better than ClpP1 alone.

Immunoblotting using anti-ClpP1 or anti-6His antibodies identified those bands as ClpP1 homotetradecamers. Despite similar ClpP1 concentrations, the band of the ClpP1 homotetradecamer detected in the ADEP-ClpP1P2 sample appeared weaker on the native PAGE gel compared to the ADEP-ClpP1 sample.

(D) Cross-linking experiments. In the absence and presence of ADEP1, the addition of the cross-linker BS3 and the complex stabilizing agent sodium citrate led to the detection of ClpP1P2 heterotetradecamers via native PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting. Remarkably, larger amounts of ClpP1 homotetradecamers were only detected in the ClpP1 sample in the presence of ADEP1 and absence of ClpP2. (E) Increasing the amount of both ADEP and ClpP, while keeping their ratio constant, improved the detection of the tetradecameric protein band in the ClpP1P2 sample.

(A) ClpP1 and ClpP2 are processed when used in combination and in the presence of ClpX. Processed proteins are marked by colored asterisks (ClpP1*, blue; ClpP2*, green). Processing of ClpP1 depends on activation by Clp-ATPase binding to ClpP2 and is prevented in the hydrophobic patch mutant ClpP2hp. In contrast, ClpP2 processing solely depends on heterotetradecamer formation, but not on binding and activation by a Clp-ATPase. (B) ADEP1 induces processing of ClpP1 and accelerates processing of ClpP2. Samples were incubated in the absence or presence of ADEP1 over time.

When analyzing the hydrophobic pockets of ClpP1 and ClpP2, it became apparent that both isoforms differ in the first amino acid residue that was selected for mutation of each ClpP hydrophobic pocket (Y76 in ClpP1 and S94 in ClpP2, see above). Since tyrosine and serine obviously differ regarding their size and physicochemical properties, we hypothesized that this difference may influence the binding capability of ClpP1 versus ClpP2 for ADEP and corresponding Clp-ATPases.

Until now, the effects of ADEP on the housekeeping Clp protease of the producer genus Streptomyces have remained mostly elusive. Pioneering cell-based studies by Mazodier and colleagues (36) using the ADEP-sensitive S. lividans showed that ClpP1 is a target for ADEP1, since the deletion of the clpP1 gene conferred ADEP resistance in S. lividans. In addition, we have recently reported on the presence of a self-resistance factor in the ADEP producer S. hawaiiensis NRRL 15010, which is an accessory ClpP protein with a yet unknown mechanism (26). To obtain further insights into the role of ADEP in Streptomyces, we here investigated the effect of ADEP on the molecular function of the housekeeping Clp protease systems of S. hawaiiensis and S. lividans. Of note, the ClpP1 and ClpP2 proteins of S. hawaiiensis show very high amino acid sequence similarities to their corresponding homologs in S. lividans, thus suggesting a similar operation mode of ClpP1P2 in both species (Fig.\u00a0S1D).", "Previous studies on the mode of action of ADEP antibiotics have identified two distinct molecular mechanisms that, either together or individually, lead to bacterial killing. Intriguingly, the killing mode depends on the bacterial species and growth environment, and both mechanisms are described as follows. First, since Clp-ATPases and ADEP accommodate the same binding site on ClpP in the species studied so far, the binding of ADEP to ClpP displaces the commonly associated Clp-ATPases from the proteolytic core (19, 37\u201340). This leads to an inhibition of all physiological functions of the Clp protease in the bacterial cell, including regulated proteolysis. Second, ADEP binding induces an opening of the ClpP entrance pores and allosterically activates the catalytic centers, thereby allowing access of nonnative substrates to the ClpP degradation chamber that are efficiently degraded (19, 30, 34, 35, 38, 51, 52). The latter activation of the independent proteolytic core ClpP is the primary cause of bacterial killing in species harboring nonessential ClpP proteins, such as B. subtilis or S. aureus (27, 29, 30, 51, 53, 54). However, in an infection situation, where the Clp protease is essential for the expression of important virulence factors, inhibition of the natural functions will also attenuate a pathogen in the host environment (55, 56). In M. tuberculosis, the Clp protease is essential for viability under all conditions (48, 57), and we have previously shown that an ADEP-conferred mechanism of Clp protease inhibition leads to cell death in mycobacteria (39). Considering the essentiality of the Clp protease in Streptomyces and the comparative phylogenetic closeness to mycobacteria (21), it was thus tempting to hypothesize a mechanism of Clp protease inhibition as the basis of ADEP-dependent killing of Streptomyces. To our surprise, ADEP did not abrogate the Clp-ATPase-mediated substrate digestion. All our data consistently show that the presence of ADEP leads to an unexpected stimulation of the Streptomyces Clp protease to digest its natural substrates in a Clp-ATPase-dependent, more efficient manner, rather than leading to an inhibition of its natural functions. Furthermore, ADEP-stimulated Clp-ATPase/ClpP1P2 activity was not due to an increased ATP turnover. Hence, stimulation may be solely attributed to the ADEP effects that are exerted on the structural network of the entire ClpP1P2 complex. This may include adjustment of the active site residues in ClpP1 as well as pore opening for ClpP1 and ClpP2, as was previously described for ADEP-activated ClpP in other bacteria (15, 34, 35, 38).

The conformations all differ in the height of the ClpP barrel as well as the alignment of the catalytic triad residues (14, 59\u201363). The Clp protease core is understood to dynamically switch between these different conformations, thereby exhibiting separate steps of substrate hydrolysis and product release during processive substrate degradation (49, 64, 65). Here, degradation products might exit the degradation chamber through transient equatorial pores that emerge in the proteolytically inactive, compressed conformation rather than through the axial pores that may be blocked by the partner Clp-ATPases (62).

The simultaneous binding of ADEP to the opposite side of the proteolytic core via ClpP1 stabilizes the core in the proteolytically active, extended conformation (including the correct arrangement of the active centers for catalysis) and stimulates the proteolysis of natural Clp substrates that are fed by the Clp-ATPase via ClpP2. This process may be further accelerated by a more efficient product release through an opened pore of the ADEP-bound ClpP1 heptamer of the proteolytically active tetradecameric core. We have previously shown that ADEP-activated EcClpP degrades largely unstructured proteins like casein with reduced processivity compared to EcClpAP (37).

As PCR template, genomic DNA of S. hawaiiensis NRRL 15010 (NCBI GenBank accession number CP021978.1) was used to amplify shclpP1 (orf CEB94_14110), shclpP2 (orf CEB94_14105), shClpX (orf CEB94_14100), shclpC1 (orf CEB94_23085), shclpC2 (orf CEB94_33910), shclgR (orf CEB94_30145), and shpopR (MT943519). Since clpP2 encodes an internal XhoI restriction site, the vector pET22b*NcoI was created, in which the XhoI restriction site was exchanged for an NcoI restriction site (19). In addition, both shclpP1 and shclpP2 genes were cloned into the pETDUET-1 vector (Merck-Novagen), yielding the plasmid pETDUETshclpP1ATG2clpP2-His, in which the simultaneous expression of the clp genes is regulated by two distinct T7 promoters.

The obtained colonies were overlaid with 1\u2009mL of an X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-glucuronide) solution in water (1\u2009mg/mL) for a blue-white screen. For white colonies, loss of the vector and the respective clpP gene was further verified by colony PCR and subsequent Sanger sequencing. Multiple sequence alignments were generated with the online tool clustal\u03a9 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Sequence identities were computed using Jalview Software (80).", "ADEP sensitivity assays.", "ADEP sensitivity assays.", "ADEP sensitivity assays.", "Spore suspensions of the respective Streptomyces strains were plated on nutrient extract agar (1% glucose, 0.2% yeast extract, 0.2% Casamino Acids, and 0.1% Lab-Lemco Powder, pH 7.0).
