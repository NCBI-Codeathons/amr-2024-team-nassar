["Antibiosis has been proposed to contribute to the beneficial bacteria-mediated biocontrol against pea Aphanomyces root rot caused by the oomycete pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches. However, the antibiotics required for disease suppression remain unknown. In this study, we found that the wild type strains of Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 and Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24, but not their mutants that lack 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, strongly inhibited A. euteiches on culture plates. Purified 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol compound caused extensive hyphal branching and stunted hyphal growth of A. euteiches. Using a GFP-based transcriptional reporter assay, we found that expression of the 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol biosynthesis gene phlAPf-5 is activated by germinating pea seeds. The 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol producing Pf-5 derivative, but not its 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol non-producing mutant, reduced disease severity caused by A. euteiches on pea plants in greenhouse conditions. This is the first report that 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol produced by strains of Pseudomonas species plays an important role in the biocontrol of pea Aphanomyces root rot.", "1. Introduction", "1.

Interest in using beneficial bacteria to control A. euteiches is growing because of the unavailability of resistant pea cultivars, limited chemical management options, concerns of potential fungicide resistance by the pathogens, and the increasing requests for ecofriendly management alternatives [4,5]. Several beneficial bacteria, including strains of Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus mycoides, Rhizobium spp., Pantoea agglomerans, Lysobacter capsici, and Burkholderia cepacia, were found to inhibit the A. euteiches growth in culture media and/or reduce the disease incidence in greenhouse [6,7,8]. Results of these studies suggest that antibiosis likely contributes to the pathogen suppression and disease control. For example, the beneficial bacteria that reduced the disease severity of pea Aphanomyces root rot in growth camber biocontrol assays were also found to inhibit the A. euteiches mycelial growth on culture plates [8]. However, the antibiotic(s) required by the beneficial bacteria to inhibit the A. euteiches growth and control the disease remain(s) unknown. Considering the well-recognized and important roles of antibiotics in biocontrol [9], filling this knowledge gap will advance our understanding of the biocontrol mechanism of pea Aphanomyces root rot and improve the disease control efficacy of the antibiotic-producing beneficial bacteria.", "Aphanomyces root rot of pea (Pisum sativum), caused by the oomycete pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches, is one of the most damaging soil-borne diseases that constrain pea production worldwide [3].

This is the first report that 2,4-DAPG inhibits A. euteiches and contributes to the beneficial bacteria-mediated biocontrol of pea Aphanomyces root rot disease.", "In this study, we found that 2,4-DAPG produced by beneficial bacteria of the Pseudomonas genus plays an important role in the growth inhibition of the oomycete pathogen A. euteiches on culture plates and suppression of the pea Aphanomyces root rot disease in greenhouse.

Two beneficial bacterial strains, P. protegens Pf-5 and P. fluorescens 2P24, were used in this study to determine the role of antibiotics in the growth inhibition of A. euteiches. In addition to the 2,4-DAPG, strain 2P24 is known to produce another antibiotic hydrogen cyanide [30], and strain Pf-5 can produce at least another five antibiotics including pyoluteorin, pyrrolnitrin, orfamide A, rhizoxin, and hydrogen cyanide [40]. The important role of 2,4-DAPG in the inhibition of A. euteiches is clearly supported by the results that the Pf-5 and 2P24 mutants that lack 2,4-DAPG exhibited greatly reduced inhibition against A. euteiches compared to their wild type strains (Figure 2). The anti-oomycete activities of hydrogen cyanide, pyoluteorin, pyrrolnitrin, orfamide A, and rhizoxin have been reported previously in various phytopathogenic systems [46,47,48,49,50]. However, our results show that Pf-5 mutants that lack these five antibiotics retained strong inhibition against A. euteiches, suggesting that these five antibiotics of Pf-5 do not play a major role in the growth inhibition against A. euteiches. The important role of 2,4-DAPG in the inhibition of A. euteiches is also supported by the morphological changes in mycelia (excessive and stunted hyphal branches) of A. euteiches caused by purified 2,4-DAPG (Figure 3) and the reduced disease control efficacy of the 2,4-DAPG nonproducing mutant compared to the 2,4-DAPG producing derivative of Pf-5 (Figure 5). We recognized that the culture conditions used in the inhibition assays may not be conducive for the tested bacterial strains to produce all their antibiotics.

Using a GFP-based transcriptional reporter system, we found that expression of the 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis gene phlAPf-5 is strongly induced at both transcriptional and translational levels by germinating pea seeds (Figure 4). These results are consistent with our previous report that the 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis genes such as phlDPf-5 are highly expressed in Pf-5 on the germinating pea seeds (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) in an RNAseq analysis and that 2,4-DAPG was detected on the Pf-5-treated pea seed surfaces [40]. These data support that production of 2,4-DAPG can be activated by the exudates of germinating pea seeds. Diverse metabolites including amino acids, carbohydrates, and organic acids were detected from pea seed exudates [40]. Our current understanding of how these exudates influence the antibiotic production of beneficial bacteria remains limited. Glucose is a known carbohydrate conducive to 2,4-DAPG production of Pf-5 [27,51] and has been detected in pea seed exudate at a moderate level (81.2 g/seed) [40]. However, the roles of the other more abundant carbohydrates including sucrose (1740.3 g/seed) and galactose (845.8 g/seed) and the most abundant amino acids including glutamate (206.4 g/seed) and arginine (86.1 g/seed) in the regulation of antibiotic production by Pf-5 remain unknown. Metabolites secreted by plant pathogens can also influence the antibiotic production of the associated beneficial bacteria. For example, fusaric acid, which is produced by Fusarium spp., inhibits 2,4-DAPG production of Pf-5 [36]. In this study, we found that the expression of phlAPf-5 was not altered by the presence of A. euteiches hyphae (Figure 4). Infection of plant roots by pathogens can cause a metabolic leak that enhances antibiotic production of rhizosphere-associated beneficial microorganisms. For example, expression of phlA by the beneficial bacterium P. protegens CHA0 was increased on barley roots after infection by Pythium ultimum [55]. No or minimal damage of pea seeds were observed by the inoculated A. euteiches in our transcriptional reporter assays, probably due to the short incubation time (24 h) that was used to collect the GFP data of the bacterial reporter.

Genes phlABCD encode four enzymes (PhlABCD) in the 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis pathway (B), and their expression is negatively regulated by the transcriptional repressor PhlF; PhlG degrades 2,4-DAPG to MAPG and its expression is controlled by PhlH; phlE encodes a putative permease of 2,4-DAPG. (C), Filter paper disks containing the indicated amount of the tested compounds were dried and placed around A. euteiches on \u00bd PDA plates. Representative results from three replicates were recorded two days after inoculation. (D), the oomycete hyphae were sampled at the A. euteiches growth margin on plates of (C) and examined under a microscope immediately after the inhibition was observed.

Wild type Pf-5 containing the GFP-based transcriptional reporter constructs pphlApromoter-gfp (A), or the translational reporter construct pphlAtranslation-gfp (B) was cultured with germinating pea seeds with or without the presence of A. euteiches hyphae.
