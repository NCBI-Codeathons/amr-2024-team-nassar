Clavulanic\nacid is a multi-billion-dollar per annum product\nuseful for its \u03b2-lactamase inhibitory activity.\nWhile the biosynthesis of clavulanic acid has been\nthe subject of intense investigation in recent years,\nthe details of its production and regulation are still\nnot completely worked out.", "Amplification of the ccaR gene, a regulatory gene\nin the cephamycin gene cluster, resulted in an almost\nthreefold increase in the production of both\ncephamycin and clavulanic acid in S. clavuligerus\n(20). The formation of clavulanic acid is controlled\nby a LysR-type regulatory protein encoded by the\nclaR gene. The claR gene was then chosen because\nthis is a putative regulatory gene in the production\npathway of clavulanic acid (33). The claR gene,\nwhich is located downstream from the gene encoding\nclavaminate synthase in the clavulanic acid\nbiosynthesis gene cluster, is involved in regulation\nof the late steps in clavulanic acid biosynthesis\n(32-34).\n.

In\nthis case, only the promoter sequence of the gene\ncomes with the claR. Since the distance between the vector born promoter and the claR transcription\nstart point is not too great, the expression of\nthe cloned gene could also be started by two individual\npromoters that exist in the vector. Therefore,\nthe usage of three promoters (one native claR\ngene and two vector-born) leads to an elevated\nlevel of claR gene expression.
