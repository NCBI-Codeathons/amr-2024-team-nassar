While the other major source of sucrose, sugar cane, is grown in more tropical climates, sugar beet is largely grown in temperate regions with the northern tier states in the United States, France, Germany, and Russia being the top producers (FAOSTAT, 2019). All cultivated beets (fodder, chard, table beet, sugar beet) are regarded to be derived from wild Mediterranean sea beet (B.\u00a0vulgaris subsp. maritima) (OECD, 2001). In the late 18th century, the German chemist Andreas Marggraf showed that sucrose in both white and red beetroot was chemically identical to the prohibitively expensive tropical cane sugar (Marggraf, 1748). Marggraf's student Franz Karl Achard noticed that conical white fodder beets had high sugar content and began to grow them for sugar production (Fischer, 1989). Achard is credited with establishing the sugar beet industry in Europe by building the first processing factory in Silesia (now Poland) in 1801. Sugar beet was subsequently commercialized in the United States in 1879 (Magnuson, 1918). Continuous breeding over the last 200\u00a0years has led to an increase in sugar content from 8% to more than 18% in cultivars grown today (Dohm et al., 2014). Additionally, the discovery of male sterile cytoplasm permitted the development of hybrid varieties for yield increase (Biancardi et al., 2010).

The disease was first described on Beta\u00a0cicla in Italy by Saccardo (1876) but now has been identified across the globe wherever sugar beet is grown. CLS is most pernicious in warm, humid growing regions (Lartey et al., 2010), which make up almost one\u2010third of the total sugar beet production area in the United States (USDA\u2010NASS, 2010). The main adversity is the loss of recoverable sucrose, reaching almost 50% under uncontrolled moderate to high disease pressure (Lamey et al., 1987; Shane and Teng, 1992). Additional economic losses occur as a result of increased impurities that complicate sucrose recovery processes, leading to higher processing costs and reduced extractable sucrose (Shane and Teng, 1992). Diseased plants are also more susceptible to storage rot in winter storage piles (Smith and Ruppel, 1973). Large economic losses were seen in sugar beet crops in southern Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to severe CLS epidemics (Wolf and Verreet, 2005). In the United States, Minnesota and North Dakota suffered losses from CLS in 1998 estimated at $113 million from yield reduction and fungicide application costs (Cattanach, 1999). In these areas, with conducive environmental conditions, it is crucial to appropriately apply fungicides otherwise substantial loss of foliar photosynthetic area can occur due to CLS (Figure\u00a01a,b). The upper Midwest has seen epidemics in three out of the last four\u00a0years in large part due to fungicide\u2010resistant Cercospora\u00a0beticola populations that have resulted in several hundred million dollars in lost revenue (Mike Metzger, Minn\u2010Dak Farmers Cooperative, personal communication).

Between sugar beet growing seasons, the fungus survives primarily as desiccation\u2010resistant hyphal structures on infected plant residues within leaf substomatal cavities. These specialized overwintering structures are known as pseudostromata, or false stromata (conidia\u2010producing hyphae), because they are composed of both fungal tissue and remnants of host tissue (Eriksson, 1981). Pseudostromata can persist on plant debris for 2\u00a0years and have long been regarded as the primary inoculum sources for infection (Pool and McKay, 1916; Khan et al., 2008). However, many population studies have questioned the role of clonally reproducing primary inoculum (Groenewald et al., 2006, 2008; Knight et al., 2018, 2019).

To reproduce, melanized conidiophores form from pseudostromata to produce conidia in the spring but this may be preceded by saprophytic, vegetative growth of fungal mycelia (Pool and McKay, 1916) (Figure\u00a01c). Transmission electron microscopy has shown that bundles of 10\u201320 conidiophores (18\u201325\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter) often form on both upper and lower leaf surfaces and are produced from subepidermal or substomatal pseudostromata (Pons et al., 1985). Pseudostromata are three to six cells deep and up to eight to 10 cells wide. Conidiophores consist of one or two cells and are 10\u201325\u00a0\u03bcm long\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u20135\u00a0\u03bcm wide at the base (Figure\u00a01d). Conidia are needle\u2010shaped (2\u20133\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036\u2013107\u00a0\u03bcm) and colourless with several cross\u2010walls (Weiland and Koch, 2004). The minimum requirements for conidial development are temperatures of at least 15\u00b0C and a relative humidity of 60% or higher (Pool and McKay, 1916; Solel and Minz, 1971a). Through wind, rain, irrigation, water splash, or insect transfer, spores are disseminated and make contact with the abaxial surface of sugar beet leaves or petioles to initiate infection (Lawrence and Meredith, 1970; Khan et al., 2007). Some studies have suggested that roots may also act as primary infection sites (Vereijssen et al., 2005), although the specific requirements for root infection remain elusive (Khan et al., 2008). Germination of conidia is optimal at high relative humidity (near 100%) and at temperatures of approximately 25\u2010\u00b0C (Ruppel, 1986; Khan et al., 2009). After germination, appressoria are produced, allowing hyphae to penetrate leaf tissue through stomata and spread intercellularly with no visible leaf symptoms (Rathaiah, 1977; Steinkamp et al., 1979). As the fungus switches to its necrotrophic phase, the production of phytotoxins and degradative enzyme activity leads to the necrotizing of infected cells (Steinkamp et al., 1979). Symptoms appear as circular spots 3\u20135\u00a0mm in size and tan to grey in colour, encircled by a tan\u2010brown to red\u2010purple border (Windels et al., 1998) (Figure\u00a01e). Symptoms can develop on older leaves as quickly as 5\u00a0days after infection when there are favourable conditions of high humidity (>90%) and warm temperatures (day 27\u201332\u00b0C, night\u00a0>\u00a017\u00b0C) (Pool and McKay, 1916; Solel and Minz, 1971b). In the field, these characteristic CLS lesions are typically observed after sugar beet canopy closure (Khan et al., 2008). Pseudostromata formed within the lesions become the site for production of new conidia as early as 7\u00a0days after infection under favourable conditions (Jacobsen and Franc, 2009). Conidia are again disseminated by wind, rain splash, or insect transfer to initiate another infection cycle. Early studies show evidence for rain splash being the major factor in spore dispersal (Carlson, 1967) while studies by Khan et al. (2008) suggested that wind was the major dispersal factor for C.\u00a0beticola inoculum because higher disease severity was observed on exposed plants when compared to plants in plastic cages or with ground cover. The distance that conidia can travel whilst retaining viability has not been reported, but genetic studies have provided evidence that long\u2010range dispersal has occurred (Groenewald et al., 2008; Vaghefi et al., 2017a; Knight et al., 2018).", "C.\u00a0beticola is an ascomycete fungus only known to exist in the anamorphic (asexual) state (Crous et al., 2001; Groenewald et al., 2013).

A consistent theme in these studies has been to provide indirect evidence for sexual recombination, migration, and mutation. These findings have supported the development of hypotheses surrounding pathogen biology and movement with important implications for disease epidemiology and management.

Ratios of isolates with different mating types (MAT1\u20101 and MAT1\u20102) within populations have been location\u2010specific.

To date, 12 genes have been found to be part of the CTB biosynthetic pathway, involved in either cercosporin production or export (Figure\u00a03a). The iterative, nonreducing PKS CTB1 is essential for cercosporin production and acts as the keystone enzyme to initiate the biosynthetic process (Choquer et al., 2005; Crawford and Townsend, 2010; Newman et al., 2012). CTB1 harbours six functional domains that work together to form nor\u2010toralactone, the first intermediate in the cercosporin assembly line using one acetyl\u2010CoA and 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0malonyl\u2010CoA units as substrate (Choquer et al., 2005; Newman et al., 2012; Newman and Townsend, 2016). Next, the nor\u2010toralactone intermediate is processed to toralacatone and subsequently to cercoquinone C by CTB3, a predicted O\u2010methyltransferase FAD\u2010dependent monooxygenase (Dekkers et al., 2007; Newman and Townsend, 2016; de Jonge et al., 2018). Further processing of this intermediate may be mediated by CTB2, CTB6, and CTB11/CTB12, which are hypothesized to methylate, reduce, and dimerize the molecule, respectively (Staerkel et al., 2013; Newman and Townsend, 2016). However, the corresponding intermediates have not been directly observed but are rather logically inferred. The CTB5 and/or CTB7 gene products are hypothesized to prime the cercosporin intermediate for methylenedioxy bridge formation by CTB9 and CTB10 to yield the final cercosporin molecule (Chen et al., 2007; Newman and Townsend, 2016; Swart et al., 2017; de Jonge et al., 2018). The CTB8 gene product is a Zn(II)Cys6 zinc finger transcription factor that is not directly involved in the modification of the toxin itself but is responsible for mediation of the CTB gene cluster expression (Chen et al., 2007). Lastly, the gene cluster holds two major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transmembrane transporters, CTB4 and the cercosporin facilitator protein (CFP) (Chen et al., 2007; Choquer et al., 2007; de Jonge et al., 2018). C.\u00a0nicotianae CTB4 mutant strains displayed a reduction in cercosporin production by at least 35% while cercosporin accumulated in fungal mycelium and was not secreted into the medium, suggesting that CTB4 mediates cercosporin export (Choquer et al., 2007). When stimulated by high light conditions, CTB4 mutants secreted a dark brown compound of unknown nature that quickly diffused into the solid medium.

The development of gene\u2010editing technologies such as CRISPR\u2010Cas9 (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014), which also revolutionized genetic editing in a broad variety of filamentous fungi as highlighted in multiple reviews (Idnurm and Meyer, 2018; Schuster and Kahmann, 2019; Song et al., 2019; Vicente et al., 2019), could be employed to investigate gene function via allele replacement in addition to gene knockouts. This would facilitate the identification of important genes and mutations for virulence in C.\u00a0beticola. Breeding for effective host resistance to CLS with minimal yield penalty will continue to be important and may be expedited by gene\u2010editing techniques if effective gene targets are identified. Additionally, because cercosporin is a virulence factor for the fungus, transferring a cassette of fungal\u2010derived cercosporin AR genes to sugar beet could be a method to establish durable resistance in the host. Molecular advances will continue to help us understand additional aspects of CLS disease. The elucidation of the molecular basis of fungicide resistances is allowing us to better monitor and manage resistant populations in the field so that we can maintain the efficacy of current available fungicides. It will be imperative in the future to identify key primary sources of inoculum and establish biological mechanisms used by C.\u00a0beticola to generate genetic diversity. Ultimately, improved knowledge of host\u2013pathogen interactions will aid in successful integrated management of CLS.", "Future studies of CLS disease in sugar beet can exploit the wealth of genetic and genomic resources that have become available in recent years for both C.\u00a0beticola (de Jonge et al., 2018) and its hosts (Dohm et al., 2014; del R\u00edo et al., 2019).
