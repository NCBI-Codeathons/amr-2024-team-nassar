["Present address: School of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Science, University of South Wales, Pontypridd, Wales, UK.", "Screening microbial cultures for specialised metabolites is essential for the discovery of new biologically active compounds. A novel, cost-effective and rapid screening method is described for extracting specialised metabolites from bacteria grown on agar plates, coupled with HPLC for basic identification of known and potentially novel metabolites. The method allows the screening of culture collections to identify optimal production strains and metabolite induction conditions. The protocol was optimised on two Burkholderia species known to produce the antibiotics, enacyloxin IIa (B. ambifaria) and gladiolin (B. gladioli), respectively; it was then applied to strains of each species to identify high antibiotic producers. B. ambifaria AMMD and B. gladioli BCC0238 produced the highest concentrations of the respective antibiotic under the conditions tested. To induce expression of silent biosynthetic gene clusters, the addition of low concentrations of antibiotics to growth media was evaluated as known elicitors of Burkholderia specialised metabolites. Subinhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim and other clinically therapeutic antibiotics were evaluated and screened against a panel of B. gladioli and B. ambifaria. To enhance rapid strain screening with more antibiotic elicitors, antimicrobial susceptibility testing discs were included within the induction medium. Low concentrations of trimethoprim suppressed the production of specialised metabolites in B. gladioli, including the toxins, toxoflavin and bongkrekic acid. However, the addition of trimethoprim significantly improved enacylocin IIa concentrations in B. ambifaria AMMD. Rifampicin and ceftazidime significantly improved the yield of gladiolin and caryoynencin by B. gladioli BCC0238, respectively, and cepacin increased 2-fold with tobramycin in B. ambifaria BCC0191. Potentially novel metabolites were also induced by subinhibitory concentrations of tobramycin and chloramphenicol in B. ambifaria. In contrast to previous findings that low concentrations of antibiotic elicit Burkholderia metabolite production, we found they acted as both inducers or suppressors dependent on the metabolite and the strains producing them. In conclusion, the screening protocol enabled rapid characterization of Burkholderia metabolites, the identification of suitable producer strains, potentially novel natural products and an understanding of metabolite regulation in the presence of inducing or suppressing conditions.", "Graphical abstract", "Unlabelled Image", "Unlabelled Image", "Highlights", "\u2022A rapid screening method for extracting specialised metabolites from Burkholderia and other bacteria was developed\u2022The method allowed screening of culture collections to identify production strains and metabolite induction conditions\u2022Screening provided an understanding of metabolite regulation in the presence of different inducing and suppressing conditions", "A rapid screening method for extracting specialised metabolites from Burkholderia and other bacteria was developed", "The method allowed screening of culture collections to identify production strains and metabolite induction conditions", "Screening provided an understanding of metabolite regulation in the presence of different inducing and suppressing conditions", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Microbial specialised (also known as secondary) metabolites continue to be a source of new biologically active molecules for use in medicine and agriculture (B\u00e9rdy 2005; Rutledge and Challis 2015). However, their production, extraction and identification from bacterial growth medium can be complicated, labour intensive, and time consuming. Natural product extraction methods from microbial sources frequently involve the use of freeze-drying, evaporation under vacuum, adsorption to ion-exchange resins, or use of large volumes of harmful solvents (Seidel 2012; Sterner 2012). In addition, the production of microbial compounds are frequently influenced by different cultivation parameters (e.g. nutrients, light, temperature, pH, and aeration) (Bode et al. 2002, Pettit 2011, Begani et al. 2018) and identifying optimum growth conditions can require labour intensive screening. This has prompted the investigation of alternative approaches to identifying novel metabolites, such as high throughput screening (HTS) of synthetic compound libraries and fragment-based design (Payne et al. 2006; Doak et al. 2016). However, these approaches have had limited success due to the nature of the developed assay to screen large numbers of compounds. In both cases, inhibition of the target protein by the tested compounds is assessed outside the context of the cell, and unfortunately lead compounds are often found to be ineffective in cell-based assays (Rutledge and Challis 2015).", "Microbial specialised (also known as secondary) metabolites continue to be a source of new biologically active molecules for use in medicine and agriculture (B\u00e9rdy 2005; Rutledge and Challis 2015).

Genome sequencing coupled with specific genome mining tools, such as antiSMASH (Medema et al. 2011), has revealed that multiple microorganisms, beyond the traditionally exploited Streptomyces genus (Hopwood 2019) have excellent potential to produce specialised metabolites encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Trivella and de Felicio 2018).

Ultimately, further analyses beyond HPLC such as mass identification by LC-MS or structure elucidation by NMR are required for accurate compound identification (Mahenthiralingam et al. 2011; Song et al. 2017). However, for initial metabolite profiling, optimisation of extraction conditions and identifying production strains, the protocol proved very useful.", "The use of reversed-phase HPLC in gradient mode is a technique widely used to evaluate compound diversity in organic solvent extracts of microbial specialised metabolites grown in liquid media (e.g. Higgs et al. 2001; Tormo et al. 2003; Rutledge and Challis 2015). However, its use directly from extracts from solid media is less frequent. The direct analysis of samples from standardised agar plates increased the high throughput nature of the protocol allowing for greater sample replication and reproducibility, and the investigation of multiple growth conditions. It also modelled biofilm and high-density surface growth conditions which are preferred by multiple bacteria and known to activate regulatory systems such as quorum sensing, essential for expression of certain antibiotics (e.g. enacyloxin IIa; Mahenthiralingam et al. 2011). In addition, the method also allows rapid screening and identification of new strains that naturally produce higher levels of desired compounds (see below). Downstream of HPLC, genetic engineering can aid compound identification by comparative metabolite analysis of gene knockout mutants and wild-type strains (Kunakom and Eust\u00e1quio 2019). For example, cepacin and its related HPLC peak was determined in B. ambifaria BCC0191 after the BGC encoding cepacin was disrupted through insertional mutagenesis (Mullins et al. 2019). Similarly, the use of known standard compounds analysed alongside metabolite extracts can also help identify unknown peaks.

Results showed that strains B. ambifaria AMMD and B. gladioli BCC0238 were the optimum strains for the induction and production of enacyloxin IIa and gladiolin, respectively under the conditions tested. For both strains, significantly higher concentrations of antibiotics (n\u00a0=\u00a03; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were observed when compared with six other strains of the same species. Interestingly, the amounts of gladiolin produced by all B. gladioli strains evaluated were highly variable (Fig. 2), whereas enacyloxin IIa production was more consistent among the B. ambifaria strains tested, with the exceptions of AMMD (high concentration) and BCC1248 (low concentration).
