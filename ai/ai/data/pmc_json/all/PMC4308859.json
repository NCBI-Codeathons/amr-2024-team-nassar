["Current treatment strategies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) consisting of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or biological agents are not always effective, hence driving the demand for new experimental therapeutics. The antiproliferative capacity of proteasome inhibitors (PIs) has received considerable attention given the success of their first prototypical representative, bortezomib (BTZ), in the treatment of B cell and plasma cell-related hematological malignancies. Therapeutic application of PIs in an autoimmune disease setting is much less explored, despite a clear rationale of (immuno) proteasome involvement in (auto)antigen presentation, and PIs harboring the capacity to inhibit the activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB and suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6. Here, we review the clinical positioning of (immuno) proteasomes in autoimmune diseases, in particular RA, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome and sclerodema, and elaborate on (pre)clinical data related to the impact of BTZ and next generation PIs on immune effector cells (T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, osteoclasts) implicated in their pathophysiology. Finally, factors influencing long-term efficacy of PIs, their current (pre)clinical status and future perspectives as anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic agents are discussed.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation and hyperplasia, autoantibody production, and cartilage and bone destruction, the underlying cause of which lies in immune regulatory factors such as the loss of tolerance [1]. How this process is linked to a localized onset of inflammation in the joint is still unclear but it involves migration and accumulation of immune effector cells, including macrophages and osteoclasts, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), B cells and T cells [1]. Th17 subsets, which produce interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-21, also play a crucial role in the development of RA in combination with limited functional capabilities of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Current therapies for RA rely on early and aggressive treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate and glucocorticoids and/or biological agents. These mostly include antibodies to pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 and IL-6 and others, including rituximab (anti-CD20) and abatacept (CTLA4 IgG1 fusion protein), which also interfere with the underlying immune/inflammatory events. In general, monotherapy with DMARDs has limited long-term efficacy, probably as a consequence of multidrug resistance. Large clinical studies with long-term follow-up demonstrated that the use of combinations of conventional DMARDs, particularly methotrexate, with biological agents was highly effective in achieving clinical remission and preventing radiological deterioration in approximately 50% of RA patients, but the remaining 50% of patients still experienced insufficient disease activity reduction or sustained active disease [2]. Therefore, in RA treatment there is still room for investigational new drugs with novel mechanisms of action, including antibody-guided and small molecule-mediated targeting of specific cell types (T/B cells, macrophages, synoviocytes), cytokines and their receptors, and intracellular (signaling) pathways [1]. Janus kinase inhibitors and Spleen kinase inhibitors represent examples of these latter drugs, displaying great pre-clinical potential, but, as with biological agents, safety/toxicity issues apply [3].", "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation and hyperplasia, autoantibody production, and cartilage and bone destruction, the underlying cause of which lies in immune regulatory factors such as the loss of tolerance [1].

The proteasome has a 26S structure, which consists of the 19S regulator and the 20S central proteolytic core (Figure\u00a02A). Three \u03b2-subunits within the 20S core of the proteasome harbor its catalytic activity: the \u03b25 subunit (PSMB5, chymotrypsin-like activity), the \u03b21 subunit (PSMB6, caspase-like activity) and the \u03b22 subunit (PSMB7, trypsin-like activity) [7]. Upon stimulation by pro-inflammatory stimuli, for example interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 or TNF\u03b1, these constitutive proteasome subunits can be replaced by immunoproteasome subunits \u03b25i (PSMB8, LMP7), \u03b21i (PSMB9, LMP2) and \u03b22i (PSMB10, MECL1) and to assemble immunoproteasomes, along with PA28 as regulatory cap (Figure\u00a02B). Immunoproteasomes are mainly found in cells of hematological origin in which they convey specialized functions, including: a) facilitating endogenous antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I; b) splicing of antigenic peptides and cross-presentation of exogenous antigens via MHC class I on DCs; and c) preserving protein homeostasis after IFN-\u03b3-induced oxidative stress [5,8]. Beyond this, hybrid variants of immunoproteasomes with constitutive subunits also have been identified in murine heart tissue as well as in human liver, colon, small intestine, kidneys, tumor cells and DCs [9]. These hybrid forms displayed unique antigen-processing properties, thereby expanding the repertoire of antigen presentation by specific cells. Apart from constitutive proteasomes and immunoproteasomes, a third proteasome variant, designated thymo-proteasomes, was identified in cortical thymic epithelial cells.

In other pre-clinical models of plasmacytoid DCs, effects of proteasome inhibition with BTZ, and also carfilzomib (CFZ) and ONX 0914, established inhibition of Toll-like receptor trafficking, IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 production and induction of apoptosis [41,42]. DC development and function upon differentiation in the presence of IFN-\u03b1 were as equally sensitive to inhibition by BTZ as by the immunoproteasome inhibitor ONX 0914 (Verbrugge and colleagues, submitted).", "DCs are the most powerful professional antigen-presenting cells and also control other players and processes of the immune system through the release of regulatory or stimulatory cytokines, depending on their developmental stage and activation state. DCs, for instance, control peripheral tolerance by inducing either anergy or depletion of autoreactive T cells. Two major DC subsets are derived from a common hematopoietic progenitor cell and abnormalities in both myeloid DCs as plasmacytoid DCs are associated with the development, maintenance and progression of several autoimmune diseases [39]. For their development and function, DCs heavily rely on the UPS and thus the effects of proteasome inhibition on the functionality of DCs have been the subject of extensive studies. In myeloid DCs, proteasome inhibition by BTZ reduced the expression of the DC-specific subset and activation markers (CD40, CD86, CD80, HLA-DR, CD206, CD209 and CD83) and induced apoptosis (upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax), inhibition of Toll-like receptor signaling, and suppression of cytokine release (IL-12, TNF\u03b1) due to impaired nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03baB subunits RelA and RelB.

Examining the impact of long-term BTZ exposure in CD34+ DC progenitors in a sustainable cell line model of steady-state Langerhans cell differentiation revealed early differentiation in precursor cells along with enhanced cytokine-driven Langerhans cell differentiation and maturation. Mechanistically, this effect was associated with enhanced NF-\u03baB subunit RelB activation (Verbrugge and colleagues, submitted). Blanco and colleagues [39] reviewed their cytokine-induced monocyte-to-DC activation model that was created to demonstrate the contribution of inflammatory DCs arising under the influence of TNF\u03b1 and type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2) to the development of autoimmunity.

Over the past decade, B-cell-depleting agents such as the CD20-targeted antibody rituximab have highlighted the essential role B cells play in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, including RA and SLE [43]. The UPS is critically involved in B-cell development and function, for example through its regulation of CD20 expression, the expression of the B-cell receptor and B-cell antigen presentation [44]. Van Anken and colleagues [45] reported a series of changes occurring during differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, starting with the expansion of metabolic capacity and the secretory machinery to accommodate the massive IgM production by plasma cells. Initially, it was rationalized that the increased protein turn-over in these cells would be accompanied by increased proteasome activity and that this feature would render them particularly susceptible to proteasome inhibition and accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, eliciting an apoptotic response. Later studies indicated that this increased susceptibility to proteasome inhibition was not necessarily due to increased proteasome levels and activity, but rather to stabilization of pro-apoptotic proteins leading to cell death [46]. Notably, several rodent models exhibited this increased susceptibility of plasma cells to proteasome inhibition. Neubert and colleagues [26] showed that reduced nephritis in mice with lupus-like disease was attributed to BTZ-induced plasma cell reduction. Beneficial effects from BTZ therapy were observed also in an experimental model of myasthenia gravis [47]. Also, selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome by ONX 0914 suppressed progression of experimental arthritis accompanied by a decrease in circulating levels of autoantibodies [27]. The next-generation PIs delanzomib and CFZ also showed promising anti-inflammatory effects by reducing autoantibody levels in mice with lupus [42]. These preclinical findings hold promise for the treatment not only of autoimmune diseases with increased plasma cell levels, but also for those in which autoantibody levels are critical determinants. Lastly, in vitro studies with human B lymphoblastoid cells showed that chronic exposure to BTZ led to upregulated CD20 expression levels due to impaired proteasome-mediated CD20 degradation.

For the PI BTZ, emergence of acquired resistance has been associated with reduced efficacy in the treatment of hematological malignancies [23]. In an autoimmune disease setting, where patients often require chronic drug administration, long-term efficacy may also be potentially hampered by the emergence of resistance phenomena. Over the past years, studies based on in vitro model systems revealed several mechanisms that may contribute to diminished efficacy with PIs and acquisition of resistance. One mechanism of PI resistance relates to the increased expression of proteasome subunits as a primary response to overcome PI targeting. In this respect, PSMB5 (\u03b25) subunits were often found upregulated upon BTZ exposure in BTZ-resistant cells to compensate for inhibitory effects on proteasome activity [51]. Interestingly, Martinez-Gamboa and colleagues [52] observed that intrinsic factors and aberrant proteasome activation established dysregulation of \u03b21i proteasome subunit expression in B lymphocytes of SS patients, conferring diminished PI inhibition and resistance to apoptosis. PI exposure and resistance may also provoke alterations in the relative composition of constitutive and immunoproteasome subunits, the impact of which on immune functions is not clear [53,54]. Another mechanism of acquired resistance to PIs is mediated by point mutations in the PSMB5 gene encoding the PSMB5 (\u03b25) subunit. This introduces amino acid alterations in the BTZ binding pocket of the PSMB5 (\u03b25) subunit of the proteasome and confers diminished efficiency of BTZ binding. These mutations have been described in BTZ-resistant hematological cell line models, but have not yet been reported in biopsies or cell samples from patients experiencing clinical resistance to BTZ [51,53,55]. Interestingly, nature provides a precedent for PSMB5 mutations as the marine bacterium Salinospora tropica generates self-resistance to the PI salinosporamide A (marizomib) it produces by upregulating a mutated form of the PSMB5 (\u03b25) subunit that harbors a single amino acid substitution identical to those found in hematological cell lines with acquired BTZ resistance [51,53]. A third recognized resistance mechanism operates via selective drug efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette family, known to confer multidrug resistance, which could facilitate cellular extrusion of specific PIs [56]. Whereas BTZ appeared to be a relatively poor substrate for drug efflux transporters, next-generation PIs such as CFZ, ONX 0912 (oprozomib) and ONX 0914 were found to be proficient substrates for the efflux transporter MDR1 (P-glycoprotein (Pgp)). Of interest, inhibition of Pgp could reverse resistance to these [51,54]. Since Pgp is constitutively expressed on lymphocytes from RA patients, and its expression is correlated with disease activity, both basal levels of expression and upregulated levels upon long-term administration could be limiting factors in sustaining long-term efficacy [56].", "Regardless whether it concerns classical DMARDs, biological agents or experimental drugs, loss of efficacy due to primary or acquired resistance remains a recurrent theme in sustaining long-term therapeutic effects during treatment of autoimmune diseases [49,50].
