Since previously reported lantibiotic synthetases show no apparent homology with any other known protein families, the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary origin of these enzymes are unknown. In this study, we present a novel class of lanthionine synthetases, termed LanL, that consist of three distinct catalytic domains and demonstrate in vitro enzyme activity of a family member from Streptomyces venezuelae. Analysis of individually expressed and purified domains shows that LanL enzymes install dehydroamino acids via phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues by a protein kinase domain and subsequent elimination of the phosphate by a phosphoSer/Thr lyase domain. The latter has sequence homology with the phosphothreonine lyases found in various pathogenic bacteria that inactivate host mitogen activated protein kinases. A LanC-like cyclase domain then catalyzes the addition of Cys residues to the dehydro amino acids to form the characteristic thioether rings. We propose that LanL enzymes have evolved from stand-alone protein Ser/Thr kinases, phosphoSer/Thr lyases, and enzymes catalyzing thiol alkylation. We also demonstrate that the genes for all three pathways to lanthionine-containing peptides are widespread in Nature. Given the remarkable efficiency of formation of lanthionine-containing polycyclic peptides and the latter's high degree of specificity for their cognate cellular targets, it is perhaps not surprising that (at least) three distinct families of polypeptide sequences have evolved to access this structurally and functionally diverse class of compounds.", "Author Summary", "Many bacteria generate cyclic peptides, which have improved biological activities compared to linear peptides, including higher stability. Lanthionine-containing peptides are one such group, and different members of this group have antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities. For example, one lanthionine-containing peptide called nisin has been used to protect food items from harmful bacteria. Two different pathways for the biosynthesis of lanthionine-containing peptides have been described previously. By comparing the DNA sequences of bacterial genomes we reveal a third biosynthetic route that provides further insight into how the biosynthetic pathways for these cyclic peptides have evolved. We characterized the novel lanthionine synthetase utilized in this third pathway in the soil bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae and show that the purified enzyme catalyzes the chemical reactions necessary to turn a linear peptide into a peptide with multiple rings. The discovery of this third biosynthetic pathway widens the scope for the engineering of new lanthionine-containing peptides for potential use in human therapeutics.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Macrocyclization is a common strategy to constrain the conformational flexibility of natural peptides of both ribosomal and nonribosomal origin [1], thereby conferring increased proteolytic stability and improved affinity for their targets. Lantibiotic synthetases are remarkable catalysts that achieve macrocyclization by utilizing two simple posttranslational modification reactions, dehydration of Ser/Thr residues and subsequent intramolecular addition of Cys thiols to the dehydro amino acids to generate thioether crosslinks called (methyl)lanthionines [2]. The resulting polycyclic products have high affinity for their various targets, which to date all consist of small molecules [3]. For instance, nisin binds with high affinity to the bacterial cell wall precursor lipid II [4], and cinnamycin specifically recognizes phosphatidyl ethanolamine [5]. Nisin is the most studied lantibiotic [6] and has been used commercially to combat food-borne pathogens for 40 years in more than 80 countries without widespread development of resistance. A remarkable feature of lantibiotic biosynthesis is the extraordinary efficiency by which one or two enzymes typically generate 3\u20135 rings from a linear precursor peptide. How these exceptional catalysts carry out their reactions with apparently high promiscuity and yet a high degree of control and what their evolutionary origin is has not been clear since they have no obvious homology with other protein families in the databases.

For class I lantibiotics, LanB dehydratases convert Ser and Thr present in precursor peptides to dehydroalanine (Dha) and Z-dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), respectively.

With three rings assigned, the final ring would have to form between Cys50 and Dhb31. Collectively, the only structure that can account for the regions that are protected from fragmentation in all VenA peptides tested is the ring topology shown in Figure 4F. Future NMR studies will be needed to further confirm this structure, but these will require much larger amounts of material than can currently be obtained.", "In the tandem mass spectra of the VenA, VenA-C34A, and VenA-C45A peptides, no fragmentation was observed in the C-terminal region (Dhb31\u2013Ala51) except for a fragment ion resulting from cleavage between Cys50 and Ala51 (Figure 4A\u2013C). This observation suggests that the processed VenA peptide contains overlapping cyclic structures between Dhb31 and Cys50; such cyclic structures are less susceptible to fragmentation than linear regions [8]. Additional ions were observed in the C-terminal region in the spectrum of VenL-processed VenA-C32A (Figure 4D), providing more insights into the ring pattern. Two segments were still protected from fragmentation (Cys34\u2013Dhb39 and Cys45\u2013Dha49), implying the formation of a MeLan between Cys34 and Dhb39 and a Lan between Cys45 and Dha49. The fragmentations that are observed around Dhb32 and Dhb43 in this mutant suggest that these two Dhb residues, whose cyclization partners would be Cys32 and Cys50, are not cyclized. Hence, disruption of a MeLan involving Cys32, which is mutated in VenA-C32A, appears to interfere with formation of another ring. Nonetheless, the fragmentation pattern limits the ring topology to two possibilities: Cys32\u2013Dhb43 and Cys50\u2013Dhb31, or Cys32\u2013Dhb31 and Cys50\u2013Dhb43, in addition to the two assigned rings (Cys34\u2013Dhb39 and Cys45\u2013Dha49). VenA-C50A was also treated with VenL and the product analyzed by ESI-Q/ToF MS (Figure 4E). The large number of fragmentations in the C-terminal region suggests that Cys45 is not cyclized by VenL when Cys50 is mutated. On the other hand, protection from fragmentation in the N-terminal region strongly supports ring formation between Cys32 and Dhb43. With three rings assigned, the final ring would have to form between Cys50 and Dhb31. Collectively, the only structure that can account for the regions that are protected from fragmentation in all VenA peptides tested is the ring topology shown in Figure 4F.
