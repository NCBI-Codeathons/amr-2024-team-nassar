["The global public health threat of antimicrobial resistance has led the scientific community to highly engage into research on alternative strategies to the traditional small molecule therapeutics. Here, we review one of the most popular alternatives amongst basic and applied research scientists, synthetic antimicrobial peptides. The ease of peptide chemical synthesis combined with emerging engineering principles and potent broad-spectrum activity, including against multidrug-resistant strains, has motivated intense scientific focus on these compounds for the past decade. This global effort has resulted in significant advances in our understanding of peptide antimicrobial activity at the molecular scale. Recent evidence of molecular targets other than the microbial lipid membrane, and efforts towards consensus antimicrobial peptide motifs, have supported the rise of molecular engineering approaches and design tools, including machine learning. Beyond molecular concepts, supramolecular chemistry has been lately added to the debate; and helped unravel the impact of peptide self-assembly on activity, including on biofilms and secondary targets, while providing new directions in pharmaceutical formulation through taking advantage of peptide self-assembled nanostructures. We argue that these basic research advances constitute a solid basis for promising industry translation of rationally designed synthetic peptide antimicrobials, not only as novel drugs against multidrug-resistant strains but also as components of emerging antimicrobial biomaterials. This perspective is supported by recent developments of innovative peptide-based and peptide-carrier nanobiomaterials that we also review.", "Keywords", "Background: the antibiotic resistance global threat and current molecular design approaches", "Background: the antibiotic resistance global threat and current molecular design approaches", "Historical perspective", "Historical perspective", "Historical perspective", "The first documented failure of antimicrobial therapy in humans due to acquired microbial resistance was reported in the 1940s for penicillin, which occurred only a few years after its commercialisation (Wright 2010).

A number of excellent reviews have compiled these mechanisms for the antimicrobial agents currently on the market (Table 1, Fig.\u00a01) (Davies and Davies 2010; Malmir et al. 2018; Ribeiro da Cunha et al. 2019; Magana et al. 2020).

However, for these new non-traditional approaches, the failure rate in clinical trials is considerably higher than that of proven pathways for new agents of existing antibiotic classes.

Apart from the peptide charge, the features mentioned above may be essential for their antimicrobial activity (Friedrich et al. 2000). AMPs have exhibited broad-spectrum activity against many Gram negative and Gram positive strains as well as fungi (Chung and Khanum 2017) and are produced by both animals and plants (Zasloff 2002). They have been used for the treatment of Candidiasis (Danesi et al. 2002) and have also been useful against replication of HIV1 by eliminating viral gene expression (Wachinger et al. 1998). Antimicrobial peptides are part of the innate immune defence of organisms (Peschel and Sahl 2006); they may present antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic and antiviral activity (Hancock and Diamond 2000).

Although intracellular targets may provide an interesting addition or alternative for the molecular engineering of AMPs, few synthetic peptides have been specifically designed to target such microbial components to date and few of these\u00a0peptide motifs have been identified (Le et al. 2017).", "Targeting microbial colonies: biofilm components and bacterial adhesion", "Targeting microbial colonies: biofilm components and bacterial adhesion", "Targeting microbial colonies: biofilm components and bacterial adhesion", "Bacterial biofilms are resilient drug-resistant communities of surface-adhered bacteria encapsulated within a sturdy extracellular matrix that acts as a physical barrier (Dunne Jr. 2002).

These polysaccharides are involved in surface adhesion during the initial stage of biofilm formation (Flemming 1993). Proteins and extracellular microbial DNA are also major components of biofilm systems (Whitchurch et al. 2002; Flemming and Wingender 2010). Exopolysaccharides effect a local environment like that of an extracellular matrix, allowing for microbial cells to remain attached to the surface and resist shear forces (Donlan and Costerton 2002). Biofilm-residing microbial cells are less metabolically active than planktonic phase cells, allowing for perseverance in nutrient-deficient environments, and may contribute to higher resistance to antibiotics targeting metabolic pathways (Walters 3rd et al. 2003). In bacterial biofilms, the cells participate in communication via quorum sensing (QS) (Li and Tian 2012). QS arises from the bacterial generation and detection of signalling molecules called autoinducers (AIs), which are typically acyl homoserine lactones and other compounds biosynthesised from S-adenosylmethionine (Parveen and Cornell 2011; Papenfort and Bassler 2016). While Gram negative species utilise small molecule AIs, Gram positive bacteria such as S. aureus employ cyclic oligopeptides as autoinducer peptides (AIPs), which may be mimicked by synthetic peptides in order to block the quorum sensing pathway and the generation of virulence factors (Mayville et al. 1999; Thoendel et al. 2011; Zhu and Lau 2011).", "Aside from the cells themselves, microbial biofilms are primarily composed of exopolysaccharides such as the teichoic acids of Gram positive Staphylococci and several from Gram negative species such as P. aeruginosa (Byrd et al. 2009; Colvin et al. 2012).
