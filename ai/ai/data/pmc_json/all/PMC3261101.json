["Analysis of the simocyclinone biosynthesis (sim) gene cluster of Streptomyces antibioticus T\u00fc6040 led to the identification of a putative pathway specific regulatory gene simReg1. In silico analysis places the SimReg1 protein in the OmpR-PhoB subfamily of response regulators. Gene replacement of simReg1 from the S. antibioticus chromosome completely abolishes simocyclinone production indicating that SimReg1 is a key regulator of simocyclinone biosynthesis. Results of the DNA-shift assays and reporter gene expression analysis are consistent with the idea that SimReg1 activates transcription of simocyclinone biosynthesis, transporter genes, regulatory gene simReg3 and his own transcription. The presence of extracts (simocyclinone) from S. antibioticus T\u00fc6040 \u00d7 pSSimR1-1 could dissociate SimReg1 from promoter regions. A preliminary model for regulation of simocyclinone biosynthesis and export is discussed.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The actinomycetes, including in particular members of the genus Streptomyces, are the industrial source for a large number of bioactive compounds employed as antibiotics and other drugs Horinouchi 2007; Bibb and Hesketh 2009. Actinomycetes produce these molecules as part of their ''secondary'' or nonessential metabolism van Wezel et al. 2009. Many Streptomyces species are capable of producing more than one secondary metabolite Ohnishi et al. 2008; van Wezel et al. 2009. The timing of the production of secondary metabolites and the amount of the accumulated compounds correlates with the environmental conditions and morphological differentiation van Wezel et al. 2009; Bibb et al. 2009; van Wezel et al. 2011. Furthermore, it has also been associated with the accumulation of small signaling molecules, such as ppGpp, microbial hormones, and late intermediates or end-products of the secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways Ruiz et al. 2008; O'Rourke et al. 2009; Hsiao et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2009. The influence of all aforementioned factors in most cases is reflected to the activity of the pathway-specific regulatory genes, which are believed to be final checkpoints in the onset of antibiotic production Arias et al. 1999; Nuria et al. 2007; van Wezel et al. 2009; Pulsawat et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2009. Because most antibiotics are potentially lethal to the producing organism, the onset of antibiotic production should be under tight control and mechanisms of self-resistance of producing bacteria must exist. All this requires a precise regulatory network coordinating both, biosynthesis and resistance genes expression Le et al. 2009. That is why very often resistance genes are linked to antibiotic biosynthesis genes Tahlan et al. 2007; Ostash et al. 2008. As our understanding of secondary metabolism advances, it is becoming clear that the relationship between antibiotic production and resistance is more complicated than expected. For example, in S. coelicolor, along with the mature antibiotic(s), intermediates of the biosynthetic pathway might activate expression of the export genes, thereby coupling resistance to biosynthesis Hopwood 2007. In S. cyanogenus intermediates are able, not only to release repression of the export machinery, but also to de-repress expression of the late biosynthetic enzymes that attach the final sugars to yield mature landomycin A Ostash et al. 2008. However, despite the identification and characterization of numerous genes, which affect antibiotic production and resistance, our understanding of the regulatory networks that govern these processes is far from complete.", "The actinomycetes, including in particular members of the genus Streptomyces, are the industrial source for a large number of bioactive compounds employed as antibiotics and other drugs Horinouchi 2007; Bibb and Hesketh 2009.

To investigate whether SimReg1 can activate the expression of the structural genes under heterologous conditions, a reporter system on the basis of gusA was used. For these purpose, we constructed two plasmids pSimD4script and pUWLsimReg1 (Table 1). In the first plasmid the promoter region of the putative ketoreductase gene simD4 (PD4) was fused with the coding sequence of the gusA gene. As a result expression of the reporter gusA is controlled by PD4. In the plasmid pUWLsimReg1 intact gene simReg1 was cloned under the control of erythromycin resistance gene promoter to make the expression of the regulatory gene constitutive.
