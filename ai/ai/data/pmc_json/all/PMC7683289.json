["Antimicrobials against bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens have transformed human and animal health. Nevertheless, their widespread use (and misuse) has led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which poses a potentially catastrophic threat to public health and animal husbandry. There are several routes, both intrinsic and acquired, by which AMR can develop. One major route is through non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in coding regions. Large scale genomic studies using high-throughput sequencing data have provided powerful new ways to rapidly detect and respond to such genetic mutations linked to AMR. However, these studies are limited in their mechanistic insight. Computational tools can rapidly and inexpensively evaluate the effect of mutations on protein function and evolution. Subsequent insights can then inform experimental studies, and direct existing or new computational methods. Here we review a range of sequence and structure-based computational tools, focussing on tools successfully used to investigate mutational effect on drug targets in clinically important pathogens, particularly Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Combining genomic results with the biophysical effects of mutations can help reveal the molecular basis and consequences of resistance development. Furthermore, we summarise how the application of such a mechanistic understanding of drug resistance can be applied to limit the impact of AMR.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)", "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)", "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)", "Drugs against bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens have truly revolutionised modern medicine, transforming human health and saving millions of lives.

Some are primarily based on conservation or substitution matrices, and do not require a protein structure as input (Sequence-based methods). Others consider the local environment of the variant within the protein structure in their calculation (Structure-based methods). In the presence of a known AMR-related phenotype, these tools are useful as they provide mechanistic insight which may explain how resistance is brought about at the protein level. Therefore, when analysing specific proteins, it can be beneficial to use different methodologies, as different strategies may give complementary information.

Therefore, the utility of these tools in understanding AMR mechanisms lies in the actual scores, where a comparison of different scores across variants, accounting for their genetic position can uncover important underlying mechanisms and trends related to evolutionary conservation.

It provides an estimate of the \u0394\u0394G upon a single point mutation based on protein structure (or sequence). The resulting \u0394\u0394G highlights the extent as well as the direction of impact (\u0394\u0394G\u00a0<\u00a00: destabilising, \u0394\u0394G\u00a0>\u00a00: stabilising) on the protomer. The predictions consider the mutated residue environment as a 9\u00a0\u00c5 region (structure) and a 19-residue window (sequence) surrounding the mutation. This environment is combined with experimental pH and temperature conditions, enabling the user to define different pH and temperature conditions on a case-by-case basis to better encompass protein biological conditions [116].d.STRUM is an ML based predictor and returns an estimate of the \u0394\u0394G of a single point mutation on 3D models based on wild-type sequences. It can be used to analyse single mutations or all possible mutations within a specified region of the protein. Similar to methods above, both the magnitude of change as well as the direction (\u0394\u0394G\u00a0<\u00a00: destabilising, \u0394\u0394G\u00a0>\u00a00: stabilising) are encapsulated in the predictions. The 3D models are generated using iterative threading assembly and combined physics- and knowledge-based energy functions.

A total of 120 features are trained through Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) to overcome overfitting effects [117].", "The introduction of resistance-causing missense mutations to a protein structure rarely comes at a negligible cost to protein stability, whether decreasing local stability and affecting protein folding, or increasing local stability and compromising wild-type protein dynamics [112]. Therefore, quantifying the effect of missense mutations on stability presents a good starting point in understanding the basic variant protein changes. Computational tools predicting thermodynamic stability of a protein do so by estimating the Gibbs free energy (\u0394G Kcal/mol). The subsequent impact of a point mutation on protein stability is then estimated as a change in the Gibbs free energy (\u0394\u0394G Kcal/mol) between wild-type and mutant proteins, or vice versa. Additionally, these tools provide both the extent (the actual value of \u0394\u0394G) as well as the direction (destabilising/stabilising) of the resulting mutational effect. Different in silico protein stability predictors are available, of which we highlight a few, based on the methodologies considered in their approximations. Further details for these (and additional) methods can be found in Table 1.a.FoldX is an empirical-based predictor which provides information on how a single point mutation alters the stability of a protein. It constructs structure models of the protein with the mutation and estimates the stability (\u0394G) associated with the mutant protein. Estimation of stability is based on intramolecular interactions such as van der Waals\u2019 forces, solvation energies, interactions with water, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic effects and main and side chain entropies. Mutational impact is calculated through a weighted summation of all the intramolecular interactions, and estimated as a change in stability (\u0394\u0394G) between mutant and wild-type structures. In this way, \u0394G for each mutant protein, \u0394\u0394G upon mutation, and the contribution of each intramolecular interaction, are made available to the user. The extent of the mutational impact (the value of \u0394\u0394G) as well as the direction of change (\u0394\u0394G\u00a0<\u00a00: stabilising, \u0394\u0394G\u00a0>\u00a00: destabilising) are captured by the predictions [113], [114].b.PoPMuSic (v2.1) is a statistical method which uses knowledge-based potentials to predict mutational impact on the stability of a protein. It returns the predicted \u0394\u0394G of a single point mutation of a protein and is able to systematically analyse this for all possible point mutations for a given protein. Additionally, an \u2018optimality\u2019 score for each amino acid in the sequence with respect to stability is returned. The optimality score identifies sites of structural weakness i.e. clusters of residues that are considered non-optimal from an evolutionary perspective. Therefore, mutations with desired stability properties (\u0394\u0394G\u00a0<\u00a00: stabilising, \u0394\u0394G\u00a0>\u00a00: destabilising) and poorly optimised positions can be identified.

Measuring the impact of missense mutations beyond protein stability, by looking at functional affinities, is crucial to characterise the mechanisms of AMR-associated mutations. This is because affinities to ligands, nucleic acids and other proteins are highly dependent on specific interaction sites, irrespective of protein stability changes. Functionally, protein affinity changes to its ligand is especially important in AMR, as it enables the identification of mutations directly affecting ligand binding. The extent of this importance, however, relates to the drug mode of action, meaning that other functional affinities should also be considered to identify mechanisms beyond direct ligand binding. The mCSM suite of tools quantify these stability and functional measurements using graph-based signatures [121], which summarise the global environment of the protein as a series of nodes for each atom, and represents the local environment at the mutation site as edges on the graph between the nodes at similar distances from the mutation. A pharmacophore count is appended to these signatures to account for any physicochemical changes imparted by the missense mutations [122]\n(Fig. 1). Through this graph-based network, the impact of a missense mutation over the whole protein can be calculated.
