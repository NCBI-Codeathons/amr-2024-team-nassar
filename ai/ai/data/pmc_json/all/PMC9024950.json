Many bacteria have been isolated, having algicidal effects on harmful algal species, while few algicidal bacteria have been found to be able to lyse A. pacificum. Herein, an algicidal bacterium, Shewanella Y1, with algicidal activity to the toxic dinoflagellate A. pacificum, was isolated from Jiaozhou Bay, China, and the physiological responses to oxidative stress in A. pacificum were further investigated to elucidate the mechanism involved in Shewanella Y1. Y1 exhibited a significant algicidal effect (86.64 \u00b1 5.04% at 24 h) and algicidal activity in an indirect manner. The significant declines of the maximal photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), initial slope of the light limited region (alpha), and maximum relative photosynthetic electron transfer rate (rETRmax) indicated that the Y1 filtrate inhibited photosynthetic activities of A. pacificum. Impaired photosynthesis induced the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caused strong oxidative damage in A. pacificum, ultimately inducing cell death. These findings provide a better understanding of the biological basis of complex algicidal bacterium-harmful algae interactions, providing a potential source of bacterial agent to control harmful algal blooms.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Over the last decades, harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased in intensity and frequency and have turned into a serious ecological issue in coastal waters worldwide [1,2,3,4]. Toxic bloom-forming dinoflagellates can not only negatively influence their predators, including heterotrophic dinoflagellates [5], copepods [6], ciliates [7] and other zooplankton [8], but also have significantly negative impacts on co-occurring phytoplankton by releasing secondary metabolites as allelopathic chemicals [9]. Alexandrium pacificum, a typical toxic-HAB-causing dinoflagellate capable of discoloring seawater with sufficient cell densities, is commonly observed in estuarine and coastal waters around the world [10,11]. Frequent blooms of this species have been reported in the South China Sea, Ofunato Bay, Japan, Jinhae-Masan Bay, Korea, and Bizerte Lagoon, resulting in significant ecological damage and economic loss [12,13,14,15]. Furthermore, A. pacificum is a major producer of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) [16]. Although PSP does not directly lead to the death of marine animals, it enters the human body through the food chain after being ingested by marine animals, and then poses a threat to human health and life safety [17,18].", "Over the last decades, harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased in intensity and frequency and have turned into a serious ecological issue in coastal waters worldwide [1,2,3,4].

However, the number of identified algicidal substances is remarkably lower than that of reported algicidal bacteria, which may be attributed to a limitation in the separation and purification methods and identification technology for algicidal compounds.", "Adding only the filtrate or exudate from the bacterial culture was used to distinguish between direct or indirect attack. Our algicidal mode experiment showed that the Y1 filtrate had algicidal activity similar to that of the Y1 cultures, but the washed bacterial pellets cultures showed dramatically lower algicidal activity, suggesting that strain Y1 indirectly attacks A. pacificum by secreting extracellular algicidal substances. Various algicidal strains have been classified based on their algicidal modes; while approximately 70% of the strains exhibited indirect algicidal attacks, the remaining exhibited direct algicidal attacks [27,28]. It is worth noting that individual strains showed both direct and indirect algicidal attacks [45,56]. Current data indicate that Proteobacteria are typically involved in indirect attacks, even though there is no clear link between bacterial class and algicidal mode [26,28]. The evident algicidal activity in the filtrate suggested that these strains could suppress algal cells via an indirect attack by releasing extracellular algicidal substances such as proteins, enzymes, or biological surfactants [57,58,59,60]. However, the number of identified algicidal substances is remarkably lower than that of reported algicidal bacteria, which may be attributed to a limitation in the separation and purification methods and identification technology for algicidal compounds.", "In the filtrate-added cultures, the three key photosynthetic parameters showed a significant decrease compared with that of control cultures over the experimental period, suggesting that the photosynthetic activities were significantly suppressed. Impaired photosynthesis could block the electron transport, which would promote electron spillage and cause a significant increase in ROS production [61,62]. The elevated ROS in algal cells could cause significant dysfunction of physiological and metabolic processes, which could damage the crucial biomacromolecules including DNA, lipids, and proteins [42]. The ROS level in filtrate-added cultures was significantly higher than that of control cultures. The CAT and SOD activities and GSH contents were significantly enhanced at 1 h inoculation, suggesting that CAT, SOD, and GSH were activated to resist oxidative stress. Under the self-resistance of algal cells, the ROS level began to decrease after 2 h, but the effect was not completely alleviated. The MDA contents of A. pacificum after exposure to Y1 filtrate increased significantly in a short time, resulting in oxidative damage of membrane system (including plasma membrane and thylakoid membrane) and death of algal cells. These results suggested that Y1 filtrate could inhibit photosynthetic activities, induce the production of a large amount of ROS, cause oxidative damage to the membrane system, and eventually lead to cell rupture and death.", "In the filtrate-added cultures, the three key photosynthetic parameters showed a significant decrease compared with that of control cultures over the experimental period, suggesting that the photosynthetic activities were significantly suppressed.

Conclusions", "5. Conclusions", "In conclusion, Shewanella Y1 isolated from Jiaozhou Bay, China exerted a strong algicidal effect on Alexandrium pacificum, and algicidal activity in an indirect manner. Y1 filtrate altered physiological state, decreased cell density, inhibited photosynthetic activities, and caused strong oxidative damage in A. pacificum, ultimately inducing cell death. These findings highlight the fundamental cellular processes involved in the algicidal effects of Shewanella Y1 toward targeted algae collapsing. Further research on the discovery of algicidal compounds from Shewanella Y1 and their effect on harmful algal species should decode these complex algicidal mechanisms, which will enrich the species variety of algacidal bacteria and aid in developing strategies for controlling HABs.", "In conclusion, Shewanella Y1 isolated from Jiaozhou Bay, China exerted a strong algicidal effect on Alexandrium pacificum, and algicidal activity in an indirect manner.
