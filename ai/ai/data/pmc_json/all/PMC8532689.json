["Enterococcus spp. are one of the most frequent producers of bacteriocins (enterocins), which provides them with an advantage to compete in their natural environment, which is the gut of humans and many animals. The enterocins\u2019 activity against microorganisms from different phylogenetic groups has raised interest in Enterococcus spp. in different contexts throughout the last decades, especially in the food industry. Nevertheless, some species can also cause opportunistic life-threatening infections and are frequently multidrug-resistant (MDR). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), in particular, are an ongoing global challenge given the lack of therapeutic options. In this scenario, bacteriocins can offer a potential solution to this persistent threat, either alone or in combination with other antimicrobials. There are a handful of studies that demonstrate the advantages and applications of bacteriocins, especially against VRE. The purpose of this review is to present a current standpoint about the dual role of Enterococcus spp., from important producers to targets needed to be controlled, and the crucial role that enterocins may have in the expansion of enterococcal populations. Classification and distribution of enterocins, the current knowledge about the bacteriocinome of clinical enterococci, and the challenges of bacteriocin use in the fight against VRE infections are particularly detailed.", "1.

An emerging area of interest is the development of very-narrow-spectrum or species-specific antimicrobials, where the goal is to target only the microbe(s) that are actually causing infection, also limiting the selection for resistance and dysbiosis commonly induced in the coexisting beneficial microbiota by broad-spectrum antimicrobials [9]. Such an approach can include the use of bacteriocins, which are a subset of the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are produced by bacteria [10]. They are proteins or peptides, usually ribosomally synthesized, displaying antimicrobial activity towards strains of the same or other bacterial species, with an activity that is influenced by different environmental factors, such as temperature and pH, among others [11,12]. While some bacteriocins only exhibit antimicrobial activity against bacteria of the same species or against close phylogenetic groups, designated as narrow-spectrum bacteriocins, others are active against a variety of genera and, thus, display a broad antimicrobial activity. In this manner, bacteriocins are extremely diverse in structure, being encoded by complex and variable gene clusters, which go through rapid evolution and recurrent horizontal transfer, namely by plasmids [13]. These bacteriocin gene clusters usually encode the bacteriocin itself, but also biosynthetic enzymes, export and immunity mechanisms, and even quorum sensing bacteriocin production regulators. Bacteriocin producers usually protect themselves through self-immunity proteins and/or by efflux transporters [13].

The mechanisms behind their activity, which are not fully understood, are diverse and include the disruption of the cell membranes by pore formation (e.g., enterocin AS-48), and the impairment of cell wall synthesis (e.g., nisin) or of nucleic acid replication and translation (e.g., microcin B17) [13]. In contrast with antibiotics, which, to different extents, decrease bacterial diversity, generating opportunities for the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, and can create conditions for the development of antibiotic resistance, the action of bacteriocins can lead to different outcomes by promoting or preventing invasion by a new bacterial strain: (a) they may be an advantage to an invasive bacterial strain, allowing it to clear the resident community of bacteriocin-sensitive bacteria; (b) if produced by the resident community, they can act as a shield, preventing the colonization by a bacteriocin-susceptible invader (colonization resistance), although susceptible bacteria are not necessarily eradicated from a specific niche if they are spatially segregated from bacteriocin producers; and (c) bacteriocins can act as signaling peptides/quorum-sensing molecules in the complex gut network [13,17]. Clearly, bacteriocin production is a means to outcompete with other bacteria in mixed communities sharing limited nutrients, space, or adhesion sites to avoid clearance [13]. Moreover, when a bacteriocin is able to kill the competitive bacteria by lysis, it promotes the release of intracellular components, used as essential nutrients, as well as DNA that can be acquired by transformation events contributing to genomic diversity [13]. The fitness of a certain bacterial strain that is competing with bacteriocin-susceptible bacteria can be shaped by gain, loss, or diversification of bacteriocin genes. Nevertheless, a bacteriocin only generates a considerable fitness benefit while inhibiting relevant competitors but avoiding damage to dependent mutualists (for example, providing common nutrients) if the greater competitors are not able to develop resistance and if the fitness benefit is higher than the production metabolic cost [13]. This is a delicate balance, probably affected by yet unknown factors, between antagonistic and mutualistic strains shaping the human microbiome.

Millette et al. (2008) were the first to demonstrate that both nisin-Z- and pediocin PA-1-producing strains are capable of not only modulating the gut microbiota, but also of reducing the intestinal colonization of VRE in a mouse model. This pair of bacteriocins, isolated from L. lactis MM19 and Pediococcus acidilactici MM33, correspondingly, showed a great potential as antimicrobials able to control intestinal infections by VRE in vivo [111]. Additionally, the lantibiotic NAI-107 was found to be effective against VRE in vitro and Jab\u00e9s et al. (2011) was able to prove this result in vivo. NAI-107 was administrated intravenously to neutropenic mice and was highly potent against VanA E. faecium 569 and VanA E. faecalis A533 [112]. More recently, Kim et al. (2019) showed that a four-strained consortium of commensal bacteria (Clostridium bolteae, Blautia producta, Bacteroides sartorii, and Parabacteroides distasonis) restored colonization resistance against VREfm in antibiotic-treated mice [113]. Then, they showed that Blautia producta BPSCSK reduced VREfm growth through the secretion of a lantibiotic similar to the nisin-A produced by L. lactis [113]. Although VRE growth is inhibited by B. producta BPSCSK and by L. lactis in vitro, only B. producta BPSCSK colonized the colon and decreased VRE density in vivo, with reduced activity against other intestinal commensal bacteria. These authors also demonstrated a direct correlation between the amount of the bacteriocin gene and VRE reduction in germ-free mice containing patient feces [113]. There are a few studies addressing the effects of probiotic strains on VRE clearance of the gut microbiome; however, the specific mention to the bacteriocins they may carry acting as the driving force is lacking. For instance, Ubeda et al. (2013) reported that obligate anaerobic bacteria from the Barnesiella genus are able to clear VRE from the intestinal microbiota of mice [114]. Moreover, in two randomized controlled trials, one addressing adult nephrology patients and the other focusing on hospitalized pediatric patients, the authors reported that the ingestion of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG temporarily eliminates the gastrointestinal carriage of VRE [115]. Although these were favorable outcomes, there is the need to address the safety of the probiotic strain in immunocompromised patients, since that is still not clear.

On the other hand, the narrow spectrum of several bacteriocins, an advantage for microbiota maintenance, can be a limitation if we think that the causal strain of an infection needs to be accurately identified prior to bacteriocin treatment. Fortunately, recent strain-typing developments (mainly by genomics, but also spectroscopic assays) may evolve towards a routinely fast and cost-effective strain identification [121,122].", "Although broad-spectrum bacteriocins have been an attraction for food preservation due to their wide antimicrobial activity and expected safety, some studies already reported that, if they would be used as therapeutic agents, they could induce an unbalance among microbiota phyla (e.g., increase of Proteobacteria at the expense of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) similar to the broad-spectrum antibiotics [25,120].

Bacteriocin resistance seems to be less probable to happen when compared to antibiotics, with several factors contributing to that, namely: (i) bacteriocins of narrow spectrum only target specific bacteria, reducing the selective pressure on the nontargeted ones [10]; (ii) they can have different mechanisms of action (those who target the cell envelope and those that act within the cell, disturbing the expression of genes and protein production) [10]; (iii) they normally act fast, which decreases the possibility to develop resistance, if only susceptible cells are present [41]; (iv) bacteriocins interact with cell receptors that are so far known as different from those used by antibiotics, making cross-resistance among both types of antimicrobials less plausible [123]. Nevertheless, different bacterial mechanisms have been described to confer resistance to bacteriocins, which could be innate or acquired. They include immunity mimicry (functional homologues of bacteriocin immunity systems), bacteriocin degradation by bacterial enzymes, changes in bacterial cell wall and membrane, or mutations in regulatory elements [124]. Among enterococci, Drapper et al. (2009) reported that E. faecium DO strains were resistant to lacticin 3147 through immunity mimicry [125]. Another study described that E. faecalis strains can degrade and inactivate pediocin-like bacteriocins, which seemed to be related to the production of gelatinase, a metalloendopeptidase [126]. A number of studies have reported that bacteriocin resistance in class IIa bacteriocins involves downregulation of Man-PTS expression in both natural resistant isolates and spontaneous resistant mutants [42]. As an example, mutants of E. faecalis V583 resistant to pediocin PA-1 were found to have lower expression of the mpt operon encoding the mannose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in comparison to the wild-type strain [127]. Studies using mutants of E. faecalis and E. faecium resistant to pediocin PA-1 and mundticin KS, respectively, reported that changes in the membrane charge and composition were related to bacteriocin resistance [128,129]. Recently, spontaneous E. faecalis mutants showed resistance to the antimicrobial effects of BacL1 and BacA (from the bacteriolysin Bac41) due to a truncation deletion on the GalU protein leading to a cell-wall-associated polysaccharide defect [130]. Cases of cross-resistance among bacteriocins have also been reported. For example, nisin resistance in E. faecium DSMZ 20477 and in E. faecalis ATCC 29212 was found to confer cross-resistance to enterocin FH99 and pediocin 34 [131]. Knowledge of how bacteriocin resistance emerges and may evolve in vivo, namely among enterococci, is rather incomplete, with further investigations needed. A potential approach to avoid bacteriocin-resistant bacteria could be the combination of bacteriocins with different mechanisms of action or even combination of bacteriocins with other antimicrobial agents, such as conventional antibiotics, thus broadening their spectrum of action and antimicrobial activity [43]. Besides preventing resistance, combining bacteriocins with antibiotics can also have a lower impact on the intestinal microbiota. By working synergically, the dosage of both drugs can be lowered; hence, the side effects inherent to antibiotic treatment would be, in theory, slighter [11].", "A major drawback among antimicrobial compounds is bacterial resistance.
