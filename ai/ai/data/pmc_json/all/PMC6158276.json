["Strobilurins from fungi are the inspiration for the creation of the \u03b2-methoxyacrylate class of agricultural fungicides. However, molecular details of the biosynthesis of strobilurins have remained cryptic. Here we report the sequence of genomes of two fungi that produce strobilurins and show that each contains a biosynthetic gene cluster, which encodes a highly reducing polyketide synthase with very unusual C-terminal hydrolase and methyltransferase domains. Expression of stpks1 in Aspergillus oryzae leads to the production of prestrobilurin A when the fermentation is supplemented with a benzoyl coenzyme A (CoA) analogue. This enables the discovery of a previously unobserved route to benzoyl CoA. Reconstruction of the gene cluster in A. oryzae leads to the formation of prestrobilurin A, and addition of the gene str9 encoding an FAD-dependent oxygenase leads to the key oxidative rearrangement responsible for the creation of the \u03b2-methoxyacrylate toxophore. Finally, two methyltransferases are required to complete the synthesis.", "Strobilurins are fungal metabolites that inspired the creation of \u03b2-methoxyacrylate agricultural fungicides. Here, Nofiani et al. identify the strobilurin biosynthesis gene cluster, encoding a polyketide synthase as well as an FAD-dependent oxygenase for an oxidative rearrangement leading to \u03b2-methoxyacrylate formation.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Strobilurin A 11 and oudemansin A 22 (also known as mucidin) are antifungal polyketides produced by various Basidiomycete fungi (Fig.\u00a01a). The key \u03b2-methoxyacrylate toxophore targets the Qo site of complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and prevents adenosine triphosphate synthesis3. The major class of \u03b2-methoxyacrylate agricultural fungicides were developed from the structures of 1 and 2 with the aim of increasing photo-stability and selectivity. Thus, compounds such as azoxystrobin 3 (Syngenta) and Kresoxim methyl 4 (BASF) are among the most widely used fungicides worldwide. This class of antifungals are used as effective treatments against a broad range of destructive fungal plant pathogens and make significant contributions to food security4,5. The strobilurin fungicides are estimated to have been worth $3.4 billion in 2015 and they make up 25% of the fungicide market and 6.7% of the total crop protection market.

R.N. and Z.I. fermented the fungi and performed the natural product analysis. A.M.B., R.N. and K.d.M.-S. performed the genome and transcriptome sequence, analysis and interpretation. R.N., K.d.M.S. and K.E.L. performed the cloning and heterologous expression. R.N. and K.E.L. performed the compound isolation, analysis and structure elucidation. L.-C.H. performed all synthetic procedures. L.C.H., Z.I., R.N. and K.E.L. were supervised by R.J.C., T.J.S., C.L.W. and A.M.B.
