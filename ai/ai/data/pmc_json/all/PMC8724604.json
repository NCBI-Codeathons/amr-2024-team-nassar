["Epidemic diseases and antibiotic resistance are urgent threats to global health, and human is confronted with an unprecedented dilemma to conquer them by expediting development of new natural product related drugs. C-nucleoside antibiotics, a remarkable group of microbial natural products with diverse biological activities, feature a heterocycle base linked with a ribosyl moiety via an unusual C-glycosidic bond, and have played significant roles in healthcare and for plant protection. Elucidating how nature biosynthesizes such a group of antibiotics has provided the basis for engineered biosynthesis as well as targeted genome mining of more C-nucleoside antibiotics towards improved properties. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent advances on the biosynthesis of C-nucleoside antibiotics, and we also tentatively discuss the future developments on rationally accessing C-nucleoside diversities in a more efficient and economical way via synthetic biology strategies.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Nucleoside antibiotics play significant roles in mammalian healthcare and for plant protection against pathogen-induced infections [1], and they are usually synthesized by sequential modifications of nucleosides or nucleotides of primary origin to render the intricate molecules [2]. Nucleoside antibiotics, on the basis of the linkage by glycosidic bond, can be generally classified into two main categories, either N- or C-nucleosides. Normally, N-nucleosides are structurally unstable and susceptible to cleavage of the glycosidic bond with loss of bioactivity, which has raised considerable research interests in the past decades towards the development of C-nucleoside derived drugs [3]. Actually, nature, as a great chemist, has developed the great capability of creating the C-nucleosides prior to the synthesis of artificial molecules, and pseudouridine (\u03a8) is the first naturally-occurring C-nucleoside found abundantly in tRNA [4]. Since then, several C-nucleoside antibiotics have been successively isolated in the past decades.", "Nucleoside antibiotics play significant roles in mammalian healthcare and for plant protection against pathogen-induced infections [1], and they are usually synthesized by sequential modifications of nucleosides or nucleotides of primary origin to render the intricate molecules [2].

A strong candidate to be the MAL-A biosynthetic gene cluster, comprises 20 predicted open reading frames. The biosynthesis of MAL-A may utilize uridine as a starter substrate by pseudouridine synthase TruD to generate pseudouridine [10], which is susceptible to be phosphorylated to produce 5\u2032-pseudouridine monophosphate (5\u2032-\u03a8-MP). After that, 5\u2032-\u03a8-MP was catalyzed by MalO (enoylpyruvyl transferase) acting almost exclusively on 5\u2032-\u03a8-MP to yield compound 23. Then, the radical SAM enzyme MalJ is proposed to catalyze C\u2013C bond formation utilizing a previously-characterized strategy in nikkomycin/polyoxin biosynthesis to form compound 24, which is then catalyzed by enzymes containing phosphatase MalL, 2-oxoglutarate-Fe (II)-dependent oxygenases MalM and MalI, and aminotransferase MalK to build compound 26 [10]. After the final tailoring enzymatic steps by the carbamoyltransferase MalD and the O-methyltransferase MalF, biosynthesis of the end C-nucleoside molecule MAL-A is accomplished (Fig.\u00a06b) [10].Fig. 6The gene clusters and proposed pathway for MAL-A biosynthesis. a Organization of the MAL-A gene clusters (mal), which is independently identified from S. chromofuscus ATCC 49982 and S. malaysiensis DSM 14072. b The proposed biosynthetic pathway to MAL-A", "Fig. 6The gene clusters and proposed pathway for MAL-A biosynthesis. a Organization of the MAL-A gene clusters (mal), which is independently identified from S. chromofuscus ATCC 49982 and S. malaysiensis DSM 14072. b The proposed biosynthetic pathway to MAL-A", "Fig. 6The gene clusters and proposed pathway for MAL-A biosynthesis. a Organization of the MAL-A gene clusters (mal), which is independently identified from S. chromofuscus ATCC 49982 and S. malaysiensis DSM 14072. b The proposed biosynthetic pathway to MAL-A", "Fig. 6The gene clusters and proposed pathway for MAL-A biosynthesis. a Organization of the MAL-A gene clusters (mal), which is independently identified from S. chromofuscus ATCC 49982 and S. malaysiensis DSM 14072. b The proposed biosynthetic pathway to MAL-A", "The gene clusters and proposed pathway for MAL-A biosynthesis. a Organization of the MAL-A gene clusters (mal), which is independently identified from S. chromofuscus ATCC 49982 and S. malaysiensis DSM 14072. b The proposed biosynthetic pathway to MAL-A", "The gene clusters and proposed pathway for MAL-A biosynthesis. a Organization of the MAL-A gene clusters (mal), which is independently identified from S. chromofuscus ATCC 49982 and S. malaysiensis DSM 14072. b The proposed biosynthetic pathway to MAL-A", "The gene clusters and proposed pathway for MAL-A biosynthesis. a Organization of the MAL-A gene clusters (mal), which is independently identified from S. chromofuscus ATCC 49982 and S. malaysiensis DSM 14072. b The proposed biosynthetic pathway to MAL-A", "Biosynthesis of the bacterial RNA polymerase-pseudouridimycin", "Biosynthesis of the bacterial RNA polymerase-pseudouridimycin", "Biosynthesis of the bacterial RNA polymerase-pseudouridimycin", "In 2017, it has been reported the identification and complete characterization of pseudouridimycin (PUM), a new C-nucleoside antibiotic from Streptomyces sp.
