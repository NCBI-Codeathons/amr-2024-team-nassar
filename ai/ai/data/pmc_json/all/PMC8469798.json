["The pressing issue of the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and resistant bacteria in the environment (ARGs and ARB, respectively) requires procedures for assessing the risk to health. The chemo-centric environmental risk assessment models identify hazard(s) in a dose\u2013response manner, obtaining exposure, toxicity, risk, impact and policy. However, this risk assessment approach based on ARGs/ARB evaluation from a quantitative viewpoint shows high unpredictability because ARGs/ARB cannot be considered as standard hazardous molecules: ARB duplicate and ARGs evolve within a biological host. ARGs/ARB are currently listed as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CEC). In light of such characteristics, we propose to define ARGs/ARB within a new category of evolving CEC (or e-CEC). ARGs/ARB, like any other evolving determinants (e.g., viruses, bacteria, genes), escape environmental controls. When they do so, just one molecule left remaining at a control point can form the origin of a new dangerous and selection-responsive population. As a consequence, perhaps it is time to acknowledge this trait and to include evolutionary concepts within modern risk assessment of e-CEC. In this perspective we analyze the evolutionary responses most likely to influence risk assessment, and we speculate on the means by which current methods could measure evolution. Further work is required to implement and exploit such experimental procedures in future risk assessment protocols.", "1. Antibiotic Resistances as Contaminants of Emerging Concern", "1.

The final ratio is generally divided by the initial ratio and converted by using a logarithmic function. More complex calculations can also be generated according to the fitness strategy used, and according to the number of generations that have passed [39]. Lately, other strategies have been proposed to measure fitness. One strategy is based on reducing the fitness differential between the competitors by using a third common reference competitor [39]. Competition experiments in microcosms have been used to study the fitness of antibiotic resistance mutations in Escherichia coli in relation to environmental heterogeneity [59]. Another example showed how pollution influences the persistence of the multidrug resistant Shigella flexneri 2a YSH6000 strain in polluted river water samples [45]. In these examples the fitness was tested with microcosms using the water from the environment (river water). Yet another example is the measurement of the net selection of model strains for or against resistance in a multi-stress environment [38]. In a multi-stress environment, such as the real environment, aspects of its complexity may favor bacteria for their resistance or sensitivity to a particular antibiotic. Sublethal antibiotic concentration may also induce, or not, a specific resistance. A simple model of the growth of sensitive and resistant strains has been proposed by Chait and collaborators [38]. In this system a YFP (yellow fluorescent protein)-labelled tetracycline-sensitive and a CFP (cyan fluorescent protein)-labelled tetracycline-resistant E. coli are mixed and grown together over a diffusing toxin gradient in agar, in a complex environment either with or without a uniform concentration of a specific antibiotic [38]. This type of fitness experiment could provide rapid insight regarding a specific question, for example, if a sublethal antibiotic concentration still exerts selective pressure in a specific microcosm.", "The second approach, which represents the gold standard for fitness tests in laboratory settings, is based on the generation of microcosms and the use of labelled strains [41]. Strains can be labelled with a fluorescent protein-encoding gene, or simply carry the resistance gene and thus be compared with the control strain lacking the resistance gene. In addition, pairs of mutations in the same resistance genes can be used to compare which mutation is less costly in terms of fitness. With this approach, the strains are incubated in a specific microcosm, replicating the environmental conditions of interest, and then the relative amounts of both genotypes are determined in terms of cells units, CFU/mL, or via cytofluorimetry.

The fitness effects of plasmids are pivotal because of their ability to undergo horizontal gene transfer, mainly through conjugation, between bacterial hosts and to accelerate the evolution of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance [62]. Other mobile genetic elements, such as transposons and integrons, also play a central role in facilitating horizontal genetic exchange and therefore promote the acquisition and spread of resistance genes [63].

It is clear that for the scope of risk assessment the identification of IS and Tn associated with ARGs could be very helpful in evaluating the ability of a certain ARG to spread in the environment. In this context the use of untargeted metagenome sequencing can provide an approach to identify the presence of specific IS or Tn.
