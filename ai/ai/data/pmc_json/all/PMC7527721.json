["This study revealed a novel, potentially conserved mechanism involved in the biosynthesis of microbial natural products, exemplified by the mitochondrial active depsipeptide cereulide. Similar to other bioactive substances, such as the last-resort antibiotics vancomycin and daptomycin, the antitumor drug cryptophycin or the cholesterol-lowering agent lovastatin, cereulide is synthesized nonribosomally by multienzyme machinery, requiring the concerted actions of multiple proteins to ensure correct product assembly. Given the importance of microbial secondary metabolites in human and veterinary medicine, it is critical to understand how these processes are orchestrated within the host cells. By revealing that tethering of a biosynthetic enzyme to the cell membrane by an ABC transporter is essential for nonribosomal peptide production, our study provides novel insights into synthesis of microbial secondary metabolites, which could contribute to isolation of novel compounds from cryptic secondary metabolite clusters or improve the yield of produced pharmaceuticals.", "ABSTRACT", "Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthetases (PKSs) play a pivotal role in the production of bioactive natural products, such as antibiotics and cytotoxins. Despite biomedical and pharmaceutical importance, the molecular mechanisms and architectures of these multimodular enzyme complexes are not fully understood. Here, we report on an ABC transporter that forms a vital part of the nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic machinery. Emetic Bacillus cereus produces the highly potent, mitochondrial active nonribosomal depsipeptide cereulide, synthesized by the NRPS Ces. The ces gene locus includes, next to the structural cesAB genes, a putative ABC transporter, designated cesCD. Our study demonstrates that tethering of CesAB synthetase to the cell membrane by CesCD is critical for peptide assembly. In vivo studies revealed that CesAB colocalizes with CesCD on the cell membrane, suggesting direct involvement of this ABC transporter in the biosynthesis of a nonribosomal peptide. Mutation of cesCD, disrupting the assembly of the CesCD complex, resulted in decreased interaction with CesAB and, as a consequence, negatively affected cereulide biosynthesis. Specific domains within CesAB synthetase interacting with CesC were identified. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the structurally similar BerAB transporter from Bacillus thuringiensis complements CesCD function in cereulide biosynthesis, suggesting that the direct involvement of ABC transporter in secondary metabolite biosynthesis could be a widespread mechanism. In summary, our study revealed a novel, noncanonical function for ABC transporter, which is essential for megaenzyme functionality of NRPS. The new insights into natural product biosynthesis gained may facilitate the discovery of new metabolites with bioactive potential.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multimodular bacterial and fungal megaenzymes responsible for the synthesis of various bioactive natural compounds, such as antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and vancomycin), antitumor drugs (e.g., bleomycins and cryptophycins), immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine), siderophores (e.g., enterobactin), and toxins (e.g., microcystins and cereulide) (1\u20135). Thus, it is of utmost importance to understand the mechanism of biosynthesis of these in vivo enzymatic machineries, which are organized in modules. Each NRPS module, responsible for recognition, activation, and the condensation of selected monomers, comprise at least an adenylation domain, a peptidyl carrier protein domain, and a condensation domain (A, PCP, and C domains, respectively) (6, 7). A domains act as selective \u201cgatekeepers\u201d recognizing and activating the precursors of the growing peptide, while PCP domains interact with A domains to form thioester intermediates and function as a peptide shuttle, transferring the intermediates between the A and C domains (8). The latter domains catalyze peptide bond formation between two substrates from the adjacent modules. In addition to these essential domains, NRPSs can harbor further domains, such as epimerases, methylases, and ketoreductases (E, M, and KR domains), increasing the biodiversity of peptide products (7). The last module of many NRPSs contains a terminal thioesterase (TE) domain, which catalyzes the release of the final product (9). Although considerable progress has been made in deciphering the structure and function of NRPS domains, it remains elusive how these large, highly dynamic and flexible multienzyme machineries are stabilized and organized in host cells to orchestrate NRPS domains and ensure correct product synthesis.", "Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multimodular bacterial and fungal megaenzymes responsible for the synthesis of various bioactive natural compounds, such as antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and vancomycin), antitumor drugs (e.g., bleomycins and cryptophycins), immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine), siderophores (e.g., enterobactin), and toxins (e.g., microcystins and cereulide) (1\u20135).

ABC transporters are a superfamily of proteins found in all kingdoms of life that are characterized by conserved structures, typically consisting of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) involved in substrate and ATP binding, respectively (11).

Various enterotoxins have been linked to the diarrheal form of the illness, while the emetic form of the illness is caused by depsipeptide toxin cereulide (16, 17). In contrast to the ribosomally encoded enterotoxins that are broadly distributed among the members of the B. cereus group, the potential for the production of the nonribosomally assembled depsipeptide cereulide is restricted to genetically closely related B. cereus strains (18, 19). In emetic Bacillus cereus a putative ABC transporter has been identified that is part of the genetic locus encoding the cereulide (Ces) NRPS responsible for the assembly of the highly bioactive and potent mitochondrial toxin cereulide (20). Ingestion of food contaminated with cereulide provokes emesis and occasionally leads to rhabdomyolysis, liver damage, and serious multiorgan failure, resulting in occasional fatalities (21\u201324). The cereulide synthetase ces genes are organized in an operon localized on the pCER270 virulence megaplasmid, which shares its backbone with the Bacillus anthracis toxin plasmid pX01 (20, 25).

As shown previously, expression of the cesPTABCD genes, which are polycistronically transcribed by a central promoter upstream of cesP (26), is a tightly regulated process that involves different realms of regulation (26\u201330).

The biosynthesis of cereulide, just as for other nonribosomal peptides, is a multistep, energy-consuming process. Since cereulide is an ionophore leading to membrane depolarization (41, 42), it is tempting to speculate that it would be beneficial for the producing cells to simultaneously orchestrate both the biosynthesis and the export of this metabolite. Subcellular compartmentalization of the metabolic enzymes involved in the primary metabolic processes, such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, or fatty acid synthesis, is a widespread and highly regulated process (43). In contrast, only a few examples of subcellular compartmentalization in secondary metabolism have been documented. An organelle-like, membrane-associated megacomplex of NRPS/PKS hybrid was described for B. subtilis (44). Furthermore, the temporal membrane localization of the siderophore pyoverdine NRPS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported in the context of efficient transport of the precursors and the release of the final product to the secretion apparatus (35). As revealed by our study, the ATPase CesC of the ABC transporter CesCD, which is cotranscribed with the structural cereulide synthetase genes cesAB (26), specifically interacts with the condensation domains of CesAB. We did not detect any interaction between CesC and the A domains or TE domain of CesB. Since A domains are the catalytical core of each NRPS module responsible for amino, hydroxy, and carboxy acid recognition and activation (3, 45), one could speculate, a priori, that a binding pocket will, in order to remain exposed to its substrates, not easily interact in trans. In contrast, C domains have been recognized as quite flexible NRPS domains, which can adopt several conformations (46, 47). This observation is fostered by our results, suggesting that the interactions of C domains with CesC, the catalytic part of the ABC transporter, permit CesAB to adopt the optimal conformation for efficient cereulide synthesis. We further demonstrated that CesA_C* colocalizes with CesCD at the cell membrane, while CesA_C* was found to be delocalized and distributed throughout the cytosol in cells not expressing a functional CesCD ABC transporter. As inactivation of either cesC or cesD led to loss of cereulide production (31), it is tempting to speculate that roping of the cereulide biosynthetic machinery to the cell membrane via CesCD is crucial for cereulide biosynthesis.", "Our data convincingly show that an ABC transporter adjacent to a nonribosomal peptide synthetase plays a crucial and direct role in the biosynthesis of a natural product, beyond its canonical transport function. The biosynthesis of cereulide, just as for other nonribosomal peptides, is a multistep, energy-consuming process. Since cereulide is an ionophore leading to membrane depolarization (41, 42), it is tempting to speculate that it would be beneficial for the producing cells to simultaneously orchestrate both the biosynthesis and the export of this metabolite. Subcellular compartmentalization of the metabolic enzymes involved in the primary metabolic processes, such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, or fatty acid synthesis, is a widespread and highly regulated process (43).

First, nucleotide binding domains (NDBs) undergo dimerization due to the binding of ATP and the substrate. In the second step, ATP is hydrolyzed and the substrate is translocated across the membrane. However, under certain circumstances, ATP binding alone leads to the conformational changes of the transporter to facilitate substrate allocation. In the latter case, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release reset the transporter to the original conformation (48, 49). The NBDs have highly conserved amino acid sequences, such as the Walker A motif (GXXGXGKS/T) (lysine in bold) (11), which is also conserved in CesC (Fig.\u00a01B). Within the Walker A motif, the conserved amino acids lysine and glycine have been reported to play a pivotal role for the functionality of the transporter by binding to ATP (50, 51). As revealed by our current work, the Walker A motif in CesC is essential not only for correct CesCD oligomerization but also for the interaction of CesC and CesA_C*, suggesting that it plays an additional role in the NRPS assembly line of cereulide beyond its canonical function. The change of a conserved lysine to methionine (K40M) in the Walker A motif of CesC also influenced the interaction of CesC and CesA_C* and consequently ceased cereulide biosynthesis. In contrast, the cereulide biosynthesis level was only partially affected in the F48\u0394cesCDcesCD_V29T/F30Y mutant.

Furthermore, these amino acids have not yet been described to play an essential role for the functionality of ABC transporters. It could be speculated that the exchange of V29T/F30Y affects the exact position of Walker A within the structure of the ABC transporter, thereby hindering its functionality.
