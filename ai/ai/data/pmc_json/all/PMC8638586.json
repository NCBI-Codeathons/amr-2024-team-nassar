Disk diffusion assays using spent medium demonstrated that all bacteria produced bactericidal compounds against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923.", "ANNOUNCEMENT", "ANNOUNCEMENT", "Three bacteria belonging to the genera Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Deinococcus were isolated for their antimicrobial-producing properties. Enterobacter species are generally considered human pathogens, but some strains have been shown to possess antibacterial (1\u20133) and antifungal (4) activities. Pseudomonas species also produce antibacterial (5\u20139) and antifungal compounds (10, 11); their genomes have been mined for the ability to synthesize secondary metabolites and drug-like natural products (12), and P. putida produces a number of natural product families (13). Deinococcus radiodurans produces an antioxidant exopolysaccharide, while a Deinococcus strain isolated from ants produces cancer-preventing aminoglycolipids (14).", "Three bacteria belonging to the genera Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Deinococcus were isolated for their antimicrobial-producing properties.
