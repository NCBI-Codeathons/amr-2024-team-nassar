["Abstract", "Antimicrobial resistance is a major obstacle for the treatment of infectious diseases and currently represents one of the most significant threats to global health. Staphylococcus aureus remains a formidable human pathogen with high mortality rates associated with severe systemic infections. S. aureus has become notorious as a multidrug resistant bacterium, which when combined with its extensive arsenal of virulence factors that exacerbate disease, culminates in an incredibly challenging pathogen to treat clinically. Compounding this major health issue is the lack of antibiotic discovery and development, with only two new classes of antibiotics approved for clinical use in the last 20\u2009years. Combined efforts from the scientific community have reacted to the threat of dwindling treatment options to combat S. aureus disease in several innovative and exciting developments. This review describes current and future antimicrobial strategies aimed at treating staphylococcal colonization and/or disease, examining therapies that show significant promise at the preclinical development stage to approaches that are currently being investigated in clinical trials.", "Summary of novel strategies currently being developed to treat multi\u2010drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.", "Douglas, E.J.A.\n, \nWulandari, S.W.\n, \nLovell, S.D.\n & \nLaabei, M.\n (2023) Novel antimicrobial strategies to treat multi\u2010drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.

These Janus\u2010faced bacteria (Broker et al.,\u00a02014) have evolved the capacity to inhabit the mammalian host asymptomatically while retaining the ability to transmit successfully in both healthcare and community environments and cause severe, often life\u2010threatening infections. S. aureus is well adapted to the human host and resides within the moist squamous epithelium of the anterior nares in 20\u201340% of the general population (Peacock et al.,\u00a02001). Following breach of cutaneous and/or mucosal barriers, S. aureus may gain access to the bloodstream or a underlying tissue, resulting in infection. Immunocompromised patients, persons with indwelling medical devices and people who are colonized by S. aureus, are at greatest risk to infection (Lowy,\u00a01998; von Eiff et al.,\u00a02001).", "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram\u2010positive, coagulase\u2010positive, non\u2010spore forming and non\u2010motile coccoid bacterium.

Lugdunin is thought to cause membrane disruption through an unknown mechanism of action.", "Structure and mechanism of action of new naturally occurring antibiotics. Cell wall synthesis begins with the formation of UDP\u2010MurNAc action through the action of MurA and MurB. The pentapeptide is subsequently added to UDP\u2010MurNAc acid by the enzymes MurC\u2010F to form the phosphor\u2010MurNAc\u2010pentapeptide. This is ligated to the lipid carrier undecaprenyl\u2010diphosphate by MraY to form the lipid I precursor. The addition of UDP\u2010GlcNAc by MurG finally results in the formation of lipid II. FemX then adds the first glycyl unit, FemA the second and third, and FemB the fourth and fifth to complete the addition of the pentaglycine cross bridge. Final structural modification of lipid II, such as deamination of D\u2010Glu on the stem peptide, is performed by MurT and GatD. The completed lipid II molecule is subsequently flipped to the outer membrane through the action of MurJ/SAV1754 which is blocked by the action of humimycin A and humimycin B. The final stage of cell wall synthesis is carried out by penicillin\u2010binding proteins (PBPs), which incorporate lipid II into the growing peptidoglycan sacculus through transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions. This is prevented through the action of malacidin A and teixobactin which bind to extracellular lipid II and prevent PBP binding. As peptidoglycan matures it undergoes structural reconfiguration through the action of autolysins. The binding of complestatin and corbomycin to conserved peptidoglycan residues prevents the binding of autolysins thus inhibiting cell wall turnover. After the addition of lipid II into the cell wall, undecaprenyl diphosphate is recycled to undecaprenyl phosphate by UppP and used as a precursor for wall teichoic synthesis. TarO and TarA catalyse the formation of the disaccharide linker which is conjugated to undecaprenyl diphosphate. Next two glycerol phosphate residues are added by TarB which sets the stage for teichoic acid polymerization. Repeating subunits of ribitol phosphate are added by TarF and TarL. The completed teichoic acid is flipped to the outer membrane by TarGH and incorporated in the cell wall by the teichoic ligase LcpA. Importantly, teixobactin has been shown to bind to multiple cell wall and teichoic acid precursors including lipid III and undecaprenyl diphosphate and lipid I.

While MurJ is essential in many species of bacteria, limited studies have investigated its potential as an antibacterial agent. However, a small molecule screen for molecules that could reverse \u03b2\u2010lactam resistance, identified synthetic inhibitors of SAV1754 (Huber et al.,\u00a02009; Lee et al.,\u00a02016). Humimycin A was subsequently evaluated for \u03b2\u2010lactam potentiation and was found to reduce the dicloxacillin MIC from 256\u2009\u03bcg/mL (resistant) to 8\u2009\u03bcg/mL (sensitive) in the presence of 4\u2009\u03bcg/mL humimycin A. Further investigation of this combination in a mouse peritonitis sepsis model found that treatment with dicloxacillin/humimycin A significantly improved the survival rate compared with treatment of dicloxacillin or humimycin A alone (Chu et al.,\u00a02016).", "The human microbiome has further proved to be an invaluable, untapped resource of antimicrobials through the discovery of humimycins. Genomes of human commensal and pathogenic bacteria were screened for the presence of gene clusters that encoded large non\u2010ribosomal peptides (NRPs). This led to the discovery of 57 unique putative non\u2010ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS). Subsequent screening of the peptide products against various commensal and pathogenic species for antibacterial activity found two antibiotics, playfully named humimycin A and humimycin B after h\numan microbiome mycin, from Rhodococcus spp. (Figure\u00a02). Both humimycins were found to have broad activity against Firmicutes and some limited activity against Actinobacteria. The most impressive potency was found when tested against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae with MICs of 8\u2009\u03bcg/mL and 4\u2009\u03bcg/mL respectively. When tested against a panel of S. aureus clinical isolates, MICs of 8\u2013128\u2009\u03bcg/mL were reported. In an effort to elucidate the biochemical mode of action, S. aureus USA300 mutants were selected that could grow in the presence of 2.5\u00d7 the MIC. Pairwise bioinformatic analysis of 23 resistant strains found that they all contained a non\u2010synonymous mutation in the essential gene SAV1754 (SAUPAN004432000 pangenome locus tag). Of these 23 resistant mutants, 15 contained no other mutations. To investigate the involvement of SAV1754 in the resistance to humimycins, overexpression studies were performed. Overexpression of SAV1754 conferred elevated MICs against humimycin A of >128\u2009\u03bcg/mL, confirming its involvement (Chu et al.,\u00a02016). SAV1754 is believed to encode a homologue of the MurJ lipid II flippase.
