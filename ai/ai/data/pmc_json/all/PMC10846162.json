["A.R. is a scientific consultant for LifeMine Therapeutics, Inc.", "ABSTRACT", "Fungal secondary metabolites (SMs) contribute to the diversity of fungal ecological communities, niches, and lifestyles. Many fungal SMs have one or more medically and industrially important activities (e.g., antifungal, antibacterial, and antitumor). The genes necessary for fungal SM biosynthesis are typically located right next to each other in the genome and are known as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, whether fungal SM bioactivity can be predicted from specific attributes of genes in BGCs remains an open question. We adapted machine learning models that predicted SM bioactivity from bacterial BGC data with accuracies as high as 80% to fungal BGC data. We trained our models to predict the antibacterial, antifungal, and cytotoxic/antitumor bioactivity of fungal SMs on two data sets: (i) fungal BGCs (data set comprised of 314 BGCs) and (ii) fungal (314 BGCs) and bacterial BGCs (1,003 BGCs). We found that models trained on fungal BGCs had balanced accuracies between 51% and 68%, whereas training on bacterial and fungal BGCs had balanced accuracies between 56% and 68%. The low prediction accuracy of fungal SM bioactivities likely stems from the small size of the data set; this lack of data, coupled with our finding that including bacterial BGC data in the training data did not substantially change accuracies currently limits the application of machine learning approaches to fungal SM studies. With >15,000 characterized fungal SMs, millions of putative BGCs in fungal genomes, and increased demand for novel drugs, efforts that systematically link fungal SM bioactivity to BGCs are urgently needed.", "IMPORTANCE", "IMPORTANCE", "Fungi are key sources of natural products and iconic drugs, including penicillin and statins.

SMs are small biologically active compounds that aid in adapting to different environments but are not required for normal function or survival (1). Many clades across the fungal kingdom produce SMs, including many that belong to the Pezizomycotina subphylum of filamentous fungi. These SMs have diverse bioactivities, including antifungals (2), UV protectants (3), antibacterials (4\u20136), iron sequesterers (7), antifeedants (8), immunosuppressants (9), and toxins (10). In addition to their ecological importance, fungal SMs are also of considerable interest to medicine, industry, and the bioeconomy and are used in a wide range of applications. It has been suggested that fungal SM chemical properties are more \u201cdrug-like\u201d compared to their bacterial counterparts by US Food and Drug Administration guidelines and oral bioavailability prognostic rules (11, 12). Many SMs such as penicillin (13), an antibiotic, and lovastatin (14), a cholesterol-lowering antifungal, are iconic drugs. Other SMs have been utilized in the food science, agricultural, and cosmetic industries for bioactivities such as antibiotics, pigments, and antifeedants.", "Fungi have captivated the scientific community for centuries due to their diverse ecological roles and remarkable ability to produce an array of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs).

There are a variety of core genes, such as polyketide synthases (PKS), terpene synthases, and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) (16).

Due to the increased demand for novel drugs, efforts that systematically link fungal SM bioactivity to BGCs are urgently needed. Various methods of correlating SMs to their corresponding BGCs have been undertaken such as targeted genome mining, heterologous expression, metabologenomics with gene cluster family (GCF) networking and correlation-based scoring (47), and feature-based correlation methods utilizing genome-metabolome ontologies in bacterial species (48). While these methods are continuing to improve, SM discovery is still far ahead of the characterization of the BGCs responsible for their biosynthesis. Although there are various databases available for characterized SMs, such as the Dictionary of Natural Products and Medicinal Fungi Secondary metabolites And Therapeutics (MeFSAT) (49), there remain potentially millions of uncharacterized BGC-SM pairs. Publishing the results of SM bioactivity assays in repositories, including the negative results, would be another systematic effort that could enable larger analyses and greater accessibility to these data.

Here, we obtained low balanced accuracies for models trained on fungal BGCs (51%\u201368%), likely because only 314 fungal BGCs were used to train our models. Additionally, while the BGC-SM pairs within MIBiG are experimentally validated, not all genes in each BGC have been experimentally validated. The lack of validation of each BGC is a limitation to this study as the input for model training is BGC data and relies on the genes within the BGCs to make informed predictions on bioactivity. There are BGCs that modify existing compounds, rather than de novo assembling the entire SM, increasing the complexity of predicting SM bioactivity from BGC data.", "Machine learning methods that predict fungal SM bioactivity from BGC data show promise but are currently unable to perform with high accuracy due to the lack of fungal BGC-SM pairs with bioactivity data.

Due to the dearth of data on fungal BGC-SM pairs and the lack of informativeness of bacterial data for predicting fungal SM bioactivity, our models exhibited relatively low balanced accuracies. Further model optimization for predicting fungal SM bioactivity will require a larger data set of fungal BGC-SM pairs. Additionally, breaking down the large, generalized bioactivity types (antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic/antitumor) into more specific classes incorporating the target or mode of action in addition to chemical structure features may aid in more specificity and better accuracies in predicting the bioactivity (although even larger numbers of BGC-SM pairs may be required).
