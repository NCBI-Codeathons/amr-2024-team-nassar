["Lipid droplets (LDs) act as intracellular storage organelles in most types of cells and are principally involved in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. However, the role of LDs in resistance to toxins in fungi remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the trapping of endogenous toxins by LDs is a self-resistance mechanism in the toxin producer, while absorbing external lipophilic toxins is a resistance mechanism in the toxin recipient that acts to quench the production of reactive oxygen species. We found that an endolichenic fungus that generates phototoxic perylenequinones (PQs) trapped the PQs inside LDs. Using a model that incorporates the fungicidal action of hypocrellin A (HA), a PQ derivative, we showed that yeast cells escaped killing by trapping toxins inside LDs. Furthermore, LD-deficient mutants were hypersusceptible to HA-mediated phototoxins and other fungicides. Our study identified a previously unrecognised function of LDs in fungi that has implications for our understanding of environmental adaptation strategies for fungi and antifungal drug discovery.", "Microorganisms have evolved diverse strategies to adapt to various environmental stresses123. Self-resistance in a toxin-producing organism and toxin-resistance in the recipients are some of the most important adaptive abilities. The emergence of resistance to endogenous or extracellular toxins results via one or a combination of the following mechanisms: (i) intracellular modification or degradation of toxins456789, (ii) target mutation1011, and (iii) removal of the toxins by efficient efflux pumps12. Numerous studies have shown that subcellular organelles are also involved in resistance to oxidative stress and intracellular toxins. For example, chloroplasts, mitochondria and peroxisomes, the major generators of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), harbour antioxidant defence systems that confer resistance to endogenous oxidative stress8. Lysosomes in mammalian cells and vacuoles in yeast are known to degrade molecules, such as nutrients or metabolites, that have essential functions at physiological concentrations but that become toxic in excess131415.", "Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic intracellular organelles that contain neutral lipids, including triacylglycerols (TAGs) and sterol esters (SEs), as their main constituents. These are surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer and specific proteins, and they are ubiquitously present in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells1617. LDs have been assumed to be inert fat particles used to store carbon and energy since they were first recognised in the 19th century181920. Recent evidence has shown that LDs participate in multiple cellular functions, such as membrane trafficking, phospholipid recycling, intracellular protein metabolism and cell signalling202122. Macrophages utilise LDs to store esterified cholesterol when excess endogenous cholesterol causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress23. In response to starvation, autophagosomes can mediate the delivery of LD content into lysosomes for degradation24. Notwithstanding the important cellular functions of LDs, little is known about the involvement of LD-mediated resistance in environmental adaptation.", "Here, we show that phototoxic perylenequinones (PQs), which are biosynthesised by the endolichenic fungus Phaeosphaeria sp., are taken up into LDs following exposure to light irradiation. This confers resistance in the producer to these phototoxins. Using a PQ derivative, hypocrellin A (HA), as a molecular probe, we found that trapping HA inside LDs resulted in reduced phototoxicity against both the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans and the yeast model Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which suggests a function for this exquisite organelle in drug resistance. In addition, mutants deficient in LDs were found to be more hypersusceptible to HA-mediated phototoxins and other fungicidal agents. We believe that this LD-mediated resistance mechanism may provide valuable insights into how self-resistance to endogenous toxins is conferred to toxin producers and how resistance to external toxins occurs in other recipients.", "Results", "Results", "Trapping phototoxins in LDs serves as a resistance mechanism in an endolichenic fungus", "Trapping phototoxins in LDs serves as a resistance mechanism in an endolichenic fungus", "Trapping phototoxins in LDs serves as a resistance mechanism in an endolichenic fungus", "Our previous investigation of an endolichenic fungus, Phaeosphaeria sp., from the lichen Heterodermia obscurata (Nyl.)

By examining the intracellular fluorescence distribution of dansyl-labelled amphotericin B (AmB-Ds)39, we found that AmB-Ds was bound to the cytoplasmic membrane and spread throughout the cytoplasm of dead cells rather than localising to specific LDs in C. albicans (Supplementary Fig. 11), in accordance with a previous report showing that AmB aggregates in the cell membrane and extracts ergosterol from the lipid bilayers40. This suggested that LDs had a smaller effect on the trapping of most of these clinically used antifungal agents. However, AmB or Mic treatment stimulated an increase in the number and size of LDs in C. albicans (Supplementary Fig. 12A). A similar result was obtained when farnesol was studied, whereas no significant effects were observed following Ter, CAS or FLC treatments (Supplementary Fig. 12B). These results suggest that the increased size or number of LDs was a stress response to treatment with antifungal agents, although the cells with large LDs did not escape death (Supplementary Fig. 12C). This is consistent with a previous finding that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducers, such as tunicamycin and brefeldin A, stimulate LD formation in S. cerevisiae but do not guarantee cell survival during ER stress41.", "Taking into consideration the central roles of LDs in self-resistance to endotoxins and drug resistance to extracellular toxins, we were interested in assessing the impact of yeast LDs on other antibiotics. The susceptibility of C. albicans cells cultured in YPD or YPDO medium to clinically-used antifungal agents36 and the quorum sensing molecule farnesol3738 was tested. We found that the growth inhibition caused by fluconazole (FLC), terbinafine (Ter), caspofungin (CAS), amphotericin B (AmB) and miconazole (Mic) was not significantly different in the cells cultured in the above two culture media (Supplementary Fig. 10A, B). By contrast, C. albicans cells with large LDs were resistant to farnesol compared with cells with small LDs, possibly due to differences in intracellular distribution (Supplementary Fig. 10C).

However, no significant differences were observed between dga2\u0394/dga2\u0394 and BWP17 in their responses to other drugs (Supplementary Fig. 13).

Starting with an investigation of self-resistance mechanisms in an endolichenic fungus, Phaeosphaeria sp., that biosynthesizes phototoxic PQs, we found that the toxins were trapped inside LDs in the producer cells (Fig. 1G). The toxicity of PQs results from ROS formation, particularly singlet oxygen production, following exposure to light. When HA, a PQ derivative, was dissolved in lipophilic solvents that contained triglycerides, fewer singlet oxygen molecules were generated by light irradiation (Fig. 1I), suggesting that trapping PQs into LDs conferred resistance to endogenous phototoxins.

The reduced phototoxic effect of HA in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae can be attributed to the ability of LDs to trap toxins, and yeast with larger LDs may trap more toxins, thus conferring increased resistance to HA-mediated phototoxicity or to the lipophilic agent farnesol. The trapped toxins in LDs lose the ability to induce the production of ROS, resulting in the increased survival of the fungi (Figs 2E and 4). This is different from what occurs in organelles such as chloroplasts, mitochondria and peroxisomes that employ antioxidant defence systems to protect against ROS8. Our findings demonstrate that LDs could be a novel strategy for relieving oxidative stress via trapping of toxins.

The present findings contribute to our understanding of how LD-mediated trapping leads to the inactivation of the ROS production that generally occurs in response to lipophilic toxins.

This was probably owing to the polarity of tested antibiotics, which prevents them from dissolving mutually with LDs or to the specificity of their targets outside LDs, as exemplified by the fact that AmB-Ds primarily bind to the cytoplasmic membrane rather than being taken up into LDs (Supplementary Fig. 11). However, the increases in LD size and number observed in C. albicans cells that were stimulated by AmB or Mic treatment suggested that the generation of neutral lipids is a stress response. Disruption of DAG2 caused the loss of the ability to form LDs and rendered C. albicans more susceptible to AmB, Mic and farnesol treatment (Supplementary Fig. 13).
