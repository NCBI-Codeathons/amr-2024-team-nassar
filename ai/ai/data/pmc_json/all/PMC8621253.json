["The bioinsecticidal action of Pseudomonas protegens has so far been reported against some target insects, and the mode of action remains unclear. In this study, the pathogenicity potential of a recently isolated strain of this bacterial species against fly larvae of medical and veterinary interest was determined. Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the biocidal action by ingestion against Musca domestica and Lucilia caesar larvae, which highlighted a concentration-dependent effect, with LC50 values of 3.6 and 2.5 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL, respectively. Bacterial septicaemia was observed in the body of insects assuming bacterial cells by ingestion. Such rapid bacterial reproduction in the hemolymph supports a toxin-mediated mechanism of action involving the intestinal barrier overcoming. In order to gain more information on the interaction with the host, the relative time-course expression of selected P. protegens genes associated with virulence and pathogenicity, was determined by qPCR at the gut level during the first infection stage. Among target genes, chitinase D was the most expressed, followed by pesticin and the fluorescent insecticidal toxin fitD. According to our observations and to the diversity of metabolites P. protegens produces, the pathogenic interaction this bacterium can establish with different targets appears to be complex and multifactorial.", "Key Contribution", "A new strain of Pseudomonas protegens is toxic to Musca domestica and Lucilia caesar. Specific bacterial target genes have been associated with entomopathogenicity and septicaemia.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Pseudomonas protegens is a soil-dwelling bacterium characterized by an increasing scientific and industrial interest as a growth promoting agent for cultivated plants [1]. Like other pseudomonad species, this bacterium is able to colonize the rhizosphere favoring biochemical mechanisms increasing the availability of soil nutrients to the plant. In addition, pseudomonads can act indirectly (plant resistance induction) and directly (i.e., antibiosis) against phytopathogens [2]. The direct action against plant pathogens relies on the production of diverse compounds such as 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), orfamide A, pyoluteorin, pyrrolnitrin, rhizoxin derivatives, toxoflavin, and several enzymes [3]. While some of these metabolites may also have a toxic or inhibitory action against insect pests affecting crops, several Pseudomonas species have developed particular toxins and virulence factors to act more specifically against insects. One of the most studied members of this bacterial genus is P. entomophila that acts by ingestion against susceptible targets leveraging a specific toxin secretion system [4]. Similarly, diverse species in the P. fluorescens group may act as insect pathogens [5]. However, those belonging to the sub-clade 1, including P. protegens, seems to have developed specific gene traits associated with the insecticidal properties [6]. Recent studies have documented an oral infection process implying a fluorescent insecticidal toxin (Fit) complex showing similarity with the makes caterpillars floppy (Mcf) toxin found in the entomopathogenic nematode symbiont Photorhabdus luminescens [7]. However, P. protegens mutants lacking the functionality of the gene complex fit were observed to be still active against fruit flies, thus supporting the involvement of other insecticidal compounds [8]. In the light of the few studies available, the mechanism of action of P. protegens on susceptible insects still appears to be poorly understood. In order to increase understanding of P. protegens target range and entomopathogenic mode of action, we conducted bioassays on different muscoid fly larvae investigating the possible involvement of genes encoding for some putative protein toxins and virulence factors. For this purpose, gene expression profile was studied at the transcriptional level after oral administration of a new strain of the bacterium. Because target genes are in common between different P. protegens strains, the output of this study is useful to deepen the knowledge also of other strains of this species.", "Pseudomonas protegens is a soil-dwelling bacterium characterized by an increasing scientific and industrial interest as a growth promoting agent for cultivated plants [1].
