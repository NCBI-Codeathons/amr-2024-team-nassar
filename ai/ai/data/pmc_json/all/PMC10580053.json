["Handling Editor: Young-Su Seo", "Crop productivity can be obstructed by various biotic and abiotic stresses and thus these stresses are a threat to universal food security. The information on the use of viruses providing efficacy to plants facing growth challenges owing to stress is lacking. The role of induction of pathogen-related genes by microbes is also colossal in drought-endurance acquisition. Studies put forward the importance of viruses as sustainable means for defending plants against dual stress. A fundamental part of research focuses on a positive interplay between viruses and plants. Notably, the tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) possess the capacity to safeguard tomato host plants against severe drought conditions. This study aims to explore the combined effects of TYLCV, ToCV, and drought stress on two tomato cultivars, Money Maker (MK, UK) and Shalala (SH, Azerbaijan). The expression of pathogen-related four cellulose synthase gene families (CesA/Csl) which have been implicated in drought and virus resistance based on gene expression analysis, was assessed using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method. The molecular tests revealed significant upregulation of Ces-A2, Csl-D3,2, and Csl-D3,1 genes in TYLCV and ToCV-infected tomato plants. CesA/Csl genes, responsible for biosynthesis within the MK and SH tomato cultivars, play a role in defending against TYLCV and ToCV. Additionally, physiological parameters such as \u201crelative water content,\u201d \u201cspecific leaf weight,\u201d \u201cleaf area,\u201d and \u201cdry biomass\u201d were measured in dual-stressed tomatoes. Using these features, it might be possible to cultivate TYLCV-resistant plants during seasons characterized by water scarcity.", "Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is a highly economically valuable crop worldwide, with a production of 180.8 million tons in 2019 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2020). Viral diseases are significant inhibitors of tomato production, causing yield losses (Han\u010dinsk\u00fd et al., 2020; Ong et al., 2020). A comprehensive analysis of databases and literature revealed at least 312 viruses, satellite viruses, or viroid species associated with tomatoes, representing 22 families and 39 genera, which is a record number for any plant species. The financial losses caused by viral infections in tomato crops are challenging to estimate, but yield losses range from approximately 30 to 50 billion US dollars per year (Rivarez et al., 2021). Biotic and abiotic stress factors have a detrimental impact on global agricultural production. DNA and RNA viruses that infect tomato plants are particularly significant biotic stress factors affecting productivity. Whitefly-transmitted virus diseases, including tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), are the main pathogens causing infections in tomato plants (Fiallo-Oliv\u00e9 and Navas-Castillo, 2019). TYLCV is a single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Geminiviridae family in the Begomovirus genus, known for its negative impact on tomato plant production in tropical and subtropical regions (Czosnek, 2021; Desbiez et al., 2019; Verdin et al., 2018). TYLCV has a circular 2800 nucleotide single-stranded DNA genome encapsulated in a structure measuring 25 \u00d7 30 nm. Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) is another pathogen affecting tomato plants, belonging to the Closteriviridae genus of the Crinivirus species. It is a single-stranded RNA genome virus causing characteristic symptoms of interveinal chlorosis in the lower leaves and chlorotic spots in the apical part of the plant (Orfanidou et al., 2016). ToCV is a phloem-limited virus with a positive-sense single-stranded bipartite RNA genome. Insect vectors, particularly Bemisia tabaci, play a crucial role in transmitting both ToCV and TYLCV viruses (Macedo et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019).", "Drought, exacerbated by global warming, poses a significant threat to many countries (Fullana-Peric\u00e0s et al., 2018; Lesk et al., 2016). Rational utilization of natural water resources is becoming a global challenge (Yan and Wang, 2013). Tomato production is severely affected by abiotic stresses, leading to yield losses of approximately 70% depending on the severity and duration of the stress. Drought is recognized as the most detrimental abiotic stress, rendering cultivated tomato plants lacking novel genes for drought stress tolerance highly susceptible (Krishna et al., 2022). Prolonged drought also impacts plant-pathogen interactions, resulting in further reductions in productivity due to the combined effect of biotic (TYLCV, ToCV) and drought stresses (Dai et al., 2017). Developing resistant plant varieties against pathogenic and abiotic stress factors is economically significant.", "Recent studies have shown that virus-infected tomato plants exhibit increased tolerance to drought by reducing metabolic activity in leaves and activating defense mechanisms in roots to cope with water scarcity (Mishra et al., 2022). TYLCV and ToCV have the capacity to prevent wilting and crop loss in tomato plants under extreme drought conditions. The virus-resistant tomato plants can be preserved during water scarcity, preventing crop loss during seasons characterized by water deficit, which is of great economic importance.", "Drought stress has a more pronounced impact on qualitative and quantitative indicators in plants compared to other abiotic factors (Rukundo et al., 2014). Severe modifications occur in the morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes of plants when water metabolism is impaired due to drought stress (Torres-Ruiz et al., 2015). Understanding the mechanisms of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses can help develop strategies to optimize crop productivity in severe environments by studying the expression profiling of genes, proteins, and metabolites (Torres-Ruiz et al., 2015). Drought restricts plant growth by reducing the intensity of photosynthesis in affected plants (Liang et al., 2018). Stomatal closure due to decreased CO2 levels, decreased photosynthetic activity in mesophyll tissue (nonstomatal), or both can contribute to the reduction in photosynthesis intensity (Liang et al., 2018). Osmotic substance accumulation, changes in membrane lipid balance, induction of reactive oxygen species synthesis, increased protein synthesis, and alterations in hormonal regulatory pathways play important roles in the development of drought-resistant plants (Liang et al., 2020). Metabolite profiling studies have shown that virus infection enhances plant tolerance to abiotic stresses by inducing the synthesis of osmoprotectants and antioxidants. Virus infection can also increase the level of salicylic acid in an abscisic acid-independent manner, further contributing to drought tolerance (Aguilar et al., 2017).", "The cellulose synthase gene family, which includes the cellulose synthase (CesA) and cellulose synthase-like (Csl) gene families, plays a vital role in cellulose and hemicellulose biosynthesis in plants. These genes are also involved in cell wall biosynthesis, cell elongation, and plant growth (Choe et al., 2021). Some genes associated with the cellulose biosynthesis pathway have been found to show increased resistance to TYLCV infection (Seo et al., 2018). It has been hypothesized that the symptoms caused by TYLCV, which disrupt plant growth, may be directly related to the suppression of cellulose synthesis genes. CesA/Csl genes have also been associated with drought stress, with CesA genes showing increased gene expression under drought-stress conditions (Wang et al., 2023). The expression of CesA/Csl genes may vary during different developmental stages of plants under drought stress (Zhang et al., 2019). However, CesA/Csl genes have not been extensively studied in Solanaceae plants, particularly tomatoes (Song et al., 2019). Therefore, investigating the roles of these genes in response to virus and drought stress in Solanaceae plants, especially in susceptible and/or resistant cultivars, is of great importance for understanding their functions.", "The study of host plant-virus relations has been extensively explored, with significant research addressing this topic. However, there exists a notable gap in our understanding of the combined effect of abiotic and biotic stress factors on plants and the resulting outcomes, as well as the economic implications. Dastogeer et al. (2020) and Poudel et al. (2021) have highlighted this limitation in their research. To address this gap, our research focused on investigating the complex interaction between viruses and drought stress on tomato plants. As a result, we uncovered new priorities for enhancing plant tolerance to both viral infections and severe water reduction. This knowledge can contribute to the development of innovative concepts and strategies vital for combatting the global problem of food insecurity, which is exacerbated by climate change. By utilizing the findings from our research, we can propose the use of virus-resistant cultivars that are infected with the virus during the early stages of development. This approach minimizes yield loss when drought stress is subsequently applied. This novel strategy can have a significant impact on mitigating the negative consequences of both viral infections and water scarcity on crop productivity. The objective of this research was to conduct a physiological (\u201crelative water content,\u201d \u201cspecific leaf weight,\u201d \u201cleaf area,\u201d and \u201cdry biomass\u201d) and comparative analysis of the expression profiles of the cellulose synthase gene superfamily in highly productive but susceptible cultivars under biotic and abiotic stress factors. In this study, we utilized the Money Maker (MK) cultivar as a susceptible genotype (Milc et al., 2019; Siniga Geroge et al., 2013) to drought and virus, and the Shalala (SH) cultivar, recently grown in Azerbaijan fields, with unknown sensitivity/resistance to virus and drought. We analyzed four CesA and Csl genes using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method. qRT-PCR analyses were performed at 1 and 25 time points in both virus-infected and combined virus/drought-stressed MK and SH cultivars. In addition to qRT-PCR studies, we measured four important physiological parameters, including relative water content, specific leaf weight, leaf area, and dry biomass, to assess the impact of virus and drought stress on tomato cultivars. The results obtained from this study are expected to contribute to the development of drought- and virus-resistant crop systems and provide insights into the response and adaptation mechanisms of tomato plants to drought stress.", "In conclusion, while host plant-virus relationships have been extensively studied, the combined effects of abiotic and biotic stress factors, along with their economic implications, have received limited attention. Our research tackles this knowledge gap by examining the intricate interplay between viral infections and drought stress on tomato plants. The resulting insights offer new avenues to improve plant tolerance and contribute to addressing global food insecurity amidst the challenges posed by climate change.", "Materials and Methods", "Materials and Methods", "Plant growth and single-leaflet grafting of TYLCV and ToCV", "Plant growth and single-leaflet grafting of TYLCV and ToCV", "Plant growth and single-leaflet grafting of TYLCV and ToCV", "To investigate the response of tomato plants to the combined effects of virus and drought stresses, we used susceptible Solanum lycopersicum L. cv.

However, it is important to note that these cultivars do not develop immunity against viral infection; rather, they only exhibit systemic infection with mild symptomatology. This crucial information was highlighted by Marchant et al.

To supplement this knowledge, Czosnek (2021) provided insights into the pathophysiological behavior of TYLCV-resistant tomato lines under water shortage conditions.
