["Academic Editor: Diriba Muleta", "Cellulolytic microorganisms secrete cellulase, which plays a crucial role in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into value-added products with diverse applications in industries, such as biofuel, healthcare, and agriculture. As the world transitions to a bioenergy future, cellulase demand is likely to expand. However, the high cost and low catalytic activity of cellulase hinder the commercialization of biorefineries. Searching for cellulase-producing microorganisms in different environments through bioprospecting can aid in broadening the range of cellulases that are currently available. Meanwhile, the cellulolytic activity of marine microorganisms remains largely unexplored, making it difficult to compare the cellulolytic activity of terrestrial and marine environments. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the diversity and activity of culturable cellulolytic microorganisms in four terrestrial and three marine sites within Panay Island, Philippines. The results showed that the cellulolytic microbial load was tenfold higher in the terrestrial sites than in the marine sites, possibly due to the dynamic mangrove environment. Out of the 42 isolates with a high cellulolytic index (CI) of \u22653.0, 36 were from terrestrial and 6 from marine habitats. The CMCase, Avicelase, and FPase activities were then tested on the 18 isolates with the highest CI. It was observed that many isolates had a high CI, but few exhibited high enzyme activities. Marine isolates showed higher CMCase and Avicelase activities, with comparable FPase activity to their terrestrial counterparts. Isolates S1ACP6B from a sugarcane field and MS1OMP2A from a mangrove site exhibited the highest cellulase activities at 0.41 and 0.29\u2009U/mg, respectively, and were identified as Enterobacter roggenkampii and Rhodococcus erythropolis, respectively. Among the 18 identified isolates, three are resistant to chloramphenicol and three isolates are potentially new species of Halomonas sp. MS1ACP1B, Albirhodobacter sp. MP2ACP3B, and Saccharomycetaceae sp. B1CZP10A. Overall, this study provides an insight on the composition of cellulolytic microbial load and their activities among various habitats.", "1.

However, the use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas has significant environmental and health costs. Increasing fossil fuel consumption contributes to the global increase in carbon footprint. With this continuing economic and environmental problem, many researchers around the world have undertaken the challenge of finding solutions by employing new and innovative technologies, such as the conversion of renewable and sustainable biomass into building blocks of polymers and other materials. Bioconversion minimizes carbon emissions and employs inexpensive feedstocks that do not compete with food production and consumption. Recently, the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass has gained popularity due to its potential as a raw material for bioprocesses, which could ameliorate the global energy, food, and climate crises.", "Oil and energy markets are essential to the functioning of the economy.

This natural process is made possible in nature by cellulolytic microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes. Cellulolytic microorganisms play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by secreting cellulase. They regulate the dynamics of soil organic matter, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, and other aspects of nutrient cycling [1].

Due to its widespread use in industries such as food production, agriculture, biofuel, textiles, and healthcare, cellulase has a growing commercial market demand [3]. However, the high cost of cellulase and its low catalytic efficiency have impeded the commercialization of biomass-based manufacturing industries [4, 5]. This means that more research is needed to lower the cost of making cellulase and identify new cellulolytic microorganisms with better catalytic efficiencies. Exploring diverse environments for cellulase-producing microorganisms through bioprospecting offers the potential to broaden the repertoire of available cellulases. Moreover, there is a significant demand for cellulases that possess inherent capabilities to function in extreme environments, meeting the demand of modern biotechnological industries.

This may be due to the area of collection of soil samples within the reforested area in Sibalom where mahogany is the dominant tree species. The low microbial load in Sibalom soil samples may be attributed to its low levels of total nitrogen and organic matter compared to Bulabog Putian Natural Park (Table S1). Both the Sibalom Natural Park and the Bulabog Putian Natural Park are protected reserve areas in Panay Island, and the differences in microbial abundance could be attributed to variations in the soil properties and vegetation cover in each location. Furthermore, the abundance of fungi may be due to the presence of phytochemical tannin in the mahogany trees, which could exert an allelopathic effect on their surroundings. Tannins have been shown to have antibacterial activity and are inherently weak acids, potentially leading to the slight acidity of soil (pH 5.33\u20136.27) [20]. This acidic soil condition may have contributed to the proliferation of fungi, which are known to thrive in undisturbed and slightly acidic environment [21]. Another probable explanation is the prevalence of monoculture in that specific area within Sibalom Natural Park.

Both the Sibalom Natural Park and the Bulabog Putian Natural Park are protected reserve areas in Panay Island, and the differences in microbial abundance could be attributed to variations in the soil properties and vegetation cover in each location. Furthermore, the abundance of fungi may be due to the presence of phytochemical tannin in the mahogany trees, which could exert an allelopathic effect on their surroundings.
