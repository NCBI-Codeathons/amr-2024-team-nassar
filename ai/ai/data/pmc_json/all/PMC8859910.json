An analysis of the genomic context of the oxyR transcriptional regulator gene indicated that it is clustered with other oxidative stress genes, such as the katA gene. Upstream of the oxyR gene, the recG gene (BxeA3988) encoding an ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecG was identified (Fig.\u00a01). Other genes of the LB400 OxyR regulon are the oxyR gene encoding the OxyR transcriptional regulator (BxeA3987) and the gstA1 gene that encodes a glutathione S-transferase (BxeA0624).Fig. 1Genomic context of genes involved in oxidative stress response in P. xenovorans LB400.

The highest identities (>\u200980%) were observed with proteins from bacteria of the order Burkholderiales. Two subunits of the enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase system, AhpC1 and AhpD1, are encoded by the gene cluster ahpC1D1 (BxeA2309 and BxeA2310) on the LB400 major chromosome (C1). The minor chromosome (C2) possesses 7 copies of the gene that encodes the enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit D (AhpD), and the gene cluster ahpC2F (BxeB1205 and BxeB1206).

Unlike LB400 OxyR, which clustered with OxyR from other Burkholderiales order, SoxR of strain LB400 (BxeC1217) formed a singleton suggesting a new clade of SoxR regulators. The SoxR of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 clustered within the first clade with SoxR of A. oleivorans DR1 (Gammaproteobacteria,Pseudomonadales order), and SoxR1 and SoxR2 of A. aquatilis QD168 (Betaproteobacteria; Burkholderiales order) (group I, Fig.\u00a02B). In contrast, P. aeruginosa PAO1 SoxR (Pseudomonadales order; Betaproteobacteria class) formed a singleton. The second clade is composed of SoxR of the Enterobacterales order (E. coli K12, Salmonella typhi CT18, Salmonella typhimurium LT2, Shigella flexneri 301, P. stewartii subsp. stewartii DC283 and Klebsiella pneumoniae KPBj5 E) (group II, Fig.\u00a02B). SoxR of the Gammaproteobacteria Stenotrophomonas maltophilia K279a (Lysobacterales order) and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris P25 (Xanthomonodales order) form the third clade (group III, Fig.\u00a02B). The fourth clade consisted of SoxR of Actinobacteria from the Streptomycetales order, Streptomyces coelicolor M145 and Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680 (group IV, Fig.\u00a02B). SoxR of Chromobacterium violaceum DSM_30191 (Neisseriales order, Betaproteobacteria) formed a singleton.", "P. xenovorans LB400 SoxR has a protective role in P. aeruginosa upon exposure to oxidizing agents", "P. xenovorans LB400 SoxR has a protective role in P. aeruginosa upon exposure to oxidizing agents", "P. xenovorans LB400 SoxR has a protective role in P. aeruginosa upon exposure to oxidizing agents", "In order to determine the functionality of the P. xenovorans LB400 soxR gene (BxeC1217), BxeC1217 was complemented in the null mutant strain P. aeruginosa \u2206soxR.

Paraquat also induced two oxidoreductases (BxeA2478 and BxeA4053), a methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MetF) and a transcriptional regulator of the LysR family (BxeA2466), in whose genomic context the genes encoding the CysP, CysT, CysW and CysA subunits of the sulfate/thiosulfate ABC transporter (BxeA2467-BxeA2470) are present. The repression of the stress chaperones GroEL, GroES, HtpG and Hsp20 was observed during exposure to paraquat (Fig.\u00a06B; Additional file 1: Table S4). Moreover, the expression level of the protein UvrA of the UvrABC system (BxeA4108) decreased.

Oxidative stress response in P. xenovorans LB400 and other bacteria in presence of aromatic compounds has been previously reported. The aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds is catalyzed by mono-and dioxygenases that uses dioxygen as substrate may produce ROS as side products [33, 61]. During p-cymene degradation, LB400 proteome showed an increase of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpC, the organic hydroperoxide resistance protein Ohr, and the molecular chaperones DnaK, GroEL and ClpB [3]. p-Cymene also induced diverse proteins of the energy metabolism, such as aconitase AcnA, succinyl-CoA synthetase, ATP synthase, enolase and pyruvate kinase, which are required for the high-energy demand during the adaptation of glucose-grown LB400 cells to aromatic compounds.

During p-cymene degradation, LB400 proteome showed an increase of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpC, the organic hydroperoxide resistance protein Ohr, and the molecular chaperones DnaK, GroEL and ClpB [3]. p-Cymene also induced diverse proteins of the energy metabolism, such as aconitase AcnA, succinyl-CoA synthetase, ATP synthase, enolase and pyruvate kinase, which are required for the high-energy demand during the adaptation of glucose-grown LB400 cells to aromatic compounds. (Chloro)biphenyls degradation by P. xenovorans LB400 involves oxidative stress, inducing the synthesis of an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpC and molecular chaperones DnaK, GroEL, HtpG and elongation factor G [2, 61]. Chlorobenzoates also generate a general stress response in LB400 cells, inducing the expression of the molecular chaperones DnaK and HtpG [48]. Burkholderia sp. BNS showed during phenol catabolism an increase in superoxide dismutase, DNA repair enzymes RecN and RadA, and chaperones Hsp15 and Hsp12 [47]. Fluoranthene catabolism induces expression of catalase and superoxide dismutase in Mycobacterium sp. JS14 [42]. Bacillus subtilis 168 showed a oxidative stress response to catechol, inducing the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase genes [74]. The addition of antioxidants and the reconfiguration of metabolic fluxes are useful strategies to counteracting oxidative stress of the model aromatic-degraders P. xenovorans, P. putida and other bacterial strains, which may increase the degradation and bioremediation of persistent organic pollutants [26, 54, 61].", "High redundancy of antioxidant genes. The broad genetic repertoire of antioxidant genes identified in P. xenovorans LB400 (Fig.\u00a01; Additional file 1: Table S2) correlates with its high resistance to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. LB400 has two clusters encoding two complete alkyl hydroperoxide reductase systems (ahpC1D1 and ahpC2F), and 7 additional ahpD gene copies in its genome, which are unusual high ahp gene copies in bacteria. In aerobic bacteria, the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase detoxifies organic hydroperoxides and H2O2 during oxidative stress. In E. coli, B. subtilis, Salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium and Xanthomonas spp., this enzyme consists of two subunits, a minor subunit with peroxidase activity (AhpC, 22\u00a0kDa), and a major subunit with disulfide reductase activity (AhpF, 57\u00a0kDa) [62]. AhpC has been reported as the main antioxidant mechanism against endogenous H2O2 production in E. coli [68]. In S. coelicolor and Mycobacterium species, the ahpF gene is absent, whereas downstream of the ahpC gene is located the ahpD gene, which encodes a thioredoxin-like protein (19\u00a0kDa) involved as electron donor in the disulfide reduction of AhpC. Notably, P. xenovorans LB400 encodes both AhpCF and AhpCD systems, which has been rarely observed in bacteria. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that Paraburkholderia hospital BS001 has genes encoding five AhpC, one AhpD and one AhpF, whereas Paraburkholderia terrae possess four AhpC, one AhpD and one AhpF. In Burkholderia thailandensis, the AphCD system has been recently characterized [82]. E. coli K12, P. putida KT2440 and B. subtilis 168 possess only one or two copies of AhpC and one AhpF. S. coelicolor ATCC BAA-471, Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens JCM 10833 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATCC 25618 possess one or two copies of AhpC and one or two copies of AhpD.", "High redundancy of antioxidant genes.

LB400 KatE possesses a sequence identity of 27.6, 15.3 and 8.8% with LB400 KatA, KatG and KatN, respectively.

Three superoxide dismutase-encoding genes were identified in strain LB400. Superoxide dismutase detoxifies superoxide radical, transforming it in H2O2 and O2 [29]. Strain LB400 showed high gene redundancy for the oxidative stress response, redundancy that has been previously described in this bacterium for genes involved in aromatic degradation [14]. A lower redundancy of antioxidant genes (4 ahp, 3\u00a0kat, 2 sod) has been reported in P. aeruginosa [55].

In this study, the functionality of OxyR and SoxR regulators in P. xenovorans LB400 was demostrated, which showed a protective role against oxidizing agents. The role of the soxR gene of P. xenovorans LB400 was determined by a complementation assay. In our study, the mutant strain P. aeruginosa \u0394soxR complemented with the LB400 soxR gene (BxeC1217) was less sensitive to paraquat and phenazine methosulphate, two superoxide-producing compounds. This is particularly interesting considering that SoxR phylogenetic analysis revealed that on one side SoxR of LB400 strain is not closely related to other well characterized SoxR, forming a distinct clade, and on the other side, SoxR showed only 33% identity with its closed bacterial SoxR. The complemented strain \u2206soxR::BxeC1217 also changed P. aeruginosa pigmentation. These results indicate that the regulator SoxR of P. xenovorans LB400 is functional, playing an important role to protect bacteria from superoxide-producing agents (paraquat and PMS), and may activate a specific regulon of not enteric bacteria involved in phenazine production in P. aeruginosa. The SoxR regulator is a redox-sensitive transcriptional activator during oxidative stress produced by endogenous or environmental factors. SoxR of P. aeruginosa is activated by compounds that produce superoxide, such as paraquat, or also by its own synthesized phenazines [22, 30, 36]. P. aeruginosa SoxR activates the PumA monooxygenase and the MexGHI-OpmD efflux pump, which are involved in the modulation of cellular intracellular redox state, and the resistance to exogenous and endogenous phenazines [21, 22, 65, 72]. PumA converts the exogenous phenazine PMS into a highly oxidized compound, a mechanism also proposed for intracellular phenazines produced by P. aeruginosa PA14 to control the internal phenazine pool and the redox intracellular state [72]. SoxR from P. putida, A. oleivorans, S. coelicolor, and E. coli are differentially activated by redox-active compounds [34, 42], which could also be the case of LB400 SoxR, inducing an divergent activation of the SoxR regulon in P. aeruginosa that may explain \u2206soxR::BxeC1217 yellow-green pigmentation, probably associated with the synthesis of the yellow phenazine-1-carboxylic acid and the blue phenazine pyocyanin [21].", "Functionality of OxyR and SoxR regulators.

Paraquat is a continuous source of superoxide radical in the cytoplasm. Paraquat and H2O2 may activate the OxyR transcriptional regulator in non-enteric bacteria. Interestingly, we observed that paraquat induces stronger the expression of LB400 OxyR than hydrogen peroxide.

The physiological and molecular response of strain LB400 upon exposure to paraquat and H2O2 is summarized in Fig.\u00a08. H2O2 showed after shorter incubation growth inhibition and increased cytoplasmic ROS accumulation probably due to its oxidizing nature, whereas paraquat showed negative effects on growth and increased cytoplasmic ROS formation only after a longer exposure likely because it requires first to generate radicals. Paraquat showed a higher reduction of cell density than H2O2, probably due to its continuous production of superoxide in the cytoplasm and the membrane diffusion limitation of H2O2. In E. coli the membrane permeability coefficient for H2O2 is 1.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u00a0cm/s, indicating that H2O2 diffusion inside the cell is limited [69]. This could explain that different concentration of H2O2 showed no significant differences on growth in liquid medium (Fig.\u00a04B) and in solid medium (Fig.\u00a04C). During the period between 120 and 300\u00a0min, the growth rates of cells exposed to different H2O2-concentration and control condition were similar (~\u200910\u20134\u00a0h\u22121). In presence of paraquat, higher concentration of the oxidizing agent increased the negative effect on bacterial density, probably to the higher production of superoxide radical inside the cell. Proteomic and transcriptional analyses also indicated that paraquat induced a stronger oxidative stress response than hydrogen peroxide. During exposure to paraquat, the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase system AhpC2F was induced. In addition, the upregulation of the oxyR and ahpC1 genes of strain LB400 was observed in the presence of paraquat and H2O2, whereas an increase in the katE gene expression was observed in cells incubated with H2O2. The increase of the ahpC1 gene expression during exposure to paraquat suggests that the superoxide radical produced by paraquat is reduced by superoxide dismutase into H2O2. These results suggest that P. xenovorans displays a broad antioxidant response that includes AhpCF, a catalase and the DpsA protein to protect from the oxidative stress generated by both paraquat and H2O2, which probably is regulated by OxyR. The hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium A. aquatilis QD168 also showed an upregulation of its two ahpC gene copies upon paraquat exposure [25]. In bacteria, detoxification of H2O2 is carried out mainly by the action of alkyl hydroperoxide reductases and catalases [29, 58]. In E. coli, the AhpCF enzyme is activated by the regulator OxyR [28]. This indicates that the presence of H2O2 and paraquat may be triggering the expression of LB400 oxidative stress genes that are probably regulated by the transcriptional regulator OxyR. The oxyR gene also increased its expression in strain LB400 in presence of paraquat (>\u200914-fold) and H2O2 (fourfold). In E. coli, the OxyR regulator activates a specific antioxidant response against H2O2 with transcription of several oxidative stress genes [28]. The OxyR regulator in E. coli is sensitive to H2O2, whereas in P. aeruginosa other non-enteric models the OxyR regulator is activated by different oxidizing agents such as paraquat and H2O2 [23].

The upregulation of thioredoxin reductases and the Fe-S protein of high potential Hpf in presence of H2O2 and paraquat, are probably contributing to the LB400 redox state of cells providing reducing power in these oxidizing conditions. Fe-S proteins of high potential are electron-donors that contain a cytochrome tetraheme in their active center [78]. Thioredoxin reductases are widely distributed homodimeric flavoproteins.

Paraquat is a continuous source of superoxide radical, which explains the upregulation of the sodB1 gene in strain LB400. In E. coli, genes encoding for the scavenging enzyme SodB1 and ROS-resistant isoform of fumarate hydratase FumC are regulated by SoxRS in response to superoxide [29]. P. putida KT2440 exposed to this oxidizing agent also showed an expression increase of the sodA and fumC1 genes [57]. In strain LB400, the ROS-sensitive aconitase AcnB was downregulated in presence of paraquat (Fig.\u00a06). Aconitate hydratase catalyzes the reversible isomerization of citrate and isocitrate via cis-aconitate in the Krebs cycle. In E. coli, the aconitase AcnB is susceptible to oxidative stress, whereas the aconitase AcnA, which is not dependent on a [4Fe\u20134S] cluster, plays an important role in survival during oxidative stress [18]. Superoxide radical produced by paraquat could damage [4Fe\u20134S] dehydratases such as AcnB [79]. This ROS could remove an Fe2+ ion from the [4Fe\u20134S] cluster, inactivating this enzyme [29]. The continuous generation of superoxide radical by paraquat leads to a recurring inactivation of the ROS-sensitive aconitase AcnB. To synthetize an enzyme that could be constantly inactivated represent an unnecessary metabolic burden for the cell, which may explain the downregulation of AcnB when strain LB400 was exposed to paraquat.

A gene encoding the OhrR transcriptional regulator of the MarR family was identified upstream of the LB400 ohr gene (BxeB2843). Interestingly, the Ohr protein in P. aeruginosa is essential for resistance to organic hydroperoxides but not to H2O2 or paraquat, whereas its induction is independent of OxyR [56].

Strain LB400 showed a high resistance to the oxidizing agents paraquat and H2O2 compared to other bacteria. Strain LB400 was capable to resist until 16\u00a0mM H2O2 (Fig.\u00a04B). In contrast, H2O2 1.25\u00a0mM and 2.5\u00a0mM inhibit the growth of E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively [8]. P. pseudomonas MPAO1 growth is inhibited by a H2O2 (0.6\u00a0mM) [20]. P. xenovorans LB400 showed much higher survival to paraquat compared to other bacteria. Strain LB400 exposed during 1\u00a0h to paraquat (16\u00a0mM) showed\u2009~\u200996% survival. In comparison, E. coli K-12 after 45\u00a0min-exposure to paraquat (0.1\u00a0mM), showed\u2009~\u200975% survival [49]. P. aeruginosa PAO1 was also less resistant to 0.2\u00a0mM paraquat [46]. P. xenovorans strain LB400 exposed to paraquat (20\u00a0mM) revealed an inhibition zone of\u2009~\u200938 mm2, while Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 treated with paraquat (7.8\u00a0mM) showed an inhibition halo\u2009>\u2009900 mm2 [53]. Nevertheless, B. subtilis CU1065 is more resistant than strain LB400, showing in presence of paraquat (0.5\u00a0M) an inhibition zone of 27 mm2 [10]. The reducing power (e.g., NADH, NADPH) generated by the metabolism in the cells is crucial to generate a response to oxidative stress. Interestingly, P. xenovorans LB400 and most of the Burkholderia sensu lato strains metabolize glucose and other sugars through the Entner-Douderoff (ED) pathway and the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway but not through the classical upper Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway because they lack the 6-phosphofructokinase pfk gene [1]. The ED pathway and the PP pathway are linked to the lower EMP pathway, producing NAD(P)H reducing power. The activation of the ED route increased the levels of NAD(P)H, which allowed to generate an effective response against the oxidative stress generated by the aerobic metabolism in P. putida KT2440 [15, 54]. The induction of NAD reducing enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in E. coli, caused an accumulation of NADH via ferredoxin NADP reductase, resulting in the activation of the SoxRS response and an increased tolerance to paraquat [38].
