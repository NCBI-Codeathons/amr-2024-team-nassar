The interactions between endophytes and host not only promote the growth and development of each other but also drive the biosynthesis of many new medicinal active substances. In this review, we summarized recent reports related to the interactions between endophytes and hosts, mainly regarding the research progress of endophytes affecting the growth and development of host plants, physiological stress and the synthesis of new compounds. Then, we also discussed the positive effects of multiomics analysis on the interactions between endophytes and their hosts, as well as the application and development prospects of metabolites synthesized by symbiotic interactions. This review may provide a reference for the further development and utilization of endophytes and the study of their interactions with their hosts.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Endophytes are special \u201cmicroorganism\u201d with much value. They can parasitize different parts of living plants but do not obviously cause symptoms of external infection in host plants or symbiosis and coevolution with their host (Chen et al., 2022). As an important cooperative \u201cpartner\u201d of plant growth and development, endophytes greatly impact on host physiological metabolism, which helps or stimulates host plants against various stresses (Koskim\u00e4ki et al., 2022). More importantly, during this long-term association, the endophytes and their host form an interactive relationship of coevolution and mutually beneficial symbiosis. The genetics and metabolism of endophytes ameliorate and supplement the material metabolic pathway and related gene expression of their hosts (Mei et al., 2019). Conversely, the host also creates a unique community structure and gene characteristics of endophytes (Oukala et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022).", "Endophytes are special \u201cmicroorganism\u201d with much value.

For example, the medicinal plant Camptotheca acuminata kills invading microorganisms by producing camptothecin, which competitively inhibits the activity of the microbial topoisomerase I complex (Khaiwa et al., 2021). Fusarium solani, an endophytic fungus in Camptotheca acuminata, uses special amino acid residues to bind the relatively active domain of camptothecin to escape the attack of the host, while the other endophytes avoid the invasion risk by encoding a unique topoisomerase. Therefore, the colonization of endophytes is not easy (Sirikantaramas et al., 2009; Kusari et al., 2011, 2012a). Robinson\u2019s results showed that the rhizosphere-dominant bacterium Bacillus mycoides could not colonize wheat in an aseptic system without competitive bacteria (Robinson et al., 2016). Further studies found that when competitive bacteria exist, wheat secretes special root exudates, which are rich in nutrients and can induce and promote Bacillus mycoides symbiosis (Robinson et al., 2016). In addition, Wang successfully colonized rhizobia in the roots of legumes by applying exogenous metabolites of flavonoids to realize the symbiosis of endophytes (Wang et al., 2021).

Studies suggest that endophytes affect plants mainly in two aspects. On the one hand, endophytes induced systemic resistance (ISR) production in the host. ISR differs from traditional system acquired resistance (SAR) in that its phenotype is similar to that of pathogen induced SAR, both of which can induce broad-spectrum resistance to pathogens in plants (Pieterse et al., 2014; Pozo et al., 2015). In essence, ISR differs from other induced-resistance mechanisms in that the host usually has primic defense associated with the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway under symbiotic association, and can initiate faster, stronger, and more durable defense expression under adverse conditions (Martinez-Medina et al., 2016; Teixeira et al., 2019). However, the mechanism of \u201cpriming\u201d state is still unclear, and it is speculated that transcription factors and related signals play an important role in it (Bentham et al., 2020; Mengistu, 2020). On the other hand, endophytes can effectively regulate defense-related signaling pathways in the host to achieve self-colonization and thus establish symbiotic links with host plants. After colonization, endophytes invasion plants, are bound to across the plant immune system highly complex in the first line of defense, also known as microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMP), a process that involves many molecules [such as elongation factors Tu (EF-Tu), peptidoglycan (PG), superoxide dismutase (SOD), \u03b2-chitosan bacteria cold shock protein (RNP1motif), chitin, etc.] and the specificity of the host cell surface receptor molecules PRR identification (Newman et al., 2013). Under current conditions, although it is known that symbiosis with endophytes endows hosts with additional defense mechanisms, little is known about this aspect (Eid et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2021). In fact, plant immune system activation and mechanical changes are the result of ongoing molecular dialogue with endophytes, a common example of which is the JA pathway discussed above (Gutjahr, 2014; Pozo et al., 2015; Bastias et al., 2017). After plant infection with endophytes, the salicylic acid (SA) pathway is usually inhibited, the JA precursor level is enhanced, and then the JA reaction gene is upregulated (Wasternack and Hause, 2013). However, different from the SA pathway, the JA pathway is not well understood (Zhang M. J. et al., 2021). Existing studies believe that the increase of JA pathway seems to be related to the development and function of mycorrhizal symbiosis, which may be understood and verified in future studies (Siciliano et al., 2007).", "At present, it is very important to find and understand the growth mechanism of host endophytes.

At the same time, the ability to synthesize plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is utilized to promote host growth and repair host activity during toxic damage (Glick and Stearns, 2011). Besides, some endophytes affect host growth through their own metabolism.

Some endophytes isolated from soybean root nodules promote the absorption of P by their hosts by dissolving P minerals (Varga et al., 2020). In addition, N, P, C and other elements were also stronger in soybean plants infected with endophytic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) than in uninfected soybean plants.

Through the above series of biochemical reactions, endophytes can regulate host permeability to reduce or even offset the effects of stress and can finally achieve the purpose of repairing damage (Wang et al., 2020; Figure 3). Baek et al. (2020) found that salt stress-related genes were expressed in the shoots and roots of rice seedlings after infecting them with endophytic bacterium Bacillus oryzicola YC7007. AMF, an endophytic fungus isolated from chickpeas, can help the host to relieve drought stress (Hashem et al., 2019). In addition, under salt stress, some endophytic fungi can secrete exopolysaccharide to change soil structure, regulate soil material composition and change host permeability, so as to relieve stress (Kidd et al., 2021).", "Effect of endophytes on host abiotic stress tolerance.", "Effect of endophytes on host abiotic stress tolerance.", "Effect of endophytes on host abiotic stress tolerance.", "Effect of endophytes on host abiotic stress tolerance.", "Endophytic strains Sources Changes in matter Functions References.", "Endophytic strains Sources Changes in matter Functions References.", "Endophytic strains Sources Changes in matter Functions References.", "Endophytic strains Sources Changes in matter Functions References.", "Fusarium, Alternaria Glycine max (Linn.)

Baek et al. (2020) isolated the endophytic bacterium Bacillus oryzicola YC7007 from the rhizosphere of rice (Oryza sativa), which can induce systemic resistance and antibiotics, inhibit rice bacterial diseases and promote rice growth and development.

On the other hand, endophytes can colonize hosts in a manner similar to the invasion of pathogens, which creates niche competition with pathogens (Ahmed et al., 2020). Therefore, plants can recruit endophytes and reduce the possibility of colonization of their own pathogens by giving priority to occupying the niche. Researchers isolated the endophytic bacterium Stenotrophomonas from Pistacia chinensis, which can preferentially occupy the niche by producing iron carriers, thus reducing the colonization of pathogenic bacteria and further relieving the iron stress environment of Pistacia chinensis (Etminani and Harighi, 2018). In addition, endophytes can also help hosts to cope with insect feeding. The endophytic alkaloid metabolites and neurotoxins may lead to disordered behavior, hindered growth and development, and even death of insects (Song et al., 2020; Tooker and Giron, 2020; Grabka et al., 2022).

At present, although there have been an increasing number of studies on endophytes, there have been few reports on the large-scale application of endophytic preparations and their active metabolites in commercial production. The utilization of endophyte biological resources is still difficult, and there is no effective detection technology to directly identify endophytic bacteria in vivo from their host. In vitro endophyte isolation, culture and even fermentation cannot accurately obtain the corresponding strains or even metabolites. In addition, there are interactions between endophytes in the host, which undoubtedly adds difficulties in endophytes study. The mystery of endophytes is gradually being revealed. In future, on the basis of ensuring the biological activity of isolated and cultured endophytes, the improvement of their characteristics and application in basic research and commercial production will be of great significance. For example, new drugs can be created to treat diseases and for agricultural production. Regulating host gene expression and pathways improves the growth of valuable medicinal plants, realizing transgenic breeding and improving crop quality. Now is the time to elevate endophyte research from traditional physiological and biochemical research to higher cellular- and molecular-level research. Combined with omics technology, a database of endophytes and their active metabolites should be established. Then, the database should be used to understand the unknown field of endophytes and host interactions and to benefit from it.", "Solving the above problems will not only help to tap into the ecological functions of endophytes but will also further improve the application potential of endophytes and will provide a base for the further development and utilization of endophytes.
