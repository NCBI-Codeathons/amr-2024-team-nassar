["The authors declare no conflict of interest.", "ABSTRACT", "The antibiotic desertomycin A and its previously undescribed inactive N-succinylated analogue, desertomycin X, were isolated from Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038. Genome sequencing and analysis readily identified the desertomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), which lacked genes encoding acyltransferases that would account for desertomycin X formation. Scouting the genome for putative N-acyltransferase genes led to the identification of a candidate within a cryptic siderophore BGC (csb) encoding a putative homologue of the N6\u2032-hydroxylysine acetyltransferase IucB. Expression of the codon-optimized gene designated csbC in Escherichia coli yielded the recombinant protein that was able to N-succinylate desertomycin A as well as several other structurally distinct antibiotics harboring amino groups. Some antibiotics were rendered antibiotically inactive due to the CsbC-catalyzed succinylation in vitro. Unlike many known N-acyltransferases involved in antibiotic resistance, CsbC could not efficiently acetylate the same antibiotics. When expressed in E. coli, CsbC provided low-level resistance to kanamycin and ampicillin, suggesting that it may play a role in antibiotic resistance in natural habitats, where the concentration of antibiotics is usually low.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Antibiotics are secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by certain bacteria and fungi, which are not required for growth, development, or reproduction, but may provide an advantage in competition for nutrients or defense against predators in natural environments. Genes encoding enzymes for the biosynthesis of SMs are usually colocalized in the genome and form so-called \u201cbiosynthetic gene clusters\u201d (BGCs). Typical BGCs contain \u201ccore\u201d genes responsible for the biosynthesis of a molecular scaffold, accessory genes encoding enzymes for scaffold modification, genes that regulate the BGC\u2019s expression, and resistance genes for self-protection against the endogenously produced compound (1). Actinomycetes, filamentous Gram-positive bacteria of the phylum Actinobacteria, produce thousands of SMs, including ca 50% of all clinically used antibiotics (2). Actinomycetes protect themselves from the toxic effects of endogenously produced antibiotics using a variety of specific mechanisms (3). For example, the ErmE protein of the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea catalyzes methylation of 23S rRNA, thus preventing binding of erythromycin to the ribosome and inhibiting protein synthesis (4). The tetracycline producer Streptomyces rimosus encodes, within the tetracycline BGC, a transmembrane protein channel that pumps the antibiotic out of the cells by coupling antibiotic excretion with proton import (5, 6). Other prevalent examples of resistance mechanisms are the direct enzymatic modification of antibiotics via hydrolysis or transfer of a specific chemical group that prevents an antibiotic from binding to its target. Despite the structural diversity of antibiotics, two modes of the latter modification predominate: N-acetylation of amino groups and O-phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups, for which the donor cofactors are acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) and ATP, respectively (6). N-Acetylation of amino groups is catalyzed by GNAT enzymes (Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferases), most of which use acetyl-CoA as a cosubstrate (7). However, GNAT proteins exist that prefer different acyl donors, such as myristoyl-CoA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8) or succinyl-CoA in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (9). The latter protein was shown to both acylate and succinylate mycobacterial nucleoid-associated protein HU (10). The involvement of N-acetyltransferases in antibiotic resistance first was shown in the kanamycin producer Streptomyces kanamyceticus, which possesses an aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferase (AAC) activity (11). The aac gene (new designation kanM) encoding the AAC enzyme has been cloned in Streptomyces\nlividans, where it functioned as a resistance determinant against kanamycin (12, 13). Except for the aforementioned KanM enzyme from S. kanamyceticus, not much information is available about the AAC proteins from Streptomyces.", "Antibiotics are secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by certain bacteria and fungi, which are not required for growth, development, or reproduction, but may provide an advantage in competition for nutrients or defense against predators in natural environments.

While desertomycin A inhibited the growth of both Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli (data not shown), desertomycin X was antibiotically inactive. This observation suggested that the succinyl group attached to the primary amine is detrimental for the antibacterial activity of desertomycin. In order to properly assess antibiotic activity of desertomycin A, it was tested, along with some clinically relevant antibiotics, on a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the broth microdilution method. This test did not reveal any measurable activity of desertomycin A against Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli, at concentrations below 128\u2009\u03bcg/mL. This can be explained by different physiological conditions of bacterial cultures on the solid agar medium (initial disk assay) and in liquid cultures (CLSI method).

In this work, we identified in a Streptomyces sp. a new congener of the known antibiotic desertomycin A, designated desertomycin X, which is antibiotically inactive and only differs from the former by the presence of an N-succinyl group. This suggested that N-succinylation may represent a previously undescribed resistance mechanism. Although resistance genes are in most cases colocalized with the antibiotic biosynthesis genes, no such gene, which would presumably encode an N-succinyltransferase, was found in the desertomycin biosynthesis gene cluster. The search for a possible candidate led us to examine a BGC termed csb that specifies the biosynthesis of a cryptic siderophore. A putative GNAT family acyltransferase encoded by the csbC gene in this cluster distinguished itself from known N-acyltransferases that use acetyl-CoA as acyl group donor to modify and inactivate certain antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides (7). In particular, CsbC had an ca. 80-amino-acid-extended N terminus which contained a polyproline signature, a feature found only in homologous uncharacterized proteins encoded by similar BGCs in 3 Streptomyces spp. CsbC contains domains with similarity to the AAC(6\u2032) protein Rv1347c, which was suggested by Card et al. to be involved in both antibiotic resistance and mycobactin biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (17). However, neither role of the Rv1347c protein was experimentally verified in enzyme assays with acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and butyryl-CoA. We hypothesized that CsbC may be responsible for the N-succinylation of desertomycin A, which was confirmed via expression of recombinant CsbC in E. coli followed by N-acylation activity testing in vitro. Moreover, CsbC could efficiently N-succinylate structurally distinct antibiotics as well as some primary metabolites. Some of those, in which an amino group important for interaction with the molecular target was blocked via succinylation, lost all or most of their antibiotic activity.

Expression of the native, non-codon-optimized csbC in S. lividans did not lead to increased kanamycin resistance in this bacterium.

Notably, the recombinant CsbC was able to confer kanamycin and ampicillin resistance in E. coli, albeit only to a low level. In the experiment with kanamycin, it was apparent that IPTG-induced CsbC expression detrimentally affected the growth of recombinant E. coli BL21, most likely due to the overexpression of T7 polymerase (22), but maybe also due to the depletion of succinyl-CoA, which is a less abundant cellular metabolite than acetyl-CoA (23). Another explanation could be succinylation of primary metabolites, such as putrescine and ornithine (see the Results section), that would render them unsuitable for anabolic pathways.
