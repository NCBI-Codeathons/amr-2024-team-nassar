Targeted inactivation of ncmB led to nocamycin production being completely abolished, which demonstrates that this gene cluster is involved in nocamycin biosynthesis. To generate new nocamycin derivatives, the gene ncmG, encoding for a cytochrome P450 oxidase, was inactivated. Two new nocamycin derivatives nocamycin III and nocamycin IV were isolated from the ncmG deletion mutant strain and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data analyses.

Then, S. syringae NRRL B-16468 genome data was analyzed by using online antiSMASH tool [27]. AntiSMASH analysis results demonstrated that a hybrid PKS-NRPS gene cluster designated as Ncm seems to be the candidate responsible for nocamycin biosynthesis since it shows high similarity to tirandamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. In the Ncm gene cluster, some deduced gene products such as NcmC, NcmE, NcmF and NcmB show high similarity to TrdC, TrdE, TrdF and TrdB originated from tirandamycin biosynthetic pathway, respectively [14]. Thus, we assumed that this cluster is probably involved in nocamycin biosynthesis. We then screened S. syringae genomic library by using PCR method with the primer pairs targeted at ncmG, ncmC and dehydratase (DH) domain at module 4. In total of eight positive cosmids were obtained. The eight cosmids were end-sequenced and two cosmids p2-H-12 and p5-H-9 were used for further gene inactivation experiments.

This abnormal DH domain at module 4 are likely not to catalyze the dehydration reaction to afford C-10 and C-11 double bond because the C-11 hydroxy group is absolutely required for the C-13 spiroketal group formation and no nocamycin derivatives possess C-10 and C-11 double bond have been identified.

Firstly, the earliest intermediate released from the PCP protein possesses a hydroxyl group in C-11 position, NcmE catalyze the dehydration process to afford nocamycin III. Next, nocamycin III undergoes several oxidative and one methyl esterification steps to produce nocamycin I. At last, NcmD catalyzes the dehydrogenation process to afford nocamycin II. Comparisons of gene clusters of tirandamycin and nocamycin revealed an interesting phenomenon that the post-tailoring enzymes involved in modification of similar structure are varied. In tirandamycin biosynthetic pathway, a FAD-dependent dehydrogenase TrdL/TamL is responsible for the conversion from C-10 hydroxyl to C-10 ketone [15, 16]. In our initial hypothesis, a TrdL/TamL homologous protein is predicted to be responsible for the same process, however, no TrdL/TamL homologous protein has been observed within the gene cluster. Although NcmL shows FAD-binding domain, it lacks the conserved bicovalent FAD linked active sites to that in TamL/TrdL [15, 16]. Meanwhile, the gene inactivation experiments revealed that NcmL shows no relationship to nocamycin biosynthesis, and this result also indicates that diversified modification mechanism occurred in this class of natural products. Overview the gene cluster, the short-chain dehydrogenase NcmD is the best candidate to catalyze the last C-10 dehydrogenation step in nocamycin biosynthetic pathway. The complex oxidative modifications including formation of fused oxolane ring system in bicyclic ketal moiety and the conversion from methyl group to carboxyl are intriguing issues, and the two cytochrome P450 oxidase NcmG and NcmO are expected to be involved in these steps. Two new derivatives nocamycin III and nocamycin IV lacking of closed tetrahydrofuran ring from \u0394ncmG mutant strain indicates NcmG\u2019s involvement in the formation of the fused oxolane ring system. In terms of oxolane ring system formation, four different biosynthetic routes have been envisioned [52\u201355]. The mechanism of tetrahydrofuran ring in nocamycin is proposed to be similar to that in nonactin biosynthesis pathway [52]. NcmG is likely to catalyze conjugate addition of C-15 hydroxyl groups to the adjacent C-11 and C-12 alkenyl moiety to form oxolane ring (Fig.\u00a04). We notice that the C-20 hydroxyl in nocamycin IV is similar to C-18 hydroxyl in tirandamycin B. In tirandamycin biosynthetic pathway, a multifunctional cytochrome P450 TamI has been verified to be responsible for the formation of C-18 hydroxyl group [15]. However, C-20 hydroxylation modification is not required in nocamycin biosynthetic pathway (Fig.\u00a04). Thus, we hypothesize that nocamycin IV is probably a shunt product in nocamycins biosynthetic pathway and an oxidase located elsewhere of the genome can catalyze the hydroxylation process. Considerations of several oxidative modifications are required to afford nocamycin II, one of NcmG and NcmO is potentially responsible for more than one oxidative tailoring steps.

The mechanism of tetrahydrofuran ring in nocamycin is proposed to be similar to that in nonactin biosynthesis pathway [52]. NcmG is likely to catalyze conjugate addition of C-15 hydroxyl groups to the adjacent C-11 and C-12 alkenyl moiety to form oxolane ring (Fig.\u00a04). We notice that the C-20 hydroxyl in nocamycin IV is similar to C-18 hydroxyl in tirandamycin B. In tirandamycin biosynthetic pathway, a multifunctional cytochrome P450 TamI has been verified to be responsible for the formation of C-18 hydroxyl group [15]. However, C-20 hydroxylation modification is not required in nocamycin biosynthetic pathway (Fig.\u00a04). Thus, we hypothesize that nocamycin IV is probably a shunt product in nocamycins biosynthetic pathway and an oxidase located elsewhere of the genome can catalyze the hydroxylation process. Considerations of several oxidative modifications are required to afford nocamycin II, one of NcmG and NcmO is potentially responsible for more than one oxidative tailoring steps. Elucidation of the exact roles of NcmG and NcmO and the timing of modification in nocamycin biosynthesis is our ongoing project.", "Up to now, the biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for streptolydigin, tirandamycin and nocamycin biosynthesis have been identified. Comparisons of the three gene clusters will help us deeply understand the biosynthetic mechanisms of this small class of natural products. The genetic insights and elucidations of enzyme function will facilitate us to rationally generate new derivatives with improved pharmacological property by manipulating biosynthetic pathway.", "Up to now, the biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for streptolydigin, tirandamycin and nocamycin biosynthesis have been identified.

In this report, we identify nocamycins biosynthetic gene cluster from rare actinomycete Saccharothrix syringae, which provides us the genetic insights into nocamycins biosynthesis and enzyme candidates for several intriguing biochemical transformations. Inactivation of cytochrome P450 monoxygenase NcmG led to isolation of two novel nocamycin derivatives from the mutant strain. Based on gene cluster data and new derivatives isolated from gene inactivation mutant strain, a putative biosynthetic pathway of nocamycin is proposed. These findings provide insights into further investigation of nocamycin biosynthetic mechanism, and also set the stage to rationally engineer new nocamycin derivatives via manipulating biosynthetic pathway.", "The nocamycin I and II, bearing a tricyclic ketal moiety, belong to acyl tetramic acid natural products and they display broad antimicrobial activity.
