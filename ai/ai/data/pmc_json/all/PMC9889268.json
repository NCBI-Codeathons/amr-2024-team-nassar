["Colibactin, a DNA cross-linking agent produced by gut bacteria, is implicated in colorectal cancer. Its biosynthesis uses a prodrug resistance mechanism: a non-toxic precursor assembled in the cytoplasm is activated after export to the periplasm. This activation is mediated by ClbP, an inner-membrane peptidase with an N-terminal periplasmic catalytic domain and a C-terminal three-helix transmembrane domain. Although the transmembrane domain is required for colibactin activation, its role in catalysis is unclear. Our structure of full-length ClbP bound to a product analog reveals an interdomain interface important for substrate binding and enzyme stability and interactions that explain the selectivity of ClbP for the N-acyl-d-asparagine prodrug motif. Based on structural and biochemical evidence, we propose that ClbP dimerizes to form an extended substrate-binding site that can accommodate a pseudodimeric precolibactin with its two terminal prodrug motifs in the two ClbP active sites, thus enabling the coordinated activation of both electrophilic warheads.", "", "Structure and mutagenesis of the colibactin-activating peptidase ClbP reveals a dimer with a substrate-binding transmembrane domain and a conserved polar network in its periplasmic domain that enforces selectivity for d-asparagine prodrug motifs.", "Subject terms", "Main", "Main", "Colibactin is a small-molecule genotoxin produced by gut bacteria and extra-intestinal pathogenic strains, and it is implicated in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer1,2.

We built sequence similarity networks (SSNs) from protein sequences encoded by genes for which a genomic neighborhood of at least ten genes in either direction was available, using representative nodes at 100% identity to eliminate identical sequences and an expectation value cutoff of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221290. Based on the genomic neighborhoods, we identified four clusters within the SSN containing ClbP homologs from amicoumacin23, colibactin1,6,7, edeine24, paenilamicin25, xenocoumacin26 and zwittermicin27 biosynthetic gene clusters (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). These homologs are mostly in Firmicutes but also in Proteobacteria (Extended Data Fig. 1c), and their length is either ClbP-like (~450 amino acids) or ZmaM-like (~1,100 amino acids) (Extended Data Fig. 1d). These analyses also suggest that several Gram-positive Paenibacillus strains produce a compound highly similar to colibactin and that edeine biosynthesis employs an N-acyl-d-asparagine prodrug peptidase mechanism. This hypothesis is validated in an accompanying paper, in which a ClbP inhibitor stimulates accumulation of newly identified preedeines in a Brevibacillus strain22. Other SSN clusters were not part of gene clusters encoding NRPS machinery (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and are, therefore, unlikely to be involved in prodrug biosynthesis systems.
