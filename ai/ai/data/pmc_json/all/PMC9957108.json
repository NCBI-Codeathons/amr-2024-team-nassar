["Adaptive evolution is a process in which variation that confers an evolutionary advantage in a specific environmental context arises and is propagated through a population. When investigating this process, researchers have mainly focused on describing advantageous phenotypes or putative advantageous genotypes. A recent increase in molecular data accessibility and technological advances has allowed researchers to go beyond description and to make inferences about the mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution. In this systematic review, we discuss articles from 2016 to 2022 that investigated or reviewed the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution in vertebrates in response to environmental variation. Regulatory elements within the genome and regulatory proteins involved in either gene expression or cellular pathways have been shown to play key roles in adaptive evolution in response to most of the discussed environmental factors. Gene losses were suggested to be associated with an adaptive response in some contexts. Future adaptive evolution research could benefit from more investigations focused on noncoding regions of the genome, gene regulation mechanisms, and gene losses potentially yielding advantageous phenotypes. Investigating how novel advantageous genotypes are conserved could also contribute to our knowledge of adaptive evolution.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Vertebrates colonized a broad range of habitats with varying ecological conditions (e.g., lighting conditions, oxygen content, and water salinity). This process was associated with adaptations to these varied environments. Adaptive evolution is a process by which advantageous phenotypes, i.e., traits which increase fitness, are propagated through positive selection or environmentally induced variation [1]. Advantageous traits are determined by evolutionary pressures and habitat dynamics; consequently, a phenotype that is advantageous in certain ecological contexts might be neutral or deleterious in others.", "Vertebrates colonized a broad range of habitats with varying ecological conditions (e.g., lighting conditions, oxygen content, and water salinity).

Genetic variation arises from mutations that can occur due to single base changes, insertions, deletions, and duplications [2]. Mutations can have multiple implications, from pseudogenization to de novo emergence of genes and/or regulatory elements (Figure 1 and Table 1). Mutations can give rise to novel phenotypes, and the advantageous ones become propagated in a population [2]. Thus, functionally important genomic regions are assumed to be highly conserved and adaptive alleles undergo rapid fixation [3,4]. The conserved nature of these functionally important elements can be used to identify them as being adaptive.", "Adaptive evolutionary processes occur in two general steps: (1) variation arises and (2) advantageous phenotype is propagated and maintained in the population.

In bony fishes, the duplication of zona pellucida genes (ZP) has been proposed to play a role in reproduction via external fertilization and by successfully hatching eggs, providing an additional layer of protection under the constraints of the environmental factors [144,145]. Multiple gene-duplication mechanisms have been identified in this process (i.e., genome duplication, gene block duplication, and tandem duplication). Conversely, vertebrates with internal fertilization exhibit signs of relaxed purifying selection, pseudogenization, and subsequent reduction in number of ZP genes [144].", "In platyfish, the duplication of C6AST genes has been associated with the adaptive evolution of internal fertilization and ovoviviparity [13]. In seahorses, the duplication of C6AST arose independently, and it is involved in the evolution of male pregnancy in these fish [13]. The species also exhibits duplication and neofunctionalization of the PASTN genes, which are thought to be involved in the adaptive evolution of internal fertilization [13]. These molecular mechanisms (i.e., gene duplications and neofunctionalization) are also involved in mammalian reproductive adaptations.

Some species of anglerfish have evolved a unique reproductive strategy to overcome challenges in their deep-sea environments: parasitic males. Males in these species have evolved to be parasitic and are permanently attached to the females. Without the necessary immune system adaptations, the parasitism of the male would illicit an immune response in the female, which could potentially kill the males. These adaptations involved mutations impacting the function of immune system proteins (e.g., substrate binding affinity), differential regulation (e.g., reduced expression), and gene losses (e.g., pseudogenization) (MHC and CD gene families) [147].", "The evolution of novel reproductive strategies in response to environmental factors can require adaptations in non-reproductive structures.

MiRs can hybridize with target mRNA and can lead to its decay, thus downregulating gene expression. Sequence variation in regulatory elements can lead to increases (upregulation) or decreases (downregulation) in transcription of a gene. (B). Regulatory mechanisms.
