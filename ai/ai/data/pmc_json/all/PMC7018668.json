The HGF/c-Met axis is involved in cell proliferation, movement, differentiation, invasion, angiogenesis, and apoptosis by activating multiple downstream signaling pathways. In this review, we focus on the function of the HGF/c-Met axis in HCC. The HGF/c-Met axis promotes the onset, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of HCC. Moreover, it can serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a therapeutic target for HCC.

The main cause of HCC is chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis virus B and/or C. However, other factors are also related to the occurrence of HCC, including alcohol-related liver disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and mellitus-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Dyson et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2014). Only about 40% of patients with early-stage or localized HCC are suitable for potentially curative treatments (surgical resection, liver transplantation, and local radiofrequency ablation) and 20% are suitable for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) if in an intermediate stage (Giordano and Columbano, 2014). Due to lack of early effective diagnosis, around 80% patients are diagnosed with advanced HCC. The prognosis of advanced HCC is poor, the median overall survival (OS) time is roughly 1\u20132 months (Ren et al., 2020) and only systemic therapy can improve survival time.", "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the world (Ferlay et al., 2019), and its burden is expected to increase in the next few years.

For sorafenib used in first-line therapy, results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial investigating efficacy of sorafenib in 271 patients with HCC have been reported. The primary endpoint, median OS was 6.5 months for patients with sorafenib and 4.2 months for patients with placebo (Cheng et al., 2009). Another recent study demonstrated that OS was higher in patients treated with sorafenib (10.7 months) than patients who received the placebo (7.9 months) (Llovet et al., 2008). However, the survival benefit of sorafenib was disappointing in clinical trials, owing to its low response rate and short effective duration, caused by intrinsic and acquired resistance (Cheng et al., 2009; Llovet et al., 2015).

(I) Des-\u03b3-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is secreted from HCC cells and activates c-Met because it contains two structural regions that are similar to HGF (Suzuki et al., 2005; Zhang Y.S. et al., 2014). Due to this similarity, DCP can bind to and activate c-Met. Moreover, DCP is used as a tumor screening and diagnostic biomarker owing to its sensitivity and specificity. (II) C-Met is modulated through crosstalk with different membrane receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER), Integrin, \u03b2- catenin, cluster of differentiation-44 (CD44), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Plexin B1, VEGF-A, insulin receptor (INSR), FAS, Mucin 1 (MUC1), neuropilin (Nrp)-1 and -2, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Figure 2; Jo et al., 2015; Garcia-Vilas and Medina, 2018). Although this crosstalk is not necessary for cell survival, it is able to better integrate the signals presented in the extracellular environment. Even if the crosstalk is redundant in physiological conditions, these interacting receptors may collaborate with each other in promoting tumorigenesis and/or metastasis and even cause resistance to target drugs in pathologic conditions. (III) C-Met overexpression drives the receptor activation and is induced by a few factors, including hypoxia (Pennacchietti et al., 2003; Ghiso and Giordano, 2013), inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, activation of upstream oncogenes and loss of miRNAs (Corso and Giordano, 2013). (IV) C-Met mutations can activate the receptor, thereby altering substrate specificity or catalytic activity. The identification of germline activating mutations in hereditary papillary renal carcinomas is unequivocal evidence correlating Met with cancer (Schmidt et al., 1999). (V) C-Met can also be activated by amplification. It has been shown that non-canonical pathways are associated with tumor progression, metastasis (Garcia-Vilas and Medina, 2018) and drug resistance (Migliore and Giordano, 2008; Scagliotti et al., 2013) in in vivo experiments. (VI) Autocrine Met-induced-activation is due to ectopic Met expression in cells yielding HGF, especially in acute myeloid leukemia (Kentsis et al., 2012). (VII) miRNAs directly degrade messenger RNA or repress translation to regulate gene expression (Friedman et al., 2009). Deregulated miRNA expression in HCC tissues has been detected. (VIII) Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could modulate c-Met expression by interacting with miRNAs (Zhang et al., 2019). (IX) Slug can mediate activation of c-Met in a ligand-independent manner because of increased levels of fibronectin and induced integrin \u03b1 V function (Chang et al., 2019).", "The HGF/c-Met axis has an important role in cellular behaviors, such as cell proliferation, migration, survival, morphogenesis and the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Taher et al., 2002; Bouattour et al., 2018). Moreover, it also is essential for liver formation, growth, regeneration, protection, and angiogenesis during embryonic development and in adulthood after injury (Borowiak et al., 2004).

Mutations in the Casitas B-cell lymphoma (Cbl)-binding domain are demonstrated to be oncogenic because binding of Cbl to Y1003 causes Met ubiquitination that is vital to maintenance of physiological Met activation and prevention of continued activation of Met (Abella et al., 2005; Peschard and Park, 2007). Under normal conditions, activated Met is rapidly removed from the cell surface by ubiquitination, and then targets the lysosomal degradation chamber. More and more evidence shows that the ubiquitination of RTK is the key to its lysosomal degradation and recruitment of the ubiquitin protein ligase Cbl family is required for ligand-induced degradation of many RTKs. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Y1003 provides a direct docking site for the SH2-like crystal structure of Cbl (TKB) domain of Cbl ubiquitin ligase and is required for ligand-dependent ubiquitination and Met receptor degradation.

However, another study found that HGF plays a crucial role in HCC proliferation induced by cancer-associated fibroblasts from HCC (H-CAFs) in in vitro and in vivo trials (Jia et al., 2013). Tumor volume growth was consistent with HGF production. Furthermore, the effect of H-CAF conditioned medium on proliferation of HCC cells was significantly reduced by anti-HGF. Therefore, according to these studies, HGF/c-Met can induce proliferation of hepatocellular cells.", "Invasion and Metastasis", "Invasion and Metastasis", "Invasion and Metastasis", "The high lethality of HCC results from primary tumors invading and migrating to other tissues.

Second, as mentioned above, c-Met inhibitors which target the interaction between HGF and c-Met may lose efficacy owing to cell attachment (Wang et al., 2001), gene amplification of c-Met, DCP binding to c-Met (Suzuki et al., 2005), gene mutation in the c-Met activation loop (Okuma and Kondo, 2016) and crosstalk with other membrane receptors (Garcia-Vilas and Medina, 2018).

Sorafenib is a standard therapy for advanced HCC, thus the resistance to sorafenib is a major concerning problem. Firtina Karagonlar et al. (2016) have found that in HCC patients on long term sorafenib treatment, the upregulation of HGF induces autocrine activation of HGF/c-Met signaling pathways, increasing the invasion and migration abilities of HCC cells and leading to resistance to sorafenib. Moreover, a recent study has demonstrated that tumor associated M2 macrophages secret HGF in a feed-forward manner, leading the resistance to sorafenib (Dong et al., 2019). Also, a new study found that HGF activates phosphorylated (P)-ERK/Snail/EMT, P-STAT3/Snail/EMT (Chen et al., 2019) and AKT/ERK1/2-EGR1 (Han et al., 2017; Chen and Xia, 2019; Xiang et al., 2019) signaling pathways to induce the resistance to sorafenib. According to the study of Chen, IncRNA NEAT1 induces sorafenib resistance of HCC patients through repressing miR-335 expression and activation of c-Met-Akt signaling pathway (Chen and Xia, 2019). Thus, the concentration of HGF in serum may be a potential predictive marker for sorafenib efficacy (Shao et al., 2015) and the combination of HGF and c-Met inhibitors and sorefenib could improve the efficacy of the first line systemic treatment (Goyal et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2019). For instance, regorafenib plays a crucial role of reversing HGF-induced sorafenib resistance through the inhibition of the EMT (Chen et al., 2016, 2019). Angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL1) not only inhibits sorafenib resistance, but also inhibits cancer stemness and tumor growth of HCC cells via suppressing the EMT through the Met-AKT/ERK-EGR-1-Slug signaling cascade (Chen et al., 2016).", "Recently, a growing body of evidence suggests that aberrant activation of HGF/c-Met signaling is associated with resistance of target therapies (Corso and Giordano, 2013), including sorafenib.

Moreover, it is also essential for liver formation, growth, regeneration and protection and angiogenesis during embryonic development and in adulthood after injury. Especially in chronic liver diseases, inflammation decreases hepatocytes and increases the need for c-Met activity to promote hepatocyte proliferation, regeneration and suppress inflammation. Nevertheless, the aberrant activation of c-Met and downstream signaling pathways through overexpression of HGF or c-Met, gene amplification, mutational activation of c-Met, down-regulation of Met-targeted miRNA, binding to other ligands, autocrine signaling or abnormally high HGF levels initiates and drives tumorigenesis and promotes tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis in HCC. In the progression of liver cancer, c-Met is regulated by various factors such as miRNAs and SOCS1. Furthermore, c-Met cooperates with other signaling pathways such as MUCI or \u03b2-catenin in promoting tumorigenesis. Therefore, the treatment of liver cancer with c-Met as a target is a potential and promising therapy strategy.
