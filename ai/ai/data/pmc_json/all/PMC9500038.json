["Decades of intense herbicide use has led to resistance in weeds. Without innovative weed management practices and new herbicidal modes of action, the unabated rise of herbicide resistance will undoubtedly place further stress upon food security. HMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase) is the rate limiting enzyme of the eukaryotic mevalonate pathway successfully targeted by statins to treat hypercholesterolemia in humans. As HMGR inhibitors have been shown to be herbicidal, HMGR could represent a mode of action target for the development of herbicides. Here, we present the crystal structure of a HMGR from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtHMG1) which exhibits a wider active site than previously determined structures from different species. This plant conserved feature enables the rational design of specific HMGR inhibitors and we\u00a0develop a tolerance trait through sequence analysis of fungal gene clusters. These results suggest HMGR to be a viable herbicide target modifiable to provide a tolerance trait.", "Managing herbicide resistance problem needs the identification of new herbicidal modes of action. Here, the authors solve the crystal structures of Arabidopsis HMGR and show HMGR as a potential new herbicide target by identifying plant-specific HMGR inhibitors and engineering tolerant trait in Arabidopsis.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "As herbicide resistance continues to rise, the efficacy of herbicides has diminished1 such that new modes of action are desperately needed. Only one new herbicide mode of action has been brought to market in almost 40 years2. Weeds are yet to evolve significant resistance to clomazone and bixlozone1, two herbicides that disrupt isoprenoid biosynthesis by targeting the enzyme 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase3. Found in all kingdoms of life, isoprenoid biosynthesis is crucial for the synthesis of lipids, hormones, vitamins and defence compounds4\u20136. The biosynthetic route differs between kingdoms; most animals, fungi, protists and archaea use a mevalonate (MVA) pathway, whereas most Gram-negative bacteria including cyanobacteria use a methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway7. Through a shared evolutionary history with cyanobacteria, plants use both pathways7\u201311 compartmentalised to the cytosol (MVA) or plastids (MEP)12\u201314. None of the known modes of action for any of the commercial herbicides affect the MVA pathway1.

HMGR regulation appears to be conserved between humans and plants with the N-terminus regulated by ubiquitination whereas catalytic core activity is regulated by phosphorylation7. Many of the regulatory proteins differ, however, and this is further complicated by plants having multiple copies or isoforms plus a wide variety of external signals modifying expression, such as light and herbivory7,27.", "As herbicide resistance continues to rise, the efficacy of herbicides has diminished1 such that new modes of action are desperately needed.

Modelling of atorvastatin along with compounds 4 and 7 into the active site of HsHMGCR revealed a single dominant high-affinity binding mode with a large drop in affinity to the next most favourable binding mode. Atorvastatin exhibited the highest affinity followed by compound 7 and 4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06) consistent with in vitro results (Fig.\u00a04). Modelling with AtHMG1 revealed more varied poses of the analogues, with similar affinities between the most favourable binding modes. These binding modes are possibly facilitated by a wider active site and flexibility in the L\u03b22-L\u03b11 loop region (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c) and might account for the difficulty we had in obtaining co-crystal structures for AtHMG1. The lower affinity for AtHMG1 than HsHMGCR for compounds 4 and 7 suggests further molecular dynamics simulations and crystallographic studies may be necessary to help reveal the molecular basis of in vitro specificity (Fig.\u00a04). Notably, selectivity over HsHMGCR was also obtained by targeting the same L\u03b22-L\u03b11 loop region in Manduca sexta using gem-difluoromethylenated HMGR inhibitors35. Similar derivatives may also prove to be selective for plant HMGRs. Overall, the developed compounds provide a framework for further structure-based rational herbicide design targeting the L\u03b22-L\u03b11 loop region of AtHMG1, which could be validated for selectivity in mammalian in vivo studies. Greater species selectivity might be obtainable by targeting the N-terminal domain of HMGR, which is highly divergent between humans and plants and is absent from class II HMGRs. A recent crystal structure of the regulatory elements that interact with the N-terminal domain in HsHMGCR and studies of compounds that increase HMGR degradation suggest that this could be an alternative mechanism to lower cholesterol levels16,18. Future studies of the regulatory elements interacting with plant HMGR N-terminal domain and complexed crystal structures might in the same way also provide an avenue to develop more species-specific inhibitors of HMGR. The regulatory elements that control plant lipid metabolism might also provide new herbicidal targets, just as the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 and angiopoietin-like 3 are providing new avenues for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia62,63.", "Here, we rationally designed a compound with >20-fold preference for plant HMGR in vitro with limited modification to the parent scaffold. Modelling of atorvastatin along with compounds 4 and 7 into the active site of HsHMGCR revealed a single dominant high-affinity binding mode with a large drop in affinity to the next most favourable binding mode. Atorvastatin exhibited the highest affinity followed by compound 7 and 4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06) consistent with in vitro results (Fig.\u00a04). Modelling with AtHMG1 revealed more varied poses of the analogues, with similar affinities between the most favourable binding modes. These binding modes are possibly facilitated by a wider active site and flexibility in the L\u03b22-L\u03b11 loop region (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c) and might account for the difficulty we had in obtaining co-crystal structures for AtHMG1. The lower affinity for AtHMG1 than HsHMGCR for compounds 4 and 7 suggests further molecular dynamics simulations and crystallographic studies may be necessary to help reveal the molecular basis of in vitro specificity (Fig.\u00a04). Notably, selectivity over HsHMGCR was also obtained by targeting the same L\u03b22-L\u03b11 loop region in Manduca sexta using gem-difluoromethylenated HMGR inhibitors35. Similar derivatives may also prove to be selective for plant HMGRs. Overall, the developed compounds provide a framework for further structure-based rational herbicide design targeting the L\u03b22-L\u03b11 loop region of AtHMG1, which could be validated for selectivity in mammalian in vivo studies. Greater species selectivity might be obtainable by targeting the N-terminal domain of HMGR, which is highly divergent between humans and plants and is absent from class II HMGRs. A recent crystal structure of the regulatory elements that interact with the N-terminal domain in HsHMGCR and studies of compounds that increase HMGR degradation suggest that this could be an alternative mechanism to lower cholesterol levels16,18. Future studies of the regulatory elements interacting with plant HMGR N-terminal domain and complexed crystal structures might in the same way also provide an avenue to develop more species-specific inhibitors of HMGR. The regulatory elements that control plant lipid metabolism might also provide new herbicidal targets, just as the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 and angiopoietin-like 3 are providing new avenues for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia62,63.", "By analysing the AtHMG1 crystal structure and sequences in fungal biosynthetic gene clusters, we identified a mutation conferring statin resistance without adversely affecting catalytic activity. Overexpressing this mutant protein in A. thaliana demonstrated its potential as a tolerance trait, but further investigations are needed. These could include (i) the efficacy of this protein mutant in different species; (ii) optimisation of expression and regulation, by modifying the N-terminal domain; (iii) its effects on sterol levels and seed set64; and (iv) determining what HMGR inhibitor residues remain in the treated crop or soil. Future studies might also focus on other residues that potentially impart resistance, such as the end region of the S\u03b24 strand (residues 387\u2013390), that show conservation in putative resistance genes from Penicillium citrinum and Xylaria grammica and could affect binding of the butyryl group of natural statins.

Crystals used for inhibitor soaks were grown with the additives 40% v/v pentaerythritol ethoxylate (3/4 EO/OH) and 0.1\u2009M iron(III) chloride hexahydrate. Inhibitor soaks were carried out in the same mother-liquor with 1\u2009mg/mL of inhibitors. Single crystals were quickly soaked in mother-liquor containing 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant before being flash frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Data collection was performed at 100\u2009K on the Australian MX2 (micro-focus) beamline69 with 1.9\u2009\u00c5 resolution for the apo form and 2.1\u2009\u00c5 for inhibitor complexed AtHMG1.", "Crystal structure determination, refinement and model building", "Crystal structure determination, refinement and model building", "Crystal structure determination, refinement and model building", "Apo and complexed AtHMG1 diffraction data were processed using XDS and scaled with AIMLESS from CCP470,71.

One of 19 35\u2009S::AtHMG1 lines and 2 of the 14 35\u2009S::AtHMG1-L558T lines had data only for the higher dose range of hygromycin and rosuvastatin. For IC50 determinations, all data were respectively combined from 19 lines of 35\u2009S::AtHMG1, 14 lines of 35\u2009S::AtHMG1-L558T and WT A. thaliana. Growth inhibition at varying concentrations of hygromycin and rosuvastatin were plotted with a four-parameter non-linear regression model using GraphPad Prism 9.", "Reporting summary", "Reporting summary", "Reporting summary", "Further information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.", "Further information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.", "Further information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.", "Supplementary information", "Supplementary information", "Supplementary Information\nReporting Summary", "Supplementary Information\nReporting Summary", "Supplementary Information\nReporting Summary", "Supplementary Information", "Supplementary Information", "Supplementary Information", "Reporting Summary", "Reporting Summary", "Reporting Summary", "Source data", "Source data", "Source Data", "Source Data", "Source Data", "Source Data", "Publisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "Supplementary information", "Supplementary information", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41467-022-33185-0.", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41467-022-33185-0.", "Acknowledgements", "The authors thank Grishma Vadlamani and Yit-Heng Chooi for their helpful comments.
