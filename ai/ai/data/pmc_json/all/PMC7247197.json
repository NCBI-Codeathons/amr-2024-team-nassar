["Aromatic polyketides have attractive biological activities and pharmacological properties. Different from other polyketides, aromatic polyketides are characterized by their polycyclic aromatic structure. The biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides is usually accomplished by the type II polyketide synthases (PKSs), which produce highly diverse polyketide chains by sequential condensation of the starter units with extender units, followed by reduction, cyclization, aromatization and tailoring reactions. Recently, significant progress has been made in characterization and engineering of type II PKSs to produce novel products and improve product titers. In this review, we briefly summarize the architectural organizations and genetic contributions of PKS genes to provide insight into the biosynthetic process. We then review the most recent progress in engineered biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides, with emphasis on generating novel molecular structures. We also discuss the current challenges and future perspectives in the rational engineering of type II PKSs for large scale production of aromatic polyketides.", "Keywords", "Background", "Background", "Polyketides are structurally diverse and biologically active secondary metabolites derived from natural sources such as animals, plants, fungi and bacteria [1]. These compounds are widely used as clinical medicines for the treatment of various acute and chronic diseases [2]. Examples include antibacterial (erythromycin and tetracycline) [3], antitumor (anthracycline and doxorubicin) [4], antifungal (amphotericin and griseofulvin) [5], antiparasitic (avermectin) [6] and anti-cholesterol (lovastatin) [7] drugs. Polyketides are synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) which are multi-domain enzymes or enzyme complexes [8], consisting of acyltransferase (AT), ketosynthase (KS), thioesterase (TE) and optional domains. The biosynthesis of polyketides is initiated by loading the starter unit acyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) on the acyl carrier protein (ACP) catalyzed by the AT domain [2]. The KS domain subsequentially elongates the carbon chain by decarboxylative Claisen condensation. The \u03b2-keto group can be further modified to generate different polyketide structures by additional domains, including ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH) and enoylreductase (ER) domains. Finally, the TE domain hydrolyzes or cyclizes the completed polyketide chain from the ACP-domain to terminate the elongation [9]. Although sharing a similar synthetic process, PKSs can be classified into three types, type I, II, and III PKSs (Fig.\u00a01) [10, 11]. Type I PKSs are multifunctional peptides containing linearly arranged and covalently fused domains. The type I PKSs can be further classified into iterative type I PKSs (iPKSs) (Fig.\u00a01a) and modular type I PKSs (mPKSs) (Fig.\u00a01b) [12]. iPKSs are mainly found in fungi and the domains are used repeatedly to catalyze multiple rounds of elongation [13, 14]. While, mPKSs are primarily found in bacteria and function in an assembly line similar to the nonribosomal peptide synthases [15]. mPKSs consist of several domains with defined functions that are separated by short spacer regions. The distinct domains work cooperatively and non-iteratively to catalyze the carbon chain elongation and functional group regeneration [16]. Type II PKSs are multi-enzyme complexes composed of monofunctional proteins (Fig.\u00a01c). They are found predominantly in bacteria and produce diverse aromatic polyketides [17]. Different from both type I and type II PKSs, type III PKSs are mainly found in plants as simple homodimers that use CoA rather than ACP as an anchor for chain extension (Fig.\u00a01d) [18], while both type II and type III PKSs are iterative.Fig.\u00a01Catalytic reaction of PKSs. a Iterative type I PKSs; b Modular type I PKSs; c Type II PKSs; d Typical type III PKSs use acyl-CoA as the starter unit and malonyl-CoA as the extender unit.

They are an important type of natural products with antibacterial, anticancer and antiviral bioactivities, with representative examples being the above-mentioned drugs tetracyclines and anthracyclines [3, 4]. The clinical and environmental potential of aromatic polyketides has attracted increasing attention from researchers to conduct studies on the biosynthesis of these polyketides. The production process of aromatic polyketides includes the following reactions. (1) \u03b1-Carboxylated precursor loading: acetate is loaded onto ACP, forming acyl-ACP. (2) Iterative chain extension and ketone reduction: acyl-ACP is transferred to the KS subunit and iteratively elongated with the extender unit malonyl-CoA to form the poly-\u03b2-keto chain. (3) Cyclization and/or aromatization: the poly-\u03b2-keto chain is catalyzed by aromatases (ARO) and oxygenases to generate the aromatic polyketide core. (4) Post-modification: oxygenases, methyltransferases and glycosyltransferases catalyze this aromatic polyketide core to generate the final product [17, 20]. The characteristic of aromatic polyketides biosynthesis is the employment of a set of iteratively used enzymes. This set of enzymes is called minimal type II PKS, which contains KS\u03b1, chain length factors (CLF or KS\u03b2) and ACP subunits.

A typical case is the biosynthesis of kinamycins, a group of bacterial polyketide secondary metabolites containing a diazo group [30], which begins with the condensation of 1 acetyl-CoA and 9 malonyl-CoA molecules to form the intermediate dehydrorabelomycin [31]. While only a few type II PKSs have been identified to use other starter units, the employment of different starter units could provide additional structurally diverse products.

The methyltransferases (MTs)-mediated reactions usually transfer a methyl group from a donor such as S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to the C, N or O atoms on acceptor targets. MTs are categorized into C-MTs, O-MTs and N-MTs by which of those atoms are modified. DutMT1, located in the dut gene cluster was identified from S. minoensis NRRL B-5482 by genome sequencing. To further study the function of this gene, aiming gene deletion combined with intermediates identification experiments were performed. This enzyme was then identified as a C-MT that transfers a methyl group to 12-desmethyl-dutomycin to yield dutomycin [72]. Two C-MTs were found to involve in the biosynthesis of polyketomycin (POK), an antitumor aromatic polyketide in S. diastatochromogenes T\u00fc6028 (Fig.\u00a03). PokMT2 is able to methylate the substrate at C6 position, while PokMT1 is responsible for methylation of another intermediate 6-methylsalicylyl-CoA to form 3,6-DMSA moiety of the POK molecule [73] (Fig.\u00a03). In order to understand the reaction process of POK biosynthesis, Guo et al. characterized PokMT2 and an ATP-dependent CoA ligase, PokM3, and provided an unusual way for the generation of POK [74] (Fig.\u00a03).

In order to achieve economically viable production and continually expending the palette of aromatic polyketides, we anticipate the future efforts focused on the following research directions: (1) thorough characterization of catalytic machinery of aromatic polyketides on different levels, such as structural and genetic levels; (2) discovery of more promising aromatic polyketides based on enzyme and gene bioprospecting; (3) production of new aromatic polyketides with improved or novel bioactivities by using combinatorial biosynthesis approach; (4) improvement of catalytic activity of PKSs through protein engineering; (5) exploration and activation of the positive regulatory factor of gene cluster by genetic engineering. We expect that with the continued and rapid development of advanced technologies and tools, more robust and efficient microbial cell factories can be established to achieve economically biosynthesis of type II aromatic polyketides.", "Natural products derived from plants, animals and microorganisms are widely used in food, cosmetic, chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
