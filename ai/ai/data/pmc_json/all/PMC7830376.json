["Clavulanic acid (CA) is an irreversible \u03b2-lactamase enzyme inhibitor with a weak antibacterial activity produced by Streptomyces clavuligerus (S. clavuligerus). CA is typically co-formulated with broad-spectrum \u03b2\u2011lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin, conferring them high potential to treat diseases caused by bacteria that possess \u03b2\u2011lactam resistance. The clinical importance of CA and the complexity of the production process motivate improvements from an interdisciplinary standpoint by integrating metabolic engineering strategies and knowledge on metabolic and regulatory events through systems biology and multi-omics approaches. In the large-scale bioprocessing, optimization of culture conditions, bioreactor design, agitation regime, as well as advances in CA separation and purification are required to improve the cost structure associated to CA production. This review presents the recent insights in CA production by S. clavuligerus, emphasizing on systems biology approaches, strain engineering, and downstream processing.", "1. Introduction", "1.

The clavam pathway contains two sets of reactions: the so-called \u201cearly\u201d and \u201clate\u201d steps. The early steps start with the condensation of the glycolysis intermediate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and the amino acid L-arginine, producing the N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-arginine. This condensation is catalyzed by the N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-arginine synthase (CEAS). The early steps comprise five well-known reactions leading to the (3S, 5S)-clavaminic acid. The formation of the clavaminic acid is considered a bifurcation point of the carbon flowing through the pathway. The CA biosynthesis late steps consider the reactions leading to CA, as well as the reactions forming the clavam 5S compounds after the clavaminic acid bifurcation [24,25,26]. The known reactions of the clavam pathway are summarized in Figure 3. The \u03b2-lactam compound deoxyguanidinoproclavaminic acid is synthesized from the N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-arginine in the second reaction of the clavam pathway, catalyzed by the \u03b2-lactam synthetase (BLS) [27,28,29]. The hydroxylation of the deoxyguanidinoproclavaminic acid takes place to form the guanidinoproclavaminic acid; a reaction mediated by clavaminate synthase (CAS) [29,30,31,32]. Subsequently, the proclavaminic acid is produced by removing the amidino group from the arginine residue on the guanidinoproclavaminic acid, by action of proclavaminate amidino hydrolase (PAH) [33,34]. The dihydroclavaminic acid is obtained from the proclavaminic acid through oxidative cyclization and desaturation, both catalyzed by CAS, leading to the (3S, 5S)-clavaminic acid [29,35]. At this point, the late steps start with the carbon flux bifurcation in two branches: one branch leading to the clavulanate-9-aldehyde and further the CA, and the other branch forming clavam 5S compounds. It is important to highlight that the 3S, 5S stereochemistry of clavaminic acid is conserved in the synthesis of all clavam 5S compounds. In the case of the CA, a transition from 3S, 5S configuration to 3R, 5R is required. Some authors have suggested that this stereochemical inversion may occur via the N-glycyl-clavaminic acid intermediate to form the clavulanate-9-aldehyde with a 3R, 5R configuration, and therefore the CA [36,37]. However, more experimental evidence is required for the complete elucidation of intermediate reactions connecting the clavaminic acid with the clavulanate-9-aldehyde [36,37], which is lastly reduced to CA by the action of clavulanate dehydrogenase (CAD) [38].

Several operation modes and media compositions have been explored aimed to increase the characteristic low titters of the wild type strain, as Ser et al. [55] reviewed recently. Such strategies might also enhance the CA titers of engineered strains in submerged cultivation. As previously mentioned, glycerol is the most common carbon source used in CA production. When comparing the CA production using glycerol and starch as carbon sources, glycerol promotes CA titers up to 5-fold the observed in cultivations with starch as carbon source [56,57]. Nevertheless, substrate inhibition can occur at glycerol concentrations higher than 50 g\u2219L\u22121 [56]. As glycerol acts as the C-3 precursor, the biosynthesis of CA is enhanced by amino acid supplementation [42,58] and rich nitrogen sources like soy protein and soy flour [56,57] that provide abundant C-5 precursors through the urea cycle. Conversely, the use of dextrose or starch promote the secretion of Cephamycin C [57,59]. In a media screening study, Da Silva et al. [60] observed the highest CA production (0.437 g\u2219L\u22121) with the media having glycerol as the main carbon source and isolated soy protein, while the amino acid supplementation did not enhance the CA productivity. Neto et al. [61] reported CA concentrations in batch, fed batch and continuous cultivations of 0.195, 0.404, and 0.293 g\u2219L\u22121, respectively. The highest CA concentrations obtained in bioreactor cultivations using a wild type strain were reported by Teodoro et al. [62]. In that study, batch and fed-batch operation modes were tested using a complex medium prepared with glycerol, malt, and yeast extracts, peptone and trace elements. Batch cultivations yielded 0.430\u20130.530 g\u2219L\u22121 of CA while fed-batch cultivations with ornithine (3.7 g\u2219L\u22121) led to a CA concentration of 1.560 g\u2219L\u22121 [62,63]. A complex culture medium provides important amounts of free or hydrolyzed amino acids, which act not only as nitrogen sources, but also as secondary carbon sources. Complex nitrogen sources, such as those containing soy protein, favor considerably the CA accumulation in contrast to the chemically defined media [56]. The use of complex media with vegetable oils supplementation (olive, cotton, palm, and corn) as secondary carbon sources may enhance the CA production up to 2-fold when compared to glycerol as a supplement [64,65,66]. However, the use of complex media leads to denser and more viscous fermentation broths due to the high concentration of suspended solids. Those factors may affect the mass transfer in the bioreactor and the downstream CA separation. Phosphate has a potential repressive effect on CA production; thus, culture media are commonly designed as phosphate-limited [6,42,55]. In this regard, Saudagar and Singhal [58] found a CA biosynthesis repression when increasing the phosphate concentration in the media over 100 mmol.L\u22121. The studies indicated that CA accumulation is favored in the fed-batch operation under controlled conditions of pH, aeration, and stirring. Those conditions are more easily controllable in stirred tank bioreactors (STR) although the CA production studies are not restricted only to this configuration.", "CA is usually produced in submerged cultivation of S. clavuligerus, either wild type or engineered strains.

Batch cultivations yielded 0.430\u20130.530 g\u2219L\u22121 of CA while fed-batch cultivations with ornithine (3.7 g\u2219L\u22121) led to a CA concentration of 1.560 g\u2219L\u22121 [62,63]. A complex culture medium provides important amounts of free or hydrolyzed amino acids, which act not only as nitrogen sources, but also as secondary carbon sources. Complex nitrogen sources, such as those containing soy protein, favor considerably the CA accumulation in contrast to the chemically defined media [56]. The use of complex media with vegetable oils supplementation (olive, cotton, palm, and corn) as secondary carbon sources may enhance the CA production up to 2-fold when compared to glycerol as a supplement [64,65,66]. However, the use of complex media leads to denser and more viscous fermentation broths due to the high concentration of suspended solids. Those factors may affect the mass transfer in the bioreactor and the downstream CA separation. Phosphate has a potential repressive effect on CA production; thus, culture media are commonly designed as phosphate-limited [6,42,55]. In this regard, Saudagar and Singhal [58] found a CA biosynthesis repression when increasing the phosphate concentration in the media over 100 mmol.L\u22121. The studies indicated that CA accumulation is favored in the fed-batch operation under controlled conditions of pH, aeration, and stirring. Those conditions are more easily controllable in stirred tank bioreactors (STR) although the CA production studies are not restricted only to this configuration.", "Other factors apart from culture media could affect the CA accumulation in submerged cultures of S. clavuligerus. The CA molecule shows high susceptibility to temperature and ionic strength in aqueous solutions, compromising the CA titers during the cultivation [67,68]. The pH conditions seem to affect CA yield, possibly more linked to molecule degradation than biosynthesis inhibition [69]. The highest concentration of CA has been reported at neutral or slightly acidic pH conditions (6.8), regardless of the substrates used in the cultivations [55]. A recent report showed that STR cultures of S. clavuligerus subjected to acid stresses (pH reduction from 6.8 to 6.3 at a rate of 0.1 pH every 6 h) may lead to higher global yields (YCA/X=0.851\u00a0gCA.gx\u22121) [70]. Low temperatures favor the molecule stability; in this regard, higher titers have been reported during operating fermentations at 20 \u00b0C but the growth rate at such temperature is lower than that observed at 28 \u00b0C [70,71].

The reactor geometry, impeller configuration, and velocity of mixing may impact the oxygen availability on the system; it has been demonstrated that higher mixing velocities and turbulence gives better volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficients (kLa), promoting higher specific growth rates [76,78]. The reactor design must be focused on balancing mass and heat transfer with shear rates, as the latter can cause hydrodynamic stress on cells, affecting their growth and productivity.

The shear forces may affect the broth rheology and transport of nutrients as well as the growth rate and morphology expression on Streptomyces species [79,80]. In the case of S. clavuligerus, agitation and aeration are also considered as factors potentially affecting the CA production. An increase of 50% in oxygen transfer in shake flask cultures increased the CA production 2-fold [81]. Regarding the bioreactor operation, Rosa et al. [82] found that intense agitation rates, i.e., 800\u20131000 rpm, favored CA accumulation in STRs. The kLa observed in airlift reactors, operated in the range from 3 to 5 vvm, are rather comparable to those arising in STRs operating in the range of 600 to 1000 rpm; both conditions promote CA accumulation. An analysis of the S. clavuligerus response to shear stress conditions showed that high shear forces (up to 7.5 Pa.s) increase the growth rate, mycelial thinning, and CA production, in comparison with cultivations at low shear forces (<1 Pa.s) [79]. Moreover, the mycelial diameter increased 57% under low shear forces when compared to the morphology at high shear stress (1.44 \u00b5m); suggesting that CA productivity might be affected by the surface\u2013volume ratio, and consequently by the transport rate of nutrients, oxygen, and product release [79]. In summary, high CA concentrations are attained under adequate provision of C-3 and C-5 precursors that increase the carbon flux towards the biosynthetic pathway under phosphate limitation, while maintaining slightly acidic conditions, controlled temperature, high shear rates, and aeration.

This technique allows the biomolecules to be selectively adsorbed in solid materials while minimizing the degradation of the product. Forte et al. [178,179] studied the CA recovery from aqueous solutions by using natural and synthetic zeolites, namely, faujasite-type NaX zeolite (13X) and clinoptilolite\u2013mordenite zeolite (NZ) and their modified cationic forms (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Sr2+), with aperture diameters ranging 0.062 and 0.150 mm. The 13X\u00ad-Na zeolite showed the best CA retention (17.4%) in the equilibrium at a zeolite/liquid ratio of 0.5 mg.g\u22121 [178].

[180,181] studied the temperature effect on CA adsorption and desorption in flask-scale experiments, showing that CA removal from aqueous solution is very favorable (retention values between 60 and 70%) at temperatures ranging from 5 to 10 \u00b0C given the exothermicity of the CA-resin bonding. The desorption process is facilitated by higher temperatures (up to 30 \u00b0C) than the adsorption, the equilibrium time is almost doubled and the desorption ratio is about 60% [180,181]. Almeida et al. [182] proposed a simultaneous adsorption/desorption system of CA using sequential stirred tanks, allowing the recycling of the fermentation supernatants and hence, increasing the CA adsorption percentages. Absorption operations in packed columns with IRA 400 operating at a flow rate of 0.3 L\u2219h\u22121 and 10 \u00b0C were used, followed by desorption with 2% NaCl at 30 \u00b0C.
