However, the increase in multidrug resistant bacteria is rapidly reducing the effectiveness of our current arsenal of ribosome-targeting antibiotics, highlighting the need for the discovery of compounds with new scaffolds that bind to novel sites on the ribosome. One possible avenue for the development of new antimicrobial agents is by characterization and optimization of ribosome-targeting peptide antibiotics. Biochemical and structural data on ribosome-targeting peptide antibiotics illustrates the large diversity of scaffolds, binding interactions with the ribosome as well as mechanism of action to inhibit translation. The availability of high-resolution structures of ribosomes in complex with peptide antibiotics opens the way to structure-based design of these compounds as novel antimicrobial agents.", "The ribosome and translation as an antibiotic target", "The ribosome and translation as an antibiotic target", "The ribosome is one of the most conserved and sophisticated macromolecular machines of the cell. It is composed of two unequal subunits, a small 30S and large 50S in bacteria, which join together to form a 70S ribosome. While each ribosomal subunit contains a large number of ribosomal proteins, it is the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that plays the most critical functional role defining the ribosome as a ribozyme (Nissen et al., 2000). The small subunit decodes the genetic information delivered by messenger RNA (mRNA), whereas the large subunit hosts the catalytic peptidyl transferase center (PTC), where amino acids delivered by transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are linked into polypeptides (reviewed in Arenz and Wilson, 2016). The ribosome provides a platform for binding of the mRNA and transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The tRNAs have two functional ends, one carrying the amino acid and the other end containing the anticodon that recognizes the codon of the mRNA. The ribosome has three tRNA binding sites: the aminoacyl (A), peptidyl (P), and exit (E) sites. The A site binds the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA), the P site binds the peptidyl-tRNA carrying the nascent polypeptide chain and the E site binds deacylated tRNA before it dissociates from the ribosome. For translation to proceed efficiently, many protein factors are needed, which sequentially guide the ribosome through the protein synthesis cycle (Figure 1). Translation is initiated on the 30S subunit with the help of initiation factors that recruit the initiator formyl-methionine tRNA (fMet-tRNAifMet) to the ribosomal P site where it recognizes the start codon of the mRNA. The 50S subunit associates with the 30S, forming the 70S initiation complex that is primed for the elongation phase of protein synthesis. The second codon of the open reading frame located in the A site of the ribosome is decoded by the ternary complex, composed of aa-tRNA, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and GTP. Decoding of the A-site codon by a cognate aa-tRNA triggers GTP hydrolysis on EF-Tu and release of the aa-tRNA into the A site. The CCA-3\u2032 terminus of aa-tRNA can then accommodate into the PTC of the 50S subunit, and the peptidyl transferase reaction occurs spontaneously extending the nascent peptide chain by one amino acid residue. As the polypeptide is synthesized it passes through a tunnel on the large ribosomal subunit. The function of this exit tunnel appears to be not only to provide an unobstructed passage through the ribosome for newly synthesized polypeptide chains but in many cases to regulate translation itself. Specific elements within the tunnel monitor the amino acid sequence of the nascent polypeptide chain and can arrest translation in response to particular co-factors, such as drugs or metabolites (Ito and Chiba, 2013; Wilson et al., 2016). Following peptide bond formation, translocation of mRNA and tRNAs is catalyzed by the elongation factor EF-G. Translocation by EF-G shifts the deacylated tRNA from the P site to the E site and the peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site. The elongation cycle of EF-Tu delivery of aa-tRNAs and subsequent translation by EF-G is repeated until a stop codon enters the A site. Release factors (RFs), such as RF1 and RF2, recognize the stop codon and promote hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site, releasing the newly synthesized protein from the ribosome. The 70S ribosome is then recycled into individual subunits by the concerted action of EF-G and the ribosome recycling factor (RRF; Figure 1).", "The ribosome is one of the most conserved and sophisticated macromolecular machines of the cell.

Binding of the tuberactinomycins within h44 requires nucleotides A1492 and A1493 to adopt a flipped-out conformation (Figures 6C,D; Stanley et al., 2010), as observed during decoding of aa-tRNA in the A-site (Ogle et al., 2003).

A pre-translocation complex with A/P and P/E hybrid site tRNAs and EF-G trapped by viomycin has been visualized by cryo-electron microscopy (Brilot et al., 2013).", "Viomycin and capreomycin are cyclic pentapeptide antibiotics containing several non-canonical amino acids (Figure 6A), which are produced by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) found in various Streptomyces species (Thomas et al., 2003). Viomycin and capreomycin are members of the tuberactinomycin family and display excellent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including multidrug resistant strains (Jain and Dixit, 2008). Tuberactinomycins have a single binding site on the ribosome that spans the ribosomal interface between h44 of the small 30S subunit and H69 of the large 50S subunit (Figure 6B; Stanley et al., 2010). Binding of the tuberactinomycins within h44 requires nucleotides A1492 and A1493 to adopt a flipped-out conformation (Figures 6C,D; Stanley et al., 2010), as observed during decoding of aa-tRNA in the A-site (Ogle et al., 2003). This explains why the affinity of viomycin to the ribosome greatly increases upon binding of an A-site tRNA (Holm et al., 2016). Although the crystal structures of viomycin (and capreomycin) were on non-rotated ribosomes, biophysical studies indicate that viomycin stabilizes a rotated conformation of the ribosome with hybrid A/P- and P/E-tRNAs (Peske et al., 2004; Shoji et al., 2006; Ermolenko et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2007; Cornish et al., 2008; Ly et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012). Thus, viomycin inhibits translation by trapping the ribosome in an intermediate state on the translocation pathway and can therefore be considered as a translocation inhibitor, as originally proposed in the 1970\u2032s (Liou and Tanaka, 1976; Modolell and Vazquez, 1977).

In this binding site, ODLs simultaneously interact with the 16S rRNA as well as with the anticodon loop of the A-site tRNA. Interaction between the ODL and A-site tRNA increases the affinity of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, resulting in a decreased accuracy of translation and impeded progression of the ribosome along the mRNA (Figure 7C; Pantel et al., 2018). Although, several classes of antibiotics also target the ribosomal decoding center, the binding site of ODLs is distinct from those of other inhibitors, such as tetracycline and negamycin as well as the tuberactinomycins and aminoglycosides (Figure 7D). Despite this, the overall mechanism of action of ODLs is conceptually similar to that of the aminoglycosides or negamycin, whose mode of translation inhibition depends on the drug concentration. At lower concentrations, these antibiotics induce amino acid misincorporation by reducing the fidelity of decoding, whereas at higher concentrations they interfere with translocation (Wang et al., 2012; Olivier et al., 2014; Polikanov et al., 2014; Pantel et al., 2018). Both activities likely reflect a tighter binding of the tRNA in the A site induced by the ODL.

Interaction between the ODL and A-site tRNA increases the affinity of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, resulting in a decreased accuracy of translation and impeded progression of the ribosome along the mRNA (Figure 7C; Pantel et al., 2018). Although, several classes of antibiotics also target the ribosomal decoding center, the binding site of ODLs is distinct from those of other inhibitors, such as tetracycline and negamycin as well as the tuberactinomycins and aminoglycosides (Figure 7D). Despite this, the overall mechanism of action of ODLs is conceptually similar to that of the aminoglycosides or negamycin, whose mode of translation inhibition depends on the drug concentration. At lower concentrations, these antibiotics induce amino acid misincorporation by reducing the fidelity of decoding, whereas at higher concentrations they interfere with translocation (Wang et al., 2012; Olivier et al., 2014; Polikanov et al., 2014; Pantel et al., 2018).

In summary, the action of streptogramins is likely to block both A and P sites, and therefore function during initiation step (Figure 1) or by inducing peptidyl-tRNA drop-off at an early elongation step (Figure 1).", "A unique property of the streptogramin antibiotics is that groups A and B compounds act synergistically in vivo and in vitro, such that binding of the SA compound promotes the binding of the corresponding SB compound (Parfait et al., 1978). Due to this synergistic action, the concentration of each of the compounds in the mixture required to achieve the inhibitory action is significantly lower than the concentration of each of the compounds when they are used separately (Champney, 2001). The synergistic action also allows streptogramins to overcome some resistance mutations (Vannuffel et al., 1992; Canu and Leclercq, 2001). Moreover, by combining some SA and SB compounds it is possible to convert a bacteriostatic effect into a bactericidal lethality. The basis for the synergy between SA and SB is likely related to a rotation of nucleotide A2062 of the 23S rRNA that was observed upon binding of SA compounds to the PTC (Hansen et al., 2003; Harms et al., 2004; Tu et al., 2005; Noeske et al., 2014; Osterman et al., 2017).

As suggested by their name, PrAMPs are AMPs rich in proline, but also contain many arginine residues. PrAMPs are products of the innate immune system and provide a first line of defense against invading bacteria. To date, PrAMPs have been found in many arthropods, such as insects and crustaceans, as well as in some mammals, such as cows, pigs, goats and sheep (Scocchi et al., 2011; Graf et al., 2017). PrAMPs are usually synthesized as inactive pre-pro-peptides that are matured via protease cleavage to yield the active PrAMP peptides. Non-lytic PrAMPs display excellent activity against Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, but are generally less active against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis. This specificity is due to the fact that the uptake of PrAMPs occurs predominantly via the SbmA transporter (Mattiuzzo et al., 2007), but can also utilize the YjiL-MdtM transport system (Krizsan et al., 2015), which are present in most Gram-negative bacteria, but lacking in Gram-positive bacteria. Indeed, resistance to PrAMPs can arise due to deletion or mutation of the SbmA and MdtM transporters (Mattiuzzo et al., 2007; Krizsan et al., 2015; Seefeldt et al., 2015; Florin et al., 2017; Mardirossian et al., 2018). It should be noted that the mammalian PrAMPs, such as Bac7, are generally longer (~60 aa) than insect PrAMPs (~20 aa) and these additional C-terminal residues promote membrane permeabilization (Skerlavaj et al., 1990; Podda et al., 2006), suggesting a dual mode of uptake and action for these PrAMPs.", "Unlike most antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which kill bacteria by disrupting the bacterial membrane, the subclass of proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) can pass through the bacterial membrane without damaging it and instead inhibit bacterial growth by targeting intracellular processes, such as protein synthesis (Casteels and Tempst, 1994; Mattiuzzo et al., 2007; Seefeldt et al., 2016; Graf et al., 2017).
