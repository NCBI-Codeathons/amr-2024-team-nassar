["Azinomycin B is a hybrid polyketide/nonribosomal peptide natural product and possesses antitumor activity by interacting covalently with duplex DNA and inducing interstrand crosslinks. In the biosynthetic study of azinomycin B, a gene (orf1) adjacent to the azinomycin B gene cluster was found to be essential for the survival of the producer, Streptomyces sahachiroi ATCC33158. Sequence analyses revealed that Orf1 belongs to the HTH_42 superfamily of conserved bacterial proteins which are widely distributed in pathogenic and antibiotic-producing bacteria with unknown functions. The protein exhibits a protective effect against azinomycin B when heterologously expressed in azinomycin-sensitive strains. EMSA assays showed its sequence nonspecific binding to DNA and structure-specific binding to azinomycin B-adducted sites, and ChIP assays revealed extensive association of Orf1 with chromatin in vivo. Interestingly, Orf1 not only protects target sites by protein\u2013DNA interaction but is also capable of repairing azinomycin B-mediated DNA cross-linking. It possesses the DNA glycosylase-like activity and specifically repairs DNA damage induced by azinomycin B through removal of both adducted nitrogenous bases in the cross-link. This bifunctional protein massively binds to genomic DNA to reduce drug attack risk as a novel DNA binding protein and triggers the base excision repair system as a novel DNA glycosylase.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Azinomycin B is a promising antitumor natural product isolated from the soil-dwelling bacteria Streptomyces sahachiroi and Streptomyces griseofuscus (1,2). This new structural class of dual alkylating agents is highly effective against tumor cells by interacting covalently with duplex DNA in the major groove and inducing interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) at 5\u2032-GNC or 5\u2032-GNT sequences (3\u20135). Due to the damage effects of alkylation and cross-linking (Supplementary Figure S1), DNA replication is interrupted and ultimately cell death occurs. The unprecedented azabicyclic ring system and highly active epoxide moiety in azinomycin B are two primary electrophilic functional groups responsible for the ICL process (6). Covalent ICLs arise from nucleophilic opening of the aziridine at C-10 and the epoxide at C-21 by the N-7 position of purine residues located on the two DNA strands (4,7). In addition, the naphthoate moiety, along with other functional groups within the skeleton of the compound, may also serve to influence the efficiency of ICL formation (8\u201311). Azinomycin B shows a strong propensity to alkylate guanine nucleosides in the major groove of DNA. On the basis of an average G+C content of 70%, there may be a large number of potentially susceptible target sites within the genome of a streptomycete strain. Obviously, efficient cellular self-protection is crucial for azinomycin B producers to protect themselves from the lethal effects of the compound.", "Azinomycin B is a promising antitumor natural product isolated from the soil-dwelling bacteria Streptomyces sahachiroi and Streptomyces griseofuscus (1,2).

Considering that a single DNA damage is sufficient to cause cell death, multiple modes of resistance determinants are often adopted to ensure efficient self-protection toward a DNA-targeting antibiotic in its producers. For example, two resistance genes, blmA and blmB, were found to protect the bleomycin-producing strain Streptomyces verticillus from DNA damage induced by this cytotoxic agent through drug binding and drug inactivation via acetylation, respectively (13). The important antitumor antibiotic mitomycin C is produced by Streptomyces lavendulae as an inert prodrug that requires enzymatic or chemical reduction to generate a highly effective alkylating agent. Mitomycin self-resistance occurs via three cellular mechanisms: a flavoenzyme (McrA) that oxidizes the active reduced form of mitomycin C (14), a drug binding protein (Mrd) that prevents reductive activation of the prodrug and a membrane-associated protein (Mct) involved in drug efflux (15,16).", "Mechanisms of cellular self-protection mainly include target sites modification, drug inactivation, drug binding and export pumps (12).

The azinomycin B biosynthetic gene cluster in S. sahachiroi was reported in 2008. Its biosynthetic pathway, however, is still not completely understood. To date, only the enzymatic cascade leading to the formation of the naphthoate moiety has been unequivocally deciphered (17,18). Since many of the proposed enzymes and reactions are novel, cloning and characterization of correlative genes will contribute to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of its biosynthesis, self-resistance and regulation. Recently, one locus (aziR) far away from the azinomycin B gene cluster was identified to mediate azinomycin resistance in S. sahachiroi. The aziR gene encodes an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase which normally inactivates antibiotics via phosphorylation, but here it behaves as an azinomycin B binding protein conferring azinomycin resistance (19).", "It is common that antibiotic biosynthetic genes are clustered with resistance and regulator genes.

However, a single sharp retardation band of a site-specific protein\u2013DNA complex appeared when the adducted ODN with a single azinomycin B cross-linking site of GCC was incubated with lower concentration of Orf1 (lanes 1\u20133 in Figure\u00a03B). As protein concentration increased, the amount of the specific protein\u2013DNA complex initially increased (lanes 1 and 2) and then decreased (lanes 3\u20135) due to the sequence non-specific binding of extra Orf1 to other sites.

If Orf1 serves to protect chromatin against azinomycin B, it should be in abundance. Therefore, we measured cellular Orf1 levels at different stages in the life cycle of ATCC33158 by quantitative immunoblotting (Supplementary Figure S6A). In western blot analysis, expression of Orf1 was undetectable or only found in trace amounts in the early growth phase, but rose sharply after 24 h and reached a peak at 36 h. Subsequently, levels dipped slightly from 48 h to 60 h and came back up at 72 h (Supplementary Figure S6B). It is reasonable that the initial and then increasing production of Orf1 apparently preceded azinomycin B production to serve as a protector during drug production (Supplementary Figure S6C).

The Orf1 (40.8 kDa) constituted \u22480.18% of the total protein levels (Supplementary Table S6). If we translated this into molecules per cell, however, there were about 106 molecules of Orf1/cell, approximately on par with the number of target sites.

Intercalative binding of azinomycin B to duplex DNA unwinds the double helix and relaxes the tight conformation, resulting in a slower DNA migration through a gel (27,28). As seen in Figure 4D, the rate of DNA migration was inversely proportional to the level of cross-linking. The supercoiled DNA as well as the ocDNA was progressively relaxed by increased azinomycin B and migrated in agarose gel at continuously decreasing rates. When Orf1 was supplemented, most of cross-linked DNA was repaired and exhibited the same mobility as ocDNA except a little bit left in lane 5 due to insufficiency of the repair enzyme (Figure 4E). The residual highly cross-linked DNA was also effectively converted into the similar conformation of ocDNA after incubation with a raised concentration of Orf1 (Figure 4F, lane 3), indicating that Orf1 specifically repaired the azinomycin B modified DNA. The reverse of cross-linking was protein concentration-dependent, which produced progressively faster migrating products as the Orf1 concentrations increased (Supplementary Figure S7B).

Moreover, the prolonged treatment of ICL DNA with higher concentration of Orf1 caused breaks in DNA strands (Supplementary Figure S7C, lane 5).

Orf1 may confer the azinomycin resistance through drug binding (a), site protection (b) and/or DNA repair (c).

Among them, NER is the most common mechanism that could remove ICL lesions induced by a variety of antitumor antibiotics such as anthramycin and mitomycin C (33,34) by using the UvrABC endonuclease enzyme complex in E. coli cells. The excision of the adducted nucleotide is performed with the UvrA recognizing the helix-distorting lesion, the UvrB unwinding the damaged region, and the UvrC cleaving the phosphodiester bonds near the lesion (35,36). An additional matter of interest is that UvrA and UvrB proteins are capable of repairing the helix-stabilizing anthramycin-N2 guanine DNA adducts in an alternative way: UvrA coupled with UvrB strongly binds DNA and releases DNA-bound anthramycin without incision of DNA (37). A few homologs of UvrA proteins are found to confer self-resistance toward DNA-targeting drugs in antibiotics-producing bacteria. For example, UvrA-like proteins derived from chromomycin A3 (38) and the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 (39) biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported to participate in self-resistance of the corresponding drugs. The daunorubicin resistance protein (DrrC) in Streptomyces peucetius was speculated to bind within DNA regions intercalated by daunorubicin and release pre-bound drug to prevent DNA damage, due to its sequence homology and similar DNA binding properties with UvrA. The drrC, as well as orf1, is vital to self-resistance and antibiotic production. Moreover, as previously reported, inactivation of drrC was only accomplished in non-antibiotic-producing conditions. The DNA binding activity of DrrC is mediated by ATP and enhanced by daunorubicin (DNR) (40,41), while interaction of Orf1 and DNA is independent of ATP and unaffected by azinomycin B (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S4A).", "To our knowledge, three mechanisms exist to repair DNA alkylating/cross-linking damages (Figure 6B).

For example, UvrA-like proteins derived from chromomycin A3 (38) and the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 (39) biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported to participate in self-resistance of the corresponding drugs. The daunorubicin resistance protein (DrrC) in Streptomyces peucetius was speculated to bind within DNA regions intercalated by daunorubicin and release pre-bound drug to prevent DNA damage, due to its sequence homology and similar DNA binding properties with UvrA. The drrC, as well as orf1, is vital to self-resistance and antibiotic production. Moreover, as previously reported, inactivation of drrC was only accomplished in non-antibiotic-producing conditions. The DNA binding activity of DrrC is mediated by ATP and enhanced by daunorubicin (DNR) (40,41), while interaction of Orf1 and DNA is independent of ATP and unaffected by azinomycin B (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S4A).", "Pyrimidine dimers and many of alkylation lesions are commonly repaired by direct reversal as the second repair mechanism in Figure 6B, but which is rarely seen in the removal of DNA ICL and drug self-resistance (42). The last but particularly important mechanism is BER, which repairs small, non-helix distorting base lesions like oxidation, alkylation and deamination (43). Recently, YtKR2, a DNA glycosylase homologous protein, was first reported to confer self-resistance toward a DNA-targeting antibiotic by triggering the BER system (44), which removes N3-YTM-alkylated adenine from monoadduct induced by yatakemycin (YTM). Shortly afterward, our study also found out the Orf1 protein, involved in self-resistance to azinomycin B, possesses DNA glycosylase-like activity. BER is normally initiated by DNA glycosylases and further processed by AP endonucleases. Monofunctional glycosylases only remove damaged base by cleaving the N-glycoside bond to liberate an AP site, whereas bifunctional glycosylases possess an extra AP lyase activity that hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond 3\u2032 to the AP site. Orf1 is supposed to be a novel type of monofunctional glycosylases because it only catalyzed base excision in ICL DNA cleavage assay in vitro. Orf1 specifically recognizes interstrand azinomycin B-DNA crosslinks and removes modified bases located on the two DNA strands, forming apurinic (AP) sites. The ubiquitous AP endonucleases in cells cleave the phosphodiester bond near the AP site to generate a 3\u2032 hydroxyl group adjacent to 5\u2032 deoxyribosephosphate (dRP). DNA polymerase then removes the damaged region using its 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activity and resynthesizes the missing part using the complementary strand as a template. Considering that BER is usually implicated in the elimination of mono-functional alkylation, we speculate that removal of monoadducts prior to crosslink formation seems to be more rational within the cell.", "Pyrimidine dimers and many of alkylation lesions are commonly repaired by direct reversal as the second repair mechanism in Figure 6B, but which is rarely seen in the removal of DNA ICL and drug self-resistance (42).

As a protein has the typical domain architecture of HTH_42, Orf1 is the first member of this superfamily to have a defined biological function in bacterial self-resistance identified. Contrary to most regulatory proteins with HTH motifs, we have shown Orf1 binds to DNA irrespective of any particular sequence. This kind of DNA binding pattern is commonly observed in nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) including histone-like DNA-binding proteins (HLPs) and high-mobility group proteins (HMGs) (45\u201347). The E. coli HU protein, a well-documented NAP, binds linear DNA fragments with low affinity and this binding was only detectable in vitro under low salt conditions (48,49). High concentration of NaCl (up to 150 mM), however, had no effect on the formation and mobility of the Orf1-DNA complex (Supplementary Figure S4B). Moreover, HU protein was found to bind specifically to DNA recombination and repair intermediates with high affinity although it binds to DNA duplex without sequence specificity. This structure-specific manner also occurred in the binding of Orf1 to the azinomycin B modified DNA. NAPs are usually considered to be involved in all DNA-dependent functions, including replication, repair, recombination and gene regulation (50). A novel bifunctional NAP identified in Streptomyces has recently been shown to modulate DNA conformation and transcription during development and stress (47). There were no obvious difference in phenotypic characteristics of colony morphology, spore formation and growth rate between the non-azinomycin-producing strain \u0394aziU3 and the orf1 gene deletion mutant strain \u0394aziU3\u0394orf1 observed.
