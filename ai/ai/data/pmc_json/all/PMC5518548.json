It has proved effective in in vivo infection models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and continues to attract interest as a template for drug discovery. We have used a comparative genomics approach to uncover the (hitherto elusive) biosynthetic pathway to TLM and related thiotetronates. Analysis of the whole-genome sequence of Streptomyces olivaceus T\u00fc 3010 producing the more ramified thiotetronate T\u00fc 3010 provided initial evidence that such thiotetronates are assembled by a novel iterative polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase, and revealed the identity of other pathway enzymes, encoded by adjacent genes. Subsequent genome sequencing of three other thiotetronate-producing actinomycetes, including the Lentzea sp. ATCC 31319 that produces TLM, confirmed that near-identical clusters were also present in these genomes. In-frame gene deletion within the cluster for T\u00fc 3010 from Streptomyces thiolactonus NRRL 15439, or within the TLM cluster, led to loss of production of the respective thiotetronate, confirming their identity. Each cluster houses at least one gene encoding a KASI/II enzyme, suggesting plausible mechanisms for self-resistance. A separate genetic locus encodes a cysteine desulfurase and a (thiouridylase-like) sulfur transferase to supply the sulfur atom for thiotetronate ring formation. Transfer of the main T\u00fc 3010 gene cluster (stu gene cluster) into Streptomyces avermitilis led to heterologous production of this thiotetronate, showing that an equivalent sulfur donor can be supplied by this host strain. Mutational analysis of the T\u00fc 3010 and TLM clusters has revealed the unexpected role of a cytochrome P450 enzyme in thiotetronate ring formation. These insights have allowed us to propose a mechanism for sulfur insertion, and have opened the way to engineering of the biosynthesis of TLM and other thiotetronates to produce novel analogues.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The advent of rapid next-generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized the search for chemical diversity from antibiotic-producing micro-organisms. Actinomycete genomes (6\u201312 Mbp) have been revealed to encode very large numbers of biosynthetic gene clusters,1,2 and sophisticated bioinformatic tools are available to assist the assignment of the products of each encoded pathway to particular structural classes.3 The link between the sequence of the genes and the chemical structure of the product is particularly clear for pathways utilizing giant assembly-line synthases to produce complex reduced polyketides or nonribosomally-determined peptides.4,5 However, there remain a number of valuable chemotypes whose biosynthetic pathways are obscure, and also many orphan clusters whose potentially novel products remain to be elucidated. Methods for systematic analysis of the entire complement of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in a strain remain cumbersome and slow. We describe here an efficacious way of targeting a sought-after biosynthetic pathway, by sequencing several strains producing compounds from the same structural class. This effectively harnesses the accumulated knowledge from decades of conventional natural product screening and structure determination, and significantly reduces the time taken to identify and validate the involvement of the genes and enzymes concerned.

Two independent cosmids, 8G11 and 19H12 (Fig. 3) whose inserts comfortably encompass the annotated stu cluster, were separately introduced into the host by conjugation. As shown in Fig. 3, the recombinant S. avermitilis gained the ability to produce T\u00fc 3010 at levels comparable to those produced by S. thiolactonus NRRL 15439, clearly demonstrating that thiotetronate biosynthesis relies on hijacking of a sulfur supply mechanism from primary metabolism. Cosmid 8G11 was then specifically engineered, using a newly-developed system for in vitro CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing (which we refer to as ICE),52 to reduce the insert to exactly the limits of the annotated gene cluster for T\u00fc 3010, extending from stuE (asparagine synthase-like enzyme) to stuF2 (3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase). LC-ESI-HRMS analysis of fermentation extracts of S. avermitilis housing truncated 8G11, which is referred to as pWHU2702 (Fig. 3) showed that this recombinant strain also produces essentially the same level T\u00fc 3010 as does wild-type S. thiolactonus NRRL 15439, demonstrating that all enzymes essential for thiotetronate synthesis are likely to be encoded within this region.", "Fig. 3Heterologous expression of T\u00fc 3010 biosynthetic genes in S. avermitilis MA-4680.

In many cases the enzymatic machinery is shared with or borrowed from primary metabolic pathways for sulfur delivery.48,51 In the case of leinamycin, however, it has been recently shown that a cysteine desulfurase domain integrated into the assembly-line multienzyme is responsible for sulfur insertion.58 The comparative genomics approach used here has provided the first detailed insights into the novel enzymatic machinery for assembly of thiotetronates, including the nature of the sulfur donors. The PKS-NRPS multienzyme contains only one PKS extension module rather than the three expected from the chemical structure, partly explaining why thiotetronate gene clusters have eluded detection until now. The multienzyme also features domains predicted to tether cysteine, an arrangement perhaps serving to sequester this sulfur donor and channel sulfur more effectively towards thiotetronate biosynthesis. We propose a mechanism for sulfur insertion and thiolactone formation involving an epoxide intermediate. Efforts to detect this and other enzyme-bound intermediates are in progress. The stage is also now set for reconstitution of these pathways in vitro, investigation of the structure and mechanism of key enzymes, and manipulation of the genes in vivo to produce analogues of potential therapeutic value.", "Polyketide natural products containing sulfur include a number of interesting and valuable chemotypes, and prominent among these are the anticancer prodrug leinamycin,57 the thiosugar-containing antibiotic BE-7585,51 and the thiotetronates.
