["Animal manure comprises an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but the variation in ARGs during anaerobic digestion at various temperatures and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. Thus, we performed anaerobic digestion using dairy manure at three temperature levels (moderate: 20\u2009\u00b0C, mesophilic: 35\u2009\u00b0C, and thermophilic: 55\u2009\u00b0C), to analyze the dynamics of ARGs and bacterial communities by quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that 8/10 detected ARGs declined and 5/10 decreased more than 1.0 log during thermophilic digestion, whereas only four and five ARGs decreased during moderate and mesophilic digestion, respectively. The changes in ARGs and bacterial communities were similar under the moderate and mesophilic treatments, but distinct from those in the thermophilic system. Potential pathogens such as Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Corynebacterium were removed by thermophilic digestion but not by moderate and mesophilic digestion. The bacterial community succession was the dominant mechanism that influenced the variation in ARGs and integrons during anaerobic digestion. Thermophilic digestion decreased the amount of mesophilic bacteria (Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria) carrying ARGs. Anaerobic digestion generally decreased the abundance of integrons by eliminating the aerobic hosts of integrons (Actinomycetales and Bacilli). Thermophilic anaerobic digestion is recommended for the treatment and reuse of animal manure.", "As an emerging contaminant, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have become a great public health concern123. In particular, animal manure is an important reservoir of antibiotics and ARGs due to the overuse of antibiotics in the livestock industry456. Accumulating evidence suggests that the increased antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is related to the application of manure and manure-derived fertilizer to land789. Thus, biotechnologies such as anaerobic digestion and aerobic compost may be employed as remedial measures to reduce the abundance of ARGs and pathogens prior to the application of animal manure to land101112.", "A few studies suggest that anaerobic digestion can potentially eliminate some of ARGs131415. The mesophilic anaerobic digestion could significantly reduce cefazolin resistant bacteria14, and ARGs ermB, aphA2 and blaTEM-115. The relative abundances (RAs) of tet and erm in swine manure declined by 1\u20133 orders of magnitude during anaerobic storage12. Temperature is an important parameter during anaerobic digestion and changes in temperature can have variable effects on biogas production16, ARGs17, and microbial community succession18. Diverse results have been obtained in various studies of the effects of temperature on ARGs during anaerobic digestion. Thus, Ghosh et al.13 and Diehl and LaPara17 suggested that thermophilic digestion performed better at reducing ARGs than mesophilic anaerobic digestion. Ma et al.19 found that thermophilic digestion was more effective than mesophilic digestion at decreasing the ermB, ermF, tetO, and tetW genes, but its performance was similar or worse in decreasing other ARGs and intI1. A recent metagenomic analysis by Zhang et al.20 detected no obvious differences in the total ARGs under thermophilic and mesophilic digestion. It should be noted that all of these studies were conducted using wastewater sludge, the effects of temperature on ARGs in animal manure were not studied. Due to the huge differences in physicochemical properties, antibiotic types and concentrations, and microbial community composition in wastewater sludge and animal manure212223, it is highly likely that different effects on ARGs may be obtained by the anaerobic digestion of livestock manure. In addtion, the dynamics of ARGs during anaerobic digestion have received little study, and the underlying mechanism responsible for the variation in ARGs are not fully revealed.", "Bacteria are the main carriers of ARGs and the changes in the bacterial community may lead to variations in the abundance of ARGs. Thus, we hypothesized that changes in the bacterial community comprise the main mechanism responsible for variation in ARGs during anaerobic digestion, where different temperatures will shape distinct bacterial communities with diverse effects on ARGs. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to compare the variation of ARGs in dairy manure under moderate (20\u2009\u00b0C), mesophilic (35\u2009\u00b0C), and thermophilic (55\u2009\u00b0C) anaerobic digestion; and (2) to explore the relationships among the chemical properties, bacterial communities, and ARGs during anaerobic digestion.
