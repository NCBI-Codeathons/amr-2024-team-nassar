In this review, we summarize the information about the structure, biosynthesis, and modes of action of translation inhibiting ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Azol(in)e-containing RiPPs are known to target translation, and several new compounds inhibiting the ribosome have been characterized recently. We performed a systematic search for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of azol(in)e-containing RiPPs. This search uncovered several groups of clusters that likely direct the synthesis of novel compounds, some of which may be targeting the ribosome.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Antibiotics are extensively used worldwide in healthcare, agriculture, and food preservation. However, development and the spread of resistance to most antibiotics discovered during the second half of the 20th century in the course of the so-called \u201cgolden era of antibiotics\u201d has become a global threat (Brown and Wright, 2016). With multinational pharmaceutical corporations exiting the field, the search for novel natural products, which remain a major source of novel bioactive compounds including antibiotics (Li and Vederas, 2009; Moloney, 2016), is largely concentrated in academia and small companies (Wright, 2017). Classical activity-based strain screening approaches, which are costly and which often result in a rediscovery of the already known compounds, are giving way to \u201csmarter\u201d techniques (Baltz, 2019). The genome mining approach relies on a \u201cfrom genes to products\u201d paradigm, which is the opposite of conventional activity-based antibiotic searches, and critically depends on the rapid accumulation of genomic data in publicly available databases (Ziemert et al., 2016).", "Antibiotics are extensively used worldwide in healthcare, agriculture, and food preservation.

They are produced by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of ribosomally synthesized precursors by dedicated enzyme machinery (Arnison et al., 2013). Compared to those of NRPs, RiPP BGCs are generally smaller and contain a precursor peptide gene, which enables better prediction of the final product structure based not only on the properties of enzymes involved in biosynthesis but also on the chemical structure of the initial peptide substrate. While the number of identified RiPPs grows, there is still an enormous space for the discovery of new compounds expanding the diversity within the already known RiPP subclasses and of entirely new groups of RiPPs harboring novel modifications, as evidenced, for example, by the recently described ranthipeptides (Hudson et al., 2019) and streptide-like RiPPs (Schramma et al., 2015).", "In addition to NRPs, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) comprise another rapidly expanding class of bioactive peptides.

The prokaryotic ribosome, another key target of many antibiotics currently in use (reviewed in Wilson, 2014; Polikanov et al., 2018), is also inhibited by certain RiPPs. In addition to RiPPs directly interacting with the ribosome, there are those that block translation by binding to elongation factors or inhibiting the activity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. In this review, we briefly summarize the available data on the structure, biosynthesis, mode of action, and BGC composition of the known RiPPs inhibiting different steps of translation (Figure 1). In addition, we specifically explore the genomic landscape of azol(in)e-containing RiPPs in an attempt to predict novel RiPPs inhibiting translation.

Addressing these questions is a challenging task, which partially explains the lack of detailed information about the precise mechanisms of action for many groups of RiPPs, including some that are known and have been studied for decades (e.g., bottromycin, McB). We hope that the upcoming years will provide more structural insights not only on the enzymology of RiPP modification widely studied now, but also on the principles the already known and novel compounds act by.", "In many cases, the analysis of genomic information was a starting point for further successful discoveries of a novel RiPP, facilitating the prediction of the BGC product based on the sequences of precursor peptides and modification enzymes. Through genome mining, future studies will not only result in the discovery of new compounds but will also allow systemization of our knowledge about RiPP genomic landscape and a better understanding of RiPP clusters\u2019 evolutionary relations.", "In many cases, the analysis of genomic information was a starting point for further successful discoveries of a novel RiPP, facilitating the prediction of the BGC product based on the sequences of precursor peptides and modification enzymes.
