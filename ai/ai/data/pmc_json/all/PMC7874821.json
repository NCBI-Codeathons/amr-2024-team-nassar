Three derivates showed diminished antimicrobial activity against a sensitive strain. The mutated loci showed high similarity to the quorum sensing genes of the AHL-synthase and its regulator. Another mutant was affected in a gene coding for a LysrR-type transcriptional regulator. The production of toxoflavin, the most well known antimicrobial-molecule and a major virulence factor of plant-pathogenic B. glumae and B. gladioli was explored. The absence of a yellowish pigment related to toxoflavin and the undetectable transcription of toxA in the mutants indicated the participation of the QS system and of the LysR-type transcriptional regulator in the regulation of toxoflavin. Additionally, those genes were found to be related to the swarming phenotype. Lettuce inoculated with the AHL synthase and the lysR mutants showed less severe symptoms. We present evidence of the participation of both, the quorum sensing and for the first time, of a LysR-type transcriptional regulator in antibiosis and swarming phenotype in a strain of B. gladioli", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Most microorganisms depend on quorum sensing (QS) as a means for detecting and facing environmental conditions. Individual cells release signaling molecules that are detected by the rest of the population and other bacterial communities living in their microhabitats. They function by making the bacterial cells aware of the density of their own population and of other species as well. Besides this, cells receive information on mass transfer in their microhabitat. These signaling molecules also play a critical role in the activation or silencing of specific metabolic pathways in order to cope with current environmental conditions [1]. The physiological responses regulated trough QS are diverse; including bioluminescence, conjugation, virulence, antibiotic synthesis, extracellular protease activity, response genes to oxidative-conditions, flagellar morphogenesis, swarming motility, root nodulation, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, reduction of oxidative stress and glutamate uptake [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].", "Most microorganisms depend on quorum sensing (QS) as a means for detecting and facing environmental conditions.

LysR-type proteins act as transcriptional activators or repressors of genes, including negative self-regulation. There are two principal domains of LysR-type proteins, an N-terminal domain of DNA-binding and a C-terminal domain of co-inducer-binding which appears to be essential for its proper functioning. The co-inducer is often an intermediate or a metabolic product of the pathway, and its binding generates a feedback loop [review 13].", "The LysR family of transcriptional regulators (LTTR) is involved in the local or global regulation of genes associated to virulence, metabolism, quorum sensing and motility.

Toxoflavin is a virulence factor demonstrated by the phytopathogen B. glumae [49,50,74,75] and potentially involved in the phytopathogenicity of B. gladioli [53]. In both models, N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), and N-octanoyl homoserine lactone (C8-HSL), are synthesized by TofI, the ortholog of the AHL synthase LuxI [49,76]. This TofR-C8-HSL complex activates the regulatory cascade of toxoflavin synthesis and its transport in B. glumae [49]. Besides its virulence role in plant-pathogenic bacteria, toxoflavin shows strong antimicrobial activity. Recently, the genome analysis of 88 isolates of a B. gladioli collection revealed that the toxoflavin biosynthetic pathway is conserved across all genomes [77].

The Himar1 insertion was located near the C-terminal domain (nucleotide 634) that is essential for binding the co-inducer (Fig. 2B). The antibiosis of BG79 against the sensitive strain was severely diminished, suggesting a positive regulation of genetic elements involved in the synthesis and/or transport of toxoflavin. All of the B. gladioli sequenced genomes, including BSR3, show this same region with identical gene context among them (Results not shown). In all of them, downstream to the lysR locus there is a hypothetical protein in the opposite transcription direction. Upstream to lysR there is one hypothetical OmpC family outer membrane protein and one hypothetical protein, both in the opposite transcription direction to the lysR gene. In the regulatory circuit of toxoflavin production by B. glumae BGR1, ToxR positively regulates the toxoflavin biosynthesis and transport genes. It is a LysR-type protein that recognizes toxoflavin as a co-inducer [49].

In all of them, downstream to the lysR locus there is a hypothetical protein in the opposite transcription direction. Upstream to lysR there is one hypothetical OmpC family outer membrane protein and one hypothetical protein, both in the opposite transcription direction to the lysR gene. In the regulatory circuit of toxoflavin production by B. glumae BGR1, ToxR positively regulates the toxoflavin biosynthesis and transport genes. It is a LysR-type protein that recognizes toxoflavin as a co-inducer [49].

Toxoflavin is a virulence factor demonstrated by the phytopathogen B. glumae [49,50,74,75] and potentially involved in the phytopathogenicity of B. gladioli [53]. In both models, N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), and N-octanoyl homoserine lactone (C8-HSL), are synthesized by TofI, the ortholog of the AHL synthase LuxI [49,76]. This TofR-C8-HSL complex activates the regulatory cascade of toxoflavin synthesis and its transport in B. glumae [49]. Besides its virulence role in plant-pathogenic bacteria, toxoflavin shows strong antimicrobial activity. Recently, the genome analysis of 88 isolates of a B. gladioli collection revealed that the toxoflavin biosynthetic pathway is conserved across all genomes [77]. The genetic element interrupted by the transposon Himar1 in BG79 shows a 99% nucleotide identity with a gene of the lysR family, harbored in chromosome 2 of B. gladioli BSR3, nt 1581223 to nt 1582191 (GenBank CP002600.1). The gene is transcribed independently and encodes for a LysR-type protein of 322 a.a. (Table 2). The Himar1 insertion was located near the C-terminal domain (nucleotide 634) that is essential for binding the co-inducer (Fig. 2B).

In in vitro assays, we detected synthesis of toxoflavin, an important virulence factor involved in the pathogenicity of B. gladioli and B. glumae in rice and onion [53,75]. Although we have not detected pathogenic activity of B. gladioli UAPS07070 in pineapple. In in vitro assays in onions, this strain induces pathogenic symptoms. Peculiarly, the BG1232, BG87 and BG79 mutants seem to induce tissue maceration in onion bulb scales (Results not shown). Mutants BG1232 and BG79 showed less severe soft rotting in lettuce leaves (Fig. 1E). On the other hand, mutant in the tofR locus, BG87, did not show apparent decrease in virulence in lettuce (Fig. 1E). This is probably due to the AHL synthesis that could regulate toxoflavin-independent virulence mechanisms (Fig. 1A). QS regulatory networks of B. glumae, the close relative to B. gladioli are diverse as has been shown for strains BGR1 and PG1 [49,86]. Pathogenicity in B. glumae PG1 seem to be regulated by two different quorum sensing systems while in BGR1 is only regulated by one system [49,86]. B. gladioli BSR3 possess two distant quorum systems in different replicons (Acc. Nums. NC_015376 and NC_015382) [72]. It is unknown if UAPS07070 possesses more than one quorum loci and if one or both of them are related to pathogenicity. Lee et al. [53] reported that between B. gladioli and B. glumae there are differences in the participation of quorum sensing regulation. B. gladioli strain KACC11889 carries the genetic elements for the biosynthesis of toxoflavin but does not possess the quorum sensing genes for activating the synthesis of the phytotoxin. Nevertheless, B. gladioli KACC11889 still induces tissue maceration of onion bulb scales and exhibits swarming movement and cannot cause damage in rice. Thus, the regulation in this bacterium might have evolved differently to B. gladioli BSR3 and B. glumae BGR1, since in those strains the inactivation of QS system abolished the virulence in onion, toxoflavin production and the swarming motility [49,52,53,58]. Interestingly, two strains of the same species B. glumae, BGR1 and PG1, show different regulatory QS behavior [49,86]. It is known that B. glumae 237-5, an avirulent strain in rice does not produce toxoflavin and keeps its virulence in onion, indicating that the tissue maceration in onion is not attributed exclusively to toxoflavin [75].", "B. gladioli UAPS07070 inhabits pineapple as an avirulent bacterium [85].
