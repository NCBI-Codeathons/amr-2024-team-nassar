["Pathogenic biofilm formation within food processing industries raises a serious public health and safety concern, and places burdens on the economy. Biofilm formation on equipment surfaces is a rather complex phenomenon, wherein multiple steps are involved in bacterial biofilm formation. In this review we discuss the stages of biofilm formation, the existing literature on the impact of surface properties and shear stress on biofilms, types of bioreactors, and antimicrobial coatings. The review underscores the significance of prioritizing biofilm prevention strategies as a first line of defense, followed by control measures. Utilizing specific biofilm eradication strategies as opposed to a uniform approach is crucial because biofilms exhibit different behavioral outcomes even amongst the same species when the environmental conditions change. This review is geared towards biofilm researchers and food safety experts, and seeks to derive insights into the scope of biofilm formation, prevention, and control. The use of suitable bioreactors is paramount to understanding the mechanisms of biofilm formation. The findings provide useful information to researchers involved in bioreactor selection for biofilm investigation, and food processors in surfaces with novel antimicrobial coatings, which provide minimal bacterial attachment.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Biofilm formation in food processing industries can lead to health risks and financial losses for consumers, leading to unproductive resource consumption. Biofilms are well-organized microbial aggregates embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix and adhere to biotic or abiotic surfaces [1,2,3]. Biofilms are generally defined as a cluster of microbes that thrive on biotic and abiotic systems and surfaces [4]. However, they are not simply a part of a \u201cgathering\u201d, but are instead very active, 3D, dynamic, and possess complex functionalities. Although the term \u201cbiofilm\u201d itself does not have a widely accepted definition, according to Lewandowski et al. [3], it can be defined as follows: \u201ca biofilm is considered to be an aggregate of microorganisms embedded in a matrix composed of microbially produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and attached to a surface\u201d. As a result of evolution, by exhibiting homeostatic responses and gene regulations, the biofilms help microorganisms to proliferate in extreme environments [5].", "Biofilm formation in food processing industries can lead to health risks and financial losses for consumers, leading to unproductive resource consumption.

Stages of Biofilm Formation", "1.1. Stages of Biofilm Formation", "1.1. Stages of Biofilm Formation", "Microorganisms undertake multiple steps to form biofilms, such as initial attachment, microcolony formation, maturation, and dispersion [1], as shown in Figure 1. The initial contact of the bacteria with a substrate is reversible. Multiple physical and chemical forces, such as electrostatic and cohesive forces, play a vital role at this stage. The appendage structures, like the fimbria and pili, present on the cell membrane strengthen the bacteria\u2013surface attachment. After getting attached to the surface, the bacteria start to divide and multiply. During this developmental stage, extracellular matrix formation takes place [6]. This matrix encompasses an extracellular polysaccharide substance (EPS) and structural proteins, among other components, which keep the colony safe from external variables, and this phase is called \u201cirreversible attachment\u201d [1]. Microcolonies form during this irreversible stage of attachment. Microcolony formation gives rise to cell\u2013cell communication (quorum sensing) [6,7]. Bacteria in the microcolonies use \u201cquorum sensing\u201d to exchange information among themselves, and this enables the EPS to modify in response to and withstand any changes in the environment (such as pH, temperature, pressure, concentration and shear stresses). Based on this communication, the bacterial behavior can become more cooperative, competitive, or mutually beneficial [8]. The formation of small channels within the microcolonies facilitates nutrient distribution among the bacteria in biofilms [5]. The last stage of biofilm formation is characterized by the natural dispersion of bacteria from existing microcolonies. When the bacteria become naturally detached from their biofilm, either as single cells or as a cluster, they seek to colonize their environment, thereby acquiring new sites in the system, and this gives rise to an even further increase in biofilm formation [9].", "Microorganisms undertake multiple steps to form biofilms, such as initial attachment, microcolony formation, maturation, and dispersion [1], as shown in Figure 1.

Social Dynamics: Cooperative and Competitive Interactions in Biofilm Consortia", "As mentioned earlier, biofilms have been involved in the evolutionary biology of bacteria competing for nutrients, co-evolving with other organisms via either inter-dependency or by opportunistically exploiting other bacterial species, allowing them to evolve and sustain in nature. When multiple bacteria exist in a consortium and form a biofilm, they engage in social behaviors such as quorum sensing, and metabolic competitive or cooperative interactions [10]. By taking the form of such a group, these bacteria make multiple survival decisions based on external stressors such as UV light, temperature, pH, pressure, and antimicrobial agents. The definitions of these behaviors are often confounding because an advantageous behavior for one species can be detrimental for the other; so, it can be confusing whether to define a specific behavior as cooperative, because one of the species is flourishing, or as competitive (antagonistic), because the other species is on the verge of being removed from that environment. Cooperative interactions can lead to the formation of desirable spatial organizations that enhance the supply of nutrients throughout biofilms [11]. Besides this, coaggregation plays a vital role in biofilm formation via the involvement of specific surface structure such as pili and flagella. Cooperative interactions can also protect the biofilms from antimicrobial agents by producing strong EPS. A study by Lee et al. [12] discovered this behavior when using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas protegens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to form multi-species biofilms. The spatial structures of the multi-species biofilms were different, but they were also more resistant to antimicrobials than single-species biofilms. More importantly, Bridier et al. [13] reported that Pseudomonas biofilms could alter their exopolymer matrix to increase their resistance against antimicrobials, such as chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride, or triclosan. While spatial distribution is an inherent morphological attribute of biofilms, it is strongly influenced by chemical stressors.", "As mentioned earlier, biofilms have been involved in the evolutionary biology of bacteria competing for nutrients, co-evolving with other organisms via either inter-dependency or by opportunistically exploiting other bacterial species, allowing them to evolve and sustain in nature.

It can be debated as to whether biofilms prefer competitive or cooperative behaviors. Nonetheless, these behaviors lead to the expression of virulence factors, antibacterial proteins, and gene expressions. For example, competition can alter the quorum-sensing response of the bacterial species in biofilms [15]. In multi-species biofilms of P. aeruginosa and E. coli, the sustenance of E. coli is determined by the production of indole by the E. coli bacteria. However, when the E. coli mutates, its mutants may not synthesize indole, which should result in the abundant growth of P. aeruginosa with subsequent reduction in E. coli populations. However, indole blocks the toxins and quorum sensing phenotypes of P. aeruginosa, thus benefitting E. coli survival [16].

Similarly, cell density and the extracellular polysaccharide content were also lower under low shear stress. Further, the biofilm density increased, while its thickness decreased, under turbulent flow. Biofilms subjected to turbulent flow not only showed an increased cell density (bacterial population per cm2), but also showed an increased volumetric density (mg/cm3) and biofilm mass (mg/cm2). Vieira [38] investigated the effects of laminar and turbulent flow at Re values of 2000 and 5200, respectively, on Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm formation. The findings of this study resonate with the findings derived by Lemos et al. [37], who reported that the biofilms showed a higher cellular density and increased mass per cm2 under turbulent flows. The use of a rotating cylindrical reactor (RCR) in simulating the flows in elbows or pockets used in a specific industry might require the correlation of the flow specifics of these devices. Pipe fittings such as elbows or dead ends are involved in the back-mixing of the fluid. Rotating annular cylinders might induce the development of vortices on their surfaces. Also, the presence of multiple cylinders in the RCR might result in vortices interfering in the section between the two cylinders, leading to laminar flow with eddies or turbulence, especially when the desired flow is laminar. This specific area of correlation between the bioreactors and the pipe fittings\u2019 actual dimensions has been overlooked in studies [37].", "Several authors have recognized the effects of different flow conditions on biofilm formation.

Some of the factors reasoned to impact biofilm formation include surface roughness, hydrophobicity, material properties, surface charge and surface finish. De-la-Pinta et al. [56] studied the effects of polycarbonate, silicone, titanium, borosilicate, and Teflon on the biofilm-forming abilities of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and a C. albicans. In their study, the surface materials were machine-finished to alter their surface roughness using silicon carbide grinding papers with grit numbers 320, 800, 1200, and 4000. They observed that modifying the surface roughness affected the wettability of the surface. Surface hydrophobicity is not an inherent physical property of a material, and it can be altered via changes in surface roughness. Teflon, silicone, and polycarbonates are classified as more hydrophobic, and overall, E. coli biofilm formation was higher on these materials. This is a noteworthy observation because of the conventional and acceptable use of Teflon on the coatings of cookware. In general, if the diameters of the bacteria were greater than the degree of surface roughness of the material, staphylococcal biofilms were found to be sparse. This observation was contradicted when the untreated surface was compared with a surface polished with a 4000-grit smoother. The results of this study imply that the degree of symmetry of surface heights on the mean plane (Ssk) might play an essential role in determining the degree of microbial attachment to the surface.

Recently, Regulski et al. [91] reported the efficacy of using silver as an antimicrobial substance in various dressings, such as dressings with a nanocrystalline coating of silver (Nano Ag) on the wound, silver-impregnated CMC-1.2% Ag dressings, and Poly-Sheet Metallic Ag and Polyurethane foam absorbent dressings containing silver salt against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa mixed-species biofilms. The populations of S. aureus recovered from membranes inoculated with mixed-species biofilms have shown significant reductions when Nano Ag was used (3.42 log CFU reduction), and significant reductions in P. aeruginosa populations (4.57 log CFU reduction) have been achieved with Poly-Sheet Metallic Ag wound dressings compared to untreated controls. The antimicrobial efficacy of silver nanoparticles-coated surfaces against Streptococus mutans biofilms was evaluated [116]. A CDC bioreactor was used to grow S. mutans biofilms on hydroxyapatite coupons, and then the biofilms were treated with silver nanoparticles in microtiter plates. The results show that a 2.3 log CFU reduction in S. mutans in biofilms was observed at a 100 ppm concentration, and up to 7 log reduction was achieved when the concentration was increased to 1000 ppm.

Conclusions", "4. Conclusions", "Multispecies bacterial communities are prevalent in natural environments, and the utilization of bioreactors for their assessment is a vital area of research with direct relevance to diverse fields, including food science, environmental science, medicine, biotechnology, and space science, among others. Specifically, the prevalence of biofilms in food industry settings, such as on food contact surfaces, underscores the significance of understanding biofilm formation. Since there are a multitude of factors responsible for biofilm formation, such as surface properties, shear stresses, environmental conditions and bacterial characteristics, to name a few, the investigation of biofilm-related phenomena is quite complex. Further, this review emphasizes that the process of biofilm formation is not only shear-dependent, but also depends on the hydrodynamic conditions within the bioreactors employed to examine the impact of the applied shear stress. Besides investigating biofilm formation, studies have shown that there is a vital link between the shear stress involved in biofilm formation and detachment. The judicious selection of bioreactors is extremely critical for studying biofilm growth and removal, and for developing preventative and control measures. While investigating biofilm removal techniques, especially from the perspective of food safety, prioritizing preventative strategies is crucial. Besides sanitary design and operation practices, the development of antimicrobial coatings used as sustainable biofilm-removal treatments is imperative, and these attempts must adopt a holistic perspective when addressing the challenges associated with biofilms.", "Multispecies bacterial communities are prevalent in natural environments, and the utilization of bioreactors for their assessment is a vital area of research with direct relevance to diverse fields, including food science, environmental science, medicine, biotechnology, and space science, among others.
