["Enterocin DD14 (EntDD14) is a two-peptide leaderless bacteriocin produced by the Enterococcus faecalis 14 strain previously isolated from meconium. This bacteriocin is mainly active against Gram-positive bacteria. Leaderless bacteriocins do not undergo post-translational modifications and are therefore immediately active after their synthesis. As a result, the cells that produce such bacteriocins have developed means of protection against them which often involve transport systems. In this and our previous work, we constructed different mutants deleted in the genes involved in the transport functions, thus covering all the supposed components of this transport system, using Listeria innocua ATCC 33090 as the indicator strain to assess the activity of externalized EntDD14. We also assessed the self-resistance of the WT and all its engineered derivative mutants against EntDD14, provided extracellularly, in order to evaluate their self-resistance. The results obtained highlight that the ABC transporter constituted by the DdG, H, I, and J proteins contributes to EntDD14 export as well as resistance to an external supply of EntDD14. Our results also have established the essential role of the DdE and DdF proteins as primary transporters dedicated to the externalization of EntDD14. Moreover, the in silico data showed that DdE and DdF appear to assemble in a formation that forms an essential channel for the exit of EntDD14. This channel DdEF may interact with the ABC transporter DdGHIJ in order to control the flow of bacteriocin across the membrane, although the nature of this interaction remains to be elucidated.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Bacteria compete with other microorganisms in their ecological niches for nutrients and other biotic and abiotic resources, and many have developed mechanisms enabling them to outcompete their rival congeners. One of these is the production of bacteriocins, which are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides [1,2,3] produced by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as by Archaea [1,4]. Bacteriocins produced by Gram-positive bacteria are currently the most studied, particularly the bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (designated as LAB-bacteriocins). Usually, LAB-bacteriocins possess narrow spectra and therefore are active against phylogenetically close bacteria. Nonetheless, some LAB-bacteriocins can target phylogenetically distant bacteria [5].", "Bacteria compete with other microorganisms in their ecological niches for nutrients and other biotic and abiotic resources, and many have developed mechanisms enabling them to outcompete their rival congeners.

These precursor peptides are known to be inactive and must be stripped of their leader peptide to produce the active form of the bacteriocin [6]. Some of these bacteriocins can undergo enzymatic post-translational modifications (PTM), leading to post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) [7]. Accordingly, bacteriocins can be classified into two main classes: class I, containing RiPPs; and class II, containing unmodified bacteriocins [8]. These bacteriocins are low-molecular-weight (<10 kDa) thermostable peptides. There is also a third class of high-molecular-weight, thermolabile bacteriocins [9,10].", "Bacteriocins are synthesized as precursor peptides, in which the core peptide is preceded by an N-terminal leader peptide.

These leaderless bacteriocins (LLB) were discovered by Cintas and co-workers following the characterization of an enterococcal bacteriocin named L50 [12]. As can be predicted from the considerable number of genes constituting the genetic determinants of bacteriocins, their synthesis requires a mechanism involving modification, transport, and immunity proteins and in some cases additional accessory proteins [13]. Genes coding for bacteriocins are generally organized as operons, located either on plasmids or in the chromosome, and their expressions are usually co-regulated [13]. The transport of these bacteriocins is most often mediated by an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter system [14] and in some cases by a secretory pathway [15]. The transport of leaderless bacteriocins is not yet fully understood. A first study conducted on aureocin 70 showed the involvement of an ABC type transporter named AurT, which is responsible of the externalization of the LLB aureocin A70 [16], while NisT is the main transporter for nisin [17]. The ABC transporter can help mature the bacteriocin by cleaving the leader peptide, or it may be carried out with the participation of an associated protein [6,14].", "However, there is a relatively small number of bacteriocins that are synthesized without a leader peptide and are therefore active after their translation in the cytoplasm [11].
