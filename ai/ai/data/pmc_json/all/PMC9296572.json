["Abstract", "The biosynthesis of the natural product dehydrofosmidomycin involves an unusual transformation in which 2\u2010(trimethylamino)ethylphosphonate is rearranged, desaturated and demethylated by the enzyme DfmD, a divergent member of the 2\u2010oxoglutarate\u2010dependent dioxygenase superfamily. Although other members of this enzyme family catalyze superficially similar transformations, the combination of all three reactions in a single enzyme has not previously been observed. By characterizing the products of in vitro reactions with labeled and unlabeled substrates, we show that DfmD performs this transformation in two steps, with the first involving desaturation of the substrate to form 2\u2010(trimethylamino)vinylphosphonate, and the second involving rearrangement and demethylation to form methyldehydrofosmidomycin. These data reveal significant differences from the desaturation and rearrangement reactions catalyzed by other family members.", "DfmD is a highly divergent member of the 2\u2010oxoglutarate\u2010dependent dioxygenase superfamily that catalyzes desaturation, rearrangement and demethylation of its substrate. In vitro biochemical studies and homology modeling suggest that these transformations occur via novel chemistry.", "E. I. Parkinson, H. G. Lakkis, A. A. Alwali, M. E. M. Metcalf, R. Modi, W. W.

In either case, the heteroatom then uses its lone pair to form a double bond between the heteroatom and adjacent carbon. Subsequent deprotonation of the \u03b1\u2010carbon followed by double bond rearrangement gives the final desaturated product. Neither of these mechanisms are possible for desaturation of TMAEP due to the absence of a lone pair on the tetra\u2010substituted nitrogen. Moreover, dimethyl\u20102\u2010aminoethyl\u2010phosphonate, which does have a lone pair on the adjacent nitrogen, is not processed by DfmD. Combined, these data strongly suggest an alternative mechanism of desaturation (Figure\u20056A). The first step of this mechanism would involve abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the \u03b1\u2010carbon (relative to the phosphonate), similar to the first step in hydroxylation of TMAEP by TmpA. Based on the models presented above, this carbon is positioned 4.1\u2005\u00c5 from the FeII, a distance consistent with hydrogen atom abstraction. After initial radical formation, three potential desaturation pathways can be proposed (Figure\u20056A). In path A, hydroxylation at the \u03b1\u2010position would occur, followed by abstraction of a proton by a base within the active site and subsequent loss of water. (A similar mechanism (not shown) involving hydroxylation at the \u03b2\u2010position could also be envisioned.) In the homology model, two amino acids, deprotonated S183 and S185, stand out as potential bases for the elimination, with their side chain oxygens being 4.1\u2005\u00c5 and 4.3\u2005\u00c5 away from the \u03b2\u2010carbon, respectively. The loss of activity in the S183A mutant supports the idea that S183 plays this role. Interestingly, the corresponding residue in TmpA (N187) cannot serve this function, providing a potential explanation for different products that are observed. In path B, a second hydrogen atom could be abstracted by the FeIII species resulting in a di\u2010radical species that would recombine to give the alkene. However, it should be noted that similar proposals have been questioned based on the relatively poor oxidation capacity of the FeIII\u2010OH species.[\n16a\n, \n32\n] In path C, a radical could be transferred to the FeIII to give a di\u2010cation species that could then undergo proton abstraction.
