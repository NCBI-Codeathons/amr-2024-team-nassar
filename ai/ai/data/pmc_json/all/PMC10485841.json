Agriculture relies heavily on chemical pesticides to control disease, but due to safety concerns multiple agents have been withdrawn. Burkholderia were successfully used as commercial biopesticides because of their fungicidal activity and plant protective traits. However, their potential for opportunistic pathogenicity led to a moratorium on their registration as biopesticides. Subsequently, Burkholderia were shown to produce multiple specialised metabolites including potent antimicrobial polyynes. Cepacin A, a polyyne produced by Burkholderia ambifaria biopesticide strains was shown to be an important metabolite for the protection of germinating peas against Globisporangium ultimum (formerly Pythium) damping-off disease. Recently, there has been an expansion in bacterial polyyne discovery, with the metabolites and their biosynthetic gene pathways found in several bacterial genera including Burkholderia, Collimonas, Trinickia, and Pseudomonas. To define the efficacy of these bacterial polyyne producers as biopesticidal agents, we systematically evaluated metabolite production, in vitro microbial antagonism, and G. ultimum biocontrol across a panel of 30 strains representing four bacterial genera. In vitro polyyne production and antimicrobial activity was demonstrated for most strains, but only Burkholderia polyyne producers were protective within the in vivo G. ultimum damping-off pea protection model. B. ambifaria was the most effective cepacin-expressing biopesticide, and despite their known potential for plant pathogenicity Burkholderia gladioli and Burkholderia plantarii were uniquely shown to be protective as caryoynencin-producing biopesticides. In summary, Burkholderia are effective biopesticides due to their suite of antimicrobials, but the ability to deploy polyyne metabolites, caryoynencin and cepacin, is strain and species dependent.", "Graphical Abstract", "Graphical Abstract", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Damping-off diseases that kill planted seeds and germinating crops are a global agricultural problem with an urgent need for new, sustainable control measures (Lamichhane et al., 2017). The oomycete Globisporangium ultimum Trow (synonym Pythium ultimum Trow; Uzuhashi et al., 2010) is a member of the Pythium sensu lato complex and causes damping-off and root-rot disease in a diverse range of plants, including Pisum sativum and other agriculturally important legumes (Hendrix and Campbell, 1973). Typically, infection occurs through mycelia or oospores persisting within the soil which then infect seeds and the root system leading to severe wilting, reduced yields, and plant death. This ultimately causes major global economic losses, notably in organic vegetable production (Alcala et al., 2016; Lamichhane et al., 2017). Commercial losses occur as direct costs from damage to the seeds and seedlings, or as indirect costs due to additional replanting and lower yields from delayed sowing times (Lamichhane et al., 2017).", "Damping-off diseases that kill planted seeds and germinating crops are a global agricultural problem with an urgent need for new, sustainable control measures (Lamichhane et al., 2017).

Therefore, finding novel disease management strategies and agents with less impact on the environment is of major importance, and also required to meet international objectives for environmental sustainability (Hulot and Hiller, 2021). Biological control of damping-off disease using naturally occurring antagonistic bacteria (biopesticides) is one such approach. The environmentally friendly potential of microbial biopesticides has led to a renewed interest in these disease control approaches (Fira et al., 2018; Mullins et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2021).

Polyynes are compounds with alternating triple and single carbon\u2013carbon bonds that have attracted considerable interest because of their unusual structure, high reactivity, and antimicrobial properties (Ross et al., 2014).

Successful rhizosphere colonisation, and the ability of the bacterium to persist and compete with the soil microbial community are clearly important attributes for an effective biocontrol agent. It is probable that the combination of these factors along with other qualities, including production of other antimicrobials (Mullins et al., 2019; Webster et al., 2020a), allows B. ambifaria BCC0191 to be a more efficient biocontrol agent in the G. ultimum damping-off assay than other strains of B. ambifaria. Previously, it has been shown that many Pseudomonas species are effective biocontrol agents due to their ability to colonise the plant surface (spermosphere, rhizosphere and phyllosphere) and the endosphere (Lugtenberg et al., 2001). These Pseudomonads not only protect plants by producing bioactive metabolites but can also use plant exudates with high growth rates, allowing them to compete with other microorganisms for space and nutrients in the plant environment (Lugtenberg et al., 2001). For example, the biocontrol ability of P. fluorescens strain 54/96 in the control of Pythium damping-off disease is based on their capacity to colonise plant tissues, exhibit high growth rates and outcompete the pathogen for limited plant nutrients and infection sites (Ellis et al., 1999). Colonisation of plant roots by bacterial endophytes through crack entry between adjacent cells, during emergence of lateral roots is well established (Webster et al., 1998).", "Overall, this comparative evaluation of phenotypic traits demonstrated that multiple factors, in addition to polyyne production, play a role in the biological control efficacy of B. ambifaria strains. Successful rhizosphere colonisation, and the ability of the bacterium to persist and compete with the soil microbial community are clearly important attributes for an effective biocontrol agent. It is probable that the combination of these factors along with other qualities, including production of other antimicrobials (Mullins et al., 2019; Webster et al., 2020a), allows B. ambifaria BCC0191 to be a more efficient biocontrol agent in the G. ultimum damping-off assay than other strains of B. ambifaria. Previously, it has been shown that many Pseudomonas species are effective biocontrol agents due to their ability to colonise the plant surface (spermosphere, rhizosphere and phyllosphere) and the endosphere (Lugtenberg et al., 2001).

The exploration of Burkholderia species has rightly focused on their pathogenic traits over the past two decades, however, multiple studies are now beginning to uncover the mechanisms and specialised metabolites that underpin their biological control proficiency (Mullins et al., 2019; Murata et al., 2021). However, it was unknown whether other Burkholderia strains or bacterial species encoding cepacin, caryoynencin and other polyyne BGCs were capable of similar protective biopesticidal roles. Our strain panel represented nine species and four polyyne BGCs, and in vitro microbial antagonisms was systematically compared to their efficacy in a pea biological control model with G. ultimum damping-off disease.", "Given the lack of studies on Burkholderia biocontrol agents since the EPA risk assessment moratorium in 1999, there has been a comparative dearth of investigation into the mode of action and efficacy of strains within this genus compared to Pseudomonas and Bacillus where multiple strains and metabolites have been studied (Dimki\u0107 et al., 2022).

In contrast to its widely characterised plant and human pathogenic nature (Jones et al., 2021), B. gladioli was uniquely shown to be an efficacious anti-damping off agent when interacted with germinating plants (Figure 3B), with the polyyne caryoynencin demonstrated to be a key metabolite in mediating G. ultimum biocontrol. Moreover, despite the protective B. gladioli strain being shown to be capable of producing broad-host range toxins such as toxoflavin and bongkrekic acid in vitro, these metabolites were suppressed on the biomimetic PEM medium, and the excellent pea survival rate suggested that toxic metabolites or pathogenic factors were not being deployed during the pea rhizosphere colonisation. Overall, the protective phenotype of caryoynencin, associated with rhizosphere colonisation of germinating peas exhibited by B. gladioli and B. plantarii in the biocontrol model, contrasts to the historical perspective of these bacteria as plant pathogens (Maeda et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2021). The beneficial interactions observed in this study suggests that the plant pathogenic lifestyle of B. gladioli and B. plantarii is likely host specific and opportunistic dependent on multiple factors such as host age and damage.", "Considerable differences were observed in biocontrol proficiency between evolutionarily close species of B. ambifaria and B. vietnamiensis despite equivalent in vitro microbial antagonism and cepacin production (Figures 2, 3).

This aligns to their successful commercial use and sheds light on their mechanism of action as biopesticides capable of protecting peas, maize, and other crops species (Parke and Gurian-Sherman, 2001). Interestingly, Pseudomonas protegens lacked noticeable biocontrol activity against G. ultimum on peas despite in vitro antagonism (Figure 3) and the observed protection mediated by protegencin in the biocontrol of G. ultimum in a cucumber model (Murata et al., 2021). These differences suggest host-specific interactions, as well as abilities such as rhizosphere colonisation rate, persistence, antimicrobial arsenal, and the ability to compete within the soil-associated microbial community play additional roles in successful biological control.
