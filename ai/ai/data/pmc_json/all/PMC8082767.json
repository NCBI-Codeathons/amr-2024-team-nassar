However, there are few reports on the effects of NO on fungal growth and secondary metabolism. NO may mediate L-arginine-induced conidiation of Coniothyrium minitans [20].

De novo sequencing and comparative analysis revealed 113 putative DEGs were enriched in 10 items related to fungal hypocrellin production (Additional file 2: Table S5 and S6), including \u2018polyketide synthase\u2019, \u2018hydroxylase\u2019, \u2018probable metabolite transport protein\u2019, and so forth. Among them, more than 75% DEGs which are associated with intracellular hypocrellin biosynthesis were up-regulated compared with control group (Additional file 2: Table S5 and Fig.\u00a04a), such as laccase-like multicopper oxidase (MCO, TRINITY_DN31904_c0_g1_i4), conidial yellow pigment biosynthesis polyketide synthase (PKS, TRINITY_DN73250_c0_g1_i1), hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (Omef, TRINITY_DN28714_c0_g2_i1), FAD dependent oxidoreductase (FAD, TRINITY_DN33725_c0_g1_i8), phenol hydroxylase (Hyd, TRINITY_DN84020_c0_g1_i1), cytochrome P450 CYP2 subfamily (Mono, TRINITY_DN31508_c0_g2_i1), fasciclin (Fas, TRINITY_DN43991_c0_g1_i1) (Table 2). The expression levels of seven randomly selected unigenes related to hypocrellin biosynthesis were confirmed through qRT-PCR strictly (Fig.\u00a04b), in which Hyd and PKS were more dramatically up-regulated by 59.35- and 14.59-fold, separately. The expression changes by qRT-PCR showed a similar tendency to those in transcriptome data (Table 2). In addition, it was found that more than 60% DEGs bound up with extracellular HA exportation were also up-regulated (Additional file 2: Table S6), such as major facilitator superfamily (MFS, TRINITY_DN33647_c1_g1_i8), ABC superfamily (ABC, TRINITY_DN73211_c0_g2_i1), secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism (MTP, TRINITY_DN30127_c0_g1_i1) (Table 2). Meanwhile, the SNP-induced up-regulation of transcriptional expression of selected unnigene MFS (TRINITY_DN33647_c1_g1_i8) from 2.40- to 7.31-fold was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a04c).Fig. 4a Heat map of DEGs involved in hypocrellin biosynthesis of Shiraia sp.

In addition, it is widely used as nitric oxide donor in pharmacologic studies to investigate on the physiological roles of NO [14]. In plant cells or root cultures, SNP has been used as NO donor to elicit the production of important bioactive secondary metabolites such as anthocyanin and flavonol glycoside in Pisum sativum [30], and tropane alkaloids in hair roots culture of Hyoscyamus reticulatus [31]. More recently, the signal roles of NO in fungal developmental and metabolic biosynthesis have drawn more attention [32]. With the help of using NO donor SNP and NO scavengers, previous studies indicated that NO modulated the germination of C. coccodes conidia [21], hyphal elongation of Magnaporthe oryzae [33] and biosynthesis of fungal secondary metabolites such as styrylpyrone polyphenols, flavonoids and phenolics [23, 34]. However, it is less reported on SNP application as a chemical elicitor to enhance fungal metabolite production in mycelium cultures. In submerged cultures of G. lucidum, the eliciting effects of SNP at 0.5\u20135.0\u00a0mM on ganoderic triterpenoid production were investigated over 120\u00a0h [24]. The yields of ganoderic triterpenoids were increased by 40.94% at 72\u00a0h after SNP treatment at 5\u00a0mM. In our present study, NO elicited the biosynthesis of hypocrellins in Shiraia sp. S9, especially increased EA and HA contents in the mycelia (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Figure S3). After the optimization of the conditions for SNP application (the concentration and adding time) (Additional file 1: Figure S4 and S5), a higher production of HA (110.34\u00a0mg/L) was induced by SNP at 0.02\u00a0mM on day 7, a 2.65-fold increase over the control (Fig.\u00a03). Compared with other elicitors used to promote HA production in Shiraia cultures including light irradiation [35, 36], ultrasound exposure [25] or microbial elicitors [9, 37], the chemical elicitor SNP has the advantages of lower cost, easy preparation, no growth suppression, and high efficiency for eliciting metabolite production in the mycelium cultures.", "SNP is a potent vasodilator used clinically to treat hypertensive emergencies and heart failure.

The generated NO in mycelia was fully suppressed by a NO scavenger cPTIO, indicating exogenous SNP as a NO producer in the culture. Accumulating evidence showed NO could collaborate with the accompanied generation of ROS to form nitro-oxidative stress involved in human or plant diseases [14, 38]. Zheng et al. (2010) reported that the SNP (50\u00a0\u00b5M) promoted the H2O2 content in the hairy roots of A. annua elicited by fungal oligosaccharides [39]. SNP at 250\u00a0\u00b5M could enhance H2O2 level in adventitious roots of E. purpurea [17]. In this study, SNP treatment also resulted in an accumulation of ROS including O2\u2212 and H2O2 in the mycelia (Fig.\u00a06). Simultaneously, GO analysis demonstrated the enriched DEGs of \u2018oxidation\u2013reduction process\u2019 (GO:0055114), \u2018oxidoreductase activity\u2019 (GO:0016491) and \u2018electron carrier activity\u2019 (GO:0009055) in the group of molecular function (Additional file 1: Figure S8 and Additional file 2: Table S4). Both the gene expressions of ROS generating NOX and the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT and SOD were validated in SNP-treated mycelia (Fig.\u00a07), suggesting that SNP could activate NOX for the increased oxidative stress in the mycelium cultures. In fungal cultures, ROS could provoke the production of fungal secondary metabolites, such as carotenoid in Neurospora crassa [40], deoxynivalenol in Fusarium graminearum [41], ochratoxin A in A. ochraceus [42]. In our previous researches, ROS generation and oxidative stress were reported as early signal-response events leading to HA biosynthesis of Shiraia under various abiotic elicitors, including the applications of surfactant Triton X-100 [10], lower intensity ultrasound [25] and light\u2013dark shift [35]. These studies indicated the oxidative stress was involved in the hypocrellin biosynthesis of Shiraia. In our present study, we found 54 putative unigenes from 571 DEGs probably involved in hypocrellin biosynthesis after SNP treatment (Additional file 2: Table S5 and Fig.\u00a04a). It was supposed that hypocrellins were biosynthesized in fungal cells via repetitive decarboxylative condensation of acetyl- and malonyl-CoA by polyketide synthase (PKS), methylation, decarboxylation and reduction by O-methyltransferase (Omef), monooxygenase/hydroxylase (Mono/Hyd) and multicopper oxidase (MCO), and then the core structure formation via the cooperation of fasciclin (Fas), laccase and berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) [28, 43, 44]. The deletion and overexpression of SbaPKS indicated its essential role in the hypocrellin biosynthesis of Shiraia sp. SUPER-H168 [45]. SbaPKS also had a moderating effect on the transcriptional expression of its adjacent genes FAD, Omef, Mono and MCO in the gene cluster. Overexpression of Hyd gene in S. bambusicola S4201 resulted in ultra-higher production of HA (1180.1\u00a0mg/L) [46]. Most of above-mentioned unigenes have been up-regulated significantly in our present experiment after SNP application, especially the expression of Hyd (59.35-fold) and PKS (14.59-fold) genes (Fig.\u00a04b). The first transcription factor involved in HA biosynthesis is the zinc finger transcription factor zftf [29]. The zftf gene with a GAL4-like Zn(II)2Cys6 (or C6 zinc) binuclear cluster DNA-binding domain is located in the hypocrellin gene cluster. However, zftf is not the differentially expressed gene induced by SNP treatment (Additional file 2: Table S8). The up-regulated TFs were detected in the present study, including ERF, C3H and MYB (Table 2). These TFs have been studied extensively in initiating plant stress responses through involvement in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as terpenoid indole alkaloids, taxol, flavonoids and proanthocynanins [47]. The challenge would be to elucidate the regulatory role of these TFs in regulation of HA biosynthesis. Taken together, the results from our present study have shown that SNP induced oxidative stress and activated genes and TFs for hypocrellin biosynthesis.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to use SNP as a chemical elicitor in mycelium cultures to promote hypocrellin productions. SNP at a higher concentration (0.02\u00a0mM) acted as a pro-oxidant, thereby raising the ROS generation, up-regulating biosynthetical genes for hypocrellin production. The increased membrane permeability and gene expression of member transporters induced by SNP was associated with efflux of hypocrellins. Our results showed the increase of total hypocrellin production is mainly attributed to the cellular hypocrellin biosynthesis and the efflux. When the mycelium cultures were treated by SNP at 0.02\u00a0mM for 4\u00a0days, the highest production (110.34\u00a0mg/L) of HA was achieved without any fungal growth depression.
