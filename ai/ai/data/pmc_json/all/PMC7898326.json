["Abstract", "A nonenzymatic Pictet\u2010Spengler reaction has been postulated to give rise to a subset of naturally occurring uridyl peptide antibiotics (UPAs). Here, using a combination of strain engineering and synthetic chemistry, we demonstrate that Pictet\u2010Spengler chemistry may be employed to generate even greater diversity in the UPAs. We use an engineered strain to afford access to meta\u2010tyrosine containing pacidamycin 4. Pictet\u2010Spengler diversification of this compound using a small series of aryl\u2010aldehydes was achieved with some derivatives affording remarkable diastereomeric control.", "Beyond the natural: We demonstrate the importance of the N terminus to pacidamycin bioactivity. Incorporating meta\u2010tyrosine at the N\u2010terminal facilitates diversification of pacidamycins enabling use of Pictet\u2010Spengler chemistry and may enable the attenuation of compound activity.", "C.
