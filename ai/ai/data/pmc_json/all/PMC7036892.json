["The discovery of natural products continues to interest chemists and biologists for their utility in medicine as well as facilitating our understanding of signaling, pathogenesis, and evolution. Despite an attenuation in the discovery rate of new molecules, the current genomics and transcriptomics revolution has illuminated the untapped biosynthetic potential of many diverse organisms. Today, natural product discovery can be driven by biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) analysis, which is capable of predicting enzymes that catalyze novel reactions and organisms that synthesize new chemical structures. This approach has been particularly effective in mining bacterial and fungal genomes where it has facilitated the discovery of new molecules, increased the understanding of metabolite assembly, and in some instances uncovered enzymes with intriguing synthetic utility. While relatively less is known about the biosynthetic potential of non-fungal eukaryotes, there is compelling evidence to suggest many encode biosynthetic enzymes that produce molecules with unique bioactivities. In this review, we highlight how the advances in genomics and transcriptomics have aided natural product discovery in sources from eukaryotic lineages. We summarize work that has successfully connected genes to previously identified molecules and how advancing these techniques can lead to genetics-guided discovery of novel chemical structures and reactions distributed throughout the tree of life. Ultimately, we discuss the advantage of increasing the known biosynthetic space to ease access to complex natural and non-natural small molecules.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Nature\u2019s ever-growing repository of chemical structures and reactions continues to shape the fields of chemistry and biology. Of particular note is the impact of natural products in modern medicine. It is estimated that anywhere from 50 to 70% of all clinically approved drugs are natural products, natural product derivatives, or inspired by natural products [1]. Specifically, 51% of anticancer new chemical entities (NCEs) and 59% of antibiotic NCEs from 1981 to 2014 were natural products or directly derived from there [1]. As nature\u2019s small molecules are optimized through years of evolution, their affinity to their molecular targets is often exquisitely high. Thus, the discovery of natural products, especially with known targets, affords privileged chemical scaffolds for drug discovery and development [2].", "Nature\u2019s ever-growing repository of chemical structures and reactions continues to shape the fields of chemistry and biology.

For example, harmful algal blooms releasing toxic small molecules can decimate entire aquatic ecosystems and, consequentially, influence socioeconomic systems [8].", "Along with inspiration for drug design, natural product research presents critical questions about evolutionary ecology from individual species to entire biospheres [3,4].

While many of these natural products are indeed produced by associated microbiome members [50], de novo production has also been illustrated in marine animals [92], including sea slugs [51], nudibranchs [52], sponges [93], corals [62,94], sea urchins [91], and bryozoans [95], to give some examples. With a lack in genomic and transcriptomic data, connecting these molecules to their associated gene clusters remains a challenge. The sacoglossan sea slugs provide an intriguing example of connecting a marine natural product to the responsible genes [96]. Sea slugs from the Elysia genus are a fascinating clade of mollusks that often partake in kleptoplasty, a phenomenon where the chloroplasts from consumed algae are maintained and used as an energy source via photosynthesis [97]. A recent discovery illustrated that the defense compounds kahalalides, found in E. rufescens and the green algae it consumes (Bryopsis sp.), are actually produced via endosymbiotic bacteria residing within the green algae [98]. The complex intra-species relationships employed in this system highlights the challenges of tracing molecules to their producing organism. Elysia mollusks also produce complex natural products de novo [51]. The sacoglossan polypropionates (Figure 5A) are complex natural products that are produced with fixed carbon via photosynthesis [51]. Isotopic labeling studies suggest the polypropionates are assembled through iterative construction of methylmalonyl-CoA building blocks, indicating the metabolites are fatty acid and polyketide derived [99]. To determine the biochemical machinery of the polypropionates, Schmidt and colleagues first sequenced the bacterial metagenome to discover putative polypropionate synthase genes. While no good candidates were identified from bacteria, they found potential polypropionate synthase genes by examining recently published Elysia spp. genomes and transcriptomes [100,101,102,103]. From E. chlorotica, a representative polypropionate producer, four genomic fatty acid synthase (FAS)-like genes were identified, two of which belonged to primary metabolism, while the remaining two were classified as animal polyketide synthases (PKSs, EcPKS1, and EcPKS2) (Figure 5B). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that EcPKS1 likely recognizes methylmalonyl-CoA as a substrate while EcPKS2 can use malonyl-CoA, therefore, EcPKS1 was investigated for polypropionate biosynthesis. Subsequent in vitro reconstitution of EcPKS1 with methylmalonyl-CoA and NADPH led to production of a triene pyrone and a tetraene pyrone (Figure 5C), the latter of which is consistent with the predicted precursor for tridachione polyprionate natural products [99]. Although tailoring steps (methylation, oxidation, and photochemical) and chain length-determining factors remain elusive, this work illustrates an excellent example of polyketide biosynthesis from an animal source and sets the stage for exploring marine animals as sources of structurally diverse natural products.", "Along with algae and dinoflagellates, marine invertebrates have proven to be lucrative sources of natural products.

Examples of connecting genes to molecules have been illustrated in fish [63], birds [104], and humans [86,87,88,105]. Of particular note is the discovery of the genetic determinant of coloration in parrots [104]. While many bird pigments, such as carotenoids, are derived from dietary origins [106], psittacofulvins pigments, originally isolated from scarlet macaw parrots (Ara macao) (Figure 6A) [107] were hypothesized to be produced de novo based on the lack of pigments identified in blood and diet samples [108]. Budgerigar parrots (Melopsittacus undulatus) are known for their yellow-green coloration, however, after years of captivity a recessive Mendelian blue trait (i.e., blue feathers) has been observed [109,110,111,112]. As no genetic basis for this observed trait was known, Bustamante and coworkers conducted genome-wide association mapping and expression analysis to identify the genetic determinants of feather color [104]. From this, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified within the acyltransferase domain of a putative type-I PKS (MuPKS) (Figure 6B). Heterologous expression of the WT MuPKS in yeast produced identical pigment metabolites to those seen in the WT feather extracts, while heterologous expression of the blue trait MuPKS (with the SNP) produced no such metabolites (Figure 6C). Additional phylogenetic analysis of animal PKS genes revealed a multitude of animals contain PKS genes with variable but similar domain architecture, prompting questions surrounding the evolutionary origin and purpose of animal PKS genes. To begin to address some of these questions, a PKS similar to MuPKS from a non-psittacofulvin producing bird (chicken, GgPKS1) was heterologously expressed in yeast. With GgPKS1 overexpression the two previously identified psittacofulvins were produced as well as two other metabolites with unknown structures. This finding indicates that expression pattern differences, not the gene coding sequence, is responsible for psittacofulvin coloration and variation [104].

Specifically, this study examined potential products associated with either a multi-modular PKS gene (pks-1) or an NRPS gene (nrps-1) encoded by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Figure 7A) [121]. Despite the well-known ability of C. elegans to produce interesting secondary metabolites [122], multi-modular PKS and NRPS genes in metazoans are rare and had not yet been explored. Differential metabolomic analysis of the pks-1 and nrps-1 mutated worms against wildtype worms showed the same two metabolites were absent in both mutants. Together, this suggested that the PKS and NRPS work in tandem to synthesize the metabolites. The molecules, termed nemamide A and B, were subsequently isolated from large quantities of wildtype worms (50 L), which afforded small quantities of each (<80 \u00b5g). Through a combination of NMR, mass spectrometry, Marfey\u2019s analysis, circular dichroism, and bioinformatics, the structures of the nemamides were determined (Figure 7B). Using a GFP transcriptional reporter strain for both pks-1 and nrps-1, the genes were shown to be transcribed at all life stages of the nematodes and colocalized with canal-associated neurons. Further work illustrated that both pks-1 and nrps-1 mutants recovered from starvation slower than wildtype worms, suggesting a potential developmental role for the nemamides [119]. This work epitomizes the potential of genetics-guided natural product discovery in phylogenetically diverse eukaryotes, as it resulted in novel structures with intriguing bioactivities.

These represent prime candidates for future genetics-guided natural product discovery efforts. One such example involves biomineralization in various animals, including zebrafish (Danio renio) [123], Japanese rice fish (Oryzias latipes) [124], and sea urchins (Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus) [124]. In general, biomineralization is the process in which animals synthesize typically rigid chemical structures, often to stiffen or protect softer tissues. Examples of this range from vertebrate bones and teeth to calcium-based shells and coral reefs. In 2015, Hojo et al. investigated the biomineralization products otoliths from O. latipes. Otoliths are produced within vertebrate inner ears and aid in sensing motion, gravity, and balance [124]. They found that an O. latipes mutant unable to produce otoliths has a 9-nucleotide deletion within the ketosynthase domain of a putative PKS gene (OlPKS). In otolith-lacking zebrafish, similar mutations in homologous PKS genes have also been observed, suggesting a conserved function [123]. To validate the role of OlPKS, the entire gene was heterologously expressed in Aspergillus oryzae and the resultant organic extracts were sufficient to restore otolith formation in mutant O. latipes, suggesting the yet to be discovered PKS product(s) serves as an otolith nucleation factor [124]. Bioinformatic analysis of similar animal PKS genes identified a homolog within the sea urchin H. pulcherrimus (hppks-2). Using a morpholino knockdown strategy in H. pulcherrimus, echinoderm embryos with lowered hppks-2 levels exhibited dramatically altered spicule formation, another biomineralization related structure. Together, these data suggest that many animal secondary metabolites, polyketides in particular, could have conserved functions that are understudied.

(A) Psittacofulvins isolated from the scarlet macaw. (B) WT feathers in Melopsittacus undulatus are green. The blue trait was mapped to a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within the MuPKS. (C) Heterologous expression of MuPKS in yeast led to the production of the same polyene pigments found within WT feathers. Heterologous expression of the MuPKS with the blue trait SNP led to no pigment production [104].", "Polyene natural products and their role in pigmentation in birds.
