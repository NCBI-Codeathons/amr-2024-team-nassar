However, it is often difficult to link uncharacterized BGCs with the secondary metabolites they produce. Proteomining refers to the strategy of identifying active BGCs by correlating changes in protein expression with the production of secondary metabolites of interest. In this study, we devised a shotgun proteomics-based workflow to identify active BGCs during fermentation when a variety of compounds are being produced. Mycelia harvested during the non-producing growth phase served as the background. Proteins that were differentially expressed were clustered based on the proximity of the genes in the genome to highlight active BGCs systematically from label-free quantitative proteomics data. Our software tool is easy-to-use and requires only 1 point of comparison where natural product biosynthesis was significantly different. We tested our proteomining clustering method on three Streptomyces species producing different compounds. In Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), we detected the BGCs of calcium-dependent antibiotic, actinorhodin, undecylprodigiosin, and coelimycin P1. In Streptomyces chrestomyceticus BCC24770, 7 BGCs were identified. Among them, we independently re-discovered the type II PKS for albofungin production previously identified by genome mining and tedious heterologous expression experiments. In Streptomyces tenebrarius, 5 BGCs were detected, including the known apramycin and tobramycin BGC as well as a newly discovered caerulomycin A BGC in this species. The production of caerulomycin A was confirmed by LC-MS and the inactivation of the caerulomycin A BGC surprisingly had a significant impact on the secondary metabolite regulation of S. tenebrarius. In conclusion, we developed an unbiased, high throughput proteomics-based method to complement genome mining methods for the identification of biosynthetic pathways in Streptomyces sp.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The Streptomyces sp. are producers of natural products that are often synthesized by genes in proximity in the genome, collectively referred to as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Hopwood, 2007; Medema et al., 2015; Genilloud, 2017). Many of these BGCs share common core genes such as polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), which form an assembly line that elongates the metabolite backbone. The combination of these core genes with various functional groups and structure modifying enzymes in a BGC allows the Streptomyces sp. to produce a diverse variety of compounds that are difficult to efficiently produce through chemical synthesis (Hopwood, 2007; Rossiter et al., 2017; Genilloud, 2018).", "The Streptomyces sp. are producers of natural products that are often synthesized by genes in proximity in the genome, collectively referred to as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Hopwood, 2007; Medema et al., 2015; Genilloud, 2017).

This led to the increased popularity of genome mining, the identification of novel BGCs in newly sequenced genomes via sequence analysis paired with experimental confirmation of the products of the BGCs. One of the most widely used genome mining tools is antiSMASH, which predicts BGCs in the genome and matches the predicted clusters against a database of previously documented BGCs, allowing for rapid identification of putative BGCs in a newly sequenced genome (Blin et al., 2021). Another important genome mining tool is PRISM which uses machine learning to predict the products produced by the identified BGCs (Skinnider et al., 2015). However, putative BGCs predicted by genome mining are not always specific, and many are not actively expressed or \u201csilent.\u201d In addition, since many BGCs are present in a single genome of Streptomyces sp., linking predicted BGCs to their respective metabolites can be challenging.", "The democratization of genome sequencing has revealed the variety of BGCs in the genomes of Streptomyces spp., which contributes to the recent interest in leveraging this genus for synthetic biology applications (Genilloud, 2018).

For example, transcriptomics has been performed on Streptomyces flaveolus (Qu et al., 2011) and on several strains of Salinispora pacifica (Amos et al., 2017) to search for BGCs. However, transcripts have short half-lives in bacteria, making it difficult to determine the optimal time points to capture the shift in expression patterns (Moran et al., 2013). On the contrary, proteins are the actual actors in natural product biosynthesis in real-time; thus, one expects that protein levels should be more reliably correlated with secondary metabolite production (Du and van Wezel, 2018; Ludvigsen and Honor\u00e9, 2018).

They utilized the mass shift that occurs due to the ionization-induced release of 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine to identify spectra corresponding to PKS/NRPS peptides linked to this cofactor. The sequence of these peptides was then determined de novo and reverse translated to develop primers for the targeted PCR study of the gene. To improve the selectivity for peptides of PKS/NRPS, Meier et al. (2009, 2011) developed probes that bind to the conserved active sites or the phosphopantetheinyl cofactor to selectively pull down expressed PKS and NRPS. In another approach, high molecular weight proteins were isolated from streptomycetes to select for PKS and NRPS complexes (Bumpus et al., 2009; Evans et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012, 2013a,2013b). However, these approaches are \u201cbiased,\u201d being able to detect only NRPS and PKS, and do not cover the whole proteome but have the advantage of not requiring the whole genome sequence. To this end, an unbiased method employing shotgun proteomics to compare the proteomes of mycelia grown on different media was proposed (Gubbens et al., 2014).

A 40 \u03bcg aliquots of the protein solution were reduced with 0.1 M dithiothreitol (Sigma) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Exposed cysteine residues were methylated by 0.2 M iodoacetamide (Sigma) in the dark for 30 min, after which the reaction was quenched using an excess of dithiothreitol. The protein solution was diluted with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to a final concentration of 1 M urea. Sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega) was used at a 1:50 trypsin to protein ratio. Trypsin digestion was performed overnight at 37\u00b0C. Formic acid was added to a final concentration of 0.5% to quench the digestion. The peptide mixture was desalted using C18 ZipTip (Merck Millipore) as per the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Desalted peptides were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis.

As such, we hypothesize that the loss of the secondary metabolite BGC expression may be attributed to the loss of caerulomycin A or one of its precursors, which might act as the trigger for secondary metabolite production either by triggering programmed cell death (Tenconi et al., 2018) or through quorum sensing (Koberska et al., 2021).", "Since there was no previous report of the production of caerulomycin A in S. tenebrarius, we sought to further confirm the role of the discovered caerulomycin A BGC by gene knockout.

Since crmA is not a regulatory gene but rather a NRPS that contained a ketosynthase, acyltransferase, acyl-carrier, condensation, adenylation and thiolation domains, this made it unlikely that the overall downregulation of the other BGCs was due to cross-BGC regulation. As such, we hypothesize that the loss of the secondary metabolite BGC expression may be attributed to the loss of caerulomycin A or one of its precursors, which might act as the trigger for secondary metabolite production either by triggering programmed cell death (Tenconi et al., 2018) or through quorum sensing (Koberska et al., 2021).", "Since there was no previous report of the production of caerulomycin A in S. tenebrarius, we sought to further confirm the role of the discovered caerulomycin A BGC by gene knockout. We proceeded to knock out ORF 4229\u20134230 which corresponded to crmA, the core biosynthetic protein for caerulomycin A biosynthesis, to probe how this BGC affects secondary metabolite production of S. tenebrarius. The loss of crmA abolished caerulomycin A production in S. tenebrarius (Figure 4). Surprisingly, knocking out crmA also abolished apramycin production (Supplementary Figure 5). We then took this opportunity to test our proteomining clustering method on strain comparison, by comparing S. tenebrarius \u0394crmA and the WT (Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Data 5).

We first showed that the different phases of the Streptomyces spp. life cycle can be exploited to generate contrasting producing/non-producing states, as demonstrated in a proof of concept in S. coelicolor A3(2). Furthermore, the increase in production of secondary metabolite under nutrient starvation conditions is a widespread phenomenon (Hopwood, 2007; Rigali et al., 2008). This approach reduces the need for formulating different fermentation conditions or prior genetic manipulation to produce such contrast, although these other comparisons can also be used.", "In summary, we developed a proteomining method based on label-free quantitative proteomics of Streptomyces sp.

Our simple algorithm for clustering differentially expressed proteins by proximity in the genome also facilitated the automated and independent identification of potential BGCs. Compared to the method developed by Gubbens et al. (2014) our algorithm integrates gene proximity and protein differential expression to highlight BGCs more systematically with our scoring system and directly from label-free quantitative proteomics data, packaged into a simple script. Furthermore, our workflow is simpler, requiring only a single pair of comparison. Overall, our proposed clustering-based proteomining method should be able to detect BGCs with less bias due to non-reliance on co-factors or high molecular weights of proteins (Meluzzi et al., 2008; Bumpus et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2012). Therefore, our proposed workflow, when combined with traditional genome mining, should be helpful in guiding the researcher to isolate novel secondary metabolites produced by Streptomyces spp.", "In addition, recent advancements in LCMS-based mass spectrometry sample preparation techniques and instruments has allowed label-free quantitative proteomics to sufficiently highlight the numerous differentially expressed proteins, while also having the advantages of lower costs, simpler experiments, and the ability to compare across more sample groups, unlike isobaric labeling methods (Du and van Wezel, 2018).

In the future, our proteomining clustering algorithm could also be applied in conjunction of the use of engineered media composition or specialized fermentation setup to better simulate the natural habitat of Streptomyces sp. which can elicit the expression of silent BGCs (Du and van Wezel, 2018). Another complication is the tendency for Streptomyces sp. to activate multiple BGCs to produce distinct secondary metabolites under similar conditions. While the pool of BGC candidates would have been narrower compared to the total BGCs in the genome, it can still be difficult to unambiguously link the BGC to a secondary metabolite of interest based on proteomining alone, though tools such as antiSMASH, PRISM and BLASTP may be called upon to help narrow down the possibilities. In the future, it will be worthwhile to combine time-series metabolomics with proteomics to reveal temporal correlations between individual secondary metabolite production and protein expression changes, to expedite the association of the BGCs to their products with higher confidence and throughput.", "In terms of limitations, like other expression-based analysis, proteomining is only applicable when the Streptomyces strain is culturable under laboratory conditions and typically relies on nutrient starvation to trigger the production of secondary metabolites (Rigali et al., 2008).
