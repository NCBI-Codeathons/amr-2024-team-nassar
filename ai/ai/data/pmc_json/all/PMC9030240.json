["Surfactin is described as a powerful biosurfactant and is natively produced by Bacillus\u00a0subtilis in notable quantities. Among other industrially relevant characteristics, antimicrobial properties have been attributed to surfactin-producing Bacillus isolates. To investigate this property, stress approaches were carried out with biotechnologically established strains of Corynebacterium glutamicum, Bacillus\u00a0subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida with the highest possible amounts of surfactin. Contrary to the popular opinion, the highest growth-reducing effects were detectable in B. subtilis and E.\u00a0coli after surfactin treatment of 100 g/L with 35 and 33%, respectively, while P. putida showed no growth-specific response. In contrast, other antimicrobial biosurfactants, like rhamnolipids and sophorolipids, showed significantly stronger effects on bacterial growth. Since the addition of high amounts of surfactin in defined mineral salt medium reduced the cell growth of B.\u00a0subtilis by about 40%, the initial stress response at the protein level was analyzed by mass spectrometry, showing induction of stress proteins under control of alternative sigma factors \u03c3B and \u03c3W as well as the activation of LiaRS two-component system. Overall, although surfactin is associated with antimicrobial properties, relatively low growth-reducing effects could be demonstrated after the surfactin addition, challenging the general claim of the antimicrobial properties of surfactin.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis reveals a large number of proteins that enable the efflux of various biologically active components [1]. These include the class of lipopeptides as one of the most important groups of secondary metabolites produced by several Bacillus strains [2]. In the case of the established laboratory strain B. subtilis 168, lipopeptide production is facilitated by two operons (srfAA-AD for surfactin and ppsA-E for plipastatin) encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) [3,4]. Surfactin is the main lipopeptide in B. subtilis and is produced in several grams per litre under optimised conditions [5]. In adapted high cell-density fermentation bioprocesses using B. subtilis 3NA, an amount of about 26 g/L surfactin was produced [6]. To ensure controlled surfactin formation, several regulatory mechanisms are involved in lipopeptide production, such as ComX-mediated quorum sensing and nutrition state sensing regulators [7,8,9]. Posttranslationally, the peptidyl carrier protein domains of three surfactin synthetase subunits (SrfAA, SrfAB, SrfAC) need to be activated by the 4-phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp [10]. In particular, B. subtilis strain 168 exhibits a non-functional sfp version due to a single base duplication, which prevents surfactin formation [11].", "The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis reveals a large number of proteins that enable the efflux of various biologically active components [1].

Based on these structural characteristics, surfactin is reported to have a critical micelle concentration of about 15 mg/L [14]. In addition, antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor and haemolytic properties are attributed to surfactin [15,16,17,18]. In more detail, surfactin facilitates membrane destabilization through incorporation into lipid bilayers, chelation of cations and pore formation [19,20,21].

In addition, efficacy against the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium verticillioides [23] and the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae [24] has been demonstrated. However, most studies report the effect of surfactin when using the whole Bacillus cell culture or the cell-free supernatant after cultivation, which also contain other antimicrobial metabolites such as fengycin, iturin or bacteriocins. Furthermore, other lipopeptides, including iturin and fengycin, can also be purified when surfactin is extracted from the cell-free supernatant, which can lead to combination effects when analysing the impact on microbes [25].

Furthermore, the open question of the impact of a synergistic effect of surfactin with other simultaneously produced antimicrobial compounds on native surfactin production should be answered in the future. Nevertheless, the results show that B. subtilis is able to tolerate significantly higher surfactin titres than those previously described in bioproduction processes. Accordingly, an increase in bacterial surfactin production to more than 100 g/L does not seem to be a limit from the perspective of a negative feedback inhibition of surfactin on B. subtilis growth. A doubling or even a quadrupling of the currently described highest titres therefore seems possible and would facilitate an economic establishment of surfactin as a surfactant alternative on the market.", "The investigation of an initial surfactin stress response of B. subtilis revealed the induction of different regulatory networks associated with the alternative sigma factors \u03c3W and \u03c3B, but also the LiaRS two-component system. Consequently, the activation of both cell wall-specific and general stress responses by surfactin treatment is involved. These findings will help to develop more robust B. subtilis surfactin production strains, potentially leading to increased product-per-biomass yields.", "The investigation of an initial surfactin stress response of B. subtilis revealed the induction of different regulatory networks associated with the alternative sigma factors \u03c3W and \u03c3B, but also the LiaRS two-component system.
