["A close relationship exists between the intestinal microbiota and the circadian rhythm, which is mainly regulated by the central-biological-clock system and the peripheral-biological-clock system. At the same time, the intestinal flora also reflects a certain rhythmic oscillation. A poor diet and sedentary lifestyle will lead to immune and metabolic diseases. A large number of studies have shown that the human body can be influenced in its immune regulation, energy metabolism and expression of biological-clock genes through diet, including fasting, and exercise, with intestinal flora as the vector, thereby reducing the incidence rates of diseases. This article mainly discusses the effects of diet and exercise on the intestinal flora and the immune and metabolic systems from the perspective of the circadian rhythm, which provides a more effective way to prevent immune and metabolic diseases by modulating intestinal microbiota.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "The gut microbiota are mutually restricted and interdependent according to a certain proportion, showing a dynamic ecological balance as a whole. Intestinal flora can be divided into symbiotic bacteria, conditional pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. As the main body of intestinal flora, they have a relatively fixed and stable state and reside in the intestine to jointly maintain the homeostasis of the body [1,2]. Research shows that the composition of intestinal flora changes with dietary intake, and the types of bacteria vary among people of different ages [3,4]. The composition of intestinal flora is also affected by host genetics [5], antibiotic use [6], lifestyle [7] and concomitant diseases [8,9].", "The gut microbiota are mutually restricted and interdependent according to a certain proportion, showing a dynamic ecological balance as a whole.

Among them, the circadian oscillator is the central mechanism driving the circadian rhythm, which can keep the biological rhythm relatively consistent with the circadian rhythm. The generation of circadian rhythm is mainly regulated by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the biological-clock gene in the peripheral tissues [10]. In mammals, the circadian-rhythm axis is composed of the retina, SCN and pineal gland. Their interactions can produce and regulate physiological and behavioral rhythms in the organism. Among them, the SCN, also known as the circadian-rhythm pacemaker, plays a dominant role in the circadian rhythm, which can control the physiological and behavioral rhythms of the organism. At the same time, the peripheral-biological-clock system (mainly including muscle, adipose tissue, liver and intestine) also participates in regulating the circadian rhythm [11]. The biological-clock gene refers to the gene that can control the biological rhythm of organisms. It does not only regulate the sleep cycle and cognitive function of mammals, but also regulates most of their circadian-rhythm cycles in physiological conditions [12].", "Circadian rhythms refer to the continuous changes in the life activities of organisms with a cycle of about 24 h.

Depending on the different metabolic states of the host (normal individuals [13], diabetes [14], obesity [15], hypertension [16], anxiety and cognitive impairment [17]), exercise can have different positive effects on the intestinal flora to promote host health. Studies have shown that the circadian-rhythm oscillation between the activity of the immune system and the function of the immune system is consistent, and that an imbalance in the biological clock will lead to the abnormal response of the immune system. The circadian rhythm plays an important role in the physiological metabolism of the body, and the activity of the intestinal flora also participates in the metabolic process of its host [18,19]. In addition to effective weight loss, fasting can also reduce blood pressure, blood lipid level, improve brain health, enhance immunity, improve intestinal health and enhance circadian rhythm [20]. Fasting can reduce fat deposition, improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, as well as significantly improve the hyperglycemia and pancreatic island function of early diabetes patients, and can also have preventive and therapeutic effects on type 2 diabetes. In addition, fasting can also extend the life of mice [21], improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol without losing weight [22].
