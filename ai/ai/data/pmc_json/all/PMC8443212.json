["Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria present one of the biggest threats to public health; this must not be forgotten while global attention is focussed on the COVID-19 pandemic. Resistant bacteria have been demonstrated to be transmittable to humans in many different environments, including public settings in urban built environments where high-density human activity can be found, including public transport, sports arenas and schools. However, in comparison to healthcare settings and agriculture, there is very little surveillance of AMR in the built environment outside of healthcare settings and wastewater. In this review, we analyse the existing literature to aid our understanding of what surveillance has been conducted within different public settings and identify what this tells us about the prevalence of AMR. We highlight the challenges that have been reported; and make recommendations for future studies that will help to fill knowledge gaps present in the literature.", "Keywords", "Handling Editor: Dr Frederic Coulon", "Introduction", "Introduction", "As early as the 1970s, the twenty-first century was predicted to see humanity enter a new stage of the epidemiological transition (Omran, 2001), in which individual actions and lifestyle choices as much as the biological and physiochemical characteristics of pathogens would have an increasingly strong influence on our health (Roger and Hackenberg, 1987).

The most well-known is methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) which historically has been challenging to treat due to its broad resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, caused by the mecA gene found within a mobile genetic element known as a Staphylococcus Chromosome Cassette mec (SCCmec). There formally are 13 different SCCmec types (Miragaia et al., 2008), which are defined by the composition of the mec complex and chromosome cassette recombinase (ccr) complex.

The most prevalent strain isolated from bus surfaces and passengers\u2019 hands and nasal passages in Lisbon was EMRSA 15 (ST22, SCCmec\n\u00a0type IV, PFGE type A, spa types t2357/t747/t025/t379/t910) which accounted for 29% of MRSA isolates, whereas the most common HA-MRSA isolated from bus surfaces in the United States (US) was USA100 (SCCmec\n\u00a0type II) which accounted for 22.9% of the isolates. Both EMRSA 15 and USA100 were the predominant strains isolated from healthcare facilities in Portugal (Aires-de-Sousa et al., 2008) and the US (Carrel et al., 2015). Moreover, EMRSA 15 in Portugal has also been shown to be carried within the nasal passages of healthy dogs (Coelho et al., 2011) which suggest that this strain can spread outside of hospital settings and cross between the species barrier to be transmitted to and from humans via surfaces in public settings. Both studies also show that the bus surfaces harbour CA-MRSA clones (26% of MRSA isolates from Lisbon were USA300 or ST8, SCCmec type IV and 62.9% of MRSA in the US were USA300 or USA400) that are commonly found to colonise humans in Europe and the US (Glaser et al., 2016).", "HA-MRSA transmission patterns have been detected in the metro system in Guangzhou China in November 2013, however, no isolates were identified as CA-MRSA based on their SCCmec indicating that MRSA was transmitted from a hospital setting although there was no indication on the proximity of metro lines to the hospitals (Peng et al., 2015). The prevalence was low with only 2.5% of the 220 samples being MRSA. Intriguingly, one of the most common MRSA sequence types identified from surfaces in Guangzhou metro system was a ST398 (37.5% of MRSA isolates) which is rare to find in urban settings due to it mainly colonises animals. This suggests that it was spread into this setting by a passenger who was in contact with animals or meat.

(2019) reported that 46.80% of the samples collected from train stations, shopping centres and public areas in hospitals from East and West London, between November 2016 to September 2017, were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and that the prevalence of multidrug resistant isolates recovered in East London was significantly higher (56.7%) compared to West London (49.96%). A significantly higher number of MDR isolates were also recovered from public areas in hospitals (49.5%) than from public areas within the community (40.66%). The authors concluded that the difference between East and West London was due to the differences in population density, whereas the difference found in public areas in hospitals and public areas in the community is explained by the higher use of antibiotics in hospital settings than in the community.", "In studies conducted in London, the proportion of mecA positive isolates ranged from 8.17% to 37% (Cave et al., 2019, Mkrtchyan et al., 2013, Peng et al., 2015, Seng et al., 2017, Xu et al., 2018b) with the highest prevalence of mecA gene reported from areas examined in public restrooms (Mkrtchyan et al., 2013). Only 6.56% of the isolates recovered from a metro station in China were positive to mecA (Peng et al., 2015) but the rate was relatively higher (20.5%) in isolates recovered from a university campus in Thailand (Seng et al., 2017). In addition to this, multilocus sequence types (MLST) of the mecA positive S. epidermidis isolates were determined by Xu et al. (2018b) and Cave et al. (2019). Xu et al. (2018b) found that all mecA positive S. epidermidis isolates had novel ST types, however one of the isolates recovered from a hotel room in London belonged to ST59 (Xu et al., 2018a), a sequence type that can cause infection in animals and humans (Argud\u00edn et al., 2015). In contrast, Cave et al. (2019) whose study recovered all S. epidermidis isolates from public areas in hospitals found that only two out of 17 isolates had novel sequence types.

Isolation of such S. epidermidis linages from public areas in hospitals and hotels could potentially pose an as yet unquantified risk to public health.

This may be due to such bacteria not being as virulent and/or prevalent cause of infection compared to S. aureus and S. epidermidis (Argemi et al., 2019).

High levels of antibiotic resistance found in these areas appears to be linked to closed, crowed environments where there is increased physical contact and AMR genes are able to exchange: the metro system had a higher number of isolates with the mecA and qacA/B (28 and 40% respectively) compared to those found in parks (5.56% for both genes). In the study by Zhou and Wang, (2013), the antibiotics to which the recovered isolates were most often resistant were bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) (38.95%), nitrofurantoin (36.28%) and penicillin (30.49%).

A Class C carbapenemases have also been described; however, they are not considered true carbapenemases as they have a low enzyme\u2019s catalytic efficiency and a permeability defect, which only gives them a slight reduction in susceptibility to carbapenems (Bedeni\u0107 and Sardeli\u0107, 2018). Class A carbapenemases are associated with K. pneumoniae (KPC) as are the less common non-metallocarbapenemase type A (NMC-A) and SME enzymes; Class B carbapenemases are associated with metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBL) including New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (NDM), the IMP family of carbapenemases, and the Verona integron\u2013encoded metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (VIM). Class D carbapenemases are associated with OXA-48-like carbapenemases. Currently only two of the CRE genes (KPC and NDM) are widely spread, with KPC being the most widely disseminated, with 13 known variants of the gene (Perez and Van Duin, 2013). First isolated in North Carolina, USA in 1996, the KPC variants have spread globally and transferred across to other Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter, Serratia, and Salmonella species.

Across their samples, they reported 0.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\u201332\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0coverage of the gene and five of the 18 subway stations they tested harboured unidentified bacteria which were resistant to one of three antibiotics used in the study (kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin).", "Kang et al.

The authors stated that the relative abundance of AMR was higher than that found in drinking water and marine sediments they had previously detected in Hong Kong (Guo et al., 2016) but lower than was reported for the samples recovered from human gut samples in China (Yu et al., 2017). Many of these antibiotic resistance genes encoded for antibiotics used in clinical settings, including vancomycin, erythromycin and methicillin. Furthermore, Kang et al.

The authors used metagenomics to identify that 2,210 out of 4,728 samples had AMR gene sequences, of which the most common antibiotic resistance detected was for macrolides, lincosamides, streptogamines (MLS), and beta lactams; some of the most commonly used antibiotics to treat bacterial infection in humans. Overall, there was a low abundance of AMR genes detected from all cities (AMR classes ranging from 0.1 to 1 Reads Per Kilobase Million (RPKM)) compared to housekeeping genes (10-100RPKM). However, this low RPKM could be explained by AMR classes containing many genes: if individual genes were measured, the RPKM is likely to be higher. In addition, Danko et al. (2021) suggest that these samples may contain undetected AMR genes that have not been previously characterised. The samples contained sequences from hundreds of distinct AMR genes, those these were not distributed evenly across cities. This may be due to differences in the amount of antibiotics used in these areas, urban geographical differences such as population density, as well as the difference in the cities\u2019 individual microbiomes, all of which suggests avenues for further study. Overall, the three most common bacterial phyla across the 60 cities were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes and many of the taxa found in these areas can be associated with human infections including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Klebsiella and Enterobacter species.

These results showed no suggestion that these AMR genes may benefit bacterial survival due to the presence of tricon and methylparaben; however the use of disinfectants could be the cause of AMR presence (Mahnert et al., 2019) as conducting metagenomics analysis the authors found that there was a reduced bacterial diversity and high levels of AMR in areas that was highly maintained for cleanliness (intensive care unit) compared to other built environments. Similar findings were reported by Fahimipour et al.
