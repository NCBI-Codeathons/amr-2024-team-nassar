["Abstract", "Simocyclinones are antibiotics produced by Streptomyces and Kitasatospora species that inhibit the validated drug target DNA gyrase in a unique way, and they are thus of therapeutic interest. Structural approaches have revealed their mode of action, the inducible-efflux mechanism in the producing organism, and given insight into one step in their biosynthesis. The crystal structures of simocyclinones bound to their target (gyrase), the transcriptional repressor SimR and the biosynthetic enzyme SimC7 reveal fascinating insight into how molecular recognition is achieved with these three unrelated proteins.", "Simocyclinones are actinomycete natural products that target bacterial DNA gyrase; structural work has revealed their molecular mode of action, aspects of their biosynthesis and the mechanism underlying their inducible export.", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "The increase in resistance to antimicrobials has become a serious challenge in the 21st Century, with rising antibiotic-resistant pathogens, particularly in hospital settings, and a paucity of new agents becoming available (Boucher et\u00a0al. 2009; Bush et\u00a0al. 2011). It is therefore essential that we continue our search for new antibacterial compounds, particularly novel natural products, which have the possibility of exploiting new chemical space. Actinomycetes, most notably the genus Streptomyces, have proved to be a rich source of bio-active molecules, with most antibiotics in current clinical use being actinomycete natural products or their derivatives (Clardy, Fischbach and Walsh 2006).

DNA topoisomerases (topos) are enzymes found in all organisms that catalyze the interconversions of different topological forms of DNA, e.g. relaxed\u2013supercoiled, knotted\u2013unknotted, catenated\u2013decatenated (Vos et\u00a0al. 2011; Bush, Evans-Roberts and Maxwell 2015) and are essential for DNA replication and transcription (Wang 2002). They are classified as type I or II depending upon whether their reactions proceed via single- or double-stranded breaks in DNA, and further divided into sub-types: IA, B, C and IIA and B, depending of mechanistic and evolutionary considerations (Wang 1996; Forterre et\u00a0al. 2007). DNA gyrase (the target of simocyclinones) is a type IIA topoisomerase, and the only enzyme that can catalyze the introduction of negative supercoils into DNA. It is essential in all bacteria but lacking from animals, including humans, making it an ideal target for antibiotics. The type II topoisomerase in humans, topo II, has been developed as an anti-cancer target (Pommier et\u00a0al. 2010) and can relax and decatenate DNA but cannot supercoil.

The supercoiling reaction involves the wrapping of DNA around the A2B2 complex and the passage of one segment of DNA, termed the \u2018T\u2019 or \u2018transported\u2019 segment, through a double-stranded break in another, the \u2018G\u2019 or \u2018gate\u2019 segment.

As will be shown below, the inhibition of gyrase by simocyclinones occurs by a different, previously unknown, mechanism: they prevent the enzyme from binding DNA. It is possible that this mode of action can be exploited towards the development of novel, clinically relevant antibiotics. It is interesting to note that there are a number of peptide and protein inhibitors that exhibit the three mechanisms of gyrase inhibition (Collin, Karkare and Maxwell 2011). For example, microcin B17, CcdB and ParE can stabilize the cleavage complex, MfpA and Qnr proteins seem to prevent DNA binding, and FicT proteins modify GyrB and prevent ATPase activity (Harms et\u00a0al. 2015).", "DNA gyrase consists of two subunits, GyrA and GyrB, which form an A2B2 complex in the active enzyme (Fig.\u00a02; Collin, Karkare and Maxwell 2011; Bush, Evans-Roberts and Maxwell 2015).

SimX is an efflux pump, a member of the major facilitator superfamily, which exports simocyclinone from the producing organism. simX transcription is repressed by SimR, a TetR-family transcriptional regulator (TFR) that binds to two separate operators in the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed simR and simX genes (Le et\u00a0al. 2009).

The ligand-binding pocket of SimR is unusual; in other characterized TFRs, one ligand-binding pocket is typically contained within each subunit and so, for example, in the closely related protein, ActR, there is only one ligand contact with the second subunit (Willems et\u00a0al. 2008), while in TetR itself there is none (Orth et\u00a0al. 2000). In contrast, the ligand-binding pocket in SimR spans the two protein subunits, with the angucyclinone of SD8 bound in one subunit, while the olivose sugar, tetraene and aminocoumarin parts of the molecule are bound in the other (Le et\u00a0al. 2011b) (Figs 5 and 6). This split binding pocket is \u223c30 \u00c5 in length, with SD8 bound in an extended conformation. Although SD8 has 19 atoms that could potentially participate in hydrogen bonding, there are only five direct hydrogen bonds between SimR and SD8, three with the aminocoumarin and two with the angucyclinone (Fig.\u00a06). However, the dearth of hydrogen bonding is compensated for by extensive van der Waals contacts with the protein along the length of the ligand (Fig.\u00a06). The way cognate ligands are bound by TFRs is highly variable. For example, when the SimR-SD8 structure is compared with that of the complex between the closely related TFR protein ActR and its cognate ligand, the antibiotic actinorhodin, the long axis of the actinorhodin molecule lies almost perpendicular to that of SD8 in the SimR\u2013SD8 structure (Willems et\u00a0al. 2008; Le et\u00a0al. 2011b).", "TFRs function as homodimers, with each subunit having two domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Ramos et\u00a0al. 2005; Yu et\u00a0al. 2010; Cuthbertson and Nodwell 2013).

In contrast, in the SD8-bound form, the side-chain of Arg122 from each subunit projects across the dimer interface into a pocket in the surface of the opposing subunit, potentially acting as locating pins to lock the subunits together (Fig.\u00a05).", "The biosynthetic intermediate simocylinone C4 (SC4) lacks the aminocoumarin ring present in the mature antibiotic (Fig.\u00a01) and is essentially inactive as a DNA gyrase inhibitor; the SD8 IC50 is 0.1 \u03bcM, whereas the SC4 IC50 is >100 \u03bcM (Edwards et\u00a0al. 2009b). However, despite the absence of the aminocoumarin ring, SC4 binds SimR and prevents it from binding DNA (Le et\u00a0al. 2009). The structure of the SimR-SC4 complex has also been determined (Le et\u00a0al. 2011b). Comparison of the SD8-SimR and SC4-SimR structures shows that the two molecules bind SimR in the same way, meaning the parts common to both molecules (the angucyclinone, tetraene and olivose sugar) occupy equivalent positions in the binding pocket. SC4 is slightly less effective than SD8 at derepressing SimR in vitro (Le et\u00a0al. 2009) and this is probably a consequence of the fewer favorable interactions that SC4 makes with the protein, due to the absence of the aminocoumarin. These results show that a pathway intermediate that is not an active antibiotic can induce expression of the efflux pump, and similar observations have been made in other antibiotic pathways, particularly for actinorhodin (Otten, Ferguson and Hutchinson 1995; Jiang and Hutchinson 2006; Ahn et\u00a0al. 2007; Tahlan et\u00a0al. 2007; Ostash et\u00a0al. 2008; Tahlan et\u00a0al. 2008; Willems et\u00a0al. 2008).

In the first step, the hydrophobic environment of the substrate-binding pocket and the juxtaposition of the quinone-like C-ring and the phenyl-like D-ring of the angucyclinone promote the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the proton on the C-8 hydroxyl and the oxygen of the neighboring C-7 carbonyl (Fig.\u00a011b).

For gyrase, it results in inhibition, leading to cell death, for SimR, it results in derepression, leading to antibiotic export, and for SimC7, it results in catalysis, leading to potentiation of an antibiotic. Given that SimC7 is an enzyme, the interaction with the ligand is transient, whereas the interaction with gyrase and SimR will be much longer-lived. In both gyrase and SimR, there are a substantial number of interactions with the terminal aminocoumarin and angucyclinone groups, which are bound by separate subunits; additionally, there are a handful of contacts involving the linker region. The extensive nature of these double-headed interactions leads to very tight binding, commensurate with the physiological consequences. Indeed, molecules lacking either the angucyclinone or the aminocoumarin bind much more weakly to DNA gyrase and, as a consequence, the potency of SD8 as an antibiotic is severely compromised through loss of either \u2018warhead\u2019 (Edwards et\u00a0al. 2009b). The proportion of hydrogen bonds is highest for the complex with gyrase because the binding site is largely solvent-exposed and would otherwise interact with the G-segment DNA, which is polar. In SimR, the ligand-binding site threads through the hydrophobic core of the homodimer, and so the interactions are dominated by van der Waals contacts. In contrast, in the 7-oxo-SD8 complex with SimC7, only the angucyclinone interacts with the enzyme, this being consistent with the site of ketoreduction and the expectation that the natural substrate in vivo is the angucyclinone alone. Given the necessity to precisely position the SimC7 substrate for catalysis, the dearth of hydrogen bonds seems counterintuitive. Indeed, a Ser95 to Ala substitution that removes the only hydrogen bond shows that even this is dispensable. However, the necessity to provide a hydrophobic environment for efficient catalysis would be consistent with a paucity of hydrogen bonding partners and bound water molecules. Instead, the highly constrained nature of the SimC7 active site is a key factor in sterically guiding the substrate to its catalytically competent position adjacent to the cofactor with hydride donor and hydride acceptor atoms juxtaposed. The transient nature of this interaction would be promoted by the negative charge that develops on the phenolate intermediate, which would be unfavorable in the hydrophobic active site, and possibly also by the increased puckering of the angucyclinone ring system that would occur when the C7 keto group is reduced to a hydroxyl.", "In the three different systems we have described in this review, the interaction of the ligand with the protein has entirely different downstream consequences.

In both gyrase and SimR, there are a substantial number of interactions with the terminal aminocoumarin and angucyclinone groups, which are bound by separate subunits; additionally, there are a handful of contacts involving the linker region. The extensive nature of these double-headed interactions leads to very tight binding, commensurate with the physiological consequences. Indeed, molecules lacking either the angucyclinone or the aminocoumarin bind much more weakly to DNA gyrase and, as a consequence, the potency of SD8 as an antibiotic is severely compromised through loss of either \u2018warhead\u2019 (Edwards et\u00a0al. 2009b). The proportion of hydrogen bonds is highest for the complex with gyrase because the binding site is largely solvent-exposed and would otherwise interact with the G-segment DNA, which is polar. In SimR, the ligand-binding site threads through the hydrophobic core of the homodimer, and so the interactions are dominated by van der Waals contacts. In contrast, in the 7-oxo-SD8 complex with SimC7, only the angucyclinone interacts with the enzyme, this being consistent with the site of ketoreduction and the expectation that the natural substrate in vivo is the angucyclinone alone. Given the necessity to precisely position the SimC7 substrate for catalysis, the dearth of hydrogen bonds seems counterintuitive. Indeed, a Ser95 to Ala substitution that removes the only hydrogen bond shows that even this is dispensable. However, the necessity to provide a hydrophobic environment for efficient catalysis would be consistent with a paucity of hydrogen bonding partners and bound water molecules. Instead, the highly constrained nature of the SimC7 active site is a key factor in sterically guiding the substrate to its catalytically competent position adjacent to the cofactor with hydride donor and hydride acceptor atoms juxtaposed. The transient nature of this interaction would be promoted by the negative charge that develops on the phenolate intermediate, which would be unfavorable in the hydrophobic active site, and possibly also by the increased puckering of the angucyclinone ring system that would occur when the C7 keto group is reduced to a hydroxyl.", "Finally, although SD8 itself is not viable as a clinical antibiotic, due at least in part to its poor penetration into bacteria, the way in which it inhibits DNA gyrase is unique. It therefore has the potential to guide the development of new, clinically relevant compounds acting against this enzyme, and the detailed structural information available should potentiate such development.", "Finally, although SD8 itself is not viable as a clinical antibiotic, due at least in part to its poor penetration into bacteria, the way in which it inhibits DNA gyrase is unique.
