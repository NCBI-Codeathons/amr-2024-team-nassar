["Abstract", "Kalimantacin is an antimicrobial compound with strong antistaphylococcal activity that is produced by a hybrid trans\u2010acyltransferase polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase system in Pseudomonas fluorescens \nBCCM_ID9359. We here present a systematic analysis of the substrate specificity of the glycine\u2010incorporating adenylation domain from the kalimantacin biosynthetic assembly line by a targeted mutagenesis approach. The specificity\u2010conferring code was adapted for use in Pseudomonas and mutated adenylation domain active site sequences were introduced in the kalimantacin gene cluster, using a newly adapted ligation independent cloning method. Antimicrobial activity screens and LC\u2010MS analyses revealed that the production of the kalimantacin analogues in the mutated strains was abolished. These results support the idea that further insight in the specificity of downstream domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases is required to efficiently engineer these strains in vivo.", "MicrobiologyOpen\n2016; 5(2): 279\u2013286", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) and polyketides (PKs) are two major classes of secondary metabolites with important therapeutic properties, such as antibiotic, antifungal, immunosuppressive, or antitumor activities. They are produced in bacteria and fungi by multimodular enzymatic assembly lines, known as nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs), respectively (Finking and Marahiel 2004; Smith and Tsai 2007). Due to similarities in their modular organization and biosynthetic strategies, PKSs and NRPSs are able to assemble into hybrid multienzyme complexes (Du et\u00a0al. 2001). Kalimantacin, an antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens BCCM_ID9359, is produced by such a hybrid NRPS\u2010PKS system and its biosynthetic pathway has been fully elucidated (Fig.\u00a01) (Mattheus et\u00a0al. 2010a). The kalimantacin enzymatic assembly line is composed of three polypeptides (Bat1, Bat2, and Bat3), harboring 11 trans\u2010acyltransferase (AT) PKS modules and one NRPS module. The latter incorporates glycine into the PK backbone and is situated in the first module of Bat2 (Bat2mod1). During and after assembly line biosynthesis, kalimantacin is modified by several trans\u2010acting tailoring enzymes (Fig.\u00a01) (Mattheus et\u00a0al. 2010a). Kalimantacin exerts strong antagonistic activity against staphylococci (MIC 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and has moderate activity against enterobacteria (MIC 1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). It acts by inhibiting the trans\u20102\u2010enoyl\u2010 acyl carrier protein (ACP)\u2010reductase (FabI), an enzyme responsible for the final step in bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis (Mattheus et\u00a0al. 2010b).", "Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) and polyketides (PKs) are two major classes of secondary metabolites with important therapeutic properties, such as antibiotic, antifungal, immunosuppressive, or antitumor activities.

NRPs exhibit a high structural diversity, which is partly determined by the substrate specificity of the A domains (Lautru and Challis 2004). Aside from the 22 proteinogenic AA, A domains can additionally introduce nonproteinogenic AAs and \u03b1\u2010hydroxy acids as well as nonsubstituted carboxylic acids. The substrate\u2010binding pocket of A domains is lined by 10 AA residues that determine the nature of the AA that is incorporated into the NRP backbone. This specificity\u2010conferring code can be bioinformatically extracted and enables the structure prediction of new NRPs based on the genomic arrangement of the corresponding biosynthetic genes (Stachelhaus et\u00a0al. 1999; Challis et\u00a0al. 2000; R\u00f6ttig et\u00a0al. 2011). This has already been exploited to rationally alter the specificity of A domains by targeted mutagenesis. So far, only relatively small changes in A domain specificity, for example, Asp to Asn, Glu to Gln, Phe to Tyr, have been achieved in in vitro experiments with purified mutant A domains (Stachelhaus et\u00a0al. 1999; Eppelmann et\u00a0al. 2002; Stevens et\u00a0al. 2006).

Attempts to drastically change the substrate specificity have resulted in a decrease in the A domain activity (Chen et\u00a0al. 2009). In vivo efforts to create NRP analogues with variations in AA composition by targeted mutagenesis of A domains appear to be even more challenging (Eppelmann et\u00a0al. 2002; Uguru et\u00a0al. 2004; Han et\u00a0al. 2012; Thirlway et\u00a0al. 2012).

In vitro analysis of the specificity of the engineered A domains could shed more light on this. Furthermore, working in an in vivo system, downstream domains might not accept the alternative biosynthetic intermediates. Indeed, it has recently been shown that ketosynthase (KS) domains in trans\u2010AT PKSs show specificity to the growing intermediate as well (Jenner et\u00a0al. 2013).

In the kalimantacin cluster, this is expected to be the case for the KS domain of module 2 in Bat2. Engineering the substrate selectivity of this KS domain or replacing it with a KS domain that has an increased substrate tolerance could potentially resolve this issue. Not only the downstream domains could block synthesis, different studies have shown that the acceptor site of the C domain could also possess substrate selectivity (Belshaw et\u00a0al. 1999; Ehmann et\u00a0al. 2000).
