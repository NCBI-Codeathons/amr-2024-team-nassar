["Phytopathogenic cercosporoid fungi have been investigated comprehensively due to their important role in causing plant diseases. A significant amount of research has been focused on the biology, morphology, systematics, and taxonomy of this group, with less of a focus on molecular or biochemical issues. Early and extensive research on these fungi focused on taxonomy and their classification based on in vivo features. Lately, investigations have mainly addressed a combination of characteristics such as morphological traits, host specificity, and molecular analyses initiated at the end of the 20th century. Some species that are important from an economic point of view have been more intensively investigated by means of genetic and biochemical methods to better understand the pathogenesis processes. Cercosporin, a photoactivated toxin playing an important role in Cercospora diseases, has been extensively studied. Understanding cercosporin toxicity in relation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production facilitated the discovery and regulation of the cercosporin biosynthesis pathway, including the gene cluster encoding pathway enzymes. Furthermore, these fungi may be a source of other biotechnologically important compounds, e.g., industrially relevant enzymes. This paper reviews methods and important results of investigations of this group of fungi addressed at different levels over the years.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Cercosporoid fungi (formerly Cercospora s. lat., sensu Chupp, 1954) belong to the Mycosphaerellaceae (Capnodiales, Ascomycota) and are represented by genera and species similar to the genus Cercospora. The affiliation of genera within this group of fungi has been problematic for a long time. Sixteen years ago, Crous and Braun [1] distinguished four true cercosporoid genera, i.e., Cercospora Fresen., Passalora Fr., Pseudocercospora Speg., and Stenella Syd., as well as several others that are morphologically similar (e.g., Cladosporiella, Phacelium, Phaeoisariopsis, Stigmina, Thedgonia). Since that time, extensive analysis of phenotypic characters as well as phylogenetic studies have led to a change in this taxonomic concept, and the genus Zasmidium s. str. has been assigned to cercosporoids instead of Stenella [2,3].", "Cercosporoid fungi (formerly Cercospora s. lat., sensu Chupp, 1954) belong to the Mycosphaerellaceae (Capnodiales, Ascomycota) and are represented by genera and species similar to the genus Cercospora.

However, the sexual stage has not been reported for most cercosporoid species, which is associated with the loss of the ability to form sexual morphs (Figure 1) [4,5,6]. Including those that do form sexual morphs, the group should be classified as hemibiotrophs (facultative saprotrophs), i.e., asexual (anamorphic) stages are parasites (biotrophs), while sexual (teleomorphic) forms develop on dead plant remains (as necrotrophs).

These enzymes are also produced by fungi belonging to the genus Cercospora, where they are responsible for the scavenging of superoxide anion-radicals or the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The presence of superoxide dismutase activity in the extracts of C. nicotianae mycelia has already been shown (43% of superoxide reduction in the pH 7.8). Similarly, the activity of catalase and peroxidase has also been described for this fungus [103].", "In the case of cercosporoid fungi, the photosensitizer connected with the pathogenesis in plants, i.e., cercosporin, absorbs light and is then converted to an activated \u201ctriplet\u201d state. In this activated state, it may react directly with oxygen to produce highly reactive singlet oxygen (1O2). It may also react through a reducing substrate to produce a reduced sensitizer molecule that can damage cells by reacting directly with cellular molecules or by generating free-radical forms of oxygen such as superoxide (\u2022O2\u2212) or the hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) [57,58,90,104]. Cercosporin has been shown to produce both 1O2 and \u2022O2\u2212, but its toxicity has been primarily attributed to the production of 1O2 due to its high quantum yield and the ability of 1O2 quenchers to protect against cercosporin toxicity [105,106,107].", "In the case of cercosporoid fungi, the photosensitizer connected with the pathogenesis in plants, i.e., cercosporin, absorbs light and is then converted to an activated \u201ctriplet\u201d state.

Organisms producing toxins that generate these ROS have evolved mechanisms of resistance, which facilitate undisturbed biomass growth even in the presence of mM concentrations of the toxins [87]. As noted above, enzymatic antioxidant defenses were not shown to play a major role in cercosporin resistance. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase activities in C. nicotianae species were not adequate to provide protection [103]. In terms of general antioxidant defenses, however, the addition of reducing agents such as glutathione, ascorbate, or cysteine to cultures of cercosporin-sensitive fungi significantly reduced its toxicity [89]. The antioxidant vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) was shown to have the greatest role in cercosporin resistance. Pyridoxine and its derivatives produced by Cercospora species can quench both 1O2 and the activated (triplet) form of the toxin to provide resistance [91]. The reductive detoxification of cercosporin, mentioned above, may also be an indication of redox defenses [87,89,108]. The cercosporin observed in hyphae of resistant species like C. kikuchii or C. nicotianae was in a reduced state and was reoxidized after diffusion from the fungal cell surface. In contrast, in cercosporin\u2013sensitive fungi, the toxin was present in its oxidative state. Assays of the reduction of 20 tetrazolium dyes differing in redox potential showed that fungi resistant to cercosporin could reduce more compounds than sensitive species [89]. The redox system of fungi belonging to Cercospora has become the target of modern plant protection. It has been described that the Fenton solutions, e.g., Fenton\u2019s reagent (a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and Fe2+ ions), Fenton-like reagents (a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and Fe3+ ions), or a new type of Fenton\u2019s reagent (hydrogen peroxide, Fe3+ ions, and oxalic acid) are applied onto sugar beet to control the leaf spot induced by C. beticola [100].", "As strong oxidizers, ROS, such as 1O2, \u2022O2\u2212 or \u2022OH, may initiate a series of oxidative reactions in various biological systems.
