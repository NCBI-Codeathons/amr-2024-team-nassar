Nevertheless, the regulatory system governing lasalocid biosynthesis remains obscure. Here, we identified two conserved (lodR2 and lodR3) and one variable (lodR1, found only in Streptomyces sp. strain FXJ1.172) putative regulatory genes through a comparison of the lasalocid biosynthetic gene cluster (lod) from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 with those (las and lsd) from Streptomyces lasalocidi. Gene disruption experiments demonstrated that both lodR1 and lodR3 positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, while lodR2 plays a negative regulatory role. To unravel the regulatory mechanism, transcriptional analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) along with footprinting experiments were performed. The results revealed that LodR1 and LodR2 could bind to the intergenic regions of lodR1\u2013lodAB and lodR2\u2013lodED, respectively, thereby repressing the transcription of the lodAB and lodED operons, respectively. The repression of lodAB\u2013lodC by LodR1 likely boosts lasalocid biosynthesis. Furthermore, LodR2 and LodE constitute a repressor-activator system that senses changes in intracellular lasalocid concentrations and coordinates its biosynthesis. LodR3 could directly activate the transcription of key structural genes. Comparative and parallel functional analyses of the homologous genes in S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T confirmed the conserved roles of lodR2, lodE, and lodR3 in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis. Intriguingly, the variable gene locus lodR1\u2013lodC from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 seems functionally conserved when introduced into S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T. Overall, our findings demonstrate that lasalocid biosynthesis is tightly controlled by both conserved and variable regulators, providing valuable guidance for further improving lasalocid production.", "IMPORTANCE Compared to its elaborated biosynthetic pathway, the regulation of lasalocid biosynthesis remains obscure. Here, we characterize the roles of regulatory genes in lasalocid biosynthetic gene clusters of two distinct Streptomyces species and identify a conserved repressor-activator system, LodR2\u2013LodE, which could sense changes in the concentration of lasalocid and coordinate its biosynthesis with self-resistance. Furthermore, in parallel, we verify that the regulatory system identified in a new Streptomyces isolate is valid in the industrial lasalocid producer and thus applicable for the construction of high-yield strains. These findings deepen our understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in the production of polyether ionophores and provide novel clues for the rational design of industrial strains for scaled-up production.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Actinobacteria, as the most abundant producers of secondary metabolites, produce a variety of complex polyketides with broad-spectrum biological activities (1). Among them, polyether ionophores are a unique class of type I polyketides featuring distinctive tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran rings and are produced exclusively by actinobacteria. These polyketides have been successfully used in veterinary medicine and animal husbandry for more than half a century. Furthermore, they also display promising biological properties, including antiviral, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities (2). The intriguing activities of ionophore agents can be attributed to their ability to chelate metal cations to form lipid-soluble complexes. These complexes facilitate cation transport across plasma membranes, resulting in membrane depolarization and subsequent cell damage or death (2, 3). Lasalocid (4), one of the seven currently marketed carboxylic polyether ionophores, has been validated as a classical anticoccidial drug for poultry and a growth promoter in ruminants (5, 6). Lasalocid selectively inhibits intracellular sporozoites while remaining relatively noninjurious to the host cell, and it has biased antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, whereas most Gram-negative strains are still refractory (7). Recently, this ionophore has been verified as a novel inhibitor that protects cells from multiple deadly bacterial toxins via corrupting vesicular trafficking and Golgi stack homeostasis (8). Moreover, lasalocid and its synthetic analogs have shown high antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines and, simultaneously, lower cytotoxicity toward nontumor cells than cisplatin, which hints at their potential to be developed as candidates for cancer treatment (2, 3, 9, 10).", "Actinobacteria, as the most abundant producers of secondary metabolites, produce a variety of complex polyketides with broad-spectrum biological activities (1).

The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of nigericin (nig) and salinomycin (sln) both contain a single pathway-specific regulatory gene, and the overexpression of these genes greatly enhanced the production of the corresponding polyether ionophores (11, 12). Unlike nig and sln, the BGCs of monensin (mon) and nanchangmycin (nan) each contain multiple regulatory genes that encode regulators belonging to diverse families, including LAL (large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family), SARP (Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins), TetR, and AraC. These regulators form complex coregulatory cascades governing the biosynthesis of monensin and nanchangmycin (13, 14). In addition to the above-mentioned cluster-situated regulators (CSRs), the global transcriptional regulator DasR has also been proven to increase monensin production in Streptomyces cinnamonensis (15). However, although the biosynthetic pathway for lasalocid has been well elucidated (16), the regulatory mechanism in lasalocid production remains obscure, which hinders its titer improvement and further industrialization. Meanwhile, comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses have revealed that even BGCs encoding the same molecule may vary in both gene content and organization (17\u201319). These homologous BGCs normally keep conserved biosynthetic genes and relatively variable regulatory genes, the latter of which promote BGC diversification and can serve as evolutionary evidence (20, 21). Several BGCs for polyether ionophores have been identified, while little is known about their regulatory diversification. Comparative dissection of their regulation systems may provide valuable insights into the evolution of these BGCs.", "Given the broad-spectrum bioactivities and promising applications of polyether ionophores, increasing numbers of studies have been performed on the regulation of their biosynthesis.

To unveil the regulatory mechanism of LodR1, we performed transcriptional analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and DNase I footprinting experiments. Cotranscriptional analysis of lod by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed the existence of at least five transcriptional units (lodAB, lodED, lodR2\u2013F, lodH\u2013P, and lodST) and four individually transcribed genes (lodR1, lodC, lodG, and lodQ) (Fig.\u00a03A). It is noteworthy that lodR2 was cotranscribed with lodR3 and lodF in one operon. Next, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted to investigate the effect of lodR1 disruption on lasalocid biosynthesis at the transcriptional level. Total RNAs of FXJ1.172-WT and the \u0394lodR1 mutant were isolated at days\u20093 to 5. These time points were selected because lasalocid was initially detected in FXJ1.172-WT on the third day of fermentation, followed by a substantial increase in production over the next 2\u2009days (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Compared to that in FXJ1.172-WT, the transcription of lodA\u2013lodC was greatly enhanced in the \u0394lodR1 mutant (Fig.\u00a03B), implying that LodR1 negatively regulates lodA\u2013lodC. In contrast, the transcript levels of the structural genes (lodF, lodG, lodH\u2013P, and lodST) were decreased in the \u0394lodR1 mutant (Fig.\u00a03B). To determine the target genes of LodR1, EMSAs were performed with all potential interoperonic promoters indicated in Fig.\u00a03A and the intergenic region of lodR2\u2013lodR3 (a possible intraoperonic promoter may exist in this region of over 500\u2009bp in length). Recombinant protein LodR1-His6 was purified from Escherichia coli C41(DE3) containing expression plasmid pET23b::lodR1. The result showed that LodR1 could specifically bind to the intergenic region of lodR1\u2013lodA (PR1\u2013A) rather than to the other promoter regions in lod or the promoter region of hrdB (Fig.\u00a04A and Fig. S2). LodR1 comprises an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain and shows high identity to SCO6121 from Streptomyces coelicolor and SVEN_3912 from Streptomyces venezuelae (both with 88% identity). To investigate the potential substrate of the ligand-binding domain in LodR1, EMSAs were performed with PR1\u2013A in the presence of different antibiotics (including lasalocid as the most probable ligand and other antibiotics with structural diversity, such as ampicillin, apramycin, and chloromycetin). Yet no perturbation of the DNA-binding activity of LodR1 was observed (data not shown), indicating that these antibiotics are not ligands of LodR1. To further elucidate the exact DNA-binding sites of LodR1, DNase I footprinting was carried out with probe PR1\u2013A. The results showed that LodR1 protected a region from nucleotide (nt) \u221252 to nt +38 relative to the lodA transcription start point (TSP) (Fig.\u00a04B).

Together, these data suggest that LodR1 directly represses the expression of lodAB.

As las and lsd are very similar clusters from the same species, we then selected las (which is from the publicly available S. lasalocidi type strain) to compare the functions of its regulatory genes with those in lod. Homologs of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 were identified in las, which have been designated las2, las3, and las4, respectively (22). To verify the role of these genes in lasalocid biosynthesis, the corresponding disruption mutants (\u0394las2, \u0394las3, and \u0394las4) were constructed from the S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T wild type (31180-WT). Compared to that of 31180-WT, the lasalocid yield of the \u0394las2 mutant was greatly reduced (from 33.8 to 4.7\u2009mg/L), and that of the \u0394las3 mutant was increased (from 33.8 to 112.5\u2009mg/L), while lasalocid was no longer detected in the \u0394las4 mutant (Fig.\u00a07A). Complementation with the genes in the disruption mutants restored the yields (Fig.\u00a07A). To verify the functional conservation of las4 and its homolog lodR3, cross-complementation of the two genes was conducted. As a result, both the \u0394lodR3 mutant cross-complemented with las4 and the \u0394las4 mutant cross-complemented with lodR3 could restore lasalocid production to the level of the WT strains (Fig.\u00a07B). Cotranscriptional analysis of las revealed the existence of at least four transcriptional units (las1\u20132, las3\u20135, lasAI\u2013lasAVII, and lasCB) and two individual transcriptional genes (las6 and las7) (Fig. S4). Similar to their homologs in lod, las3\u20135 form a single operon. Likewise, RT-qPCR analysis of las genes in 31180-WT and the disruption mutants displayed transcriptional patterns similar to those observed for lod genes in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (Fig.\u00a07C). Moreover, soluble Las3-His6 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the expression plasmid pET28a::las3. Next, EMSAs and footprinting assays were performed to determine its target genes and binding sequences. As expected, Las3-His6 formed complexes with the intergenic region of las2\u2013las3 and protected a region from nt \u221244 to nt +11 relative to the las2 TSP (Fig.\u00a07D). Analysis of the binding sites revealed an 8-bp palindromic sequence near the las2 TSP (consensus, 5\u2032-CATTMRTT-3\u2032 [where M is C or A and R is A or G]) (Fig.\u00a07D), which is similar to the 5\u2032-CATTCRT-3\u2032 (where R is A or G) sequence found in the lodR2\u2013lodE intergenic region from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172. All of these results are consistent with those for Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, indicating a conserved regulatory mechanism of lasalocid biosynthesis in the two species. Based on the above-described regulatory studies, high-yield lasalocid-producing strains were constructed by overexpressing las4 in the \u0394las3 mutant via a multicopy vector, pKC1139::PkasO*las4, or a single-site integrative vector, pSET152::PkasO*las4. The resultant mutants, \u0394las3-1139-las4OE and \u0394las3-152-las4OE, enhanced their lasalocid yields by 5.1 and 6.8 times, respectively, compared to 31180-WT (Fig.\u00a07A). Overall, by the simultaneous disruption of the negative regulatory gene las3 and the overexpression of the positive regulatory gene las4, we obtained high-yield strains with lasalocid production of up to 230\u2009mg/L.", "S. lasalocidi strains are used as industrially valuable lasalocid producers, and thus, the regulatory mechanism of their lasalocid biosynthesis is worth dissecting for the construction of high-yield strains. As las and lsd are very similar clusters from the same species, we then selected las (which is from the publicly available S. lasalocidi type strain) to compare the functions of its regulatory genes with those in lod. Homologs of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 were identified in las, which have been designated las2, las3, and las4, respectively (22). To verify the role of these genes in lasalocid biosynthesis, the corresponding disruption mutants (\u0394las2, \u0394las3, and \u0394las4) were constructed from the S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T wild type (31180-WT). Compared to that of 31180-WT, the lasalocid yield of the \u0394las2 mutant was greatly reduced (from 33.8 to 4.7\u2009mg/L), and that of the \u0394las3 mutant was increased (from 33.8 to 112.5\u2009mg/L), while lasalocid was no longer detected in the \u0394las4 mutant (Fig.\u00a07A). Complementation with the genes in the disruption mutants restored the yields (Fig.\u00a07A). To verify the functional conservation of las4 and its homolog lodR3, cross-complementation of the two genes was conducted. As a result, both the \u0394lodR3 mutant cross-complemented with las4 and the \u0394las4 mutant cross-complemented with lodR3 could restore lasalocid production to the level of the WT strains (Fig.\u00a07B). Cotranscriptional analysis of las revealed the existence of at least four transcriptional units (las1\u20132, las3\u20135, lasAI\u2013lasAVII, and lasCB) and two individual transcriptional genes (las6 and las7) (Fig. S4). Similar to their homologs in lod, las3\u20135 form a single operon. Likewise, RT-qPCR analysis of las genes in 31180-WT and the disruption mutants displayed transcriptional patterns similar to those observed for lod genes in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (Fig.\u00a07C).

Our results reveal that lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species is controlled by one variable and two conserved regulatory systems, providing an understanding of the regulatory diversification and mechanism. To our surprise, no intact homologs of lodR1\u2013lodC were identified in the NCBI nucleotide database. The presence of this variable locus in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 could be partially ascribed to the divergent evolution of the regulation of lasalocid biosynthesis among streptomycetes. The distant phylogenetic relationship between Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 and S. lasalocidi (96.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and 81.7% genome-wide average nucleotide identity) (24) and their disparate soil origins, red soil in China (25) and park soil in the United States (34), respectively, both support the divergent-evolution hypothesis. Nevertheless, more lasalocid BGCs are needed to reconstruct an evolutionary roadmap of the biosynthesis regulation of this polyether. The lsd2 gene, encoding a putative IclR family protein (23), might also have a regulatory role in lasalocid biosynthesis in S. lasalocidi ATCC 35851, albeit the whole sequence of lsd needs to be confirmed by genome sequencing. It was unexpected that the constitutive heterologous expression of lodA\u2013lodC from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 also resulted in the diminished production of lasalocid in S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T. This result suggests that these ORFs exclusive to lod can play a general role in the regulation of lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species. Although we attributed the undisturbed lasalocid production in the mutant strain 31180-R1ABC to the inhibition of lodA\u2013lodC expression by LodR1, we cannot exclude another possibility, that all of these genes are not well expressed in the heterologous host, and more details are needed to further check whether the repression of the expression of lodA\u2013lodC by LodR1 is functionally conserved in S. lasalocidi. Additionally, based on their proposed roles (Table\u00a01), we presumed that lodA\u2013lodC might be involved in the biosynthesis of an unknown molecule, which shares substrates with lasalocid biosynthesis, thus leading to the reduced production of lasalocid. However, no additional metabolites were detected in S. coelicolor M1146 or S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T derivatives containing heterologously expressed lodA\u2013lodC (data not shown). Notably, S. lasalocidi has only about 1/3 of LodC encoded within its lasalocid BGC, which keeps only a residue of the conserved domain found in LodC and thus looks like a truncated and useless protein (Table\u00a01). Our further work will focus on functional analyses of lodA, lodB, and lodC to determine how much of the reduced lasalocid production in different strains is due to lodAB versus lodC and to uncover their repression mechanism in lasalocid biosynthesis.", "Multiple regulatory genes coexist in lasalocid BGCs, but they may not form the complex coregulatory cascade process seen in the biosynthesis of monensin and nanchangmycin (13, 14).

Our further work will focus on functional analyses of lodA, lodB, and lodC to determine how much of the reduced lasalocid production in different strains is due to lodAB versus lodC and to uncover their repression mechanism in lasalocid biosynthesis.", "CSRs are often pathway-specific regulators that function as switches controlling the onset of antibiotic production (32). We used the consensus binding sequences found for LodR1 and LodR2 as queries for a local BLAST search against the genomes of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 and S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T, and we identified no other homologs. Thus, these regulators may not bind to the promoter regions of other genes, indicating that they tend to function as pathway-specific regulators instead of pleiotropic regulators. Nevertheless, antibiotics as well as their intermediates from the biosynthetic pathways can also modulate the activity of their cognate CSRs (35). This generates feedback regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis, which is important for self-protection against the overproduction of antibiotics (32, 36, 37). In this study, we demonstrate that lasalocid specifically binds to the MarR family transcription repressor LodR2 and causes its dissociation from the promoter region of lodR2\u2013lodE (Fig.\u00a05B), thus activating the transcription of lodE. This finding coincides with the defining feature of MarR family regulators: they normally respond to specific ligands, resulting in attenuated DNA-binding activity and often the derepression of target gene transcription (38). Recently, a polyether antibiotic, calcimycin, has also been proven to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of its cognate CSR CalR3, which subsequently initiates the expression of the calcimycin transporter-encoding gene calT (39). Our results further verify that polyether antibiotics can act as modulating ligands of their cognate CSRs, and more polyether ionophores should be used to test the ligand-binding specificity of LodR2 in future studies. The transporter LodE is also crucial for lasalocid biosynthesis because disruption of lodE results in reduced lasalocid production and an increased ratio of intracellular/extracellular lasalocid concentrations. It is noteworthy that the residual production of lasalocid in the \u0394lodE mutant implies the existence of other efflux systems in the producer strain, as seen in the salinomycin producer Streptomyces albus BK3-25 (40). Intriguingly, the \u0394lodE mutant has an intracellular level of lasalocid equivalent to that of FXJ1.172-WT at day 4 but exhibits a greatly reduced transcriptional profile (Fig.\u00a03B and Fig.\u00a05F). A possible explanation for these differences observed is as follows. Lasalocid acts as an ionophore antibiotic, which facilitates cation transport across plasma membranes. Although the intracellular concentration of the lodE mutant is similar to that of FXJ1.172-WT at day 4, there are still significant differences between the intracellular and extracellular lasalocid concentrations in the \u0394lodE mutant. This may lead to the imbalance of ions across the membrane and subsequent cell damage. The cells may sense the changes in ion concentrations and thus downregulate the expression of lod to avoid self-damage.

In the early stage of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 growth, LodR2 specifically binds to the bidirectional promoter region between lodR2 and lodE, inhibiting the transcription of these two genes and part of lodR3. Meanwhile, lodR3 has a separate promoter of its own, and LodR3 can initiate the transcription of most structural genes, leading to the production of lasalocid. When lasalocid accumulates and reaches a certain threshold in the cells, its allosteric interaction with LodR2 induces a conformational change, causing the dissociation of LodR2 from the lodE promoter region. Subsequently, the strong expression of lodE, which encodes an antibiotic efflux pump, results in a drop in the intracellular lasalocid concentration and then the continuous production of lasalocid. Thus, with the LodR2\u2013LodE system, the concentration of lasalocid in the producing strain is controlled at an appropriate level to avoid self-inhibition. Moreover, LodR1 positively regulates lasalocid biosynthesis by repressing the expression of adjacent lodA\u2013lodC, which seems to serve as an alternative regulatory system in addition to the conserved LodR2-LodE and LodR3 systems. In addition, a previously neglected gene, lodQ (homologous to las7), was unexpectedly identified as a putative target gene of LodR3 in gusA transcriptional fusion assays (Fig.\u00a06B). lodQ (las7) encodes a hypothetical protein with no proposed function in lasalocid biosynthesis. However, the disruption of las7 led to a remarkable decrease in lasalocid production in S. lasalocidi (Minghao Liu, Kairui Wang, and Ying Huang, unpublished data), implying an important role of lodQ/las7 in lasalocid biosynthesis. Thus, the detailed function of lodQ/las7 deserves further investigation. Based on our results, multiple genetic modifications can be performed to further improve lasalocid yields. These may include the overexpression of odR3 (las4 or lsd8), lodE (las2 or lsd5), and dasR-like positive pleiotropic regulatory genes in a \u0394lodR2 (\u0394las3 or \u0394lsd6\u20137) mutant.", "Taken together, we propose a plausible regulatory model for lasalocid biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a08).
