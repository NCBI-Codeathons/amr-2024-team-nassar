["The marine Streptomyces harbor numerous biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) with exploitable potential. However, many secondary metabolites cannot be produced under laboratory conditions. Co-culture strategies of marine microorganisms have yielded novel natural products with diverse biological activities. In this study, we explored the metabolic profiles of co-cultures involving Streptomyces sp. 2-85 and Cladosporium sp. 3-22\u2014derived from marine sponges. Combining Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking analysis with natural product database mining, 35 potential antimicrobial metabolites annotated were detected, 19 of which were exclusive to the co-culture, with a significant increase in production. Notably, the Streptomyces-Fungus interaction led to the increased production of borrelidin and the discovery of several analogs via molecular networking. In this study, borrelidin was first applied to combat Saprolegnia parasitica, which caused saprolegniosis in aquaculture. We noted its superior inhibitory effects on mycelial growth with an EC50 of 0.004 mg/mL and on spore germination with an EC50 of 0.005 mg/mL compared to the commercial fungicide, preliminarily identifying threonyl-tRNA synthetase as its target. Further analysis of the associated gene clusters revealed an incomplete synthesis pathway with missing malonyl-CoA units for condensation within this strain, hinting at the presence of potential compensatory pathways. In conclusion, our findings shed light on the metabolic changes of marine Streptomyces and fungi in co-culture, propose the potential of borrelidin in the control of aquatic diseases, and present new prospects for antifungal applications.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Sponges serve as reliable sources for isolating novel marine actinomycete species and natural products. Chemical defense is an important adaptation for sponges to deter predators and competitors, with diverse bioactive compounds identified such as sterols, nucleosides, cyclic peptides, and alkaloids [1]. Interestingly, these compounds are not exclusively synthesized by sponges but by their microbial symbionts [2]. Marine actinomycetes are recognized as a rich source for marine drug discovery. Adapted to the unique conditions of marine environments, such as high pressure, high salinity, and nutrient deficiencies, marine actinomycetes produce secondary metabolites distinct from their terrestrial counterparts [3]. Streptomyces spp. produce over 30 secondary metabolites on average, making them prolific secondary metabolite producers, which contributes to over 80% of bioactive compound production from natural sources [4]. However, microbial genome sequence analyses indicate that a single genome may contain 20\u201380 distinct BGCs, most of which are cryptic and cannot be expressed under standard laboratory culture conditions [5]. This suggested that the metabolic capabilities of bacteria exceeded what could be demonstrated in the laboratory due to severe gene silencing or low synthesis yields, making it challenging for analytical methods to detect these substances.", "Sponges serve as reliable sources for isolating novel marine actinomycete species and natural products.

For example, the OSMAC strategy was used to identify Terrosamycins A and B, as well as two cyclic polyethers with anti-breast cancer activity from Streptomyces sp. RKND004 [7]. In addition, co-culture is another promising approach to activating novel secondary metabolites in marine actinomycetes by mimicking microbial interactions in natural environments. This approach stimulates the expression of cryptic BGCs by promoting interactions, defense, communication, and metabolite competition [8]. Moreover, marine sponges, associated with rich microorganisms, serve as natural microbial fermenters, providing abundant microbial resources and environments for co-culture. Common modes of co-culture include bacteria-bacteria, fungus-fungus, and bacterial-fungal co-cultures. For example, co-culturing Janthinobacterium sp.

The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of (A) water with 0.1% ammonium acetate (v/v) and (B) acetonitrile and was pumped at a rate of 3 mL/min. 100 \u03bcL of sample solution (5 mg/mL) was injected. The gradient elution program was from 5% B to 95% B to yield 4 fractions. Antimicrobial activity was checked, and the most active fraction (fraction A) was used for further analysis. Fraction A was further purified using an Agilent HPLC system using an Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 column (4.6 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u00b5m) with gradient elution as follows: (A) water with 0.1% ammonium acetate; (B) acetonitrile; 5\u201340% B (0\u20135.0 min); 40\u201346% (5.1\u201345.0 min); 46\u201395% B (45.1\u201355.0 min); 95\u20135% B (55.1\u201356.0 min); 5% B (56.1\u201360.0 min) with a 1 mL/min flow led to the isolation of 16 mg of compound N5.", "The co-culture of Streptomyces sp. 2-85 and Cladosporium sp. 3-22 (PDB, pH7.0) (2 L) was extracted with EtOAc, yielding a crude extract (446.6 mg) following the same extraction steps as described above.
