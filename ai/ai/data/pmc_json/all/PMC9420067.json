["Abstract", "Escherichia coli O157:H7 is an important food-borne and water-borne pathogen that causes hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans and may cause serious morbidity and large outbreaks worldwide. People with bloody diarrhea have an increased risk of developing serious complications such as acute renal failure and neurological damage. The hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a serious condition, and up to 50% of HUS patients can develop long-term renal dysfunction or blood pressure-related complications. Children aged two to six years have an increased risk of developing HUS. Clinical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infections\u00a0show fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. The EPEC reservoir is unknown but is suggested to be an asymptomatic or symptomatic child or an asymptomatic adult carrier. Spreading is often through the fecal-oral route. The prevalence of EPEC in infants is low, and EPEC is highly contagious in children. EPEC disease in children tends to be clinically more severe than other diarrheal infections. Some children experience persistent diarrhea that lasts for more than 14 days. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are a compelling cause of the problem of diarrheal disease. ETEC strains are a global concern as the bacteria are the leading cause of acute watery diarrhea in children and the leading cause of traveler\u2019s diarrhea. It is contagious to children and can cause chronic diarrhea that can affect the development and well-being of children. Infections with diarrheagenic E. coli are more common in African countries. Antimicrobial agents should be avoided in the acute phase of the disease since studies showed that antimicrobial agents may increase the risk of HUS in children. The South African National Veterinary Surveillance and Monitoring Programme for Resistance to Antimicrobial Drugs has reported increased antimicrobial resistance in E. coli. Pathogenic bacterial strains have developed resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents due to antimicrobial misuse. The induced heavy metal tolerance may also enhance antimicrobial resistance. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance depends on the type of the antimicrobial agent, bacterial strain, dose, time, and mode of administration. Developing countries are severely affected by increased resistance to antimicrobial agents due to poverty, lack of proper hygiene, and clean water, which can lead to bacterial infections with limited treatment options due to resistance.", "Keywords", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Escherichia coli (E. coli) was first described in 1885 by Theodor Escherich.1 It is a Gram-negative, bar cylindrical shape-like structure, with flagella, non-sporulating, and facultative anaerobic bacteria,1,2 classified as one of the most genetically versatile bacterial species,2 belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family.2,3 It is generally motile by peritrichous flagella, regularly found within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of humans and vertebrate animals,4,5 and spread by fecal contamination.6 It can also be found due to contamination during food animal slaughter, but in most cases, it is found in soil, water6,7 and food7 due to fecal contamination,7 and those environments are referred to as secondary habitats2 which are becoming an ecological issue of significance,7 while the gut of vertebrates (mammals and birds)5 is referred to as its primary habitats where the bacterium lives as a commensal.2 Therefore, there are comprehensively two types of E. coli: commensal and pathogenic E. coli.4", "Escherichia coli (E. coli) was first described in 1885 by Theodor Escherich.1 It is a Gram-negative, bar cylindrical shape-like structure, with flagella, non-sporulating, and facultative anaerobic bacteria,1,2 classified as one of the most genetically versatile bacterial species,2 belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family.2,3 It is generally motile by peritrichous flagella, regularly found within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of humans and vertebrate animals,4,5 and spread by fecal contamination.6 It can also be found due to contamination during food animal slaughter, but in most cases, it is found in soil, water6,7 and food7 due to fecal contamination,7 and those environments are referred to as secondary habitats2 which are becoming an ecological issue of significance,7 while the gut of vertebrates (mammals and birds)5 is referred to as its primary habitats where the bacterium lives as a commensal.2 Therefore, there are comprehensively two types of E. coli: commensal and pathogenic E. coli.4", "Commensal E. coli bacteria are essential as a major aspect of the typical gut flora and contrbiute to the innate and adaptive immunity, and additionally play a significant role in the GIT.1,2 Extrapathogenic E. coli can be categorized into different principle genetic groupings which include one of the phylogroups A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F, and clade I.2 Group A usually represents isolates \u00a0from the duodenum, ileum, and colon.2", "Commensal E. coli bacteria are essential as a major aspect of the typical gut flora and contrbiute to the innate and adaptive immunity, and additionally play a significant role in the GIT.1,2 Extrapathogenic E. coli can be categorized into different principle genetic groupings which include one of the phylogroups A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F, and clade I.2 Group A usually represents isolates \u00a0from the duodenum, ileum, and colon.2", "The pathogenic E.coli is classified into serotypes due to distinctive exterior differences of the antigens, as they can be speculated by distinguishing genes involved in antigen synthesis or identified by agglutination assays.4 However, different studies that have been conducted over the past years for the identification and analyses of E. coli using various methodologies were not able to distinguish any meaningful differences regarding virulence profiles and genetics in various E. coli pathotypes irrespective of the host origin.

However, E. coli may additionally carry F (fimbria) and K (capsule) antigens.4\nE. coli bacteria have optimal conditions for becoming pathogenic such as ideal intestinal conditions, receptors, temperature, and genetic synthesis (the ability to transform or maintain pathogenic genes and maintain resistance genes).1,26 There are some important diarrheagenic pathogenic types (pathotypes) of E. coli such as E. coli that produce Shiga toxins (STEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC), Shigella/enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC).26 Diarrhoea due to E. coli is classified particularly as a leading cause of mortality and desolation in nations that are still developing associated with bacterial infections among other pathogens. Infectious diarrhoea is associated with moderate mortality and is generally less severe in industrialized countries but affects many people and represents a significant disease burden.2", "A particular combination of virulence genes gives E. coli the potential to be pathogenic and cause certain diseases in humans and animals. E. coli with virulence genes belong within the \u201cpathogenic form\u201d defined by the disease they cause,4 but individual strains can have virulence attributes in excess of one pathotype. There are six commonly recognized pathogenic E. coli types.

There is a great concern about the proper implementation of hygiene protocol in livestock production systems.4,28 It is estimated that approximately 70% to 95% of cases reported worldwide are caused by the pathogenic form of E. coli. In addition, these bacterial strains cause more infections in the chicken and poultry industries around the world and are greatly affected by the great financial burden.6,7 In this regard, poultry products are an important source of food-derived and antibacterial resistant E. coli strains in humans which may cause infectious diseases.6,7,29 Blanco et al reported that STEC was detected using a variety of techniques, including serotypes widely used to classify E. coli strains. The H antigen from the flagella protein and the O antigen detected by the polysaccharide portion of the cell wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are used to classify the serotypes of E. coli isolates.30,31 Approximately there are about 174 O-antigens,29,31 numbered 1 to 181, excluding numbers 31, 47, 67, 72, 93, 94 and 122.

In addition, Nigeria has recently reported that a significant increase in the consumption of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine, which is not like the region\u2019s annual livestock rate.191", "Data from various surveys conducted in Nigeria,151 Zambia,192 and South Africa31 have reported that tetracyclines and (mainly penicillin) are the top antimicrobials commonly used in livestock agriculture for the sale of antimicrobial agents for livestock. It shows that it is one of the substances. Sulfonamides and macrolides are also commonly used antibacterial agents, and this last group (especially concerning tylosin) is also widely marketed in South Africa when it comes to the treatment and prevention of animal diseases.31 It has been recorded as a growth promoter registered below therapeutic doses.31 Equally concerned is the improper use of fluoroquinolones in veterinary sector in other parts of Africa as reported from a survey in southwestern Nigeria.191 A study conducted in Ghana included 395 livestock farmers engaged in intensive or large-scale agriculture about how to use antimicrobials.193 Most farmers use veterinary drugs primarily to prevent illness and then use two purposes, prevention and treatment, treatment only, and rarely growth promotion. Of course, it is of importance to note that the data accumulated from pet owners were self-reported.191-194 This has certain restrictions.
