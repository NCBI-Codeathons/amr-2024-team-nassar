["Abstract", "Co\u2010culturing the bacterium Streptomyces rapamycinicus and the ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans has previously been shown to trigger the production of orsellinic acid (ORS) and its derivates in the fungal cells. Based on these studies it was assumed that direct physical contact is a prerequisite for the metabolic reaction that involves a fungal amino acid starvation response and activating chromatin modifications at the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). Here we show that not physical contact, but a guanidine containing macrolide, named polaramycin B, triggers the response. The substance is produced constitutively by the bacterium and above a certain concentration, provokes the production of ORS. In addition, several other secondary metabolites were induced by polaramycin B. Our genome\u2010wide transcriptome analysis showed that polaramycin B treatment causes downregulation of fungal genes necessary for membrane stability, general metabolism and growth. A compensatory genetic response can be observed in the fungus that included upregulation of BGCs and genes necessary for ribosome biogenesis, translation and membrane stability. Our work discovered a novel chemical communication, in which the antifungal bacterial metabolite polaramycin B leads to the production of antibacterial defence chemicals and to the upregulation of genes necessary to compensate for the cellular damage caused by polaramycin B.", "Berger, H.\n, \nBacher, M.\n, \nLabuda, R.\n, \nEppel, I.M.\n, \nBayer, F.\n, \nSulyok, M.\n et al.

However, competition for nutrients, water and space by other organisms such as bacteria may urge fungi to produce defence or signalling compounds, for example antibiotics or other toxic compounds, collectively known as secondary metabolites (SMs), that suppress competitors (De Boer et al.,\u00a02005; de Menezes et al.,\u00a02017; Rousk & B\u00e5\u00e5th,\u00a02007). The same principle is used by pathogenic fungi which use both extracellular proteins and an arsenal of toxins to penetrate host cells and suppress defence mechanisms, respectively (Doehlemann et al.,\u00a02017). Apart from their toxic properties, some of these substances are also known to serve as signalling molecules, e.g. for fungal reproduction (Rodriguez\u2010Urra et al.,\u00a02012), establishment and maintenance of endophytic or symbiotic associations (Chujo et al.,\u00a02019) or pathogenesis\u2010related effectors (Boenisch & Sch\u00e4fer,\u00a02011; Pusztahelyi et al.,\u00a02015). Each fungal species contains genes coding for the biosynthesis of many different SMs but at a given environmental or developmental condition only a specialized set of these secreted molecules is produced. This condition\u2010specific metabolic signature is regulated by genetic signalling networks that have evolved as energy\u2010saving modules for these demanding biosynthetic processes (Gacek & Strauss,\u00a02012; Macheleidt et al.,\u00a02016; Yu & Keller,\u00a02005). In many cases the signal triggering transcriptional activation of the biosynthetic genes is connected to nutrient starvation or the onset of reproductive development (Nemeth et al.,\u00a02016; Tag et al.,\u00a02000). But there are other examples in which rich nutrient sources and active growth is correlated with the production of SMs, such as for the production of siderophores that are required for iron acquisition and metabolism (Oberegger et al.,\u00a02001).", "Saprophytic fungi are dominant recyclers of natural organic substances specialized in breaking down recalcitrant plant material by their highly effective extracellular enzyme system.

Co\u2010regulation is achieved by cis\u2010acting elements targeted by pathway\u2010specific and broad\u2010domain transcription factors, as well as by chromatin level regulation which facilitates or inhibits access of these regulatory complexes to the target region (Brakhage,\u00a02013; Keller et al.,\u00a02005; Strauss & Reyes\u2010Dominguez,\u00a02011). One of the main conclusions drawn from the analyses of the ever\u2010increasing fungal genome databases is the discrepancy between known metabolites and the number of predicted BGCs. For each of the sequenced species, usually only a few SMs are known but many more BGCs are predicted in their genomes (Li et al.,\u00a02016). This is not only true for less\u2010studied species but even in aspergilli or penicillia only 20%\u201330% of the theoretically existing and predicted chemical diversity is known.

It is known since a long time, for example for pathogenic fungi like Fusarium graminearum, that a high proportion of predicted BGCs are only expressed during pathogenic growth (Boenisch & Sch\u00e4fer,\u00a02011; Desjardins et al.,\u00a01993). The corresponding transcriptional program responds to the encountered plant material (substrate response) and to the plant defence system (active plant response). Each of these conditions activates a different subset of SMs in F. graminearum (Boedi et al.,\u00a02016). There are numerous examples in which biotic interactions of a pathogenic, symbiotic or endophytic lifestyle alters the secondary metabolome of the fungal interaction partner. Also, free\u2010living interactions have been found to alter the SM profiles, for example in the mutual interaction between the soil inhabitants Aspergillus nidulans and Streptomyces rapamycinicus (Schroeckh et al.,\u00a02009). In this case, A. nidulans produces orsellinic acid (ORS) and yellow polyketides (YPKs), SMs that are barely found in axenic cultures under standard laboratory growth condition (Sanchez et al.,\u00a02010). The bacterial trigger ultimately leads to an activating chromatin landscape at the corresponding ORS/YPK BGC (N\u00fctzmann et al.,\u00a02011) and the formation of this open chromatin structure depends on the function of BasR, a fungal transcription factor induced by amino acid starvation (Fischer et al.,\u00a02018). Consistent with a chromatin\u2010level regulation of the ORS/YPK cluster the same activation can be observed in mutants lacking CclA or KdmB, central components of complexes which regulate the methylation status of histone H3 lysine 4 (Bok et al.,\u00a02009; Gacek\u2010Matthews et al.,\u00a02016).

Figure\u00a01(A) top shows an example of the experiment in which fungal inoculation points were fed with AMM and bacterial inoculation points with M79 media. Starting from these nutrient reservoirs at the opposite sides of the Petri dish the organisms were able to grow into the nutrient\u2010free agar. Using this setup, we observed that fungal mycelium spreading from the opposite side towards the bacterial colony was producing some YPs although there was no direct contact yet with the S. rapamycinicus colony [Figure\u00a01(A)]. No colour changes at the A. nidulans mycelia were observed in control experiments growing the fungal cells alone (data not shown). These observations indicated that YPKs and orsellinic acid may be produced by A. nidulans cells in response to the presence of S. rapamycinicus already before their physical contact takes place. To make sure there is no direct interaction via buried bacterial or fungal cell interactions we used a similar setup but containing S. rapamycinicus cells within a dialysis tube. The molecular weight cut off 8.000\u201310.000\u2009kDa allowed nutrients passing through the membrane at the point of inoculation but prevented bacterial cells to spread on or through the agar. We found also in this setup an induction of YPs [Figure\u00a01(B)]. We assume that the reduced induction in these experiments is likely caused by the dialysis tube barrier affecting free metabolite movements. To test if the signal for fungal pigment production requires actively growing bacterial cells or if a bacterial metabolite may be sufficient to induce YPs we subsequently applied sterile\u2010filtered culture supernatant from an S. rapamycinicus liquid culture grown in M79 media without A. nidulans. When adding these bacterial culture supernatants to an A. nidulans colony growing alone on the nutrient\u2010free agar we also observed YP production, although colouration was less intense [Figure\u00a01(C)]. Since in this latter approach S. rapamycinicus was grown \u2018solo\u2019 without A. nidulans, we could conclude that production of the YPs in A. nidulans is triggered by one or more compounds secreted by S. rapamycinicus cells growing in M79 medium and that the production of this inducer(s) does not depend on the presence of a competing or interacting organism. However, the presence of a competing organism like A. nidulans may cause elevated production of this unknown molecule(s).", "FIGURE 1(A) Top: Schematic setup; Aspergillus minimal medium (AMM) and M79 medium were placed into phosphate\u2010buffered water agar (green and blue circles, respectively).
