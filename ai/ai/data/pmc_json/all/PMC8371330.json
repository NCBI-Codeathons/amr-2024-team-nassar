In this study, a slow-growing Streptomyces strain expressing unique genomic and phenotypic characteristics, P38-E01T, was described using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. This strain is part of a collection of over 8,000 marine Actinobacteria isolates collected in the Trondheim fjord of Norway by SINTEF Industry (Trondheim, Norway) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU, Trondheim, Norway). Strain P38-E01T was isolated from the sediments of the Trondheim fjord, and phylogenetic analyses affiliated this strain with the genus Streptomyces, but it was not closely affiliated with other described species. The closest related type strains were Streptomyces daliensis YIM 31724T (98.6%), Streptomyces rimosus subsp. rimosus ATCC 10970T (98.4%), and Streptomyces sclerotialus NRRL ISP-5269T (98.3%). Predominant fatty acids were C16:0 iso, C16:0, and Summed Feature 3, and the predominant respiratory quinones were MK-10(H6), MK-10(H4), and MK9(H4). The main polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphoglycolipid. The whole-cell sugars were glucose, ribose, and in minor amounts, mannose. The cell wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid. The draft genome has a size of 6.16 Mb, with a %G + C content of 71.4% and is predicted to contain at least 19 biosynthetic gene clusters encoding diverse secondary metabolites. Strain P38-E01T was found to inhibit the growth of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and a number of Gram-positive bacterial human and plant pathogens. Metabolites extracted from cultures of P38-E01T were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and it was found that the isolate produced the antifungal compound candicidin. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic signatures, along with phylogenetic analyses, distinguished isolate P38-E01T from its closest neighbors; thus, this isolate represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces for which the name Streptomyces tardus sp. nov. (P38-E01T = CCM 9049T = DSM 111582T) is proposed.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The genus Streptomyces was first proposed in the early 1940s (Waksman and Henrici, 1943) and has since become a popular subject of bioprospecting studies in search for new bioactive natural products. To date, the genus Streptomyces comprises a tremendous number of well-described species with vigorous ability to produce secondary metabolites that possess antibacterial (Waksman et al., 1944; Brown et al., 1976; Ser et al., 2016), antifungal (Law et al., 2017b), antioxidant (Tan et al., 2015; Law et al., 2017a), or anticancer activities (Tan et al., 2015). The broad range of biological activities of microbial secondary metabolites is the reason why Streptomyces spp. are comprehensively explored for novel taxa in order to uncover new drugs useful for therapeutic or preventative treatments. Streptomycetes are Gram-positive filamentous bacteria with three developmental stages of their life cycle, forming vegetative hyphae, reproductive aerial hyphae, and finally spores (Urem et al., 2016). Due to the high number of species validly described within the genus Streptomyces (over 800 to date) (Parte, 2018), characterization of any potentially novel species can pose a significant taxonomic challenge. Therefore, a polyphasic taxonomic approach starting with thorough biochemical and morphological testing supported by analyses of chemotaxonomic profiles and high-throughput molecular methods represents an appropriate and reliable way to characterize novel species within this genus (Ayed et al., 2018).", "The genus Streptomyces was first proposed in the early 1940s (Waksman and Henrici, 1943) and has since become a popular subject of bioprospecting studies in search for new bioactive natural products.

However, soil Actinobacteria have historically dominated the focus of novel taxa exploration and bioactivity screenings (Matsumoto and Takahashi, 2017). Thus, a current trend of studying Actinobacteria is focused on the isolation of new species from different biotopes such as mangroves (Law et al., 2019), lichens (Saeng-in et al., 2018), plant roots (Matsumoto and Takahashi, 2017; Ayed et al., 2018), or marine subaquatic areas (Dharmaraj, 2010; Shaik et al., 2017). In particular, the marine biosphere represents a large source of microbial diversity, and within this habitat, Streptomyces spp. are known to play a significant ecological role in organic matter turnover because of their extensive metabolic processes (Shaik et al., 2017).

For Illumina short-read sequencing, a paired-end library was generated using genomic DNA of strain P38-E01T and approximately 300 bp of tagmentation using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer instructions of the manufacturer. A total of 2,157,583 2 \u00d7 125-bp paired-end sequence reads were generated using the Illumina HiSeq2500 system, yielding 516 Mb sequence data. FASTQ sequence files were generated using the Illumina Casava pipeline version 1.8.3. Initial quality assessment was based on data passing the Illumina Chastity filtering. Subsequently, reads containing PhiX control signal were removed by filtering. In addition, reads containing (partial) adapters were clipped (up to a minimum read length of 50 bp). Quality assessment was based on the remaining reads using the FASTQC quality control tool version 0.10.0. The average quality score (Phred) obtained was 38.27. The quality of the Illumina reads was improved further by trimming low-quality bases using BBDuk, which is a part of the BBMap suite version 36.77.1 High-quality reads were assembled into contigs using ABySS version 2.0 (Jackman et al., 2017), also incorporating paired-end read For the PacBio long-read sequencing; a total of 579,093 reads (mean read length 4,440 bases) were generated using the PacBio Sequel instrument, yielding 2,571 Mb of sequence data.
