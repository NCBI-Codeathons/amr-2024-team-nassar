["Cellulose is one of the most abundant and renewable biomass products used for the production of bioethanol. Cellulose can be efficiently hydrolyzed by Bacillus subtilis VS15, a strain isolate obtained from decomposing logs. A genome shuffling approach was implemented to improve the cellulase activity of Bacillus subtilis VS15. Mutant strains were created using ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS), N-Methyl-N\u2032 nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG), and ultraviolet light (UV) followed by recursive protoplast fusion. After two rounds of shuffling, the mutants Gb2, Gc8, and Gd7 were produced that had an increase in cellulase activity of 128%, 148%, and 167%, respectively, in comparison to the wild type VS15. The genetic diversity of the shuffled strain Gd7 and wild type VS15 was compared at whole genome level. Genomic-level comparisons identified a set of eight genes, consisting of cellulase and regulatory genes, of interest for further analyses. Various genes were identified with insertions and deletions that may be involved in improved celluase production in Gd7. Strain Gd7 maintained the capability of hydrolyzing wheatbran to glucose and converting glucose to ethanol by fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae of the wild type VS17. This ability was further confirmed by the acidified potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) method.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant bio-renewable, carbon-neutral resource. It is the basis for alternative energy platforms with the potential to decrease CO2 emissions and atmospheric pollution by reducing the usage of fossil fuels [1]. Due to the abundance and availability of lignocellulosic biomass, lignocellulosic-derived cellulosic ethanol represents a significant and inexpensive petroleum fuel alternative [2]. Lignocellulosic derived glucose is a potential feed stock for a wide variety of biologically produced chemicals and bio fuels [3]. Cellulase has been widely used in various industrial applications such as the food, animal feed, beer and wine, textile, laundry industry pulp, paper, agriculture, bio-fuel, and pharmaceutical industries amongst others [4].", "Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant bio-renewable, carbon-neutral resource.

Cellulose can be hydrolyzed by a group of enzymes referred to as cellulases, which themselves are classified within carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), including exoglucanase, endoglucanase, and \u03b2 glucosidase [5]. Endoglucanases, or Endo-1, 4-\u03b2-d-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4), act on amorphous sites. cleave randomly at internal glycoside bonds to generate both reducing and non-reducing ends of cellulose. Exoglucanase, or 1,4-\u03b2-d-cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.91), hydrolyzes the reducing or non-reducing ends of cellulose, liberating either cellobiose or glucose as the major products. \u03b2-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) is a key enzyme for complete hydrolyzing of cellobiose to liberate free glucose molecules [5].", "Lignocellulosic biomass comprises of three major components: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.

This can be achieved by multi-parental crossing though DNA shuffling with a homologous recombination of entire genomes, analogous to conventional breeding [8]. Through this process, microbial genome shuffling efficiently generates combinatorial libraries of new strains with diverse genetic potential. Hence, this approach is able to produce strains with improved characteristics and efficiencies in respect to desirable phenotypes. For example, genome shuffling improved the production of Tylosin by Streptomycin fradie, which has been estimated to reduce an approximately twenty year and a one million strain screen classical approach to just a year and 24,000 screens [9].", "Genome shuffling is an efficient tool to generate improved strains, whereby the genome of multiple parent strains is shuffled through recursive recombination.

Conclusions", "Genome shuffling was applied to bacterial strain in which the cellulase activity of Bacillus subtilis VS15 was enhanced by 167%. Bacillus subtilis VS15 and Gd7 show enzyme activity at extreme temperatures (50 \u00b0C), which is much more beneficial for industrial processes. The whole genomes of the wild and shuffled strain were obtained by NGS and compared. There were differences in the genome sequences that demonstrated the effect of genome shuffling. A set of genes were analyzed to infer the cause for enhanced cellulase production. It can be infered that the cause of enhanced cellulase production in the shuffled strain is due to the interaction of multiple mutations of multiple genes. Production of ethanol with the help of Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that the cellulase activity can be used in the production of biofuel from cellulosic residues. This is the first report comparing the genomes of wild and shuffled strains.", "Genome shuffling was applied to bacterial strain in which the cellulase activity of Bacillus subtilis VS15 was enhanced by 167%.
