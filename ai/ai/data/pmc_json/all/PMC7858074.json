["Pantoea ananatis is a significant plant pathogen that targets a number of important crops, a problem that is compounded by the absence of effective treatments to prevent its spread. Our identification of pantaphos as the key virulence factor in onion center rot suggests a variety of approaches that could be employed to address this significant plant disease.", "ABSTRACT", "Pantoea ananatis is the primary cause of onion center rot. Genetic data suggest that a phosphonic acid natural product is required for pathogenesis; however, the nature of the molecule is unknown. Here, we show that P. ananatis produces at least three phosphonates, two of which were purified and structurally characterized. The first, designated pantaphos, was shown to be 2-(hydroxy[phosphono]methyl)maleate; the second, a probable biosynthetic precursor, was shown to be 2-(phosphonomethyl)maleate. Purified pantaphos is both necessary and sufficient for the hallmark lesions of onion center rot. Moreover, when tested against mustard seedlings, the phytotoxic activity of pantaphos was comparable to the widely used herbicides glyphosate and phosphinothricin. Pantaphos was also active against a variety of human cell lines but was significantly more toxic to glioblastoma cells. Pantaphos showed little activity when tested against a variety of bacteria and fungi.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Pantoea species have been recognized as plant pathogens since 1928 (1). These Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae were originally classified as members of the genus Erwinia but were subsequently moved to Pantoea based on DNA hybridization experiments (2). Although many Pantoea species are benign or beneficial plant mutualists, strains of P. ananatis are consistently associated with harmful crop and forest infestations (3\u20137). Since 1983, the known hosts of P. ananatis have increased to 8 plant species in 11 countries, including important crops such as rice, corn, onions, melon, and pineapple (8). Upon plant infection, these bacteria cause internal rotting, dieback, and blight, resulting in severe economic losses. In addition to primary infection in the field, significant postharvest losses, as observed in onion center rot, have also been reported (9). Moreover, this plant pathogen can also infect humans and insects, which serve as vectors for plant infection (10\u201312). Thus, there is a compelling need to understand P. ananatis pathogenesis to help address its epidemic spread among essential food crops.", "Pantoea species have been recognized as plant pathogens since 1928 (1).

Comparative genomic analyses revealed substantial diversity between P. ananatis strains, which may account for their ability to colonize and thrive in so many different hosts (13, 14). The pathogenicity determinants encoded by diverse P. ananatis genomes include quorum sensing systems, type VI secretion systems, motility factors, cell wall-degrading enzymes, and thiosulfinate resistance alleles (15\u201317). In 2019, a novel pathogenicity determinant for onion center rot was revealed by comparison of the genomic sequences of two pathogenic and two nonpathogenic P. ananatis strains (18). This approach identified a genomic island designated \u201cHiVir,\u201d which was subsequently shown to be present in 14 pathogenic strains and absent in 16 nonpathogenic strains using a PCR-based screen. The HiVir locus encodes an 11-gene operon (here, designated hvr) that was suggested to encode a biosynthetic pathway for an unknown phosphonic acid natural product based on the presence of a putative pepM gene. This gene encodes the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) phosphonomutase, which catalyzes the first step in all characterized phosphonate biosynthetic pathways and which has been extensively used as a genetic marker for the ability to produce phosphonic acid metabolites (19, 20). Deletion of pepM in P. ananatis OC5a resulted in a strain with severely attenuated pathogenicity in Allium cepa (onion), demonstrating a required role for the hvr operon in onion center rot.

The bioactivity of these molecules results from their structural similarity to phosphate esters and carboxylic acids, which allows them to bind enzymes that act on analogous substrates, thus inhibiting enzyme activity. A prominent example is the manmade herbicide glyphosate, which was first synthesized by chemists in the 1950s. The phytotoxicity of glyphosate is due to its inhibition of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants (21). Significantly, enzyme inhibition by individual phosphonates is quite specific and typically confined to enzymes that act on chemically homologous substrates. Accordingly, a phosphonate can be toxic to one group of organisms while remaining innocuous to another. Thus, depending on the organism in which the target enzyme is found, phosphonates find applications as specific antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasital, and herbicidal compounds (22\u201324). Given the ubiquitous occurrence of phosphate esters and carboxylic acids in metabolism, the range of potential biological targets for phosphonate inhibitors is vast. Indeed, as demonstrated by the number of organisms known to produce bioactive phosphonates, nature has often capitalized on this metabolic Achilles\u2019 heel. Examples include phosphinothricin tripeptide and fosmidomycin, produced by members of the genus Streptomyces, which have potent herbicidal and antimicrobial activity due to their inhibition of the essential enzymes glutamate synthase and deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, respectively (25\u201327). Nature also makes use of the fact that the C-P bond is highly stable and resistant to both chemical and enzymatic degradation.

In P. ananatis, this reaction would be catalyzed by the HvrA protein, which is highly homologous to known PEP mutases. Because the PEP mutase reaction is highly endergonic (\u0394G \u223c125\u2009kJ/mol), subsequent steps must be highly favorable to drive net phosphonate synthesis (40). In the proposed pathway, this thermodynamic driving force is provided by the exergonic condensation of acetyl-CoA and phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) catalyzed by the HvrC protein, which is a homolog of the biochemically characterized phosphonomethylmalate (PMM) synthase involved in FR-900098 biosynthesis (41). PMM would then be dehydrated to form 2-phosphonomethylmaleate by HvrD and HvrE.

We felt it was worth revisiting this analysis in the light of the structures identified above. A total of 33 related gene clusters were identified in the NCBI genomic sequence databases using a combination of bioinformatics approaches. Based on the arrangement and the presence or absence of orthologous genes, nine types of Hvr-like biosynthetic gene clusters were observed (Fig.\u00a0S6) Putative orthologs of HvrA-F are conserved in all of these groups, with the exception of type VIII, which replaces the HvrDE proteins with a putative aconitase. As shown in Fig.\u00a06, aconitase catalyzes a reaction that is essentially identical to the putative HvrDE reaction. Thus, we predict that the biosynthetic pathway encoded by the type VIII hvr-like gene cluster has identical intermediates produced by paralogous enzymes. A feature that differentiates the nine types of hvr-like clusters is the presence or absence of one or more ATP-Grasp proteins, suggesting that a variety of peptidic derivatives of pantaphos might be produced in nature. However, type IX, which lacks ATP-Grasp family proteins, likely has very different structural modifications compared to the other types, based on the presence of homologs to several additional enzyme families. Finally, the clusters also differ with respect to their putative export proteins and the presence/absence of a putative flavin reductase. The latter is not unexpected, as many flavin-dependent enzymes can utilize generic reductases encoded by unlinked genes (51, 52).

For example, phosphinothricin tripeptide is a potent antibacterial compound, while unmodified phosphinothricin has poor activity (57).

Sample A was acidified using concentrated acetic acid to pH 3 and incubated with the Fe-IMAC resin at 4\u00b0C for 2\u2009h. The solution was separated from the resin using a gravity column, and the flowthrough containing unbound phosphonic acids was saved (sample-flowthrough).
