However, the detailed structure-binding mechanism of the interactions between CPTs and the insect Top1 protein remains unclear, which significantly hinders the development of novel CPTs as new insecticides. Herein, a series of 7-amide camptothecin analogs based on the binding mode of camptothecin in complex with Top1 (Sf Top1)-DNA from Spodoptera frugiperda cultured cell line Sf9 were designed and synthesized. Fifteen of these compounds exhibited excellent cytotoxic activity (values of IC50 from 2.01 to 6.78 \u03bcM) compared with camptothecin (29.47 \u03bcM). The molecular simulations revealed the binding mechanism when the camptothecin parent rings were inserting parallel to DNA bases and stabling the ternary complex by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacked and hydrogen-bond interactions, and further suggested that introduction of lipophilic and some electron-withdrawing groups on the amide linkage of camptothecin could be beneficial to its activity via some non-covalent interactions. Furthermore, almost all the synthesized compounds could inhibit the growth of Spodoptera litura larvae strongly (Inhibition rate from 50.20 to 79.05%), superior or comparable to camptothecin (55.69%) after 8 days of exposure. In particular, the compounds 4c, 4d, 4f, and 4j, which presented more than 70% inhibitory activities, were deserved to be developed as potential biorational pesticides. The information described here would be useful for the further design and development of potentially effective pesticides in the field of plant protection.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "In recent years, much interest has focused on the development of biorational pesticides with good insecticidal activity and environmental safety. Many active compounds derived from plants, such as azadirachtin, rotenone and nicotine, not only possess superior activity and environmental safety, but also provide lead compounds for biorational pesticides innovation (Petroski and Stanley, 2009; Cantrell et al., 2012). Camptothecin, a natural quinolone alkaloid product, was extracted from the bark of the Chinese tree Camptotheca acuminata by Wall et al. in the early 1960s (Wall and Wani, 1966). During the 1980s, topoisomerase 1 (Top1) has been identified as the target protein of camptothecin (Hsiang et al., 1985). Top1 is involved in the process of cell growth and proliferation, and is needed for DNA replication and transcription (Staker et al., 2002). Its mode of action is to break one of DNA supercoiling double-strands by covalent binding, then making a recombination with the other strand revolving around (Pommier et al., 1998; Redinbo et al., 1998). As an inhibitor, camptothecin could prevent DNA re-ligation by forming a stabilizing ternary composite with Top 1-DNA (Staker et al., 2002). Due to the special mechanism, CPTs present potent anti-tumor or insecticidal activities, and some of them have been commonly used in clinical trials (Broom, 1996; Chabot, 1997). Meanwhile, camptothecin was also used as a potent chemosterilant against the house fly for decades (DeMilo and Borkovec, 1974; Borkovec, 1976). In recent years, various CPTs have been synthesized and exhibited efficient toxicity to Spodoptera exigua, Nilaparvata lugens, Brevicoryne brassicae, Chilo suppressalis, Tetranychus cinnabarinus, Bursaphelenchus xylophilu, and so on (Ma et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). It has been evaluated that 7-substituted analogs demonstrated quite good insecticidal activity (Liu et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2015). Moreover, camptothecin and its mixtures with other effective ingredients exhibited good insecticidal or synergistic activity when were evaluated in the laboratory and field against various insect pests (Sun et al., 2012; Tong and Feng, 2016a,b). Previous works conducted in our lab suggested that camptothecin could induce apoptosis in Spodoptera frugiperda cultured cell line Sf9, and inhibits the Top1 of insect cells by decreasing the ability to relax the negatively supercoiled plasmid pBR322 DNA (Wang et al., 2011; Gong et al., 2014). Similarly, some studies have also shown an identical outcome, which further revealed the key residues involved in the relaxation activity and the apoptosis mechanism related to the mitochondrial pathway (Zhang et al., 2012, 2013, 2017; Ren et al., 2017).", "In recent years, much interest has focused on the development of biorational pesticides with good insecticidal activity and environmental safety.

Although the crystal structure of human Top1 in complex with the poison topotecan and a covalent complex with DNA duplexes was established in 2002 (Staker et al., 2002), few of researchers has addressed the importance of using this structure to develop new compounds applicable for pest management. Here we cloned the Top1 (Sf Top1) gene from Sf9 cells, built the 3D model for Sf Top1 by homologous modeling, and then illuminated its binding mode with CPTs. We designed and synthesized quite a number of target derivatives based on the binding mode, and assessed the activities in vitro. Furthermore, molecular docking and dynamical simulations studies were applied to clarify the interaction mechanism between CPTs and Sf Top1-DNA complex.

Although camptothecin has been shown to be a specific active substance for topoisomerase 1 in human and some insect cells, but its derivative still have the possibility of being defined as PAINS for effects on the insect. In our work, we demonstrated that these derivatives significantly inhibited the activity of the sf Top1 protein as much as camptothecin in vitro, indicating the specific activity of the synthesized compounds on the insect. In fact, from the results of molecular dynamics simulations, we revealed the mechanism by which CPT derivatives act primarily by maintaining the stability of the complex through its six-membered ring, whereas the side chain groups can interact with protein/nucleic acids and further appropriately enhanced the stability.

In the binding model of camptothecin with HsTop 1, the rigid backbone structure of camptothecin forms a strong hydrophobic interaction with the base. In addition, the hydrogen bond interaction between Top1 and camptothecin provides an essential contribution to stabilizing the top-DNA complex, which is crucial for maintaining the activity (Staker et al., 2002). Among the camptothecin derivatives we designed, some compounds, such as 4j and 4m could form strong hydrogen bonds with the insect Top1. Interestingly, the amino acid residues Asn352 and Lys436 in HsTop1, which are equivalent to Asn518 and Lys602 residues in sf Top1, may also form H-bond interactions with camptothecin derivatives to stabilize the ternary complex (Song et al., 2016). In different organisms, these two amino acid residues behave very conservatively, and they are located in the active pocket of the protein. In our study, the docking studies revealed the direct interactions between the residues Asn518 and Lys602 in the insect protein with some camptothecin derivatives we designed, and also illustrated these two residues may play critical roles in the binding of the ligand. However, in the results of the molecular dynamics simulation, the side chain of the derivative has a large volatility in the binding lumen, which is different from the docking results. The protein is inflexible during molecular docking study, and the initial structure of the protein has a large impact on the final binding model. CDOCKER molecular docking program based on the CHARMm force field can quickly predict the possible binding model of protein-ligand, but the inflexibility of protein and nucleic acid may compromise the accuracy of the results. In addition, the original CHARMm force field is not optimal for DNA during molecular docking simulation although it is particularly useful when mimicking proteins (Hart et al., 2012). In contrast, molecular dynamics simulation is better to predict the binding modes without the deficiency presenting in the docking simulations, and to verify whether proposed ligand remain in interactions with the listed residues. In fact, the binding model obtained by molecular dynamics simulation is similar to the molecular docking result, in which the compound interacts with the listed residues (Arg530, Asp698, and Lys697) and the bases via hydrogen bonding and combines with the nucleic acid by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. Overall, molecular docking simulation is still a good method to quickly predict the mainly protein-ligand binding, albeit with some deficiencies. However, molecular dynamics simulations can better explain the binding mechanism of protein-ligands in which amino acid residues in the binding lumen and ligand groups with greater flexibility. The revealed interaction mechanism by these simulations might be useful for further structural modifications and could provide valuable direction for exploring new potent compounds.", "To elucidate the specific mechanism of camptothecin derivatives, we performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.

In general, camptothecin is able to enter the cells easily and interact with Top1, and then cause apoptosis and hinder cell growth (Zhong et al., 2016). Different from the traditional neurotoxic insecticides, CPTs generally exhibit a delayed insecticidal activity (Liu et al., 2010). In addition to inducing apoptosis in insect cells, camptothecin can also induce the midgut epithelial cells apoptosis in S. litura larva (Gong et al., 2014). However, insects have a complete detoxification system, including many detoxification enzymes, therefore, they may decompose the exogenous compounds and reduce their toxicity, which might lead to the different toxicity results obtained in vitro and in vivo, but the detailed mechanism that the relationship between activity in vitro and effectiveness in vivo remains unclear and needs to be explored further. Nevertheless, in our study, some compounds, such as 4c, 4d, 4f, and 4j, still show more significant activities than camptothecin both in vitro and in vivo, and are still hopeful to continue further research as the potential pesticides. In view of this, considering the safety of using these compounds on agricultural products that would be consumed by humans, the toxicological assessments of camptothecin derivatives for environment and organisms might be performed in the future. In the early report, 0.2% camptothecin emulsifiable concentrate (EC) showed strong toxicity for control of agricultural pests and no acute oral toxicity to the mouse (LD50 > 5000 mg/kg) nor acute dermal toxicity (LD50 > 2000 mg/kg) (Ma et al., 2010), which means that the camptothecin pesticide might have a safe dosage to mammals. A high dosage of oral or injectable camptothecin drugs easily caused side effects to humans in treatment of solid tumors. In general, the final residual pesticides degraded by microorganisms in the agricultural field are often safety to mammals. However, the oral acute and sub-acute toxicity of camptothecin derivatives remains to be further evaluated, and it is also necessary to explore the highest safety dosage of the drugs for humans (Manikandan and Kannan, 2015). In addition, the residue of camptothecin derivatives need to be tested by the field experiment in order to monitor the degradation dynamics of this kind of pesticide. After a period of safety interval, the residue of camptothecin pesticide could reach to a lower level which is safe for human beings. Moreover, considering the toxicity of this kind of pesticide for non-target organisms, especially whether they could cause lethal effect or infertility on mammals when applying in the field, more assessments should be taken into account. At the same time, these potential side effects could be alleviated by continually optimizing the structure. Overall, such compounds have the special mechanism on the insect and might have a good prospect for further development.", "Although most of the designed compounds exhibited more pronounced activity (about 10-fold) in vitro than camptothecin, the activity in vivo did not wholly follow the law in vitro, and most of the compounds showed only equivalence to camptothecin.

The binding mode of camptothecin with Sf Top1-DNA complex was proposed. Besides, a total of seventeen novel 7-amide camptothecin derivatives were designed based on the mode of the Sf Top1-DNA-camptothecin complex via a rational analysis, and systematically synthesized. Almost all of the synthesized compounds were found to be more antiproliferative as compared with CPT. The molecular simulations revealed that the amide linkage of derivatives is likely to be formed by H-bond interaction with the DNA bases, and the introduction of some electronegative groups also has the potential to stabilize the ternary complexes via beneficial non-covalent interactions. Furthermore, the designed compounds, especially 4c, 4d, 4f, and 4j, which could strongly inhibit the growth of the S. litura larva are expected to be developed as potential biorational pesticides. All these results demonstrated the interaction mechanism between camptothecin and its derivatives with Sf Top1, and presented a structural model of Sf Top1-DNA that is useful for further structural modification and exploration of potential compounds.", "The coding sequence of Sf Top1 was obtained, and the three-dimensional structure model was built according to the known information.
