["ABSTRACT", "Secondary metabolites are synthesized by many microorganisms and provide a fitness benefit in the presence of competitors and predators. Secondary metabolism also can be costly, as it shunts energy and intermediates from primary metabolism. In Pseudomonas spp., secondary metabolism is controlled by the GacS-GacA global regulatory system. Intriguingly, spontaneous mutations in gacS or gacA (Gac\u2212 mutants) are commonly observed in laboratory cultures. Here we investigated the role of secondary metabolism in the accumulation of Gac\u2212 mutants in Pseudomonas\u00a0protegens strain Pf-5. Our results showed that secondary metabolism, specifically biosynthesis of the antimicrobial compound pyoluteorin, contributes significantly to the accumulation of Gac\u2212 mutants. Pyoluteorin biosynthesis, which poses a metabolic burden on the producer cells, but not pyoluteorin itself, leads to the accumulation of the spontaneous mutants. Interspecific competition also influenced the accumulation of the Gac\u2212 mutants: a reduced proportion of Gac\u2212 mutants accumulated when P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 was cocultured with Bacillus subtilis than in pure cultures of strain Pf-5. Overall, our study associated a fitness trade-off with secondary metabolism, with metabolic costs versus competitive benefits of production influencing the evolution of P.\u00a0protegens, assessed by the accumulation of Gac\u2212 mutants.", "IMPORTANCE", "Many microorganisms produce antibiotics, which contribute to ecologic fitness in natural environments where microbes constantly compete for resources with other organisms. However, biosynthesis of antibiotics is costly due to the metabolic burdens of the antibiotic-producing microorganism. Our results provide an example of the fitness trade-off associated with antibiotic production. Under noncompetitive conditions, antibiotic biosynthesis led to accumulation of spontaneous mutants lacking a master regulator of antibiotic production. However, relatively few of these spontaneous mutants accumulated when a competitor was present. Results from this work provide information on the evolution of antibiotic biosynthesis and provide a framework for their discovery and regulation.", "KEYWORDS", "INTRODUCTION", "INTRODUCTION", "Secondary metabolites play important roles in physiological adaptation and ecologic fitness of the organisms producing secondary metabolites (1, 2). These metabolites vary widely in structure and biological activity, with some having valuable pharmaceutical and agricultural applications (3, 4). Diverse classes of secondary metabolites are produced by plants, animals, and microorganisms, but knowledge of the natural functions of secondary metabolites is still limited. Secondary metabolites are thought to represent important adaptive characters of the organisms producing secondary metabolites in their native environments (2, 5). For example, a secondary metabolite with antimicrobial activity may allow organisms to inhibit competitors that occupy the same niches (6). On the other hand, secondary metabolism poses metabolic burdens to the producer by diverting precursors, cofactors, and energy from primary metabolism (7). Consequently, unnecessary expression of secondary metabolites can be costly to organisms producing secondary metabolites. To balance the benefits and costs, secondary metabolism is controlled by complex regulatory networks that regulate production in response to environmental factors and physiological status of the organism producing secondary metabolites (8, 9). These networks involve both global and pathway-specific regulators operating to coordinate secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (10\u201312).", "Secondary metabolites play important roles in physiological adaptation and ecologic fitness of the organisms producing secondary metabolites (1, 2).

Secondary metabolism in Pseudomonas spp. requires the GacS-GacA two-component regulatory system, composed of the sensor kinase GacS and the cognate cellular response regulator GacA (14). In the presence of an unknown signal(s), the sensor kinase GacS autophosphorylates and transfers a phosphate group to the response regulator GacA, which governs a complex signal transduction pathway involving regulatory RNAs and translational repression (14). The GacS-GacA system controls the expression of hundreds of genes, including those required for the production of secondary metabolites and extracellular enzymes (15\u201319). Accordingly, mutation of gacA and/or gacS has pleiotropic effects on the bacterial cell, influencing motility, iron acquisition, biofilm formation, aspects of primary metabolism, and many other phenotypes (15, 16, 20). Given the broad influence of the GacS-GacA system on bacterial physiology, it is striking that spontaneous gacS and gacA mutants (i.e., Gac\u2212 mutants) emerge and accumulate in cultures of Pseudomonas spp. (17, 21\u201327). Colonies of these mutants can be distinguished from those of the wild type visually by their expanded colony size, flattened appearance, increased fluorescence under UV light, and lack of extracellular protease production (21, 24).", "The production of a large spectrum of secondary metabolites is a characteristic of bacteria in the genus Pseudomonas (13).

After 6\u00a0days of growth, the proportion of Gac\u2212 mutants was significantly lower in cultures of this 6-fold mutant relative to wild-type Pf-5 (Fig.\u00a03A), which supports our hypothesis that secondary metabolism plays a role in the accumulation of spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants in strain Pf-5.", "FIG\u00a03\u00a0Accumulation of spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 and its secondary metabolism knockout mutants.

These results suggest that the process of pyoluteorin production, instead of the pyoluteorin compound, contributes to the accumulation of spontaneous Gac\u2212 mutants.

For example, we evaluated the possibility that the Gac\u2212 mutants and wild-type Pf-5 differ in sensitivity to pyoluteorin, which could impose a selective pressure on the relative abundance of the two genotypes; however, no detectable difference was observed in pyoluteorin sensitivities of Gac\u2212 mutants versus wild-type Pf-5 (Fig.\u00a0S3). It is also possible that intermediates accumulated during pyoluteorin biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a0S4) could influence the relative fitness of Gac\u2212 mutants versus wild-type cells in culture. Pyoluteorin is composed of a pyrrole moiety, which is synthesized via a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), and a resorcinol ring synthesized by a polyketide synthase (PKS). Of the eight enzymes (PltLABCDEFG [Fig.\u00a0S4A]) required for the biosynthesis of pyoluteorin (30), two (PltE and PltF [Fig.\u00a0S4B]) synthesize the pyrrolyl-2-thioester on the peptidyl carrier protein PltL (43). Two chlorines are added to the pyrrolyl substrate on the carrier protein scaffold by the FADH2-dependent halogenase PltA (44). The dichloropyrrolyl-S-PltL is the likely substrate for the PKS steps catalyzed by PltB and PltC, in which malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) monomers are added to an elongating carbon chain, released from the PKS by the thioesterase PltG, and cyclized to form the resorcinol ring (30). The mutation of pltA used in this study is not expected to interfere with the expression of downstream genes because a promoter is predicted upstream of pltB (45). The PltA substrate is pyrrolyl-S-PltL (Fig.\u00a0S4B), which is tethered to the peptidyl carrier protein so is unlikely to accumulate in the cytosol of the \u0394pltA mutant (44). Therefore, it is unlikely that the pltA mutation causes an increased concentration of an intermediate that influences the accumulation of Gac\u2212 mutants in cultures of Pf-5. In wild-type Pf-5, the dichlorinated pyrrole is proposed to be transferred from PltL to the acyl carrier protein domains in the polyketide synthases PltB and PltC. The dichlorinated pyrrole, which is present in wild-type Pf-5 and absent in the \u0394pltA mutant, is not thought to be released into the cytosol (44), so it is unlikely to influence the proportion of Gac\u2212 mutants in cultures of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5. On the basis of the current model for pyoluteorin biosynthesis, it seems unlikely that a pathway intermediate is responsible for the accumulation of Gac\u2212 mutants in cultures of strain Pf-5, but the model has not yet been fully evaluated in vivo. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that an intermediate(s) in pyoluteorin biosynthesis, which is not present in the \u0394pltA mutant, contributes to the differential fitness of Gac\u2212 mutants and wild-type Pf-5 in NYB cultures.

Given the known role of GacS-GacA in controlling diverse cellular traits, including motility, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism (15, 16, 20), spontaneous mutation of gacS or gacA provides a mechanism to regulate bacterial adaption at both cellular and population levels.", "In this study, medium composition (NYB versus NBG) and competition with B.\u00a0subtilis influenced the predominance of Gac\u2212 mutants in culture in a manner that supports the role of secondary metabolism as a primary phenotype influencing bacterial fitness. We recognize, however, that the influence of the GacS-GacA system reaches beyond secondary metabolism, controlling the expression of approximately 10% of the genes in the genome of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 (15). Accordingly, different GacS-GacA-regulated phenotypes are likely to influence the relative fitness of Gac\u2212 mutants versus wild type in different conditions. For example, the motility of strain Pf-5 is influenced by the GacS-GacA system (16), and the predominance of Gac\u2212 mutants at the advancing edge of swarming colonies of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 has been attributed to their hyperflagellation (17). Biofilm formation is also influenced by the GacS-GacA system (16), and Driscoll et al.

Duffy and D\u00e9fago (24) proposed that the osmotic potential of the medium influenced the proportion of Gac\u2212 mutants in cultures of P.\u00a0protegens CHA0, recognizing that GacS-GacA influences the response of bacterial cells to environmental stress (20, 27). Secondary metabolism influenced the proportion of Gac\u2212 mutants in cultures of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 in this study, but other GacS-GacA-controlled phenotypes are likely to mediate the proportion of Gac\u2212 mutant versus wild-type cells in other Pseudomonas species and in other environments.", "In this study, medium composition (NYB versus NBG) and competition with B.\u00a0subtilis influenced the predominance of Gac\u2212 mutants in culture in a manner that supports the role of secondary metabolism as a primary phenotype influencing bacterial fitness.

It contributes to ecologic fitness of the producers (1, 2) but can be metabolically costly (7). Secondary metabolism in Pseudomonas spp. is controlled by intricate regulatory circuits that include pathway-specific and global regulators that respond to environmental cues and physiological status. For example, in addition to the positive regulation imposed by GacS-GacA (54) and the pathway-specific regulator PltR (30), synthesis of pyoluteorin is also kept in check by numerous negative regulators that operate at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Specifically, pyoluteorin production by P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 and other strains of Pseudomonas is moderated by the presence of nonpreferred codons in PltR (11), transcriptional repressor PltZ (55), RNA-binding protein RsmE (45), stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS (29), Lon protease (56), and phloroglucinol, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (36, 46). The presence of multiple layers of negative regulation suggests that controlling pyoluteorin production to moderate levels is important for the fitness of the bacterial cell.

Three-microliter portions of the washed wild-type Pf-5 or \u0394gacA, \u0394pltA, or pltR* mutant cell suspensions were spotted onto the solidified plates. The plates were incubated at 27\u00b0C and imaged at 4 dpi. To test the inhibitory effect of P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5 and its derivatives on the growth of B.\u00a0subtilis 168 in liquid cultures, washed cells of B.\u00a0subtilis 168 were inoculated alone or coinoculated (1:1) with strain Pf-5 (wild type or \u0394gacA mutant) in NYB to an OD600 at 0.01. The bacterial cells were sampled at 6 dpi and diluted on NYA plates. The plates were incubated at 40\u00b0C which allows only the growth of B.\u00a0subtilis 168 but not P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5. The colonies were counted after 2-day incubation. At least three biological replicates were used in these experiments.", "Citation Yan Q, Lopes LD, Shaffer BT, Kidarsa TA, Vining O, Philmus B, Song C, Stockwell VO, Raaijmakers JM, McPhail KL, Andreote FD, Chang JH, Loper JE. 2018.
