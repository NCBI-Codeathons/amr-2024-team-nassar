["Abstract", "Durable crop protection is an essential component of current and future food security. However, the effectiveness of pesticides is threatened by the evolution of resistant pathogens, weeds and insect pests. Pesticides are mostly novel synthetic compounds, and yet target species are often able to evolve resistance soon after a new compound is introduced. Therefore, pesticide resistance provides an interesting case of rapid evolution under strong selective pressures, which can be used to address fundamental questions concerning the evolutionary origins of adaptations to novel conditions. We ask: (i) whether this adaptive potential originates mainly from de novo mutations or from standing variation; (ii) which pre\u2010existing traits could form the basis of resistance adaptations; and (iii) whether recurrence of resistance mechanisms among species results from interbreeding and horizontal gene transfer or from independent parallel evolution. We compare and contrast the three major pesticide groups: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Whilst resistance to these three agrochemical classes is to some extent united by the common evolutionary forces at play, there are also important differences. Fungicide resistance appears to evolve, in most cases, by de novo point mutations in the target\u2010site encoding genes; herbicide resistance often evolves through selection of polygenic metabolic resistance from standing variation; and insecticide resistance evolves through a combination of standing variation and de novo mutations in the target site or major metabolic resistance genes. This has practical implications for resistance risk assessment and management, and lessons learnt from pesticide resistance should be applied in the deployment of novel, non\u2010chemical pest\u2010control methods.", "INTRODUCTION: EVOLUTION OF PESTICIDE RESISTANCE", "INTRODUCTION: EVOLUTION OF PESTICIDE RESISTANCE", "As the world anticipates feeding nine billion people as sustainably as possible by 2050, crop protection against pest insects, diseases and weeds has a vital role in maintaining and improving crop yields (Godfray et al.,\n2010).

Work on the sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina, provides an example of both origins in resistance to OPs (Hartley et al.,\n2006; Rose et al.,\n2011). Resistance to the OP insecticides diazinon and malathion in this species is conferred by two independent mutations in esterase E3 encoded by the Lc\u03b17 gene. The G137N substitution confers resistance to diazinon while alterations at a second site, W251L/S/T, confers resistance to malathion. Analysis of Lc\u03b17 in Australasian strains of L. cuprina, including pinned specimens collected prior to the introduction of OP insecticides, has suggested that two incomplete soft sweeps occurred at this locus. Several resistance mutations at position 251 were observed in pinned specimens, providing unambiguous evidence of genetic variation existing before the first use of OPs. Conversely, the G137N mutation was only identified in post\u2010OP samples, suggesting that diazinon resistance may have evolved later by de novo mutation. The different origins for two resistance mutations in the same gene is intriguing and is likely related to their relative fitness cost, with mutation of position 137 carrying a much greater fitness penalty than substitutions at 251 (Hartley et al.,\n2006). Indeed, the G137N substitution may only have risen to high frequency because it confers much greater resistance to the more widely used diazinon insecticide and because of the proliferation of a compensatory mutation at a separate Modifier locus (Hartley et al.,\n2006).", "Evolution of insecticide resistance from standing genetic variation and by de novo mutation are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

Work on the sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina, provides an example of both origins in resistance to OPs (Hartley et al.,\n2006; Rose et al.,\n2011). Resistance to the OP insecticides diazinon and malathion in this species is conferred by two independent mutations in esterase E3 encoded by the Lc\u03b17 gene. The G137N substitution confers resistance to diazinon while alterations at a second site, W251L/S/T, confers resistance to malathion. Analysis of Lc\u03b17 in Australasian strains of L. cuprina, including pinned specimens collected prior to the introduction of OP insecticides, has suggested that two incomplete soft sweeps occurred at this locus.

Plants may have more relevant standing variation, especially for metabolic resistance, due to a wider pre\u2010existing metabolic range. This is often explained on the grounds that plants are non\u2010motile, and therefore must rely on detoxification rather than avoidance. However, fungal pathogens, with the lowest propensity to evolve pesticide resistance from standing variation in metabolic detoxification, are also sessile; and whilst insects are capable of chemotaxis and host choice, they have evolved metabolic adaptations to defence compounds produced by their own host plant. Fungal pathogens cannot move to find a suitable host, instead relying on the production of large numbers of spores so that some will land on the right plant. Therefore, the contrast between plant weeds and fungal pathogens is due not to differences in mobility, but perhaps to the types of eco\u2010evolutionary differences sometimes simplified to r/K selection (Reznick, Bryant & Bashey, 2002) or competitor\u2013stress tolerator\u2013ruderal (CSR) strategies (Grime, 1988). Whilst weed and pest species tend to be r\u2010strategists compared to other species within their taxa, comparisons among taxa would suggest that micro\u2010organisms are more extreme r\u2010strategists than macro\u2010flora. Therefore, plants may have evolved a higher degree of phenotypic plasticity so that an individual can cope in a range of surroundings, while pathogens rely more on the extreme over\u2010production of propagules for dispersal so that some will fall in favourable conditions \u2013 a strategy which may also favour higher rates of de novo mutation.
