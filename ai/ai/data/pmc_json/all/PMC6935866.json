["", "Assembly-line polyketide synthases (PKSs) are among the\nmost complex\nprotein machineries known in nature, responsible for the biosynthesis\nof numerous compounds used in the clinic. Their present-day diversity\nis the result of an evolutionary path that has involved the emergence\nof a multimodular architecture and further diversification of assembly-line\nPKSs. In this review, we provide an overview of previous studies that\ninvestigated PKS evolution and propose a model that challenges the\ncurrently prevailing view that gene duplication has played a major\nrole in the emergence of multimodularity. We also analyze the ensemble\nof orphan PKS clusters sequenced so far to evaluate how large the\nentire diversity of assembly-line PKS clusters and their chemical\nproducts could be. Finally, we examine the existing techniques to\naccess the natural PKS diversity in natural and heterologous hosts\nand describe approaches to further expand this diversity through engineering.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Polyketide Synthases (PKSs)", "Polyketide Synthases (PKSs)", "Polyketide Synthases (PKSs)", "Polyketide\nsynthases (PKSs) are multifunctional enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis\nof numerous natural products, many of which are currently used as\nantibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), antiparasitic drugs (e.g., avermectin),\ncholesterol-lowering agents (e.g., lovastatin), immunosuppressants\n(e.g., FK506), and cancer chemotherapy (e.g., epothilone).

Even though trans-AT PKS\nmodules lack an AT domain, they usually contain a region called ATd,\na subdomain nested between the KS and downstream domains.69 It is structurally similar to the rigid KS-AT\nlinker of cis-AT PKSs, a region that plays an important\nrole in ACP docking during chain elongation and translocation.70 The ATd subdomains of trans-AT PKSs often contain two additional helices, which have been proposed\nto facilitate lateral interactions between PKSs.71 However, in some cases ATd subdomains also include a large\nfragment of the AT domain or even entire KS-AT didomains.72 These KS-AT regions of various lengths may represent\nevolutionary intermediates between bacterial cis-AT\nand trans-AT PKSs. The evolution of trans-AT PKSs through AT domain loss would explain the absence of iterative trans-AT PKSs, which should have existed if the evolution\nof the two PKS groups was independent, from two respective groups\nof iterative PKS. Intriguingly, iterative cis-AT\nPKSs exist not only as stand-alone enzymes but are sometimes present\nas \u201cstuttering\u201d modules within an assembly-line PKS\n(reviewed in refs (1,73)). For example,\nthe stigmatellin,74 borrelidin,75 aureothin,76 and\nneoaureothin48 synthases each harbor a\nmodule that performs more than one round of programmed chain elongation.77,78 In other cases, module iterations are stochastic, leading to minor\nbyproducts. For example, certain modules of DEBS and the epothilone\nsynthase have been shown to iterate at measurable frequencies.79,80 Although mechanisms have evolved to preclude back-transfer of polyketides\nin assembly-line PKSs (such as the \u201cratchet\u201d81), these remnants of iterative functions could\nreflect the evolutionary origins of assembly-line PKSs.", "If cis-AT PKSs originated through module duplication, then\nit is also unclear why only the phylogeny of KS domains supports this\nmodel.
