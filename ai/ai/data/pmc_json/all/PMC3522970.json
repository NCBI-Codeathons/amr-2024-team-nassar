["In this study honeycomb-like NiO nanostructures were grown on nickel foam by a simple hydrothermal growth method. The NiO nanostructures were characterized by field emission electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The characterized NiO nanostructures were uniform, dense and polycrystalline in the crystal phase. In addition to this, the NiO nanostructures were used in the development of a zinc ion sensor electrode by functionalization with the highly selective zinc ion ionophore 12-crown-4. The developed zinc ion sensor electrode has shown a good linear potentiometric response for a wide range of zinc ion concentrations, ranging from 0.001 mM to 100 mM, with sensitivity of 36 mV/decade. The detection limit of the present zinc ion sensor was found to be 0.0005 mM and it also displays a fast response time of less than 10 s. The proposed zinc ion sensor electrode has also shown good reproducibility, repeatability, storage stability and selectivity. The zinc ion sensor based on the functionalized NiO nanostructures was also used as indicator electrode in potentiometric titrations and it has demonstrated an acceptable stoichiometric relationship for the determination of zinc ion in unknown samples. The NiO nanostructures-based zinc ion sensor has potential for analysing zinc ion in various industrial, clinical and other real samples.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Zinc ion is the most abundant heavy metal ion in the human body and the quantity of zinc ion in serum is around 10 \u03bcM. Zinc ion is an important constituent of a number of enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase, matrix metalloproteinase [1], and also helps in the maintenance of structural characteristics of gene transcription proteins such as zinc finger proteins, etc. [2,3]. In addition to this, high levels of zinc ions are found present in the brain in chelatable form [4], in the pancreas [5], and spermatozoa [6]. The function of chelatable zinc ion is to govern the neuronal transmission in excitatory nerve terminals [4], inhibits apoptosis [7], and leads to neuronal injury under acute conditions [8], epilepsy [9] and transient global ischemia [10]. Zinc ions also stimulate the formation of \u03b1-amyloid [11], which causes Alzheimer's disease. Excess of zinc ion can be toxic and pollute the environment as well as decrease the soil microbial activity [12,13]. Zinc ion is also found in food and agricultural wastes [14]. Because of the high quantity of zinc ion in the atmosphere, it can easily be ingested by the human body and may cause pulmonary manifestations, fevers, chills and gastroenteritis. Due to the above facts, it is very important to be able to detect trace quantities of zinc ion and abundant research on this topic is going on in many scientific fields such as medicinal and environmental analysis, etc. Many analytical techniques has been used for the determination of zinc ion, including UV-Vis spectroscopy [15], potentiometry [16] and flame atomic absorption spectrometry [17], inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICPAES) [18] and fluorescence methods [19,20]. These techniques have some limitations due to the completely filled d-orbital of zinc ion, which results in an absence of suitable spectroscopic or magnetic signals. Beside these analytical tools, ion selective electrodes (ISEs) are comparatively simple, cheap and fast. Many zinc ion selective electrodes based on different ionophores have been reported [21\u201326]. Currently, different selective and sensitive polyvinyl chloride (PVC) membrane-based ISEs for different metal cations have been reported [27\u201331] and a zinc ion sensor based on functionalised ZnO nanorods has also been published [32]. Moreover, a Schiff's base has also been used for the detection of zinc ion [33].", "Zinc ion is the most abundant heavy metal ion in the human body and the quantity of zinc ion in serum is around 10 \u03bcM.

The most distinguishing behaviour shown by nanostructures is their dimension-based excitation and emission. The electrical, optical, magnetic, and thermoelectric properties of solid-state functional materials can be controlled by the quantum confinement of electrons through the potential well of nanoscale based structures. Therefore, it is potentially important to grow such nanostructures which are very important for modern science and technology [34\u201337].

The as-grown NiO nanostructures exhibited good crystal quality and have shown a good potentiometric response in the development of a zinc ion-selective electrode. The NiO nanostructures-based zinc ion sensor electrode detected a wide linear range of zinc ion concentrations from 0.001 mM to 100 mM with a low limit of detection of 0.0005 mM. The sensitivity of the proposed zinc ion sensor was found to be of 36 mV/decade and the regression coefficient 0.99. Beside these characteristics, the zinc ion sensor electrode demonstrated good reproducibility, repeatability, and selectivity, a fast response time of less than 10 s and good storage stability. The zinc ion sensor electrode was also used as indicator electrode in potentiometric titrations. All the obtained results indicated that the proposed zinc ion sensor electrode has good potential for analysing zinc ions in industrial, clinical and other real samples.", "In this work, honeycomb-like nanostructures of NiO were grown on nickel foam and also functionalised with 12-crown-4 a selective zinc ion ionophore.
