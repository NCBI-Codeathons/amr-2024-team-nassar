["DNA replication inhibitors are utilized extensively in studies of molecular biology and as chemotherapy agents in clinical settings. The inhibition of DNA replication often triggers double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) at stalled DNA replication sites, resulting in cytotoxicity. In East Asia, some traditional medicines are administered as anticancer drugs, although the mechanisms underlying their pharmacological effects are not entirely understood. In this study, we screened Japanese herbal medicines and identified two benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs), berberine and coptisine. These alkaloids mildly induced DSBs, and this effect was dependent on the function of topoisomerase I (Topo I) and MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease. Biochemical analysis revealed that the action of BIAs involves inhibiting the catalytic activity of Topo I rather than inducing the accumulation of the Topo I-DNA complex, which is different from the action of camptothecin (CPT). Furthermore, the results showed that BIAs can act as inhibitors of Topo I, even against CPT-resistant mutants, and that the action of these BIAs was independent of CPT. These results suggest that using a combination of BIAs and CPT might increase their efficiency in eliminating cancer cells.", "Subject terms", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Natural medicines are commonly used worldwide for the treatment of endocrine and metabolic diseases, infections, and inflammatory symptoms1. In Japan, these medications are often combined with Western medicines to induce synergistic effects or mitigate the side effects of Western medicines1\u20133. Few natural medicines for cancer treatment are well understood4. However, numerous prototype compounds utilized as anticancer agents were discovered from medicinal plants, including camptothecin (CPT), etoposide, taxanes, and vinca alkaloids, and from bacteria, such as mitomycin and anthracyclines. Although these agents act against cancer using a variety of mechanisms, they can be classified into two major groups, namely, DNA replication inhibitors and mitosis inhibitors. DNA replication inhibitors are most frequently used in cancer treatment. CPT inhibits Topo I activity, and etoposide and anthracyclines inhibit topoisomerase II (Topo II) activity5. Because topoisomerases play a crucial role in DNA replication and chromosome partitioning, the inhibition of their activities results in the formation of DSBs in proliferating cells, which leads to selective cell death5,6. Mitomycin C tethers both strands of the DNA to yield interstrand DNA crosslinks, which results in the inhibition of DNA replication and DSB formation7,8. Mitosis inhibitors have also been discovered in medicinal plants. Taxanes stabilize the microtubule polymer and prevent its disassembly9, and vinca alkaloids block the polymerization of \u03b2-tubulin10.

CPT is classified as a monoterpene indole alkaloid and is produced by plants, such as Camptotheca acuminata, Ophiorrhiza pumila, Ophiorrhiza liukiuensis, and Nothapodytes foetida11,12. CPT functions to stabilize the DNA-Topo I complex, which results in the formation of single-strand breaks (SSBs) on the DNA13. The SSB formed by the Topo I-DNA complex might then be converted to a DSB through progression of the DNA replication fork14. The catalytic activity of Topo I is to cleave one of the two strands of double-stranded DNA and relax supercoiled DNA. The OH group of Tyr723 in human Topo I is the active site and cuts the phosphate group at the 3\u2032-end of the strand to form a binary DNA-Topo I covalent complex. After cleavage, the broken DNA strand can rotate around the unbroken strand and remove DNA supercoils, and cleaved strand is then rejoined. Thus, Topo I controls the topological state of DNA. Supercoiled DNAs typically appear in front of replication forks during DNA replication, and the dysfunction of Topo I due to treatment causes stalled replication forks15. Thus, CPT induces the accumulation of not only DNA replication-mediated DSB formation14 but also stalls DNA replication forks15, which results in cytotoxicity in proliferating cells. CPT is toxic to most eukaryotic organisms, such as yeasts, insects, plants, and mammals. Clearly, CPT-producing plants possess defence mechanisms to protect themselves against CPT. Topo I in CPT-producing plants contains specific amino acid substitutions that affect its resistance to CPT, such as N421K, L530I, and/or N722S (numbered according to human Topo I11). Because these residues are crucial for the interaction between CPT and Topo I, such substitutions lead to defects in this interaction and result in resistance in CPT-producing plants11. Similarly, CPT-resistant mutations in the TOP1 gene have also been discovered in human cancer cell lines that were generated as CPT-resistant lines in vitro, namely, R346H and D533G16. These residues also play an essential role in the interaction between CPT and Topo I. To date, many other mutations responsible for CPT resistance have been identified in the TOP1 gene17\u201319.

Therefore, we assessed whether combined treatment with aphidicolin could suppress the formation of BIA-induced DSBs. DSBs induced by herbal extracts from Phellodendron bark and Coptis rhizome were suppressed by combined treatment with aphidicolin (Fig.\u00a02a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a). Subsequently, the DSBs induced by treatment with berberine and coptisine were examined. Both the induction of DSBs by berberine and coptisine was suppressed by combined treatment with aphidicolin (Fig.\u00a02b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b). The DSBs suppressed by combined treatment with aphidicolin contained IdU, which suggests that BIA-induced DSBs primarily occurred at DNA replication sites. To assess whether BIA-induced DSBs were produced as a result of apoptosis, we examined whether BIA-induced DSB formation occurred in the presence of the apoptotic nuclease inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK25. As expected, BIA-induced DSB formation was not suppressed by combined treatment with Z-VAD-FMK (Fig.\u00a02c, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c). These results indicate that the DSBs induced by the aforementioned alkaloids are associated with DNA replication rather than apoptosis. We then followed the time course of BIA-induced DSBs in comparison to those induced by CPT. During treatment with CPT, DSBs started to accumulate after 4\u00a0h, and this accumulation continued to increase until 24\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a02d,e). However, only a slight accumulation of DSBs was observed after 4\u00a0h of treatment with berberine and coptisine, but no clear increase was observed from 4 to 24\u00a0h. This finding was different from the CPT results. An accumulation of DSBs was hardly observed after treatment with palmatine (Fig.\u00a02d,e, Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). To test its cytotoxic effect, we generated dose-dependent cell survival curves (Fig.\u00a02f,g). MRC5sv cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 24\u00a0h, and the medium was then refreshed. Following incubation, survival curves were determined based on the percentages of colony formation. The survival curves suggested that berberine and coptisine showed higher toxicities than palmatine; the lethal dose 50 (LD50) for berberine and coptisine was 8\u00a0\u03bcM, whereas that for palmatine was 80\u00a0\u03bcM. In addition, magnoflorine showed no toxicity until 100\u00a0\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a02f). These results are consistent with those from previous studies that assessed the cytotoxic activities of berberine and coptisine26,27. However, the cytotoxicities of berberine and coptisine was milder than those of etoposide and CPT, which are used in chemotherapy in the clinic (Fig.\u00a02f,g).Figure 3Analysis of Topo I inhibition by BIAs in vivo.

Previously, Regairaz et al. showed that the DNA replication fork collapsed by CPT was cleaved by MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonucleases41.

To address this, MUS81 was transiently depleted by siRNA transfection, and the BIA-induced formation of DSBs was analysed by PFGE.

We therefore examined whether these BIAs could inhibit CPT-resistant Topo I proteins in vitro. Recombinant proteins of wild-type Topo I mutations, namely, R364H, D533G, and N722S, were expressed in a baculovirus system and purified (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011a). The activities of the purified wild-type and mutant Topo I proteins were confirmed based on their relaxation activities using commercial untagged Topo I protein (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011b,c). The resistance of the mutant proteins to up to 200\u00a0\u03bcM CPT was confirmed (Fig.\u00a07b). A concentration of 200\u00a0\u03bcM was the maximum concentration that we could test because a higher concentration resulted in precipitation in the reaction buffer. In the case of wild-type Topo I, treatment with CPT induced nicked DNA by stabilizing the DNA-Topo I complex, and we were able to confirm this activity. Agarose gel electrophoresis without EtBr (-EtBr gel) showed the accumulation of relaxed/nicked DNA, and agarose gel electrophoresis with EtBr revealed the accumulation of nicked DNA in the presence of CPT at a concentration between 6.7 and 200\u00a0\u03bcM (+\u2009EtBr gel) (Fig.\u00a07b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a012a). Treatment with CPT could not induce the accumulation of nicked DNA when the R364H, D533G and N722S mutants were used (Fig.\u00a07a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a012a). Thereafter, the effects of the selected BIAs on the relaxation activities of CPT-resistant Topo I proteins were examined. As expected, the aforementioned BIAs inhibited CPT-resistant Topo I proteins in a comparable manner to that obtained with the wild-type Topo I protein (Fig.\u00a07c\u2013e, Supplementary Fig.\u00a012b\u2013d). This result suggests that the inhibition of Topo I by the aforementioned BIAs does not require the Arg364, Asp533, and Asn722 residues of Topo I, which indicates that the binding mode of berberine and coptisine that result in Topo I inhibition is different from that of CPT. The interaction modes of these alkaloids with Topo I differ from that of CPT. We then hypothesized that berberine and coptisine will maintain their cytotoxic activity against cells carrying CPT-resistant Top1 mutations. To assess this hypothesis, we employed two cell lines that carry the D533G and N722S mutations. As previously mentioned, these mutations result in defects in the interaction between CPT and Topo I. We obtained two CPT-resistant cell lines, namely, CPT-K5 carrying the D533G mutation16,35 and CEM/C2 carrying the N722S mutation16, as well as their control cell lines, RPMI8204 and CCRF-CEM, respectively (Fig.\u00a08). Because these cell lines are suspension-type cells, the survival curves of CPT and the aforementioned alkaloids were determined by MTT assays. First, we confirmed that CPT-K5 and CEM/C2 cells showed resistance to CPT compared with their control cells (Fig.\u00a08a,d). The CPT-K5 and CEM/C2 cells were then treated with the indicated BIAs, and their survival curves were determined. Both groups of CPT-resistant cells, namely, CPT-K5 and CEM/C2, were killed by BIAs at a dose comparable to that needed to eliminate their control cells (Fig.\u00a08b,c,e,f).

These results also indicate that BIAs independently act on CPT and that the action of berberine and coptisine against Topo I is independent of CPT.", "Based on these results, we concluded that both berberine and coptisine possess cytotoxic activity independent of CPT and can remove cells carrying CPT-resistant mutations in the TOP1 gene at a level comparable to that obtained with wild-type CPT-sensitive cells.", "Based on these results, we concluded that both berberine and coptisine possess cytotoxic activity independent of CPT and can remove cells carrying CPT-resistant mutations in the TOP1 gene at a level comparable to that obtained with wild-type CPT-sensitive cells.", "Based on these results, we concluded that both berberine and coptisine possess cytotoxic activity independent of CPT and can remove cells carrying CPT-resistant mutations in the TOP1 gene at a level comparable to that obtained with wild-type CPT-sensitive cells.", "Investigation of BIA-induced DSB formation in various cancer cell lines", "Investigation of BIA-induced DSB formation in various cancer cell lines", "Investigation of BIA-induced DSB formation in various cancer cell lines", "To assess whether treatments with berberine and coptisine can induce DSBs in cancer cell lines, we explored the accumulation of DSBs various cancer cell lines after treatment with 10\u00a0\u03bcM coptisine and berberine for 24\u00a0h by PFGE.

To discover additional substances with anticancer activity, we screened selected Japanese herbal medicines, and treatments with two extracts prepared from Phellodendron bark (#8) and Coptis rhizome (#10) induced accumulations of DSBs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). The analysis of available data for natural compounds revealed that berberine and palmatine are major components of these herbal medicines, and we subsequently identified berberine and coptisine. We cannot rule out the possibility that other compounds, including these herbal extracts, might have similar activity, but at least in this study, berberine and coptisine could induce DSBs by inhibiting Topo I function (Figs.\u00a01, 2, 3). The cytotoxic activities of berberine and coptisine have previously been reported26,27, but we investigated new aspects of these compounds. First, we found that at least one five-membered ring of coptisine and berberine plays a crucial role in the inhibitory effect of Topo I (Figs. 3, 4). It is likely that the conformational flexibility of the methoxy groups affects the interaction between BIA and DNA and/or BIA and Topo I. One possibility is that the DNA-binding activities of these alkaloids are involved in Topo I inhibition. In this study, we found that the DNA-binding affinities of berberine, coptisine, and palmatine were similar (Fig.\u00a03c) and not correlated with Topo I inhibition. Previous studies have suggested two distinct DNA interactions of berberine: one is through intercalation37,38, and the other involves what is known as minor groove-directed interaction39, where the binding occurs on the minor groove of the DNA and in which the convex side is linked to the helix groove. This finding implies that the DNA-binding mode might be involved in Topo I inhibition. However, Pilch et al. showed that not only intercalations but also minor groove-directed interactions were sufficient to inhibit human Topo I activity29. Therefore, it is unlikely that the DNA-binding mode is correlated with the inhibitory effect of berberine and coptisine on Topo I. Based on the aforementioned evidence, we hypothesized that berberine and coptisine block the catalytic function of Topo I by forming a stable interaction at the active site. Previously, the interaction of berberine, but not coptisine, with Topo I was investigated, and the results indicate that berberine is able to bind to the active site of Topo I, which is the same site to which CPT binds40. Berberine and coptisine might stably bind to the active site of Topo I, whereas palmatine could be slightly more unstable due to the movements of methoxy groups. Second, we found that the cytotoxic effects of berberine and coptisine against CPT-resistant cancer cells were comparable to those found with the control (CPT-sensitive) cells (Fig.\u00a08). The structural comparisons predicted that the binding modes of berberine and coptisine with Topo I were different from that of CPT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010), and we confirmed this phenomenon using CPT-resistant proteins and cells (Figs. 7, 8, 9). Based on the results, we identified berberine and coptisine as good candidates for use in combination with CPT to increase the effectiveness of cancer treatment and suppress CPT-resistant cancer cells.", "Pharmacologists have attempted to finding efficient methods for fighting diseases, including cancer1,36, for a long time, and natural medicines have been used in cancer treatments before modern anticancer agents were developed.

This certainly requires further investigation. First, we examined whether BIA-induced DSB formation was suppressed by cotreatment with aphidicolin. Previous studies have suggested that aphidicolin acts as an antagonist of CPT-induced DSB formation14 but not etoposide-induced DSB formation because etoposide has not only S phase-dependent toxicity but also S phase-independent toxicity24. BIA-induced DSB formation was largely suppressed by cotreatment with aphidicolin, and BIA-induced DSB formation associated with DNA replication occurred. Next, we accessed if SSB formed by the Topo I-DNA complex might be converted to a DSB through progression of the DNA replication fork or not. However, we could not detect the effect of berberine and coptisine in stabilizing the Topo I-DNA complex (Figs. 3b,d, 4, 5). Therefore, it is unlikely that an SSB formed by the Topo I-DNA complex might be converted to a DSB through progression of the DNA replication fork. Third, we explored the possibility that treatment with berberine and coptisine causes stalled DNA replication forks by inhibiting Topo I, and stalled DNA replication forks were cleaved by MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease, resulting in the formation of DSBs at DNA replication sites. Indeed, it is shown that the dysfunction of Topo I due to treatment causes stalled replication forks15, and the DNA replication fork collapsed by CPT was cleaved by MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonucleases41. Here we showed that BIA-induced DSB formation was dependent on the MUS81 function (Fig.\u00a06). Therefore, it is likely that some stalled replication forks might be cleaved by a MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease, which results in the formation of DSBs. Forth, we also detected that cells depleting Topo I by siRNA did not show DSB formation (Fig.\u00a03). Since Topo I is essential for DNA replication, the cell without Topo I cannot initiate DNA replication, whose situation is the similar to that treated with aphidicolin. It is likely that Topo I-depletion reduced the number of active DNA replication forks, and this automatically results in the reduction of stalled DNA replication forks by treatment with these BIAs. Thus, cells depleting Topo I by siRNA did not show DSB formation. Based on\u00a0these, we suggest that stalled replication forks induced by inactivation of Topo I function after treatment with berberine and coptisine must be cleaved by MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonucleases.", "Next, we tried to address the mechanism through which DSB formation occurs after treatment with berberine and coptisine, but we could not fully understand its mechanism.
