In order to cope with the complex and changeable living environment, streptomycetes evolved a set of protective mechanisms with competitive advantages [1], producing a large number of secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics with high medical value [2, 3]. Antibiotic biosynthesis is stringently controlled by precise and pyramidal regulatory cascades [4]. Streptomyces can monitor the environmental conditions, growing states, population density, and so on, and then secrete and sense specific signal small molecules named autoregulators, including \u03b3-butyrolactones (GBLs), antibiotics and biosynthetic intermediates [5\u20137]. Then, the receptors of autoregulators respond and transmit these signal inputs to corresponding transcriptional regulators of secondary metabolite, thereby regulating antibiotics biosynthesis. Transcriptional regulators in Streptomyces are usually classified as global/pleiotropic regulators and CSRs [8]. The global/pleiotropic regulators can not only regulate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, but also affect the morphological differentiation of Streptomyces [9, 10].

As reported, two ways have been found to be involved in DNA sequences recognition of proteins [47]. One way is directly based on contacts of amino acids and bases, and the flanking sequences are also important [48]. For example, the first and second flanking positions 5\u02b9 to the consensus DBS play important roles in DNA-binding affinity for E12 homodimer and E12-TAL1 heterodimer [49].

On the contrary, LmbU activates the transcription of SLINC_8097, which negatively regulates the production of lincomycin. This may be conducive to maintain the level of lincomycin within a certain range in vivo. These data revealed that the regulatory network of LmbU on lincomycin biosynthesis is complex and accurate. In addition, LmbU can bind to the promoter regions of SLINC_0585 (encode an MFS transporter), SLINC_6382 (encode an ABC transporter permease), SLINC_7298 (encode an MFS transporter), SLINC_6570 (encode an RNA polymerase sigma factor) and SLINC_1077 (encode a methyltransferase). The studies about the regulatory mechanisms of LmbU to these targets and the effects of these target genes on lincomycin biosynthesis are ongoing.", "According to the study, LmbU inhibited the transcription of SLINC_0469 and SLINC_1037, which negatively regulate the production of lincomycin, suggesting that LmbU affect the production of lincomycin not only by activating the lmb genes, but also by suppressing the genes against lincomycin biosynthesis. On the contrary, LmbU activates the transcription of SLINC_8097, which negatively regulates the production of lincomycin.

Based on this, we screened and identified the targets of LmbU which are located outside the lmb cluster, and showed the effect of these targets on production of lincomycin. The data elucidated that LmbU promotes lincomycin biosynthesis not only through regulating transcription of the lmb genes, but also by regulating three target genes outside the lmb cluster. In addition, the three targets SLINC_0469, SLINC_1037 and SLINC_8097 have been found negatively regulated lincomycin biosynthesis via regulating transcription of the lmb genes including lmbU, forming cross-regulation. This study can further illuminate the regulatory network of lincomycin biosynthesis, and will bring light to the functional analysis of LmbU family regulators.", "In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that LmbU functions as a CSR of lincomycin, and LmbU homologues are widely found in actinomycetes, but their positions on the chromosome are not limited to the antibiotic BGCs [27, 44].
