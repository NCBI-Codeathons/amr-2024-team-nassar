In this work we raised the hypothesis that under certain circumstances, production of antiproliferative agents could be part of a genetically programmed death of the producing organism. While programmed cell death (PCD) has been well documented when Streptomyces species switch from vegetative (nutrition) to aerial (reproduction) growth, lethal determinants are yet to be discovered. Using DNA-damaging prodiginines of Streptomyces coelicolor as model system, we revealed that, under certain conditions, their biosynthesis is always triggered in the dying zone of the mycelial network prior to morphological differentiation, right after an initial round of cell death. The programmed massive death round of the vegetative mycelium is absent in a prodiginine non-producer (\u0394redD strain), and mutant complementation restored both prodiginine production and cell death. The redD null mutant of S. coelicolor also showed increased DNA, RNA, and proteins synthesis when most of the mycelium of the wild-type strain was dead when prodiginines accumulated. Moreover, addition of the prodiginine synthesis inhibitors also resulted in enhanced accumulation of viable filaments. Overall, our data enable us to propose a model where the time-space production of prodiginines is programmed to be triggered by the perception of dead cells, and their biosynthesis further amplifies the PCD process. As prodiginine production coincides with the moment S. coelicolor undergoes morphogenesis, the production of these lethal compounds might be used to eradicate the obsolete part of the population in order to provide nutrients for development of the survivors. Hence, next to weapons in competition between organisms or signals in inter- and intra-species communications, we propose a third role for antibiotics (in the literal meaning of the word \u2018against life\u2019) i.e., elements involved in self-toxicity in order to control cell proliferation, and/or for PCD associated with developmental processes.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "Traditionally, bacteria were regarded as unicellular microorganisms that rapidly grow and divide via binary fission. The concept of multicellularity among prokaryotes was recognized only three decades ago, and is particularly evident in actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, and myxobacteria (Shapiro, 1998; Claessen et al., 2014). These are bacteria with a complex life cycle and morphological and chemical differentiations that are switched on in response to environmental signals. A hallmark of multicellular organisms is programmed cell death or PCD (Bayles, 2014; Claessen et al., 2014; Lyons and Kolter, 2015). In Bacillus subtilis, sporulation is preceded by a form of PCD known as cannibalism in a subpopulation of the biofilm, and serves to produce the building blocks required for a new round of macromolecule synthesis to sustain developmental growth (Gonz\u00e1lez-Pastor et al., 2003; Gonz\u00e1lez-Pastor, 2011). In Myxococcus, three subpopulations that show division of labor arise, with cells differentiating into spores or into peripheral rods, while the remaining cells undergo PCD (Nariya and Inouye, 2008). In the cyanobacterial Anabaena, cell death is controlled by the circadian rhythm, which implies careful programming (Lee and Rhee, 1999).", "Traditionally, bacteria were regarded as unicellular microorganisms that rapidly grow and divide via binary fission.

Streptomycetes are filamentous Gram-positive high G+C bacteria that reproduce via sporulation. Their life cycle starts with a spore that germinates to grow out and form a mycelium consisting of multinucleoid vegetative hyphae. When reproduction is required, the older mycelium is used as a substrate to form aerial hyphae, which differentiate into chains of unigenomic spores. This morphological differentiation is accompanied by chemical differentiation, whereby many natural products, including antibiotics, anticancer compounds and antifungals, are produced. The lytic degradation of the vegetative mycelium is a clear manifestation of PCD, presumably to provide the nutrients necessary to produce the reproductive aerial hyphae (M\u00e9ndez et al., 1985; Migu\u00e9lez et al., 1999; Manteca et al., 2005; Chater, 2006).", "Several rounds of PCD occur as part of the complex developmental program of the mycelial Streptomyces (Migu\u00e9lez et al., 1999, 2000; Fern\u00e1ndez and S\u00e1nchez, 2002; Manteca et al., 2005; Filippova and Vinogradova, 2017).

Antibiotic resistance is indeed mandatory for antibiotic makers such as streptomycetes, which infers that their \u2018weapons\u2019 against competitors are also often active against the producing species (Tomasz, 2006; Hopwood, 2007; Alkhatib et al., 2012; Mak et al., 2014; Ogawara, 2015; Sugiyama, 2015). To survive production of their natural products, Streptomyces possess self-defense mechanisms identical to those developed and acquired by human and animal pathogens (D\u2019Costa et al., 2006; Wright, 2012; Surette and Wright, 2017). Self-toxicity - and therefore self-resistance - extends well beyond antibacterial agents; for example, anticancer molecules damaging DNA are also deadly to the producer (Galm et al., 2005). Mechanisms of resistance to antitumor antibiotics that destroy DNA have been identified in almost all producers and include (i) drug sequestration, (ii) drug inactivation (modification or destruction), (iii) drug efflux, and (iv) target repair or protection (Tenconi and Rigali, 2018).", "The molecular triggers and genetic basis for PCD in mycelial bacteria are still largely unknown. \u2018Antibiotics\u2019 should be regarded as serious candidates for eliciting PCD processes.

Their topoisomerase-inhibiting activity by intercalating DNA and the many other ways they are harmful to cell components (Williamson et al., 2007; Darshan and Manonmani, 2016; Yang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) explains why prodiginines are toxic to so many different organisms and also display antimalarial, anthelmintic, antifungal, and antibacterial activities (Stankovic et al., 2014). Such a broad spectrum of activity suggests that the PdG-producing species might be sensitive to their own molecules. Indeed, in Streptomyces coelicolor the onset of expression of the red cluster (encoding the PdG biosynthetic pathway) coincides with the entrance of this species into a period of growth cessation \u2013 the so-called transition phase (Takano et al., 1992; Bibb, 1996; White and Bibb, 1997; Sun et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2005; Williamson et al., 2006). In addition, prodiginine production coincides with a round of massive cell death in the course of which the Streptomyces multicellular filamentous network undergoes drastic morphological changes associated with the sporulation process. Time-space monitoring of redD expression, the activator of PdGs red biosynthetic genes, is also confined to aging, lysed filaments (Sun et al., 1999). Moreover, prodigiosin-like pigments are induced by stressing culture conditions like excess of metal ions and pH shock (Mo et al., 2013; Morgenstern et al., 2015), co-cultivation with competing microorganisms (Luti and Mavituna, 2011b; Sch\u00e4berle et al., 2014), and feeding the medium with dead bacterial cells (Luti and Mavituna, 2011a). Finally, all other DNA-damaging agents have been shown to be toxic for the producing actinobacterial species (Tenconi and Rigali, 2018).

The seemingly suicidal and at the same time well-programmed production of prodiginines suggests that these molecules may play a role in the control and/or progress of PCD. An advantage of using PdGs as our model to correlate toxin biosynthesis to PCD is that the timing and localization of their production is easily monitored in situ due to their red autofluorescence (Tenconi et al., 2013). In this work we demonstrate that prodiginine production correlates to dying filaments in time and space and that absence of PdGs reduces cell death in S. coelicolor, resulting in hyper-accumulation of viable filaments.
