Increasingly, defensive metabolites that have been attributed to host biosynthetic capability are now being recognized as products of host-associated microbes. These unique metabolites often have bioactivity targets in human disease and can be purposed as pharmaceuticals. Polyketides are a complex family of natural products that often serve as defensive metabolites for competitive or pro-survival purposes for the producing organism, while demonstrating bioactivity in human diseases as cholesterol lowering agents, anti-infectives, and anti-tumor agents. Marine invertebrates and microbes are a rich source of polyketides. Palmerolide A, a polyketide isolated from the Antarctic ascidian Synoicum adareanum, is a vacuolar-ATPase inhibitor with potent bioactivity against melanoma cell lines. The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for production of secondary metabolites are encoded in the genomes of the producers as discrete genomic elements. A candidate palmerolide BGC was identified from a S. adareanum microbiome-metagenome based on a high degree of congruence with a chemical structure-based retrobiosynthetic prediction. Protein family homology analysis, conserved domain searches, active site and motif identification were used to identify and propose the function of the \u223c75\u00a0kbp trans-acyltransferase (AT) polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal synthase (PKS-NRPS) domains responsible for the stepwise synthesis of palmerolide A. Though PKS systems often act in a predictable co-linear sequence, this BGC includes multiple trans-acting enzymatic domains, a non-canonical condensation termination domain, a bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM), and is found in multiple copies within the metagenome-assembled genome (MAG). Detailed inspection of the five highly similar pal BGC copies suggests the potential for biosynthesis of other members of the palmerolide chemical family. This is the first delineation of a biosynthetic gene cluster from an Antarctic microbial species, recently proposed as Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus. These findings have relevance for fundamental knowledge of PKS combinatorial biosynthesis and could enhance drug development efforts of palmerolide A through heterologous gene expression.", "1 Introduction", "1 Introduction", "Marine invertebrates such as corals, sponges, mollusks, and ascidians are known to be a rich source of bioactive compounds (Carroll et al., 2019). Due to their sessile or sluggish nature, chemical defenses such as secondary metabolites are often key to their survival. Many compound classes are represented among benthic invertebrates including terpenes, nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) products, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), and polyketides. It is estimated that over 11,000 secondary metabolites from marine and terrestrial environments understood to be products of polyketide synthase (PKS) and NRPS origin have been isolated and described (Dejong et al., 2016). BGCs exist as a series of genomic elements that encode for the biosynthetic machinery responsible for production of these secondary metabolites. BGCs can have distinct nucleotide composition properties such as codon usage and guanine-cytosine content that do not match the remainder of the genome (Lawrence et al., 2002; Ravenhall et al., 2015), suggesting a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer from organisms that are distantly related, including across different kingdoms (Schmidt, 2008; Schmitt and Lumbsch, 2009). Interestingly, the BGCs for many natural products isolated from marine invertebrates are found in the host-associated microbiota, reflecting the role of these compounds in symbiosis (Schmidt, 2015).", "Marine invertebrates such as corals, sponges, mollusks, and ascidians are known to be a rich source of bioactive compounds (Carroll et al., 2019).

They often possess long carbon chains with varied degrees of oxidation, can contain aromatic components, and may be either cyclic or linear. It is estimated that of the polyketides that have been isolated and characterized, 1% have potential biological activity against human diseases, making this class of compounds particularly appealing from a drug discovery and development standpoint (Koskinen and Karisalmi, 2005). This potential for use as pharmaceuticals is approximately five times greater than for compounds of all other natural product classes (Koskinen and Karisalmi, 2005). Many polyketides are classified as macrolides, which are large-ring lactones that are pharmaceutically relevant due to a number of biological actions, including, targeting the cytoskeleton, ribosomal protein biosynthesis, and vacuolar type V-ATPases (Bordeleau et al., 2005; Nishimura et al., 2005; Napolitano et al., 2012; Ueoka et al., 2015). V-ATPases are responsible for acidification of cells and organelles via proton transport across membranes, including those of lysosomes, vacuoles, and endosomes. These enzymes appear to have an impact on angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and tumor metastasis (Napolitano et al., 2012). A number of marine macrolides inhibit V-ATPases, including lobatamides, chondropsins, iejimalides, and several of the palmerolides (Bowman et al., 2003; Shen et al., 2003; Diyabalanage et al., 2006; Kazami et al., 2006; Noguez et al., 2011).", "Polyketides are a complex family of natural products produced by a variety of PKS enzymes that are related to, but evolutionarily divergent from, fatty acid synthases (Helfrich and Piel, 2016).

Type I PKS systems in bacteria are primarily comprised of non-iteratively acting multimodular enzymes that lead to progressive elongation of a polyketide chain, though these megaenzymes can also include \u201cstuttering\u201d modules that may act iteratively (Wilkinson et al., 2000; Shen et al., 2007; Tatsuno et al., 2007). In addition, some bacterial Type I PKS systems are comprised solely of iteratively acting monomodular enzymes that catalyze a series of chain elongation steps for polyketide formation (Wang et al., 2020). Type II PKS systems typically contain separate, iteratively acting enzymes that biosynthesize polycyclic aromatic polyketides, while Type III PKS systems possess iteratively-acting homodimeric enzymes that often result in monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic polyketides (Shen et al., 2007). Type I PKS systems can be subdivided into two groups, depending upon whether the acyl transferase (AT) modules are encoded within each module at the site that is parallel to the functional role of the ATs, referred to as cis-AT Type I PKS, or physically distinct from the megaenzyme, which are referred to as trans-AT Type I PKS. In both cases, there are often parallel relationships between the genome order, the action of enzymatic modules, and the functional groups present in the growing polyketide chain, though in trans-AT systems deviations from these parallel relationships is more likely to be observed (Nguyen et al., 2008). In trans-AT systems, AT domains may be incorporated in a mosaic fashion through horizontal gene transfer (Nguyen et al., 2008). This introduces greater molecular architectural diversity over evolutionary time, as one clade of trans-ATs may select for a malonyl-CoA derivative, while the trans-AT domains in another clade may select for unusual or functionalized subunits (Haydock et al., 1995; Jenke-Kodama et al., 2005). Additionally, recombination, gene duplication, and conversion events can lead to further diversification of the resultant biosynthetic machinery (Nivina et al., 2019). Predictions regarding the intrinsic relationship between a secondary metabolite of interest, the biosynthetic megaenzyme, and the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) can be harnessed for natural product discovery and development (Kim et al., 2012; Videau et al., 2016; Greunke et al., 2018).", "There are three types of PKS systems.

For example, as seen in the kalimantacins (Mattheus et al., 2010), the carbamate on C-11 was hypothesized to be installed by a carbamoyl transferase (CT). The C-25 methyl group located on C-17 in the \u03b2-position to the carbonyl suggests the origin of this branch is likely from hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HCS) catalysis, rather than SAM-mediated methylation, which occurs at the \u03b1-position to the carbonyl. Methylation at the site of the \u03b2-carbonyl is unusual, but represented in a number of notable BGCs, such as those of the jamaicamides, bryostatins, curacin A, oocydin, pederin, and psymberin, among others; in biochemically characterized Type I PKS BGCs, HCS-mediated \u03b2-branch formation is the common mechanism (Chang et al., 2004; Edwards et al., 2004; Sudek et al., 2007; Fisch et al., 2009; Matilla et al., 2012).

Structure-activity relationship studies demonstrate the importance of the C-10 hydroxyl group and the C-11 carbamate (Nicolaou et al., 2008a). The KR domain predicting the C-11 alcohol function serves as the substrate for the carbamoyl transferase (palQ) in a post-translational modification (Haydock et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2009; Mihali et al., 2011). Intriguingly, a domain annotated as a luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM) in module 9 initially seemed out of place. However, palmerolide A has a hydroxy group at C-10, which represents an \u03b1-hydroxylation. LLMs associated with BGCs may not serve as true luciferases, but, instead, demonstrate oxidizing effects on polyketides and peptides without evidence of corresponding bioluminescence (El-Sayed et al., 2001; Maier et al., 2015). For example, there is an overrepresentation of LLMs in Candidatus Entotheonella BGCs without known bioluminescence (Lackner et al., 2017). As demonstrated through individual inactivation of the LLM in the BGC of mensacarin, a Type II PKS system, Msn02, Msn04, and Msn08 have key activity as epoxidases and hydroxlases (Maier et al., 2015). There are several examples of LLMs in modular Type I PKS systems. OnnC from onnamide and NazB from nazumamide are two LLMs in Candidatus Endotheonella that are proposed to serve biosynthetically as hydroxylases (Lackner et al., 2017). In calyculin and mandelalide, the CalD and MndB LLMs catalyze chain shortening reactions through \u03b1-hydroxylation and Baeyer-Villiger-type oxidation reactions (Wakimoto et al., 2014; Lopera et al., 2017). Phormidolide has a LLM that adds a hydroxy group, which is hypothesized to attack an olefin through a Michael-type addition for cyclization with enzymatic assistance from a pyran synthase (Bertin et al., 2016). The hydroxylation that is key in cyclization of oocydin A is likely installed by OocK or OocM, flavin-dependent monooxygenases that are contiguous to the PKS genes and are thought to act while the substrate is bound to a portion of the PKS megaenzyme (Matilla et al., 2012). It is this hydroxylase activity that we propose for the LLM in module 9. Since the producing bacteria is yet to be cultured, it is not established whether this LLM may also serve a role in bioluminescence and/or quorum sensing. Further evidence for the role of the LLM is provided through alignment against other LLMs. In addition to the annotation within Pfam00296, which includes the bacterial LLMs, the sequence aligns with the hidden Markov models of the TIGR subfamily 04020, which contains natural product biosynthesis LLMs (Lackner et al., 2017).

LLMs associated with BGCs may not serve as true luciferases, but, instead, demonstrate oxidizing effects on polyketides and peptides without evidence of corresponding bioluminescence (El-Sayed et al., 2001; Maier et al., 2015).

KS domains catalyze the sequential two-carbon elongation steps through a Claisen-like condensation with a resulting \u03b2-keto feature (Khosla et al., 2007). Additional domains within a given module can modify the \u03b2-carbonyl or add functionality to the adjacent \u03b1- or \u03b3-positions (Keatinge-Clay, 2012). Specificity of KSs, based on the types of modification located on the upstream acetate subunit were determined and found to be mostly consistent with our retrobiosynthetic predictions (Supplementary Figure S4, Supplementary Table S2). For example, the first KS, KS1 (module 1), is predicted to receive a subunit containing a \u03b2-branch. KS3 (module 4) and KS4 (module 5) are predicted to receive an upstream monomeric unit with \u03b1-methylation and an olefinic shift, consistent with the structure of palmerolide A and with the enzymatic transformations resulting from module 3 and module 4, respectively.

Palmerolide H (Figure 4) also likely arises from these two BGCs although it includes the structural differences of both palmerolide B and palmerolide D in which it contains the extended carboxylate tail with a terminal olefin and incorporates hydroxylation on C-8 rather than C-10. Again, there is no genomic evidence that this hydroxylation in the \u03b1-position is due to incorporation of hydroxymalonate to explain this but is instead likely due to a trans-acting hydroxylase. The carbamate installation occurs on C-7, while sulfonation occurs on C-11 and \u03b1-hydroxy placement is on C-8.", "The final two pal BGCs are shorter with a reduced number of biosynthetic modules found compared to pal BGC 4. The gene structure of pal BGC 5 (Supplementary Figure S6) shows preservation of many of the core biosynthetic genes; however, there are no pre-NRP PKS modules noted in the BGC. The HCS cassette, glycosyl transferase, and CT are all present downstream. The predicted product of this cluster does not correspond with a known palmerolide, though post-translational hydrolysis of the C-24 amide may result in a structure similar to palmerolide E (Figure 4), which maintains much of the structure of palmerolide A; however, it is missing the initial polyketide starter unit and the glycine subunit. The final pal BGC in Ca. Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, pal BGC 2 (Supplementary Figure S7), includes only five elongating modules, which would result in a 10-carbon structure that has not been isolated. Interestingly, despite the shortened BGC, the HCS cassette, glycosyl transferase, and CT are all present downstream, and the sequence itself aligns perfectly with few SNPs to the other BGCs (Murray et al., 2021). There would only be a single hydroxy group serving as a substrate for the CT, glycosyl transferase, and sulfatase to act. The 2-carbon site of action for the \u03b2-branch introduced in the palmerolide A structures would not be present. The structure-based retrobiosynthesis of the eight known palmerolides (A-F) can be hypothesized to arise from differences in the core biosynthetic genes of these non-identical copies of the pal BGC, starter unit promiscuity, and differing sites of action in the trans-acting enzymes.", "The final two pal BGCs are shorter with a reduced number of biosynthetic modules found compared to pal BGC 4.

As outlined in this retrobiosynthetic strategy, the pal BGC represents a trans-AT Type I PKS-NRPS hybrid system with compelling alignment to the predicted biosynthetic steps for palmerolide A. The pal BGC is proposed to begin with PKS modules resulting in the incorporation of an isovaleric acid derivative, 3-methylcrotonic acid, as a starter unit, followed by incorporation of a glycine residue with NRPS-type modules. Thereafter, eleven rounds of progressive polyketide elongation likely occur and leading to varying degrees of oxidation introduced with each module. There are several interesting non-canonical domains encoded within the BGC, such as an HCS, CT, LLM, and a truncated condensation termination domain. Additionally, a glycosylation domain may be responsible for reversible, pro-drug formation to produce self-resistance to the V-ATPase activity of palmerolide A. There are several additional domains, the function of which have yet to be determined.", "The putative pal BGC has been described and represents the first BGC elucidated from an Antarctic organism (Murray et al., 2021).

There are a total of five distinct pal BGCs in the MAG of Ca. Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, predicted to yield the known eight palmerolides, with genetic differences that explain some of the structural variety seen within this family of compounds. These include differences in modules that comprise the core biosynthetic genes. Additionally, it is proposed that some of the architectural diversity of palmerolides arises from different sites of action of the trans-acting, or non-colinear, modules. Starter unit promiscuity is another potential source of the structural differences observed in the compounds. Analysis of the pal BGC not only provides insight into the architecture of this Type I PKS-NRPS hybrid BGC with unique features, but also lays the foundational groundwork for drug development studies of palmerolide A via heterologous expression.", "A combination of modular alterations, starter unit differences, and activity of trans-acting enzymes contributes to Nature\u2019s production of a suite of palmerolide analogues.
