["Abstract", "Abstract", "Tobramycin is an essential and extensively used broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic obtained through alkaline hydrolysis of carbamoyltobramycin, one of the fermentation products of Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius. To simplify the composition of fermentation products from industrial strain, the main byproduct apramycin was blocked by gene disruption and constructed a mutant mainly producing carbamoyltobramycin. The generation of antibiotics is significantly affected by the secondary metabolism of actinomycetes which could be controlled by modifying the pathway-specific regulatory proteins within the cluster. Within the tobramycin biosynthesis cluster, a transcriptional regulatory factor TobR belonging to the Lrp/AsnC family was identified. Based on the sequence and structural characteristics, tobR might encode a pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory factor during biosynthesis. Knockout and overexpression strains of tobR were constructed to investigate its role in carbamoyltobramycin production. Results showed that knockout of TobR increased carbamoyltobramycin biosynthesis by 22.35%, whereas its overexpression decreased carbamoyltobramycin production by 10.23%. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments confirmed that TobR interacts with DNA at the adjacent tobO promoter position. Strains overexpressing tobO with ermEp* promoter exhibited 36.36% increase, and tobO with kasOp* promoter exhibited 22.84% increase in carbamoyltobramycin titer. When the overexpressing of tobO and the knockout of tobR were combined, the production of carbamoyltobramycin was further enhanced. In the shake-flask fermentation, the titer reached 3.76\u00a0g/L, which was 42.42% higher than that of starting strain. Understanding the role of Lrp/AsnC family transcription regulators would be useful for other antibiotic biosynthesis in other actinomycetes.", "Tobramycin is an essential and extensively used broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic obtained through alkaline hydrolysis of carbamoyltobramycin, one of the fermentation products of Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius.

The fermented products are commonly utilized in the industry for producing tobramycin via alkaline hydrolysis (Koch et al. 1973). Tobramycin is an essential and extensively used broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the aminoglycoside (Park et al. 2013). It was primarily employed clinically for treating severe infectious diseases caused by Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Wang et al. 2012; Wasserman et al. 2015). Additionally, it exhibited bactericidal effect, even in treating multi-drug resistant microorganisms (MDR) (Pagkalis et al. 2011; Rosalia et al. 2022). The antibacterial mechanism of action involves the binding of tobramycin to the aminoacyl-tRNA recognition site (A-site) on the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, which prevents formation of the normal 70S complex and inhibits protein translation ultimately leading to bacterial death. Furthermore, the deoxygenation at C-3\u2032 reduces the susceptibility to phosphorylation of tobramycin and thereby enhances its efficacy as an antibiotic (Kim et al. 2016).", "Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius, also known as Streptomyces tenebrarius (Tamura et al. 2008), is an actinomycete that produces carbamoyltobramycin through fermentation.

However, these traditional breeding methods have limitations of low effectiveness and a demand of an extensive time and labor investment. During the past two decades, various antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified (Kudo and Eguchi 2009).

Genetic modification of the related genes could be carried out based on the analysis of gene clusters and modern molecular biology technology to improve the metabolic and production performance of strains. Firstly, blocking byproduct biosynthesis pathway may increase the proportion of main product in fermentation (Hong and Yan 2012; Ni et al. 2011; Xiao et al. 2014). Secondly, increased copy number of entire biosynthetic gene clusters could also be beneficial to improve secondary metabolite production (Chen et al. 2010; Mitousis et al. 2021). However, since Streptomyces have the linear chromosomes and plasmids (Chen et al. 2002), such engineered high-yield strains may be genetically unstable due to the presence of large segments of duplication within the genomes.

In addition, the Tb-\u25b3aprQ and Tb-\u25b3aprI mutants showed new peaks on the HPLC spectrum. Due to the blockage of the biosynthetic pathway of apramycin, there may be an accumulation of intermediate products, and the new peak appeared after the aprQ was knocked out could be lividamine or 6\u2032-dehydro-6\u2032-oxoparomamine (Wang et al. 2021). Furthermore, the new compound appearing in the Tb-\u25b3aprI strain might be N\u2019-demethyl-apramycin (Zhang et al. 2022a). As for Tb-\u25b3aprJ and Tb-\u25b3aprK, the fermentation of carbamoyltobramycin was not affected, and the byproduct was almost completely removed. And there was no significant changes observed in the process of cell growth and spore synthesis for Tb-\u25b3aprJ and Tb-\u25b3aprK. The mutant Tb-\u25b3aprJ was selected for further research due to its slightly higher production of 2.64 g/L carbamoyltobramycin compared with 2.59 g/L of Tb-\u25b3aprK. Overall, blocking the biosynthesis of apramycin in this work did not have a significant impact on the production of carbamoyltobramycin. Actually, the effect of blocking apramycin synthesis on production of carbamoyltobramycin was strain-specific. For example, by blocking the biosynthesis of apramycin in strains S. tenebrarius Tt49, the production of carbamoyltobramycin was increased by sixfold in the study of Hong (Hong and Yan 2012) and by 9% in the study of Xiao (Xiao et al. 2014). However, Lena Mitousis et al. found that blocking the biosynthesis of apramycin decreased the production of carbamoyltobramycin by 35% in S. tenebrarius 2444 (Mitousis et al. 2021). We found that the starting strains S. tenebrarius Tt49 that Xiao and Hong used mainly produced apramycin, while the proportion of apramycin and carbamoyltobramycin in S. tenebrarius 2444 that Lena Mitousis used was similar. And the proportion of apramycin was only 14.8% of carbamoyltobramycin in our starting strain S. tenebrarius Tb. Hence, effect of knocking out the gene of apramycin biosynthesis pathway on the carbamoyltobramycin synthesis would be strain-specific.Fig. 2Elimination of apramycin in S. tenebrarius.\na HPLC chromatogram of Tb and mutants.

The increase in tobO transcription level can significantly promote the biosynthesis of tobramycin, while the knockout of tobO did not have an inhibitory effect.

The transporter TobT may play a very important role in the biosynthesis of tobramycin, and TobR may be involved in the efflux of products or substrate uptake during the secondary metabolism of tobramycin. An increase in TobT transcription level can promote the biosynthesis of tobramycin. And protein TobO was identified as an \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent non-haem iron amino acid oxidase in S. tenebrarius with bioinformatics analysis. Members of the \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent non-haem iron enzyme superfamily are widely found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea. These enzymes typically require Fe2+ as a metal cofactor and \u03b1-ketoglutarate as a co-substrate for catalysis of various reactions such as hydroxylation, ring cleavage, C\u2013C bond cleavage, cis\u2013trans isomerization, desaturation, intramolecular peroxidation, and heterocycle formation (Gao et al. 2018). Overexpression of tobO promoted the biosynthesis of carbamoyltobramycin, and no synthesis blockade or inhibition phenomenon was observed in the knockout strain. Protein function analysis suggested that the catalytic reaction of TobO was not involved in the biosynthetic pathway of carbamoyltobramycin. TobO does not directly provide precursor substances for biosynthesis of carbamoyltobramycin or modify secondary metabolites and intermediate products. The \u03b1-ketoglutarate were produced through transamination reactions. Subsequently, under the catalytic action of \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent non-haem iron enzymes, succinate is generated from \u03b1-ketoglutarate and enters central metabolism (Hu et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2022b). The overexpression of TobR may enhance the decomposition and utilization of amino acids, thereby providing more energy and material for central metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Under conditions of higher material and energy utilization efficiency, TobO might promote the growth of mycelium at the primary metabolic stage and provide more producer for the production of secondary metabolite when entering the product synthesis stage. Additionally, adjusting the metabolic flux leads to a reduction in glucose metabolism while increasing the use of amino acids in the system.
