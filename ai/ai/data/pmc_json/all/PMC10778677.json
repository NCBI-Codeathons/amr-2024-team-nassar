["There has been a widespread adoption of hypomethylating agents (HMA: 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza)/decitabine) and venetoclax (Ven) for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, the mechanisms behind the combination\u2019s synergy are poorly understood. Monotherapy often encounters resistance, leading to suboptimal outcomes; however, the combination of HMA and Ven has demonstrated substantial improvements in treatment responses. This study elucidates multiple synergistic pathways contributing to this enhanced therapeutic effect. Key mechanisms include HMA-mediated downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, notably MCL-1, and the priming of cells for Ven through the induction of genes encoding pro-apoptotic proteins such as Noxa. Moreover, Ven induces sensitization to HMA, induces overcoming resistance by inhibiting the DHODH enzyme, and disrupts antioxidant pathways (Nrf2) induced by HMA. The combination further disrupts oxidative phosphorylation in leukemia stem cells, amplifying the therapeutic impact. Remarkably, clinical studies have revealed a favorable response, particularly in patients harboring specific mutations, such as IDH1/2, NPM1, CEBPA, or ASXL1. This prompts future studies to explore the nuanced underpinnings of these synergistic mechanisms in AML patients with these molecular signatures.", "1. Introduction", "1.

Conclusions", "4. Conclusions", "The combination of HMA\u2013Ven has emerged as a promising and effective therapeutic strategy for older or unfit adults with myeloid malignancies. In this review, we highlighted the evolution of this combination (starting from the resistance mechanisms to Ven or HMA monotherapy) from preclinical studies to its FDA approval in 2020, emphasizing its success in both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML populations. The preclinical data presented in this review elucidate several synergistic mechanisms of the Ven\u2013HMA combination. It is clear that the combination synergizes in more than one way. Notably, the down-regulation of MCL-1 by HMAs and the disruption of energy metabolism and targeting of leukemia stem cells by the Ven\u2013HMA combination play an important role in promoting the observed synergy. The induction of ROS-dependent antileukemic activity and the \u201cpriming\u201d of AML cells for Ven-induced apoptosis by HMAs further contribute to the combination\u2019s efficacy. Ven and HMA augment each other in a subset of the population with specific molecular aberrations. Certain molecular mutations (IDH, NPM1, CEBPA, and ASXL1 mutations) have been found to be predictors of good response to combination therapy in clinical studies. Numerous other factors, such as monocytic leukemia phenotype and signaling pathway mutations, confer resistance. Further exploration and understanding of these nuanced underpinnings of negative predictors in myeloid malignancies will help inform effective precision trials in the future. Similarly, the exact mechanisms contributing to synergy require further mechanistic studies to elucidate putative foundations for future clinical trials.", "The combination of HMA\u2013Ven has emerged as a promising and effective therapeutic strategy for older or unfit adults with myeloid malignancies. In this review, we highlighted the evolution of this combination (starting from the resistance mechanisms to Ven or HMA monotherapy) from preclinical studies to its FDA approval in 2020, emphasizing its success in both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML populations. The preclinical data presented in this review elucidate several synergistic mechanisms of the Ven\u2013HMA combination. It is clear that the combination synergizes in more than one way. Notably, the down-regulation of MCL-1 by HMAs and the disruption of energy metabolism and targeting of leukemia stem cells by the Ven\u2013HMA combination play an important role in promoting the observed synergy. The induction of ROS-dependent antileukemic activity and the \u201cpriming\u201d of AML cells for Ven-induced apoptosis by HMAs further contribute to the combination\u2019s efficacy. Ven and HMA augment each other in a subset of the population with specific molecular aberrations. Certain molecular mutations (IDH, NPM1, CEBPA, and ASXL1 mutations) have been found to be predictors of good response to combination therapy in clinical studies. Numerous other factors, such as monocytic leukemia phenotype and signaling pathway mutations, confer resistance. Further exploration and understanding of these nuanced underpinnings of negative predictors in myeloid malignancies will help inform effective precision trials in the future.

However, the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2 could antagonize BAX and BAK, thereby preventing apoptosis [25]. The BCL-2 antagonism by Ven counteracts this, promoting leukemic cell death and may explain the positive response in IDH1/2 mutant AML with Ven\u2013HMA therapy.
