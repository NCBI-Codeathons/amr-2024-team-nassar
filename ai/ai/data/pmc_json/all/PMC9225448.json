["Marine natural products (MNPs) are an important source of biologically active metabolites, particularly for therapeutic agent development after terrestrial plants and nonmarine microorganisms. Sequencing technologies have revealed that the number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in marine microorganisms and the marine environment is much higher than expected. Unfortunately, the majority of them are silent or only weakly expressed under traditional laboratory culture conditions. Furthermore, the large proportion of marine microorganisms are either uncultivable or cannot be genetically manipulated. Efficient heterologous expression systems can activate cryptic BGCs and increase target compound yield, allowing researchers to explore more unknown MNPs. When developing heterologous expression of MNPs, it is critical to consider heterologous host selection as well as genetic manipulations for BGCs. In this review, we summarize current progress on the heterologous expression of MNPs as a reference for future research.", "1. Introduction", "1.

So apparently, the OSMAC strategy does not work in unculturable strains, and this strategy requires a relatively large experimental volume for strains with low production of MNPs. In addition, the supplementation of the medium with chromatin modifiers (such as histone deacetylase inhibitors) is not able to activate the cryptic BGCs in all species of fungi [25].

A heterologous expression platform for marine microorganisms and marine environment samples in the engineered chassis strains provides a feasible method for the efficient production of MNPs, especially for the exploration of fungal MNPs. Fungi can produce a large number of bioactive metabolites [30], but due to the lack of mature fermentation technology and genetic manipulation tools, fungal MNPs rely heavily on a universal heterologous expression platform. The heterologous expression of terrestrial fungal NPs has made some progress, but most of the heterologous expression of MNPs is still focused on marine bacteria. The heterologous expression of MNPs has the following four advantages. First, a successful heterologous expression allows the correct DNA ligation and efficient co-work of all essential gene fragments in BGCs which indicate the biosynthesis of MNPs. Second, heterologous expression can biosynthesize MNPs from unculturable marine microorganisms and environment samples. Third, heterologous expression relies on a suitable host, reducing the burden of developing novel genetic tools for different strains. Fourth, the library of biosynthetic genes can be continuously updated and optimized, not only for heterologous expression, but also for the genetic manipulation of cloned pathways, biosynthetic studies, or gene remodeling of BGCs [10]. So far, the heterologous expression of MNPs has made several remarkable advances in expressing BGCs from marine actinomycetes [31] and cyanobacteria [32], which exhibits promising prospects for extending this strategy into more marine microorganisms. Efficient heterologous expression first requires the selection and optimization of a suitable heterologous host.

In the end, using methods such as metabolic engineering can mass-produce specific MNPs for clinical research and therapeutic use [10,21,33]. Metagenomics shows an extraordinary potential in the heterologous expression of BGCs for MNPs (Figure 1), since this strategy directly extracts the total community DNA from marine samples without the need for the isolation or culture of microbes [34]. The combination of metagenomics and efficient bioactivity screening has become an effective method to identify novel bioactivities from inseparable marine microorganisms [6,12]. A marine metagenomic library was constructed from tidal flat sediments by Fujita et al. [27].

It is clear that the intactness and arrangement of BGCs determine the expression at the genetic level, while the cloning of BGCs usually larger than 10 kb is not so simple. Meanwhile, the endogenous metabolic pathways of the hosts can affect the structures of MNPs, and the mechanisms are difficult to demonstrate and vary from host to host.

When selecting the heterologous hosts, the characters of BGCs must be considered, including the required substrates, as well as the genetic and physiological properties of the original strains. In general, the closer the host is to the original strain, the more likely the transcription factors (such as regulatory factors, promoters, and ribosomal binding sites) of exogenous BGCs in hosts will work [37,38], due to the similar codon usage patterns shared by the evolutionarily closed strains and therefore, the higher translation efficiency. Each amino acid can be encoded by different synonymous codons whose frequencies vary with different species and the synonymous codon replacement in heterologous hosts would influence the secondary and tertiary protein structures [39]. Moreover, in closely related heterologous hosts, the exchange of promoters can improve the level of expression and thus increase the yield of target compound [40].

Known or predicted cyanobacterial MNPs account for approximately 20% of marine-derived small molecules currently used in clinical trials as well as the treatment of cancer, neurological disorders, infectious diseases, anti-inflammatory, and UV protection [90,91,92]. The molecular structures of cyanobacterial MNPs differ from terrestrial and freshwater species [93]. Cyanobacterial MNPs consist of nitrogen-rich scaffolds with distinguished structural diversity and usually have halogenated, methylated, and oxidative modifications [94]. Cyanobacterial MNPs are typically produced by PKS, NRPS, or a hybrid PKS/NRPS pathway with multiple tailoring steps [95]. Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 is a filamentous freshwater cyanobacterial strain that has been used as a model organism to study cellular differentiation, hydrogen production, and nitrogen reduction [58]. It has not been reported that PCC 7120 produces its own bioactive metabolites from the NRPS/PKS clusters, which provides a clear and clean compound background for genetic manipulation. In addition, PCC 7120 can apply established genetic tools and recognize the promoters of BGCs from different marine cyanobacteria, which can be used as an ideal heterologous host to express cyanobacterial MNPs.

The selection of a suitable host combined with the stable expression of exogenous genes after genetic engineering in hosts provide an important fundamental for biosynthesis and molecular engineering to study new MNPs. At present, two regulation methods for BGCs have been applied to develop MNPs, including (1) activating the cryptic pathway with a strong promoter; and (2) supplementing and directing the transport of precursor molecules.", "Although the heterologous expression of BGCs in model hosts is a robust way to increase the production of MNPs, it still faces many problems due to the difference between the host and native strains in metabolic regulation, precursor supply, auxiliary factors, and the self-resistance, such as the lack of regulation of gene expression, the difficulty of recruiting the premise modules, and the inefficient transcription and translation of BGCs [13,33]. Therefore, it is important to rationally design and regulate BGCs and heterologous hosts to improve the biosynthetic efficiency of MNPs. At the same time, the expression of known BGCs in heterologous hosts may lead to the generation of new derivatives, which may be the result of incompatible metabolic systems or nonpathway modification of compounds by endogenous enzymes [40]. Kim et al. [41] heterologously expressed the entire barbamide BGC in an engineered strain of S. venezuelae DHS 2001 in which the picromycin PKS BGC was deleted, and obtained 4-O-Demethylbarbamide, a new derivative of barbamide which lacks one O-methyl.

Thus, the heterologous expression of BGCs requires the simultaneous high-level expression of multiple promoters and controllable initiation of MNP biosynthesis under appropriate circumstances. Currently, constitutive promoters from housekeeping genes and inducible promoters from major metabolic genes are often used to drive the expression of BGCs in commonly used heterologous expression systems [21]. Bauman et al. [49] discovered, cloned, reconstructed, and heterologously expressed a cryptohybrid phenoazine-type BGC (spz) from the marine actinomycetes Streptomyces sp. CNB-091. The researchers introduced three promoter cassettes to reconstitute the spz cluster. An engineered bidirectional promoter combining the strong synthetic promoters p21 and sp44 was introduced into the cluster to control the biosynthesis of the core genes; the actI promoter was used to control the PKS gene of the spz cluster; the ermE* promoter was used to regulate the expression of the cytochrome bd oxidase gene. Overexpression of the spz cluster increased the yield and chemical diversity of phenazine MNPs, and the researchers detected at least 38 streptomycin phenazines from the fermentation liquor.", "Promoters are critical for transcription, while endogenous promoters of BGCs are usually not compatible with heterologous hosts unless they are closely related enough to successfully initiate gene transcription and regulation [123].

BGC hli (47.8 kb), which encodes haliangicin, has been identified and expressed in Myxococcus xanthus to assure the efficient production of haliangicin. It showed that the titer of haliangicin increased significantly when the precursor concentration was greater than 50 mM. When the concentration reached 200 mM, haliangicin at a concentration of 11.0 \u00b1 2.1 mg/L was detected after 5 d.

By using CRISPR-Cas9, researchers are able to delete or replace the predicted key gene loci of connate BGCs in host strains, blocking these biosynthetic pathways, reducing the production of SMs and thus forcing more substrates to get involved in the biosynthesis of exogenous BGCs. Moreover, researchers can use CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock-in strategy to precisely introduce promoter cassettes to replace original promoter regions, which might stimulate the high expression of inserted BGCs or produce new derivatives. Several experiments have succeeded in activating Streptomyces and cyanobacteria BGCs [126,127], and the CRISPR-Cas9 technique can possibly be extended to more heterologous expression systems. For microalgal hosts, TALEN (Transcription activator-like effector nucleases) [128] could be a feasible genome editing approach. TALEN introduces double strand breaks at a specific locus and causes the host to self-repair the damage. If a DNA sequence with a strong homology to the sequence around the cutting site is provided, the HR mechanism in cells works and use the provided DNA sequence as a template to repair the break, which achieves the accurate replacement of DNA.

Conclusions", "4. Conclusions", "The marine environment covers millions of phylogenetically distinct microorganisms, providing a treasure trove of biochemical diversity. The marine environment has unique characteristics compared with other terrestrial ecosystems, which are often reflected in the physicochemical properties and bioactivity of MNPs [130]. However, the biosynthetic pathways of most MNPs remain underexplored. Moreover, many marine strains have low or no expression of BGCs on usual standard media, resulting in low natural yields or the inability to synthesize MNPs [131,132,133]. An effective way to mine potential MNPs is through the heterologous expression of BGCs, expressing exogenous target BGCs in characterized hosts, and using advanced genetic engineering techniques to regulate this process [13,134,135]. With advances in DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools, researchers have identified a huge potential for untapped MNPs biosynthesis. Compared to terrestrial compounds, the development of MNPs biosynthesis in heterologous hosts has barely started. Natural products from land have undergone biosynthesis with heterologous expression, with 40 from fungi alone [21], whereas only 46 BGCs from marine bacteria, fungi, cyanobacteria, microalgae, and marine metagenomes have been studied with heterologous expression as mentioned in this review. Therefore, the heterologous expression of cryptic or unknown MNPs BGCs is likely to be the next research front. The biggest obstacle for exploiting MNPs is how to mimic the culture environment, such as the adjustment of the pH, salt concentration, and composition at seawater level, let alone microbes growing near hydrothermal vents and the deep trench. Among microorganisms, it is harder for a fungal host to coexpress the entire BGC, which requires the coordination of multiple promoters working at the appropriate time [21]. Moreover, genetic manipulations are relatively intractable in more complex fungal hosts. However, generally, fungal BGCs are more likely to heterologously express in the fungal hosts. The above problems, therefore, might combine to cause difficulties for the heterologous expression of marine-derive fungal BGCs.", "The marine environment covers millions of phylogenetically distinct microorganisms, providing a treasure trove of biochemical diversity.
