In these SVs and InDels, there are no functionally known genes directly related to the biosynthetic pathway of norvancomycin and its precursors based on their functional annotation. Thus, the genomic variations of industrial strain would be difficult to give a simple explanation on its high-yield production of norvancomycin. Since some key enzymes of primary metabolism were found in these SVs and InDels, or in flanking segments, we speculated that these genomic mutations may change the metabolic flow by affecting expression of the important enzymes of primary metabolism. Meanwhile, more than ten regulatory genes were detected in SVs and InDels.

RNA from NCPC 2-48 and CPCC 200066 were extracted and sequenced, and an average of 23,578,714 raw reads were generated. After removing low-quality reads, the average number of remaining clean reads was 23,523,435, and the average comparison rates of clean reads to the reference gene and reference genome were 80.54% and 96.69%, respectively. The statistics on the sequencing data for each sample is shown in Additional file 1: Table S7. Pair-wise differentially expressed gene (DEG) analyses revealed that more than 2000 DEGs, about one-fourth of the total genes in the genome, had significantly lower or higher transcript abundance (fold change (FC)\u2009>\u20092 and false discovery rate (FDR)\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) at each time points (12\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h) in NCPC 2\u201348 relative to CPCC 200066, as shown in Fig.\u00a02a. The transcriptional levels of some genes within the nvcm cluster were verified by RT-qPCR (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). The results of DEGs hierarchical clustering analysis showed that differential gene expression pattern was similar at 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a02b), more than two-thirds of the differential genes were up-regulated in the industrial strain. Interestingly, more genes were downregulated at 12\u00a0h compared to other two time points (Fig.\u00a02b), and there are 105 genes downregulated at 12\u00a0h but upregulated at 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h time points. KEGG pathway search showed that 35 out of these 105 genes are located in nvcm cluster. The biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites are usually activated in a growth phase-dependent manner, so that the genes responsible for secondary metabolism coincide with the onset of stationary phase in liquid fermentation in microorganisms. In the case of high-yield strain, transcriptional levels of genes responsible for biosynthesis of norvancomycin are lower in the early stage of growth (12\u00a0h), and then upregulated abruptly from 24 to 48\u00a0h, showing that the norvancomycin biosynthesis is more strictly controlled during the different growth stages. Due to the similarity of gene expression patterns between 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h, and most of DEGs included at 24\u00a0h (2,039 up-regulated and 628 down-regulated), we then analyzed the functional pathway enrichment of DEGs at 24\u00a0h based on KEGG database. Enrichment analysis of the functional categories of the transcriptome indicated that a total of 1,764 differential genes were annotated into 150 metabolic pathways, most of them related to the primary metabolism such as nitrogen metabolism and arginine biosynthesis, as well as the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as norvancomycin, tetracyclines and other type II polyketides, degradation of naphthalene and aromatic compounds, tyrosine and inositol phosphate metabolism processes.

It suggested that the positive feedback mechanism of AoStrR1 might be responsible for the significant upregulation of norvancomycin production in the industrial strain. Moreover, among the four StrR-family regulators discussed above, only AoStrR1 could bind to the upstream of vanY, part of the putative self-resistance genes. Given that self-resistance regulatory system VanRS is lack in nvcm cluster, it is tempting to speculate that AoStrR1 is somehow involved in the regulation of self-resistance.", "Conclusion", "Conclusion", "In this study, we compared the genomes of original norvancomycin producing strain CPCC 200066 and industrial strain A. orientalis NCPC 2\u201348. Three SVs and some InDels were found in the genome of high-yield strain compared with the original strain, and it is difficult to give a clear clue on its high-yield mechanism of norvancomycin. We further compared the transcriptomes of CPCC 200066 and NCPC 2-48 in three time points to identify differential expression genes involved in the production of norvancomycin. The results showed that the transcriptional upregulation of most nvcm biosynthetic genes and genes for precursor supply led to the high yield of norvancomycin in the industrial strain. Furthermore, two positive pathway-specific regulators of norvancomycin production were confirmed by overexpression of AoStrR1 and AoLuxR1. AoStrR1 positively regulates most nvcm genes by directly binding to multiple promoter regions in nvcm cluster. Thus, this study provides insights into the high yield mechanism and regulatory mechanism of norvancomycin in A. orientalis NCPC 2\u201348, which sets a foundation for future strain improvement.", "In this study, we compared the genomes of original norvancomycin producing strain CPCC 200066 and industrial strain A. orientalis NCPC 2\u201348.

A HisTrap\u2122 FF crude kit was used to purify recombinant protein, as described by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Fractions eluted from the column with 500\u00a0mM imidazole were passed through the PD-10 Desalting Columns (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009TGEK buffer (250\u00a0mM Tris, 50% Glycerol, 5\u00a0mM EDTA, 500\u00a0mM KCl, pH 8.0) at 4\u00a0\u2103, and then stored at \u2212 80\u00a0\u2103.
