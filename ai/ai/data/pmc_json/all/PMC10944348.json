["Academic Editor: Marta Laranjo", "The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, the decreased effectiveness of conventional therapies, and the side effects have led researchers to seek a safer, more cost-effective, patient-friendly, and effective method that does not develop antibiotic resistance. With progress in synthetic biology and genetic engineering, genetically engineered microorganisms effective in treatment, prophylaxis, drug delivery, and diagnosis have been developed. The present study reviews the types of genetically engineered bacteria and phages, their impacts on diseases, cancer, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders, the biosynthesis of these modified strains, the route of administration, and their effects on the environment. We conclude that genetically engineered microorganisms can be considered promising candidates for adjunctive treatment of diseases and cancers.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Since thousands of years ago, humans have turned to make changes in the characteristics of animals, plants, and microbes. The result of the changes is the creation of modified strains used in the food industry. The acquired success engaged researchers to develop more diverse genetic engineering techniques [1]. Genetic engineering, also known as genetic modification, is the process of using laboratory tools to change the nucleic acid sequence of an organism by removing or adding base pairs, inserting or inactivating an unnecessary virulence gene by creating a new characteristic in genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs). Formerly, humans made changes in microbes to produce foods such as bread and wine, while nowadays, genetic engineering of microbes has been used for industry and clinical applications. Among microbes, yeast and bacteria, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are most organisms undergoing chemical changes [2]. As genome sequencing and genetic techniques are developed and become powerful genomic tools, it is possible to make alterations in the gene sequence of phages and a wide range of bacterial strains to introduce new strains applied not only for the prevention or treatment of an infection but also for the diagnosis of it [3, 4]. Various mutations, transformation, conjugation, protoplast fusion, electroporation, recombination technology, and molecular genetics are commonly used in genetic engineering. In the past and before molecular genetics methods were invented, researchers used mutations induced by UV radiation and chemicals [5]. Through a combination of biotechnology and genetic engineering science, there are three gene-editing tools including zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) technology, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) technology, and clustered regularly spaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated (CRISPR-Cas) technology as first, second, and third generation technologies in recent years for gene editing by double-strand breaks in desired sequence of genes. The ZFNs and the TALEN are restriction endonuclease-based systems that show limitations such as inducing nonspecific mutations and are time-consuming, expensive, and nonspecific methods [6, 7], while the CRISPR technology is a more efficient and powerful editing method with more flexibility and simplicity [8].", "Since thousands of years ago, humans have turned to make changes in the characteristics of animals, plants, and microbes.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 10 million people will die from infections a year by 2050 [11]. One of the applications of GEMs is their potential activity against resistant to antibiotics bacterial pathogens. Two biochemists Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen developed the first GEM in 1973. They designed a new plasmid harboring antibiotic resistance gene and then transferred it to Escherichia coli (E. coli). The result showed that in vitro-produced antibiotic-resistance plasmid is active biologically and functionally in transformed E. coli [12].

Another application for GEM is seen in vaccinology. Vaccines are the main strategy for preventing most infectious diseases. When parts of the genome of pathogenic microorganisms are underchanged, the weakened nonpathogen strain is created. In addition, nonpathogenic bacteria can be changed by genetic engineering to express antigens on their surface, resulting in stimulation of the immune system.

GEMs Producing Technique and Tools", "2. GEMs Producing Technique and Tools", "There are different methods to modify microorganisms for their application in medicine, agriculture, and industry (Figure 1). In microbial genetic engineering, target genes are first sheared, spliced, and integrated using genetic operation tools before being inserted into chassis cells. Recombinant genes are therefore incorporated into the intended products or provide the bacterium with new phenotypes. The present study discusses novel and widely used methods of genetic engineering of bacteria and phages. Techniques used for the genetic manipulation of bacteria include CRISPR-Cas9, Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), phasmid transfection, phage infection, protoplast fusion, conjugate transfer, and transposition recombination [16]. Small gene fragments (<10\u2009kb) can be modified using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or restriction enzyme digestion and direct DNA synthesis [17], while recombination methods such as CRISPR-Cas9 and Red/ET are used for larger sizes (more than 50\u2009kb), which replace, remove, or add gene segments in plasmids or genomes. CRISPR-Cas9 can modify bacteria DNA pieces of up to 100\u2009kb [16]. \u201cCRISPR or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\u201d are short and partially palindromic repetitive DNA sequences found in the genomes of bacteria and other microorganisms used to perform targeted genome editing using the adaptive immune system of prokaryotes. CRISPR arrays are inserted into the genome of microorganisms through a process known as adaptation. As a critical component of the immune system, they protect the health of organisms. CRISPR-Cas systems offer microorganisms RNA-directed adaptive protection against invading genetic elements by instructing nucleases to bind and cleave specific nucleic acid sequences [1, 18, 19]. CRISPR-Cas consists of a simple two-component system used for targeted gene editing. The first component of this system is the single-agent Cas9 protein with endonuclease properties, which contains RuvC and HNH domains and is responsible for separating DNA strands. The second component of gene editing is a single guide RNA (sgRNA) carrying a scaffold sequence, which allows it to anchor to Cas9 and place the spacer of 20 complementary pairs of the target gene in the vicinity of the PAM, thus directing the Cas9 protein toward the target gene. Finally, by inserting the CRISPR/Cas9 complex into the cell, double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the target genomic site are created [2]. After recognition and cutting, DNA repair and editing are carried out through cellular mechanisms of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway. NHEJ is a common error-prone method involving the random insertion-deletion of base pairs (Indel) at the cleavage site. This mechanism typically leads to frameshift mutations, a premature stop codon, and/or the formation of a nonfunctional polypeptide. This method has potential use in genetic deletion experiments, gene disruption therapy, and CRISPR genomic functional screening. HDR is an error-free repair mechanism that uses the homologous section of the unedited DNA strand as a template to repair the damaged DNA, resulting in error-free repair. This method is particularly appealing for clinical applications. In general, this method allows researchers to examine the function of genes to find novel applications in medicine and biotechnology, in addition to precise and efficient modification of bacterial genome [1, 3]. To incorporate foreign DNA segments into the bacterial genome, homologous recombination and transposition are also accessible [1]. When selection markers or CRISPR editing alleles are not available, transposition is the best way to integrate target genes into the bacterial genome [4, 5]. So far, the most often employed transposases are Tol2 [6], Tn7 [7], Tn5 [8], ICEBs1 [9], and sleeping beauty, piggyBac [10], which can integrate very small or large DNA pieces into the genomes of bacteria.

Electroporation and heat shock transfection are common methods for plasmid transfer in Salmonella, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, B. thuringiensis, and other bacteria. Plasmids are often transferred from donor bacteria to recipient bacteria via conjugative transfer and protoplast fusion [2].

Furthermore, homologous recombination technologies, namely, homologous recombination, site-specific recombination, recombination, and the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, allow for the direct insertion of desired genes into the host genome in a predictable strain. Typical homologous recombination techniques need more than 1\u2009kb homologous sequences to achieve target gene recombination into the chromosomal genome [4]. Nevertheless, the plasmid capacity for carrying and transposition techniques do not permit the operation of big DNA fragments, particularly those greater than 100\u2009kb [5].

(1) In infected cells, wild-type genomes can recombine using a DNA-editing template. (2) Smaller fragments assemble to form a larger synthetic fragment and then reactivate to generate progeny [12]. A natural biological process known as homologous recombination involves the exchange of nucleotide sequences between two DNA molecules with similar or identical sequences. It was applied in the first generation of phage genome engineering techniques. Parental phages with different phenotypes were coinfected with host cells through the process named phage crosses, and then recombination occurred between the genomes of two phages. Finally, the progeny phages were screened for wanted phenotypes. Recombinants with the right phenotypes were then isolated for further investigation [13, 14]. Phage crosses can only combine existing phage genomes and need markers and phenotypes to determine recombinant phages [24]. To address this limitation, donor plasmids were utilized for insertions, deletions, and replacement of nucleotides in the phage genome. A plasmid with a planned mutation flanked by homologous phage sequences is developed and introduced into a bacterial host and subsequently infected with the phage [13]. Notably, the low frequency of recombination in homologous recombination and the need for processes for screening phages with the desired phenotype are two limitations of this approach [27]. Recombineering is a technique for increasing recombination efficiency by using temperate phage native recombination mechanisms that require the production of phage recombination proteins such as Rac RecE/RecT and lambda Red within the recombination host, which protects the editing template from degrading and facilitates annealing with the injected phage genome [26, 27]. The bacteriophage recombineering of electroporated DNA (BRED) method needs coelectroporation of the donor DNA and phage DNA template into bacterial cells that express RecE/RecT-like proteins through plasmid or chromosomally inserted genes [26, 28, 29]. The donor DNA has the necessary mutations flanked by engineered phage homologous sequences, which causes the phage genome and donor DNA to recombine in a homologous manner. So, recombination only occurs once phage genome replication has started. As a result, both wild-type and mutant phages would be recovered and found in the produced plaques [13, 28]. In conclusion, recombineering-based approaches have the potential to be used in a variety of bacterial species and allow precise mutation of phage genomes at a significantly better rate than standard homologous recombination [30]. Another method based on recombination is the \u201cCRISPR-Cas strategy\u201d which is also harnessed for genome engineering purposes in phages [13, 31]. Cas9 protein, crRNA, and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), the three parts of the CRISPR-Cas system, are often cloned onto a single plasmid. The crRNA and tracrRNA can either be expressed individually or as a single fusion RNA [32\u201334]. Once these components are transformed into the host cells, they form a CRISPR-Cas9 complex which binds specifically to the target site in the phage genome during phage infection, resulting in the creation of a double-strand DNA break. In bacteria, the lack or low efficiency of NHEJ repairing systems makes the cleavage of the CRISPR-Cas9 complex usually lethal to the phage. This is why it is common for the DNA break to be repaired by recombination with the donor to generate mutants of interest when the homologous donor is provided. Therefore, the CRISPR-Cas system is a powerful tool for the precise editing of genomes, as it can target specific genes or regions and induce the desired mutations [13, 34\u201336]. The \u201crebooting method\u201d is another phage engineering strategy. The acquisition of active virion from the phage genome is referred to as phage rebooting. Synthetic approaches for genome assembly outside of natural bacterial hosts have been developed to address the issue that phage gene products may be hazardous to their bacterial hosts. These methods depend on the transformation of small to medium-sized fragments of DNA into complete phage genomes via transformation-associated recombination (TAR) or in vitro enzymatic assembly (Gibson assembly) [27, 37, 38]. The synthesized phage genome can be reactivated by transforming into suitable host cells, L-forms, and cell-free expression systems [30]. In the TAR technique, several large DNA segments recombine in yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC) [33]. Researchers have altered and rebooted several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial phages, including Klebsiella phage K11, E. coli phages T3 and T7, P. aeruginosa phages, and Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) phage P35, based on the assembling and capturing of synthetic genomes into YAC [37, 39\u201341]. Gram-positive bacteria often have low transformation efficiency. A recent study found that employing L-form bacteria efficiently reboots phages of Gram-positive bacteria. L-form bacteria do not have a cell wall and, unlike their parent cells, can take in enormous amounts of DNA such as phage genome DNA. It was demonstrated that L-form Listeria may be used not only to reboot Listeria phages but also to reboot Staphylococcus and Bacillus phages [13, 40].", "As shown in Figure 1, there are two general strategies for creating engineered phages.

The synthesized phage genome can be reactivated by transforming into suitable host cells, L-forms, and cell-free expression systems [30]. In the TAR technique, several large DNA segments recombine in yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC) [33]. Researchers have altered and rebooted several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial phages, including Klebsiella phage K11, E. coli phages T3 and T7, P. aeruginosa phages, and Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) phage P35, based on the assembling and capturing of synthetic genomes into YAC [37, 39\u201341]. Gram-positive bacteria often have low transformation efficiency. A recent study found that employing L-form bacteria efficiently reboots phages of Gram-positive bacteria. L-form bacteria do not have a cell wall and, unlike their parent cells, can take in enormous amounts of DNA such as phage genome DNA. It was demonstrated that L-form Listeria may be used not only to reboot Listeria phages but also to reboot Staphylococcus and Bacillus phages [13, 40].", "New synthetic biology approaches for rebooting phage genomes outside of host cells remove the necessity for DNA transformation and allow to produce phages that infect unfamiliar or undescribed hosts. Using cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) methods, high yields of self-assembling T4, T7, MS2, and FX174 phage particles were synthesized in a test tube using optimized E. coli extracts and a modest amount of phage DNA. Although previous genetic engineering was limited to phages infecting extensively studied lab hosts, the recent development of cell-free systems from more bacteria is expected to expand future phage engineering to novel bacterial hosts such as Streptomyces, Vibrio, Pseudomonas, and Bacillus species [27, 42\u201345].", "New synthetic biology approaches for rebooting phage genomes outside of host cells remove the necessity for DNA transformation and allow to produce phages that infect unfamiliar or undescribed hosts.

Recently, oncolytic viral therapy has been identified as a potentially effective new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer. A naturally occurring or genetically modified virus that may selectively reproduce in cancer cells and destroy them without endangering healthy tissues is known as an oncolytic virus [57].

Genetically Modified (GM) Phages", "3. Genetically Modified (GM) Phages", "Bacteriophages have been effective in the treatment of bacterial infections [61, 62]. Phages are known by unique features including specificity, narrow mode of action, safety and tolerability, easy administration, selectivity, and less expense. These characteristics make phages to be considered as alternative therapy for treatment of bacterial infection [63]. There are limitations described for phage therapy such as specific target, narrow spectrum action of phages than antibiotics [64], and issues related to the formulation and stability of phages as a pharmaceutical agent. There is not enough information about the biology of phages, highlighting a need for extensive studies in this regard [65, 66]. One of the strategies to overcome limitations is to create novel GM phages with therapeutic capabilities by engineering technology like GMPs [64] mediating modification and restoration of the gut microbiome. The human gut microbiome comprised of bacteria, viruses, and archaea plays an important role in both human health and disease states [63, 67]. Dysbiosis and imbalance in the microbial composition of the gut microbiota are related to diseases like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), coeliac disease, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and asthma [68]. Using phages to restore this imbalance is considered a promising therapeutic method. Hu et al. treated a germ-free mouse with lytic phages to colonization with commensal gut bacteria. They found the phages destroyed the sensitive strains in the gut, while 68% Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) became resistant to the phages in follow-up [69]. In spite of the major therapeutic potential of natural phages, bacteria can become resistant to phages and the immune system can trigger against phages. Companies tend to develop GM phages through specific techniques like the CRISPR-Cas system for therapeutic purposes targeting pathogenic bacterial strains and eukaryotic cells(Table 1), increasing the susceptibility of resistant bacteria to antibiotics, increasing the host range of phages, and establishing homeostasis in the microbiota [63, 85]. CRISPR-Cas is used for the development of GM phages by targeting and removing undesirable genes like antibiotic-resistant genes. The engineered M13 phage targets bacteria carrying the beta-lactam-resistant gene, leading to a reduction in the number of living bacteria cells. Similarly, a reduction in the number of living bacterial cells was observed when fluoroquinolones-resistant E. coli strains harboring a gyr A mutation were treated with CRISPR-GM phage [86]. The limited host spectrum of phages results in advantages and disadvantages. Since treatment with a single phage would not be effective in multimicrobial diseases [87], preparing a phage cocktail and phage engineering are considered strategies to increase the host range of bacteriophages [88]. The host spectrum of the phage can be expanded using targeted mutagenesis in the tail fiber regions involved in determining the phage host [63, 89]. One of the reasons for persistent infections is bacterial biofilm formation on healthcare devices. The extracellular matrix of biofilms acts as a shield to prevent antibiotic penetration into the biofilm. Some of the GM phages carry enzymes to destroy this matrix and consequently facilitate the penetration of antibiotics into the biofilm [90]. Besides, GM phages are used as drug carriers to treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and cancer [63]. Bar et al. investigated the impacts of hygromycin-conjugated GM phages on human breast adenocarcinoma in SKBR3 cell line. They reported that hygromycin had a better effect by 1000-fold, compared with conventional drugs [91]. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) acts as a hurdle against access to therapeutic peptides, antibiotics, and chemotherapy agents. Using the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d strategy, phages have successfully carried drugs across the BBB. In a study conducted by Anand et al., Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) bacteriophage P22 was genetically engineered to express a peptide on its capsid that enables the phage to pass through the BBB. Results of this showed that the Ziconotide peptide is well expressed in snail venom and has analgesic properties [92]. Shiga-like toxin produced by EHEC causes inflammation in the intestine, resulting in an increase in proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 as well as IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA levels due to the activation of the immune system. Therefore, following the use of the engineered \u03bb phase, IL-6, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA levels in the serum are significantly reduced [93]. Recently, a case report of Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus) was analyzed in a 15-year-old cystic fibrosis patient with an engineered cocktail of three phages. Lytic derivatives effectively killing M. abscessus were developed in ZoeJ phage through genetic engineering by the BRED method. Intravenous phage therapy was well tolerated and linked to clinical symptom improvements such as sternal wound healing, better liver function, and significant clearance of infected skin nodules [94]. Moreover, engineered phages have the ability to degrade biofilm exopolysaccharide. Through genetic engineering, T7 and Y2 phages express two genes, dispersin B (dspB) and amylovoran depolymerase (dpoL1), encoding exopolysaccharide-degrading enzymes, thereby increasing cell lysis inside the biofilm [64]. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) as one of the important nosocomial pathogens causes high mortality and morbidity rates. The current treatment for C. difficile infection is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics; although the treatment is successful, recurrence occurs in 30% of cases. Since no lytic phage is known for C. difficile, the lysogenic phage is considered to target Clostridium by using the bacteria's own CRISPR system for degradation of the bacterial genome. C. difficile CD24-2 phage has been engineered to deliver the type I-BCRISPR-Cas system of C. difficile. The phage can target C. difficile by using the bacteria's own CRISPR system to degrade the bacterial genome. Bacterial death occurs simultaneously through bacterial genome degradation by CRISPR-Cas system and the expression of lytic genes of bacteriophage, holin, and endolysin [95].", "Bacteriophages have been effective in the treatment of bacterial infections [61, 62].

In the diabetic animal model designed by Duan et al., GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) was expressed in Lactobacillus gasseri (L. gasseri). In diabetic rats receiving orally engineered L. gasseri,insulin-producing cells were produced in sufficient quantity and the normal function of insulin-producing cells was no longer disturbed [167]. Other Lactobacilli spp. were also subjected to genetic modifications including Lactobacillus lactis (L. lactis) and Lactobacillus casei (L. casei). In vitro studies of L. lactis were designed to deliver therapeutic proteins like antienterococcal peptides, hiracin JM79, enterocin A and enterocin P, SCI-59, and flagellin, which showed to be effective in the treatment of E. faecalis infection, diabetes, and enteropathogen infection, respectively [168\u2013170]. Enterococci were not able to grow and survive in the presence of engineered L. lactis producing antienterococcal peptides [168]. IBD is influenced by engineered L. lactis and L. casei genetically modified to deliver Elafin. Elafin is a type of protease inhibitor involved in protecting gastrointestinal surfaces against any damage. According to the result of the examination of the cell line and mouse model, both probiotics colonize in the intestine and successfully produce Elafin [171]. Rosberg et al. designed a recombinant Lactobacillus paracasei (L. paracasei) to produce linoleic acid isomerase which has a role in fatty acid accumulation. Histological examination of liver tissue in mice model showed higher levels of cis-12 and trans-12 which are directly associated with successful expression of linoleic acid isomerase encoding gene in engineered L. paracasei [172]. In the same study by Koo et al., L. paracasei underwent genetic manipulation against L. monocytogenes infection. Recombinant L. paracasei which expressed Listeria's adhesion protein showed significant decreases in invasion and attachment of L. monocytogenes in cell line experiment [173]. In another report, Lactobacillus jensenii (L. jensenii) showed an in vitro anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) effect following genetic modification to secret CV-N, a HIV-1 entry inhibitor cyanovirin-N. L. jensenii expressing antiviral peptide reduces the infection in further examination on animal model [174], and there are no inflammation and potential adverse effects following colonization of recombinant L. jensenii. Also, modified L. casei expressing Listeria's adhesins was able to colonize the intestine and compete with Listeria to reduce infection caused by Listeria. They mediate the immune system by increasing regulatory and natural killer cells [175]. Bifidobacterium spp. are Gram-positive bacillus of obligate anaerobes resident in the gastrointestinal system such as the intestines of mammals. So far, ten types of Bifidobacterium spp. have been introduced in humans. These bacteria well colonize the tumor region and survive, suggesting Bifidobacterium spp. as a promising candidate in cancer therapy [176]. Several studies highlighted the gene delivery by bifidobacteria in the treatment of cancer. Wang et al. designed an engineered Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve) strain by electrotransformation of IL-24 gene which was expressed on the probiotic surface. Inhibitory effects on tumor progression were observed by analyzing tumor growth and apoptosis induction, which indicates recombinant B. breve-IL24 is a promising strategy in cancer therapy [177]. Wei et al. performed an experiment on the mouse model with colitis by transfer of Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) delivering rhMnSOD (recombinant human manganese superoxide dismutase) to colitis mouse model [178].

Genetically engineered E. coli Nissle (EcN) has shown its beneficial effects in both infections and diseases. Duan et al. used engineered E. coli Nissle expressing CAI-1 in a mouse model suffering from Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) infection. They found that the binding rate of toxin to the intestine of mice and the number of V. cholerae decreased by 80% and 69%, respectively [134]. In the same study by Hwang et al., modified E. coli Nissle was used producing S5 pyocin, E7 lysis protein, and DspB to protect the mice model against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection [85]. They successfully reported that engineered E. coli Nissle is a suitable probiotic candidate for treatment and prophylaxis against bacterial infection induced by photogenic Pseudomonas. Genetically engineered E. coli Nissle harboring HIV-gp41-hemolysin was examined for HIV infection [145]. Colon histological examination and the immunocytochemistry (ICC) analysis indicate successful colonization of colorectum by modified E. coli Nissle in a murine model for months while expressing antiviral peptides. This result makes E. coli Nissle the first promising live antiviral probiotic against HIV infection. In addition to microbial infection, disorders can also be alleviated by genetically engineered probiotics. Engineered E. coli Nissle was investigated for delivery of fructose dehydrogenase and mannitol-2-dehydrogenase enzymes to examine hepatic steatosis disorder in rats [179]. Following administration of engineered E. coli Nissle, lipid peroxidation reduced significantly while the serum and hepatic antioxidant enzyme levels were increased. Therefore, engineered E. coli Nissle also confer a good probiotic strain in the treatment of metabolic disorders. Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) undergoing genetic modification by Chen et al. to prevent Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) can successfully neutralize C. difficile toxins by secreting a protein called ABAB.

Duan et al. used engineered E. coli Nissle expressing CAI-1 in a mouse model suffering from Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) infection. They found that the binding rate of toxin to the intestine of mice and the number of V. cholerae decreased by 80% and 69%, respectively [134]. In the same study by Hwang et al., modified E. coli Nissle was used producing S5 pyocin, E7 lysis protein, and DspB to protect the mice model against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection [85]. They successfully reported that engineered E. coli Nissle is a suitable probiotic candidate for treatment and prophylaxis against bacterial infection induced by photogenic Pseudomonas. Genetically engineered E. coli Nissle harboring HIV-gp41-hemolysin was examined for HIV infection [145]. Colon histological examination and the immunocytochemistry (ICC) analysis indicate successful colonization of colorectum by modified E. coli Nissle in a murine model for months while expressing antiviral peptides. This result makes E. coli Nissle the first promising live antiviral probiotic against HIV infection. In addition to microbial infection, disorders can also be alleviated by genetically engineered probiotics. Engineered E. coli Nissle was investigated for delivery of fructose dehydrogenase and mannitol-2-dehydrogenase enzymes to examine hepatic steatosis disorder in rats [179]. Following administration of engineered E. coli Nissle, lipid peroxidation reduced significantly while the serum and hepatic antioxidant enzyme levels were increased. Therefore, engineered E. coli Nissle also confer a good probiotic strain in the treatment of metabolic disorders. Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) undergoing genetic modification by Chen et al. to prevent Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) can successfully neutralize C. difficile toxins by secreting a protein called ABAB.

The results from phagebodies showed that they turn out to have a wide range of bacterial hosts that can inhibit bacterial growth for a longer period of time [207].", "Although phages without genetic changes are capable of fighting antibiotic-resistant microbial infections [42], using genetic engineering to modify phage can develop phages with specific abilities, for instance, usually, the phage is designed to target a wider range of bacterial strains. The advantage of this strategy is to use fewer phages in the cocktails, reduce the preparation and purification proceeding of a large amount of phage, and reduce the rate of development of bacterial resistance following synthetic biology [35].

However, the limitations like the lack of effect on whole region of tumor with anaerobic conditions have led to developing novel treatments based on the transfer of cancer and anticancer antigens or drugs through vectors. As the science of genetic engineering advances, researchers have turned their attention to target tumors using genetically engineered bacteria. There are several types of anaerobic bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Clostridium, E. coli, and Bifidobacterium known as live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) that are able to survive in the tumor site due to their anaerobic nature and adaption to hypoxic condition. They would have many benefits for cancer treatment by their ability to spread and carry the drug, anticancer compounds, proteins, and pre-enzymes to the anaerobic space of the cancer mass [122]. They have many potential benefits for cancer treatment related to their ability to spread and to transfer and release drug or anticancer compounds to anaerobic space of the cancer mass [122, 216]. Following genetic modification of the bacteria to harbor genes and proteins, colonization in tumor site occurred, resulting in not only transfer of antigens or cancer-fighting compounds but also stimulation of the immune response [109, 110, 217, 218]. Moreover, E. coli Nissle 1917 can be designed as a targeted transporter to deliver cancer antigens or effective proteins such as p53 and nano-antibodies to the anaerobic areas of the tumor [113]. Selection of an antitumor substance mostly depends on the biogenesis of tumor. For instance, given that amino acid L-arginine is considered as an effective factor in the development of the immune response against tumors, genetic engineering of strains to produce more L-arginine would have a significant effect in preventing cancer. Bacteria-based cancer therapy is the matter that has risen for years [114]. Moreover, probiotics have been considered for their anticancer effects excreting through inducing apoptosis and preventing oxidative stress [159, 160]. As shown in Table 1, it became possible to design new probiotics to fight cancer by genetic technology [109] from which only two genetically engineered probiotics entered clinical phases for treatment of cancers. First, E. coli Nissle 1917 was engineered to produce cyclic di-AMP which activates the immune response and the antigen presenting cells (APCs) by affecting on the sequence of interferon [161]. This engineered strain known as SYNB1891 (NCT04167137) currently is under investigation in phase 1 clinical trial.

There is hope that bacTRL-IL-12 will be able to stimulate antitumor immune response. The size and volume of the tumor usually calculated after every cancer therapy were reduced after the use of the genetically engineered strains.

Also, GEM is used as a new method in the treatment of many diseases especially inflammatory diseases [222]. Engineered L. lactis strains were designed by Steidler et al. to produce IL-10 as an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Results of their study showed 50% reduction in colitis symptoms in murine chronic colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). In addition to being cost-effective, this treatment method also causes localized delivery and an active synthesis in situ. Besides, the dose required in this condition is lower than the dose required for systemic treatment. So, this strategy might represent a better way for the long-term and cost-effective management of IBD in patients [174, 175]. In a placebo-uncontrolled study, the thymidylate synthase gene of L. lactis was replaced by the IL-10 gene to treat Crohn's disease patients. Treatment with this modified bacterium (LL-Thy12) alleviated the disease with the minimum side effects. It was demonstrated that employing genetically engineered bacteria for protein delivery to the mucosa is an appropriate approach in humans. As a result, it could be useful as a maintenance therapy for chronic intestinal illness [200]. Engineered Bifidobacterium spp., B. longum, also have been developed for the treatment of IBD to deliver \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) exhibiting an anti-inflammatory effect on the intestine. Well intestinal colonization with engineered B. longum and significant anti-inflammatory effects by high \u03b1-MSH expression were observed in rat model of ulcerative colitis. Actually, this engineered bacterium reduces IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, nitric oxide (NO), and myeloperoxidase enzyme from which all are proinflammatory factors in ulcerative colitis and also increases IL-10 as an anti-inflammatory cytokine [174, 223]. Another strategy used in the treatment of colitis is the expression of enzymes with antioxidant properties. For instance, Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) strains genetically modified by a plasmid to express catalase and superoxide dismutase were able to reduce colitis in a mouse model by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. So, these findings suggest that genetically altering a bacterium candidate with inherent immunomodulatory capabilities (e.g., S. thermophilus CRL 807) by inserting a gene encoding an antioxidant enzyme improves its anti-inflammatory effects to express catalase and superoxide dismutase and is able to reduce colitis in a murine model [177]. Neutralization of IL-6, as another important cytokine in the pathology of IBD, can be found as an effective treatment method. According to this statement, L. lactis strains expressing anti-IL-6 affibody has been engineered by fusion and expression of IL-6 on the surface of the probiotic with Usp45 (secretion peptide) and AcmA (anchoring protein). Findings of the investigation showed that this anti-IL-6 affibody can strongly remove human IL-6. The elimination was highly selective for IL-6, with no cross-reactivity for other proinflammatory cytokines linked to IBD pathogenesis. Because lactic acid bacteria survive in the gastrointestinal tract, they are appropriate for oral administration, enabling them for local delivery of cytokine blockers to the gut. Oral administration allows for direct contact with irritated mucosa, allowing medications to be delivered close to reactive cells.

The study showed that using genetic engineering to target the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 receptor (TNFR1) can be a suitable option for the treatment of Crohn's disease induced by an increase in the expression of the inflammatory cytokine (TNF-\u03b1). Hydrostatin-SN1 (H-SN1) peptide in the T7 phage library obtained from the venom of the snake Hydrophis cyanocinctus (H. cyanocinctus) by cloning system exhibits its anti-inflammatory effects through targeting TNFR and preventing the binding of TNF-\u03b1 to TNFR in a murine model, resulting in alleviation of colitis symptoms. It has been shown that in vitro, H-SN1 decreases TNF-\u03b1 toxicity as well as the activation of TNFR-related signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u043aB) [62].

Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity induced by changes in lifestyle, consuming unhealthy foods, etc. are the most common metabolic disorders [179, 180]. These diseases are difficult to treat and need long-term changes in diet and lifestyle patterns which impose a significant economic burden on patients [109]. Given that altered composition of the gut microbiome is another leading cause of these disorders, microbiome restoration is a helpful factor in their treatment. A new strategy for the modification of the gut microbiota could be use of modified microorganisms expressing and/or secreting therapeutic compounds [180]. In addition to targeted drug delivery, engineered bacteria as therapeutic agents can also help to restore homeostasis within a disturbed microbial population [230].", "Metabolism of substances in the healthy person is relatively stable in a normal state but sometimes chemical processes due to abnormalities in the host's metabolism enzymes can lead to accumulation or even deficiency in these metabolites and consequently induction of disease [85, 134, 228, 229].

The treatment of type I and type II diabetes became possible through the genetic modification of bacteria to improve production of insulin from host cells.

GEMs for Infections", "9.4. GEMs for Infections", "9.4. GEMs for Infections", "Bacteria are undergoing genetically modifying technology based on their special characteristics. They can be designed to express specific biomacromolecules on their surface and are able to be used for the treatment of microbial infections [140, 240, 247]. Moreover, bacterial antibiotic resistance is increasing through excessive misuse of antibiotics which is directly related to an increase in death rate. Therefore, finding more effective alternative ways for treating infection and overcoming resistance is important [248, 249]. One of the strategies to combat infections using modified microorganisms is identifying internal and external QS signals secreted by pathogenic organisms and responding to them by the production of antimicrobial compounds and interference of QS mechanisms followed by suppression of virulence genes through alternative QS signals. QS refers to the bacterial interaction with one another or between species to coordinate cellular function [197, 250]. This process entails the identification of signaling molecules known as autoinducers (AIs). Spore formation, invasion of pathogens, bioluminescence, and population control are examples of QS-based phenotypic characteristics in bacteria [251]. Numerous studies were conducted to control the expression of pathogenic virulence genes and the production of antimicrobial compounds by analyzing biological systems and guiding their design based on QS. Commensal E. coli strains were genetically modified to recognize the signals of wild-type of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) and produce bacteriocin. This bacteriocin-producing probiotic expressing LasR was modified under the control of luxR promoter and E7 protein lysis to enhance the release of bacteriocin. P. aeruginosa growth and biofilm formation were reduced by 99% and 90%, respectively, when P. aeruginosa and recombinant E. coli were cultured [252, 253].

Since phages are promising therapeutic options due to their special features, such as the ability to be self-replicating and self-limiting, the usage of phage cocktails, and the possibility of modification of phages [262], phage engineering was introduced in genetic engineering by mutation, genetic replacement, and the integration of a foreign gene to increase the antibacterial spectrum effect of phage [249, 263]. Engineered \u03bb phage inhibited the growth of Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) both in vivo and in vitro. A CRISPR-Cas-3 system and several CRISPR spacers targeting EHEC are embedded in the wild-type \u03bb phage. In fact, this CRISPR-Cas-3 system has been engineered to increase the specificity of this phage so that its lytic gene, cro, has been knocked out. The results of studying in mice model showed that GM \u03bb phage reduces the number of bacteria to an undetectable level and not only rescues the mice but also restores the gut microbiota of the mice [264].", "10. Routes of Administration for Engineered Microorganisms", "10. Routes of Administration for Engineered Microorganisms", "The administration of genetically engineered microorganisms depends on factors such as the type of disease, the involved target tissue, and especially the pathogenic potential of the selected microorganism. Subcutaneous injection, intravenous, intratumoral, nasal, and oral administration methods have been defined for the transfer and administration of genetically engineered microorganisms [265]. Intravenous administration is exclusively utilized for transferring genetically engineered microorganisms in cancer treatment due to its high potential for systemic circulation [266]. In addition, intratumoral administration is also suggested for cancer therapy. In this method, the toxicity caused by the transfer of genetically engineered microorganisms is greatly reduced. These microorganisms multiply locally in the tumor site, so they stimulate the immune response, and the process of cell apoptosis is also started. However, this method faces probable complications such as inciting inflammation, cytokine storm, and the dangers of rapid cell death for other organs [267\u2013269]. Nasal administration has been more successful in the administration of intranasal vaccines due to the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses both in the area of entry and the surrounding related areas [270]. In bacteriotherapy, oral administration is the most widely used administration method due to the fact that it is easier to perform and noninvasive, which leads to more acceptance by patients. However, the passage of genetically engineered microbes through the gastrointestinal system has always been criticized because the gastrointestinal system faces many challenges, such as diversity and differences in the microbial flora, the level of acidity (range of pH 1.0\u20137.4), and the percentage of oxygen (stomach, small intestine, and colon) [271\u2013273]. During oral administration, approximately half of the genetically engineered microbes are lost due to the challenges mentioned earlier. Considering that these modified microbes need to be transferred intact and alive to the target tissue or organ in order to exert their optimal effects, loading them into carriers and covering them with lipid, polysaccharide, cationic nano-liposomes, and alginate helps protect them during the oral route of administration [27]. By comparison of these methods, blood and nasal administration of genetically engineered microbes may be more effective than oral due to their fast reaching to the target sites [269]. On the other hand, oral administration is much better than intranasal administration because it induces a wide immune response [274]. The difference in these results originates from the examination of different diseases, for example, allergic disease is more affected by oral administration than intravenous administration [275].", "The administration of genetically engineered microorganisms depends on factors such as the type of disease, the involved target tissue, and especially the pathogenic potential of the selected microorganism.

Assessment of Safety for the Environment", "The usage and release of GEMs into the environment, typically agriculture, is expanding exponentially. GEMs' potential uses include mining and mineral recovery, crop production, and insect management [28]. This technique can also favor other components of agricultural emissions, such as lowering the use of energy and fossil fuels and permitting decreased tillage and no-tillage farming methods, in addition to decreasing emissions from changing land cover and early pesticide usage [291]. Furthermore, it might be a powerful tool for the broader conservation of biodiversity. According to projections, between 15 and 40 percent of species might become extinct by 2050, mostly due to habitat loss and altered conditions brought on by climate change, so it requires more attention in this field [30]. In the recent era, the increased persistence of hazardous contaminants is having a negative impact on the world in a variety of ways [31]. Compared to other physicochemical approaches, utilizing microbial metabolic abilities for the degradation/removal of environmental contaminants provides an economical and safe alternative [32]. Despite the many advantages of GEMs in bioremediation and despite many regulations to prevent them from harming the environment, environmental concerns and legal issues related to the release/use of GEMs have limited their use [33\u201335]. It is very challenging to define the environmental risk associated with the intentional release of GEMs in a clear and concise manner. Several definitions have been put forth; the term \u201cecosystem perturbation\u201d may be the most nebulous since it can refer to almost any possible outcome (e.g., disturbance of ecological processes such as soil respiration, nitrification, or denitrification) [36]. One of the environmental concerns with GMOs is the potential spread of introduced traits to wild populations. This could occur through cross-pollination of genetically engineered (GE) crops with wild relatives, or through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mechanisms. The former is very unlikely in most cases because commercially grown crops are usually genetically distant from their wild neighbors, but it has been observed. Some current regulations and practices aim to reduce the frequency of these occurrences [292]. The latter appears to be extremely rare in eukaryotes, according to Keese [38]. It is shown in this regard that many species of microalgae studied for biofuel production can invade ecosystems due to their small size, rapid growth, and large numbers, causing environmental concerns such as competition, habitat alteration, horizontal gene transfer, and toxicity. Among other major concerns about the spread of GEMs use are the risks related to the persistence of unwanted genes, the transfer of GEMs to native species, and uncontrolled propagation, especially when they are to be widely distributed [39, 293]. The serious consequences of vertical gene transfer between GMOs and their wild-type counterparts were shown in studies involving transgenic fish released into natural populations of the same species. The genetically altered fish's enhanced capacity for reproduction led to a reduction in the survivability of their offspring [40]. Furthermore, to prevent the introduction of unwanted genetic features and make the behavior of a GEM more predictable, the capacity of GEMs to disseminate new genetic information to potential recipients must be restricted. Also, in order to prevent GEMs from spreading and having an adverse effect on the native population of organisms, their survival must be restricted in both time and space, or through the establishment of a controlled life cycle (biological confinement) [39]. For instance, during a study, it was stated that the growth of monarch butterflies by consuming pollinated leaves from genetically modified corn is slowed down and the chance of their death increases because GM crops reduce the number of insects that provide food for birds and other wildlife, and from this it harms biodiversity [41]. Genetically modified foods and the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes to gut flora can expose people to new allergies [40]. For example, Seralini et al.'s study revealed that rats fed transgenic NK-603 Roundup Ready maize had higher tumor incidence, chronic kidney disease, liver congestion, necrosis, and higher female mortality [42]. In addition to putting human health at risk, horizontal gene transfer of pesticide, herbicide, or antibiotic resistance to other species will upset ecological balances by enabling previously innocuous plants to proliferate unrestrained and so boosting the spread of pathogens between plants and animals [43]. Additionally, recent research has demonstrated that probiotics can evolve undesirable traits during treatment or diagnosis including acquiring harmful functions such as competitive elimination of native microbes, pathogenic potential against host or environment, or loss of beneficial functions of the engineered system; therefore, biocontrol strategies preventing or minimizing the entry or any penetration of GMOs into the environment are needed [44, 45, 260, 294\u2013296]. Although we may not be able to accurately predict the interaction of each genetically engineered microorganism with the environment, several biocontainment strategies of various degrees of efficiency and stability have been developed such as the use of auxotrophy and synthetic amino acids. Auxotrophy is the elimination of the ability of an organism to synthesize a vital compound that it must receive from its growth medium or its environment and can help to inhibit microorganism in the laboratory environment. These vital compounds include somethings essential for cell survival or those needed in high concentrations which cause the maximum effectiveness of this method [250, 297\u2013299]. Notably, inducible systems or auxotrophy does not address the potential risk of genetic information escape, i.e., horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, the limitation of this method is that they may require additional survival factors and supplemental probiotic media [197, 251]. Cellular circuits contain lethal switches, as well as addiction modules, all of which achieve inhibition by binding cells to a specific compound (or lack thereof) or genetic information, and thus lethal components are expressed in response to environmental signals and finally cause cell death in response to an inducing chemical. Control of cell survival is done through expression of lysis proteins and destruction of essential proteins and toxins. For example, in E. coli, the \u201cbioretention circuits\u201d included temperature sensors to differentiate between physiological and environmental temperatures [150, 251\u2013253, 300, 301]. Another solution for intoxicating GMOs in environment is toxin-antitoxin systems consisting of stable and unstable toxins. To prevent the transfer of genetic information in the horizontal gene transfer, toxin and antitoxin systems can be placed in different parts of the cell's genetic repository. For example, the toxin is placed on the plasmid and the antitoxin on the chromosome; therefore, during horizontal gene transfer, the plasmid that does not carry the antitoxin will kill the new host [257]. Understanding how to evaluate the impact on biodiversity is necessary for this technology to be accepted despite its many positive effects on the environment and economy. The assessment of future genetically modified organisms' effects on biodiversity requires ongoing updates to this knowledge (https://www.government.nl/topics/biotechnology/consequences-of-gmos-for-biodiversity). Due to their inherent properties in degradability, they are eliminated by themselves in the body and will not have side effects or will be less.

The former is very unlikely in most cases because commercially grown crops are usually genetically distant from their wild neighbors, but it has been observed. Some current regulations and practices aim to reduce the frequency of these occurrences [292]. The latter appears to be extremely rare in eukaryotes, according to Keese [38]. It is shown in this regard that many species of microalgae studied for biofuel production can invade ecosystems due to their small size, rapid growth, and large numbers, causing environmental concerns such as competition, habitat alteration, horizontal gene transfer, and toxicity. Among other major concerns about the spread of GEMs use are the risks related to the persistence of unwanted genes, the transfer of GEMs to native species, and uncontrolled propagation, especially when they are to be widely distributed [39, 293]. The serious consequences of vertical gene transfer between GMOs and their wild-type counterparts were shown in studies involving transgenic fish released into natural populations of the same species. The genetically altered fish's enhanced capacity for reproduction led to a reduction in the survivability of their offspring [40]. Furthermore, to prevent the introduction of unwanted genetic features and make the behavior of a GEM more predictable, the capacity of GEMs to disseminate new genetic information to potential recipients must be restricted. Also, in order to prevent GEMs from spreading and having an adverse effect on the native population of organisms, their survival must be restricted in both time and space, or through the establishment of a controlled life cycle (biological confinement) [39]. For instance, during a study, it was stated that the growth of monarch butterflies by consuming pollinated leaves from genetically modified corn is slowed down and the chance of their death increases because GM crops reduce the number of insects that provide food for birds and other wildlife, and from this it harms biodiversity [41]. Genetically modified foods and the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes to gut flora can expose people to new allergies [40]. For example, Seralini et al.'s study revealed that rats fed transgenic NK-603 Roundup Ready maize had higher tumor incidence, chronic kidney disease, liver congestion, necrosis, and higher female mortality [42]. In addition to putting human health at risk, horizontal gene transfer of pesticide, herbicide, or antibiotic resistance to other species will upset ecological balances by enabling previously innocuous plants to proliferate unrestrained and so boosting the spread of pathogens between plants and animals [43]. Additionally, recent research has demonstrated that probiotics can evolve undesirable traits during treatment or diagnosis including acquiring harmful functions such as competitive elimination of native microbes, pathogenic potential against host or environment, or loss of beneficial functions of the engineered system; therefore, biocontrol strategies preventing or minimizing the entry or any penetration of GMOs into the environment are needed [44, 45, 260, 294\u2013296]. Although we may not be able to accurately predict the interaction of each genetically engineered microorganism with the environment, several biocontainment strategies of various degrees of efficiency and stability have been developed such as the use of auxotrophy and synthetic amino acids. Auxotrophy is the elimination of the ability of an organism to synthesize a vital compound that it must receive from its growth medium or its environment and can help to inhibit microorganism in the laboratory environment. These vital compounds include somethings essential for cell survival or those needed in high concentrations which cause the maximum effectiveness of this method [250, 297\u2013299]. Notably, inducible systems or auxotrophy does not address the potential risk of genetic information escape, i.e., horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, the limitation of this method is that they may require additional survival factors and supplemental probiotic media [197, 251]. Cellular circuits contain lethal switches, as well as addiction modules, all of which achieve inhibition by binding cells to a specific compound (or lack thereof) or genetic information, and thus lethal components are expressed in response to environmental signals and finally cause cell death in response to an inducing chemical. Control of cell survival is done through expression of lysis proteins and destruction of essential proteins and toxins. For example, in E. coli, the \u201cbioretention circuits\u201d included temperature sensors to differentiate between physiological and environmental temperatures [150, 251\u2013253, 300, 301]. Another solution for intoxicating GMOs in environment is toxin-antitoxin systems consisting of stable and unstable toxins. To prevent the transfer of genetic information in the horizontal gene transfer, toxin and antitoxin systems can be placed in different parts of the cell's genetic repository. For example, the toxin is placed on the plasmid and the antitoxin on the chromosome; therefore, during horizontal gene transfer, the plasmid that does not carry the antitoxin will kill the new host [257]. Understanding how to evaluate the impact on biodiversity is necessary for this technology to be accepted despite its many positive effects on the environment and economy. The assessment of future genetically modified organisms' effects on biodiversity requires ongoing updates to this knowledge (https://www.government.nl/topics/biotechnology/consequences-of-gmos-for-biodiversity). Due to their inherent properties in degradability, they are eliminated by themselves in the body and will not have side effects or will be less. However, their safety and control still need to be studied (2).", "13. Assessment of Stability of Genetic Construct", "13. Assessment of Stability of Genetic Construct", "The delivery of drugs using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their utilization in treatment offer several advantages over traditional treatments. These advantages include a significant reduction in costs through the production of a large number of engineered bacteria compared to biological molecules. Furthermore, treatment with GMOs can result in limited side effects due to their nonaggressive nature during administration. Also, less dosage than biological compounds is another advantage of GMOs, but before using these strains for clinical trials and recommending them to humans, considerations such as genetic stability, avoiding antibiotic-resistant genes, and maintaining genetic integrity are necessary to produce them in high concentrations [197, 258, 259]. Use of regulators and adding sensors, kill switches, delivery tools, and memory circuits have paved the way for genetic engineering. To increase genetic stability, most GMOs carry recombinant DNA in their chromosomes because plasmids are not genetically stable due to unequal distribution between daughter cells during cell division; also, they are lost in the absence of selective pressure [109, 120, 196, 302]. In addition, by removing an essential gene and using a single copy of plasmid from the same gene in the host, the induction and suppression systems can be used for long-term maintenance of plasmids and to overcome the genetic stability challenge. E. coli strain Nissle 1917 designed in Danino et al.'s study to harbor the toxin and the alp7AR cassette encoded in the short-lived plasmid provides equal separation during cell division by producing alp protein strands and the antitoxin encoded in the host chromosome, which ultimately causes cell death when this plasmid is transferred [109, 196].", "The delivery of drugs using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their utilization in treatment offer several advantages over traditional treatments.

Therefore, L form bacteria is using which hypotonic pressure select for cell lysis occurred and mutated (or engineered phages) release. Recombination-based methods are divided into two in vivo recombination and BRED and Crisper-Cas based method. Edited templates which were infected in host cell recombine through phage genome replication, and then, mixture of wild-type and recombinant phages was produced. In contrast to synthetic biology method, in last step of BRED and in vivo recombination method, screening is conducted to select certain and appropriate strain by plaque screening method.", "Figure 2Medical applications for genetically engineered bacteria (GEB). Infectious disease: GEB can combat bacterial infections by (1) the release of toxins and toxins neutralization and (2) the production of QS components that lead to the expression of surface adhesion preventing pathogenic colonization and production of antimicrobial factors mediating bacterial killing. Also, GEB can be designed to secret antibody-like fragments to prevent pathogenic bacterial adhesion to host cells. Metabolic disorders: GEB can release antibody fragments against pro-inflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines, antioxidants, or certain enzymes. Cancer: GEB (1) can accumulate and replicate in cancerous cells and subsequently express certain bacterial toxins, the converting enzymes, pro-cytokines, and apoptosis inducer molecules. (2) GEB can harbor plasmid encoding shRNA for silencing genes after transformation into cancerous cells. Vaccination: GEB (1) can promote immune cell recognition and uptake of antigens through the expression of intracellular/ surface antigens via bacteria chassis as an adjuvant, (2) designing and engineering an antigen by dendritic cells-targeting peptides, and (3) packaging antigen into the outer membrane vesicles for enhancing immune cell recognition and uptake of recombinant antigen.", "Medical applications for genetically engineered bacteria (GEB).
