["The increasing incidence of drug- resistant pathogens raises an urgent need to identify and isolate new bioactive compounds from medicinal plants using standardized modern analytical procedures. Medicinal plant-derived compounds could provide novel straightforward approaches against pathogenic bacteria. This review explores the antimicrobial activity of plant-derived components, their possible mechanisms of action, as well as their chemical potential. The focus is put on the current challenges and future perspectives surrounding medicinal plants antimicrobial activity. There are some inherent challenges regarding medicinal plant extracts and their antimicrobial efficacy. Appropriate and optimized extraction methodology plant species dependent leads to upgraded and selective extracted compounds. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests for the determination of the antimicrobial activity of plant extracts may show variations in obtained results. Moreover, there are several difficulties and problems that need to be overcome for the development of new antimicrobials from plant extracts, while efforts have been made to enhance the antimicrobial activity of chemical compounds. Research on the mechanisms of action, interplay with other substances, and the pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile of the medicinal plant extracts should be given high priority to characterize them as potential antimicrobial agents.", "1.

The Challenges of Development New Antimicrobials from Medicinal Plant Extracts", "7.4. The Challenges of Development New Antimicrobials from Medicinal Plant Extracts", "7.4. The Challenges of Development New Antimicrobials from Medicinal Plant Extracts", "Scientific investigation of new plant extracts is challenging because of their immense complexity and variability [33,219,220]. Indeed, plant extracts may contain hundreds or even thousands of individual compounds in varying abundance and locating the compounds responsible for a given biological effect represents a significant concern [221]. There are several challenges that need to be overcome for the development of new antimicrobials that can face the current spreading of antibiotic resistance:The translation of in vitro studies to in vivo experiments and finally to human clinical trials has been the major challenge in the development of new antimicrobials. In vivo research should be carried out for a better understanding of the exact mechanisms of the medicinal plant chemical compounds and whether they can be considered an alternative or supplement to the existing strategies for the treatments of microbial diseases.Only medicinal plant extracts that inhibit the growth of microorganisms in low or moderated MIC values should deserve the utmost attention and additional research may be done [24].Extracts should also be tested for their MBC, because the bactericidal potential hinders the possibility of antimicrobial resistance.The utilization of unique traditional knowledge of medicinal plants medicine has great potential to generate biocompatible solutions and will hasten the discovery of new antimicrobials. This knowledge is important to design efficient and environmentally friendly technologies of fractionation and contribute to the effective exploitation of bioactive plant extracts.The method of extraction and in vitro testing should be standardized so that the search for new antimicrobial drugs from medicinal plants could be more systematic, and it will facilitate proper interpretation of results [34].Despite the increasing number of compounds isolated from antimicrobial medicinal plants, there are still only relatively few plant-derived drugs in clinical use. This may be because plant compounds often require complex combination effects between components to synergize the activity of the bioactive compound. A number of studies have shown that the overall activity of plant extracts can result from mixtures of compounds with synergistic, additive, and antagonistic activity [33,222,223,224,225]. Therefore, a major concern in the development of antimicrobials from medicinal plants is related to the possibility of synergism or antagonism effects due to the complexity in extracts composition [80,226]. Synergism within and between plant extracts have been extensively reviewed, providing compelling evidence that at least in some cases, the combined effect of plant mixtures is not simply the summation of their individual compounds [33,220,224,227,228,229]. However, it is likely that such combinations could produce antagonism, leading to the cancelation of the therapeutic effect [189]. The classification of combination effects within complex mixtures and the identification of contributing compounds remains a challenging task, particularly when most established tools have been designed to reduce complexity and identify single active compounds of natural products mixtures. Therefore, the use of bioassay-guided or synergy-guided fractionation to predict which compounds/mixtures are responsible for a specific activity is of extreme importance [225].Recent developments in metabolomics may play a key role in the identification and effective application of new occurring natural antimicrobials. Statistical modeling used to predict and correlate the metabolomic profile of extracts and their bioactivity has gained much attention [227]. However, there is a lack of consensus in the field about which reference models are best for defining combination effects, making the interpretation of studies challenging. Recent models using the specific mean equation [230] and the zero-interaction potency model [231] represent newly developed and robust reference models that may permit improved identification combination effects. There are also several emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology and bio-adhesive technology and materials, namely hydrogel formulations and active packaging materials which can enhance the effectiveness of plant antimicrobial compounds.The development of antimicrobials for oral therapy requires the application of methodologies that consider the effect of digestion on the bioactivity of the extracts [232]. However, even using sophisticated in vitro digestion models, it is still impossible to fully mimic the overall digestive parameters in vivo.Studies concerning the toxicity of the most promising medicinal plant extracts are major challenge for their use as antimicrobials [233,234]. Most extracts have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [235]. Therefore, the lack of official information regarding the actual toxicity of many extracts is concerning, since the adverse effects caused by the misuse of medicinal plants are characterized as a public health problem [236]. Reasons for plant extracts toxicity are improper identification/authentication and improper labeling on standardization. Thus, the extracts should be regulated through official controls and rigorous manufacturing standards.Another challenge in the development of antimicrobials from the medicinal plants is related to poor financial support for research and therefore lack of high- quality studies on the comprehension of structure-activity relationship with individual compounds [76].", "Scientific investigation of new plant extracts is challenging because of their immense complexity and variability [33,219,220]. Indeed, plant extracts may contain hundreds or even thousands of individual compounds in varying abundance and locating the compounds responsible for a given biological effect represents a significant concern [221]. There are several challenges that need to be overcome for the development of new antimicrobials that can face the current spreading of antibiotic resistance:The translation of in vitro studies to in vivo experiments and finally to human clinical trials has been the major challenge in the development of new antimicrobials. In vivo research should be carried out for a better understanding of the exact mechanisms of the medicinal plant chemical compounds and whether they can be considered an alternative or supplement to the existing strategies for the treatments of microbial diseases.Only medicinal plant extracts that inhibit the growth of microorganisms in low or moderated MIC values should deserve the utmost attention and additional research may be done [24].Extracts should also be tested for their MBC, because the bactericidal potential hinders the possibility of antimicrobial resistance.The utilization of unique traditional knowledge of medicinal plants medicine has great potential to generate biocompatible solutions and will hasten the discovery of new antimicrobials. This knowledge is important to design efficient and environmentally friendly technologies of fractionation and contribute to the effective exploitation of bioactive plant extracts.The method of extraction and in vitro testing should be standardized so that the search for new antimicrobial drugs from medicinal plants could be more systematic, and it will facilitate proper interpretation of results [34].Despite the increasing number of compounds isolated from antimicrobial medicinal plants, there are still only relatively few plant-derived drugs in clinical use. This may be because plant compounds often require complex combination effects between components to synergize the activity of the bioactive compound. A number of studies have shown that the overall activity of plant extracts can result from mixtures of compounds with synergistic, additive, and antagonistic activity [33,222,223,224,225]. Therefore, a major concern in the development of antimicrobials from medicinal plants is related to the possibility of synergism or antagonism effects due to the complexity in extracts composition [80,226]. Synergism within and between plant extracts have been extensively reviewed, providing compelling evidence that at least in some cases, the combined effect of plant mixtures is not simply the summation of their individual compounds [33,220,224,227,228,229]. However, it is likely that such combinations could produce antagonism, leading to the cancelation of the therapeutic effect [189]. The classification of combination effects within complex mixtures and the identification of contributing compounds remains a challenging task, particularly when most established tools have been designed to reduce complexity and identify single active compounds of natural products mixtures. Therefore, the use of bioassay-guided or synergy-guided fractionation to predict which compounds/mixtures are responsible for a specific activity is of extreme importance [225].Recent developments in metabolomics may play a key role in the identification and effective application of new occurring natural antimicrobials. Statistical modeling used to predict and correlate the metabolomic profile of extracts and their bioactivity has gained much attention [227]. However, there is a lack of consensus in the field about which reference models are best for defining combination effects, making the interpretation of studies challenging. Recent models using the specific mean equation [230] and the zero-interaction potency model [231] represent newly developed and robust reference models that may permit improved identification combination effects. There are also several emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology and bio-adhesive technology and materials, namely hydrogel formulations and active packaging materials which can enhance the effectiveness of plant antimicrobial compounds.The development of antimicrobials for oral therapy requires the application of methodologies that consider the effect of digestion on the bioactivity of the extracts [232]. However, even using sophisticated in vitro digestion models, it is still impossible to fully mimic the overall digestive parameters in vivo.Studies concerning the toxicity of the most promising medicinal plant extracts are major challenge for their use as antimicrobials [233,234].

Study Limitations", "8. Study Limitations", "Our findings should be interpreted in light of their limitations. The correlation of medicinal plant extracts and antimicrobial activity seems to be significant, however, current knowledge is mainly based on in vitro studies, hence its applicability in the clinical setting remains rather unknown. Compounds that have shown antimicrobial activity in vitro may have little or no effect in vivo. This may be because compounds often require combinational effects between compounds to synergize the activity of bioactive compounds and technology to study this has not yet been fully developed. Indeed, chemometric models are subject to limitations based on the biological assays and reference models used to define biological activity. Additionally, the linear regression models used to predict bioactive compounds are limited given that true linear relationships rarely exist, particularly when assessing complex mixtures with numerous unknown combination effects.", "Our findings should be interpreted in light of their limitations.
