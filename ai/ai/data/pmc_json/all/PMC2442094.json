The mean Blast score of these CDSs was 381 for the comparison between Mic-PCC7806 and Cwa-WH8501, and only 366 for Mic-PCC7806 versus Syn-PCC6803. The distribution curve of all the Blast scores (see Additional file 2) showed that the Mic-PCC7806 genome was more closely related to Cwa-WH8501 than to Syn-PCC6803 for all score values considered. The absence of congruence between the results obtained with rDNA sequences and the core proteins means that additional data sets for other members of these three cyanobacterial genera are required. Nevertheless, the results obtained by comparing all the orthologous genes shared by Mic-PCC7806 (freshwater strain) and Cwa-WH8501 (marine strain) are consistent with the fact that freshwater and marine cyanobacteria are interspersed in global 16S rDNA phylogenetic trees [20].", "Distribution of the best Blastp of the Mic-PCC7806 proteome against other cyanobacterial proteomes", "Distribution of the best Blastp of the Mic-PCC7806 proteome against other cyanobacterial proteomes", "Distribution of the best Blastp of the Mic-PCC7806 proteome against other cyanobacterial proteomes", "No Significant HSP 14.4%.", "No Significant HSP 14.4%.", "No Significant HSP 14.4%.", "Cth-ATCC51142 15.5%.", "Cth-ATCC51142 15.5%.", "Cth-ATCC51142 15.5%.", "Cth-CCY0110 13.4%.", "Cth-CCY0110 13.4%.", "Cth-CCY0110 13.4%.", "Cwa-WH8501 9.9%.", "Cwa-WH8501 9.9%.", "Cwa-WH8501 9.9%.", "Mch-PCC7420 9%.", "Mch-PCC7420 9%.", "Mch-PCC7420 9%.", "Npu-PCC73102 5.8%.", "Npu-PCC73102 5.8%.", "Npu-PCC73102 5.8%.", "Syn-PCC6803 5.1%.", "Syn-PCC6803 5.1%.", "Syn-PCC6803 5.1%.", "Ana-PCC7120 4.3%.", "Ana-PCC7120 4.3%.", "Ana-PCC7120 4.3%.", "Nsp-CCY9414 4.2%.", "Nsp-CCY9414 4.2%.", "Nsp-CCY9414 4.2%.", "Lae-PCC8106 4%.", "Lae-PCC8106 4%.", "Lae-PCC8106 4%.", "Ava-ATCC29413 3.9%.", "Ava-ATCC29413 3.9%.", "Ava-ATCC29413 3.9%.", "Ama-MBIC11017 2.5%.", "Ama-MBIC11017 2.5%.", "Ama-MBIC11017 2.5%.", "Ter-IMS101 1.95%.", "Ter-IMS101 1.95%.", "Ter-IMS101 1.95%.", "Syn-PCC7002 1.6%.", "Syn-PCC7002 1.6%.", "Syn-PCC7002 1.6%.", "Gvi-PCC7421 1.15%.", "Gvi-PCC7421 1.15%.", "Gvi-PCC7421 1.15%.", "Syn-PCC7335 1%.", "Syn-PCC7335 1%.", "Syn-PCC7335 1%.", "Syn-PCC7942 0.5%.", "Syn-PCC7942 0.5%.", "Syn-PCC7942 0.5%.", "Tel-BP1 0.4%.", "Tel-BP1 0.4%.", "Tel-BP1 0.4%.", "Syn-WH5701 0.2%.", "Syn-WH5701 0.2%.", "Syn-WH5701 0.2%.", "Syn-JA-2-3B'a 0.1%.", "Syn-JA-2-3B'a 0.1%.", "Syn-JA-2-3B'a 0.1%.", "Syn-PCC6301 0.1%.", "Syn-PCC6301 0.1%.", "Syn-PCC6301 0.1%.", "Other genomes 0%.", "Other genomes 0%.", "Other genomes 0%.", "See the Methods section for the strain identifiers.

Some of these clusters are clearly linked to a specific biological function, such as the transport of phosphate (see Additional file 4) [24], while others consist of conserved proteins with unknown functions.

As shown by Guljamow et al. [37], this eukaryotic-like actin forms a shell-like structure that could strengthen cell resistance to hydrostatic and osmotic pressures. Interestingly, these genes are only present in Microcystis cells that inhabit the Braakman water reservoir (The Netherlands), which was cut off from the sea in the 20th century, and from which the Mic-PCC7806 strain was originally isolated.", "Although several different M. aeruginosa morphotypes have been described [38], little is known about their colony formation. The genome sequence of strain Mic-PCC7806 revealed a gene coding for a lectin (mvn; mic3128), which binds specifically to a sugar moiety present on the surface of Mic-PCC7806 cells, and a binding partner has been identified in the lipoplysaccharide fraction [39]. A functional correlation between the potent toxin microcystin and this lectin has been demonstrated, with possible implications for the formation of colonial aggregates that are characteristic of different Microcystis morphotypes. Another protein, MrpC (microcystin-related protein C), has been shown to be a potential target of an O-glycosyltransferase of the SPINDLY family [40]. In situ, this protein accumulates at the cell surface, and is involved in cellular interactions. Microcystins may therefore have an impact on the aggregation of Microcystis cells, which is very important for the competitive advantage of these organisms over other phytoplankton species. Mvn and MrpC are predominantly encoded in toxic strains [[38] and E. Dittmann, unpublished data], but not in the genome of Mic-NIES843. The latter strain may thus represent an ecotype that differs from Mic-PCC7806 in the characteristics of the cell surface. Genes coding for a Ser/Thr kinase (mic0129) and a Ser/Thr phosphatase of the PPP family (mic4622) are found within two clusters that may be involved in cell wall synthesis. Mic-PCC7806 also has two genes that encode Wzc-like protein Tyr kinases (mic2086 and mic1089) and three genes coding for Wzb-like protein Tyr phosphatases (mic3515, mic3588 and mic6566). In E. coli, the function of these systems is known to be related to the synthesis of the cell wall and polysaccharides [41]. These kinases/phosphatases could potentially be involved in colony formation. Colony migration depends not only on the cell ballast resulting from the accumulation of photosynthates and the size of the colonies, but also on the synthesis of gas vesicles (GV), intracellular structures providing cells with buoyancy [42]. The Mic-PCC7806 genome carries a cluster of 12 genes required for GV synthesis, two of which, gvpV and gvpW, are novel [43]. The mic1271 and mic1270 genes are highly similar to the genes coding for a light-regulated two-component system in Syn-PCC6803. This system, which consists of a cyanobacterial phytochrome (Cph1) and its response regulator (Rcp1), has been proposed to play a role in the control of processes required for the adaptation from light to dark conditions and vice-versa [44]. Moreover, all the genes involved in circadian rhythm [45] are present in Mic-PCC7806 (see Additional file 11). Whether day-night cycles and the timing of vertical migration of Microcystis colonies in the water column are controlled by this phytochrome and by the circadian clock mechanism would be worth being tested.", "Although several different M. aeruginosa morphotypes have been described [38], little is known about their colony formation.

Consequently, these three proteins are likely involved in other functions than PCD.

Both mic1068 and mic5406 are expressed, and a cross-reaction with human caspase-3 polyclonal antisera was observed indicating that the proteins are synthesized (data not shown). Alignment of the regions containing the conserved caspase domains of Mic1068, Mic5406, MAE24870 and a yeast metacaspase shows that the Histidine-Cysteine catalytic diad of the key functionnal regions of the capases is conserved (see Additional file 12).

Microcystis colonies may display chaotic population dynamics, with alternating explosion and crash phases [75], but to the best of our knowledge, no such data are available for Crocosphaera. Such chaotic population dynamics could explain the widespread occurrence of rearrangements in the Mic-PCC7806 genome, if, as proposed by Helm et al. [76] for Salmonella serovars, bottlenecks and genetic drifts generally promote the fixation of mildly harmful rearrangements.", "More genome sequences of members of the Microcystis and Crocosphaera genera are required to clarify the molecular basis of their genome plasticity, at both the intergeneric and intraspecies levels. This will also provide a deeper understanding of the evolutionary significance of this mode of adaptation to the environment. The ongoing sequencing of such genomes should make it possible to reach this goal in the near future. More generally, large cyanobacterial genomes constitute excellent model systems for studying genome dynamics and the mechanism(s) by which some gene clusters may escape rearrangement and retain the same physical organization in several different lineages.", "More genome sequences of members of the Microcystis and Crocosphaera genera are required to clarify the molecular basis of their genome plasticity, at both the intergeneric and intraspecies levels.
