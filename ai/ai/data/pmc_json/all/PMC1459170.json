Like pBc10987, emetic strains seem to lack the B. anthracis PAI encoded virulence genes since no hybridization signals were obtained with probes targeting these genes (Table 4). The data presented in this work will contribute to developing a better understanding of the evolution and distribution of this group of plasmids. One might speculate that a plasmid in an ancestral form has been present in B. cereus group strains, which over time has acquired virulence genes conveying different disease causing phenotypes. Nevertheless, a detailed phylogenetic analysis of plasmids-focusing on mobile elements- from all members of the B. cereus group will be necessary to unravel the role of plasmids in pathogenesis and evolution of the B. cereus group of organisms.", "Conclusion", "Conclusion", "The characterization of the ces genes illustrated the high flexibility of the module organization of bacterial NRPS. A new type of insertion in A domains has been observed in the modules CesA1 and CesB1. No clear function could be assigned to the inserted domains, although hundreds of NRPS modules have been sequenced and biochemically characterized. The characterization of the cereulide synthetase genes and its flanking regions revealed the extra-chromosomal location of the main virulence factor of emetic B. cereus on a plasmid with a pXO1-like backbone.
