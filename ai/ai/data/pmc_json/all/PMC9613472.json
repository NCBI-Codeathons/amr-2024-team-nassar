["Klebsiella spp. that secrete the DNA-alkylating enterotoxin tilimycin colonize the human intestinal tract. Numbers of toxigenic bacteria increase during antibiotic use, and the resulting accumulation of tilimycin in the intestinal lumen damages the epithelium via genetic instability and apoptosis. Here we examine the impact of this genotoxin on the gut ecosystem. 16S rRNA sequencing of faecal samples from mice colonized with Klebsiella oxytoca strains and mechanistic analyses show that tilimycin is a pro-mutagenic antibiotic affecting multiple phyla. Transient synthesis of tilimycin in the murine gut antagonized niche competitors, reduced microbial richness and altered taxonomic composition of the microbiota both during and following exposure. Moreover, tilimycin secretion increased rates of mutagenesis in co-resident opportunistic pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, as shown by de novo acquisition of antibiotic resistance. We conclude that tilimycin is a bacterial mutagen, and flares of genotoxic Klebsiella have the potential to drive the emergence of resistance, destabilize the gut microbiota and shape its evolutionary trajectory.", "Production of the enterotoxin tilimycin by gut-resident Klebsiella species can alter gut microbiota composition, induce mutational evolution and drive the emergence of antibiotic resistance in mice.", "Subject terms", "Main", "Main", "The human gut microbiota has vast functional potential1,2.

Mice were stably colonized with K. oxytoca until day 13 when Curam was withdrawn (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). High faecal concentrations of TM were present from days 3 to 10 (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The impact of Curam on bacterial diversity is illustrated in Fig. 3b. Before treatment, each cohort showed the same high taxonomic richness (Fig. 3b), but reliable datasets were not retrieved for any group on day 0 (24\u2009h post-Curam) (Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013e). Nonetheless, comparison of the total reads retrieved over time showed no lasting reduction or differences between the infection groups (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Notably, K. oxytoca supported comparatively richer communities than the mock control throughout the experiment independently of TM production (Fig. 3b). That finding is consistent with other in vivo studies showing that \u00df-lactamase-producing bacteria, such as K. oxytoca, lower the effective concentration of amoxicillin in the gut and thereby facilitate the growth of susceptible bacteria34,35. Importantly for this analysis, the additional presence of abundant TM at day 6 limited the number of observable features significantly compared with non-producers. This difference was eliminated by day 12 when faecal TM was no longer measured. Richness continued to increase for both colonized groups after day 12, yet the community succession occurring in this timescale remained significantly less diverse following TM exposure (Fig. 3b). Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity measured over this timeframe revealed that TM not only lowered diversity but also significantly shifted the composition of the succession communities (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To reveal phylogenetic differences between these communities, we calculated unweighted-UniFrac distances (Fig. 3c). The PCoA shows that the initial communities in all cohorts before Curam treatment were highly similar. After day 6 of K. oxytoca colonization with and without TM exposure, the composition of the AHC-6- and \u0394npsB-containing communities diverged strongly. By day 19, the composition of the successive bacteria in each cohort recovered some features of the pre-Curam state (Fig. 3d), but remained significantly distinct from each other (Fig. 3c). Recovery towards pre-treatment beta diversity in this timescale was most pronounced in animals carrying the non-genotoxic strain (Fig. 3d).Fig. 3Variance of microbial diversity and composition during TM exposure and in the subsequent community succession.a, Quantification of TM and K. oxytoca in faeces and caecal content (day 20) of mice colonized with AHC-6, \u0394npsB (n\u2009=\u20096 mice per group) or mock control animals (n\u2009=\u20096, no K. oxytoca or TM detected).

That finding is consistent with other in vivo studies showing that \u00df-lactamase-producing bacteria, such as K. oxytoca, lower the effective concentration of amoxicillin in the gut and thereby facilitate the growth of susceptible bacteria34,35. Importantly for this analysis, the additional presence of abundant TM at day 6 limited the number of observable features significantly compared with non-producers. This difference was eliminated by day 12 when faecal TM was no longer measured. Richness continued to increase for both colonized groups after day 12, yet the community succession occurring in this timescale remained significantly less diverse following TM exposure (Fig. 3b). Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity measured over this timeframe revealed that TM not only lowered diversity but also significantly shifted the composition of the succession communities (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To reveal phylogenetic differences between these communities, we calculated unweighted-UniFrac distances (Fig. 3c). The PCoA shows that the initial communities in all cohorts before Curam treatment were highly similar. After day 6 of K. oxytoca colonization with and without TM exposure, the composition of the AHC-6- and \u0394npsB-containing communities diverged strongly. By day 19, the composition of the successive bacteria in each cohort recovered some features of the pre-Curam state (Fig. 3d), but remained significantly distinct from each other (Fig. 3c). Recovery towards pre-treatment beta diversity in this timescale was most pronounced in animals carrying the non-genotoxic strain (Fig. 3d).Fig. 3Variance of microbial diversity and composition during TM exposure and in the subsequent community succession.a, Quantification of TM and K. oxytoca in faeces and caecal content (day 20) of mice colonized with AHC-6, \u0394npsB (n\u2009=\u20096 mice per group) or mock control animals (n\u2009=\u20096, no K. oxytoca or TM detected).

Mice were stably colonized with K. oxytoca until day 13 when Curam was withdrawn (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). High faecal concentrations of TM were present from days 3 to 10 (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The impact of Curam on bacterial diversity is illustrated in Fig. 3b. Before treatment, each cohort showed the same high taxonomic richness (Fig. 3b), but reliable datasets were not retrieved for any group on day 0 (24\u2009h post-Curam) (Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013e). Nonetheless, comparison of the total reads retrieved over time showed no lasting reduction or differences between the infection groups (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Notably, K. oxytoca supported comparatively richer communities than the mock control throughout the experiment independently of TM production (Fig. 3b). That finding is consistent with other in vivo studies showing that \u00df-lactamase-producing bacteria, such as K. oxytoca, lower the effective concentration of amoxicillin in the gut and thereby facilitate the growth of susceptible bacteria34,35. Importantly for this analysis, the additional presence of abundant TM at day 6 limited the number of observable features significantly compared with non-producers.
