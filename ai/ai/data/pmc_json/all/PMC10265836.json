["Multiple drug resistance poses a significant threat to public health worldwide, with a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality rates. Consequently, searching for novel strategies to control microbial pathogenicity is necessary. With the aid of auto-inducers (AIs), quorum sensing (QS) regulates bacterial virulence factors through cell-to-cell signaling networks. AIs are small signaling molecules produced during the stationary phase. When bacterial cultures reach a certain level of growth, these molecules regulate the expression of the bound genes by acting as mirrors that reflect the inoculum density.", "Gram-positive bacteria use the peptide derivatives of these signaling molecules, whereas Gram-negative bacteria use the fatty acid derivatives, and the majority of bacteria can use both types to modulate the expression of the target gene.

The misuse and overuse of antibiotics diminished their efficacy against infectious diseases and contributed to the emergence of microbial resistance [6]. External factors, such as the inappropriate use of antibiotics in poultry, aquaculture, and agriculture, have contributed to MDR.

The application of antibiotics to protect aquatic organisms is a simple option, but it can lead to MDR, particularly when they are used in sub-MIC concentrations [1]. Consequently, QSIs must be utilized to control the pathogenicity and virulence factors of these pathogens [133]. Some micro- and macroalgae produce QSIs, like Chlorella saccharophila CCAP211, which decreases the bioluminescence of V. harveyi and reduces the violacein production in C. violaceum CV026 without any effect on growth [134]. Moreover, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii microalga inhibited some QS-mediated phenotypes, such as luminescence [135]. Similarly, the red macroalga Delisea pulchra was reported to produce halogenated furanone that inhibited QS-regulated phenotypes [136]. Some sponges, such as Haliclona megastoma, Aphrocallistes bocagei, and Clathria atrasanguinea approved for their efficacy against violacein pigment production in C. violaceum CV026 and ATCC 12,472. They also inhibited biofilm formation, protease, and hemolysin production of S. marcescens [137].", "Aquaculture and fisheries departments are a highly viable food source, especially for those living in coastal regions [132].

It has been demonstrated to be an efficient anti-infective technique in several host-microbe systems [45]. Prior studies reported that pathogens are unlikely to develop resistance to the QSI tactics because they pose no selective pressure on bacteria [5, 12, 138]. However, some studies showed the possibility of development of resistance against QSI [139]. Due to nalC and mexR mutations, P. aeruginosa developed resistance to the QSI; brominated furanone C-30 [140]. Similarly, Garc\u00eda-Contreras et al.

Furthermore, the formation of bacterial biofilms has been identified as one of the most challenging aspects of treating clinical bacterial infections. Additionally, the QS system has been shown to regulate bacterial efflux pumps and biofilm formation in multidrug-resistant bacteria. Consequently, QQ strategies could offer a novel approach to combating microbial resistance by regulating the expression of efflux pump genes and inhibiting bacterial invasiveness and infectiousness. Antimicrobial resistance regulation through control of QS signaling molecules in clinical isolates requires additional research. Consequently, innovation and advancement in research on QQ molecules and their effects on regulatory systems will result in the introduction of new QQ molecules to combat microbial resistance. The discovery of QQ molecules is expected to increase significantly over the upcoming decades, and they could be used as coating agents in medical devices, replacing bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics in-vivo.", "The emergence of resistance is the result of a natural evolutionary process that encourages the development of resistant strains through selection pressure.
