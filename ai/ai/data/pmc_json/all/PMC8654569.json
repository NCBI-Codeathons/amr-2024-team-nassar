Discussion", "4. Discussion", "Myocardial infarction is one of the five major manifestations of coronary heart disease. Thrombolytic therapy and interventional therapy are currently the main methods to alleviate myocardial ischemia injury in clinical practice. However, myocardial reperfusion will cause more serious injury or death, and MI/R injury is also an important influencing factor for poor prognosis of patients with coronary heart disease (17, 18). With the development of therapeutic drugs and methods, myocardial reperfusion has been continuously improved, but there is still a lack of effective means to prevent MI/R injury (19). The results of this study revealed that miR-21 could mediate FGF1 to protect myocardium of rats under ischemia reperfusion and reduce myocardial cell apoptosis, which may become a therapeutic target for preventing MI/R injury in the future.", "Myocardial infarction is one of the five major manifestations of coronary heart disease.

As we expected, all electrophysiological indexes of the heart of each rat were abnormal, including decreased SBP and CF and increased DBP and HR. Based on dissection of the rats, a large area of myocardial infarction was found, and it was also found that the myocardial tissues of the rats showed significantly lowered expression of miR-21 and FGF1, increased VEGF and bax levels, and lowered expression of bcl-2. It indicated that myocardial cell apoptosis was enhanced, but the rats also underwent ischemic preconditioning, and the VEGF expression promoted angiogenesis and maintained cardiac blood supply. During the recovery of blood supply in rats, we interfered the expression of miR-21 and FGF1 in the rats. The increase in the expression of miR-21 and FGF1 in myocardial cells of the rats suggested that we had successfully intervened it. Meantime, compared with the model rats not intervened, the rats showed some significantly improved cardiac function indexes, decreased myocardial INF, lowered level of the apoptosis factor, bax, and increased levels of antiapoptosis factors, bcl-2, and VEGF. It indicated that both miR-21 and FGF1 could intensity the resistance of myocardium against apoptosis caused by MI/R injury to protect cardiac function, and the simultaneous intervention of miR-21 and FGF1 could bring a more significant result. Correlation analysis results also revealed that miR-21 and FGF1 were significantly and linearly correlated with cardiac function, INF, bax, and bcl-2 in rats. Although our results showed that both miR-21 and FGF1 could promote the VEGF expression, we did not find any correlation between them. We speculated that it may be related to the self-resistance of rats against I/R injury. In this pathological process, many factors contribute to the increase of VEGF expression level to adapt to myocardial infarction. In addition, we also found that the expression of miR-21 had a significant positive correlation with that of FGF1. In order to verify whether there is an expression regulation relationship between miR-21 and FGF1, we extracted myocardial cells from neonatal rats and cultured them. It was turned out that downregulation of FGF1 expression could inhibit miR-21 from protecting myocardial cells from the injury caused by hypoxia/reoxygenation.

Therefore, based on these results, it can be concluded that miR-21 can targetedly mediate the expression of FGF1 to alleviate MI/R injury, protect cardiac function, and resist apoptosis.", "We constructed rat models of MI/R injury by clamping and then releasing LAD.

MiR-21/PDCD4 pathway can protect myocardial cells and weaken apoptosis caused by oxidative stress injury (20). In addition, miR-21 can regulate the TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway to reduce the release of inflammatory factors and relieve myocardial cell injury during MI/R injury in rats (21). In addition to I/R injury in myocardium, miR-21 is also closely related to that in the kidney and brain (22, 23). Generally, miR-21 decreases during I/R injury, but the increase of it can protect organs by mainly reducing apoptosis and inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors. Vascular regeneration and microcirculation reconstruction are very important for the treatment of myocardial infarction. Many studies also reported that miR-21 was related to vascular regeneration, and overexpression of miR-21 could activate hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 to promote neovascularization during limb ischemia reperfusion injury (24).

As mentioned earlier, Liu et al. (13) concluded that miR-21 suppressed the apoptosis of growth plate chondrocytes and promoted proliferation by targetedly inhibiting FGF1. Moreover, miR-21 may not entirely beneficial against MI/R injury. A study concluded that miR-21 targeted Smad 7 to promote myocardial fibrosis after myocardial infarction, and Smad 7 could regulate tumor necrosis factor beta signal transduction (26, 27). FGF1 is a profibrogenic factor. For example, it promotes pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis (28, 29). However, there is no report on the relationship between FGF1 and myocardial fibrosis, which needs further research and analysis. In addition, the intervention method adopted in this study is ischemic postconditioning, and the role of ischemic preconditioning intervention has not been verified. We will further improve our analysis in future studies. As this is a single/limited region study, a multiregional or multicentric approach may provide a broad picture which can further enhance the validity of the prospective results. So far, not many efforts have been directed towards establishing a significant association between some of the circulatory candidate miRNAs and the severity of CAD when developing a noninvasive diagnostic method that can help in reducing coronary complications. Considering CAD as a multifactorial and multigenic disease driven by various genetic and nongenetic factors, observations from the current study appear to support the assumption that miRNA signatures have important implications on CAD and its different stages.", "However, miR-21 and FGF1 may play different roles in different cells.
