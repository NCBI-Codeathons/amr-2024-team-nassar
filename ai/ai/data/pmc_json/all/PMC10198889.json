Current recommendations clearly define the frequency, intensity, type, and duration of physical activity. However, the time of day when the physical activity should be performed is not mentioned in any of the recommendations [6\u20138]. Various physiological functions are influenced by the time of day, such as core body temperature [9, 10], cardiovascular functions [11], respiratory control [12], endocrine factors [13\u201315], as well as subjective alertness [16], and thus might affect physiological adaptations in response to exercise. These variations are partly caused by the influence of the endogenous circadian system, causing endogenous circadian oscillations in biological processes following a cycle of approximately 24\u00a0h, i.e., that persist in the absence of environmental and behavioral cycles such as the dark/light, sleep/wake, and fasting/eating cycles [9, 12, 15\u201317]. Several reviews have discussed evidence for diurnal variations for many performance-related outcomes, with acrophases in the afternoon and evening [18\u201329]. A recent meta-analysis, for example, provided statistical evidence that mean power output in the 30-s Wingate test, jump height, as well as handgrip strength is higher in the late afternoon and early evening as compared to the morning [24]. The underlying mechanisms causing within-day and interindividual variations in peak performance are still unclear and may be due to myriad factors such as habitual exercise time, individual chronotype, sleep, food and caffeine intake, environmental conditions, and the endogenous circadian system [10]. Several reviews that investigated diurnal variations in maximum performance concluded that the time of day when the peak performance is achieved may also be the ideal timing for exercise [18\u201321, 29], with further reviews suggesting that the time of exercise training should coincide with the time of competition to achieve optimal performance improvements [22, 25, 30]. Observational studies found associations between the time of day of exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness [31], as well as the risk of coronary heart disease [31], obesity [32], prostate cancer, and breast cancer [33] suggesting that timing of exercise in fact might matter for improving performance and health outcomes in the long term. However, the results were inconclusive in regard to the ideal timing for exercise, with some studies suggesting morning exercise [32, 33] and some evening exercise [31, 33] to be more beneficial. Furthermore, these observational studies tested association and not causation. Therefore, longitudinal intervention trials are needed where the time of training is experimentally modified and differences in improvements are compared.", "Adherence to recommendations for physical activity leads to a reduction in cardiovascular diseases and reduction in premature mortality in diverse populations [1\u20135].

One review addressed primarily the topic of variation in maximal isometric and isokinetic performance throughout the day and included only a small proportion of studies that examined the long-term effects of exercise training at a specific time of day [25]. The other review was the only systematic review with meta-analysis and investigated the time-of-day specific effect of exercise training on muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy [30]. Thus, no systematic review to date has investigated the influence of exercise timing on health-related outcomes.

In cases of discrepancies, additional researchers were consulted (RR, JQ, FAJLS). To evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies, a modified version of the \u201cCochrane risk of bias tool\u201d [41] was used. The initial 22 criteria of the tool were transformed into 13 merged criteria relating to the topics of \u201cbias arising from the randomization process,\u201d \u201cbias due to deviations from intended interventions,\u201d \u201cbias in measurement of the outcome,\u201d \u201cbias due to missing outcome data,\u201d and \"bias in selection of the reported result.\u201d The criteria and the associated descriptions for assessing the risk of bias are provided in Table\u00a01. All criteria were defined before the data extraction process started. For visualization purpose, the overall bias of each study was categorized as low, medium, or high risk of bias (see Fig.\u00a02). Because most studies did not report effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (see Additional file 1: Table S1\u2014pages 8\u201321), the risk of bias across studies (i.e., publication bias) could not be assessed. Hence, funnel plots were created only for those studies included in the meta-analysis (see Additional file 1: Figure S1\u2014page 22) using the same assumptions to calculate the standardized mean difference as for the meta-analyses.Table 1Risk of bias in individual studiesStudy1.

Note that the specific outcomes examined in the meta-analysis are not presented therein to prevent overlap as they are shown in Figs.\u00a03, 4, and Table S1, discussed below. Additional file 1: Table S1 (see pages 8\u201321) shows the detailed study characteristics and outcomes for all studies. Due to the low number of studies measuring harmonizable outcomes, a meta-analysis was only performed for maximum strength and jump height. The included seven studies for the meta-analysis used the gold standard method (i.e., isokinetic dynamometer and infrared system, respectively) or an appropriate method in addition to the gold standard (i.e., strain gauge and jump meter, respectively) to assess either outcome. When determining bilateral knee extension torque with the isokinetic dynamometer, different velocities and ranges of motion were used adding a layer of complexity. Thereby, participants were instructed to exert maximum voluntary effort with the fixed leg in both the concentric and eccentric phases of the movement pattern. The infrared jump system used in these studies to measure jump height was an Optojump photocell that emitted an infrared light 1\u20132\u00a0mm off the ground. During a squat jump or countermovement jump, the infrared light was disrupted by the participant's feet, causing the device to trigger a timer that could measure flight time and contact time. Due to limited comparability with the main group of studies, those studies that examined children, performed a one-repetition maximum test, or implemented electrostimulation training as an exercise intervention were excluded from the meta-analysis. Because effect sizes were not reported for the individual studies, we computed Cohen\u2019s d to estimate the effect sizes [42, 43] for the individual studies included in the meta-analysis. MeanAM\u2009\u00b1\u2009SDAM and MeanPM\u2009\u00b1\u2009SDPM were defined as the group averages and the standard deviations of the change in the outcome from baseline to the end of the intervention period for the morning training condition and the evening training condition, respectively. To calculate the standard deviations of the change as they were not reported in the individual studies, we assumed a correlation of 0.5 between the baseline and post-intervention values. Effect size of the difference between the two conditions (AM vs. PM training) was defined as the change in outcome from the evening training condition minus the change in outcome from the morning training condition. Thus, positive effect sizes indicate a higher improvement during the intervention period in the evening training condition, whereas negative effect sizes indicate higher improvements during the intervention period in the morning training condition. Because the risk of bias was similar for all studies included in the meta-analysis, no correction was applied to adjust for study quality. However, studies were weighted by sample size with larger sample size giving more weight. A random-effects model was applied to estimate overall Cohen\u2019s d using calculated Cohen\u2019s d from individual studies. Figure\u00a03 shows the forest plots that were used to display and compare estimates across studies. Heterogeneity among studies was estimated by the Cochran Q test and quantified by the I2 statistic with the respective p-value [44]. Because the studies included in the meta-analyses were similar regarding age, sex, fitness level, and health status, no sensitivity or sub-group analyses were performed.Table 2Summary of the main outcomes of individual studiesStudyTime of assessmentPre-interventionPost-interventionPost\u2013preMorning trainingEvening trainingMorning trainingEvening trainingMorning trainingEvening training(\u2206 evening training\u2013\u2206 morning training)(p)(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD)(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD)(mean difference)Anthropometric outcome measures\u00a0Body fat content (%)\u00a0\u00a0Alizadeh et al.

Positive effect sizes indicate a higher improvement during the intervention period in the evening training condition or with congruent training and testing, while negative effect sizes indicate a higher improvement in the morning training condition or with incongruent training and testing", "The study characteristics of the 22 included studies are displayed graphically in Fig.\u00a02, and the main results of these studies are reported in Table 2. Note that the specific outcomes examined in the meta-analysis are not presented therein to prevent overlap as they are shown in Figs.\u00a03, 4, and Table S1, discussed below. Additional file 1: Table S1 (see pages 8\u201321) shows the detailed study characteristics and outcomes for all studies. Due to the low number of studies measuring harmonizable outcomes, a meta-analysis was only performed for maximum strength and jump height. The included seven studies for the meta-analysis used the gold standard method (i.e., isokinetic dynamometer and infrared system, respectively) or an appropriate method in addition to the gold standard (i.e., strain gauge and jump meter, respectively) to assess either outcome. When determining bilateral knee extension torque with the isokinetic dynamometer, different velocities and ranges of motion were used adding a layer of complexity. Thereby, participants were instructed to exert maximum voluntary effort with the fixed leg in both the concentric and eccentric phases of the movement pattern. The infrared jump system used in these studies to measure jump height was an Optojump photocell that emitted an infrared light 1\u20132\u00a0mm off the ground. During a squat jump or countermovement jump, the infrared light was disrupted by the participant's feet, causing the device to trigger a timer that could measure flight time and contact time. Due to limited comparability with the main group of studies, those studies that examined children, performed a one-repetition maximum test, or implemented electrostimulation training as an exercise intervention were excluded from the meta-analysis. Because effect sizes were not reported for the individual studies, we computed Cohen\u2019s d to estimate the effect sizes [42, 43] for the individual studies included in the meta-analysis. MeanAM\u2009\u00b1\u2009SDAM and MeanPM\u2009\u00b1\u2009SDPM were defined as the group averages and the standard deviations of the change in the outcome from baseline to the end of the intervention period for the morning training condition and the evening training condition, respectively. To calculate the standard deviations of the change as they were not reported in the individual studies, we assumed a correlation of 0.5 between the baseline and post-intervention values. Effect size of the difference between the two conditions (AM vs. PM training) was defined as the change in outcome from the evening training condition minus the change in outcome from the morning training condition. Thus, positive effect sizes indicate a higher improvement during the intervention period in the evening training condition, whereas negative effect sizes indicate higher improvements during the intervention period in the morning training condition. Because the risk of bias was similar for all studies included in the meta-analysis, no correction was applied to adjust for study quality. However, studies were weighted by sample size with larger sample size giving more weight. A random-effects model was applied to estimate overall Cohen\u2019s d using calculated Cohen\u2019s d from individual studies. Figure\u00a03 shows the forest plots that were used to display and compare estimates across studies. Heterogeneity among studies was estimated by the Cochran Q test and quantified by the I2 statistic with the respective p-value [44]. Because the studies included in the meta-analyses were similar regarding age, sex, fitness level, and health status, no sensitivity or sub-group analyses were performed.Table 2Summary of the main outcomes of individual studiesStudyTime of assessmentPre-interventionPost-interventionPost\u2013preMorning trainingEvening trainingMorning trainingEvening trainingMorning trainingEvening training(\u2206 evening training\u2013\u2206 morning training)(p)(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD)(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD)(mean difference)Anthropometric outcome measures\u00a0Body fat content (%)\u00a0\u00a0Alizadeh et al.

Positive effect sizes indicate a higher improvement during the intervention period in the evening training condition or with congruent training and testing, while negative effect sizes indicate a higher improvement in the morning training condition or with incongruent training and testing", "The study characteristics of the 22 included studies are displayed graphically in Fig.\u00a02, and the main results of these studies are reported in Table 2. Note that the specific outcomes examined in the meta-analysis are not presented therein to prevent overlap as they are shown in Figs.\u00a03, 4, and Table S1, discussed below. Additional file 1: Table S1 (see pages 8\u201321) shows the detailed study characteristics and outcomes for all studies. Due to the low number of studies measuring harmonizable outcomes, a meta-analysis was only performed for maximum strength and jump height. The included seven studies for the meta-analysis used the gold standard method (i.e., isokinetic dynamometer and infrared system, respectively) or an appropriate method in addition to the gold standard (i.e., strain gauge and jump meter, respectively) to assess either outcome. When determining bilateral knee extension torque with the isokinetic dynamometer, different velocities and ranges of motion were used adding a layer of complexity. Thereby, participants were instructed to exert maximum voluntary effort with the fixed leg in both the concentric and eccentric phases of the movement pattern. The infrared jump system used in these studies to measure jump height was an Optojump photocell that emitted an infrared light 1\u20132\u00a0mm off the ground. During a squat jump or countermovement jump, the infrared light was disrupted by the participant's feet, causing the device to trigger a timer that could measure flight time and contact time. Due to limited comparability with the main group of studies, those studies that examined children, performed a one-repetition maximum test, or implemented electrostimulation training as an exercise intervention were excluded from the meta-analysis. Because effect sizes were not reported for the individual studies, we computed Cohen\u2019s d to estimate the effect sizes [42, 43] for the individual studies included in the meta-analysis. MeanAM\u2009\u00b1\u2009SDAM and MeanPM\u2009\u00b1\u2009SDPM were defined as the group averages and the standard deviations of the change in the outcome from baseline to the end of the intervention period for the morning training condition and the evening training condition, respectively. To calculate the standard deviations of the change as they were not reported in the individual studies, we assumed a correlation of 0.5 between the baseline and post-intervention values. Effect size of the difference between the two conditions (AM vs. PM training) was defined as the change in outcome from the evening training condition minus the change in outcome from the morning training condition. Thus, positive effect sizes indicate a higher improvement during the intervention period in the evening training condition, whereas negative effect sizes indicate higher improvements during the intervention period in the morning training condition. Because the risk of bias was similar for all studies included in the meta-analysis, no correction was applied to adjust for study quality. However, studies were weighted by sample size with larger sample size giving more weight. A random-effects model was applied to estimate overall Cohen\u2019s d using calculated Cohen\u2019s d from individual studies. Figure\u00a03 shows the forest plots that were used to display and compare estimates across studies. Heterogeneity among studies was estimated by the Cochran Q test and quantified by the I2 statistic with the respective p-value [44]. Because the studies included in the meta-analyses were similar regarding age, sex, fitness level, and health status, no sensitivity or sub-group analyses were performed.Table 2Summary of the main outcomes of individual studiesStudyTime of assessmentPre-interventionPost-interventionPost\u2013preMorning trainingEvening trainingMorning trainingEvening trainingMorning trainingEvening training(\u2206 evening training\u2013\u2206 morning training)(p)(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD)(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD)(mean difference)Anthropometric outcome measures\u00a0Body fat content (%)\u00a0\u00a0Alizadeh et al.

The studies differed immensely regarding the outcomes and the methods used to measure them. The anthropometric parameters were measured using a body impedance analyzer, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or a simple digital scale. Aerobic endurance was assessed using VO2max with varying protocols and types of exercise (e.g., cycle ergometer versus treadmill ergometer) and distance during a nine-minute running test or six-minute walking test. Anaerobic power or anaerobic capacity was measured using force\u2013velocity test on a cycle ergometer, short swim test as well as 30-s Wingate tests with an equal duration and resistance over the studies. The muscle groups tested in the studies on strength performance were the extensors and flexors of the knee and elbow. Except for one study measuring elbow flexion/extension, all tests to determine the maximum voluntary contraction investigated the knee extensors. However, the methods of measurement differed between isokinetic and isometric dynamometer, as well as resistance machine with a strain gauge. Moreover, maximal and submaximal strength tests (e.g., one-repetition maximum tests or six-repetition maximum tests, respectively) were also commonly performed in the studies. Jump height was measured by a squat jump and a countermovement jump using different measuring devices, i.e., an infrared jump system and/or a vertical jump meter. For the blood analyses, venous and capillary blood was used to determine the main parameters glucose, insulin, HbA1c, testosterone, cortisol, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides.

As shown by this systematic review, to date only few studies have examined this issue. Due to the heterogeneity in outcomes and populations, it is difficult to draw conclusions. The influence of the time of day of exercise on markers of the glycemic metabolism has been investigated in four studies [54, 62, 64, 72], with all examining fasting blood glucose and two additionally measuring the markers HbA1c and insulin [64, 72]. The strong association of an impaired glucose metabolism with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes [89], a disease that is a leading cause of premature death [90], emphasizes the urgency of improving these markers through optimal planned exercise training.

The study by Brito et al. [52] reported the antihypertensive effect of a 10-week progressive aerobic exercise training on a cycle ergometer in treated hypertensive men. While both the morning and evening training condition lowered their clinical systolic blood pressure values over the intervention period, the evening training condition showed a significantly improved decrease in both morning and evening systolic blood pressure evaluations. A further study [54] similarly showed a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure values in the evening training condition compared with the morning training condition after a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention in inactive, overweight adults. A possible explanation for the greater reduction in systolic blood pressure in the evening training condition in the study by Brito et al. [52] could be the consumption of antihypertensive drugs. All subjects in this study took medication in the morning and about 50% additionally in the evening. It is known that the antihypertensive effect of aerobic exercise is less pronounced when blood pressure levels are lower [101]. Therefore, the participants exercising in the morning trained under the highest effect of antihypertensive drugs during the intervention period and may have experienced lower adaptations as a consequence. However, to confirm this assumption, a clear documentation of individual blood pressure values prior to each training session is required. An improved antihypertensive effect of aerobic exercise in subjects with higher blood pressure levels may also account for the improved decrease in systolic blood pressure that occurred in the evening training condition in the study by Brooker et al. [54]. In this study, the evening training condition already had a 16\u00a0mmHg higher resting systolic blood pressure at baseline and therefore trained at higher values than the morning training condition. However, it should be noted that no statistical calculations were performed in this study, and thus, with respect to baseline differences, the conditions were not tested for differences and the results were not adjusted, making it impossible to draw a conclusion based on the collected data and results. Another reason for an impact of the time of day of exercise training on the reduction in blood pressure could be the post-exercise antihypertensive effect, which varies by the time of day. It was shown that in normotensive physically active men, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial blood pressure acutely decreased more after 30\u00a0min of endurance training at 70% VO2peak in the late afternoon than after the identical exercise training in the early morning [102].", "The effect of exercise training at a certain time of day was also investigated for the health outcome blood pressure.

However, it should be noted that no statistical calculations were performed in this study, and thus, with respect to baseline differences, the conditions were not tested for differences and the results were not adjusted, making it impossible to draw a conclusion based on the collected data and results. Another reason for an impact of the time of day of exercise training on the reduction in blood pressure could be the post-exercise antihypertensive effect, which varies by the time of day. It was shown that in normotensive physically active men, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial blood pressure acutely decreased more after 30\u00a0min of endurance training at 70% VO2peak in the late afternoon than after the identical exercise training in the early morning [102].", "The effect of exercise training at a certain time of day was also investigated for the health outcome blood pressure. The study by Brito et al. [52] reported the antihypertensive effect of a 10-week progressive aerobic exercise training on a cycle ergometer in treated hypertensive men. While both the morning and evening training condition lowered their clinical systolic blood pressure values over the intervention period, the evening training condition showed a significantly improved decrease in both morning and evening systolic blood pressure evaluations. A further study [54] similarly showed a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure values in the evening training condition compared with the morning training condition after a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention in inactive, overweight adults. A possible explanation for the greater reduction in systolic blood pressure in the evening training condition in the study by Brito et al. [52] could be the consumption of antihypertensive drugs. All subjects in this study took medication in the morning and about 50% additionally in the evening. It is known that the antihypertensive effect of aerobic exercise is less pronounced when blood pressure levels are lower [101]. Therefore, the participants exercising in the morning trained under the highest effect of antihypertensive drugs during the intervention period and may have experienced lower adaptations as a consequence. However, to confirm this assumption, a clear documentation of individual blood pressure values prior to each training session is required. An improved antihypertensive effect of aerobic exercise in subjects with higher blood pressure levels may also account for the improved decrease in systolic blood pressure that occurred in the evening training condition in the study by Brooker et al. [54]. In this study, the evening training condition already had a 16\u00a0mmHg higher resting systolic blood pressure at baseline and therefore trained at higher values than the morning training condition.

Further, body core temperature is linked to an improvement in metabolic responses, an increase in connective tissue extensibility, an increase in action potential conduction velocity, a reduction in muscle viscosity [106, 107], an enhanced rate of carbohydrate over fat utilization [108], and encouragement of actin-myosin crossbridge mechanics within the musculoskeletal unit [108].

Furthermore, it seems that the time at which individuals habitually exercise also has an impact on physical performance [78] and this could lead to interindividual differences in the increase in performance during the intervention studies.", "Recommendations for Future Studies Investigating the Exercise Time of Day on Performance-Related and Health-Related Outcomes and Perspectives", "Recommendations for Future Studies Investigating the Exercise Time of Day on Performance-Related and Health-Related Outcomes and Perspectives", "Recommendations for Future Studies Investigating the Exercise Time of Day on Performance-Related and Health-Related Outcomes and Perspectives", "To generate solid data regarding the time-of-day specific effect of exercise on performance-related and health-related outcomes, further studies with a rigorous methodological approach are needed. We recommend consideration of the following in future studies: (1) inclusion of different populations such as with regard to sex, age, health status, and chronotype to increase generalization, (2) an a priori calculation of the sample size for the primary outcome and statistical adjustment for testing of multiple outcomes, (3) reporting mean differences and effect sizes including 95% confidence intervals for each outcome, and (4) using the gold standard methods to assess each outcome. More detailed recommendations for assessing the performance and baseline and post-intervention can be found in the review by Knaier et al. [24]. Further, we recommend: (5) monitoring of sleep patterns, dietary habits, and unsupervised physical activity with objective methods during the entire intervention period to control for possible confounders. While monitoring of sleep and physical activity with objective methods (primarily wearables) is common these days, there is ongoing discussion about the feasibility of long-term monitoring of dietary habits. One approach for objective monitoring is the remote food photography method, which has shown good feasibility and compliance with just a slight underestimation of energy intake in a free-living setting [122\u2013125]. Furthermore, continuous interstitial glucose monitoring shows promise in validating reported timing of meals [126]. A rigorous monitoring of these behaviors is essential to address another research question that we think is important. We recommend that future studies should address the interaction between the three pillars of health: nutrition, sleep, and physical activity. Because the main focus of research on the effects of exercise timing has been on performance-related outcomes, to this date, there is a paucity of studies investigating the effects of exercise timing on health-related outcomes. Finally, to provide a more holistic understanding of contributing factors to diurnal variation, additional physiological markers, such as blood parameters, body temperature, or muscle clocks, need to be examined.", "To generate solid data regarding the time-of-day specific effect of exercise on performance-related and health-related outcomes, further studies with a rigorous methodological approach are needed.

However, there is some evidence that there is a benefit when training and testing occurs at the same time of day for performance-related outcomes. At this time, there is insufficient evidence to expand the current training recommendations containing the factors frequency, intensity, type, and time (duration), with the factor time of day of exercise. Nevertheless, the current data clearly indicate that the time of day is not irrelevant and warrants further investigation with a rigorous methodological approach, a broader study population, and adequate controlling and monitoring of all confounding factors.", "There is little evidence for or against the hypothesis that training at a certain time of day is more beneficial in terms of performance-related and health-related outcomes compared to another time of day.
