Gentamicin C complex in particular is remarkably potent in treating systemic Gram-negative infections, and semisynthetic gentamicins that combat pathogen resistance or show reduced toxicity remain attractive goals. We report here the roles of clustered genes and enzymes that define a methylation network in gentamicin biosynthesis and also identify a remote gene on the chromosome encoding the essential methyltransferase GenL, which is decisive for the proportions of the five major components present in the gentamicin C complex. This is an important step toward engineered fermentation to produce single components as valuable starting materials for semisynthesis of next-generation aminoglycoside antibiotics.", "Gentamicin C complex from Micromonospora echinospora remains a globally important antibiotic, and there is revived interest in the semisynthesis of analogs that might show improved therapeutic properties. The complex consists of five components differing in their methylation pattern at one or more sites in the molecule. We show here, using specific gene deletion and chemical complementation, that the gentamicin pathway up to the branch point is defined by the selectivity of the methyltransferases GenN, GenD1, and GenK. Unexpectedly, they comprise a methylation network in which early intermediates are ectopically modified. Using whole-genome sequence, we have also discovered the terminal 6\u2032-N-methyltransfer required to produce gentamicin C2b from C1a or gentamicin C1 from C2, an example of an essential biosynthetic enzyme being located not in the biosynthetic gene cluster but far removed on the chromosome. These findings fully account for the methylation pattern in gentamicins and open the way to production of individual gentamicins by fermentation, as starting materials for semisynthesis.", "Gentamicins are clinically valuable aminoglycoside antibiotics isolated as gentamicin C complex, a mixture of five components (Fig. 1), from the filamentous bacterium Micromonospora echinospora. Gentamicins are protein synthesis inhibitors used to combat Gram-negative bacterial infections. They are also being actively explored for use in other applications (1\u20133). However, gentamicins carry a serious risk of kidney damage and irreversible hearing loss (4, 5), which limits their utility. Encouragingly, individual components of the gentamicin mixture may have lower toxicity (6, 7). Individual components of gentamicin C can already be separated after manual chemical derivatization (8), but achieving this by low-cost direct fermentation would significantly advance interest in single components both as starting material for semisynthesis to novel gentamicins and for testing as therapeutics in their own right.", "Fig. 1.Methyltransfer reactions in gentamicin biosynthetic pathway.

The enzymatic steps that lead to the 2-DOS scaffold, and thence to the pseudodisaccharide paromamine (11\u201313) and the pseudotrisaccharide gentamicin A2 (1) (14) (Fig. 1), have all been elucidated, and more recently rapid progress has also been made in delineating the later steps of gentamicin biosynthesis, greatly aided by the sequencing of the gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster (15\u201317) and the related sisomicin cluster (18). We have previously used a combination of genetic and biochemical evidence to reveal that, starting from the intermediate 3\u2033-dehydro-3\u2033-oxo-gentamicin A2 (DAA2) (2) (Fig. 1), the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase GenN catalyzes 3\u2032\u2032-N-methylation, followed by 4\u2033-C-methylation catalyzed by a cobalamin- and radical SAM-dependent methyltransferase GenD1, to form gentamicin X2 (4) (19). In the same way, we (20) and others (21\u201324) have shown that a second cobalamin- and radical SAM-dependent methyltransferase, GenK, catalyzes 6\u2032-C-methylation of gentamicin X2 (4) to initiate the branch of the gentamicin pathway that leads via G418 (5) to gentamicin components C2a, C2, and C1. The full mechanistic details of the subsequent transamination and dehydroxylation steps remain to be clarified, although the dehydrogenase GenQ (20), phosphotransferase GenP, and the pyridoxal-dependent enzymes GenB1, GenB2, GenB3, and GenB4 have all been implicated in this enigmatic process (20, 25, 26). Finally, the terminal step in both branches of the pathway involves the (partial) conversion of C1a into C2b and of C2 into C1, catalyzed by an unidentified 6\u2032-N-methyltransferase (or possibly two different methyltransferases). Given the decisive role of methylation in shaping the pathway to the gentamicin C complex, we have used mutant strains of M. echinospora engineered to contain different complements of GenN, GenD1, and GenK to investigate the substrate selectivity of these known methyltransferases to determine the scope for altering the methylation pattern; and we have tracked down and identified, by combined biochemical and genetic approaches, the terminal methyltransferase (named GenL). GenL is located on its own 2.54 Mbp from the previously characterized gentamicin gene cluster. We show that GenL is necessary and sufficient to catalyze the 6\u2032-N-methylation of both C2 and C1a. It follows that future judicious manipulation of the levels of (in particular) GenK and GenL activity in cells should permit targeted enrichment of individual components of the gentamicin C complex.", "Results", "Results", "Systematic Deletion of One or More of the Methyltransferase Genes genN, genD1, and genK Reveals Alternative Minor Pathways for Methylation.", "Systematic Deletion of One or More of the Methyltransferase Genes genN, genD1, and genK Reveals Alternative Minor Pathways for Methylation.", "Systematic Deletion of One or More of the Methyltransferase Genes genN, genD1, and genK Reveals Alternative Minor Pathways for Methylation.", "Commercial samples of gentamicin C complex obtained by fermentation contain variable amounts of minor gentamicin metabolites as impurities.

The results presented here significantly advance our understanding of the way in which methylation shapes the branched biosynthetic pathway to the gentamicin C complex, an established drug used to combat serious infections. These insights are key to the success of efforts to redirect the course of biosynthesis toward specific components of the complex and give an appreciation of the scope for altering the methylation pattern on the gentamicin pseudotrisaccharide scaffold to generate various metabolites for testing as antibiotics or for other therapeutic indications (3). Methyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of natural products have considerable potential for the engineering of new derivatives (33\u201335). There is renewed interest in aminoglycoside antibiotics (3, 36) driven in part by the increasing incidence of pathogenic strains resistant to many other antibiotics but also by encouraging evidence that toxicity and vulnerability to resistance mechanisms can be ameliorated by semisynthesis (37). For example, etimicin is prepared from gentamicin C1a (38) and plazomicin (currently in phase III trials) from the gentamicin-like sisomicin (39). If the single components of the gentamicin C complex can be efficiently prepared by low-cost direct fermentation, it will widen the scope for such efforts.", "Methylation is an important reaction in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites in both plants and microorganisms, where it contributes significantly to the chemical diversity of the products (31, 32).

Further insight into methyltransferase substrate specificity was gained by feeding these individual metabolites to strains of M. echinospora stripped of the resident gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster, except for a resistance gene and genN, genD1, or genK. The results showed that GenK and GenD1 are somewhat more versatile than GenN in accepting alternative substrates (Fig. 3). Even so, 6 is not a substrate for either GenK or GenN, so 10 must be formed via 7, and since 10 is not a substrate for GenN, neither 6 nor 10 are competent intermediates in biosynthesis of the gentamicin C complex. Thus, the only minor alternative pathways that can contribute to production of the gentamicin C complex lead from 3 to 9 to 5, inverting the normal order in which GenD1 and GenK act, or from 2 to 7 to 9 to 5, if GenK acts before GenN and GenD1 (Fig. 1). Agar diffusion assays against Bacillus pumilis showed that, with the important exception of the natural intermediate X2, derivatives tested that lacked any of the core methylations of the gentamicin C complex were essentially inactive (SI Appendix, Fig. S7), emphasizing the importance of both the pattern and the extent of this modification for antibiotic activity. The relatively tight selectivity of the three methyltransferases rationalizes why the conventional pathway dominates in the wild type. Although these results provide proof of concept for directing biosynthesis toward gentamicin-related metabolites with altered methylation patterns, enzyme engineering to modify substrate specificity would be required to make this an efficient process, and further modification of those templates would be required to restore antibiotic activity.", "Purification of the intermediates accumulated in these mutants also provided a panel of gentamicin metabolites.

This was previously annotated as an orphan methyltransferase, along with many other similar genes in M. echinospora, and it is not located near any recognizable genes of specialized metabolism.

Whether GenL also catalyzes a different reaction in primary or specialized metabolism is unknown. We have characterized recombinant GenL as a homodimeric SAM-dependent enzyme with exactly the expected substrate specificity. GenL showed no activity against earlier intermediates in the pathway.
