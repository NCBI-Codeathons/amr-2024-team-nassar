["Much recent interest has arisen in investigating Streptomyces isolates derived from the marine environment in the search for new bioactive compounds, particularly those found in association with marine invertebrates, such as sponges. Among these new compounds recently identified from marine Streptomyces isolates are the octapeptidic surugamides, which have been shown to possess anticancer and antifungal activities. By employing genome mining followed by an one strain many compounds (OSMAC)-based approach, we have identified the previously unreported capability of a marine sponge-derived isolate, namely Streptomyces sp. SM17, to produce surugamide A. Phylogenomics analyses provided novel insights on the distribution and conservation of the surugamides biosynthetic gene cluster (sur BGC) and suggested a closer relatedness between marine-derived sur BGCs than their terrestrially derived counterparts. Subsequent analysis showed differential production of surugamide A when comparing the closely related marine and terrestrial isolates, namely Streptomyces sp. SM17 and Streptomyces albidoflavus J1074. SM17 produced higher levels of surugamide A than S. albidoflavus J1074 under all conditions tested, and in particular producing >13-fold higher levels when grown in YD and 3-fold higher levels in SYP-NaCl medium. In addition, surugamide A production was repressed in TSB and YD medium, suggesting that carbon catabolite repression (CCR) may influence the production of surugamides in these strains.", "1. Introduction", "1. Introduction", "Members of the Streptomyces genus are widely known to be prolific producers of natural products. Many of these compounds have found widespread use in the pharmaceutical industry as antibiotics, immunosuppressant, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-parasitic drugs [1]. However, there continues to be an urgent need to discover new bioactive compounds, and especially antibiotics, primarily due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in clinically important bacterial pathogens [2,3]. In particular, the increase in multi-resistant ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) has focused research efforts to develop new antibiotics to treat these priority antibiotic-resistant bacteria [4].", "Members of the Streptomyces genus are widely known to be prolific producers of natural products.

Marine sponges are known to host a variety of different bacteria and fungi, which produce a diverse range of natural products, including compounds with antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antibacterial, and anticancer activities [5,6]. Marine sponge-associated Streptomyces spp. are a particularly important source of bioactive compounds, with examples including Streptomyces sp. HB202, isolated from the sponge Halichondria panicea, which produces mayamycin, a compound with activity against Staphylococcus aureus [7]; and streptophenazines G and K, with activity against Bacillus subtilis [8]; together with Streptomyces sp.

Additionally, our group has reported the production of antimycins from Streptomyces sp. SM8 isolated from the sponge Haliclona simulans, with antifungal and antibacterial activities [10,11]. In further work, we genetically characterised 13 Streptomyces spp. that were isolated from both shallow and deep-sea sponges, which displayed antimicrobial activities against a number of clinically relevant bacterial and yeast species [12,13].

As previously mentioned, genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the sur BGC indicated similarities between those BGCs belonging to aquatic saline-derived Streptomyces isolates (Figure 5), together with the likelihood that these sur BGCs might have had a common origin. Thus, it is plausible that this origin may have been marine, and hence the presence of salts in the growth medium may also have an influence on the biosynthesis of surugamide A. Different concentrations of salts in the form of NaCl in the culture medium have also previously been shown to impact on the chemical profile of metabolites produced in the marine-obligate bacteria Salinispora arenicola [87].", "Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe that, despite the repression/induction of the biosynthesis of surugamide A observed when different media were employed, the SM17 isolate clearly produces considerably higher amounts of surugamide A when compared to S. albidoflavus J1074\u2014reaching yields up to >13-fold higher in the YD medium, and around 3-fold higher when grown in the SYP-NaCl medium (Table 1).", "Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe that, despite the repression/induction of the biosynthesis of surugamide A observed when different media were employed, the SM17 isolate clearly produces considerably higher amounts of surugamide A when compared to S. albidoflavus J1074\u2014reaching yields up to >13-fold higher in the YD medium, and around 3-fold higher when grown in the SYP-NaCl medium (Table 1).", "Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe that, despite the repression/induction of the biosynthesis of surugamide A observed when different media were employed, the SM17 isolate clearly produces considerably higher amounts of surugamide A when compared to S. albidoflavus J1074\u2014reaching yields up to >13-fold higher in the YD medium, and around 3-fold higher when grown in the SYP-NaCl medium (Table 1).", "4.

Conclusions", "Marine-derived bacteria, particularly those isolated in association with marine invertebrates, such as sponges, have been shown to be reservoirs of bioactive molecules, including those with antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities.

SM17 to produce surugamide A and also sheds new light on factors such as the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) that may be involved in regulating production of this molecule. Phylogenomics analysis indicated that the sur BGC is commonly present in members of the proposed albidoflavus phylogroup, and that the sur BGCs present in different isolates derived from varied environmental niches may possess a common ancestry. Although high quality genomic data from this proposed albidoflavus phylogroup are still lacking, results presented here suggest that the sur BGCs derived from Streptomyces isolated from aquatic saline environment are more similar to each other, when compared to those isolated from terrestrial environments.", "Based on genome mining, this study identified the previously unreported capability of the marine sponge-derived isolate Streptomyces sp.

This analysis showed that not only the marine-derived isolate SM17 was capable of producing more surugamide A when compared to J1074 under all the conditions tested, but also that the biosynthesis of surugamide A is likely to be influenced by the CCR, and potentially by the presence of salts in the growth medium. These results also highlight the importance of employing an OSMAC-based approach even when analysing the production of known compounds, since there is a clear difference in the yields of surugamide A obtained when employing different culture media. Thus, it is possible to gain further insights into the production of bacterial types of compounds by 1) discovering strains that possess a higher capability to produce these compounds; 2) establishing optimal conditions for the biosynthesis of their production; and 3) providing a better understanding of the genetic and regulatory mechanisms potentially underpinning the production of these compounds.", "Chemical analysis was performed in order to assess differential production of surugamide A when comparing a marine Streptomyces isolate with a terrestrial Streptomyces isolate, namely SM17 and J1074 strains, respectively, following an OSMAC-based approach employing different culture media.
