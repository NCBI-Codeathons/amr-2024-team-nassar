Qureshi, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia", "The rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens poses a significant challenge to the field of infectious disease treatment. To overcome this problem, novel strategies are being explored to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics. Antibiotic adjuvants have emerged as a promising approach to combat MDR pathogens by acting synergistically with antibiotics. This review focuses on the role of antibiotic adjuvants as a synergistic tool in the fight against MDR pathogens. Adjuvants refer to compounds or agents that enhance the activity of antibiotics, either by potentiating their effects or by targeting the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. The utilization of antibiotic adjuvants offers several advantages. Firstly, they can restore the effectiveness of existing antibiotics against resistant strains. Adjuvants can inhibit the mechanisms that confer resistance, making the pathogens susceptible to the action of antibiotics. Secondly, adjuvants can enhance the activity of antibiotics by improving their penetration into bacterial cells, increasing their stability, or inhibiting efflux pumps that expel antibiotics from bacterial cells. Various types of antibiotic adjuvants have been investigated, including efflux pump inhibitors, resistance-modifying agents, and compounds that disrupt bacterial biofilms. These adjuvants can act synergistically with antibiotics, resulting in increased antibacterial activity and overcoming resistance mechanisms. In conclusion, antibiotic adjuvants have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of MDR pathogens. By enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics, adjuvants offer a promising strategy to combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Further research and development in this field are crucial to harness the full potential of antibiotic adjuvants and bring them closer to clinical application.", "Introduction", "Introduction", "The evolution and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a matter of global health concern in the 21st century. A WHO report of 2017 identifies ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) as critical-priority pathogenic bacteria causing fatal antibiotic resistance (Tacconelli et\u00a0al., 2018). The emergence and spread of MDR pathogens pose a significant threat to public health worldwide. Multi-drug resistance is a complex and multifaceted problem. MDR occurs due to various factors, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics such as unnecessary prescriptions, inappropriate dosages, incomplete or prolonged treatment courses, a lack of proper and quick diagnostic measures (Cant\u00f3n et\u00a0al., 2013), inadequate infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities, poor adherence to hygiene, a lack of sanitation (Chinemerem Nwobodo et\u00a0al., 2022), and the genetic adaptability of microbial species. Furthermore, routine use of antibiotics in livestock production and in farming and agriculture facilitates the emergence of drug-resistant strains that can spread to humans via the food web or chain (Aslam et\u00a0al., 2021).", "The evolution and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a matter of global health concern in the 21st century.

Mechanisms which collectively contribute to the reduced susceptibility of drug-resistant pathogens to conventional antibiotics are: 1) production of enzymes like \u03b2-lactamases, which break down the molecular structure of antibiotics to render them inactive, is a crucial strategy utilized by the pathogens (Egorov et\u00a0al., 2018); 2) development of efflux pumps by drug-resistant bacteria to actively expel antibiotics and reduce their concentration in their cells; 3) modification of antibiotic target site; 4) enzymatic inactivation due to bacterial mutations causing production of altered ribosomes or enzymes which can diminish the binding affinity of antibiotics rendering them ineffective (Munita & Arias, 2016). The continuous selective pressure exerted by antibiotics has led to the evolution and dissemination of resistant strains, rendering many commonly used antibiotics ineffective (Davies & Davies, 2010). Consequently, infections caused by these drug-resistant pathogens are associated with higher mortality rates in vulnerable populations. Also lead to increased healthcare costs, prolonged hospital stays, and consuming more resources, resulting in the loss of productivity and necessitating high-acuity care. In recent years, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) bacteria has further exacerbated the crisis, leaving clinicians with limited or no treatment options (Struelens, 1998; Ozma et\u00a0al., 2022).

Adjuvants are compounds or substances that are co-administered with antibiotics to enhance their antimicrobial activity. This can be achieved by either directly inhibiting bacterial resistance mechanisms or by potentiating the effects of antibiotics (Gill et\u00a0al., 2015). The use of antibiotic adjuvants to resist AMR has potential advantages over the development of entirely new antibiotics. Adjuvants can effectively enhance the potency of existing antibiotics. This is made possible by lowering the minimum inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic required to kill the bacteria and allowing for the preservation of currently available treatment options (Melander and Melander, 2017; Laws et\u00a0al., 2019). Repurposing the antibacterial compounds rendered obsolete (Schweizer, 2019), (Boyd et\u00a0al., 2021) opens up the possibility of developing numerous analogues as antibiotic adjuvants. Moreover, the combination of adjuvants with antibiotics has the potential to reduce the rates of bacterial mutations, which has the potential to slow the development of resistance because of the well-conserved putative bacterial target (Allen & Brown, 2019). This approach represents a synergistic strategy where the combined effect of the adjuvant and the antibiotic is greater than the sum of their individual effects (Gill et\u00a0al., 2015). AAs are resistant to antibiotics due to their unique mechanism (Annunziato, 2019), and most importantly, there is no selection pressure as the compounds are nonantibiotic in nature (Melander & Melander, 2017). The antibiotic adjuvant strategy also has certain limitations, like the identification of compounds or substances with essential physicochemical properties that can be used as adjuvants and co-administered with antibiotics, which is a daunting task. Additionally, the drug-drug interactions between antibiotics and adjuvants need to be assessed to avoid deleterious effects. Moreover, to facilitate an efficient co-dosing regimen with optimal spatial and temporal delivery options, adjuvants and antibiotics must have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that are compatible with one another.

PMF is an electro chemical proton gradient governed by the electric potential (\u0394\u03a8) and the proton gradient (\u0394pH). A balance is maintained between these two components to have stable PMF levels (Farha et\u00a0al., 2013). PMF is the driving force required for ATP synthesis in bacterial cell, it also powers bacterial cell motility and cell division (Lee et\u00a0al., 2023). PMF is essential for entry of weakly charged and amphiphilic particles into cytosol. Tetracyclines and loperamide penetrate bacterial cell in a \u0394pH-dependent manner, however, loperamide dissipates the electric potential (\u0394\u03a8) of PMF. As a counter regulatory mechanism to maintain PMF maintain and ATP synthesis levels, bacteria increase the transmembrane proton gradient (\u0394pH) in the cell which in turn enhances the uptake of tetracycline. In contrast, aminoglycoside uptake is \u0394\u03a8 dependent, explaining the antagonistic effect between loperamide and aminoglycosides (Ejim et\u00a0al., 2011). Polymyxin inhibits \u0394\u03a8 and alters membrane permeability by disrupting LPS structure. PMF inhibitors e.g., thioridazine, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, trifluoperazine, gossypol, amitriptyline and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP),antibiotic hybrids were found to eliminate MRSA cells by disrupting PMF by exhausting either \u0394\u03a8 or \u0394pH (Mohiuddin et\u00a0al., 2022).", "Biofilm inhibitors", "Biofilm inhibitors", "Biofilm inhibitors", "Bacterial growth adaptations against stress, desiccation, the oxidizing effects of chemicals, and the host\u2019s immune system led to the development of bacterial biofilms.

The second step involves the aggregation and colonization of single-seeded cells. Subsequently, growth and cell division of seeded bacterial cells occur, during which they secrete EPS that offers structural rigidity and release chemicals called quoromones (quorum sensing molecules), responsible for bacterial cell communication and controlling the gene expression of the biofilm. Cell division and aggregation/colonization occur until there is a significant increase in the cell density in the biofilms. This is called the maturation phase. This mature biofilm structure is responsible for antibiotic resistance. In this stage, the EPS restricts the movement of substances and increases toxic buildup, due to which the bacteria get activated. Subsequently, they secrete EPS-digesting hydrolases, which help dissolve EPS around them and release the planktic bacterial cells, which can seed into new colonies (Luo et\u00a0al., 2021).

The EPS is a sticky layer that acts as a natural defense, shielding the bacteria against stressful conditions and chemicals. Its composition is also varied. EPS delays diffusion, decreases the rate of drug penetration, and blocks the entry of certain chemicals, thereby enhancing resistance to antibiotics. The microenvironment inside the biofilm is intriguing and prone to change. At different strata, it has different chemistry; deep inside, metabolic wastes and nutrients are accumulated. It becomes more anaerobic in nature, which is not favored by antibiotics. Some of the bacteria turn into spore-like dormant forms called \u2018Persister cells (Abebe, 2020).

They can be termed \u201cimmune enhancers.\u201d The host defense mechanisms being targeted include: i) regulating pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathways. e.g., 4C-Staph/T7-alum vaccine containing a TLR7-agonist (SMIP.7-10) and T7-alum adjuvant was found efficient to treat peritonitis in mice caused by staphylococcal strains (Bagnoli et\u00a0al., 2015; Mancini et\u00a0al., 2016); ii) enhancing the autophagy activity through the use of P38 and cathepsin B inhibitors. (C) Stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF \u03b1). HIF-1\u03b1 is a key regulator of the immune response. Augmentation of HIF levels might enhance antimicrobial activities and boost infection clearance in the majority of infections. Contrastingly, some microorganisms, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania, thrive well when HIF levels are enhanced. Zinkernagel et\u00a0al. (2008) reported that mimosine augments HIF-1\u03b1, which enhances the bactericidal activity of phagocytes. Similarly, it was found that HIF-1\u03b1 stabilizing agent AKB-4924 reduced uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) bladder infection in mice by 10-fold; it was found to be efficient in killing Acinitobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and limiting S. aureus in a skin abscess model in mice (Okumura et\u00a0al., 2012). (D) regulating ROS and RNS production. ROS-inducing strategies like antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) enhance microbial eradication used to treat wounds and in food contamination cases (Li et\u00a0al., 2021). Alternatively, antibiotics, when combined with antimicrobial peptides, show synergistic effects and enhance antimicrobial activity. Haisma et\u00a0al. (2014) demonstrated that peptides of human cathelicidin LL-37 and its derivatives, such as P60.4Ac and peptide 10 (P10), were efficient antibiofilm agents and could efficiently eradicate multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and mupirocin MRSA from burn wounds without altering the viability of the host keratinocytes. Another example is that of BAY 11-7082 (BAY, an inhibitor of IkB\u03b1 kinase), which inhibits nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) activation, which could in turn enhance macrophage apoptosis and autophagy, which are essential for pathogenic clearance and killing intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) (Bai et\u00a0al., 2013). However, care must be taken while using immune enhancers, as overstimulation of the immune system can lead to deleterious effects on the host.", "Finally, it is plausible to conclude that antibiotic adjuvants are crucial, with significant clinical ramifications in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. They can be a valuable addition to the arsenal of existing antibiotics due to their ability to enhance antibiotic efficacy, prevent biofilm formation, provide alternative strategies to overcome resistance, and prevent its further development.

The current study on antibiotic adjuvants opens up several avenues for future research and further directions. Here are some potential areas to explore: Adjuvant Development: With the rise of antibiotic resistance posing a significant threat to public health, the development of new strategies to enhance the efficacy of existing antibiotics is crucial. Adjuvants offer a unique approach by targeting the underlying mechanisms that contribute to antibiotic resistance and working in synergy with antibiotics to overcome these challenges. Continued research and development of adjuvants is crucial. Investigating new adjuvant compounds or modifying existing ones to improve their efficacy, safety, and specificity can lead to the discovery of more potent adjuvants. Understanding the mechanisms of action and identifying new targets for adjuvants can further enhance their ability to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens. Mechanism Elucidation of adjuvants: one of the key advantages of antibiotic adjuvants is their ability to reverse or suppress antibiotic resistance mechanisms in bacteria. Adjuvants can inhibit efflux pumps, enzymes, or biofilm formation, which are common strategies employed by bacteria to resist the effects of antibiotics. By blocking these resistance mechanisms, adjuvants can restore the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics, allowing the drugs to once again effectively kill the pathogens. Another important aspect of antibiotic adjuvants is their potential to target bacterial virulence factors. Unlike antibiotics that primarily target bacterial growth and survival, adjuvants can interfere with the mechanisms that enable bacteria to cause harm to the host. By inhibiting virulence factors such as toxin production or adhesion to host tissues, adjuvants can attenuate the pathogenicity of bacteria, allowing the host\u2019s immune system and antibiotics to more effectively clear the infection. Gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which adjuvants overcome antibiotic resistance is essential. This knowledge offers a significant advantage over developing entirely new antibiotics or adjuvants with tailored mechanisms of action for different resistance mechanisms or bacterial species. Furthermore, antibiotic adjuvants have demonstrated the ability to enhance the activity of antibiotics through synergistic interactions. Adjuvants can potentiate the effects of antibiotics by increasing their uptake into bacterial cells, improving their binding to targets, or interfering with bacterial defense systems. This synergistic effect not only improves the overall efficacy of antibiotics but also helps to overcome the development of resistance. Combination Strategies: By using adjuvants in combination with antibiotics, lower doses of antibiotics can be used, reducing the likelihood of resistance emergence. Investigating the potential of combining adjuvants with other therapeutic approaches, such as phage therapy, immunotherapy, or host-directed therapies, is a promising direction. Understanding the synergistic effects and potential interactions between adjuvants and alternative therapies can provide valuable strategies for combating multidrug-resistant pathogens. In vivo studies: Identifying adjuvants with high specificity and low toxicity is essential to ensuring their safety and efficacy. Additionally, the optimization of adjuvant-antibiotic combinations requires extensive research, both preclinical and clinical trials in animal and human models, to determine the most effective strategies for different pathogens and resistance mechanisms. Clinical implementation: Translating the use of adjuvants into clinical settings is a crucial step. Real-world studies can provide data related to cost effectiveness, feasibility, toxicity, etc., which can provide protocols necessary for their usage in clinical settings. However, it is worth noting that the development and implementation of antibiotic adjuvants face certain challenges like lack of proper research, insufficient funds, rapidly growing resistant strains, etc. Despite these challenges, antibiotic adjuvants hold great potential for combating MDR pathogens. They offer a multifaceted approach by targeting resistance mechanisms, enhancing antibiotic activity, and attenuating bacterial virulence. The integration of adjuvants into existing antibiotic treatment regimens could revitalize the efficacy of currently available antibiotics, prolong their lifespan, and provide an essential tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Moving forward, continued research and development in the field of antibiotic adjuvants are crucial. Collaborations between scientists, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies are necessary to identify and optimize adjuvants that can be successfully translated into clinical practice. Additionally, regulatory agencies play a vital role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of adjuvants and providing guidelines for their appropriate use.", "Antibiotic adjuvants represent a promising and synergistic tool in the battle against MDR pathogens.
