["Bacterial genome sequencing has revealed a vast number of novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) with potential to produce bioactive natural products. However, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by bacteria is often silenced under laboratory conditions, limiting the controlled expression of natural products. Here we describe an integrated methodology for the construction and screening of an elicited and pre-fractionated library of marine bacteria. In this pilot study, chemical elicitors were evaluated to mimic the natural environment and to induce the expression of cryptic BGCs in deep-sea bacteria. By integrating high-resolution untargeted metabolomics with cheminformatics analyses, it was possible to visualize, mine, identify and map the chemical and biological space of the elicited bacterial metabolites. The results show that elicited bacterial metabolites correspond to ~45% of the compounds produced under laboratory conditions. In addition, the elicited chemical space is novel (~70% of the elicited compounds) or concentrated in the chemical space of drugs. Fractionation of the crude extracts further evidenced minor compounds (~90% of the collection) and the detection of biological activity. This pilot work pinpoints strategies for constructing and evaluating chemically diverse bacterial natural product libraries towards the identification of novel bacterial metabolites in natural product-based drug discovery pipelines.", "1. Introduction", "1.

Notably, secondary metabolites are important sources of chemical diversity for drug discovery and development [2].", "Ecologically, secondary metabolites are involved in the adaptive processes of species, interacting effectively and specifically with their biological targets [1,2]. Microorganisms, especially bacteria and fungi, are sources of a vast chemical diversity of metabolites, due to their constant interaction with widely colonized areas, which are competitive habitats under constant stress [3]. To increase survival rates under these conditions, microorganisms adopt several strategies, such as the production of secondary metabolites to counteract physicochemical changes in the environment (e.g., pigments), as well as bioactive secondary metabolites to combat their competitors in their native habitat. Examples of such metabolites are penicillin and epoxyketone peptides. The first, produced by fungi of the genera Penicillium, is induced in the presence of a bacteria, combating these competitors by covalently inhibiting Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs), many of which are essential for bacterial cell-wall synthesis and stability [4]. Beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, are one of the main classes of antibacterial agents used by humanity. On the other hand, the epoxyketone peptides eponemycin [5] and epoxomicin [6] are produced by actinomycete bacteria, selectively binding to the active sites of the proteasome, an important proteolytic protein complex of eukaryotic cells, essential for protein homeostasis [7,8]. Along with their antifungal properties, proteasome inhibitors of bacterial origin have been crucial for inspiring the development of second (e.g., carfilzomib/Kyprolis\u00ae\u2014derived from epoxomicin [6]) and third (e.g., salinosporamide A/Marizomib [9]) generation proteasome inhibitors, with wide anticancer applications [10].", "Ecologically, secondary metabolites are involved in the adaptive processes of species, interacting effectively and specifically with their biological targets [1,2].

The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by bacteria is a well-regulated process, involving groups of genes often organized into biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within the bacterial genome. Each BGC can code for numerous biosynthetic enzymes, regulators and sometimes macromolecules that confer resistance to the final natural product [11,12]. The regulation of BGC expression provides bacteria with a way to expend energy on secondary metabolite production only when it is essential for growth or ecological competition [13]. BGC expression might be regulated by a variety of molecular mechanisms, and thus BGC regulation represents a hurdle for obtaining natural products under laboratory conditions, as most of cultivable bacteria do not express their biosynthetic potential outside of their native environment [14]. Therefore, the need to implement alternative and innovative methodologies to induce the expression of silent and/or poorly expressed BGCs to produce novel bioactive natural substances under controlled conditions is evident [15].", "However, finding and producing bioactive secondary metabolites under controlled artificial conditions is not an easy task.

It has been shown that physical and chemical alterations of growth media may alter the transcription rate of certain genes and may result in the induction of BGC expression otherwise kept silent under laboratory culture conditions. These alterations can involve the composition of growth media or growth conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, oxygenation), co-cultivation with competitors, addition of precursors or the use of chemicals that act as specific or broad epigenetic elicitors [17].

However, LC-MS/MS data processing and mining remain challenging due to the inherent properties of metabolite elution in the LC and its behavior in electrospray ionization (ESI). These challenges have been tackled by the scientific community, including our group, initially focusing on the subsequent experimental problems that can be handled by computational methods, using mathematical rules and the physicochemical logic behind the data. (i) LC provides the separation of stereoisomers, that may display very similar MS/MS spectra. The retention time of the MS/MS must be taken into account, thereby avoiding merging isomeric MS/MS spectral pairs during LC-MS/MS data processing. In addition, the peak area of elution related to a given single compound is important information for the relative quantification of compounds in the sample, and may also be annotated and used during LC-MS/MS data mining. (ii) Variations in ion formation by a given compound during ESI are often observed.
