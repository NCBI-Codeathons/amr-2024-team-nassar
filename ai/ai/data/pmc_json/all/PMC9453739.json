["", "The pairing of analytical chemistry with genomic techniques\nrepresents\na new wave in natural product chemistry. With an increase in the availability\nof sequencing and assembly of microbial genomes, interrogation into\nthe biosynthetic capability of producers with valuable secondary metabolites\nis possible. However, without the development of robust, accessible,\nand medium to high throughput tools, the bottleneck in pairing metabolic\npotential and compound isolation will continue. Several innovative\napproaches have proven useful in the nascent stages of microbial genome-informed\ndrug discovery. Here, we consider a number of these approaches which\nhave led to prioritization of strain targets and have mitigated rediscovery\nrates. Likewise, we discuss integration of principles of comparative\nevolutionary studies and retrobiosynthetic predictions to better understand\nbiosynthetic mechanistic details and link genome sequence to structure.\nLastly, we discuss advances in engineering, chemistry, and molecular\nnetworking and other computational approaches that are accelerating\nprogress in the field of omic-informed natural product drug discovery.\nTogether, these strategies enhance the synergy between cutting edge\nomics, chemical characterization, and computational technologies that\npitch the discovery of natural products with pharmaceutical and other\npotential applications to the crest of the wave where progress is\nripe for rapid advances.", "Genomic approaches to drug discovery\nhave not only focused on the study of human genomes to better understand\nprotein targets, cellular cascades, drug resistance, epigenetics,\nand their implications on human disease to further refine drug discovery\nefforts,1,2 but genomic studies have revealed a vast\nrepertoire of diversity in microbial metabolic innovation which can\nalso be paired with metabolomics for the study of microbially produced\nsecondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites have garnered great interest\nas potential pharmaceuticals as the diverse chemical scaffolds are\nwell suited for biological targets.3 Over\n50% of FDA-approved medications have been sourced directly from or\ninspired by nature.4", "Historically,\nmethods of natural product isolation and characterization\nrelied heavily on extraction of secondary metabolites from both microorganisms\nand macroorganisms requiring time-intensive analytical procedures\nfor isolation and compound characterization. Over time, several barriers\nto natural product discovery have been identified, such as high rediscovery\nrates and the potential ecological impact of mass field collections,\nwith implications on the sustainability of the source. Technological\nadvances have now ameliorated most of these concerns. For example,\nomics techniques have been harnessed to prioritize samples, quickly\nidentify metabolites of interest, and utilize genomic information\nto inform natural product discovery.5\u22127 Technological advances\nalso enhance the potential for a more sustainable exploration of nature\u2019s\nchemical wealth and for creation of an ongoing supply of compounds\nthrough biotechnology.", "One of the primary ways that genomics\nis integrated with drug discovery\nof natural products is by the identification of biosynthetic gene\nclusters (BGCs). BGCs encode for the enzymatic machinery, ranging\nin organization from single iteratively acting enzymes to multidomain\nmegaenzymes with numerous catalytic sites, that are responsible for\nthe biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.8 These discrete genomic elements are similar to, but evolutionarily\ndivergent from, genes involved in primary metabolism (i.e., polyketide\nsynthases are likely derive from fatty acid synthases). The genes\nhave been evolutionarily repurposed to produce an array of architecturally\ndiverse compounds under tight stereochemical controls with a strong\naffinity toward biological targets. BGCs can be horizontally transferred\nfrom one organism to another, a phenomenon that can be identified\nthrough phylogenetic analysis, as the evolutionary history of clustered\nelements within a BGC can be quite divergent from the remainder of\nthe genome.9,10", "Today, there is a wealth\nof publicly accessible databases tailored\nto the fields of genomics and natural products, some linking the two\ndisciplines, and several of which are community-curated with ongoing\ncontributions that serve as data resources (Table 1).

Isotope-guided fractionation using NMR (in parallel\nwith bioassay-guided fractionation) was utilized, and the structure\nof orfamide A was determined through NMR experiments, GC-MS, and Marfey\u2019s\nanalysis.59 Building upon the genomisotopic\napproach, Gerwick and colleagues later enriched the media of cyanobacterial\ncultures with 15N-nitrate and performed repeated MALDI\nexperiments on single-filaments of Moorena producens JHB that allowed for the identification and subsequent isolation\nof a new natural product, cryptomaldamide, through an MS-guided fractionation\napproach.60 Full characterization was performed\nthrough spectroscopic methods, and the compound\u2019s structure\nwas linked to a putative BGC based on genomic analysis. The 28.7 kbp\nBGC for cryptomaldamide was subsequently heterologously expressed\nin a genetically tractable host, Anabaena PCC, giving\nfurther significance to this method of natural product discovery.61 Recently developed by Linington and colleagues,\nthe IsoAnalyst platform uses isotopic labeling of biosynthetic precursors\nin parallel feeding experiments paired with MS to link BGCs to their\nnatural products.62 The platform utilizes\nbiosynthetic relatedness based on the isotopic patterns rather than\nderiving structural information on fragments from the tandem mass\nspectral data. Validated with erythromycin and its analogues, IsoAnalyst\nwas also used to discover a new lobosamide analogue and a new desferrioxiamine\ncompound from Micromonospora sp.62", "Approach 7: Harnessing Paired Genome\u2013Metabolite Data\nSets and Tools for Natural Product Discovery", "Approach 7: Harnessing Paired Genome\u2013Metabolite Data\nSets and Tools for Natural Product Discovery", "Approach 7: Harnessing Paired Genome\u2013Metabolite Data\nSets and Tools for Natural Product Discovery", "Tools to link\nBGCs and MS spectra have been developed, in particular, for NRPs.\nReleased by Behsaz and colleagues, NRPminer63 pairs tandem mass spectral data with NRPS BGCs and builds upon previously\ndeveloped tools, such as NRP2 Path64 and\nNRPquest.65 Through a series of steps which\nintegrate antiSMASH BGC identification from a sequenced genome,15 GNPS molecular networking of the associated\nsample,51 and VarQuest66 searches, a list of potential enzymatic assembly lines\nis populated, filtered, overlaid with potential modifications, and\nthen used to predict possible backbone structures of NRPs.
