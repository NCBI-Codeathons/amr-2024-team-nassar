["Discussion", "Streptomyces sp. BRA-346 is a bacterium of pharmacological importance, as it has shown the capacity to reduce glioma cell viability (Furtado et al., 2021). In the latter report, BRA-346 crude extract and derived fractions were also described as containing epoxyketone peptides and to inhibit the 20S proteasome enzymatic activity. The analysis of the cellular pathways that lead to BRA-346 cell-killing effects in glioma cells indicates a molecular fingerprint related to proteasome inhibition. However, BRA-346 metabolic pools were more effective in killing glioma cells than the isolated DHE (1) alone (Furtado et al., 2021). This reflected that the pool of epoxyketone peptides produced by this bacteria, or other classes of secondary metabolites it could produce, have improved proteasome inhibition or synergistic effect on the latter biological phenomena.", "Here, we show that BRA-346 has the genetic capacity to produce epoxyketone peptides, lipopeptides, macrolactams, carotenoids, diketopiperazines, macrolides, and other classes of secondary metabolites (Supplementary Table S6; Figure 2A). It is stressed from the data presented here that specialized metabolites production by BRA-346 is tightly regulated (Figure 2A), involves quorum sensing systems (Table 1) and can be controlled by specific growth conditions (Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure S9). In addition, the expression of BGCs under the control of TetR-family of transcription factors\u2014as lipopeptides, macrolactams, diketopiperazines, and carotenoids\u2014is correlated with a shift in BRA-346 metabolism directed to downregulation on the production of the target epoxyketone peptides. The latter, are encoded by a single biosynthetic gene cluster in BRA-346 (Figure 4) and this BGC can be expressed in the host organism S. coelicolor M1146, rendering compounds 1\u20134 and additional analogues (Figure 5). As S. coelicolor M1146 is an \u201cantibiotic null\u201d strain (Gomez-Escribano and Bibb, 2011) and the cloned epn/tmc BGC is under the control of a strong promoter, this strategy appears to overcome the negative regulation the other antibiotic BGCs of wild-type Streptomyces sp. BRA-346 exerts over the epn/tmc BGC. This might be due to increased biosynthetic precursors availability (e.g., amino acids and fatty acids), or by reducing quorum sensing and transcription regulation crosstalk.", "In our attempts to use chemical elicitors to awake silent BGCs in BRA-346 ampicillin was the chemical elicitor tested that clearly modulated BRA-346 secondary metabolism in the direction of epoxyketone peptide production (from now on assigned as BRA-346 metabolites of group 1, G1). Ampicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic produced by fungi, has been shown to awake cryptic BGC in bacteria (Okada and Seyedsayamdost, 2017; de Fel\u00edcio et al., 2021), suggesting a chemo-ecological role of ampicillin in eliciting antibiotic production by bacteria. This was also the case for BRA-346 in producing epoxyketone peptides (Figure 3). However, it is still unclear how beta-lactam antibiotics work as chemical elicitors at the molecular level and, in the case of BRA-346, it cannot yet be directly linked to broad epigenetic modulation or specific BGC regulation. Oppositely, the chemical elicitor procaine, upregulated carotenoids, macrolides, and some poorly annotated diketopiperazines/alkaloids (Supplementary Figure S9) in BRA-346 cultures using the A1 medium. This group of specialized metabolites, which can be further modulated by chemical elicitors in A1 medium, is assigned group 2 (G2). On the other hand, macrolactams, lipopeptides, and diketopiperazines related to bicyclomycin would constitute a third group (assigned as group 3, G3), apparently modulated by culture media containing low molecular weight carbohydrates, as TSBY and ISP2 media. The latter metabolites are linked to BRA-346 BGCs that present specific GBL regulatory systems, and TetR repressors (Table 1), linking the activation of GBL-controlled BGCs to nutrient usage, as previously reported (Du et al., 2011).", "Interesting, the BGCs competing for epoxyketone production by wild type BRA-346\u2014which are activated in TSBY and ISP2 media (G3)\u2014are under the control of transcription factors predicted as TetR repressors; whereas competing BGCs activated in the A1 medium (G2, C5 or procaine) are under the control of TetR activators (Table 1). The epn/tmc BGC itself is also controlled by a transcription factor activator (LuxR, Epn/TmcA), also within the TetR superfamily.", "Based on the data given, we hypothesize that the A1 medium is a condition in which quorum sensing molecules, as GBLs, are not being overproduced. The specialized metabolites in G3 are mostly repressed, with their TetR repressors blocking transcription. On the other hand, upon activation of GBL production, in ISP2 and TSBY media for example, these quorum sensing molecules can bind to the TetR repressors, releasing transcription of group 3 BGCs and, additionally, activating their SARP systems. As a result, G3-related BGCs are overexpressed and compete with G1 (epoxyketone peptides) for biosynthetic precursors.", "The BGCs involved in the biosynthesis of G1 and G2, on the other hand, are mostly controlled by transcription activators. In these cases, a basal production is observed, with the preference for G1 or G2 biosynthesis controlled by the extent of activation these BGCs might have procaine upregulated G2 and ampicillin G1. It is not yet clear the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the observed regulation and future work would be necessary to decipher this thread at the molecular level. We could point, however, that the epn/tmc LuxR transcription factor with PAS domain (Epn/TmcA) would be controlled by broader biological pathways (e.g.: redox balance and iron/heme availability or light), as redox cofactors and heme are predicted as the ligands of the Epn/TmcA regulator.", "By cloning the BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC into S. coelicolor M1146, we obtained epoxyketone peptides 1, 3, and 4 and several congeners, including eponemycin (2, Figure 5). Importantly, compounds 2 and 4 could be observed in high amounts, being clearly detected as high intensity LC\u2013MS peaks in the crude extract of S. coelicolor M1146-epn/tmc (Figure 5C). This shows the efficiency and viability of BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC heterologous expression allowing the production of TMC-86A, eponemycin, and epoxyketone peptide congeners under laboratory conditions for future studies. The removal of competing BGCs in the S. coelicolor M1146 host organism might be one of the causes for the observed overexpression of epoxyketone peptide by the heterologous organism. The role of the full-length Epn/TmcA transcription factor present in this clone remains to be elucidated and explored in future efforts. In addition to the epn/tmc BGC overexpression on a heterologous host, this data also highlights that a single BGC of BRA-346 can produce at least two biosynthetic final products, being compounds 2 and 4, showing the plasticity of the BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC to produce epoxyketone peptides.", "Curiously, the epoxyketone peptides TMC-86A (4, m/z 343.19) and eponemycin (2, m/z 399.25) are produced by the heterologous organism containing the BRA-346 epn/tmc biosynthetic gene cluster, whereas the dihydro-intermediates dihydroeponemycin (1, m/z 401.26) and dihydro TMC-86A (3, m/z 345.20) are the preferred products of the wild type organism BRA-346 (Figure 5). It is reported that the oxireductase TmcK is the enzyme responsible for Leu oxidation of 1, rendering 2 (Zabala et al., 2016). It is not clear; however, the mechanisms by which the final biosynthetic step of 2 and 4 is being regulated by BRA-346, since the cultures of the wild type organism favoured the detection of the n-1 dihydro-intermediates. This could be through gene expression of BRA-346 epn/tmcK, negative feedback inhibition of Epn/TmcK enzyme by the end product, or rapid degradation of 2 and 4 in BRA-346 cultures. Curiously, in our phylogenetic analyses we observed that tmcK also shows a TTA codon within the ORF, pointing to an additional regulatory mechanism at the translational level (in a biosynthetic enzyme) in the evolutionary history of this BGC."]
