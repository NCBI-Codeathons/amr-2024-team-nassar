["Discussion", "Our findings reveal that LDs can trap endogenous or external lipophilic phototoxins and this is a resistance mechanism that protects against toxins in both the producer and the recipient. Starting with an investigation of self-resistance mechanisms in an endolichenic fungus, Phaeosphaeria sp., that biosynthesizes phototoxic PQs, we found that the toxins were trapped inside LDs in the producer cells (Fig. 1G). The toxicity of PQs results from ROS formation, particularly singlet oxygen production, following exposure to light. When HA, a PQ derivative, was dissolved in lipophilic solvents that contained triglycerides, fewer singlet oxygen molecules were generated by light irradiation (Fig. 1I), suggesting that trapping PQs into LDs conferred resistance to endogenous phototoxins. This LD-induced resistance mechanism is also critical for maintaining a lichen community that contains a toxin producer.", "Moreover, yeast cells with larger LDs trap HA and display higher resistance to phototoxicity, suggesting that trapping toxins in LDs is also a mechanism for the recipient to resist extracellular toxins. The reduced phototoxic effect of HA in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae can be attributed to the ability of LDs to trap toxins, and yeast with larger LDs may trap more toxins, thus conferring increased resistance to HA-mediated phototoxicity or to the lipophilic agent farnesol. The trapped toxins in LDs lose the ability to induce the production of ROS, resulting in the increased survival of the fungi (Figs 2E and 4). This is different from what occurs in organelles such as chloroplasts, mitochondria and peroxisomes that employ antioxidant defence systems to protect against ROS8. Our findings demonstrate that LDs could be a novel strategy for relieving oxidative stress via trapping of toxins. This observation is supported by the fact that yeast mutants with depleted LD formation are more susceptible to oxidative stress resulting from photodynamic inactivation (Fig. 3).", "In nature, organisms have evolved multiple strategies for adapting to environmental challenges and, in particular, for counteracting oxidative stress4243. Cells possess very efficient enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defence systems that work together to protect themselves from oxidative damage89. The non-enzymatic antioxidant defence systems mainly comprise physical quenching and chemical quenching processes that sequester ROS production444546. Physical quenching is the main mode for deactivating lipid-soluble antioxidants and is related to energy transfer44, while chemical quenching prevails in water-soluble antioxidants, and the quencher molecule is generally oxidised or consumed in the process of ROS scavenging44. The present findings contribute to our understanding of how LD-mediated trapping leads to the inactivation of the ROS production that generally occurs in response to lipophilic toxins. The main constituents of LDs include TAGs and SEs, which have lipophilic characteristics that give them high affinity to PQs and lay the basis for trapping mechanisms. For large amounts of toxins, trapping in LDs is probably the best resistance mechanism for preventing self-damage.", "Unexpectedly, C. albicans cells with large LDs displayed no obvious alterations in susceptibility in response to most of the tested antibiotics compared with those with small LDs following culture in YPD medium (Supplementary Fig. 10). This was probably owing to the polarity of tested antibiotics, which prevents them from dissolving mutually with LDs or to the specificity of their targets outside LDs, as exemplified by the fact that AmB-Ds primarily bind to the cytoplasmic membrane rather than being taken up into LDs (Supplementary Fig. 11). However, the increases in LD size and number observed in C. albicans cells that were stimulated by AmB or Mic treatment suggested that the generation of neutral lipids is a stress response. Disruption of DAG2 caused the loss of the ability to form LDs and rendered C. albicans more susceptible to AmB, Mic and farnesol treatment (Supplementary Fig. 13). Moreover, the LD-defective strain of S. cerevisiae was highly susceptible to farnesol, AmB and Mic (Supplementary Fig. 14 and Fig. 15). This implies that the disruption of LD formation results in a suppressed stress response and renders yeast cells more susceptible to fungicides.", "In summary, our investigation of the self-protecting strategies of an endolichenic fungus that involve the trapping of phototoxins led to the determination that fungal LDs play crucial roles in drug resistance and adaptations to stress. Although it remains to be determined whether this represents a more generalised strategy for resistance or self-protection in other organisms, our findings offer new insights into the roles of LDs in resistance mechanisms used by fungi and the development of antifungal strategies."]
