["3. Discussion", "Photosynthesis is an important fundamental physiological process that is responsible for the growth and biomass in higher plants and also one of the most sensitive physiological processes to environmental stress [31]. Previous studies have showed that drought stress induced water loss, photosynthetic inhibition, and the damage to membrane system in creeping bentgrass [32,33,34]. Gradual declines in leaf RWC, cell membrane stability, Chl content, Fv/Fm, PIABS, and Pn in creeping bentgrass were observed due to a prolonged drought stress; however, the Spm pretreatment effectively alleviated these adverse effects caused by drought (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Chl is the main photosynthetic pigment that plays vital role in receiving and converting light energy in plants [35]. Drought stress significantly reduced the Chl a, Chl b, and total Chl content; however, the decrease in Chl a was greater than that of Chl b in leaves of creeping bentgrass. It has been observed that Chl a was more susceptible to stress than Chl b [36]. During Chl degradation, a part of Chl b can be compensated by products of Chl a degradation [37]. Relevant studies have found that PAs could protect the structural and functional integrity of chloroplasts, thereby slowing down the degradation rate of photosynthetic pigments under abiotic stress [16,38,39], which was consistent with our findings.", "Stomatal movement is one of the most key regulatory mechanisms in plants affecting Tr, photosynthesis, and WUE under drought stress [40]. During drought stress, a gradual decline in Pn was accompanied by gradual decreases in Gs and Ci, indicating that the cause of the decline in photosynthetic rate in both of the Spm- and non-pretreated creeping bentgrasses was mainly affected by stomatal limitation. Plants mainly reduce Tr by restricting stomatal opening, which is conducive to reduction of water loss in leaves in response to drought stress. However, stomatal closure also diminishes gas exchange leading to the limitation of CO2 supply for photosynthesis. So, the homeostasis between Tr and Pn was quite important. Under drought stress, the Spm application could effectively alleviate the decrease in WUE of creeping bentgrass by maintaining significantly higher Tr and Pn in favor of the adaptation to water deficit (Figure 2). Chl fluorescence can reflect the absorption, transmission, and conversion of light energy by leaves and is used as an indicator to quantitatively analyze and compare the physiological state of plants under different environmental conditions [41]. Fv/Fm reflects the maximum photochemical quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), and the photosynthetic performance index PIABS indicates the state of the plant photosynthetic system, which is more sensitive to abiotic stresses than Fv/Fm [42,43,44]. Creeping bentgrass pretreated with Spm had higher Fv/Fm and PIABS than those without Spm treatment under drought stress, which indicated that the Spm improved drought tolerance of creeping bentgrass associated with maintenance of better PSII (Figure 2).", "PAs concentration varies with the growth stage and the external environment in plants. Drought leads to the higher accumulation of PAs content in leaves, which is an important strategy for plants to adapt to water-limited conditions [45]. In this current study, the Put, Spd, Spm, and total PAs content increased significantly under drought stress, and exogenous application of Spm further enhanced their accumulation in creeping bentgrass subjected to drought stress (Figure 3). These results indicated that elevated PAs levels promoted drought tolerance in creeping bentgrass. Similar results have been found in creeping bentgrass or other plant species [46,47]. In addition to PAs accumulation, PAs biosynthesis and catabolism also play pivotal roles in regulating tolerance to abiotic stresses [19,48]. ADC and ODC are two key enzymes for the biosynthesis of Put, and S-AMDC is involved in the biosynthesis of Spd and Spm. Drought stress enhanced the activities of ADC, ODC, and S-AMDC, indicating that PAs synthesis was significantly affected by these pathways. An earlier study showed that the methylglyoxal-bis-guanylhydrazone (MGBG), an inhibitor of S-AMDC activity, decreased the contents of Spm and Spd resulting in reduced drought tolerance of wheat seedlings [49]. The Spm application further improved drought-induced increases in activities of ADC, ODC, and S-AMDC (Figure 3). It could be concluded that increases in Put, Spd, and Spm contents in Spm-pretreated plants under drought stress was not only due to the direct absorption of Spm, but also due to the significant enhancement of ADC, ODC, and S-AMDC activities to promote their biosynthesis. Interestingly, drought stress also significantly enhanced activities of DAO and PAO that are two catabolic enzymes of PAs metabolism through oxidizing Put, Spd, and Spm to form GABA [50]. However, the DAO activity in Spm-pretreated creeping bentgrass was significantly higher, but PAO activity was significantly lower when compared to that in untreated plants under drought stress. This might be associated with the maintenance of higher Spd and Spm content. Previous studies found that the accumulation of Spd and Spm were more important than the Put when plants suffered from water deficit [46,51].", "Apart from the catabolism of Spd and Spm, the GAD catalyzed GABA synthesis by using Glu as a substrate is an important pathway of GABA biosynthesis in plants [52]. As a non-protein amino acid, the GABA is associated with the carbon and N metabolism and has also been identified as a signaling molecule regulating growth and stress tolerance of plants [53,54]. Elevated GABA accumulation by exogenous GABA application could significantly enhance drought tolerance of creeping bentgrass [30]. The GABA branch can provide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and succinate to feed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [52]. This process is then of primary importance because enhanced TCA cycle could provide more energy for growth and stress defense under unfavorable environmental conditions [55]. Current findings showed that the Spm application further significantly improved the drought-induced increases in Glu content, GABA content, and GAD activity (Figure 4). These findings indicated that the Spm induced GABA accumulation mainly associated with the activation of GAD and DAO in leaves of creeping bentgrass. In addition, GABA-T activity declined, but \u03b1-KGDH activity increased gradually in creeping bentgrass during drought stress. The GABA-T catalyzes the transformation between GABA and succinic semialdehyde. The \u03b1-KGDH is a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and its function is to decompose \u03b1-KGDH in plants [56]. Under drought stress, the Spm could promote the TCA cycle through activating \u03b1-KGDH and GABA-T activities contributing towards enhanced drought tolerance. The Spm-pretreated creeping bentgrass exhibited significantly higher \u03b1-KGDH and GABA-T activities than untreated plants during drought stress (Figure 4). Our earlier study also demonstrated that the supply of GABA could maintain higher intermediates of TCA cycle in leaves of creeping bentgrass under heat stress, thereby alleviating heat-induced metabolic imbalance and damage [57].", "The Glu plays a central metabolic role in N assimilation pathways and can be used as a source of N for the biosynthesis of other amino acids such as Pro and GABA [58,59,60]. N metabolism is one of the most fundamental metabolic processes, affecting growth status, yield, and stress tolerance in plants [61]. Drought stress reduced the uptake and assimilation of main inorganic nitrogenous compounds including NH4+ and nitrate nitrogen (NO3\u2212) by roots [62]. NR is the key synthase of NO2\u2212 while NiR is the main enzyme to produce NH4+ [63]. It has been reported that drought or salt stress reduced NR activity and NO2\u2212 content in various plant species [22,64,65]. Similar results were also found in our present study. However, Spm pretreatment significantly alleviated declines in NR activity and NO2\u2212 content in leaves of creeping bentgrass under drought stress (Figure 5). Interestingly, drought stress resulted in immense accumulation of NH4+ and significant increase in NiR activity in creeping bentgrass, and the Spm application alleviated their increases induced by drought stress. NH4+ can be produced by NiR catalyzing NO2\u2212 and many other pathways in plants [66]. Reduced accumulation of NH4+ in plant tissues is considered to be an important ability to resist drought stress, since the overproduction of NH4+ cause toxicity in cells [63]. GS, GOGAT, and GDH are three key rate-limiting enzymes in the process of NH4+ assimilation and catalyze the biosynthesis of Glu by using NH4+ in plants [67]. Drought stress improved NiR activity and decreased GS and GOGAT activities, which might result in the overaccumulation of NH4+ in creeping bentgrass. The Spm pretreatment could significantly alleviate drought-induced decrease in GS and GOGAT activities and also maintained significantly higher GDH activity, which indicated the Spm-mitigated inhibition of NH4+ assimilation possibly associated with the mediation of GDH and GS/GOGAT pathways (Figure 5). In addition, the improvement in GDH activity induced by the Spm contributed to the accumulation of Glu in creeping bentgrass under drought stress. The GDH can transform glutamic acid into \u03b1-ketoglutarate associated with the TCA cycle in plants. The improvement of N assimilation and alleviation of ammonia toxicity could be the important regulatory mechanisms in relation to the Spm-regulated drought tolerance in creeping bentgrass.", "As a stress-inducible amino acid, the function of Pro in response to drought stress has been widely elucidated in plants. Its accumulation and metabolism are involved in osmotic adjustment and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, thus regulating the stability of intracellular structure and membrane system under drought stress [68]. Pro content is also often used as an important index to estimate the severity of stress injury in plants [69]. In this present study, Pro content in the leaves of creeping bentgrass increased rapidly during drought stress (Figure 6A), but the Pro content in Spm-pretreated plants was not significantly different from that in the untreated plants. Pro biosynthesis is dependent on Glu pathway and ornithine pathway, and OAT and P5CS are the key enzymes in these two pathways. ProDH is a chief enzyme in Pro catabolism pathway and it catalyzes the degradation of Pro to produce Glu in plants [70]. Drought stress significantly improved OAT and P5CS activities, but significantly inhibited the ProDH activity in creeping bentgrass with and without the Spm application under drought stress (Figure 6). This indicated that increase in Pro accumulation could be an important adaptive response in creeping bentgrass under drought stress. Although there was no significant difference in OAT activity between Spm-pretreated and non-pretreated plants under drought stress (Figure 6B), but the Spm-pretreated creeping bentgrass maintained significantly higher P5CS and ProDH activities than untreated plants under drought stress (Figure 6C,D). Similar results were found in our previous studies which demonstrated that exogenous Spm improved drought tolerance of white clover associated with higher Pro metabolism by activating P5CS and ProDH activities [71]. Maintenance of higher Pro metabolism instead of more Pro accumulation could be one of the main regulatory mechanisms for the Spm-induced drought tolerance in plants, which will be beneficial for the improved Glu cycle and metabolic homeostasis of amino acids under water deficient conditions."]
