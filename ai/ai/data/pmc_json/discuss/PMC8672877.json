["DISCUSSION", "Although >50 different Trichoderma genomes have been determined by NGS technology, almost all of the NGS genomic drafts are far from nearly complete or chromosome-level assemblies due to the shortcomings of short NGS reads and the exceedingly low-complexity nature of Trichoderma genomes. In contrast, the seven nearly complete Trichoderma genomes we have determined by TGS technology represent the highest quality yet achieved. The greatest benefits of precise genome assemblies are that they enable accurate determination of structural components in each genome (e.g., telomeres, centromeres, interspersed AT-rich blocks and authentic transposable elements), as well as the chromosome synteny between different Trichoderma species. First, the results of our comparative genomic analysis reveal that all seven genomes likely underwent extensive transposon invasions followed by RIP mutations (Fig.\u00a0S3), explaining why the overall numbers of authentic transposons (i.e., which have not been extensively mutated or degenerated by RIP) in these seven genomes are relatively low (Table\u00a0S2). Second, we reported previously that the longest AT-rich blocks in all seven QM6a chromosomes are likely their centromeres, as they collectively harbor 24 centromere-specific and conserved satellite repeats (21). Here, we further demonstrate that the putative centromeric loci in all seven Trichoderma genomes are not only the longest AT-rich blocks but also the longest regions of each chromosome lacking an open-reading frame (ORF) or putative protein-encoding genes (Fig.\u00a0S4\u2013S8 and Table\u00a0S3). Third, the genomes of different Trichoderma species exhibit extensive chromosome shuffling. Disruption of chromosome synteny often but not always occurs near or within AT-rich blocks or even the predicted centromeres (Fig.\u00a01). One possibility is that mobilization of ancient retrotransposons might induce chromosome rearrangements. Alternatively, chromosome translocations via recombination of AT-rich blocks or centromere scission (80) may drive chromosome shuffling to reshape the genomes of different species. In this regard, retrotransposition and RIP might act as a critical driver of genome reorganization, eventually leading to genome diversification within a species (microevolution) and between species (macroevolution). Consequently, the newly generated strains harboring chromosome translocations may fail to undergo successful sexual reproduction with the parental wild-type strain because extensive chromosomal heterozygosity results in recombination suppression during meiosis, i.e., via nonhomologous pairing, synaptic adjustments or shifts in recombination (or chiasma) positions (81, 82).", "Locally, the order of biosynthetic genes, AT-rich blocks, and retrotransposons in SM-BGCs provides detailed insights into the mechanisms of genome evolution. Our data indicate that evolutionarily conserved SM-BGCs often lack or only contain a few longer AT-rich blocks (\u2265500\u2009bp). In contrast, the GTX-BGCs in FT-333 and Gv29-8 have 10 such blocks. This unique property of GTX-BGCs had not been reported before because NGS sequence reads are too short to assemble chromosomal regions of low sequence complexity (36). We suggest that GTX-BGCs represent versatile systems for future experimental evolution studies to reveal the functional impacts of AT-rich blocks for the expression and regulation of GTX biosynthesis. Also noteworthy is that orthologs of GTX biosynthetic genes are randomly allocated across the genomes of T. atroviride and T. asperellum. The gene order of the putative GTX-BGC in T. reesei also differs from that of the authentic GTX-BGCs in T. virens (Fig.\u00a0S16). We conclude that diverse and/or multistep mechanisms were involved in the formation of different SM-BGCs during evolution (83), such as lateral gene transfer, unequal crossing over, or transposon-mediated gene transfer. Lateral gene transfer (also called horizontal gene transfer) represents the acquisition of genetic material from another organism (e.g., bacteria), whereas unequal crossing over involves the exchange of sequences between chromosomes. Because the GTX-BGCs of both FT-333 and Gv29-8 are located in the subtelomeres of their first chromosomes, it would be interesting to determine if BIR (42, 43) or other molecular mechanisms might play critical roles in generating or maintaining this T. virens-specific gene cluster.", "High-quality and near complete genome sequences also ensure accurate and comprehensive genome annotation. Based on NGS-based genome sequences, it was reported previously that T. reesei and its ancestor might have undergone rapid gene loss relative to several other of the most common Trichoderma species (37). Notably, a smaller gene inventory might result from less intensive expansion of certain gene families rather than profound loss of distinct protein-encoding genes. In contrast, our genome-wide annotation data indicate that QM6a, CBS1-1, CBS1-2, and FT-101 encode more near-universal single-copy orthologs (NUSCOs) than the genomes of P1, Gv29-8, and FT-333, with the BUSCO protein metrics of QM6a, CBS1-1, CBS1-2, and FT-101 being higher respectively than those of P1, Gv29-8, and FT-333 (Table\u00a01). BUSCOs are ideal for quantifying genome and proteome completeness, as the assumptions for these NUSCOs are evolutionarily sound (84). The genome sizes of QM6a, CBS1-1, and CBS1-2 are much smaller than those of FT-101, P1, Gv29-8, and FT-333. Thus, the genomes of T. reesei and its ancestor might not have experienced rapid gene loss. Instead, compared with the genomes of QM6a and the two CBS999.97 strains, the genomes of P1, Gv29-8, and FT-333 appear to have experienced both gene loss and extensive gene family expansions during evolution. In contrast, the genome of FT-101 only underwent extensive gene family expansions and not gene loss (Table\u00a01). These findings represent a striking example of why TGS-based genomes are superior to NGS-based genomes for comparative and functional studies. Because the overall numbers of interspersed AT-rich blocks (\u2265500\u2009bp) in QM6a, CBS1-1, and CBS1-2 are much lower (50% to 70%) than those in FT-101, P1, Gv29-8, and FT-333, we further infer that the larger genome sizes of these latter and their more extensive gene family expansions might have arisen from more profound mobilization and RIP of ancient retrotransposons in their ancestral genomes.", "In this study, we have shown by comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses that different Trichoderma species might utilize both conserved and diverse proteins or signaling pathways to mediate fungal-plant interactions (Fig.\u00a02D). Our genome-wide annotation results also have revealed a comprehensive array of SM-BGCs and CAZ-BGCs in each of the four Trichoderma species we considered herein (Fig.\u00a04). The majority of SM-BGCs, CAZ-BGCs, and effector-like SP proteins are poorly understood and, consequently, their corresponding products and physiological functions are largely unknown. Because a variety of genome mining methods and tools have been developed to guide characterization and activation of gene clusters (85\u201387), the nearly complete genome resources provided in this study will help discover and/or functionally characterize new SMs, CAZymes, and effector-like SP proteins, as well as their roles in and underlying evolutionary mechanisms of mycoparasitism, fungal-plant interactions and biocontrol activities.", "Conclusion.", "Our study highlights that high-quality and nearly complete genome sequences are necessary tools for accurate comparative and functional genomic analyses. The data we have presented herein provide numerous insights into fundamental biology and industrial biotechnology."]
