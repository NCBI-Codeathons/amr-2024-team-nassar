["Discussion", "Apart from some reports on cultivating and manipulating the industrially valuable A40926 producer N. gerenzanensis (Stinchi et al., 2003, 2006; Marcone et al., 2010a,b,c; Alt et al., 2019) and the kistamicin producer Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 55076 (Greule et al., 2019), we are not aware of any other attempt to develop genetic tools for manipulating Nonomuraea spp. However, some other glycopeptide producers, like A. teichomyceticus, already possess well-developed toolkits for genetic manipulation which has greatly simplified investigations in these strains (Horbal et al., 2013; Yushchuk et al., 2016). Therefore, our first goal in this work was to develop a set of genetic tools for manipulating diverse species of Nonomuraea. To do this, we decided to work in parallel with the better-known A40926 producer, recently re-classified as N. gerenzanensis (Dalmastri et al., 2016), and with the little investigated N. coxensis, which was isolated in Bangladesh in 2007 (Ara et al., 2007). Although the available N. coxensis genome sequence is still incomplete, we could identify three contigs covering most of a dbv-like gene cluster including the dbv-like cluster-situated regulatory genes, which we named nocRI (dbv3 homolog) and nocRII (dbv4 homolog). The next step of our work will be additional sequencing to yield a properly annotated N. coxensis genome. Interestingly, during the course of our investigations, Waglechner et al. (2019), systematically screening the available sequences in genomic databases, also reported the presence of a BGC encoding for a A40926-like GPA in the genome of N. coxensis. In addition, the same authors reported that a newly isolated Nonomuraea sp. WAC01424 possess a BGC which could produce another A40926-related compound (Waglechner et al., 2019). Our preliminary analysis of this BGC suggests that it could be a sulfated A40926-like GPA, lacking the aliphatic side chains.", "In the meantime, we tested both in N. gerenzanensis and N. coxensis, a set of heterologous and native promoters (the latter derived from a set of house-keeping genes in N. gerenzanensis) with the final goal of using them for driving gene expression in these strains. Besides the practical outcome of this screening (all of the generated promoter-probe vectors could be easily used as expression vectors simply by exchanging gusA for a gene of interest, offering a set of variable tools for gene expression), it is interesting to observe that the studied promoters had similar strengths in the two phylogenetically distant Nonomuraea species and that the native promoters from N. gerenzanensis worked similarly in N. coxensis. Consistently, we detected a comparable difference in the two strains between the strength of promoters driving the expression of rifamycin-sensitive and rifamycin-resistant rpoB alleles of N. gerenzanensis (rpoBngp and rpoBRngp). Since we found the two rpoB alleles in N. coxensis draft genome (on a short genomic scaffolds KB904038 and KB904038), we might suppose that their manipulation could improve antibiotic production in this strain as already reported for N. gerenzanensis (Vigliotta et al., 2004). More generally, these vectors should be useful for the genetic manipulation of other members of the genus Nonomuraea, which have the potential to produce novel valuable specialized metabolites (Sungthong and Nakaew, 2015; Nazari et al., 2017).", "As in the case of Actinoplanes spp. (Horbal et al., 2013), the strongest heterologous promoter was aac(3)IVp, although some N. gerenzanensis native promoters like hrdBngp and rpsLngp appeared to have comparable strength and merit further investigations. When we used aac(3)IVp to overexpress the cluster-situated regulatory genes dbv3 and dbv4 from the N. gerenzanensis dbv gene cluster and nocRI (dbv3-like) from the A40926-like BGC of N. coxensis, the recombinant N. gerenzanensis strains produced significantly more A40926 than the parental strain. The evidence that the heterologous expression of nocRI increased A40926 production in N. gerenzanensis confirmed its role in regulating the expression of a A40926-like BGC in N. coxensis. Additionally, it represents another case of cross-talk between regulators controlling GPA BGCs in producing actinomycetes (Spohn et al., 2014). Our next goal will be to investigate if and how (in which cultivation conditions) N. coxensis produces A40926 or a A40926-like molecule.", "Previous work (Lo Grasso et al., 2015) reported that overexpression of dbv3 (under the control of the thiostrepton-inducible tipA* promoter in the integrative plasmid pIJ8600) in N. gerenzanensis increased A40926 production from 13 to 27 mg/l using the laboratory medium R3 (Lo Grasso et al., 2015). In this paper, we tested the real industrial potential of overexpressing not only dbv3, but also dbv4, and dbv3 and dbv4 together, cloning them under the strong constitutive aac(3)IVp promoter, scaling up their cultivation at bioreactor scale and using a previously optimized industrial medium where A40926 is produced in hundreds of milligrams per liter (Marcone et al., 2010a, 2014). At the bioreactor level, where strains could have a different performance from the flask-cultivation due to different mixing and mass transfer rates of nutrients and oxygen, the best performer was the strain carrying both dbv4 under aac(3)IVp and dbv3 under its own endogenous promoter. This strain produced nearly 800 mg/l of A40926, which is twice that of the parental strain grown under the same conditions. Conversely, the strain carrying only dbv3 expressed from aac(3)IVp showed reduced production capacity and an altered phenotype particularly after scaling up from flask to bioreactor; in contrast, the dbv4 overexpressing recombinant grew similarly under both conditions. It is widely recognized that any potentially higher producing mutant or derivative needs to be validated in a bioreactor-scale fermentation since unpredictable discrepancies in strain performance can occur during scaling up from flask culture (Lee and Kim, 2015). In the case of the dbv3 overexpressing recombinant, we believe that the fragmented mycelial phenotype, which was much more apparent in the bioreactor, could be a specific consequence of the overexpression of the dbv7 gene encoding a d,d-carboxypeptidase known as VanYn (Binda et al., 2012). The level of VanYn activity in cell extracts from the dbv3-carrying recombinant cultivated at bioreactor scale was found to be much higher than in the parental strain (unpublished data). Consistent with this, overexpression of VanYn altered the mycelial morphology in N. gerenzanensis as well as in heterologous hosts such as streptomycetes strains (Binda et al., 2013).", "In conclusion, only a few GPAs are used in clinical practice and those produced by semi-synthesis from natural products, such as dalbavancin derived from A40926, are still quite expensive. Dalbavancin is the first antibiotic designated as a Qualified Infection Diseases Product by the FDA because of its potency, extended dosing interval, and unique dose regimen, but its cost largely exceeds that of first-generation GPAs and consequently its use in hospitals is still limited (Chiasson and White, 2016; Agarwal et al., 2018). Improving A40926-producing strains might lead to a decrease in the cost of dalbavancin. As demonstrated in this paper, A40926 production could be significantly enhanced by manipulating the expression of dbv cluster-situated regulators. An important and often-neglected aspect is testing the genetic stability and productivity of the selected recombinant strains in a fully developed industrial process at bioreactor level, which mimics the conditions of antibiotic large scale production. We were able to demonstrate here that the improvements we made to A40926 production levels in shake flasks were also achieved in the bioreactor, indicating the relevance of this approach to industrial-scale strain improvement."]
