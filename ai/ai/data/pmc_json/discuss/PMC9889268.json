["Discussion", "Colibactin is an unusual natural product with important implications for human health, yet determining its chemical structure remains challenging. The proposed pseudodimeric colibactin structure explains aspects of its bioactivity\u2014such as the ability to introduce inter-strand cross-links in DNA\u2014and requires the activity of all biosynthetic enzymes in the pks island. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the conversion of precolibactin to the active colibactin genotoxin by ClbP. Our study details how ClbP recognizes and cleaves the N-acyl-d-asparagine prodrug motif from precolibactin, addressing the role of the TMD in enzymatic function and the basis of substrate specificity. We discovered that ClbP forms a dimer that may promote the simultaneous activation of the two colibactin warheads, further supporting the proposed pseudodimeric structure of precolibactin.", "The requirement of the full ClbP TMD for enzyme activity21 is explained by the substrate interactions with the TM2\u2013TM3 linker. W466 contacts the acyl group of the prodrug motif, and the W466A mutation inactivates ClbP. Beyond its roles in substrate binding, the ClbP TMD may enable interactions with other proteins, such as the precolibactin transporter ClbM or, as recently suggested, the MchF microcin exporter30. Besides W466, the only TMD residue strictly conserved among prodrug-activating peptidases is W460, yet the W460A mutation did not affect cleavage of our monomeric probe. The region around W460\u2014in the TM2\u2013TM3 linker with its sidechain wedged between TM2 and TM3\u2014is a good candidate for mediating contacts with other proteins.", "Hydrogen bonds from S188 and N331 to the prodrug d-asparagine sidechain are crucial for activity, and N331 is critical for d-asparagine specificity. The severe functional impairment by S188A and N331A, combined with the inability of ClbP to process substrates with d-alanine prodrug motifs20, suggest that d-asparagine\u2013ClbP interactions are essential to bind and orient the substrate for catalysis. Conversely, the H257A mutation had little effect on peptidase activity, suggesting that the d-asparagine\u2013H257 interactions are less important for prodrug cleavage. Accordingly, the OH\u2013O angle between the S188 hydroxyl and the substrate\u2019s carbonyl acceptor is 175\u00b0, more optimal for hydrogen bonding than the 124\u00b0 NH\u2013O angle formed with H257. Furthermore, position 257 is not conserved among prodrug-activating peptidases and predominantly corresponds to asparagine. A H257N substitution would likely place hydrogen-bonding groups too far to strongly interact with the substrate\u2019s d-asparagine sidechain carbonyl. The N331 sidechain carbonyl enforces substrate specificity by selecting for prodrug motifs containing d-amino acids with hydrogen-bond donors that can interact with it, explaining why ClbP does not cleave d-aspartate motifs. Accordingly, the E92Q mutation, which disrupts the interaction network that stabilizes and orients N331, substantially increased cleavage of a d-aspartate-containing substrate. Because E92Q also cleaves d-asparagine substrates at a wild-type-like rate, the E92Q mutation likely results in an N331 sidechain without preferential orientation that can either accept hydrogen bonds from the d-asparagine amide NH or donate hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate in d-aspartate. N331 is strictly conserved among all prodrug-activating peptidases, suggesting that this mechanism for d-asparagine specificity is also conserved.", "The dimer interface that we observed seems unique to Proteobacterial ClbPs and is not conserved in the sequences of other prodrug-activating peptidases or homologs from the broader S12 family. Precolibactin is the only prodrug-activating peptidase substrate proposed to have two prodrug motifs (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4), so ClbP may have evolved a dimeric binding site to accommodate it. Colibactin activation involves the formation of reactive electrophiles that must remain intact until they encounter DNA and produce the inter-strand cross-links that characterize colibactin toxicity. Dimeric ClbP could, thus, be important to simultaneously activate the two warheads and ensure that most of the colibactin produced has two active warheads. Because inter-strand cross-links and the resultant double-strand breaks are especially deleterious, the synthesis of toxins that inflict this type of DNA damage on other organisms may offer a competitive advantage to colibactin-producing bacteria31,32. The functional role of the ClbP dimer and the effects of its disruption on colibactin maturation remain unknown. Our results indicate the dimer interface is crucial for ClbP stability and, therefore, suggest that the role of dimerization cannot readily be studied with dimer-disrupting mutations. A previous study found that mutation of D367, which forms a buried ion pair with R308 at the dimer interface, to leucine impairs colibactin maturation by ClbP (ref. 21). The authors concluded that this was due to a disruption of the negative electrostatic surface potential. Considering the dimeric ClbP structure, this mutation may, instead, impair ClbP dimerization or stability and, in turn, reduce its ability to produce colibactins capable of causing double-strand breaks. Disrupting the ClbP dimer could potentially lead to the production of aberrant colibactins that are still genotoxic, albeit by inflicting different DNA lesions. Finally, the ClbP dimer cavity may play a role in protecting the warheads of mature colibactin from reacting with periplasmic nucleophiles before being exported from the producing cell.", "Intact colibactin has never been isolated, so its structure has been inferred based on biosynthetic pathway intermediates and the enzymes that assemble them and total synthesis of a candidate molecule8. Several structures that explain observations about the biochemistry and activity of colibactin have been proposed, with the currently favored pseudodimeric structures explaining the characteristic cross-linking ability of colibactin. The ClbP dimer demonstrated here supports the biological relevance of a pseudodimeric candidate precolibactin and offers clues into potential mechanisms to regulate toxin activation and preserve the reactivity of its warheads toward DNA."]
