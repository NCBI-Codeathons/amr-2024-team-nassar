["DISCUSSION", "Lugdunin, the first nonribosomally synthesized antibiotic from human microbiomes, has a novel structure and an unusual protonophore-like mode of action, which distinguishes it from most of the antibiotics in clinical use (9). Lugdunin causes proton leakage in synthetic, protein-free membrane vesicles, suggesting that it does not need to target a proteinaceous molecule to exert its antibacterial activity (9). The atypical mode of action raised the question of whether the bacterial producer strains would also use an unusual mechanism to achieve self-resistance to lugdunin. As shown for other cyclic peptides, lugdunin may be able to oligomerize in membranes (15\u201317), which might also have an influence on its recognition by the lugdunin transporters. We demonstrate that S. lugdunensis uses the four ABC transporter proteins LugEFGH for lugdunin secretion and self-resistance (Fig. 5), which is reminiscent of several other antimicrobial molecule producers (2, 18). The use of two separate ABC transporters for antimicrobial secretion and self-resistance has previously been documented, for instance, for several lantibiotics and other bacteriocins (18). Moreover, the phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) peptides produced by most Staphylococcus species are secreted by an ABC transporter complex, which is encoded by four genes most probably forming two separate transporters, PmtAB and PmtCD (19). They confer self-resistance to PSMs and several other membrane-damaging cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) (20).", "FIG 5Model for the roles of LugIEFGH in lugdunin secretion and self-resistance. LugEF has a dominant role in lugdunin secretion and a minor role in lugdunin resistance. In contrast, LugGH is mostly responsible for self-resistance, presumably by taking lugdunin up from the membrane bilayer. LugI contributes to secretion and resistance by collaborating with the ABC transporters in a currently unclear fashion. Putative minor lugdunin passageways are shown as dashed arrows. ABCD depicts the intracellular lugdunin-biosynthetic enzymes.", "Model for the roles of LugIEFGH in lugdunin secretion and self-resistance.

LugGH had a dominant role in lugdunin resistance in S. aureus, which was even enhanced by the presence of LugI. Accordingly, LugGH had only a weak effect on lugdunin release in S. lugdunensis. Although deletion of lugGH in S. lugdunensis had only a minor effect on the MIC compared to lugEF deletion, it had a strong impact on the growth and fitness of lugdunin-producing S. lugdunensis, which is in agreement with its capacity to protect the producer against its product. The S. lugdunensis\nlugGH mutant released even slightly more lugdunin than the wild type for unclear reasons, maybe as a consequence of dysregulation of the lugdunin-biosynthetic process in these highly stressed mutant bacteria. This might also be the explanation for the unexpected strong impact of lugEF deletion in S. lugdunensis on the MIC, although LugEF does not change the MIC level in S. aureus. As for several other ABC exporters conferring resistance to membrane-active compounds, it can be assumed that LugH takes up its cargo from the membrane bilayer by opening the channel laterally (Fig. 5). In contrast to LugGH, LugEF did not seem to affect the producer\u2019s fitness but had a dominant impact on lugdunin release, probably by acquiring lugdunin from the biosynthetic machinery (LugABCD) in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, LugEF also contributed to lugdunin resistance, maybe by exporting excess cytoplasmic or membrane-embedded lugdunin (Fig. 5). It is currently not clear if the two transporter systems form indeed a complex together with LugI. It is possible that LugEF may be associated with the biosynthesis machinery formed by LugABCD to directly export newly synthesized lugdunin, which, in addition to the stoichiometry of the LugIEFGH products, remains to be explored.", "It remains unclear how LugI may contribute to lugdunin secretion and self-resistance, but it is obvious that its role in resistance depends on the presence of both ABC transporters. Accessory membrane proteins have been described for other ABC transporters, for instance, the S. aureus VraDEH system, which confers resistance to CAMPs. In addition to the ATPase VraD and the integral membrane component VraE, the system includes the small VraH protein, which is required for high-level resistance to gallidermin and daptomycin and has been denoted a \u201cpeptide resistance ABC transporter activity modulator\u201d (23), a term also appropriate for LugI. VraH has a similar size and predicted membrane topology as LugI, but no obvious sequence similarity. Accessory integral membrane proteins are also known to complement ABC transporters secreting and conferring producer self-resistance to the lantibiotics epidermin and gallidermin (21, 22).", "Only inversion of the lugdunin structure in enantio-lugdunin or a minor change at amino acid position 6 of lugdunin were tolerated by the resistance mechanism, although resistance to these congeners was much less pronounced than for native lugdunin. In contrast, changes at position 2 abrogated the capacity of LugIEFGH to confer resistance completely. The high selectivity distinguishes the lugdunin resistance mechanism from those to other antimicrobial molecules such as PSMs or from multidrug ABC exporters such as Sav1866 (24) or AbcA (25, 26). Slight modifications of lugdunin that maintain or even increase its antimicrobial activity will therefore make it difficult for LugIEFGH to neutralize such variants if they would be developed for clinical use, even if lugIEFGH could spread horizontally between different bacterial species. More detailed studies will be necessary to elucidate the molecular basis for the selectivity and elucidate if and which mutations in the self-resistance proteins might alter or broaden its preferences for peptide cargo.", "LugIEFGH has never been found outside the lug operon of S. lugdunensis, neither in S. aureus nor other nasal microbiome members. Only a few members of the Bacillales order, mainly from the environmental or intestinal bacterial genera Salinicoccus, Planococcus, Exiguobacterium, or Gracilibacillus, harbor homologs of the lugIEFGH cluster, albeit without the lugdunin biosynthesis genes. Additionally, Streptococcus mutans genomes encode an ABC transporter with homology to LugGH, but lack LugI or LugEF homologs. Despite its lower G+C content, the lug gene cluster does not seem to constitute a promiscuous genetic element, which may restrict its mobility among species other than S. lugdunensis."]
