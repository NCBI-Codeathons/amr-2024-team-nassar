["Discussion", "Allelopathy is a pervasive natural phenomenon in ecosystems, promoting and inhibiting the proliferation of diverse organisms. People have always been interested in the rational application of biocontrol's antagonistic effect on agricultural resistance and disease control. Tea plant diseases are difficult to control, resulting in substantial losses in yield and quality. Although chemical fungicides have some effect on the control of tea plant diseases, their misuse has resulted in severe environmental pollution issues. Utilizing biocontrol microorganisms to combat plant maladies is a popular topic of discussion. In certain instances, biocontrol microorganisms have been shown to be as effective as chemical fungicides in preventing plant diseases. Several bacterial species, such as Bacillus, Brevibacillus, and Pseudomonas, have been commercialized as biological control agents (Zhang et al., 2005; Paterson et al., 2017). Because of their extensive colonization capabilities, spore-forming Bacillus and Brevibacillus preparations are preferred for the development of commercial products. In this study, we isolated strain HNCS-1 of Br. brevis from tea garden soil that exhibits broad-spectrum resistance to five fungal diseases of tea plants. The HNCS-1 strain is a beneficial microorganism with prospective biotechnological application potential.", "The HNCS-1 strain and 17 Br. brevis isolates from NCBI were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis using orthologous genes organized into four clusters. However, the strains of the same cluster originate from diverse habitats, indicating that Br. brevis is highly adaptable to its environment and can populate a variety of ecological niches. We examined the pan-genome of Br. brevis species. The results indicate that the pan-genome of Br. brevis is open and theoretically infinite, indicating that Br. brevis species tend to acquire new genes to improve adaptability. Bacteria could modify their genetic material to adapt to varying environmental conditions, resulting in increased niche diversity and larger pan-genomes (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2004). The HNCS-1 strain has more protein-coding genes (6,342) than other Br. brevis strains, making it more environmentally adaptable.", "In addition, the traditional separation methods of antimicrobial substances have limitations. According to previous studies, this study tried to extract antimicrobial substances through the organic solvent extraction method, hydrochloric acid precipitation method, and ammonium sulfate precipitation method but never succeeded. Genome sequencing analysis and pan gene analysis open a new door for the identification of antimicrobial substances, which can quickly and accurately target antimicrobial substances and lay a theoretical foundation for the separation and application of antimicrobial substances.", "A comparison of Br. brevis HNCS-1 proteins with those of other Br. brevis strains revealed 3,742 core genes. There is only one NRPS gene cluster annotated as edeine in the core genes. It is demonstrated that edeine is the antibacterial peptide at the center of Br. brevis. After a blast comparison, it was determined that the gene cluster of the HNCS-1 strain was extremely similar to the Br. brevis Vm4 gene cluster for edeine NRPS (identity >97%). To validate the accuracy of comprehensive genomic analysis, we used the UHPLC-MS/MS technique to identify edeine A, B, and F from the crude extract of the HNCS-1 strain, with edeine B and edeine A serving as the principal AMPs. The main species of edeine in the HNCS-1 strain differ from Br. brevis X23 (Du et al., 2022), which may be owing to the evolutionary tree's distant genetic relationship.", "Edeine, as an AMP of the core genes of Br. brevis, should be abundant in the organism's secondary metabolites. Edeine was extracted from Br. brevis Vm4 and X23 by resin adsorption, respectively (Westman et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2022). However, ethylparaben from Br. brevis FJAT-0809-GLX was extracted by solvent extraction (Che et al., 2015), tostadin from Br. brevis XDH was extracted by ammonium sulfate precipitation (Song et al., 2012), siderophore from Br. brevis GZDF3 was extracted by ethanol precipitation (Sheng et al., 2020), and surfactin from Br. brevis KN8(2) was extracted by hydrochloric acid precipitation (Krishnan et al., 2019). The inability to extract edeine from the secondary metabolites of Br. brevis may have been caused by a mismatch in extraction techniques. Due to the ability of Br. brevis to acquire new genes from the environment, its antimicrobial peptides are diverse. The pan-genome analysis identified 560 HNCS-1 strain-specific genes. The unique genomes of the HNCS-1 strain require additional study. Additionally, genetic engineering is an excellent research direction. For instance, using in situ promoter engineering, the production of edeine in Br. brevis X23 was increased. Br. brevis HNCS-1 requires additional research, including the one strain many compounds approach (OSMAC) and genetic modification, to investigate novel compounds and yield enhancement."]
