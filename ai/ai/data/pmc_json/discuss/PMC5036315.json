["Discussion", "Glycopeptide resistance in pathogens and in S. coelicolor is mediated by the action of VanHAX. The expression of the vanHAX genes is regulated by the TCS VanRS, the genes of which are colocalized with vanHAX. In the presence of glycopeptides, VanS becomes autophosphorylated and phosphorylates VanR, which subsequently activates transcription of vanHAX. VanH, VanA, and VanH reprogram the biosynthesis of the PG precursors, resulting in lipid II with an N-terminal d-Ala-d-Lac depsipeptide instead of the normally occurring d-Ala-d-Ala termini, the target of the glycopeptides. A. balhimycina produces the vancomycin-like glycopeptide balhimycin and has to protect itself from the action of the glycopeptide.45 The genome of A. balhimycina includes vanHAXAb genes and vanRS-like genes (vnlRSAb). However, in contrast to other glycopeptide-resistant bacteria, the vanHAXAb genes in A. balhimycina are located 2 Mb apart from the vnlRSAb genes, which are part of the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster.40", "RT-PCR experiments revealed that VnlRAb is not involved in the activation of the vanHAXAb genes in A. balhimycina. Subsequent PG analyses confirmed that a vnlRAb deletion mutant cannot synthesize resistant muropeptides. Since vnlRAb is colocalized with the balhimycin biosynthetic genes, an alternative role of VnlRAb as regulator of balhimycin synthesis was assumed, but the deletion of the vnlRAb did not affect balhimycin production. Hence, VnlRAb is not the central regulator activating the vanHAXAb resistance genes or the balhimycin biosynthetic genes.", "To further investigate the potential target gene(s) of VnlRAb, we analyzed the transcription of vanYAb, which encodes a carboxypeptidase and which is located adjacent to the vnlRSAb genes in the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster.25 RT-PCR and RNA-seq analyses revealed that vanYAb expression was 25-fold decreased in A. balhimycina \u0394vnlRAb compared with A. balhimycina WT.", "VanYAb is a d,d-carboxypeptidase, which cleaves the endstanding d-Ala from lipid II, resulting in the formation of tetrapeptides.27 In contrast to other described carboxypeptidases,46 VanYAb has no d,d-carboxyesterase activity. The tetrapeptides are the substrates for the l,d-transpeptidase (Ldt), which subsequently cross-links the tetrapeptide acyl donors at the third AA. This results in PG with 3\u20133 cross-linked tetra- and tripeptides, which are devoid of the d-Ala-d-Ala-ending peptides, and which can therefore not serve as target of glycopeptides anymore.47 Investigations of the PG of A. balhimycina revealed the presence of 3\u20133 cross-linked tetra- and tripeptides.40,45 Furthermore, we could identify at least three ldt genes in the genome of A. balhimycina.45 We therefore speculate that by activating the expression of vanYAb, VnlRAb is involved in regulating an alternative, VanHAXAb-independent glycopeptide resistance mechanism in A. balhimycina. This fact is further confirmed by RT-PCR analysis, where it was shown that VanYAb is expressed in A. balhimycina \u0394vanHAXAb.40", "This observation is in accordance with the findings in Nonomuraea ATCC 39727, the producer of the dalbavancin precursor A40926. Nonomuraea ATCC 39727 does not encode VanHAX homologs, but possesses a VanY homolog (VanYn) for the synthesis of a resistant PG precursor.48 As described for A. balhimycina, VanYn cleaves the C-terminal d-Ala from the pentapeptide as well as from the d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptide. The tetrapeptides are subsequently cross-linked by Ldt, resulting in glycopeptide-resistant cell wall.47 The surprising features of VnlRAb are that although it does not regulate the transcription of the vanHAXAb genes in A. balhimycina, it is able to activate vanHAXSc transcription in S. coelicolor, and that it activates teicoplanin resistance in S. coelicolor.", "Activation of the vanHAXSc transcription can be explained by the binding of VnlRAb at the promoter region of vanHAXSc. Sequence comparison of the promoter regions of vanHAXSc and vanHAXAb not only revealed conserved motives but also some differences (data not shown). Although many attempts have been made to analyze putative promoter sequences in gel mobility assays, no shifts could be observed. This is probably due to the fact that after purification, the protein lost its functionality (data not shown). Therefore, determination of the exact binding motive of VnlRAb still requires alternative approaches.", "VnlRAb was not only able to restore vancomycin resistance in an S. coelicolor \u0394vanRSAb mutant after heterologous expression but it even conferred teicoplanin resistance to this mutant, although S. coelicolor WT is sensitive toward teicoplanin. Recent comparative study of the VanR-VanS systems from two Streptomyces strains, S. coelicolor and Streptomyces toyocaensis (the producer of the sugarless glycopeptide A47934), indicated that the glycopeptide antibiotic inducer specificity is determined solely by the differences between the AA sequences of the VanR-VanS TCS present in each strain rather than by any inherent differences in general cell properties, including cell wall structure and biosynthesis.42 On the one hand, the results obtained in this work support this finding; since vnlRAb is under the control of the ermEp* promoter, VnlRAb is constitutively expressed and activates the transcription of the vanHAXJKSc genes in S. coelicolor independent from the presence of any glycopeptide. The activation of vanHAXJKSc resulted in the synthesis of PG with pentapeptides ending on d-Ala-d-Lac depsipeptide, which are resistant against vancomycin and teicoplanin. On the other hand, the second explanation contradicts the work of Novotna et al.42; it is likely that VnlRAb activates the transcription of additional unknown genes, which mediate teicoplanin resistance.", "The diverse functionality of VnlRAb in the glycopeptide producer A. balhimycina and in the nonproducer S. coelicolor provides the starting point of evolutionary analyses of glycopeptide resistance. In pathogenic bacteria and in S. coelicolor of glycopeptides, resistance is strictly regulated and is induced by the presence of glycopeptides. In contrast, glycopeptide producers overcome this regulation not only by the constitutive expression of the vanHAX genes but also by the development of a vanHAX-independent resistance mechanism. However, the ability of VnlRAb to activate transcription of vanHAX in S. coelicolor is an indication of a common origin of the three glycopeptide resistance mechanisms, the inducible one, the constitutively expressed, and the vanHAX-independent mechanism. Whether and how the complex resistance mechanism has evolved in the glycopeptide producers and whether and how it was transferred into resistance pathogens have to be subjects of future investigation."]
