["4. Discussion", "The results obtained in the current work indicate that van genes are more widely distributed among bacteria than expected before: for the first time, van genes were discovered in the genomic records of organisms from still poorly studied classes such as Anaerolineae, Erysipelotrichia, and Ktedonobacteria. Most likely, the spread of van genes among these different bacteria was determined by multiple HGT events. This idea is not new [26,52,80,81], but the abundance of genomic data available now allows us to outline some of these HGT events more precisely. Although the overall picture is quite puzzling and we are only at the beginning of such types of investigations, in the discussion, we propose a speculative scenario of how van genes might have disseminated (Figure 6).", "As noted in the previous section, the most recent HGT event may have led to the transmission of van genes from actinobacteria to the Ktedonobacteria class and to some members of the Clostridia class (see scheme in Figure 6). The corresponding proteins did not diverge much from the actinobacterial ones and were found deep in the \u201ccore Actinobacteria\u201d clade (Figure 5). However, the G-C content of these van loci (<50%) is definitely lower than that of actinobacteria (>60%), indicating that the corresponding genes were eventually adapted to the translation machinery of the novel hosts. Most of these Ktedonobacteria and Clostridia spp. were isolated from soil biotopes [55], likely sharing their ecological niches with Actinobacteria spp.\u2014the source of van loci. Notable exceptions were Ox. pfennigii DSM 3222, isolated from cattle rumen [82] (a biotope also inhabited by different actinobacteria [83]), and Cli. tagluense CS002\u2014a causative agent of meat spoilage [84]. Although no MGE-related genes were discovered near van loci in Ox. pfennigii DSM 3222 and only a single ISNCY-family transposase was encoded near van loci in Cli. tagluense CS002, these examples chart new possible routes for the further spread of van genes in antropocenoses. The vehicle/vehicles of such putative HGT events remain elusive, although multiple genes for transposases and resolvases/recombinases/integrases were found to co-localize with van loci in these Ktedonobacteria and Clostridia spp. It seems that in all of these cases, van loci were located on the chromosome; consequently, it is also possible that MGE-related genes might have been partially or completely lost upon integration, eroding the genomic landscapes of putative vehicles carrying van genes.", "IS-like elements might have played some role in the HGT of van loci into Ktedonobacteria spp., since, in these microbes, an immense number of transposase genes and intact IS elements are found nearby. Notably, van loci in Ktedonobacteria spp. underwent peculiar modifications: genes coding for VanX were lost, while novel genes for other types of peptidases were gained. Some evidence exists that at least some of these new genes were introduced as \u201cpassenger genes\u201d in IS-like elements (see Section 3.3). As already mentioned above, Ktedonobacteria spp. have an actinomycete-like lifestyle [55]. Accordingly, these microbes might have recruited van loci for protection against dalbaheptide producers (inhabiting the same biotopes), self-immunity against certain endogenous secondary metabolites, or morphogenesis-related cell-wall remodeling. Overall, the case of van genes in Ktedonobacteria spp. is of utmost interest and requires further experimental investigation.", "Aside from VanHA sequences rooted deep in \u201cCore Actinobacteria\u201d, our reference tree demonstrated the presence of five well-defined clades (99% bootstrap support) and a monotaxon branch (Bed. massiliensis GM1). For further interpretation, we would like to make two assumptions: (a) each of these clades (and Bed. massiliensis GM1 branch) emerged as a result of a single HGT event from Actinobacteria; (b) the basal taxa of each clade represent a starting point in which van loci were delivered by an initial HGT event (before further spreading to the other taxa of the clade). Following these assumptions, an interesting speculative yet plausible scenario for van gene dissemination can be proposed (Figure 6).", "In clade (I), a HGT event likely introduced van loci to some Clostridia spp. since the basal taxon of this clade is Am. terrae CBA3637, belonging to the class Clostridia. Am. terrae CBA3637 was isolated from river sediments [85], which are also inhabited by a plethora of actinobacteria [86]. Further, van genes spread to other clade (I) taxa\u2014Tba. xylanilyticus XE and Paenibacillus spp. (Figure 6).", "Clade (II) points to several HGT events in addition to the putative initial one. Here, the majority of taxa belong to the Bacilli class. However, sequences from an Anaerolineae class bacterium\u2014Al. lenta MO-CFX2\u2014are positioned far from the base of clade (II), suggesting a putative HGT event delivering van genes from clade (II) Bacilli spp. to Al. lenta MO-CFX2. Notably, Al. lenta MO-CFX2 is the first reported Gram-negative bacterium [87] carrying van loci. The same scenario also works for the two Clostridia spp. found in clade (II)\u2014Clostridium sp. M3/9 and Cli. argentinense 113/29. In at least one clade (II) taxon, Bba. laterosporus B9, van loci are located on a plasmid, implying that a possible vehicle bringing van genes to clade (II) might have been a plasmid.", "Except for one, all taxa forming clade (III) belong to Clostridia spp. An exception is the VanHA sequences of Lct. caecimuris 3BBH23 from the Erysipelotrichia class, rooted deep in clade (III). Such a topology most likely indicates that Lct. caecimuris 3BBH23 received van loci from some clade (III) Clostridia spp. as a result of an additional HGT event (Figure 6). It is also important to note that van loci in the basal taxon of the clade (III)\u2014Lachnotalea sp. AF33-28\u2014are located downstream of an incomplete prophage region. Thus, the vehicles that delivered van genes to clade (III) organisms might have been some phages.", "VanHA sequences from the classes Bacilli, Erysipelotrichia, Clostridia and the phylum Actinobacteria composed clade (IV). The basal branch of clade (IV) was represented by sequences from [Clostridium] indolis DSM 755 and [Clostridium] methoxybenzovorans SR3, isolated from soil [88] and wastewater [89], respectively. No MGE-related genes accompanied van loci in these two organisms. However, in all of the other taxa of clade (III), van genes were found as a part of Tn1549-like transposons. Such evidence induces us to speculate that an unknown vehicle delivered van genes to [Clostridium] indolis DSM 755 and [Clostridium] methoxybenzovorans SR3 (or ancestral organisms) in an initial HGT event, leading to the emergence of clade (III) (Figure 6). In the following HGT events, van loci were mobilized by a Tn1549-like transposon and then spread to other clade (III) taxa. These taxa included several clinical and human isolates: an organism from the Erysipelotrichia class (Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 66202529), Cld. difficile AI0499, Clostridium sp. MLG245, several strains of enterococci, and the actinobacterium Atpb. minutum 10063974 (Figure 6). Overall, we might conclude that two bacteria from the Erysipelotrichia class obtained van genes in two independent HGT events, while the Tn1549-like transposon mediated the reverse transition of van genes to the Actinobacteria phylum in the case of Atpb. minutum 10063974.", "Unlike all other clades, clade (V) was composed exclusively of Bacilli spp. The basal taxa of clade (V) were mostly soil dwellers and did not show any clear repetitive patterns of MGE-related genes co-localized with van loci (Figure 5). Herein, subclade (V\u2019) was the most interesting, being composed principally of VanHA sequences encoded on plasmids carrying Tn1546-like transposons from different clinical isolates of staphylococci and enterococci. At the basal branch of subclade (V\u2019), there are VanHA sequences from a clinical isolate of the soil-dwelling opportunistic human pathogen B. circulans VR0709 [50]. Overall, the topology of clade (V) suggests that an unknown vehicle delivered van loci to B. circulans VR0709 from a gene pool existing in basal clade (V) taxa. Consequentially, a Tn1546-containing plasmid mobilized van loci from B. circulans VR0709 and mediated further dissemination in nosocomial environments among staphylococci and enterococci (Figure 6). This last observation actually corroborates a previous conclusion made from a phylogenetic analysis conducted more than ten years ago on a less extensive sample of available van gene sequences [80].", "Finally, we would also like to comment on van genes from the two actinobacterial strains\u2014Prv. caecicola DSM 22242 and Enr. mucosicola NM66_B29. VanHA sequences from these two organisms were the most divergent, being an outgroup for our reference tree (Figure 5). In our previous work, we demonstrated that van loci in Prv. caecicola DSM 22242 and Enr. mucosicola NM66_B29 are co-localized with an assemblage of MGE-related genes resembling a transposon of unknown type [25]. Notably, both strains were isolated from the intestines of laboratory mice [90,91]. Keeping in mind the case of Atpb. minutum 10063974 (see above), it is tempting to suppose that Prv. caecicola DSM 22242 and Enr. mucosicola NM66_B29 represent another example of a reverse HGT event that brought van genes back to the Actinobacteria phylum. However, the source of the putative transposons found in Prv. caecicola DSM 22242 and Enr. mucosicola NM66_B29 remains unknown (Figure 6).", "Our results demonstrate that van genes from the Actinobacteria phylum represent an interesting and widespread part of the Terrabacteria mobilome. The flow of van genes is a continuous process that occurs actively, as demonstrated by the example of Ktedonobacteria spp. Likely carried by different vehicles, van genes spread from one taxon to another, creating a puzzling network of consequential HGT events (Figure 6). Bacteria from the Bacilli and Clostridia classes play an important role in the spread of van genes and might represent their source for classes such as Anaerolineae and Erysipelotrichia. We are aware that our scenario depicting the spread of vanHAX genes is speculative and that it will probably change when more genomic information becomes available. However, we believe that at the current point, it provides a useful interpretation of the overall picture to start from in future investigations."]
