["Discussion", "Bacteria need to be highly competitive to colonize the desired ecological niche to gain access to nutrients and space. The Pp and Pc subgroup bacteria studied here are known to rely on large-spectrum antimicrobials to target genetically disparate microbial competitors7. Close relatives are, like the producers, generally insensitive to these toxic molecules43\u201345. However, bacteria are not only in competition with distant or non-related microorganisms but also with their own kin since phylogenetically closely-related bacteria share most of their genetic content and likely compete for the same ecological niches. Competition against kin bacteria requires highly specific mechanisms as to outcompete kin but not kill individuals from the same clonal population (i.e., strains that have identical genomes). This implies that the arsenal used against kin needs to be highly specialized with a narrow activity spectrum. Viral particles, such as bacteriophages, are known to have a narrow activity spectrum in addition to a specific host spectrum15. The findings of our present work on plant-beneficial strains of the Pp and Pc subgroups of Pseudomonas are in line with previous work supporting that environmentally and medically important pseudomonads use viral particles (and particularly R-tailocins encoded within their genomes as specialized weapons against kin bacteria23,25,28,29,33. Kin discrimination mediated by viral particles was recently described between different strains of P. aeruginosa62. Importantly, our live cell imaging work now provides unprecedented insight into the dynamic of production and release of R-tailocins as well as demonstrating their implication in the competition between kin bacteria.", "We tagged the tail of the viral particles in C-terminal to be able to monitor the production dynamic of R-tailocins. In most studies that have worked with tagged phages, the capsid or the DNA of these particles were tagged46\u201349, however since R-tailocins resemble headless phage particles, we decided to tag the subunit of the tail sheath. Importantly, tagged R-tailocins were expressed from their native chromosomal and thus regulation context. Nonetheless, we found that the labels used had an impact on the overall structure of the tail and inhibited the correct activity of the R-tailocin, presumably by obstructing efficient contraction (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02, Supplementary Table\u00a05). Nevertheless, these fluorescent labels allowed us to visualize the production dynamic of such particles inside induced P. protegens CHA0 cells. Surprisingly, the R-tailocins are produced in a sequential manner: originating from the cell center and migrating to the cell poles (Fig.\u00a04, Supplementary Movies\u00a01, 2, 3). This localization could be mediated by various mechanisms that are involved in the polar transport of proteins. Proteins are known to move to cell poles by passive diffusion, by specific affinity to curved membranes or affinity for cell envelope elements or by using gradients such as the one created by the Min system required for cell division site placement50. Phage particles have also been shown to travel along tubulin structures for translocation to subcellular compartments51,52. Furthermore, it has been reported that during the lytic cycle of the \u03bb phage in Escherichia coli, the phage DNA preferentially locates at the cell poles46. Therefore, it is most likely that the polarized transport of R-tailocins is an active mechanism that would allow further propagation of the particles to reach further cells.", "The labeling of these viral particles also allowed us to demonstrate that following explosive cell lysis, R-tailocins are thrusted up to several tens of micrometers into the environment where they can reach and kill kin competitor (Figs.\u00a04, 5, Supplementary Movies\u00a03, 4, 5). Explosive cell lysis mediated by an endolysin encoded in the pyocin (tailocin) gene cluster of P. aeruginosa has recently been identified as a mechanism for the formation of membrane vesicles and release of eDNA but so far has not been linked to the release of tailocins53,54. The turgor pressure in bacterial cells has been estimated up to 1.9\u2009MPa (in comparison a car tire is inflated at ca. 0.2\u2009MPa)55,56. This suggests that the explosive disintegration of the bacterial cell wall could liberate sufficient energy to eject the tailocins at the distances observed. Here, we demonstrated that following explosive lysis of cells and viral particle ejection, tailocin #1 is a targeted and efficient microscale weapon against the kin competitor, both in non-induced condition and upon artificial induction by MMC. Indeed, through different time-lapse experiments, we monitored the competition between Pf-5 and various non-induced variants of CHA0 and evidenced the specific role of tailocin #1 of CHA0 against Pf-5 (Fig.\u00a06b, Supplementary Movie\u00a07). We showed that following the release of tailocin #1 from CHA0, closely located Pf-5 cells are killed. We confirmed this hypothesis by artificially inducing the production of these viral particles with MMC and observed a greater impact on this sensitive strain (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b, Supplementary Movie\u00a010). Presently, it is difficult to speculate on possible factors inducing R-tailocin release even in non-artificially induced CHA0 cells during competition with kin competitor Pf-5, but it seems likely that a mechanism of interference competition sensing is involved, such as sensing of DNA damage, membrane perturbation or nutrient shortage caused by the competitor attacks57,58. Nevertheless, albeit R-tailocins play a major role in competition at cellular level, their impact is less readily visible following prolonged competition in classical confrontation assays in liquid or on solid media (Fig.\u00a07). We suggest that R-tailocins are more likely an altruistic rather than a spiteful weapon, reducing the invasion from a kin at a microscale level. However, in the micro-environment of a cell deploying its R-tailocin weaponry the consequences for sensitive kin cells are fatal. This may be particularly relevant in a biofilm or microcolony environment where R-tailocins may serve as specialized and targeted weapons to hold off competitors from invading discrete colonization sites. In contrary to time-lapse microscopy analyses as done here, classical confrontation assays combined with CFU counting seem therefore inapt to fully image the subtle localized effects of the phage-like weaponry of these environmental bacteria.", "Although we were able to study in depth the effect of tailocin #1 of CHA0 on Pf-5, we also identified three other viral particle sequences in the genome of CHA0. Interestingly, we found that two out of the four viral particles have very specialized activity spectra affecting either strains from the P. protegens sensu stricto species (siphovirus) or strains belonging to the P. protegens subgroup (tailocin #1) (Fig.\u00a02a). However, we did not find any targets for the two remaining viral particles. Since tailocin #2 was visualized with TEM (Fig.\u00a02b) and found in all genomes of Pseudomonas in this study (Fig.\u00a03b), we hypothesize that this R-tailocin has a different activity spectrum affecting strains that do not belong to the ones tested. R-tailocins targeting phylogenetically distant species that may occupy the same ecological niche have been reported for other environmental bacteria, including Pseudomonas putida28, P. fluorescens34 and Xenorhabdus nematophila59. Tailocin #2 of CHA0 should be tested on more distantly-related strains to find targets. Conversely, the myovirus was not detected following viral particle extraction, which explains the inefficiency of extracts towards the selected Pseudomonas. We suggest that the myovirus is a cryptic phage, which is a prophage that is no longer able to induce the lysis of its bacterial host and produce phage particles60. This is most likely due to genome rearrangements and degeneration of genetic content61. We further supported our hypothesis of specialization of viral particles by demonstrating that all viral particles extracted from one strain have more of a lytic effect on other strains belonging to the same subgroup (Fig.\u00a01). As previously mentioned, this may be a mechanism to prevent kin bacteria from invading an already established population, as it was described for P. aeruginosa biofilms, in which strains that harbor viral particles had a competitive advantage over those who lacked viral particles62.", "Accordingly, the presence of viral particles, more specifically R-tailocins, is not uncommon in Pseudomonas genomes. In the 25 genomes tested in this study, we found a tailocin hotspot region, between mutS and cinA/recA, which was previously identified as a R-tailocin gene cluster insertion site in some other environmental pseudomonads, including strains of the P. putida and P. fluorescens groups28,31. Within this hotspot, we found that there was at least one R-tailocin, namely tailocin #2 of CHA0 that was conserved among all the Pseudomonas tested (Fig.\u00a03). Interestingly, this particular R-tailocin was also identified in genomes of more distantly-related Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas corrugata, Pseudomonas korensis, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas syringae24,29,31, suggesting that the original prophage giving rise to this specific R-tailocin may have been acquired by a common ancestor of all these Pseudomonas. However, genetic differences occurred, specifically for the genes encoding the tail fibers, involved in the cell target recognition. Furthermore, it appears that the other tailocins identified in the selected genomes are specific to each subgroup (Fig.\u00a03b). One of the most simple evolutionary scenarios could be that multiple temperate phages were independently acquired, leading to different tailocins through evolution. This hypothesis could be supported by the undomesticated prophage present in the genome of P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens strain O619,20,28 that may evolve into a tailocin. Furthermore, as these tailocins may be acquired independently, they have a narrow and specific activity spectrum that may have been obtained through the specificity of the prophage but may also have evolved following acquisition. When compiling all this genomic information, we suggest that prophage domestication by bacteria could be a multi-step evolutionary process19,20 in conjunction with horizontal gene transfers and recombination between different prophages22. Following these steps, the resulting tailocins may be specialized through the genetic modifications of key genes involved in specificity such as the tail fibers, to become precise weapons.", "Based on the results of present study, we propose a model where certain R-tailocins are targeted and efficient weapons in microscale competitions between kin bacteria (Fig.\u00a08). We suggest that R-tailocins are induced either spontaneously or by external stressors, including interference competition signals57,58 or competitor toxins63. Following induction, R-tailocins are synthesized at the center of the cell and migrate to the cell poles. Once R-tailocins have migrated, producing cells are lysed in a two-step process, firstly by forming spheroblasts and secondly through complete lysis of the cells. Following explosive lysis, the viral particles are thrusted into the environment where they reach competing bacteria. R-tailocins specifically bind and kill kin bacteria that are ecological niche competitors while exempting more distantly-related strains. This kin-exclusion may allow the reduction of kin bacteria and may favor the input of more phylogenetically distant bacteria that bring new genes involved in different metabolic pathways that would increase the diversity of public goods within the community. Furthermore, clonal cells are not disturbed by the R-tailocins in the environment as bacteria seem to be immune to their own R-tailocins.Fig. 8Model of the ecological role of R-tailocins in interbacterial competitiveness.We propose a model where R-tailocins play an important ecological role within a bacterial community such as the ones that compose biofilms. 1 Some cells are induced upon environmental stress and synthesize R-tailocins that are produced at the center of the cell and migrate to the cell poles. 2 Subsequently to the migration of the R-tailocins, the cells lyses, firstly by forming a spheroblast. 3 Secondly, the cell lyses completely and explosively, thereby thrusting its R-tailocins in the environment. 4 Once in the medium, R-tailocins specifically bind to kin bacteria and kill them whereas more distantly-related bacteria are spared. 5 Clonal cells are immune and are therefore protected from the R-tailocins released in the environment.", "Fig. 8Model of the ecological role of R-tailocins in interbacterial competitiveness.We propose a model where R-tailocins play an important ecological role within a bacterial community such as the ones that compose biofilms. 1 Some cells are induced upon environmental stress and synthesize R-tailocins that are produced at the center of the cell and migrate to the cell poles. 2 Subsequently to the migration of the R-tailocins, the cells lyses, firstly by forming a spheroblast. 3 Secondly, the cell lyses completely and explosively, thereby thrusting its R-tailocins in the environment. 4 Once in the medium, R-tailocins specifically bind to kin bacteria and kill them whereas more distantly-related bacteria are spared. 5 Clonal cells are immune and are therefore protected from the R-tailocins released in the environment.", "Model of the ecological role of R-tailocins in interbacterial competitiveness.", "We propose a model where R-tailocins play an important ecological role within a bacterial community such as the ones that compose biofilms. 1 Some cells are induced upon environmental stress and synthesize R-tailocins that are produced at the center of the cell and migrate to the cell poles. 2 Subsequently to the migration of the R-tailocins, the cells lyses, firstly by forming a spheroblast. 3 Secondly, the cell lyses completely and explosively, thereby thrusting its R-tailocins in the environment. 4 Once in the medium, R-tailocins specifically bind to kin bacteria and kill them whereas more distantly-related bacteria are spared. 5 Clonal cells are immune and are therefore protected from the R-tailocins released in the environment.", "To conclude, tailocins and viral particles are likely to participate in the localized \u201ccell-to-cell\u201d competition of bacteria. Learning more about these intriguing viral particles could give us better insight into the complex relationships within bacterial communities. The findings of this study provide a basis for follow-up work into signaling and regulatory mechanisms controlling the induction and formation of these phage tail-like devices, and molecular determinants that sensitize or shield targeted cells against these bacterial weapons."]
