["DISCUSSION", "JMT is a traditional Chinese compound prescription developed by the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). It consists of 12 crude drug materials, including the seeds of Cuscuta chinensis Lam., the seeds of Ligustrum lucidum Ait., the herb of Eclipta prostrata L., the herb of Prunella vulgaris L., the seeds of Litchi chinensis Sonn., Buthus martensii K., the tender stem of Cinnamomum cassia Presl., the rhizoma of Corydalis yanhusuo W. T. Wang, the seeds of Prunus persica L., the seeds of Cassia obtusifolia L, the radix and rhizoma of Asarum heterotropiodes F., and Hirudo\u2002nipponica\u2002W [21]. In our previous study, we identified 72 chemical components of JMT using UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis, and found that it is composed mainly of flavonoid and its glycosides, triterpenoids, and phenolic acids [14]. Growing evidence indicates that these active components have anti-oxidative, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetes, and neuroprotective effects according to the pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica and recent pharmacological researches [14].", "JMT not only alleviated peripheral nerve injury as evidenced by improved mechanical withdrawal and warm thermal perception thresholds in STZ-induced DPN rats [20], but also ameliorated the clinical symptoms of DPN patients in double-blind, randomized clinical studies as evidenced by improved lipid metabolism and increased nerve conduction velocities [23]. Our previous in vivo experiments showed that JMT can inhibit DNA oxidative damage and apoptosis [22], as well as thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation [33] in the sciatic nerves of STZ-induced DPN rats. In the same rat DPN model, JMT also promoted the expression of nerve growth factors [20, 21], insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and their receptors [14] in the sciatic nerves. Finally, our previous in vitro work showed that JMT and its active components promoted cell proliferation [17, 34] and autophagy [35, 36] and inhibited inflammation [15, 17] and apoptosis [37] in high-glucose cultured Schwann cells and dorsal ganglion neurons.", "In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of JMT in STZ-induced DPN rats, a widely used rat model of diabetes and diabetic complications [38]. Distilled water-treated DPN rats all developed classical DPN phenotypes characterized by hyperglycemia, decreased body weight, reduced MWT, and decreased IENFD. DPN rats also exhibited severely damaged myelin and axons in the sciatic nerves, which was accompanied by increased APP expression, and decreases in Caspr-expressing paranode percentages and serum NRG1 levels. These results indicated that hyperglycemia damaged the myelin and axon structures and inhibited their functions by inhibiting serum neurotrophic factor NRG1 expression, destroying Caspr-expressing paranodal structures, and promoting amyloid precursor protein accumulation in the sciatic nerves of distilled water-treated DPN rats.", "Interestingly, JMT alleviated the DPN phenotypes by increasing both MWT and IENFD; NTP, which served as a positive control, increased MWT but not IENFD. Neither JMT nor NTP affected non-fasting blood glucose level or body weight in DPN rats, indicating that JMT and NTP may serve as useful adjuvants for antidiabetic drugs in DPN patients even if they cannot replace hypoglycemic drugs in clinical application.", "In addition, morphological data from HE staining and TEM images indicated that JMT ameliorated the peripheral nerve damage in DPN rats by increasing axonal myelination and decreasing the percentage of abnormal fibers. The ELISA result showed that JMT rescued the serum NRG1 level of DPN rats. Therefore, we speculated that JMT might restore myelin structure by promoting serum NRG1 secretion, increasing the number and percentage of Caspr-positive paranodes, and inhibiting amyloid precursor protein accumulation in the sciatic nerves of DPN rats.", "A growing number of studies have demonstrated important connections between gut microbiota and diabetic hosts [39], and gut microbiota dysbiosis can drive T2DM pathogenesis [40]. Consisted with the highly valued function of balanced microbiota compositions in T2DM, here, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that distilled water-treated DPN rats also showed gut dysbiosis compared to normal control rats. LEfSe analysis identified ten enriched species in the distilled water-treated DPN group that are also abundant in diabetes patients [41, 42] and diabetic rodent models [43, 44], and are positively correlated with fasting blood glucose level [45]. Among them, f_Porphyromonadaceae and g_Prevotella were negatively correlated with body weight, IENFD, MWT and serum NRG1 level, indicating that these two species might promote the pathogenesis of DPN and inhibit NRG1 secretion. Other reports have shown that f_Porphyromonadaceae is enriched in diabetic-sensitive mice and associated with a high-fat diet-induced metabolic changes [46], while g_Prevotella is enriched in rats with advanced-stage type 1 diabetes [47]; these findings agree with our current results.", "Interestingly, JMT reversed gut microbial dysbiosis by restoring nine species to levels observed in normal control rats. Though few reports have examined the relationship between these species and DPN or diabetes, some of them are beneficial in treating other intestinal diseases; Helicobacteraceae was effective against colitis-associated colorectal cancer [48], and the Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter\npylori helped prevent and treat inflammatory bowel diseases [49]. Among the nine species enriched in JMT-treated DPN rats, p_Actinobacteria, p_Proteobacteria, and c_Actinobacteria were positively correlated with body weight, IENFD, MWT, and NRG1 level, but negatively correlated with non-fasting blood glucose level. Therefore, we speculated that they may help ameliorate DPN phenotypes associated with increased NRG1 levels. Studies show that Actinobacteria also has beneficial effects in T2DM after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [50] and in obesity patients on a high-fermentable fiber diet with inulin [51]. Some reports also suggest that Actinobacteria plays an antidepressant role in inflammatory models [52] and has anti-tumor effects [53]. These researches support the beneficial role of Actinobacteria in human health.", "Based on the studies and results discussed above, we hypothesize that JMT might ameliorate DPN phenotypes by enriching Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria at the phylum level and Actinobacteria at the class level; these microbiota abundances were positively correlated with body weight, MWT, IENFD, and serum NRG1 level and negatively correlated with non-fasting blood glucose level. By promoting serum NRG1 secretion in DPN rats, these taxa restored Caspr-positive paranodal structures, and decreased amyloid precursor protein accumulation in the sciatic nerves of DPN rats. They also increased the density of protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5)-positive intraepidermal nerve fibers in the plantar skin and improved MWT in the sciatic nerves, and finally ameliorated hyperpathia in DPN rats. These changes might explain the JMT-induced reversal of DPN phenotypes and provide innovative insights on the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms of JMT (Figure 9).", "Figure 9Proposed mechanism for JMT-induced changes in gut microbiota composition that ameliorated DPN.", "Proposed mechanism for JMT-induced changes in gut microbiota composition that ameliorated DPN.", "This study identified differences in gut microbiota composition between DPN rats and normal control rats and to report that JMT exerts neuroprotective effects by modulating gut microbiota for the first time. The relationship between the identified bacterial taxa and DPN phenotypes and NRG1 levels provides new scientific evidence for the clinical application of JMT in treating DPN patients. However, some limitations of the present study should be addressed in future research. First, knockdown and overexpression models could be used to confirm the effects of genes and signaling pathways related to DPN and NRG1. Second, fecal transplants of the \u2018pathogenic bacterias\u2019 or \u2018probiotics\u2019 identified here could be applied in DPN rat models. Third, a combined multi-omics approach including both microbial metabolomics and proteomics might prove useful. Fourth, the screening of novel neuroprotective components from JMT should be taken into account in our future research. In the future, we plan on conducting comprehensive studies using transgenic mice, behavior studies, electrophysiology, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabonomics, and fecal transplants to further investigate the effects of JMT and screening the key effective components from JMT in diabetes and its complications."]
