["Discussion", "Y. ruckeri causes ERM in channel catfish and can lead to rapid death of this aquatic species ultimately resulting in heavy economic burdens. Both antibacterial treatment and vaccine prevention are used to control disease caused by Y. ruckeri (4, 6, 50, 51). Generally, vaccination is the most effective means of disease prevention in aquaculture. However, this method is very stressful for fish and labor-intensive for farmers (6). Traditionally, the infection rate from bacterial pathogens in aquaculture mainly depended on the use of antibiotics and antibacterial compounds (4). However, due to the high usage of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance and the safety problems related to antibiotic residues are an issue. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the mechanisms behind Y. ruckeri invasion of its host and its interaction with a host to provide a theoretical basis for finding gene targets to block bacterial invasion, reduce toxicity and strengthen host immune surveillance.", "The interaction between the host and pathogen during infection is complex. During the different stages of infection, transcriptome changes occur in both the host and the pathogen. Not only is trunk kidney an important immune organ, it is also an important excretory organ in fish. At the same time, the trunk kidney is also the main organ infected in Y. ruckeri (6). Selecting the trunk kidney as the tissue analyzed during dual RNA-seq sequencing not only reflects the interaction between the host and pathogen, but also detects possible damage to the trunk kidney of channel catfish caused by Y. ruckeri, to provide basis for formulating prevention and control measures.", "In this study, we investigated transcriptome changes in the trunk kidney and pathogen at different time points after channel catfish inoculation with Y. ruckeri. The number of DEGs in the trunk kidney and Y. ruckeri changed at the three different time points, but the overall change in the host was small at three time points, where 9000 genes with significant differences were enriched. However, at the 6 hpi point, genes related to innate immunity were enriched, including IL-20-like and IL-1\u03b2. There was a significantly higher number of down-regulated genes compared to upregulated genes in the pathogen, and this difference was most obvious at 24 hpi. However, OMPF genes, which are important bacterial antigens, were significantly enriched at all three time points (50). These results indicate that there is a strong immune response between the host and pathogen when Y. ruckeri infects channel catfish.", "Host innate immunity uses a variety of recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors, to recognize bacteria (52\u201354). Transcriptomic analysis of Oreochromis niloticus during Streptococcus agalactiae infection showed that toll-like receptor-mediated pathways contribute to immune responses and protect the host against pathogens (55). The expression levels of many genes in \u201ctoll-like receptor signaling pathway\u201d were significantly upregulated in large yellow croakers infected with pseudomonas mutants at 4 dpi (56). The results of this study showed that the expression levels of 58 differential genes in toll-like receptor signaling pathways were significantly upregulated at the onset of infection (6 hpi). Cytokines are key modulators of the host defense in innate immunity and adaptive inflammation (57). Cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, NF-Kappa B signaling pathways, important innate immune pathways such as the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and the TNF signaling pathway were significantly enriched at 6-24 hpi, consistent with previous studies (58\u201361). When these pathways are significantly enriched, the fish produces an acute inflammatory response to protect itself and enhance its tissue repair and defense during infection. These results showed that the immune response of channel catfish increases during the progression of Y. ruckeri infection.", "Metabolic regulation of the host is also very important in the process of infection. The immune system needs energy to resist pathogens and maintain tissue homeostasis (62, 63). To overcome stress caused by the pathogen, the infected fish expends a large amount of energy (64). Amino acid metabolism is important for host energy consumption, detoxification, protein synthesis and safe operation of innate immune responses (65). Through KEGG enrichment, all pathways enriched at 6-12 hpi are related to immunity. At 24 hpi, many metabolic pathways are enriched, such as fatty acid, glycine, serine and threonine and butanoate metabolism pathways. It is speculated that when channel catfish are infected by Y. ruckeri, the acute immune response begins immediately. As the first line barrier, innate immune-related molecules and pathways are rapidly expressed. With more serious and progressed infection, channel catfish require fatty acid and amino acid metabolism to provide energy and proteins. Changes in tryptophan metabolism were also observed in many fish such as zebrafish, large yellow cordon, Atlantic salmon and abalone, indicating that tryptophan and its metabolites may play an important role in the immune system of aquatic animals (66\u201368).", "For pathogens that invade the host, flagella play a key role, including colonizing and invading the host, reaching the optimal host site, maintaining the infection site and spreading after infection (69\u201371). To date, flagella have been implicated in the virulence of many aquatic pathogenic bacteria, such as Y. ruckeri (46, 72), Edwardsiella tarda (73), and Vibrio anguillarum (74). In this study, the flagellar gene fliC was significantly upregulated from 6-24 hpi, indicating that it was involved in the infection process of Y. ruckeri (72). KEGG was significantly enriched in the two-component system of Y. ruckeri at 6-12 hpi. This indicates that the bacteria adapt to the state of the fish by sensing environmental changes, regulating the expression of survival and virulence factors and maintaining their own survival (23). At 24 hpi, the gene expression levels of the bacterial two-component system decreased, indicating that the pathogen adapted to the fish environment and the host developed symptoms and began to due. At the same time, the pathogen was significantly enriched in the sucrose of bacterial secretion system, ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, one carbon pool by folate and other signaling pathways (75). These results indicated that the pathogen used its secretory system to escape and consume energy during the invasion process.", "WGCNA was divided into 19 modules and the results showed that the relationship between the host and pathogen is very complex. The turquoise module was considered to be the most important in the infection process, showing the dynamic process of the life-and-death struggle between the host and the pathogen, reflecting how the innate immunity of the host copes with pathogen invasion and how the pathogen achieves immune escape. In the interaction network diagram, 50 pathogenic genes were found to be associated with the host immune response. The pathogen mainly relied on SpaR and SpaP for immune escape through the type II secretion system, which has not been identified in previous studies (76, 77). The pathogen HlyB was up-regulated in the infection, indicating that the pathogen rely on hemolysin to cause harm\nin the host trunk kidney. The uvry regulatory gene and flagella transcriptional regulator flhd were also significantly down-regulated, consistent with previous studies that uvry gene mutations did not affect the survival rate of Y. ruckeri in fish (23), Therefore, the pathogen mainly depended on fliC flagellin for attachment and virulence. With progression of the infection, the expression of the multidrug resistant proteins mdtc and MDTA were seriously inhibited, suggesting that the drug resistance of the strains decreased.", "Here, we successfully used tissue dual RNA-seq to simultaneously analyze the dynamics of gene expression changes in both the host and pathogen and obtained high-resolution transcriptome data. For the host, innate immunity is an important means to resist bacterial invasion and bacterial flagella is an important tool for infection used by the pathogen. WGCNA reveals the strong interaction and relationship between the host and pathogen genomes throughout the infection process, which is most closely related to metabolic activities. This study has important theoretical significance for understanding the pathogenesis of channel catfish ERM."]
