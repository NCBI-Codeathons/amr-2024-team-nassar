["Discussion", "X. nematophila YL001 is a valuable producer of natural compounds with pesticidal properties. Its fermentation broth was indicated to possess strong antimicrobial activity against some plant pathogens in vitro and in vivo, including P. infestans and B. cinerea (Guo et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018). Additionally, several pesticidal compounds have been identified from other X. nematophila stains, such as xenocoumacins (McInerney et al., 1991; Yang et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2016), nematophin (Li et al., 1997a,b), PAX (peptide-antimicrobial-Xenorhabdus) peptides (Gualtieri et al., 2009; Fuchs et al., 2011), benzylideneacetone (Ji et al., 2004), xenortides, and xenematides (Lang et al., 2008). Xenocoumacins and nematophin were also present in the culture supernatant of X. nematophila YL001, which was confirmed by the HPLC-MS analysis in our previous study (Guo et al., 2017). Based on this, we try to isolate and identify new metabolites from the strain of X. nematophila YL001. In the present study, three dipeptide compounds were isolated and identified from the cell-free culture. NEP-1 is an antibiotic which was first isolated from strain X. nematophila BC1 (Li et al., 1997a). PDKP, a cyclodipeptide of proline and glycine, has been isolated previously from a sea marine sponge of undescribed species of Callyspongia (Chen et al., 2014), as well as many microorganisms such as Quambalaria cyanescens (Bishay et al., 2018) and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Li et al., 2018). MDKP, a dimethylated cyclodipeptide of phenylalanine and leucine, was first synthesized by Nakao et al. (2016) and its core structure piperazine-2,5-dione was found in a variety of natural products from fungi, bacteria, plants, and mammals (Borthwick, 2012). Despite this, to the best of our knowledge, it was first identified as a natural compound in this study. Moreover, this is also the first report of the presence of PDKP and MDKP in the X. nematophila fermentation broth. To gain more information about their pesticidal properties, we also evaluated their antimicrobial activity against 10 common phytopathogens. NEP-1 was demonstrated to possess a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro (Table 1) and high control efficacy against R. solani in vivo (Figures 3, 4). Despite the weak antimicrobial activity against the selected plant pathogens, PDKP was determined to be a potent acaricide against Tetranychus urticae with a LC50 value of 95.96 \u03bcg/ml in a recent study (Li et al., 2018). MDKP was proved to have moderate antifungal activity against E. turcicum (Table 1). These results reveal the potential value of the three compounds in the crop protection.", "The biosynthetic origin of (\u00b1)-nematophin (NEP-1) may be involved in two pathways in X. nematophila (Figure 8). The CD spectra (Supplementary Figure S2) and specific rotation of NEP-1, -2, and -3 reveal that NEP-1 is an enantiomeric mixture of nematophin, denying the previous inference that the natural nematophin is an enantiomer of (S)-configuration (Paik et al., 2003). Based on the biosynthetic process of nematophin, we deduced two possible pathways relevant to the formation of NEP-1. One is that (+)-nematophin (NEP-3) is derived from L-isoleucine (L-Ile) via the aminotransferase to generate 2-keto-3S-methylvaleric acid (S-KMVA) (Mamer, 2001), followed by enolization-induced racemization to form the nematophin stereoisomers in vivo. Previous studies revealed that the racemization of S-KMVA did not occur in vivo, and that L-alloisoleucine (L-allo-Ile) was derived from L-Ile rather than R-KMVA (Mamer and Reimer, 1992; Mamer and L\u00e9pine, 1996). Thus, the other pathway may be that NEP-1 is derived from the authigenic L-Ile and L-allo-Ile, which can be converted to S-KMVA and R-KMVA, respectively. Conversion of L-Ile to L-allo-Ile was verified in bacteria, fungi, plants and mammalian systems and L-allo-Ile is also present in many natural cyclic peptide antibiotics (Mamer, 2001; Li et al., 2016), providing evidence for the second pathway. However, the actual mechanism of the racemization needs further clarification.", "Figure 8Two deductive pathways involved in the biosynthetic origin of (\u00b1)-nematophin (NEP-1).", "Two deductive pathways involved in the biosynthetic origin of (\u00b1)-nematophin (NEP-1).", "NEP-1 has great potential to be developed as a new biopesticide for agricultural production. NEP-1 not only represented broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against 10 agricultural pathogenic fungi and oomycetes in vitro (Table 1) but also exerted a comparable control efficacy against R. solani in vivo at 1,000 \u03bcg/ml to MBC at 500 \u03bcg/ml on the rice plants (Figure 4). Moreover, NEP-1 could also inhibit the sclerotial formation, maturation and germination of R. solani substantially even at a low concentration (15 \u03bcg/ml) (Supplementary Figures S4, S5), beneficial to control the disease extension during its epidemic period and its outbreak in the next year effectively. Besides high bioactivity (in vitro and in vivo), easy production at an industrial scale is also another key factor affecting the development of a microbial pesticide (Montesinos, 2003). NEP-1 and its analogs can be synthesized through chemical methods due to its simple structure (Li et al., 1997b). In addition, researchers have also illuminated its biosynthesis pathway and achieved its heterologous production in Escherichia coli (Cai et al., 2017). In this paper, we also synthesized an enantiomeric mixture of nematophin (NEP-2) and its (S)-configuration structure (NEP-3), with high yields and easy operating conditions. The ultrastructure data suggest that NEP-1 may diffuse into the exposed cells and then disrupt the cells by altering the subcellular structures, especially the mitochondrial structure, which are similar to those induced by camptothecin (CPT) against R. solani, indicating that they may possess a similar antifungal mechanism (Sirikantaramas et al., 2008; Dai et al., 2017). However, more work is needed to explore the effects of NEP-1 on the mitochondria-related pathways of R. solani to further clarify its mechanism of action as a potent antifungal agent."]
