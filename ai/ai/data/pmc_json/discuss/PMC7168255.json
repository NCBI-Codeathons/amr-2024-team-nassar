["2. Discussion", "The model strain S. coelicolor is extensively used to study the regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis, since it produces abundantly three well characterized antibiotics: the colorless ionophore peptide Calcium Dependent Antibiotic CDA [15], the red pyrrole hybrid peptide/polyketide antibiotic undecylprodigiosin RED [16], and the blue pigmented polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin ACT [17]. The first antibiotic to be synthetized by S. coelicolor, in condition of phosphate limitation, is CDA [15]. The synthesis of CDA coincides with the transition phase, a phase of growth arrest characterized by extensive breakage of cellular macromolecules [18]. The production of RED [16,19] occurs a bit later, just before the entry into stationary phase, whereas that of ACT takes place in stationary phase [20].", "CDA and RED are thought to create damage to the membrane leading to H+ gradient breakage and thus energy spilling, provoking cell death and lysis of a fraction of the population [21,22]. The cellular content of the lysed cells, released in the extracellular medium, is used to feed, and especially provide phosphate to, the surviving population. This phenomenon of programmed cell death (PCD) is well documented in Streptomyces [23,24], and the lysis of vegetative mycelium has long been considered as a prerequisite for the emergence of aerial mycelium [25]. Indeed, the possible role of CDA in PCD in SC has already been evoked [18], and that of RED was recently demonstrated [26]. Antibiotics fulfilling similar functions as CDA and RED are classified as Type I antibiotics. The supply of phosphate in conditions of low P availability is usually fulfilled by the induction of the expression of genes of the Pho regulon that are under the positive control of the two-component system PhoR/PhoP [8,9]. However, some of our recent work (Aaron-Millan Oropeza et al., submitted) demonstrated that the expression of PhoR/PhoP is much lower in S. coelicolor than in the phylogenetically closely related strain to S. lividans that does not produce antibiotics. This resulted in a high nitrogen but low phosphate availability in S. coelicolor compared to S. lividans. Consequently, in order to fulfill its phosphate needs, S. coelicolor adopts an alternative strategy that is the triggering of the biosynthesis of type I antibiotics. The phosphate resulting from cell lysis allows the restoration of the energy balance of the cell via the activation of its oxidative metabolism [6]. The activation of the oxidative metabolism requires the enhanced expression and stimulation of the activity of the enzymes of the Krebs cycle generating energy (GTP) or reduced cofactors (NADH, FADH2) whose re-oxidation by the respiratory chain generates ATP (Aaron-Millan Oropeza et al., submitted). The necessary fuelling of the Krebs cycle by acetylCoA, in S. coelicolor, is correlated with a reduced synthesis of storage lipids of the TriAcylGlycerol (TAG) family that also requires acetylCoA for its synthesis [6].", "However, when Pi becomes too scarce to support the ATP generating function of the respiratory chain, a blockage of the latter occurs, resulting in electron leakage toward secondary acceptors and thus generation of oxidative stress (ROS/RNS). Many reports in the literature suggest that oxidative stress might be an important trigger of the biosynthesis of some antibiotics in Streptomyces as in fungi [27,28,29,30], called \u201cType II\u201d antibiotics. Some of these antibiotics, including ACT, contain quinone groups that are able to capture electrons [31]. They have thus antioxidant properties, and their biosynthesis could be considered as an adaptive response to oxidative stress (for example, chromomycin [32]). Furthermore, and most importantly, these molecules also have the ability to reduce the electron flow in the respiratory chain, leading to lower efficiency of the latter and thus to a reduction of ATP generation. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that the onset of ACT biosynthesis coincides with an abrupt drop in the intracellular ATP concentration in S. coelicolor [6] and that the deletion of the ACT cluster is correlated with an enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress (Aaron-Millan Oropeza et al., submitted). Other type II antibiotics achieve a similar reduction of ATP generation by targeting different components of the respiratory chain [33,34,35]. For instance, oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase activity via the blockage of H+ entry [36,37] whereas antimycin inhibits the cytochrome c reductase of the electron transport chain [38]. The function of \u201ctype II\u201d antibiotics is to reduce the efficiency of respiration in order to adjust ATP synthesis to low Pi availability.", "At last, if ATP cannot be generated because of extreme Pi scarcity, it has to be saved to maintain an energy balance compatible with the survival of bacteria. In that case of severe energy stress, the biosynthesis of another type of antibiotics called \u201cType III\u201d is triggered. Type III antibiotics are known to specifically inhibit ATP consuming anabolic processes, such as the biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, proteins, membrane lipids, and cell walls. They can thus contribute to energy saving. The signal triggering the biosynthesis of type III antibiotics might be a high concentration of NMP, which signals a severe energy deficit, as in eukaryotic microorganisms [39]. \u201cType III\u201d antibiotics are the most well known antibiotics that are widely used in medicine. They are less toxic than type I or II antibiotics, which target membranes or respiration, since they target specific bacterial/fungal machineries (https://www.orthobullets.com/basic-science/9059/antibiotic-classification-and-mechanism)."]
