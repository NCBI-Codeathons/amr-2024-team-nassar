["4. Discussion", "As a crucial cooperative partner of the grapevine, endophytes strongly influence the growth of the host plant, even the physiological metabolism [3]. During the long\u2013term interaction, endophytes and their host grapevine establish a mutualistic symbiotic relationship. The genetics and metabolism of the endophytes would modify the metabolic pathway of their host plants and vice versa [25,26]. Most of the studies have tried to explore the reciprocal mechanism of the complex interaction between grapevine and endophytes, but there is still a great gap in knowledge about the exact mechanisms of the interaction. Today, multi\u2013omics technology can provide insight into the interactions between host plants and endophytes. In our study, the different responses of tissue\u2013cultured seedlings of the cultivar \u2018Rose Honey\u2019 inoculated with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 at three different time points were analysed at the transcriptomic level, compared to our previous study carried out on the cultivar \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019. This work has attempted to illustrate the differential response between grapevine cultivars and the interactions between endophytes and their host grapevine, as well as give insights for grape quality management in viticulture through the use of fungal endophytes.", "4.1. Endophytic\u2013Induced Resistance in Grapevines, Similar to Pathogen Invasion", "Endophytic fungi undergo a series of complex processes as mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi, including spore and affinity host recognition, activation, adhesion to surface substrates, germination, and invasion into the interior of the tissue, as well as penetration of the host plant\u2019s mechanical barrier and overcoming its defence response [27]. However, similar to mycorrhizal fungi, symbiotic fungi have been reported to induce a weaker plant defence response than pathogenic fungi, presumably due to endophytic fungi with lower virulence factors, the mycelial secretion of certain glycoproteins, or a change in cell wall composition that weakens the host\u2019s ability to strongly recognise them [7,28].", "It has been reported that fungi infect the host grapevine as follows: the fungus/spore adheres to the surface of the tissue, then produces the infection structures for attaching stably to the host, invades the host tissue, and successfully colonizes and spreads within the host [29,30]. During infection, fungi release various metabolites that are detrimental to the plant host, i.e., known as virulence factors, including related enzymes and toxins. In turn, the grapevine responds to the fungi by activating defence responses and downstream resistance signalling against invasion and colonization, such as the stimulation of defence\u2013related enzymes, phytohormones, and pathogen-related proteins [31].", "The pathogen\u2013associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)\u2013triggered immunity (PTI) and effector (virulence protein)\u2013triggered immunity (ETI) were the primary defence responses [32]. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognise PAMPs and induce mitogen\u2013activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and calcium signalling; subsequently, MAPKs and calcium signalling activate defence responses to suppress pathogen colonization [33,34]. However, endophytes have evolved numerous virulence effectors to avoid PTI and achieve infection. In turn, the host plants have also evolved genes that can recognise specifical effectors and trigger a second host immune response, termed ETI, to restrict pathogen growth [35].", "Cytoplasmic Ca2+ rapidly accumulates when plants perceive PAMPs, calcium\u2013dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), RBOH, calmodulin (CaM), and CML produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) separately to activate plant defence responses [36]. In our study, we identified several genes, including cyclic nucleotide\u2013gated channels (CNGCs), CDPK, RBOH, CaM, and CML, which were upregulated to some extent after Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 infection. Additionally, once plants recognise PAMPs, MAPK cascades are activated followed by WRKY transcription factors that induce the expression of defence\u2013related genes [32,37]. Here, we observed that the MAPK signalling pathway was upregulated in grapevine seedlings after inoculation with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2, and we identified flagellin\u2013sensing 2 (FLS2), mitogen\u2013activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), WRKY transcription factor 22 (WRKY22/29), and WRKY transcription factor 33 (WRKY 25/33). While in the ETI pathway, PRM1\u2013interacting protein 4 (RIN4), R genes (RPM1 and RPS2), disease resistance protein (PBS1), enhanced disease susceptibility protein (EDS1), and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) had variable expression levels, most of which were upregulated or downregulated over time, suggesting that genes would be reprogrammed when Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 invade host grapevine.", "4.2. Fungal Endophytes Inoculation Induced the Expression of Genes Involved in Phytohormones and Secondary Metabolites in Tissue-Cultured Grapevine Seedlings", "The major phytohormones, such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), indole\u20133\u2013acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), and ethylene (ET), play an important role in plant growth, plant immune response via transduction of cellular signals, and the induction of defence\u2013related gene expression [30]. The transcriptome combined with the metabolome and hormone metabolism revealed that grape berries (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Carignan) had an activated defence response involving salicylic acid and jasmonates, along with the accumulation of defence\u2013related genes and metabolites, such as phenylpropanoids and fatty acids [38]. During infection with the pathogen Lasiodiplodia theobromae, the homologous DEGs in the auxin transduction pathway were all significantly upregulated, and DEGs in the cytokinin, JA, SA, and ET transduction pathways were also mainly upregulated [13]. After inoculation with the pathogen Plasmopara viticola, the defence responses in V. vinifera cv. Mgaloblishvili were mainly mediated by ET [39]. In our study, these phytohormones were fine\u2013tuned due to Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 infection, especially auxin, JA, and SA (Figure 6; Table S3). Auxin signalling is critical for plant resistance to the necrotrophic fungi Plectosphaerella cucumerina and Botrytis cinerea [40]. And 59 upregulated and 63 downregulated DEGs were induced in the plant hormone signalling pathway in our study. The homologous genes Aux/IAA and TIR1 were mostly downregulated in response to Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2, while the homologous genes SAUR and GH3 were mostly upregulated. In addition, the JA\u2013 and SA\u2013mediated defence response is critical in the fight against pathogens. The genes PR-1, JAZ, and TGA, which are involved in JA or SA biosynthesis and signalling, were significantly upregulated in grapevine seedlings, in agreement with previous studies carried out with the fungal pathogens Lasiodiplodia theobromae on grapevine and Schizaphis graminum on wheat [41,42]. However, in our study, some genes also involved in cytokinin, IAA, ABA, gibberellin, and brasinosteoid signalling, such as CRE1, AHP, PP2C, SnRK2, DELLA, GID2, BKI1, and CYCD3, were transcriptionally affected by Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2, being mostly upregulated in the early phase of the infection and downregulated at later stages.", "Secondary metabolites can act as physical and chemical barriers to pathogen infection and induce defence\u2013related gene expression in plants to inhibit fungal growth and rot development [43,44]. Similarly, pathogenic fungal invasion leads to the upregulation of genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism related to the defence response in grapes. The susceptible Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera and the tolerant Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris inoculated with Neofusicoccum parvum displayed great changes in both primary and specialized metabolites, especially stilbene and flavonoid compounds [45]. In our study, some of the secondary metabolic pathways were upregulated in infected grapevines seedlings, such as flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis, etc. These pathways may be involved in the fungal resistance mechanism of grapevine (Figure 7). Similarly, phenylalanine, phenylpropanoid, and stilbenoid biosynthesis were enriched with several upregulated genes in grape berries from Vitis vinifera cv. Trincadeira with Botrytis cinerea infection [46]. Furthermore, the STS and ROMT genes were also expressed at higher levels in grapes infected with Aspergillus niger [47].", "In addition, transcriptomic analysis revealed that several pathways related to plant growth and development were depressed in grapevine seedlings challenged with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2, such as photosynthesis, photosynthesis\u2013antenna proteins, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, pentose phosphate pathway, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, N\u2013glycan biosynthesis, ribosome, spliceosome, etc. (Table 1). The results showed that inoculation with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 led to a reduction in photosynthetic activity and subsequently inhibited the growth of grapevine seedlings. As proposed by the optimal defence theory, secondary metabolites are produced when plants experience environmental stress, which act as a defence but reduce plant growth until the plant and its symbiotic fungi reach an equilibrium [48].", "4.3. Differences in Responses between Endophyte Strains and Grapevine Cultivars", "Together with these transcriptome data and our previous study [17], it was shown that tissue\u2013cultured seedlings rapidly initiated a large number of DEGs due to infection with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 in either the \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019 or \u2018Rose Honey\u2019 cultivars.", "Regarding the grape cultivars, the response trends were similar. For both the grape cultivars \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019 and \u2018Rose Honey\u2019, the endophyte Alt XHYN2 inoculation triggered a stronger response than the endophyte Epi R2-21, most likely due to the fact that the endophyte Alt XHYN2 belongs to the fungal pathogen Alternaria and lives in a mutualistic relationship or as a pathogen causing disease in the host plant [49]. With the exception of the samples of endophyte Alt XHYN2 after 15 d of inoculation on the cultivar \u2018Rose Honey\u2019, DEGs were more abundant on the cultivar \u2018Rose Honey\u2019 than on the cultivar \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019, especially in terms of the downregulated DEGs, suggesting that tissue\u2013cultured seedlings of the cultivar \u2018Rose Honey\u2019 induced stronger defence responses to endophyte infection, which is most likely due to the fact that the cultivar \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019 is a worldwide planted wine grape variety with strong vitality and good adaptability.", "Although the transcriptional responses of the two grape cultivar (\u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019 and \u2018Rose Honey\u2019) were very similar, some differences could be observed. In \u2018Rose Honey\u2019, all DEGs (up\u2013 and downregulated) increased over time during Epi R2-21 infection, whereas in \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019, only the upregulated DEGs followed this trend. An opposite situation occurred with Alt XHYN2, as all DEGs (up\u2013 and downregulated) increased over time in \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019, but not in \u2018Rose Honey\u2019. Here, the downregulated DEGs increased over time, while the total DEGs and the upregulated DEGs increased from 6 h to 6 d, but then tended to decrease from 6 d to 15 d.", "In addition, according to the PPI network, the genes VIT_16s0100g00910 encoding CHS involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis, and VIT_11s0065g00350 encoding CYP73A commonly involved in phenylalanine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis pathways, were suggested to play a crucial role in endophyte defense and metabolite production in both the \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019 and \u2018Rose Honey\u2019 cultivars."]
