["DISCUSSION", "The pipeline was designed to identify secondary metabolite gene clusters (clusters) containing potential resistance genes. It is a delicate balance of filtering away as many clusters as possible to narrow down the field to the best candidates while keeping as many clusters with potential resistance genes as possible.", "We have chosen an approach where we make no assumptions about the function or makeup of resistance genes besides being homologs of a gene shared by most organisms in the data set (a mock measure for essentiality). Another approach could be to screen for specific classes of essential genes or resistance targets within predicted clusters. This approach was used in another study where 86 bacterial Salinispora genomes were mined for duplicated genes involved in central metabolism colocalizing with clusters. Clusters containing putative fatty acid synthase resistance genes were identified, and these were shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of thiotetronic acid natural products, including thiolactomycin, which is a well-known fatty acid synthase inhibitor (24). This approach builds on knowledge of housekeeping genes, thus requiring extensive knowledge of the primary metabolism. In filamentous fungi, there are still many uncharacterized genes; therefore, there is a risk of missing interesting resistance genes using that approach. To avoid this, we chose to use a wider approach based only on the homology copy number pattern of predicted secondary metabolism genes and not on the functions. The underlying assumption is that our pipeline identifies conserved household genes with a homolog in a cluster. Using our approach, we avoid limiting the search space to only known mechanisms, thereby making it possible to find new essential mechanisms and drug targets. Our non-function-impelled approach can be used on organisms with both little and extensive available knowledge. Finally, the setup makes it possible to search the identified clusters afterwards with a criterion such as the presence of primary metabolism genes. The pipeline has been designed for a specific data setup, but it is equally possible to apply the approach to other data sets.", "In applying the pipeline, it is important to select the input data carefully. Genomes from very distantly related species might not give meaningful homologous protein families using our cutoffs, since proteins with similar functions might be more different than our cutoffs allow. Step 1 in the pipeline combines the input data and creates a table of homology counts for all cluster genes in the input set. In this step, no filtering or selection is done, and hence, there are no parameters to tweak.", "In step 2, strict or alternative patterns for the cluster homology counts can be selected. Using the strict selection criteria, only 8% of the clusters meet the criteria. When using selection patterns that are too restrictive, there is a risk of creating false-negative results, thus filtering away good cases. As mentioned above, many common secondary metabolite genes are likely to have homologs and belong to large protein families. Of the cluster genes belonging to this test data set, 12% and 6% belong to protein families larger than 102 and 153 proteins, respectively, and notably, these are found in 51% and 37% of the total clusters. Thus, using the strict selection pattern, up to one-half of the clusters are likely to be discarded due to the homology count pattern of standard cluster genes, which is highly conservative and can cause false-negative results. We therefore recommend the use of the alternative selection pattern. If the species in the data set are distantly related, the size of the protein families might be smaller, and therefore, a lower Xinput is recommended. The lowest value of Xinput that we recommend is 1.5; when using a lower value, the risk of disregarding true resistance gene families becomes very high.", "Step 3, filtering for more than one cluster having the putative resistance gene, was designed to avoid false-positive results due to cluster prediction errors. This step is useful for data that include closely related species likely to have similar clusters. If the data consist mainly of distantly related species, it is less likely that similar clusters will be found in more species, and hence, the risk of filtering away good cases increases, thereby making false-negative results. In the test data, about two-thirds of the cases are filtered away in this step. If running the pipeline and more than two-thirds are filtered away, we suggest skipping this step. With distantly related species, we suggest always skipping this step.", "Step 4 was made to avoid false-positive results, by checking that the resistance gene is a homolog of an essential gene. One can set the percentage of species required to have the homolog. If the species are distantly related, it is more likely that some species have a different essential household mechanism and hence do not have a copy of the household/target gene. A lower percentage of organisms that should have a homolog is thus recommended in this case. Another reason for choosing a lower percentage is when the quality of the genome sequence data is low, with incomplete genomes, or when the data include novel species distantly related to model organisms, where the gene prediction algorithms might not work as efficiently. In these cases, absent homologs could be false-negative results and should thus be allowed for.", "Step 5 was also added to avoid false-positive results; in this step, at least 50% of the species should have only a single homolog. This filtering step is independent of the quality of the data and the relatedness of the species, and we therefore recommend using this at all times. Here, 30 to 60% of the cases are left after this filtering.", "In the future, it could be interesting to investigate the transcription of target and resistance genes in order to investigate if there are differences in expression patterns and if these can be applied in the search.", "Conclusions.", "In this study, we have created a method to identify clusters responsible for producing bioactive compounds. The approach that we have developed is based on a specific resistance mechanism and paves the way for rational selection of promising bioactive clusters from whole-genome data. The FRIGG pipeline was designed for relatively closely related fungal genomes; however, several filtering steps and parameters can be tweaked to fit different kinds of data and to deal with the most likely errors from predictions and draft genomes.", "We have tested the developed pipeline on 51 Aspergillus and Penicillium genomes, using various settings. By applying these settings, we identified 72 unique putative resistance genes and clusters in total. In addition, the previously characterized fellutamide B resistance gene inpE was successfully identified with this pipeline, confirming the accuracy and applicability of the pipeline to such cases of resistance mechanisms.", "As more and more genomes are sequenced, the relevance of this approach will increase, and it will become a useful method for selecting which clusters to focus on in the hunt for novel drugs such as antifungals, anticancer drugs, and antimicrobial compounds."]
