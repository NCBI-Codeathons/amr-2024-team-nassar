["Discussion", "The\nBLM N-acetyltransferase (BlmB) is a resistance\nelement found within the blm gene cluster of S. verticillus ATCC15003 that bestows self-resistance to\nBLM by acetylating the primary amine of its \u03b2-aminoalanine moiety,\nthe axial ligand of the BLM-metal ion-binding domain. As there are\nmany examples of bacterial self-resistance elements conferring resistance\nto a family of antimicrobial agents,19,38,39 it was surprising to discover BlmB was capable of\nacetylating only BLM and not other members of the BLM family of antitumor\nantibiotics, particularly PLM, a compound identical to BLM except\nfor the presence of a thiazolinyl-thiazole moiety instead of the bithiazole\nmoiety found in BLM.21 A crystal structure\nof BlmB implied that a canyonlike groove of three aromatic side chains\nis too narrow to accommodate the nonplanar thiazoline ring of PLM.22 Interestingly, the zbm gene\ncluster from S. flavoviridis ATCC21892 does not contain\na blmB/tlmB homologue,31 suggesting ZBM, a thiazolinyl-thiazole-containing\nanalogue of BLM, would not be acetylated by a BlmB-like enzyme. In\nthis study, we determined whether BlmB and TlmB can acetylate BLM\nB2, TLM A, PLM D1, and ZBM, four members of the BLM family, in vitro and investigated the resistance mechanisms of the\nZBM producer S. flavoviridisin vivo.", "Both BlmB and TlmB acetylate BLM B2, TLM A, PLM D1, and ZBM,\nbut\nonly the metal-free forms, in vitro. Although metal-free\nBLM as a requirement for BlmB activity was previously stated,22 it appeared to be anecdotal as we found no experimental\nevidence in the literature. Comparisons of the BLM structures (Figure 4A),12,22,40 free and enzyme-bound, reveal a probable cause for the lack of acetylation\nof the metal-bound forms of BLMs by BlmB and TlmB. When metal is coordinated\nto the five nitrogens of BLM, as in the case of the Cu(II)-BLM complex\nbound to BlmA or the Co(II)-BLM complex alone, the metal-binding domain\nforms a compact conformation. Conversely, BLM in BlmB must adopt an\nopen conformation allowing the primary amine of BLM access to acetyl-CoA.\nThe tight conformation of BLM when bound to metal likely precludes\nthe correct binding orientation in BlmB necessary for catalysis and\nprevents BlmB from pulling apart the tightly chelated nitrogen atoms\n(Figure 4A).", "Figure 4(A) Conformations of free and enzyme-bound\nBLM reveal its structural\nflexibility: (I) free Co(II)-BLM A2 (Protein Data Bank entry 1DEY), (II) Cu(II)-BLM\nA2 bound to BlmA (Protein Data Bank entry 1JIF), and (III) BLM A2 bound to BlmB (Protein\nData Bank entry 2ZW7).

Resistance\nin the native producer is primarily achieved through sesquestration\nby BlmA (thick blue box), while antibiotic modification by BlmB (thin\ngreen box) provides an additional mechanism of resistance. BlmB acetylates\nthe axial ligand of the BLM metal-binding domain, but only in the\npresence of metal-free BLM. Acetylated BLM (Ac-BLM) can bind metal,\nbut O2 binding or activation is inhibited. BlmA tightly\nbinds metal-bound BLM, preventing O2 binding and activation.\nFor the sake of simplicity, the coordinated metal ion is represented\nas an M. Members of the BLM family are isolated as Cu(II) complexes;\nstructures have been determined as Cu or Co complexes, and Fe(II)\nmust bind before activated BLM is generated.", "(A) Conformations of free and enzyme-bound\nBLM reveal its structural\nflexibility: (I) free Co(II)-BLM A2 (Protein Data Bank entry 1DEY), (II) Cu(II)-BLM\nA2 bound to BlmA (Protein Data Bank entry 1JIF), and (III) BLM A2 bound to BlmB (Protein\nData Bank entry 2ZW7).

Comparable Michaelis constants indicate each member, regardless\nof its differences in structure, binds favorably for the reaction\nto occur. Thus, the narrow bithiazole binding groove in BlmB does\nnot prevent the correct binding orientation necessary for acetylation\nto occur in thiazolinyl-thiazole analogues. A sequence alignment of\nBlmB and TlmB reveals only two of the three aromatic side chains in\nthe canyonlike groove are conserved (Figure S9 of the Supporting Information). One could imagine a\nPhe/Val substitution, as in the case of BlmB and TlmB, may provide\nthe necessary space to better accommodate a nonplanar thiazoline ring.\nHowever, neither BlmB nor TlmB shows a preference for bithiazole as\nin BLM B2 and TLM A or thiazolinyl-thiazole as in PLM D1 and ZBM,\nsuggesting the canyonlike groove plays little role in substrate recognition\nand specificity.", "The BLM-binding proteins have long been known\nfor their sequestration,\nand therefore inactivation, of members of the BLM family of antitumor\nantibiotics.12,20,41,42 The structure of BlmA, the BLM-binding protein\nfrom S. verticillus ATCC15003, was determined with\nbound BLM B2 in both the metal-free and Cu(II)-complexed forms,12 suggesting BlmA can bind either form of BLM\nand thus confer resistance in either situation. Given the significant\nstructural similarity of both BlmA and BLM B2 in both the metal-free\nand Cu(II)-complexed forms and the fact that BLMs are isolated as\nCu(II) complexes,15,16,30 BlmA likely preferentially binds metal-bound BLMs in vivo (Figure 4B). As experimentally determined\nin this study, BlmB acetylates only the metal-free form of BLMs. As\nmembers of the metal-free forms of the BLM family are incapable of\ncausing DNA damage,3,43 BlmB and TlmB appear to inactivate\nan unharmful form of an antibiotic. Although counterintuitive, covalent\nmodification of an inactive antibiotic by BlmB or TlmB immediately\nafter its biosynthesis may provide a preemptive and complementary\nmechanism of resistance from self-imposed oxidative damage (Figure 4B) and/or a more stable, yet potentially reversible,\ninactivation. It is not clear, however, when and at what level the blmB/tlmB gene is expressed during biosynthesis. We suspect\nBlmB or TlmB acts on only the final biosynthetic product, a model\nthat is consistent with our in vitro data, previously\nreported studies,21 and the numerous contacts\nBlmB makes with the four functional domains of BLM.22 This hypothesis would rule out BlmB acetylating a biosynthetic\nintermediate or precursor.", "We previously reported that the cloned zbm cluster\nfrom S. flavoviridis ATCC21892 lacks the blmB/tlmB homologue, implying BlmA or TlmA performs the\nessential role in BLM resistance.31 We\nnow establish that S. flavoviridis does not possess\na blmB/tlmB homologue in its genome. S. flavoviridis therefore appears to forego the BlmB resistance\nmechanism of antibiotic modification, and ZbmA alone must be sufficient\nto provide ZBM resistance. With these findings and the fact that Cu(II)-BLM\ncomplexes are isolated, we now propose that the mechanism of sequestration\nby BlmA, TlmA, and ZbmA is the primary mechanism of resistance. BlmB\nand TlmB may then be considered as a secondary mechanism of resistance.\nIndeed, we show that BlmB can confer resistance to ZBM in\nvivo in the ZBM-sensitive S. flavoviridis SB9031 strain and that introduction of BlmB into wild-type S. flavoviridis SB9001 further increases ZBM resistance\nas exemplified by the SB9033 strain. The reacquisition of ZBM resistance\nin sensitive strain S. flavoviridis SB9031 by expression\nof blmB confirms that ZBM can be inactivated by a\nBlmB homologue in vivo and proves BlmB can confer\nresistance as the sole resistance element.", "This study highlights\nthe biochemical functionality and antibiotic\nresistance mechanism of the BLM family of antitumor antibiotics by\nthe BLM N-acetyltransferases. Comparison among the blm, tlm, and zbm gene\nclusters exposes the evolutionary relationship between the BlmB and\nTlmB N-acetyltransferases and the BlmA-, TlmA-, and\nZbmA-binding proteins as mechanisms of resistance to the BLM family\nof drugs. On the basis of this study, we now propose a unified model\nfor self-resistance within the producers of BLM, TLM, and ZBM, with\nBlmA, TlmA, and ZbmA providing the primary mechanism of resistance\nand BlmB and TlmB as a secondary additional mechanism of resistance."]
