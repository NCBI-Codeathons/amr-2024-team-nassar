["Discussion", "Our investigation of species-specific bacterial adherence to CEACAM1 revealed an unforeseen example of extreme genetic divergence within the great apes. The bonobo CEACAM1 gene could represent a rapid succession of single residue changes combined with multiple recombination events arising in bonobos under strong selection and/or a population bottleneck. Alternatively, this allele may be ancient and have been subject to balancing selection or incomplete lineage sorting in ancestral hominid populations. We also considered that the source of the bonobo CEACAM1 sequence may not be from functional CEACAM genes, but a pseudogenized CEACAM sequence or a pregnancy-specific glycoprotein, a family of proteins closely related to CEACAMs. However, a BLAST search of relevant NCBI databases (see Materials and methods) fails to identify any new genomic regions in bonobos or other primates with greater sequence identity than what had already been found. While there are multiple possible explanations for the highly divergent nature of bonobo CEACAM1, absent further evidence the origin of this particular allele remains obscure. What is clear from the example of bonobo CEACAM1, however, is the extent to which gene conversion can rapidly generate diversity between closely related species and the impact of such variation on interactions with microbes.", "During the course of investigating the origin of the bonobo CEACAM1 sequence, we discovered evidence that gene conversion has shaped the evolution of many CEACAMs across primates, primarily impacting homologous proteins targeted by bacteria. While we identify several instances of likely gene conversion, results from phylogenetic analyses probably represent an underestimate of the true number of recombination events that have occurred among rapidly evolving CEACAMs in primates. Repeated episodes of gene conversion can obscure past instances of recombination and hinder their identification by gene-species tree discordance. GARD analyses and recombination detection programs in general also tend to miss many recombination events (Bay and Bielawski, 2011; Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006). One particularly interesting example in orangutans implicates multiple conversion events impacting CEACAM1, CEACAM5, and CEACAM8 (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1). Phylogenetic analyses indicate a species-specific conversion event between CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 in orangutans. Prior to the CEACAM1-CEACAM5 conversion, however, residues 29\u201364 in either CEACAM1 or CEACAM5 were likely replaced by the homologous sequence from CEACAM8. Evidence for this event includes not only multiple nonsynonymous substitutions shared with orangutan CEACAM8, but a shared synonymous substitution in both orangutan CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 only observed in hominid CEACAM8 homologs. Despite this evidence, neither our phylogenetic analyses nor GARD analyses suggest CEACAM8 has been involved in gene conversion. Like CEACAM7, the involvement of CEACAM8 in intra-paralog gene conversion is consistent with CEACAMs with rapid N-domain evolution participating in gene conversion events. Overall, the rapid shuffling of genetic variation among CEACAM genes that we observe could greatly augment the potential for host adaptation in the face of microbial antagonism.", "It has been suggested that gene conversion between CEACAM paralogs preserves the ability of CEACAM3 to effectively mimic bacterially antagonized CEACAMs and thereby maintain its function as a decoy receptor (Zid and Drouin, 2013; Zimmermann, 2019). Indeed, our results and those of Adrian et al., 2019, support the importance of maintaining the similarity of CEACAM3 to other adhesin-binding CEACAMs in apes and Old World monkeys. However, our findings suggest that gene conversion does not only serve to maintain CEACAM3\u2019s mimicry function. There is no evidence that New World monkeys encode a CEACAM3 homolog, yet within this group gene conversion appears to be rampant between CEACAM1, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 (Figure 4C). Additionally, we observe multiple conversion events in hominids that do not involve CEACAM3 (Figure 4C, Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1, and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4). Though we cannot rule out the possibility that New World monkey CEACAM1, CEACAM5, or CEACAM6 may have evolved a mimicry function similar to CEACAM3, our observations in hominids suggest additional drivers for pervasive gene conversion within the CCM1356 group.", "High sequence similarity and close chromosomal proximity, such as that seen for the N-domains of the CCM1356 group (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3), could result in periodic interconversion of paralogous sequences, which in many cases may be functionally neutral (Bittihn and Tsimring, 2017; Zid and Drouin, 2013). However, we show that the common CEACAM1 variant, Q89H, which matches CEACAM5 at this position, abolishes binding to at least two Opa proteins (Figure 6C). Human CEACAM1 variant A49V, which reduces binding to Opa74, also matches the equivalent residue in CEACAM5 as well as CEACAM3. These examples illustrate the potential benefit of gene conversion between epithelial CEACAM paralogs beyond CEACAM3 mimicry. Given that gene conversion within this family appears to be enriched specifically among CEACAMs recognized by bacteria, we propose that gene conversion among epithelial CEACAMs reflects a general mechanism of pathogen evasion (Figure 7). Such a mechanism allows beneficial sets of mutations to spread, whether between decoys and targets or among antagonized epithelial CEACAMs, more rapidly than conversion of residues through independent mutational events (Bittihn and Tsimring, 2017). In addition, recombination provides decoys the ability to gain binding to CEACAM antagonists through exchanges from epithelial CEACAMs as observed for CEACAM3 (Adrian et al., 2019). Finally, the interchangeability of CEACAM domains could further accelerate the exchange and spread of beneficial mutations in host genomes (Bittihn and Tsimring, 2017). In these ways gene conversion provides an important mechanism by which the host can keep pace with rapidly evolving pathogenic microbes.", "Figure 7.Model of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) evolution in primates.(A) Bacterial adhesins recognize a subset of epithelial CEACAM proteins and avoid binding with decoy CEACAM receptors present on neutrophils. (B) Gene conversion facilitates the shuffling of regions of the CEACAM N-domain that alter binding to bacterial adhesins.

(C) Through gene conversion outlined in B, epithelial CEACAM proteins avoid binding by bacterial adhesins while the CEACAM decoy receptor gains binding, triggering bacterial clearance through phagocytosis.", "Our study examined the influence of CEACAM1 diversity on bacterial binding using adhesins from H. pylori and N. gonorrhoeae as models. However, a diverse range of pathogenic and commensal microbes are known to bind host CEACAMs, and it is unlikely that natural selection across primates has been driven by any single pathogen. What is clear from these results is the major influence that CEACAM divergence and polymorphisms can have on recognition by structurally unrelated bacterial adhesins, and moreover the impact that such diversity could have on shaping future disease outbreaks. It is also notable that recombination between paralogs contributes to the immense diversity of Opa genes Neisseria (Sadarangani et al., 2011). In this regard CEACAM-Opa interactions could reflect a general mechanism by which gene conversion between paralogs contributes to reciprocal adaptation in both hosts and microbes.", "In addition to exploring the role of CEACAM gene conversion among primates, we provide evidence that this process continues to shape CEACAM diversity within human populations. The three human CEACAM1 variants we test in our adhesin-binding assay are part of a group of related CEACAM1 haplotypes that increase sequence similarity to CEACAM3 and/or CEACAM5 (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1). Extended haplotypes that increase similarly to CEACAM1 at both synonymous and nonsynonymous positions in the N-domain are also found for CEACAM3 and CEACAM5 in humans (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4). Indeed, haplotypes consisting of variants of putative recombination events are the most common non-reference alleles for CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM5 (Figure 6, Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134). Variant sites in these proteins tend to lie along the protein-binding interface of the N-domain and often impact residues known to influence adhesin recognition. The relationships between these different CEACAM haplotypes appears to be complex, as many different combinations of partial variant haplotypes exist for each CEACAM paralog. The haplotype structures we observe suggest these CEACAM variants are the result of one or more conversion events between paralogous sequences, likely followed by further recombination with the major CEACAM allele.", "Important questions remain regarding the rapid evolution of a subset of primate CEACAM proteins. Among these questions is why CEACAM7 and CEACAM8 show similar patterns of evolution to bacterially antagonized CEACAMs despite no known instances of bacterial antagonism. The simplest explanation is that CEACAM7 and CEACAM8 are themselves the targets of as yet unidentified pathogen antagonists (Sintsova et al., 2015). Alternatively, their rapid evolution may reflect pressure to maintain binding with rapidly evolving bacterially antagonized CEACAMs (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006; Skubitz and Skubitz, 2008) could merely be a result of their genomic proximity to rapidly evolving CEACAMs prone to gene conversion (Zid and Drouin, 2013) or could be the result of some as yet unknown evolutionary pressures. Another intriguing aspect of rapid CEACAM evolution is the impact rapid divergence might have beyond interactions with pathogenic microbes. Given the extensive overlap of CEACAM-binding sites among unrelated bacterial adhesins, the ramifications of rapid CEACAM evolution likely extend beyond the adhesins of pathogens to those of commensal and beneficial microbes as well. For commensal microbes that rely on these interaction surfaces, CEACAM evolution could significantly alter their ability to colonize the host. The impact of CEACAM divergence on composition of the host microbiome and/or the evolution of commensal strains warrants further investigation.", "Studies of other \u2018housekeeping\u2019 proteins targeted by pathogens have found that sites under positive selection typically do not overlap with sites involved in essential host functions (Barber and Elde, 2014; Demogines et al., 2013). This is clearly not the case for CEACAMs, where we observed extensive overlap between sites involved in host protein interactions, sites targeted by bacterial adhesins, and sites undergoing rapid evolution (Figure 2B). How CEACAMs are able to rapidly evolve while maintaining their other essential host protein interactions remains a mystery. Future studies on CEACAM protein functions, interaction networks, and pathogen antagonism will likely clarify these outstanding questions regarding rapidly evolving CEACAMs.", "Collectively our study provides evidence that repeated adaptation among primate CEACAMs has shaped host-specific cell adherence by diverse pathogenic bacteria. We find that over half of the CEACAM paralogs found in humans display signatures of positive selection across the primate lineage, localized primarily to the extracellular N-domain. We further discovered that rapid evolution of CEACAM N-domains has been facilitated by extensive \u2018shuffling\u2019 of sequences between a subset of CEACAM paralogs likely through repeated gene conversion. The diversification of primate CEACAM N-domain sequences has likely had significant consequences for interactions between primates and bacteria. Consistent with observations across other primate species, we also provide evidence that gene conversion events may impact bacterial pathogen recognition of CEACAMs in contemporary human populations. Together this work reveals how dynamic evolutionary processes have shaped bacterial-host cell associations with consequences for infectious disease susceptibility."]
