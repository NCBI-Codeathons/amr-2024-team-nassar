["Discussion", "The present study is the first to document the impact of IFN-\u03b3 on constitutive- and immunoproteasome homeostasis in three bortezomib-resistant tumor cell lines of different hematologic origin and to assess the implications for anti-proliferative activity of proteasome inhibitors. Characteristically, the bortezomib-resistant cell lines largely expressed the mutated form of PSMB5, and clearly, IFN-\u03b3 increased the expression of catalytically active immunoproteasome levels in bortezomib-resistant cells with concurrent downregulation of both mutated and unmutated alleles of constitutive \u03b25. This property facilitated sensitization to bortezomib, and an even more pronounced sensitization to the immunoproteasome inhibitor ONX 0914. Sensitization effects were most prominent in 8226/BTZ cells and lowest in CEM/BTZ cells, which may be related to the fact that CCRF-CEM leukemia cells have low levels of IFN-\u03b3 receptors [30]. At equal doses of IFN-\u03b3, induction of immunoproteasome \u03b25i and \u03b21i subunit mRNA and protein expression was significantly higher (up to 4-fold) in bortezomib-resistant tumor cells compared to parental cells. Concomitantly, constitutive proteasome subunits were clearly downregulated at a protein level, but not as much on mRNA levels. This phenomenon was also reported by others (reviewed by Ebstein et al [31]), indicating that downregulation of constitutive subunits involves a post-transcriptional mechanism. Nonetheless, by employing a very sensitive lightcycler RT-PCR technique, a moderate downregulation on mRNA level was detectable. Additionally, in PBMCs from healthy individuals, the same results were noticed as in the parental cell lines when exposed to IFN-\u03b3, and call for further analyses in bortezomib-resistant patient specimen. It is not clear whether the upregulation of immunoproteasome levels reflects a compensatory and homeostatic effect after initial downregulation during bortezomib resistance development. Importantly, increased \u03b25i expression can drive incorporation of immunoproteasome subunits into prototypic immunoproteasomes [32] or facilitate assembly in hybrid types of proteasomes (\u03b21\u2009+\u2009\u03b22\u2009+\u2009\u03b25i and \u03b21i\u2009+\u2009\u03b22\u2009+\u2009\u03b25i) [33]. Conceivably, these hybrid forms could compensate for impaired catalytic activity of constitutive proteasomes assembled with a mutated \u03b25-subunit. Following use of \u03b25-selective substrates, chymotrypsin-like catalytic activity in cell extracts of bortezomib-resistant cells increased 2-4 fold over those of parental cells (Figure\u00a03B). These observations are consistent with our previous report in which we observed, using native gel electrophoresis, proficient catalytic capacity of mutated \u03b25 subunit-harboring proteasomes in CEM/BTZ cells for chymotrypsin-like probes, but a diminished inhibitory capacity by bortezomib [9]. Likewise, Kale et al [34] showed that strains of the marine actinobacterium Salinispora tropica could maintain self-resistance to the proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A by expressing a proteasome variant harboring \u03b25 subunit mutations similar to those detected in human THP1/BTZ cells [8,9]. This mutated \u03b25 subunit had retained its capacity to hydrolyze \u03b25-specific substrates, but displayed a diminished sensitivity to inhibition by salinosporamide A.", "The expanding knowledge of factors determining bortezomib sensitivity or resistance that emerged from cell line studies (reviewed in ref [35]), still awaits translation and implementation in a clinical setting. With respect to the role of immunoproteasomes, a recent report from our laboratory showed that higher ratios of immunoproteasome over constitutive proteasome in acute leukemia patient samples served as an important parameter for their ex vivo sensitivity to bortezomib and ONX 0914 [19]. In addition, Shuqing et al [36] showed an increase in constitutive PSMB5 mRNA expression in a myeloma patient after bortezomib treatment compared to the pre-treatment sample. Also recently, Leung-Hagensteijn et al [37] showed that immunoproteasome subunit expression was decreased in patients with myeloma tumors resistant to bortezomib, compared to bortezomib-sensitive patients. This study also revealed that the loss of Xbp1 signaling (which is required for plasma cell differentiation and regulation of unfolded protein response) induced bortezomib-resistance in MM cell lines and patient cells. Based on these considerations, strategies that may increase immunoproteasome levels may merit further exploration for therapeutic intervention.", "Despite the fact that IFN-\u03b3-induced upregulation of immunoproteasomes facilitates sensitization of bortezomib-resistant cells to bortezomib and ONX 0914, IFN-\u03b3 exposure does not establish full restoration of parental sensitivity to bortezomib. This may be due to two reasons; first, inhibition of the catalytic activity of the immunoproteasome alone appears insufficient to exert a cell growth inhibitory effect. Rather, this requires inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity and co-inhibition of caspase-like or trypsin-like activities [38,39]. Second, the constitutive \u03b25 subunit is structurally altered in all 3 bortezomib-resistant tumor cell lines due to mutations in the PSMB5 gene introducing single amino acid substitutions (e.g. Ala49Thr) in the bortezomib-binding pocket leading to diminished bortezomib binding efficiency [8,9]. This structural alteration precludes optimal inhibition of the \u03b25 subunit by bortezomib as present in parental cells, thus retaining a significant degree of bortezomib resistance. These considerations specifically apply for cells with a high level (> 100-fold) of bortezomib resistance. In cells (e.g. 8226/BTZ7 cells) with a more clinically relevant low level (~ 5-fold) resistance to bortezomib, IFN-\u03b3 exposure reversed 50% of bortezomib resistance and achieved parental sensitivity to ONX 0914 (Figure\u00a04D, Additional file 7). The latter observation is consistent with data from Huber et al [40] who showed that incorporation of immunoproteasome subunits confers structural alterations in the 20S proteasome complex, resulting in improved accessibility of ONX 0914 to the active sites, which would underlie a mechanism for the largest differential sensitizing effect observed with ONX 0914 as compared to bortezomib and carfilzomib.", "Knockdown experiments revealed that \u03b25i expression is critically involved in mediating the proteasome inhibitor-sensitizing effects in bortezomib-resistant tumor cells. The role of \u03b25i may first be related to proteasome assembly, in which \u03b25i is required for processing the \u03b21i and \u03b22i subunits [41]. Consistently, \u03b25i deficiency delays immunoproteasome assembly [41]. Beyond increased immunoproteasome subunit expression after IFN-\u03b3 exposure, chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like proteasome catalytic activities were increased, whereas caspase-like activity was decreased. Employing subunit activity-specific probes indicated that the increase in chymotrypsin-like activity was solely accountable for by the increase in \u03b25i but not \u03b25 catalytic activity. At the same time, the decrease in caspase-like activity was solely due to reduced \u03b21 activity since \u03b21i activity actually increased upon stimulation with IFN-\u03b3. Thus, our findings in bortezomib-resistant cells underscore studies showing that replacement of \u03b21 with \u03b21i decreased caspase-like activity and enhanced \u03b25i-associated chymotrypsin-like activity [11,12,42]. Immunologically, a rise in chymotrypsin-like activity would result in the generation of more peptides with hydrophobic C-terminal residues for presentation on MHC class-I molecules [11]. As such, a prominent IFN-\u03b3-induced switch from constitutive to immunoproteasomes in bortezomib-resistant cells could lead to gain of efficiency in antigen presentation by increased peptide loading after immunoproteasome peptide processing. In our study, PSMB8/\u03b25i-downregulation resulted in a 50% decrease of chymotrypsin-like activity, whereas \u03b21i downregulation had no effect on any of the three catalytic activities (data not shown). This phenotype seems fully compatible with that of \u03b25i-deficient mice displaying a 50% decrease in the expression of MHC class-I molecules; these alterations were not observed in \u03b21i- or \u03b22i-deficient mice [13,43,44].", "Kr\u00fcger and Kloetzel [45] suggested that IFN-\u03b3 induction combines enhanced translational activity with a rapid increase in the pool of polyubiquitinated proteins that require processing by the proteasome. In this context, the IFN-\u03b3-induced synthesis of immunoproteasomes may represent a physiological adaptation to this cytokine-induced oxidative stress. If cells under these conditions were to be exposed to proteasome inhibitors, blocking of functional activity of newly formed immunoproteasomes would result in additional accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, causing cell stress and induction of apoptotic cell death. The bortezomib-resistant cell lines did reveal accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins as in bortezomib-sensitive parental cells but at higher bortezomib concentrations to which they are adjusted [8,9]. This is likely due to an adaptive mechanism in bortezomib-resistant cells to enhance the \u03b25-associated catalytic capacity to process physiological substrates (Figure\u00a03B). Interference with this process by IFN-\u03b3 induced upregulation of immunoproteasomes and blocking their function with specific inhibitors could then trigger accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and apoptotic cell death, hence being in line with the mechanism proposed by Kruger and Kloetzel [45]."]
