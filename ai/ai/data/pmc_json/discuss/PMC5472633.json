["Discussion", "The comparison of large numbers of genome sequences derived from closely related bacteria provides a unique opportunity to address bacterial species concepts and the metrics commonly employed to assess sequence-based relationships. Fundamental to this process is the identification of the core genome, which defines the common genomic features that characterize the strains under consideration. As can be expected, core genomes vary widely depending on the diversity of strains and number of genomes examined35\u201338. Nonetheless, this shared gene pool provides unparalleled opportunities to assess levels of sequence divergence and generate comprehensive molecular phylogenies that can be used to infer evolutionary relationships and identify alleles that have been exchanged by homologous recombination.", "Homologous recombination provides a mechanism to repair damaged DNA and generate genetic diversity within bacterial genomes39. While molecular phylogeny is the primary tool used to assess bacterial diversity, it is well documented that homologous recombination blurs species boundaries and can prevent accurate species delineations40. By analyzing the single copy core (SCC) genome associated with 119 closely related Salinispora strains, it was possible to generate a detailed and highly supported phylogeny that revealed three primary lineages in agreement with previously established relationships among the three currently names species19. Although 63% of the SCC showed evidence of recombination for at least one strain, this had no effect on the evolutionary relationships among the three primary clades. However, removing loci that showed evidence of recombination from the analyses revealed enhanced biogeographic patterning within the S. arenicola clade and new evidence for endemism among the structured populations. A majority of genes that displayed evidence of recombination generated phylogenies that were congruent with the established species phylogeny, indicating that most of these events occurred within the three primary lineages as opposed to between them. This is in agreement with the concept that recombination provides a cohesive force that maintains species level units of diversity41. However, the large number of core genes that generated incongruent species phylogenies (27%) reveals the importance of selecting the appropriate phylogenetic markers and the power of phylogenomics to overcome this potential source of misleading phylogenetic inference.", "ANI analyses revealed that the three primary Salinispora clades could be further delineated into as many as 10 different species, all of which could be confidently resolved even when recombinant alleles were included. While three of these lineages are associated with named species21, 22, six belong to the relatively diverse clade that is sister to S. tropica and contains the S. pacifica type strain. This supports the previous suggestion that this clade represents an amalgam of ecotypes or newly diverges species based on its relative low rates of recombination to mutation19. The possibility that 10 species are represented among a group of strains that share 99% 16S sequence identity supports the concept that this conserved phylogenetic marker is not the best choice for species-level resolution4. Nonetheless, 95% ANI corresponded to approximately three changes in the 16S gene thus indicating that any change in this conserved marker may be meaningful from a taxonomic perspective.", "The phylogenetic resolution achieved here is in stark contrast to the genus Streptomyces, where high recombination to mutation rates detected using MLSA approaches led to the suggestion that phylogenetic relationships within this genus were better represented by a reticulate network12. It remains unclear why the effects of recombination on phylogenetic resolution differ between two taxa within the same bacterial order, however it may relate to the diversity of the strains examined and the number of alleles assessed in the different studies. Furthermore, it is interesting to speculate that among Streptomyces spp., the acquisition of alleles resistant to the many antibiotics they produce may contribute to the high levels of homologous recombination observed, as was shown for the rpoB phylogeny in Salinispora spp.19 and exploited to identify the biological targets of secondary metabolites prior to their discovery42.", "In support of this concept, natural product BGCs are frequently exchanged by horizontal gene transfer27 and often include a resistant version of the target on which the encoded compounds act43. These resistance genes often have homologs in the core genome and can appear as a second copy of a housekeeping gene44. In other cases, the resistant housekeeping gene associated with the BGC is the only copy in the genome19, suggesting the ancestral allele was subsequently lost. These later events are difficult to distinguish from homologous recombination and may account for some of the single copy genes identified as under recombination in this study. Thus, the ability to produce and be resistant to secondary metabolites may represent a major factor confounding phylogenetic resolution among bacteria enriched in this metabolic capacity. Nonetheless, phylogenomic approaches were sufficient to overcome these incongruences, leading to the generation of stable trees with highly supported clades that can be further evaluated for species-like properties.", "Linking strains that can be delineated based on phylogeny or sequence similarity with distinct ecological traits remains a critical and challenging component of microbial ecology. In this regard, it was possible to show that the distributions of secondary metabolite BGCs and six COG categories were largely congruent with the 10 candidate Salinispora species delineated based on ANI and resolved in the phylogenomic tree. Thus, there appears to be considerable genetic cohesion among these lineages including within\ufeff the category of secondary metabolism, which has been reported to represent an important species defining trait for this genus45. Ultimately, resolving the genetic and ecological differences among these closely related groups of bacteria, as initially demonstrated between strains of S. tropica and S. arenicola\n28, will be an essential component of testing the hypothesis that they maintain the properties expected of different species. While it remains to be determined if these results apply more broadly to other groups of bacteria, the expansive growth of genome sequence data will provide ample opportunities to explore species concepts in the future."]
