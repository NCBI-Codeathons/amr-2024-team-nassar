["3. Discussion", "Growth periods in Streptomyces are characterized by cell differentiation, hyphal production and secondary metabolism; all these processes are carefully controlled by precise and complex regulatory networks [6]. Of particular interest, the biosyntheses of most secondary metabolites often display a cascade system of regulation consisting of three regulatory levels: global, pleiotropic and pathway-specific regulation. Global and pleiotropic regulatory elements are usually located outside a given BGC whereas pathway-specific regulatory factors are commonly found within specific BGCs and specifically regulate a single antibiotic biosynthetic pathway [25].", "LuxR is a class of pathway-specific regulatory proteins that are involved in a variety of important physiological functions. LuxR family proteins generally act at the genetic level in Streptomyces and are known to regulate secondary metabolism [7]. Here, we found that Atr1 and Atr2, two LuxR-type regulators encoded within the atr cluster of S. atratus SCSIO ZH16NS-80S, positively regulate the biosynthesis of atratumycin. In parallel, SARP family proteins have long been considered to serve as positive regulators of biosynthesis in Streptomyces [26,27]. It is therefore highly interesting and unexpected that we have identified herein, that Atr32, a SARP representative with an NB-ARC domain, acts as a negative regulator of atratumycin assembly. The NB-ARC domain, a signaling motif found in eukaryotes and bacteria, is widely considered to be a regulatory domain that determines whether the protein is active or inactive [28,29]. Based on the sequence analyses of Atr 32 and its gene inactivation results, we speculated that the deletion of the NB-ARC domain in atr32 prevents it from interacting with downstream signals, altering metabolic pathways and enhancing antibiotic production. This hypothesis is in line with the fact that the function of the central NB-ARC domain remains incompletely understood in Streptomyces sp. and requires further research.", "Whole-genome sequencing initiatives have revealed that Streptomyces contains large numbers of transporter genes. In addition to genomics data, this conclusion is based, partly on the well-known ability of Streptomyces to discharge toxins, which might be their secondary metabolites or ingested toxins [30,31]. Thus far, research into ABC transporters in Streptomyces BGCs has been limited; most studies have only investigated whether or not ABC type transporters participate in antibiotic translocation or self-resistance processes by changing the ABC expression levels. The identification of key sites that recognize substrates, the effects of protein structure changes on transport efficiency, and regulatory patterns in ABC transport process have only just begun. Atr29 and Atr30 were both annotated as ABC transporters in the atr cluster and gene inactivation results strongly implicate them as key players in atratumycin secretion and/or resistance (as a means of producer self-defense). Inactivation of either Atr29 or Atr30 completely abolishes atratumycin production. Notably, the dramatic impact that Atr29 or Atr30 inactivation has on biosynthesis is not commonly seen with other ABC transporter-like systems involved in secondary metabolism [32].", "Streptomycetes BGCs often contain both positive and negative regulatory elements. For instance, both fkbN (positive) and tcs7 (negative) regulatory components exist in the FK506 biosynthetic gene cluster [33]. Not surprisingly, increasing positive and decreasing negative regulatory gene expression levels constitute effective methods for improving secondary metabolite titers [23,34,35]. Another approach commonly employed to achieve improved titers is to introduce multiple copies of positive (global or BGC specific) regulatory and/or transporter genes [36]. To some extent, the genetic tractability of the BGC-housing genomes and microbes influences the success of these types of combinatorial biosynthetic approaches. Thus, the ability to express BGCs in genetically tractable heterologous hosts determines, to a large extent, the success of titer improvement efforts based on manipulating regulatory elements. Our demonstration herein that S. coelicolor M1154 serves as a suitable host for over-expression of the atr cluster and subsequent overproduction of atratumycin therefore represents an important advancement. M1154 is a well-known and understood heterologous host for Streptomyces-derived BGCs. Therefore, combined with our identification and demonstrated modulation of regulatory elements of the atr cluster, sets the stage for further mechanistic studies of regulatory pathways employed by marine-derived secondary metabolite pathways. These advances also showcase the means by which to generate new natural products in quantities better able to support development efforts than would otherwise be possible with only WT producers; this holds true for atratumycin as well as many other secondary metabolites."]
