["Discussion", "Mycophenolic acid is a fungal secondary metabolite with a variety of pharmaceutical activities and is widely applied in clinical practices. For its vital importance in the biomedical field, in this study we aimed to isolate a new MPA producer species from the genus Penicillium and to improve its production. Penicillium is a vital industrial unit for the biosynthesis of many chemically and structurally diverse secondary metabolites, including significant pharmaceutical compounds [3]. These compounds include penicillin, roquefortine, chrysogine, and fungisporin which represent the starting point for the investigation of highly efficient antibiotics, a milestone in therapeutic medicine [45]. The most principal scientific discovery of the 20th century was Penicillin antibiotics which were among the first drugs to be effective against several diseases [46]. MPA is one of the most important secondary metabolites, which was discovered in 1893 and has been identified as an essential bioactive substance with immunosuppressive, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, and various activities. It has been produced by many Penicillium species including P. brevicompactum (also known as P. stoloniferum), P. paxilli, P. olivicolor, P. canescens (also known as P. raciborskii), P. roqueforti, and P. viridicatum [47, 48]. In this study, we isolated a new antibiotic-producer strain of P. arizonense from refrigerated Mozzarella cheese, and it was found to be a strong producer of MPA when it was grown in submerged PD broth culture. Large numbers of secondary metabolites, such as tryptoquivalines, pyripyropenes, austalides, fumagillin, pseurotin A, xanthoepocin, and curvulinic acid, were investigated in the cell extract of P. arizonense [3]. The morphological identification and marker gene analysis of rRNA and benA confirmed the highest similarity of our isolate with P. arizonense CBS141311. Because many of the preferable compounds are naturally produced in considerable amounts, fungi have a great potential as specific hosts for the biosynthesis of small molecules. The broad benefit in fungi has led to the hole sequencing of numerous fungal genomes. This number is expected to a dramatically increase in the upcoming years [49]. Information concerning the molecular basis of MPA biosynthesis in P. arizonense would be very helpful for both the potential production of MPA and the control of its contamination in food products; however, there is no previous information about the biosynthetic pathway. In this study, two contigs containing five orthologous genes of MPA gene clusters were identified in the P. arizonense genome, namely, mpaA, mpC, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH. The genes mpaA, which encodes a putative prenyltransferase; mpaC, which encodes a polyketide synthase; mpaDE, which encodes a natural fusion of a cytochrome P450 domain and a hydrolase domain; mpaF, which encodes a protein with high similarity to inosine-5\u00b4-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH); mpaG, which encodes an O-methyltransferase; and mpaH, which encodes an oxidative cleavage enzyme, were identified as gene clusters for MPA biosynthesis in the P. brevicompactum genome. The mpaC gene is responsible for the biosynthesis of 5-methylorsellinic acid (5-MOA), which is the initial step in MPA synthesis. The following conversion of 5-MOA to 4,6-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-methylbenzoic acid and 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methyl phthalide (DHMP) was performed by the enzyme mpaDE. The final step in the biosynthesis process is completed by mpaG (the putative O-methyl transferase), which stimulates the methylation of dimethyl mycophenolic acid (DMMPA) to form MPA. The strong amplification of these genes from the P. arizonense genome indicates their participation in the biosynthesis of MPA. In silico study, no contig containing the ORFs encoding similar proteins to mpaB, mpaE, and mpaD were identified in the genome of P. arizonense. This result indicated that there are no homologous sequences of the three unidentified genes, mpaB, mpaE, and mpaD, with the related orthologous genes of both P. brevicompactum and P. roqueforti. To predict these genes, additional studies are required for the identification of the putative proteins encoded by these genes. The gene cluster encoding MPA was recently investigated in both P. brevicompactum [6] and P. roqueforti [22, 50]. P. arizonense is defined as one of a group that belongs to the Penicillium section Canescentia and contains a large number of genes participating in lipid metabolism and a secondary metabolite production. Sequencing analysis of the P. arizonense genome revealed that it was assembled into 33.7\u00a0Mb containing 12,502 predicted genes [3]. Additionally, 62 putative biosynthetic gene clusters involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis were identified in its genome. Up till now, the putative genes that participated in the P. arizonense genome have not been completely annotated, and their phenotypic action is still under investigation. It was previously investigated whether P. arizonense contains gene clusters responsible for austalide (meroterpenoid) production. Mycophenolic acid is an important compound related to meroterpenoids that is composed of a terpene-derived side chain and an acetate-derived phthalide nucleus [51]. This phthalide structure is also present in the austalides, so it is likely that austalides and mycophenolic acid have identical biosynthetic gene clusters. Orthologs to mpaC, mpaD, and mpaA genes evolving in the MPA biosynthesis cluster of P. brevicompactum were found in the P. arizonense genome [3]. This report agrees with our investigation, where a homologous partial sequence of 5 genes with locus tags, PENARI_c010G07427, PENARI_c010G07355, PENARI_c010G04864, PENARI_c005G09215, and PENARI_c010G08752, were annotated in the P. arizonense genome, and they were found to be orthologs to the MPA gene cluster mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH, respectively, in P. brevicompactum. The use of mutations to improve several microorganisms for the overproduction of industrial products has been applied for over 50 years and is still accepted as a valuable agent for the improvement of different microbial strains. The random mutagenesis against the wild type of fungal strains leads to a series of mutants, some of them change the production of target secondary metabolite. Most improvements lead to a decrease or lack of production change, but some mutants may show an increase in the production of secondary metabolite. Through the exposure of wild-type P. arizonense to random mutagenesis by gamma irradiation, potential producer mutants for MPA were obtained. We succeeded in isolating three stable mutants of P. arizonense that had the ability to produce approximately double the amount of MPA compared with the wild-type strain. This result indicates the technological modification of our isolate to be more productive for MPA. Such a mutagenic strain could minimize the cost of the manufacturing processes and enhance the productivity of MPA. The improvement of MPA production was previously investigated by exposing P. brevicompactum to 250\u00a0Gy of gamma radiation, which led to an increase in MPA production productivity by 25% [38]. Gamma rays may cause various mutations in the gene cluster regulating several secondary metabolites, leading to an increase or decrease in their production [52]. These metabolites are regulated by a network of master regulators. One such regulator is the Velvet protein complex which is mainly conserved as the regulator of the fungal evaluation and secondary metabolism [53]. A key regulator of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites is the LAEA protein that interacts with other components of the velvet complex. The overproduction of MPA may also result from the modification of different processes such as inhibition or secretion of other secondary metabolites in the mutant strains. The variation in the colored pigments of the mutant\u2019s metabolite indicated the production of other secondary metabolites compared to the wild-type strain. This result indicated that the mutated programs affect other genes such as lea and velvet genes which control secondary metabolites production and this likely has impacted the expression of several secondary metabolites encoding genes [54]. Because P. arizonense is considered a new producer strain for MPA, the eco-physiological parameters for its production must be optimized to achieve maximum productivity. The incubation temperature and time were effective factors in the production activity of MPA by both wild-type and mutant strains. Generally, like other secondary metabolites, the production of MPA was noticed to be increased during the stationary phase of fungal growth. MPA is a secondary metabolite, so its production was affected by the time of incubation, where the elongation of incubation time to 10 and 15 days enhanced the productivity of our experimental strains. Similarly, Vinokurova et al. [55] reported that MPA synthesis was dramatically concentrated during the stationary phase of growth after 10 days of incubation. This investigation agrees with our results, where the mycelial growth of all mutant and wild-type strains did not correlate with MPA production. Additionally, the initial pH value and the incubation temperature were critical factors affecting the production of MPA by P. arizonense. The highest production of MPA was observed when all fungal strains were grown on PD broth adjusted to initial pH 6 and incubated at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Accompanied by our results, Patel et al. [56] recorded that the optimum culture conditions for maximum production of MPA were detected after incubation of P. brevicompactum for 12 d at 25\u00a0\u00b0C using pH 5 as an initial value. Additionally, Wu et al.. [57] reported that MPA production was 58.1% higher under optimum fermentation conditions than that initial fermentation condition without optimizations. Overproduction of MPA in mutated strains was confirmed with expression analysis of the main predicted MPA biosynthesizing genes. Expression analysis of these genes in all MPA over producer mutants showed a highly significant fold increase over the wild type after incubation times of 5 and 10 days. Additionally, the expression values of all genes were higher after 10 d than after 5 d of incubation. This result agrees with the physiological study of MPA production by mutant and wild-type strains of P. arizonense, where the amount of MPA was significantly higher in all mutant strains compared to wild-type and increased after 10 d of incubation compared to 5 d. The obtained results indicated a positive relationship between the transcription value of the MPA genes, mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH, and the production of MPA under different environmental conditions. Additionally, these results confirmed the vital role of the annotated genes in the biosynthesis pathway, which was considered an indication of the capability of the P. arizonense HEwt strain to produce MPA in submerged culture. The significant similarity between the five sequence amplicons with their related putative protein-encoding genes of P. arizonense CBS141311, deposited in the GenBank database, is considered strong evidence for the correct identification of our strain. This is the first report concerning the overproduction of MPA by P. arizonense, in addition to the expression analysis of the orthologous MPA genes and their correlation with phenotypic analysis. This investigation could be a new platform for the industrial biosynthesis of this vital compound using a new producer species of Penicillium and considered a new annotation of five MPA genes shared in MPA biosynthesis in the P. arizonense genome."]
