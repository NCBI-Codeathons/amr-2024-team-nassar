["3. Discussion", "In this study, CDS regions of two MLO genes, namely, CsMLO1 and CsMLO2, were cloned and identified. A sequence analysis showed that the CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 proteins had seven typical transmembrane domains and a CaMBD, and these domain modules were similar to those of CaMLO1, AtMLO2, AtMLO6, BrMLO1 and HvMLO1 [14,44,45]. The cucumber CaMBD1 domain of CsMLO1 interacts with CsCaM3 via yeast two-hybrid, firefly luciferase (LUC) complementation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments [46]. Plasma membrane proteins may participate in defense mechanisms against biological stress [47]. Studies of barley mlo mutant plants have indicated that MLO proteins play a negative regulatory role in the defense response [14,48]. Three closely related MLO co-orthologs (AtMLO2, AtMLO6, and AtMLO12) in clade V were mutated to achieve complete resistance to Golovinomyces orontii [16,49]. In our study, a phylogenetic analysis showed that a similar number of MLO family genes were predicted in cucumber and CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 were classified into the same clade as AtMLO2, AtMLO6, AtMLO12, BrMLO1 and CaMLO1. The results indicated that loss of function of CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 could play a role in cucumber defense. Pepper CaMLO2 is localized in the plasma membrane and involved in the susceptibility cell-death response and bacterial and oomycete proliferation [43]. A subcellular localization analysis showed that the CsMLO1::GFP and CsMLO2::GFP fusion proteins appeared solely in the plasma membrane as fusion proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells. These results were consistent with the localization of CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 in cucumber protoplasts [46]. Therefore, it was further demonstrated that these results were consistent with the subcellular localization results of most MLO disease-resistance genes, and CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 showed potential functions in the plasma membrane.", "Traditionally, MLO function has been associated with susceptibility/resistance to powdery mildew (PM) disease [13]. A deletion variant (\u2206174) of CsaMLO8 has lost its function as a susceptibility gene, thus leading to PM resistance in complementation of the tomato mlo-mutant [50]. In recent years, studies have also found that the MLO gene is involved in regulating other pathogens [17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. In cucumber\u2013C. cassiicola interactions, the role of the MLO gene is unclear. Here, we found that the lesion area was significantly higher in susceptible cucumbers than in resistant cucumbers. CsMLO1 expression was upregulated in resistant and susceptible cultivars challenged with C. cassiicola. Compared with the resistant cultivar at 48 h, the susceptible cultivar showed highly upregulated CsMLO1 expression. CsMLO2 expression was initially downregulated in the resistant and susceptible cultivars challenged with C. cassiicola and then upregulated at 48 h. Similarly, CsMLO2 expression was highly upregulated in the susceptible cultivar. These results suggested that the maximum accumulation of CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 in the susceptible cultivar appeared earlier than that in the resistant cultivar in the defense response to C. cassiicola. Currently, due to the limitation of cucumber transgenic technology, research on the disease-resistance mechanism of the MLO gene has been hampered in cucumber. However, an experimental method for the transient agroinfiltration of cucumber cotyledons has been established [51]. In this study, we first successfully obtained transgenic cucumbers that showed transient silencing and overexpression of CsMLO1/CsMLO2. Next, a functional analysis revealed that CsMLO1/CsMLO2-silenced plants showed strongly enhanced resistance to C. cassiicola, although CsMLO1/CsMLO2-overexpressing plants showed evidently impaired resistance to C. cassiicola in the transient transgenic cucumbers. ROS accumulation and lignin deposition also occurred earlier in CsMLO1/CsMLO2-silenced cucumbers than CsMLO1/CsMLO2-overexpressing cucumbers after C. cassiicola infection. Wang has shown that secondary metabolism and ROS accumulation play important roles in disease resistance during cucumber-C. cassiicola interactions [25]. Thus, we initially concluded that CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 might be negative regulatory modulators involved in the cucumber defense response to C. cassiicola.", "In Arabidopsis, clade V MLOs act as negative regulators of ROS signaling, which suggests that ROS signaling is a general feature of MLO proteins [30,52,53]. Normally, plants trigger ROS signaling in response to both abiotic and biotic stresses. In cucumber, CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 were classified into the same clade as clade V AtMLOs. Thus, cucumber CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 are likely associated with ROS signaling in response to C. cassiicola. In addition, high concentrations of ROS chemicals trigger plant HR against the invasion of pathogens [54,55]. AtrbohD and AtrbohF are associated with the production of ROS in response to ABA and pathogen infection, such as Pseudomonas syringae and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsis [31,32,56]. In our study, we found that transcript levels of CsMLO1 were suppressed by treatment with H2O2, whereas transcript levels of CsRbohD and CsRbohF were increased in CsMLO1-silenced cucumbers. Meanwhile, increased antioxidant enzymes and H2O2 and O2\u2212\u00b7 accumulation were observed in CsMLO1-silenced cucumbers. Similar results were observed in an earlier study of the response to ROS, which was identified using publicly available gene expression data of the mlo2-6 mlo6-2 mlo12-1 mutant [17,30]. This pattern suggested that ROS signaling might be preactivated in the CsMLO1-silencing cucumber to improve defense resistance to C. cassiicola.", "The calcium signal and the reactive oxygen species signal are inseparable in plants. Ca2+ influx can induces the production of reactive oxygen species, which can activate Ca2+ influx. Cytosolic Ca2+ transients modulate RbohD- and RbohF-mediated ROS accumulation as well as calmodulin (CaM)-mediated defense signaling [57,58,59,60,61]. ROS can act as secondary signals in the activation of a series of downstream pathogenesis-related proteins [62]. Cucumber CsCaM3 is a positive modulator that enhances the defense response of C. cassiicola infection, but CsMLO1 is a negative modulator to enhance the defense response of cucumbers and stably interacts with CsCaM3 and transfers CsCaM3 in the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, thereby blocking the accumulation of CsCaM3 [41]. Cucumber CsMLO1 silencing significantly enhances the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes (CsPO1, CsRbohD, and CsRbohF), defense marker genes (CsPR1 and CsPR3), CsCaM3 and callose deposition-related gene (CsGSL) under C. cassiicola infection [41]. Additionally, the coexpression of CsCaM3 and CsMLO1 significantly inhibited hypersensitive cell death after C. cassiicola infection, suggesting that CsMLO1 negatively regulates CsCaM3 expression, which results in the inhibition of defense-related gene activation. In our study, the transcript level of PR1-1a was only increased in CsMLO1-silenced cucumbers. The transcript levels of PR2 and PR3 were significantly increased in the CsMLO1/CsMLO2-silenced cucumbers compared with the TRV:00-injected cucumbers, whereas PR3 expression was reduced in the CsMLO1/CsMLO2-overexpressing cucumbers. These results are consistent with the results of Xue, who reported that the enhanced expression of defense-related genes improved disease resistance against B. cinerea in Arabidopsis [63]. The CsMLO1 gene and CsMLO2 gene belong to the same family, and they are involved in the same defense pathways against pathogens, such as active oxygen bursts and lignin deposition; however, different regulatory mechanisms are observed, such as activation of different pathogenesis-related proteins. Different expression patterns of PR proteins also indicated the possible genetic redundancy between CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 paralogs in the regulation of PR genes. In summary, CsMLO1 silencing activates calcium signaling and reactive oxygen species signaling pathways, and crosstalk between Ca2+ signaling and ROS signals may jointly activate downstream pathogenesis-related gene expression and antioxidant enzyme activity. Negative regulatory modes of CsMLO2 in cucumber might be related to PR protein defense against C. cassiicola.", "In plants, complex signaling transduction pathways occur in plant\u2013pathogen interactions [64]. The modulation of ABA signaling plays a crucial role in plant stress responses. An example of virus-induced silencing in pepper plants suggested that CaMLO2 acts as a negative regulator of ABA signaling in drought stress responses [65]. In this study, we detected the expression of CsPYL2, CsPP2C2 and CsSnRK2.2, which initiate ABA signal transduction, and found that CsMLO1 negatively modulated the expression of PYL2 and CsPP2C2 and positively modulated the expression of SnRK2.2. Moreover, endogenous ABA also showed the same trend as the gene expression in CsMLO1-silenced/overexpressing cucumbers. Thus, we speculated that CsMLO1 might be involved in and regulate the ABA signaling pathway. ABA is an important signaling molecule in plant\u2013pathogen interactions [66,67,68]. In this study, a functional analysis showed that CsMLO1 silencing significantly increased the expression of CsABI5, although the transcript level of CsABI5 was inhibited in CsMLO1-overexpressing cucumbers. Changes in the expression levels of CsABI5 directly demonstrated the involvement of CsMLO1 in ABA signaling in defense responses. Furthermore, these results were relatively similar to the augmented CsMLO1 response to C. cassiicola, indicating that CsMLO1-silencing signals mediated and enhanced the response against the pathogen. Previous evidence showed that ABA levels were correlated with resistance to pathogen stress and that ABI5 was highly induced in a resistant line compared with a susceptible line after S. fuliginea infestation [69]. These results are also consistent with the response of CsMLO1 to C. cassiicola, which was associated with the ABA signaling pathway. The research find that ABA stimulate the influx of calcium ions in the leaves of maize seedlings, which in turn increased the activity of plasma membrane NADPH oxidase and the production of O2\u2212\u00b7, resulting in an increase in ROS content [70]. ABA and H2O2 can activate Ca2+-CaM targets and upregulate antioxidant enzyme activity [71,72,73]. Together, these findings suggest that the functional role of CsMLO1 in the defense response to C. cassiicola was also correlated with ABA signaling. The CsMLO1 silencing increased the content of endogenous ABA and upregulated the expression of related genes in cucumber leaves, and activated the ROS signal and Ca2+-CaM signaling pathway. However, the above assays found that the transcription level of CsMLO2 was affected by exogenous ABA while the expression of ABA-related genes showed a downward trend compared with that of the control in CsMLO2-silenced/overexpressing cucumbers. These findings further suggest that although CsMLO2 also regulated ABA signaling, whether this signaling is involved in defense against C. cassiicola remains unclear.", "In conclusion, the cucumber CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 genes were identified as negative regulators of the defense response to C. cassiicola. Combined with the previous studies and the results of this study, it was found that CsMLO1 as a negative regulator mainly adopted the following resistance pathways. CsMLO1-silenced mainly activated the expression of Ca2+-, ROS-, ABA- signaling-related genes, thereby improving the resistance of cucumber to C. cassiicola by regulating crosstalk between the three signaling; The interaction of CsMLO1 and Ca2+-CaM inhibited HR response mainly including ROS burst, CaM and pathogenesis-related gene expression. Furthermore, cucumber CsMLO2 regulated the expression of some pathogenesis-related proteins, which influenced the defense response to C. cassiicola. Taken together, these studies will provide novel insights into the important roles of CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 in the defense responses to C. cassiicola."]
