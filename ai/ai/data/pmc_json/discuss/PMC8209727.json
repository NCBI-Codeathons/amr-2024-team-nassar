["Discussion", "Acquisition of the pks island in the population of \nE. coli\n appears to have involved two distinct mechanisms differing by the presence or absence of a phage-type integrase. The integrase-mediated pks insertion pathway occurred mainly in B2 strains and resulted in pks insertion into either of three asn tRNA genes (i.e. asnU, asnV or asnW). This potential for integration into several DNA targets is consistent with the observed conservation and genetic integrity of the pks integrative module, i.e. the integrase gene and the two direct repeats flanking the island. The flexibility of pks insertion is reminiscent of what has been described for the HPI of \nYersinia pseudotuberculosis\n which is also able to insert into either of the three Y. pseudotuberculosis asn tRNA genes [41], in contrast to the immobile truncated form of the HPI in \nE. coli\n whose right direct repeat is deleted and whose location is fixed at the asnT tRNA gene [42]. A divergent integrase sequence was found for the pks island inserted into the asnU tRNA gene compared to those inserted into the asnV or asnW tRNA gene. As the three asn tRNA sequences are 100\u200a% identical, the use of either of them as an attachment site by slightly different integrases probably reflects distinct histories of pks acquisition. After pks chromosomal integration, the endogenous pks integrase promoter is replaced by the promoter of the upstream asn tRNA gene (Fig. S6), a configuration similar to that found for the HPI integrase promoter [43]. Whether the site of integration influences the expression of the pks integrase and hence pks stability at the distinct asn tRNA loci is not known. In contrast to the integrase-mediated pathway, the pks chromosomal integration process in the B1 and A \nE. coli\n strains remains unclear as no site-specific recombinase-encoding gene was found near pks and chromosomal insertion occurred into a non-tRNA locus. In these strains, pks integration could have involved the participation of IS elements such as the IS66 whose truncated or intact copies were found to flank the pks island.", "The co-phylogeny analysis between the core genome- and pks-based phylogenetic trees shed further light on pks acquisition scenarios. In the case of the typical pks-positive B2 strains belonging to lineages from major CCs (i.e. CC12, CC14, CC73 and CC95), the congruence observed between both trees suggested that the pks island was horizontally acquired by the MRCA of these lineages, or by the MRCA of each of these, and then stably maintained in their descendants through vertical transmission. The fact that strains of certain CC95 subgroups lack the pks island probably suggests that pks was lost during the evolution of these sublineages. Such a loss might be closely linked to the change in the relative fitness of CC95 subgroups underlying the variations observed in their spatial and temporal distribution in several continents [35]. In the case of B1 or A strains, pks acquisition and dissemination probably occurred through sporadic lateral transfer events, as pks-positive B1 or A strains were scarce and not genetically related. The horizontal transferability of the pks island has previously been demonstrated using an in vitro approach where pks could be transferred together with the HPI via F\u2019 plasmid-mediated conjugation from a donor to a recipient \nE. coli\n strain [44]. We propose that pks acquisition by the single pks-positive D strain ECSC054 was mediated by HGT, presumably from a B2 donor strain given the pks sequence relatedness observed between the D and B2 strains. HGT was also probably involved in the exchange of the pks island between the three atypical B2 ST73 or ST95 strains and a (yet unknown) phylogenetically distant donor strain, since their pks sequences did not cluster with those from other B2 ST73 or ST95 strains. This hypothesis was further supported by the identification, in these three isolates, of an ICE-like element inserted in their pks island. Similar ICE-like elements have previously been identified in three B1 \nE. coli\n isolates and other members of the Enterobacteriacae such as \nC. koseri\n, \nEnterobacter aerogenes\n and \nK. pneumoniae\n [6]. They could therefore play a role in pks dissemination in enterobacteria, as proposed for the self-transmissible ICE linked to the HPI identified in the \nE. coli\n strain ECOR31 [38]. Due to its lack of a complete DNA mobilization region (region II), we assume that the ICE-linked pks island is no longer self-transferable. It might nevertheless correspond to a remnant of an ancient, complete and self-transmissible ICE-linked pks island that could have behaved as a large complex ICE and spread in enterobacteria before undergoing partial or entire deletion of the ICE region. To date, no bacterial strain carrying a complete ICE linked to pks has been identified and the origin of the pks island therefore remains elusive.", "The ecological niche and/or genetic background of the bacterial strains probably had an impact on the acquisition and stable maintenance of pks. The high concentration of pks-positive strains in some CCs of the B2 group such as CC73 and CC95 suggests that pks might have contributed to their ecological and evolutionary success. CC73 and CC95 exhibit a similar phylogenetic history and are major ExPEC lineages, especially prior to the year 2000 where they were the most commonly detected [1, 45]. They are persistent intestinal colonizers and successful extra-intestinal pathogens with the particularity of exhibiting lower multidrug resistance levels compared to other ExPEC lineages. By contrast, as our collection contained \nE. coli\n B2 strains from STs other than ST73 and ST95, it was interesting to note that pks was absent from STs corresponding to separate B2 lineages in the \nE. coli\n phylogenetic tree, including the ST131 clonal complex which is associated with multidrug resistance and is now the most predominantly isolated ExPEC lineage worldwide [45]. Consistent with the hypothesis of a pks acquisition by the MRCA(s) of CC73 and CC95 mentioned above, this finding suggests that such acquisition probably occurred after they diverged from the MRCA of CC131, i.e. before going through distinct evolutionary trajectories. The inversion of the upstream asnW-asnU-asnV tRNA-containing region which probably accompanied pks insertion into the asnW tRNA gene in the B2 group might have contributed to pks stabilization at this locus. Since the various pks-positive and pks-negative B2 lineages occupy the same ecological niche (i.e. primarily the intestinal tract of humans and animals), horizontal transfer of pks between them could have been expected, at least to some extent, but which was not revealed here. Several hypotheses can be proposed to explain this. First, some barriers to HGT might exist between members of distinct CCs, such as restriction-modification systems [46]. Second, pks might have been transferred to recipient strains without providing adaptive value, thus resulting in its rapid loss. Third, as crosstalk between virulence determinants and the chromosome backbone is required for the emergence of virulent clones [1], a specific chromosomal phylogenetic background might be required for appropriate pks expression and production of an adaptive value, thereby constituting a prerequisite for the stable maintenance of the island.", "The structure of the pks island is very well conserved among the \nE. coli\n population, with more than 99\u200a% identity, suggesting that its integrity remains under strong structural and functional evolutionary constraints. We can speculate that transcription and translation of the 19 pks genes of this 54 kb long genomic island would be too high for the bacterial strains if the pks island did not bring a selective advantage to them. This is reinforced by the fact that only 18 out of 109 pks-positive strains lacked genotoxic activity. The importance of the biological role of pks is highlighted by the numerous activities associated with this genetic island, including genotoxicity, anti-inflammatory activity, antibiotic and analgesic effects. Given its interplay with siderophores (enterobactin, salmochelin and yersiniabactin) and siderophore-microcins (MccM and MccH47) [10, 22, 47], the pks island contributes to bacterial competition through the acquisition of iron or the production of inhibitory compounds, respectively. Protection of bacterial cells from genomic degradation through the production of ClbS could also be advantageous to pks-carrrying strains, as this multifunctional protein not only directly inactivates colibactin but also protects bacterial DNA from nucleolytic degradation by nucleases [48]. We also observed that non-genotoxic \nE. coli\n strains carrying an altered pks island still produced the prodrug motif C14-Asn synthesized at the early stage of the biosynthesis process, suggesting that yet-to-be-discovered bioactive compounds are produced by these strains. Given the high conservation observed for the pks island in \nE. coli\n, we can thus speculate that colibactin is a very important genotoxin but that pks-derived synthesis of other secondary metabolites could also be an advantage for \nE. coli\n.", "Although our collection is characterized by a large diversity of \nE. coli\n strains from various phylogenetic groups and STs, one limitation of this study is that only strains from Japan were included, which may not be representative of the distribution of pks in a global collection of \nE. coli\n isolates from worldwide sources.", "In conclusion, the various genetic configurations of the pks island and its distribution in the \nE. coli\n phylogenetic tree imply the existence of various scenarios for the introduction and spread of pks into the \nE. coli\n population. The presence of a functional pks island was demonstrated for the majority of the pks-positive strains, suggesting that the pks island is under selective pressure for the adaptation of \nE. coli\n to various ecological niches, through the production of colibactin or other secondary metabolites."]
