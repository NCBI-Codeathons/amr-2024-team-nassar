["4. Discussion", "Obesity can lead to the impairment of learning and memory capacity, which is confirmed by increasing studies. However, the molecular mechanisms for the impairment of learning and memory capacity caused by obesity are unclear. The 1\u20136-months-old C5BL/6 mice are equivalent to 12\u201330-year-old humans during the rapid development period to adult period [20]. Therefore, this study highly mimicked the development of the adolescent population with obesity using 4-week-old young male mouse models fed with a high-fat diet to obesity for 3 months, which can avoid the uncertain factors such as the physiological cycle of female mice as soon as possible. Exercise is an important external means to promote the development of brain function accompanied by the suppression of obesity [21]. However, considering the risk of exercise injury caused by larger body weight, this study adopted a swimming intervention for 2 months. The experimental results were consistent with the expectation. Swimming intervention significantly reduced body weight, alleviated neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, and up-regulated neurotrophic factors to achieve the reversal of learning and memory function in obese mice.", "The occurrence of obesity may lead to a significant decline in memory, but some studies have found that the decline in cognitive function caused by a high-fat diet may precede the occurrence of obesity [22]. Relevant studies have shown that short-term [23] and long-term exposure [15] to high-fat diets can result in the obesity-induced impairment of learning and memory capacity. Only 4 days of high-fat and high-sugar diets in humans can impair hippocampal-dependent learning and memory function to some extents [24]. The 7\u20139-year-old adolescents with the long-term intake of saturated fatty acids present a negative correlation with learning and memory function [25], as confirmed by the same performance in Zebrafish [26], which stimulates the interest in exploring the beneficial effect of regular exercise intervention on the mitigation of the HFD-induced impairment of learning and memory function and precision mechanisms through the mouse model, thereby providing a reference or guidance for health promotion. However, in 12-month-term HFD feeding, rats showed better learning and memory capacity and larger hippocampal volume [27], and the consumption of HFD for 6 months showed no spatial memory impairment [28]. This phenomenon, that a long-term high-fat diet does not trigger the changes in learning and memory capacity, may be related to stress, self-resistance, and the adaptation of neurons to high-fat diets, but the specific mechanisms need to be further explored. Similarly, the level of inflammation from high-fat diets can be altered with a change in the duration of diet interventions [29]. Although there is disagreement about the relationship between the duration of high-fat diet intervention and the impairment of learning and memory capacity, it has been widely reported and recognized that obesity can impair learning and memory capacity.", "From the point of view of molecular mechanisms, the impaired learning and memory capacity may be related to the increased level of hippocampal inflammation caused by high-fat diets [8]. It has been widely proven that obesity can increase inflammation in the body, with a similar effect on brain tissue [30]. A cross-sectional study with 10,000 persons in the USA has demonstrated that the level of inflammation is negatively correlated with memory, and it also has the reference value in complex environments [31]. The exposure of juvenile rats to HFD-induced inflammation and reduced learning and cognitive function [32,33]. In a clinical trial with a large volume of samples involving more than 8000 adolescents and children, the results showed that the level of inflammation in obese adolescents is usually accompanied by poor learning and memory capacity [34]. The mice subjected to the consumption of short-term high-fat diets can result in the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in hippocampal tissues [35]. Once JNK is activated, it can act on NF-\u03baB to enter the nucleus to promote the transcription of inflammatory genes, thus resulting in the release of more inflammatory factors, eventually forming a vicious circle and aggravating the degree of inflammation and impaired learning and cognitive capacity [36]. After reducing inflammation, the dietary intervention can fully or partially rescue the impaired cognition of obese mice. Therefore, reducing inflammation may be a solid inducer to delay or suppress the reduction of learning and memory function [37]. In the present study, the impaired learning and memory capacity of the obese mice was highly modulated by the expression levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB p65, and JNK in hippocampal tissues, and a regular swimming intervention can significantly down-regulate these inflammatory proteins. This is consistent with the significant reduction of inflammation levels in the hippocampal tissues of animal models subjected to treadmill running, swimming, or voluntary wheeling running interventions [38,39,40].", "Inflammation caused by obesity may be an important factor associated with insulin resistance [41]. Previous studies have also documented that adolescent mice fed with high-fat diets present an increased level of inflammation in hippocampal tissues, and insulin signaling is also significantly blocked [42,43]. As a bridge between inflammation and insulin, inflammatory factors promote the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at the Ser307 site by activating JNK phosphorylation, thereby hindering insulin signaling and exacerbating insulin resistance. Long-term chronic inflammation can activate JNK and eventually lead to the occurrence of insulin resistance [44]. Insulin resistance in the hippocampal tissue is considered one of the important triggers for the decline in learning and memory function; therefore, activating the insulin signaling pathway can rescue impaired learning and memory capacity [45]. In our study, the similar results with increased expression levels of the proteins associated with the signal pathways of insulin resistance such as JNK/IRS-1/PI3K/Akt in the hippocampal tissues of the obese mice were observed, and the swimming intervention rescued the abnormal expression of these proteins (Figure 5), further suggesting impaired learning and memory capacity due to the insulin resistance from high-fat diets, and alleviated the obesity state and recovered insulin resistance for enhancing learning and memory capacity upon regular exercise intervention.", "In addition, neurotrophic factors and synaptic plasticity are closely related to improving learning and memory functions. In the present study, the expression levels of PGC-1\u03b1, BDNF, and PSD95 showed a downward trend in the hippocampal tissues of obese mice, as consistency with the literature reports describing the alleviation of learning and memory impairment caused by soybean oil-induced BDNF reduction [39]. As an important neurotrophic factor, BDNF can play a critical role in the release and reception of neurotransmitters in presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, thus promoting the connection between synapses and even the regeneration of nerves, thereby improving learning and memory functions. As an intracellular protein, PSD95 plays a vital role in neuronal synaptic plasticity and learning and memory functions [46]. A previous study has also found that exercise can inhibit the reduction of BNDF in the hippocampal tissue of an obesity model [47]. The feeding of high-fat diets for 3-month-old mice can trigger the reduction of the PSD95 level [48], and both aerobic exercise and resistance exercise training can up-regulate hippocampal PSD95 expression [49,50]. Therefore, a swimming intervention for enhancing the learning and memory capacity of obese adolescents may partly depend on the activation of the PGC-1\u03b1/BDNF signal pathway.", "The long-term consumption of high-fat diets may be detrimental to the survival of hippocampal neurons, and corresponding studies have shown that exercise interventions can promote the improvement of hippocampal function by suppressing the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, thereby enhancing learning and memory capacity [19]. Exercise can inhibit the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in obese offspring [51], which is similar to our experimental results with the up-regulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, down-regulated pro-apoptotic protein Bax, and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio (Figure 6), as well as the reduced expression of the proteins in hippocampal tissues associated with inflammation and insulin resistance upon the swimming intervention (Figure 4 and Figure 5). However, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated ROS level caused by high-fat diets, gut microbiome change, and combinatorial stress responses under different dietary conditions may also be important triggers for neuronal apoptosis [33,51,52,53,54,55]. Consistently, aerobic exercise plays a positive role in reducing hippocampal neuronal apoptosis.", "As is well known, dietary modification is another important way to mitigate obesity and enhance learning and cognitive capacity. In order to better understand the effect of exercise intervention on regulating the progression of obesity, in our study, the benefits of exercise intervention were significantly highlighted. Swimming intervention can alleviate inflammatory responses, promote insulin sensitivity, up-regulate neurotrophic factors, increase synaptic plasticity, and suppress apoptosis (Figure 4B,C and Figure 5A), as well as rescue insulin resistance signaling (Figure 5B\u2013D), suggesting that better nutritional supplementation combined with regular exercise training during the rapid development stage of the body may have more benefits, including the rescuing of the high-fat diets-induced impairment of learning and memory capacity."]
