["DISCUSSION", "The evolution of the ability to synthesize specialized \u201csecondary\u201d metabolites is considered to have been crucial for the survival and diversification of fungal species (11, 25). Monascus spp. and other filamentous fungi produce naphthoquinones such as monasones A and B that may inhibit or kill other microorganisms in the natural ecosystem (15, 16), thereby providing an adaptive advantage to their producers. Inevitably, naphthoquinone-producing fungi also must evolve self-protection mechanisms against their own SMs to avoid suicide. These mechanisms may involve active efflux, which also helps to \u201cbroadcast\u201d these antimicrobial agents into the environment, and modification of residual SMs inside the producer cells to reduce their toxicity (11, 26).", "Based on the results described in the present study, we propose a model for the biosynthesis and detoxification of the antifungal and antibiotic monasones in M. ruber M7 (Fig.\u00a06). MrPigA and MrPigN, encoded by genes in the MABGC regulated by MrPigB, catalyze the biosynthesis of monasone A (compound 3) and monasone B (compound 4) via the intermediate trihydroxynaphthalene 2. MrPigP, a multidrug transporter also encoded by the MrPigB regulon of the MABGC, exports these toxic metabolites out of the mycelia, thereby protecting M. ruber M7 and inhibiting competing microorganisms in the environment. Meanwhile, residual monasones A and B inside the cells may be reduced to nontoxic compounds such as trihydroxytetralone 12 and tetrahydroxytetralin 16 by MrPigH also encoded by the MrPigB regulon, with the help of MrPigC from MonAzP biosynthesis or other reductases of M. ruber M7. Presumably, compounds 12 and 16 may be recycled through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle following aromatic ring cleavage (27).", "FIG\u00a06Model for monasone biosynthesis, export, and reductive detoxification in M. ruber M7.

The MABGC has previously been considered to have evolved to produce azaphilone pigments (MonAzPs) and to yield metabolites such as trihydroxynaphthalene 2 and monasone A (compound 3) only as shunt products upon the blockade of the normal course of MonAzP assembly (15, 16). However, we believe that this view of monasones as mere derailment products is unjustified. First, monasone production is elicited upon challenge by various microorganisms (Table S3 [19]), and these compounds show antifungal and antibacterial activities (Table S5 [19]). Second, the monasone subcluster encodes not only biosynthetic enzymes but also a transcriptional regulator and proteins responsible for two distinct monasone resistance mechanisms (Fig.\u00a02). Third, orthologues of mrpigA whose nrPKS products generate a common polyketide intermediate for naphthoquinone congeners and MonAzPs are much more widely associated with genes that are involved in naphthoquinone biosynthesis, resistance, and regulation than with those that are specific for MonAzP production (Fig.\u00a02). In fact, several genes in MABGCs were found not to play an essential role in azaphilone biosynthesis (15, 16). Consequently, we propose that naphthoquinones are bona fide SMs whose biosynthetic mechanisms served as the foundation for the evolution of MonAzP biosynthesis in a group of naphthoquinone-producing fungi. Thus, MonAzP biosynthesis sequesters the pluripotent and unstable polyketide intermediate 1 to afford azaphilones, metabolites that occupy a distinct segment of the SM structural space compared to that by the ancestral naphthoquinones. Nevertheless, the two pathways remain intertwined not only by the corresponding genes being physically colocated on the chromosome but also by several enzymes playing double duty in the two pathways.", "MrPigC and its functional equivalent(s) in M. ruber M7 reduce the C-11 carbonyl of intermediate 1\nen route to MonAzPs, and MrPigH contributes to (although is not strictly necessary for) the reduction of enolic intermediates to afford yellow MonAzPs such as monascin and ankaflavin (15). However, the same enzymes also take part in the reduction of the analogous carbons in monasone derivatives to eliminate the self-toxicity of residual intracellular naphthoquinones (Fig.\u00a04). In contrast, MrPigN is also involved in both pathways but in different capacities. For MonAzP biosynthesis, MrPigN hydroxylates the C-4 position of benzaldehyde 5, while for naphthoquinone biosynthesis, the same enzyme facilitates C1/C10 aldol condensation in intermediate 1 to afford monasone A (compound 3), with only minor amounts of C-4 hydroxylated analogues produced (Fig.\u00a01).", "Another level of connection is provided by the cluster-specific regulator MrPigB that affects both pathways through controlling the expression of MrPigA (an nrPKS). This regulator also controls most of the identified genes of the naphthoquinone pathway (mrpigN, mrpigH, and mrpigP), while only a small subset of the MonAzP genes belong to the MrPigB regulon (Fig.\u00a02). Similar composite \u201csuperclusters\u201d responsible for the production of more than one SM each were also observed recently in other fungi such as Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus nidulans, and Aspergillus fumigatus (28\u201330). These superclusters have evolved by expansion, merger, and diversification of ancestral gene clusters responsible for the production of archetypal SMs. Just as with the monasone-MonAzP biosynthetic gene supercluster, certain genes of these superclusters are involved in the biosynthesis of more than one SM, while other genes only take part in the biogenesis of one particular SM (28, 30). This mosaic nature of superclusters makes bioinformatic prediction of gene functions problematic, but coupled with functional analysis, it will help to illuminate the evolutionary paths that fungal SM biosynthesis has traveled.", "Secondary metabolite natural products are often produced as allelochemicals, and as such, their production is often triggered by interactions of the producer with other microorganisms or plant and animal hosts (25). Cocultivation of microorganisms has also been applied in the laboratory to elicit the biosynthesis of novel SMs or to promote the production of known SMs (31). Our reassessment of monasones as genuine SMs with ecological roles independent of those of MonAzPs was prompted by the observation that cocultivation of M. ruber M7 with other microorganisms stimulates the production of these naphthoquinones but not that of the azaphilones (Tables S3 and S4 [19]). Together with their antibacterial and antifungal activities, these results suggest that the biosynthesis of monasones is an ecological fitness trait that helps M. ruber M7 defend its niche (32). At the same time, production of monasones may be further promoted by optimizing cocultivation parameters by varying the microbial challengers and the interaction modes.", "Understanding the mechanisms by which microorganisms that produce antimicrobial agents avoid suicide is crucial for developing new anti-infective drugs that are less susceptible to, and less prone to provoke, resistance in targeted pathogens and nontarget microorganisms of the host microbiome (33, 34). Resistance to antimicrobial agents may involve exclusion or inactivation of the compound, alteration of the target, and phenotypic resistance. Inactivation of toxic (naphtho)quinones by reductases or dehydrogenases has been reported in some microorganisms (22, 35). Our results show that the monasone producer M. ruber M7 may apply two-tiered self-defense by using the naphthoquinone-specific and naphthoquinone-inducible transporter MrPigP to expel monasones A and B from the mycelia and may utilize MrPigH and MrPigC to reduce residual intracellular monasones to compounds 12 and 16 that show no notable antimicrobial activity (Fig.\u00a05).", "Conclusions.", "Our work provides an example for the existence of mosaic-like superclusters in fungi. These superclusters are responsible for the biosynthesis of more than one SM with highly divergent structures and encode regulators, resistance determinants, and biosynthetic enzymes that may be shared by the constituent pathways or may be relevant only for an individual pathway. Common core enzymes encoded by these superclusters may yield malleable pluripotent intermediates that are further processed by promiscuous tailoring enzymes into structurally and functionally distinct products. Such SM biosynthetic and genomic parsimony provides important clues for the evolution of SM diversity in microorganisms. Functional characterization of the MABGC supercluster also delineates a two-tiered resistance mechanism against naphthoquinones that may transfer to pathogenic microorganisms or emerge in targeted mammalian cells."]
