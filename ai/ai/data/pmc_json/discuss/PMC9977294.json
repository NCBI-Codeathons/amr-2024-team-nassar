["Discussion", "Since plants often produce antifungal secondary metabolites, a specific compound in the host plant may define the interaction between that plants and parasitic fungi (Pusztahelyi et al., 2015). The antifungal activity of rocaglates may protect Aglaia plants from phytopathogenic fungi (Figure 5, top and middle). Rocaglate may suppress protein synthesis from survival-essential genes such as translation machinery. To survive the presence of rocaglate, which targets the general translation initiation factor eIF4A, this plant adapts eIF4A through specific amino acid substitutions (Phe163Leu-Ile199Met: hereafter, we use the human position to specify amino acid residues) to evade the toxicity of the compounds (Iwasaki et al., 2019). This study showed that the parasitic fungus Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1, which possibly originates from Ophiocordyceps spp. with an endophytic life stage, on Aglaia could also overcome this barrier by introducing an amino acid conversion (Phe163Gly) in eIF4A (Figure 5, bottom). Our results highlighted a tug-of-war between host plants and parasitic fungi through the production of translation inhibitory compounds and mutagenization in the target translation factor.", "The molecular basis of secondary metabolite resistance in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 is markedly distinct from the known strategies developed in other fungi. Avenacin from oats \u2014 an example of a plant-secreted antimicrobial substance (Morrissey and Osbourn, 1999) \u2014 is a triterpenoid that forms complexes with sterols in fungal cell membranes, causes a loss of membrane integrity, and thus exerts an antifungal effect (Armah et al., 1999; Osbourn et al., 1994). To counteract this compound and infect oats, the phytopathogenic fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. avenae (Gga) secretes avenaciase (Crombie et al., 1986; Osbourn et al., 1995), a \u03b2-glycosyl hydrolase that hydrolyzes terminal D-glucose in the sugar chain of avenacin. Indeed, avenacin degradation by this enzyme determines the host range of the fungus (Bowyer et al., 1995). In contrast to the detoxification strategy, Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 may cope with rocaglates through desensitization of the target protein eIF4A by an amino acid substitution (Figure 2), leaving the compound intact.", "The different resistance mechanisms to toxic small molecules should be highly related to the compound targets. Since sterols targeted by avenacin are biosynthesized via complicated multiple steps with diverse enzymes, thus generating diverse sterol structures, the conversion of target sterols to evade avenacin requires many enzyme modifications and occurs only rarely. On the other hand, the target of rocaglates is an eIF4A protein (and a DDX3 protein, see below for details), and thus, evasion by a single amino acid mutation is relatively likely. These results exemplify the mechanistic diversity of attack and counterattack during plant\u2013fungal pathogen interactions.", "Although we observed that Gly163 in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A produced a substantial change in sensitivity to rocaglate, the resistance may not be as complete as that obtained by the substitution found in Aglaia Phe163Leu (Iwasaki et al., 2019). Additionally, the translation factor DDX3, which was recently found to be an alternative target of rocaglate (Chen et al., 2021), did not have amino acid substitutions in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A), whereas Aglaia DDX3s harbor a substitution at Gln360 (Chen et al., 2021). This may indicate that Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 is still in the process of evolving fitness for growth in Aglaia plants. Alternatively, the rocaglate-resistant amino acid conversions may involve a trade-off with the basal translation activity. Even with the inefficiency in translation, given that other fungi could not use the resources from the plant, this substitution may still be beneficial to fungi because of the lack of competition from other fungal species. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive."]
