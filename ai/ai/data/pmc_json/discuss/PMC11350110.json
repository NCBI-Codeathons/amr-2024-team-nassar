["Discussion", "We assessed the distribution of 12 known Pantoea antibiotic BGCs across public databases, and found that some clusters, namely pantocin B, PNP-3, and PNP-4 were found only in a relatively small subset of Pantoea strains. All other clusters had more broad distributions, encompassing members of Pantoea as well as other genera in the Enterobacteriaceae, Pectobacteriaceae, Yersiniaceae, Morganellaceae, and Hafniaceae. The andrimid and PNP-5 clusters also had representatives in the Vibrionaceae. In general, the andrimid, dapdiamide, pantocin A, PNP-1, and PNP-2 BGCs were more represented across Pantoea genomes than in any other genus, while the reverse was true for the AGA and PNP-5 BGCs (Table 2). This could suggest that the metabolites encoded by BGCs that are more prevalent across a diversity of Pantoea strains play a more central role in the general ecology of the group. Secondary metabolite BGCs are often reported to be reflective of ecotype or phylotype, with many gene clusters being species-specific (Jensen et al., 2007; Penn et al., 2009; Soucy et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2019). Still, inter-species and even inter-kingdom horizontal transfer of BGCs can occur (Vior et al., 2018; Kominek et al., 2019).", "Our results are consistent with previous reports that many strains carry more than one BGC. P. agglomerans Pa31-3, Pa39-3, and Pa39-1 possess the BGCs for both pantocin A and PNP-3, P. agglomerans DAPP-PG734 has the BGCs for dapdiamide and PNP-4, and P. agglomerans strain 4 has the BGCs for dapdiamide, PNP-2 and PNP-3 (Sulja et al., 2022). Our previous work reported that P. agglomerans TX10 had clusters for both PNP-2 and pantocin A (Robinson et al., 2020) while P. agglomerans 3581 had the pantocin A cluster in addition to the PNP-3 cluster (Williams and Stavrinides, 2020). Our analysis also supported previous reports that P. vagans C9-1 has the BGCs for pantocin A, dapdiamide, and PNP-3 (Smits et al., 2011; Williams and Stavrinides, 2020; Sulja et al., 2022) and P. agglomerans Eh318 has the BGCs for pantocin A and B (Wright et al., 2001). In addition to these examples, we found several other strains that carry multiple BGCs. P. agglomerans CFSAN047153 and CFSAN047154 as well as Pectobacterium sp. F1-1 have both the AGA and PNP-2 clusters while P. agglomerans 39\u201323 and 39\u20137 have the AGA and PNP-3 clusters. P. agglomerans 540Y has both the Pantocin A and PNP-3 clusters, P. agglomerans Sl1_M5 has the dapdiamide and PNP-2 clusters, and P. agglomerans 9Rz4 has both the PNP-3 cluster as well as the herbicolin cluster. P. agglomerans VRA_MhP_f has both the PNP-2 and PNP-3 clusters. Pectobacteriaceae bacterium CE90 also contains two clusters: pantocin A and PNP-1. While our survey provides a glimpse into the distribution of these BGCs across strains, whether all these gene clusters are expressed and produce a bioactive metabolite remains unclear.", "Our survey only focused on BGCs that shared significant sequence identity to the original reference cluster. For example, the PNP-1 cluster as described in P. ananatis BRT175 is composed of eight genes and produces 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine, whereas the gene cluster in P. fluorescens that produces 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine is composed of 11 genes (Walterson et al., 2014; Okrent et al., 2018). Experimental validation was needed to establish that these two BGCs produce a similar metabolite; consequently, we opted to use more stringent criteria and thresholds for this analysis. Expanding the survey to include other BGCs that share most or all of the genes of the reference BGCs would provide unique insight into the step-wise evolution of these BGCs.", "Given the roles of natural product BGCs in competition and niche-specific adaptation, they are often found associated with mobile genetic elements (Ziemert et al., 2014; Vior et al., 2018). Potential horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events can be identified by comparing the evolutionary history of the BGCs to that of the host strains, with congruence indicating vertical transmission (Matter et al., 2009; Ziemert et al., 2014). For our analysis we used the barcoding gene cpn60, which can efficiently establish phylogenetic relationships between bacteria at the species level (Verbeke et al., 2011). We also constructed phylogenies using entire antimicrobial gene clusters, which helps to offset any strong phylogenetic signal from individual genes that may be evolving at different rates (Ziemert et al., 2014). Several instances of potential HGT were seen when comparing these trees to their sister cpn60 trees. For example, in the dapdiamide cluster tree, P. agglomerans DAPP-PG734 did not group with other P. agglomerans strains as seen in the cpn60 tree (Supplementary Figures 3A,B), suggesting the cluster has a unique evolutionary history in comparison to host strain. Analysis of the flanking regions of P. agglomerans DAPP-PG734 supports evolution through horizontal transfer, as it does not share homologous genes with any other Pantoea representatives (Supplementary Figure 3C). The flanking regions of the cluster in DAPP-PG734 also contain remnants of transposase genes, which are often associated with HGT events. In addition, the dapdiamide clusters found in P. vagans C9-1 and P. agglomerans C410P1, DAPP-PG734 and Sl1_M5 are predicted to be plasmid-encoded, and in some cases are adjacent to plasmid-associated genes such as the conjugation-associated gene, traI (Supplementary Figure 3C; dark blue arrow). The association of BGCs with mobile genetic elements can also be seen in strains carrying the andrimid, pantocin A, PNP-2, PNP-3, and PNP-4 clusters.", "Although only some BGCs were directly associated with mobile genetic elements, our %GC analysis indicated that most BGCs have 5\u201320% lower %GC relative to their parent genome or plasmid, with the exception of herbicolin BGC, which has a %GC approximately 5% higher than the genome (Table 3). The herbicolin cluster is found in Candidatus F. symbiotica 5D, a symbiont of pea aphids (Patel et al., 2019), many of which provide their hosts with antifungal defenses (\u0141ukasik et al., 2013). Given the narrow distribution of this cluster, it is interesting that these two relatively distant species share this cluster. As previously suggested, HGT may have occurred between Pantoea and Candidatus F. symbiotica (Xu et al., 2022), which is the most parsimonious explanation given the current data. Similarly, HGT may account for the PNP-1 cluster being common to both Pantoea and the unknown Pectobacteriaceae strain, as no other closely related strains have been identified that carry the cluster.", "Our survey provides a comprehensive assessment of the distribution and potential evolutionary histories of known Pantoea antibiotic BGCs to date. We show these clusters have very different distributions, ranging from more restricted to broadly distributed across distantly related families. Some of these distributions, coupled with the presence of mobile genetic elements and analyses of %GC are suggestive of HGT. An understanding of the roles of the metabolites produced by these BGCs will provide much needed insight into the ecology and evolution of Pantoea and other closely related taxa."]
