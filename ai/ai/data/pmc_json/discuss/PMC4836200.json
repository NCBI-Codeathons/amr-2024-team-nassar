["Discussion", "Biased codon usage is known to regulate gene expression and influence cell physiology in bacteria (Quax et al., 2015), but its role in antibiotic production by Gram-negative bacteria remains obscure. In this work, we showed that synonymous modification of codons had a significant effect on pyoluteorin production by the soil bacterium P. protegens Pf-5. Our study focused on AGA, the rarest codon used by Pf-5, and PltR, a transcriptional activator of genes for the biosynthesis of the antibiotic pyoluteorin. Substitution of AGA with a common synonymous codon in pltR significantly enhanced pyoluteorin production and the promoter activity of a pyoluteorin gene (pltL) that is positively regulated by PltR (Figure 3). Also, overexpression of the gene PFL_3991 encoding the cognate tRNAUCUArg significantly increased pyoluteorin production by P. protegens (Figure 4). Taken together, these results support our hypothesis that the rare codon AGA regulates pyoluteorin production in Pf-5.", "Of the six codon-modified variants of pltR constructed in this study, the variant in LK298, in which 35 types of rare codons were substituted with preferred synonymous codons, conferred much higher pyoluteorin production and pltL promoter activity than the other five pltR variants, which had fewer substitutions (Figure 3). Possible explanations for the vastly different fold change in antibiotic production and promoter activity between LK298 and other codon-modified strains include the following. (1) There could be a combined influence of the 35 types of rare codons that were substituted in LK298, only a subset of which were substituted in each of the other five strains. In support of this idea, each of the five mutants with one to six substitutions of rare codons exhibited significantly enhanced pyoluteorin production relative to wild-type Pf-5. Therefore, we were not able to eliminate any of the rare codons in pltR as irrelevant to pyoluteorin production by this approach, leaving open the possibility that many or all of the rare codons influence production of the antibiotic. While the influence of some rare codons may have been small, the combined influence was substantial, as seen for LK298. (2) In addition to the 23 rare codons that were completed modified in LK298 and in at least one of the five derivative strains (LK361-5), another 12 rare codons that were partially substituted in LK298 may also play a role in the regulation of pyoluteorin production. These 12 rare codons were not substituted with preferred synonymous codons in the modified pltR genes present in any of the other five derivative strains tested in this study (Table 3). Further research is needed to investigate the roles of other rare codons in the regulation of pyoluteorin production. (3) The large number of nucleotide differences between the pltR of LK298 and the pltR of Pf-5 may have altered the structure of the mRNA in a way that enhanced transcript abundance or stability or translational efficiency by a mechanism independent of codon-anticodon interactions. A synonymous codon substitution can alter the secondary structure of mRNA which then influences translation (Bartoszewski et al., 2010). Differences in pyoluteorin production and pltL promoter activity between codon-modified strains may be contributed, at least partially, by variations in mRNA structure introduced by nucleotide substitutions.", "In the pyoluteorin biosynthesis gene cluster, the AGA rare codon is present not only in pltR, but also in six other genes (Figure 2B). Among the AGA-containing genes in the cluster, pltMR are required for transcriptional activation of the pyoluteorin structural genes (Nowak-Thompson et al., 1999; Yan et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012; Yan and Loper, unpublished data), pltLBDE encode biosynthetic enzymes (Nowak-Thompson et al., 1999; Dorrestein et al., 2005), and pltZ encodes a transcriptional regulator controlling the efflux of pyoluteorin from the cell (Huang et al., 2004; Brodhagen et al., 2005). The presence of AGA rare codons in 40% of the genes (Table 2) in the pyoluteorin gene cluster suggests that the bacteria may use the regulatory function of AGA codon as a mechanism to coordinate the regulation, biosynthesis and export of pyoluteorin production. Additionally, we noticed that the AGA rare codon is present in many genes outside of the pyoluteorin gene cluster that influence pyoluteorin production by Pf-5. For example, AGA is present in genes encoding the sigma factor RpoN, which is known to regulate pyoluteorin production by P. protegens (P\u00e9chy-Tarr et al., 2005). In addition, biosynthesis of pyoluteorin requires the halogenases PltA (Dorrestein et al., 2005) and PltM (Yan and Loper, unpublished data) whose enzyme activities rely on flavin adenine dinucleotide hydroquinone (FADH2), which is produced from flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) by flavin reductase. There are seven genes encoding putative flavin reductases in the genome of Pf-5, and none of them are in the pyoluteorin gene cluster (Nowak-Thompson et al., 1999). However, two genes encoding flavin reductases, PFL_3289 and PFL_3609, have an AGA rare codon (Supplemental file 2), and their post-transcriptional regulation by the biased AGA codon usage in Pf-5 could contribute to the coordinated production of pyoluteorin. The presence of AGA codons in the pyoluteorin gene cluster and many other genes associated with pyoluteorin production suggests that the AGA codon may be involved in regulation of pyoluteorin beyond its role in pltR described herein.", "Compared with more common synonymous codons, rare codons generally are recognized by tRNAs that are at low abundance in the cell, which leads to a slower rate of translation (Ikemura, 1985; Elf et al., 2003; Charles et al., 2006; Chaney and Clark, 2015). The strategy of overexpressing the cognate tRNA has been used to increase translation of mRNAs with rare codons, thereby overcoming biased cognate codon usage in bacteria (Baca and Hol, 2000). In this work, overexpression of tRNAUCUArg increased pyoluteorin production (Figure 4), which provided a second line of evidence that biased codon usage of AGA regulates pyoluteorin production of Pf-5. The overexpression of tRNAUCUArg may enhance pyoluteorin production directly through elevated expression of plt genes (pltMRBDEZ) that contain at least one AGA rare codon (Figure 2B), or indirectly by increasing the expression of AGA-containing genes outside of the plt gene cluster that are involved in regulation of pyoluteorin production. Future investigation will be needed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of overexpression of tRNAUCUArg on the altered pyoluteorin production of Pf-5.", "Our finding that biased AGA codon usage of pltR regulates pyoluteorin production of Pf-5 is consistent with the known role of biased codon usage of UUA in antibiotic production by Streptomyces spp., but also highlights distinctions between the phenomena in these bacteria. Approximately 2% of the genes in the genomes of Streptomyces spp. have the UUA codon (Li et al., 2007) whereas ca. 15% of the genes in the Pf-5 genome have the AGA codon (Table 2). In S. coelicolor, nine genes, which comprise 6.2% of the 145 UUA-containing genes in the genome, are involved in the antibiotic biosynthesis (Bentley et al., 2002; Li et al., 2007). In contrast, 24 genes, which comprise only 2.6% of the 917 AGA-containing genes of Pf-5, are involved in the biosynthesis of known antibiotics (Table 2). Other AGA-containing genes have diverse predicted cellular functions, including motility, polysaccharide synthesis, stress response, type II and VI secretion systems (Figure 6, Supplemental file 2). Therefore, the AGA rare codon may play a more general role in the physiology of Pf-5 compared to the relatively focused function of the UUA codon in antibiotic production and development in Streptomyces spp. In line with that prediction, mutations in bldA, which encodes the only tRNA for the UUA codon of Streptomyces spp. (Lawlor et al., 1987), can be selected for and the mutant can persist in laboratory cultures. In contrast, our efforts to delete the tRNAArg encoding gene PFL_3991 from the chromosome of Pf-5 were unsuccessful, possibly due to an essential role of this tRNA in the bacterium. Additionally, the influence of UUA codon on antibiotic production by Streptomyces spp. is primarily through pathway-specific transcriptional regulators encoded by genes containing the UUA codon (Chater and Chandra, 2008). In contrast, the AGA rare codon is present not only in the pathway-specific regulator pltR, but also in the structural and export genes in the plt gene clusters as well as genes dispersed in the Pf-5 genome that are associated with pyoluteorin production (Figure 2). Thus, biased codon usage has a role in the antibiotic production in both P. protegens and Streptomyces spp., but these two known examples of codon usage for regulation of antibiotic production have important differences.", "In this work, we focused on the AGA rare codons of pltR and their roles in pyoluteorin production but our bioinformatic screening suggests that rare codons are likely to influence the production of many antibiotics in Pf-5. AGA is present in biosynthesis gene clusters for toxoflavin, orfamide, rhizoxin, pyrrolnitrin and DAPG, in addition to pyoluteorin (Figure 1, Table 2). For example, rzxB, the first gene of the rhizoxin gene cluster, has seven AGA codons. Additionally, both prnA and prnD, the first and last genes in the pyrrolnitrin gene cluster, have an AGA codon. It would be interesting to investigate the potential role of codon usage in pyrrolnitrin production, as the pyrrolnitrin gene cluster lacks a pathway-specific regulator and little is known about factors controlling production of this antibiotic. In addition to the codon AGA, other rare codons may also play a role in the regulation of antibiotic production by Pf-5. For example, codon UUA, with a usage frequency of 0.8 per 1000 codons in the genome, is the second rarest codon in Pf-5 but is present in pltR, phlF and toxR, which encode pathway-specific regulators for the production of pyoluteorin, DAPG and toxoflavin, respectively (Nowak-Thompson et al., 1994, 1999; Philmus et al., 2015). The UUA codon was modified to synonymous optimal codons in LK298 and LK364 (Table 3), which have a higher production of pyoluteorin and pltL promoter activity than does the wild-type (Figure 3B). Investigations into the regulatory roles of rare codons on antibiotic production by Pf-5 will improve our understanding of codon usage mechanisms and the regulation of bacterial antibiotic production.", "Codon usage provides a key mechanism by which microorganisms respond to environmental perturbations (Ling et al., 2015). An example is provided by a recent codon usage analysis in E. coli, which showed that rare codons in the yellow fluorescent protein (yfp) gene have no obvious impact on the protein synthesis rate in amino acid-rich media, but significantly affect the translation rate under amino acid-starvation conditions (Subramaniam et al., 2013). In the rhizosphere, bacteria like Pf-5 live in dynamic environments influenced by nutrients from root exudates, physical properties of the soil, and interactions with other microbes. The presence of large numbers of rare codons in pltR may allow Pf-5 to regulate the production of pyoluteorin, which is known to play a role in microbial interactions (Howell and Stipanovic, 1979; Brodhagen et al., 2004), over the range of fluctuating environmental conditions the bacterium encounters in its natural habitats. We also recognize that AGA and other rare codons are present not only in antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters, but also many other genes with diverse predicted functions in the genome of Pf-5. Future research on the regulatory roles of rare codons in antibiotic production and the expression of other phenotypes will further advance our knowledge of how Pseudomonas spp. coordinate diverse cellular functions with the antibiotic production."]
