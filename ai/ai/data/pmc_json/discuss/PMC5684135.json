["Discussion", "The vast distribution of GyrI-like proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggests that they are much more like evolutionarily conserved proteins rather than those acquired by horizontal gene transfer, and thus they should play beneficial roles to their hosts. In this study, we have identified a subfamily of prokaryotic GyrI-like proteins as CCHs that can hydrolyze the cyclopropyl moieties of YTM and CC-1065, and thereby confer cellular resistance against these cytotoxic cyclopropanoids. Thus, these GyrI-like proteins directly function as antibiotic resistance proteins. Moreover, in vitro binding assay confirms that GyrI-like proteins each still retain the ability to bind several structurally diverse xenobiotics (Supplementary Fig.\u00a025). Our results also provide strong support for the very recent proposal that GyrI-like proteins have potential multidrug resistance functions26. Structural studies of BmrR for drug binding and multispecificity reveal that aromatic side chains lining the drug pocket form a rigid, aromatic platform for diverse drugs to dock18. Subsequent structural comparison of lin2189, BmrR, SbmC, and Rob revealed that they each possess a different solvent-accessible cage formed by a set of aromatic and hydrophobic residues, which might in turn determine the ligand specificity of GyrI-like proteins (Supplementary Figs\u00a026 and 27). Therefore, it can be concluded that GyrI-like proteins may be regarded as an intracellular scavenger for xenobiotics, and that organisms harness GyrI-like proteins for cellular protection as an ancient strategy.", "Currently, antibiotic resistance is one of the major global concerns. Studies on antibiotic resistance genes located within their biosynthetic gene clusters will facilitate our understanding about the antibiotic resistome in the environment. Therefore, in addition to shedding new light on the vast capacity of organisms to deal with various toxic xenobiotics, our findings are very promising for future rational drug discovery."]
