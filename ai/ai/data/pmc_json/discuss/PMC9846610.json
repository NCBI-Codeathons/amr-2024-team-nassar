["Discussion", "Advantages of non-destructive testing in the field", "In 2019, Cook published a paper in which a lodging resistance tester, Darling, was developed. Darling was the first instrument for the lodging resistance measurement of crops in the field. The Darling tester produces a thrust at a fixed height to assess the lodging resistance of maize and sorghum, but actually evaluates the strength and toughness of the plant stalk. The Darling uses a destructive test for maximum lodging resistance.", "The purpose of our test is to assess the lodging resistance of plants in a non-destructive way, which is important for the selection of commercial cultivars and cultivation of crops. For the lack of appropriate tools and test methods, the maximum lodging resistance of plants was determined and used to evaluate the maize lodging resistance, which is based on the stalk-breaking of plants and tensile strength from different angles, and inevitably causes the breaking of plants, resulting in maize plants that could not grow normally after the test. In order to evaluate maize lodging resistance in maize without injuring the plant, the maize stalk breaking rate and tensile value at different angles were determined. F\n45 gave an index of maize lodging resistance with a very low breaking rate, and from the correspondence between F\nmax and F\n45 (\nFigure\u00a05E\n), the lodging resistance of plant was determined with F\n45. It is concluded that F\n45 can represent maize lodging resistance, which can be obtained by an NDT method in the fields. In this study, the F\n45 values were determined by a lodging resistance tester in the field and the lodging resistance of plants was calculated to predict the maximum lodging resistance, which achieved the in situ non-destructive testing of lodging resistance in maize.", "Accuracy of non-destructive evaluation of maize lodging resistance in the field", "This field non-destructive testing method can evaluate lodging resistance under different conditions. In 2018 and 2020, six varieties were selected to experiment on different densities, and the results show (1) among the varieties there existed significant differences in lodging resistance (DH661 > DH618 > DH605 > DH3622 > ZD958 > XY 335 > XD 20 > XD18); (2) the lodging resistances of plants from one variety were determined by differences in planting density, and higher planting density led to lower lodging resistance in all varieties; and (3) when the plants of one variety were tested for lodging resistance in different developmental periods, conclusions were usually consistent.", "Reliability of the non-destructive in situ lodging resistance tester method in the field", "At present the determination of maize lodging resistance usually uses the three-point bending method or the moving wind tunnel method. There are multiple instruments for the three-point bending method evaluation; the most popular tester is the YYD-1 lodging resistance tester produced by Zhejiang Topu Yunnong Technology Co., Ltd. With this instrument, DH661 (Ren et\u00a0al., 2016) and DH618 showed strong lodging resistance (Ren et\u00a0al., 2016; Gu et\u00a0al., 2017; Yang et\u00a0al., 2022), and XY335, ZD958, and XD20 showed weaker lodging resistance (Gu et\u00a0al., 2017; Xue et\u00a0al., 2020; Yang et\u00a0al., 2022). By using digital detector FGJ-5, the stem breaking resistance of different varieties of maize was rated as XY335 > ZD958 > XD20, and the bending resistance of plant was ZD958 > XD20 (Cheng, 2010). By using a mobile wind tunnel to detect lodging resistance, Wen rated the wind resistance performance of different varieties as XY335 > ZD958 > XD20 (Wen et\u00a0al., 2019). The results from non-destructive testing used in this study were nearly identical."]
