["DISCUSSION", "The structures of the complexes of 16-membered ring macrolides myc I, II\u00a0and IV with the large ribosomal subunit indicate that the antibiotics bind to the known macrolide binding site. These three mycinamicin derivatives bind the ribosome in a similar orientation and their superposition indicates that the C12\u2013C14 macrolactone substituents are of minor importance for the interactions of the drug with the ribosome (Figure 2G) since this moiety is facing the tunnel void. However, these atoms may be important for the modes of their specific antibiotic action as they may interact with the nascent chain in a differential manner.", "Inspecting the view of the tunnel from its interior towards the PTC (Figure 5A\u2013E), as well as the view from the PTC toward\u00a0the tunnel (Figure 5F\u2013J), show that the mycs narrow the tunnel as opposed to causing a complete block. However, despite this binding mode, the potency of these compounds as antibacterial agents is reflected by their MIC values (Table 1). Furthermore, to confirm the similarity of the binding location and orientation of the mycinamicins to the S. aureus ribosome and for supporting our claims about the potential of these compounds for clinical development against SA infections, we used single particle cryo-EM for studying the complex structure of the SA ribosome with myc I (to be published). Thus, the 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution structure of the SA50S-myc I complex was superimposed on the D50S-myc I structure and indicates that the antibiotic binds the SA ribosome in a highly similar location and orientation to the DR ribosome (Supplementary Figure S4A).", "The MIC assays indicated that among these three antibiotics, myc I, which includes a C12\u2014C13 epoxide moiety (but lacks the C14 hydroxyl group of myc II and myc V) is the most active compound (Table 1). Further studies are required to determine whether other substituents or chemical modifications can improve the pharmacokinetics qualities and in vivo potency of these compounds. Furthermore, the MIC assays of various SA strains and some ery-resistant strains (Table 1), indicate that the compounds are active in vivo and may overcome specific SA resistance mechanisms including ermA and ermC. Thus, 16-membered ring macrolides bearing mycinose and desosamine sugar (as opposed to cladinose and desosamine in ery) can potentially become a prototype for the next generation of this class of antibiotics.", "The focus of these structural studies was to decipher the inhibitory mechanism of mycs I, II and IV, and highlight their interactions with 23S rRNA domain II nucleotides (Figure 3A), in addition to the typical macrolide structural interactions in the NPET at the 23S domain V nucleotides (Figure 3A). We hypothesize that although resistance may be inevitable in the long-term, additional interactions of the antibiotic drugs at the NPET might delay emergence and attenuate resistance, compared to methylation of nucleotide A2058 at the NPET.", "Furthermore, our current study provides new insights regarding the mode of 16-membered ring macrolide binding to its prokaryotic biological target. The superposition of the D50S-myc I structure with the previously available structures of 16-membered ring macrolides bound to H. marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit (H50S) (PDBIDs 1K9M, 1K8A\u00a0and 1KD1), indicates that tylosin, carbomycin and spiramycin (Figure 4A\u2013C) bind in a similar orientation despite the fact that the identity of nucleotide 2058 in archea is G, which should preclude their binding. Thus, the available complex structures reveal that H50S-tylosin, H50S-carbomycin and H50S-spiramycin include a steric clash between the macrolide's mycaminose sugar moiety and the G2058 nucleotide residue. Tylosin, carbomycin, and spiramycin share an identical disaccharide, composed of mycaminose and mycarose at C5 (Figure 4), which is pointing toward the PTC and narrows the upper rim of the tunnel. Tylosin shares a mycinose sugar moiety with the mycinamycins and it also interacts with domain II rRNA nucleotides (52). By contrast, 16-membered ring macrolides spiramycin and carbomycin do not interact with domain II of the rRNA nucleotides due to the lack of an additional sugar substituent oriented in this direction. Furthermore, in comparison to these 16-membered ring macrolides where tylosin, carbomycin and spiramycin form a covalent imine bond with their C6 aldehyde moiety and the rRNA A2062 nucleotide, a key hydrogen bond interaction with the myc I and the rRNA A2062 nucleotide is formed.", "Figure 4.(A\u2013C) A superposition of D50S-myc I (yellow) on the 16-membered ring macrolides bound to the H. marismortui large ribosomal subunit, the orange arrow directs the PTC; (A) tylosin (green), (B) carbomycin (pink) and (C) spiramycin (blue).

On the other hand, SA resistance to tylosin, which has been employed for decades as an animal health product (e.g. antibiotic and growth promotion), is primarily ermB (53). Additional known synergistically acting tylosin self-resistance genes from the producing organism Streptomyces fradiae (54), tlrA, tlrB, tlrC\u00a0and tlrD confer A2058 and G748 methylation (16). The mobilization of these genes could result in cross-over mycinamycin resistance, thus limiting its long-term clinical efficacy if tylosin is persistently used in veterinary medicine (55). Fortunately, various recent studies suggest how the potential cross-over resistance burden may be deliberately managed and reduced (56,57).", "The screen of MSSA and MRSA clinical isolates demonstrated the potential of these compounds as antibacterial agents. In these MICs assays, using 20 ery-resistant MSSA and MRSA isolates, 12 strains were mycs susceptible. The t008 strains that are pvl positive belong to the pandemic USA300 lineage which is a major cause of skin infection outbreaks globally (strains SA10600, SA10670). The t002 strain that is pvl positive is a common lineage in the Bedouin population in southern Israel (strain SA10595). It is interesting to note that both of these lineages are ery-resistant azi-resistant and myc-susceptible.", "PCR identified a single resistance mechanism that the mycs cannot overcome, namely the structural changes in position A2058 in the ribosomal NPET. This was rationalized by modeling the outcome of various common resistance mechanisms on the mycs-ribosome complex structures. A2058 N6 dimethylation (58) (Figure 4D), as well as a single mutation in position A2058 may cause a steric clash between the desosamine sugar of the drug and the modified nucleotide (similar to the H50S and 16-membered ring macrolides shown in Figure 4). It has been shown that tylosin (a 16-membered ring macrolide) escapes this steric clash due to its slightly different ribosome binding orientation compared to erythromycin (59), where the C6 aldehyde appears to be located ideally to form a covalent imine bond with A2062 (Figure 4A\u2013C). The formation of this covalent bond with A2062 is unique to tylosin, carbomycin and spiramycin 16-membered lactone ring macrolides due to their size and their common C6 aldehyde moiety, which is lacking in the 14-membered macrolide antibiotics. A double mutation A2058G and A2062U resulted in a higher level of drug resistance towards 16-membered macrolides in M. smegmatis (59), which underscores the significance of the macrolide A2062 interaction. In this respect, the mycinamycins are also interacting with A2062, via a hydrogen bond, but do not escape resistance due to A2058 modifications. Nevertheless, the clinical use of 14-membered ring macrolides as a treatment against bacterial pathogens having MLSBi resistance triggers the erm genes and severely limits the use of lincosamides and streptogramins B (60). Using PCR, we identified other myc I, II\u00a0and IV-susceptible ery-resistance strains with resistance mechanisms that do not involve ermA and ermC, and further investigation is needed to determine their molecular mechanisms.", "Our studies on various S. aureus MLSBi bacterial pathogens demonstrates that the major advantage of mycs includes their inability to induce erm expression. Therefore, our results combined with the current ability to generate new 16-membered macrolides by chemoenzymatic approaches (26) provides a promising path for future discovery and clinical development of this underexplored class of therapeutics for fighting MLSBi resistance in human bacterial pathogens."]
