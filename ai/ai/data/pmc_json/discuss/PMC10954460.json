["Discussion", "Thiolutin is a well-known transcription inhibitor that has been used in mRNA stability studies, but its mode of inhibition has been complicated and unresolved. It has been demonstrated that reduced thiolutin and the related natural product holomycin chelate Zn2+in vitro, and thiolutin chelation of Zn2+ could specifically inhibit diverse classes of metalloproteins (11,12). However, these previous reports failed to observe direct thiolutin inhibition of RNAPs, under conditions where Zn2+ chelation was permissible. Here we present three independent genetic screens for thiolutin resistant or sensitive mutants, providing a genetic basis for understanding thiolutin-altered cellular responses and reveal a direct mode of action against Pol II in vivo. We show that alterations in diverse cellular pathways can modulate cellular sensitivity to thiolutin. In light of our genetic results, we discovered that both reductant DTT and Mn2+ together activate thiolutin for direct inhibition of Pol II function, countering the recent narrative while confirming classic observations (11,20).", "Thiolutin inhibits Pol II through a novel mode of action", "We propose that Thio/Mn2+ inhibits Pol II through a novel mode of action. The critical order of treating Pol II with thiolutin prior to template DNA binding is a stereotypical behavior for RNAP clamp inhibitors (23,24,101\u2013104), which are distinct from inhibitors targeting the active site, NTP uptake, or RNA exit channels. In addition, we show that thiolutin inhibits Pol II elongation on an initiation-bypassing transcription bubble template, distinct from all the three characterized E. coli RNAP inhibitors that lock the clamp in the closed state (Myxopronin (Myx), Corallopyronin (Cor)\u00a0and Ripostatin (Rip)) that do not inhibit RNAP elongation (23,105). It should be noted that Lipiarmycin (Lpm), an inhibitor that appears to lock the clamp in the partially or fully open state (24), has never been tested on a bubble template. Therefore, thiolutin behaves differently from Myx, Cor and Rip, but further experiments are in need to test whether thiolutin behaves similarly to Lpm. Finally, the exact thiolutin binding site on Pol II remains unclear, and our data cannot rule out the possibility that thiolutin may inhibit Pol II regions other than clamp-controlling switch regions.", "Diverse cellular pathways modulate thiolutin multiple modes of action", "Our genetic screens reveal the contribution of diverse cellular pathways in thiolutin sensitivity. Many of these pathways can be reconciled in a unified model based on current understanding of thiolutin's modes of action. In the cell, the thiolutin intra-molecular disulfide bond appears to be reduced, and we propose thioredoxins Trx1 and Trx2 directly or indirectly contribute to thiolutin reduction (along with glutathione) or are responsive to thiolutin oxidation of other proteins, thereby promoting thioredoxin oxidation. Reduced thiolutin subsequently chelates Zn2+ to inhibit multiple metalloproteins (e.g. Rpn11 and conferring block to proteasomal degradation of substrates), affects Zn2+ homeostasis, interacts with Mn2+ to inhibit Pol II transcription (and possibly Pol I and III), or become re-oxidized by molecular oxygen. Mn2+, Co2+\u00a0and Cu2+ also sensitize cells to thiolutin treatment while 1,10-pt does not, suggesting these interactions may not be caused by Zn2+ starvation. The reduction or redox cycling of thiolutin may induce the observed Yap1 nuclear localization and oxidative stresses. In addition, we have shown that reduced thiolutin may also chelate other divalent metals such as Cu2+ (but not Mg2+), but whether other thiolutin-metal complexes have additional activities remains to be further tested.", "Thiolutin should not be used as a tool for transcription inhibition in vivo", "Our work underpins the caveats for using thiolutin as a transcription inhibitor to investigate other cellular processes, as suggested by previous studies (9,11,12). As a routinely used transcription inhibitor to study mRNA stability, it was shown that thiolutin itself inhibits mRNA degradation and complicates the quantitation of mRNA half-life at higher doses (9). The rapid kinetics of Pol II occupancy changes we observe for RP genes are consistent with a potential immediate perturbation to Tor signaling. Note that a previous study only examined Tor pathway response at 10 min of thiolutin or 1,10-pt treatment, whereas our work suggests potential effects would be nearly immediate. RiBi genes are also downstream of the Tor pathway (30,97) are strongly affected for Pol II occupancy. However, most other genes of similar expression level to RiBi show similar decreases in Pol II occupancy (Figure 5E). Net decreases in occupancy are widespread (Figure 5D, E) but a small subset of genes is activated by thiolutin treatment with rapid kinetics (Supplementary Figures S12B). Activation of this subset is consistent with an immediate stress response that precedes any potentially slower, direct effects of thiolutin (11,85,106). Our observation that elongation of a long reporter gene, TEF1p::YLR454W, appears slow upon thiolutin inhibition of initiation is striking and points to effects that require careful dissection in future experiments. Our work here and prior work discussed above suggest that thiolutin is multifunctional and has pleiotropic effects.", "Thiolutin mode of action may reveal insights into Pol II pausing", "The thiolutin induced pause (and arrest) pattern in vitro appears to be highly specific and position-dependent, and it will be interesting to further investigate the pause sequence preference and its possible connection to a specific inhibited Pol II conformation. As discussed above, biochemical properties of thiolutin inhibited Pol II most closely resembles clamp inhibition by a locked non-closed state, possibly a partially or fully open state. It is tempting to hypothesize that the thiolutin-induced pause prone Pol II is linked to a specific Pol II conformation. This hypothesis is also consistent with the observations in E. coli RNAP that paused elongation complexes appear to correlate with open clamp and TL states, which can be reversed and possibly regulated by elongation factor RfaH (107,108). It has been proposed that this RfaH (a homolog of Spt5 in eukaryotes) pause suppression through the RNAP clamp may be a conserved regulatory mechanism for RNAP elongation in all domains of life (109). Further characterization of thiolutin inhibited Pol II may reveal additional insights into this process in eukaryotes."]
