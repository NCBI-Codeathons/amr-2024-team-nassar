["DISCUSSION", "In this work, we provide genomic, genetic, and metabolomic evidence that a single BGC (fev/bag) is responsible for the synthesis of both ferroverdins and bagremycins. That a single BGC is responsible for the production of several related compounds is not unusual, but several features make the case of the fev/bag BGC unique. For example, the chemical compositions of ferroverdins and bagremycins (nitroso-aromatic versus amino-aromatic compounds) are different, as are their structural organizations (trimers versus monomers), whereas these two characteristics are conserved in other BGCs producing multiple compounds. But what makes this biosynthetic pathway exceptional is that the bagremycins and p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA, the monomer of ferroverdins, are not produced under the same culture conditions. Indeed, excess iron supply is mandatory for p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA production and for its subsequent complexation to a tripartite molecule, while the bagremycins are produced under conditions of low iron levels. Thus, iron is a key molecule that determines the distinct biological activities produced by S. lunaelactis: bagremycins display antibacterial, antifungal, and antiproliferative activities, presumably in order to inhibit growth of neighboring competing bacteria and fungi and/or to control self-proliferation, while p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA production would be required (to limit iron-mediated oxidative damage) only when iron excess constitutes a main threat. The change of the amino in a nitroso group in bagremycin allows complexation with iron, which strongly suggests an evolutionary driver for this chemical diversification.", "We propose a possible biosynthetic pathway for both bagremycins and ferroverdins (Fig.\u00a08) on the basis of the deduced function of the different components of the bag/fev clusters and of the current knowledge on the biosynthetic pathway of bagremycins (22, 30, 31, 34). In addition, as biosynthesis is known to occur for two other types of amino/nitroso-aromatic compounds, namely, grixazones (gri genes) and 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzamide (nsp genes), the available information regarding these BGCs is useful to predict steps shared by the studied pathways.", "FIG\u00a08Proposed pathway for biosynthesis of bagremycin and ferroverdin.", "Proposed pathway for biosynthesis of bagremycin and ferroverdin.", "As demonstrated previously, bagremycin A is derived from precursors p-vinylphenol and 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-AHBA) (22). The p-vinylphenol precursor is generated in two steps from l-tyrosine, with the first step consisting of deamination by FevV/BagA in trans-coumaric acid and the second step being decarboxylation in p-vinylphenol by FevK (BagM) and FevL (BagN). Indeed, FevK and FevL form a UbiX-UbiD system in which UbiD is a decarboxylase that requires prenylated flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a cofactor, which is provided by the flavin prenyltransferase UbiX (35). Regarding the second precursor, 3,4-AHBA, it was demonstrated previously that it is formed from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and l-aspartic-4-semialdehyde (ASA) through two reactions catalyzed by BagB (FevI) and BagC (FevH) (30). Condensation of p-vinylphenol and 3,4-AHBA to form bagremycin A would be mediated by FevW, which shows high levels of similarity to proteins of the phenylacetate-CoA ligase family, which catalyze the condensation of two molecules by their carboxylic acid and alcohol moieties through adenylation.", "Regarding the synthesis of p-vinylphenyl-3,4-NHBA, the monomer of ferroverdin A and a major monomer of other ferroverdins, we propose that it would directly result from precursors p-vinylphenol and 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzoic acid (4,3-HNBA) (Fig.\u00a07). Direct generation of 4.3-HNBA would occur via the nitrosation of 3,4-AHBA and would be mediated by the copper-containing oxidase FevF (with FevE as chaperone). FevF is a copper-containing oxidase which is orthologous to NspF and GriF, while FevE is a copper chaperone orthologous to NspE and GriE (Table\u00a01). NspE bring two coppers to NspF, which converts 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzamide to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzamide in S. murayamaensis (32, 36). Likewise, GriE donates two coppers to GriF, which converts o-aminophenol into o-quinone imine in Streptomyces griseus (37). Since these FevF/FevE orthologous proteins mediate the oxidation of 3.4-AHBA-like substrates to generate quinone imine moieties which would be consecutively nitrosylated, we suggest that both of these enzymes are able to mediate the transformation of 3,4-AHBA to 4,3-HNBA. Condensation of 4,3-HNBA with p-vinylphenol by FevW would result in the formation of p-vinylphenyl-3-nitroso-4-hydroxybenzoate, the monomer of ferroverdins.", "Finally, in addition to the role of iron as a vital element for growth (38, 39), morphogenesis, and metabolite production (12, 39, 40), our work reveals an unprecedented complexity of natural product biosynthetic pathways where this element is also an environmental trigger able to change the pattern of natural compounds produced by a single BGC. By revealing an exception to the concept that a single BGC should produce a single type of bioactive molecules, our results also highlight the difficulty of estimating the metabolic potential of an organism on the basis of genomic information alone."]
