["4. Discussion", "MLT, a neuro-hormone in vertebrates, exhibits many hormone-like activities in plants, including regulating seed germination, root growth, circadian rhythm, and fruit ripening, and increasing tolerance to a wide range of adverse environmental factors such as UV irradiation, heavy metal pollutants, extreme temperatures, drought and microbial pathogens [44]. MLT plays a crucial role in protecting plants from oxidative damage in such stresses by improving the efficiency of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, scavenging free radicals, and increasing antioxidant enzyme activities [10]. In plants, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites can be considered a defense strategy to cope with stressful conditions. Some secondary metabolites, such as volatile terpenoids, phenolics, anthocyanins and flavonoids, can scavenge free radicals and act as nonenzymatic antioxidants against oxidative stress [45]. Recent studies demonstrated that MLT can promote the biosynthesis of such secondary metabolites under stress. The contents of flavonoids and the total phenolic compounds could be enhanced by exogenous MLT applied on apple (Malus hupehensis) after UV-B exposure [46], Hyoscyamus pusillus callus and citrus under drought [47,48], and garden thyme (Thymus daenensis) leaves under salinity stress [49]. Higher phenol, anthocyanin, and flavonoid contents were induced by MLT at 50 \u03bcM in rosemary seedlings under arsenic stress [50]. However, in this study, the production of a fungal PQ, HA in Shiraia sp. S9 was inhibited significantly by MLT. Hypocrellins are fungal PQ derivatives with no antioxidant activity but with photosensitive activity to produce ROS [24]. The first step of the biosynthesis pathway of HA is the condensation and decarboxylation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to nor-toralactone by PKS [42]. Mono catalyzes O-methylation, ring-opening, decarboxylation, and hydroxylation reactions formation, and then Omef may likely catalyze methyl groups into the HA backbone. We further confirmed that the transcriptional level of genes (PKS, Mono, ZFTF, FAD, Omef, MCO and MFS) in the putative gene clusters for HA biosynthesis were all downregulated significantly in S9 cultures after MLT treatment, resulting in the inhibition of HA contents (Figure 7). Our results provided a new mode for the indirect antioxidant action of MLT by decreasing the reactant (hypocrellin) of the photooxidative reaction for ROS generation. In addition, MLT at 100.00 \u03bcM inhibited conidiation and spore germination of Shiraia sp. S9 (Figure 1C,D). This is in agreement with the finding of the inhibition of the formation and germination of conidial spores in Fusarium graminearum by MLT and its chemical homolog 5-methoxyindole [51]. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the effect of MLT on fungal secondary metabolism.", "In our previous study [34], the light/dark shift induced the generation of ROS by up-regulating the expression levels of ROS-related genes of NADPH oxidase (NOX) and cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP). The elevated ROS generation was also confirmed in the green fluorescence of DCFH-DA stained hyphae (Figure 3A). Although MLT treatment did not change the activity of NOX, which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of molecular oxygen to form superoxide radical anions (Figure 4A), the supplementation of MLT significantly reduced the ROS (H2O2 and O2\u2212) levels in the culture under the light/dark shift (Figure 3C,D). In this study, MLT treatment induced an increase in the activities of SOD, CAT, and POD at the different stages of the mycelium culture (Figure 4B\u2013D). As enzyme SOD could efficiently catalyze the transformation of superoxide to H2O2, which in turn is detoxified into water and oxygen by CAT and POD [52], the enhanced activities of those antioxidant enzymes were responsible for attenuating ROS levels by MLT in the mycelia (Figure 3). Simultaneously, our study has shown the MLT-induced NO generation during the culture (Figure 5A\u2013C). The induced NO production in Shiraia sp. S9 was inhibited by the NOS inhibitor L-NAME and NR inhibitor STD, suggesting the involvement of an NOS-like enzyme and NR-dependent side reaction for fungal NO generation [53]. Recently MLT has also been reported to function cooperatively with NO to regulate plant growth, development and defense responses [54]. The generation of NO induced by exogenous MLT was reported to enhance cold tolerance in tomato fruits [55] and to improve tolerance to lead toxicity in maize [56]. Exogenously applied MLT increased NO levels of pepper (Capsicum annuum) and alleviated the detrimental effects of salt stress and iron deficiency [57]. NO can act as a downstream signal of MLT in plants and mitigate harmful effects of different stresses, including salinity, heavy metals, drought and osmotic stress [54]. However, there is no information in the literature on the effect of MLT-induced NO on fungal growth and metabolism. Our study is also the first report on the induced generation of NO signal in fungi by MLT. The suppression of MLT-induced O2\u2212 production by NO donor SNP (MLT + SNP vs. MLT in Figure 6B) and the increase by NO scavenger cPTIO (MLT + cPTIO vs. MLT in Figure 6B) in our study suggests an antioxidant effect of intracellular NO. In addition, the scavenger ROS by Vc could lead to enhanced NO levels during MLT treatment (MLT + Vc vs. MLT in Figure 6A). These results suggested a possible antagonistic action between NO and ROS during MLT treatment. Deng et al. (2016) reported that exogenous H2O2 at 10\u201320 mM also played positive effects on HA production of S. bambusicola [28]. Recently, we demonstrated that endogenous ROS generation was one of the early signals for the elicitation of HA production in Shiraia mycelium cultures under the ultrasound treatment [33], a light/dark shift [34] and lanthanum (La3+) [58]. Therefore, the existence of interplays between NO and ROS might have been involved in HA biosynthesis during MLT treatment. Our results showed that H2O2 or NO scavenger cPTIO could rescue MLT-induced inhibition on expressions of HA biosynthetic genes and their content (Figure 7). These findings further support the involvement of NO and ROS in HA biosynthesis during MLT treatment. In the proposed hypothetical model for MLT regulation (Figure 8), MLT, antioxidant enzymes and NO cooperate to enhance their antioxidative potentials in the cultures of Shiraia sp. S9 under a 24 h:24 h light-dark shift, leading to the suppression of ROS signals for the elicitation of HA biosynthesis and the final inhibition of HA production.", "ROS generation can be triggered by HA under irradiation and exert oxidative stress on HA-yielding fungus of S. bambusicola [28]. However, Shiraia with higher HA production can retain growth and morphology in normal and even high biomasses under visible light irradiation [34,59], indicating an excellent antioxidant system of the fungus. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) biosynthesis was proved to be vital for the resistance of Cercospora nicotianae to its own abundant ROS produced by its cercosporin, a hypocrellin-like PQ compound [60]. Antioxidants (cysteine, ascorbate and reduced glutathione) and antioxidant enzymes also enhanced the resistance of C. nicotianae to the phototoxicity of cercosporin [61]. Callahan et al. (1999) reported that a cercosporin facilitator protein (CFP) contributed self-resistance to self-produced cercosporin by actively exporting the toxin out of cells [62]. Our results suggested a new possible mechanism for Shiraia self-resistance via MLT biosynthesis to inhibit phototoxic HA compounds. The changes of endogenous MLT contents in Shiraia at different growth stages and to different environmental factors need further investigation. On the other hand, PQ phototoxins such as HA, cercosporin or elsinochrome are a pathogenicity factor for fungal infection via ROS generation, damaging the cells of host plants [25]. Photoactivated PQs are biosynthesized overwhelmingly by plant parasitic fungi, including Shiraia, Cercospora and Elsino\u0451 species, which cause economically important diseases on many important plants such as citrus, corn, and soybean as well as vegetable crops and horticultural plants [63]. Thus, it is a plausible strategy to combat these fungal diseases by suppressing the production of photoactive PQ. Shiraia spp. are pathogenic fungi parasitizing mainly on more than 10 species of bamboos [64]. In the present study, our results showed the strong adverse activity of MLT against Shiraia sp. S9 by inhibiting HA production (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Many previous investigations have demonstrated the anti-pathogenic activity of MLT in animals, e.g., reducing the deleterious effects of the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, decreasing blood and brain viruses in mice and enhancing bactericidal capacity against multidrug-resistant bacteria [65]. MLT was also reported to increase fungicide susceptibility and enhance the vulnerability of phytopathogenic fungi (Botrytis, Penicillium, Fusarium, Phytophthora and Alternaria spp.) [66]. Therefore, the combined application of MLT and other fungicides could be developed as a novel biocontrol strategy to control plant diseases caused by PQ-producing fungi."]
