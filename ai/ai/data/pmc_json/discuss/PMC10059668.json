["3. Discussion", "When considering the potential benefits of studying and discovering AMPs of EPN/EPB symbioses we must remind of the natural role of these compounds. There are several biosynthetic (NR-AMPs) produced by Xenorhabdus species. They are end-products of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) which usually use terminal reductase domains for 2-electron reduction of the enzyme-bound thioester releasing the generated peptides as C-terminal aldehydes [49]. Each EPN/EPB symbiotic association has been, existing in a given environmental milieu, as a coevolutionary product selected by/in a respective polyxenic environment (insect cadaver in the given soil). The biological role of each NR-AMP molecule is a contribution to providing pathobiom) conditions for a given symbiotic complex [32]. We can give only a short list of those NR_AMPs discovered in our Xenorhabdus bacteria so far without having information about their modes of action. Structure elucidation of natural products including the absolute configuration is a complex task that involves different analytical methods like mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and chemical derivation, which are usually performed after the isolation of the compound of interest [50]. As for X. budapestensis DSM16342T(Nov) (EMA), in our previous experiments, we found an unusual arginine-rich hexapeptide bicornutin [37] which we mistakenly believed to be the active ingredient of the CFCM of EMA species, because it has always been present in the antimicrobial-active CFCM [37]. Our results drew the attention of Professor H. Bode and his associates. Continuing our search for strong AMPs in our EMA Fuchs and his associates (2012), proved that bicornutin exerted neither bacteriostatic nor bactericide activity, however [43], but this work initiated further search partly toward this strange molecule (studying the neutral loss fragmentation-pattern-based screening for arginine-rich natural products. They extended their studies on 16 different Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus strains) and toward the substantive antibiotic component of the CFCM (the fabclavine). The bicornutin research led to the discovery of a novel group of related natural products comprising 25 different arginine-rich peptides. These molecules were identified due to their characteristic neutral loss fragmentation pattern, and the structures of eight of these compounds were elucidated. Two biosynthesis gene clusters encoding non-ribosomal peptide synthetases were also identified, emphasizing the possibility to identify a group of structurally and biosynthetically related natural products, [43]. The research was expanded by the same fellow scientists, leading to the discovery of the fabclavine [44] which seems to be the most significant AMP in the genus Xenorhabdus, and EMA and EMC proved the most efficient fabclavine-producers. Fabclavins, which were discovered in EMA and EMC seem to be the most important NR_AMP molecular family in the genus Xenorhabdus [45,46,51]. EMA and EMC seem to be the strongest fabclavine producers [35]. Surprisingly enough X. budapestensis which has been discovered in samples of Central European (Hungarian) soil has also been found in two different locations in China, and produce another type of NR-AMPs, two novel cyclic depsipeptides Xenematides F and G. but no one tested for fabclavine production this new isolate [52,53]. As for X. szentirmaii, it produces xenofuranones A and B [54], and phenazines [55], and szentiamide, [56,57].", "The coexistence of so many antimicrobial compounds with large target spectra and cooperating potential comprises a potentially promising toolkit combatting MDR because antibiotic-resistant bacteria perform a high frequency of collateral sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides, [13,16,17]. X. budapestensis (EMA) and X. szentirmaii (EMC) are abundant sources of NR-AMP molecules of large target spectra and strong anti-pathogen potential, [35].", "Each NR-AMP molecule in the Xenorhabdus CFCM is the end-product of a biosynthetic pathway. Each biosynthetic pathway is encoded by genes clustered in the respective operon (biosynthetic gene complex, BCG). In EMC 71 BCGs have been identified [58]. Their large spectral NR-AMP products of overlapping activities and cooperating potential are coexisting as ingredients of the CFCM. Theoretically, there are two alternative ways of research philosophy for the geneticist of agricultural or veterinary commitments.", "One option is to focus on searching for individual molecules as new potential drugs, benefitting the global (co)regulation of the biosynthesis of different NR_AMPs, searching for or constructing EPB strains synthesizing only single NR-AMP molecules. As for this alternative, the recent discovery, according to which the different NRPS-encoding operons are under the global control of the post-transcriptional regulator, Hfq, provides an option for constructing Xenorhabdus strains producing single NR-AMP only [41]. It is a great challenge!", "Another strategy is to try to benefit from the co-existence of naturally cooperating NR_AMP molecules in the CFCMs by producing harmless but effective preventive biopreparations like food supplements either as food supplements for veterinary, or soil additives for plant protection goals against pathogens and parasites.", "This latter option may be discussed here in light of the experiment\u2019s results where chickens were fed by XENOFOOD, a food supplement, in which in vitro active ut heat-sterilized NR-AMPs were present as ingredients. We know about these compounds that they were of peptides [28], in vitro anti-coccidial active [39], which did not lose their antimicrobial potential either when heat-sterilized [36], or when subjected to pepsin digestion [39].", "But in the in vitro experiment we presented here we found that each EPB CCM we tested exerted strong cytopathogenic effects on LMH permanent confluent chicken cells. We do not know whether one single (most probably the fabclavine) [43,44,45,46] molecule or more than one molecule can be taken as responsible for the cyto-pathogenecity. There are several candidates (see Table 5).", "It is not known whether the mechanism of the antimicrobial action of a given NR-AMP molecule is the same as those causing cytopathogenicity in the organisms.", "The XENOFOOD food supplement proved in this experiment harmless and GI active against a bacterium pathogen, Clostridium perfringens.", "However, in our in vivo feeding experiment the lower number of Clostridia does not automatically indicate a \u201cprotection\u201d exerted by the XENOFOOD, since the natural infestation rate of the experimental animals was very low, making conclusions on the preventive potential of the XENOFOOD just hypothetical, probable, but not certain. Another plausible explanation however for the strong differences between the average CFU values between the control (C) and the XENOFOOD-fed (T) group cannot be given.", "The moderate but detectable anti-Clostridial effect without any detectable harmful side effects may be explained in more ways than one. An explanation may come from the previous experiments on Eimeria (unpublished) that the effective cytotoxic concentration is much higher than the effective anti-clostridial dose.", "An alternative interpretation is that the actual local NP-AMR concentration (bioavailability) was much lower in the blood than in the GI system. Consequently, the local critical threshold cytotoxic concentration of the toxic compound(s) in other organs and tissues was not reached.", "We suppose that the two alternatives cannot exclude each other but that the second option is more plausible because the immune system of the birds must be capable of neutralizing peptide-like compounds, either the toxins or the NR-AMPs or both. The higher average weights of the bursas in the T-groups suggest that humoral immunity is mainly responsible for that.", "Perspectives are discussed in the Section 5 \u201cConclusions\u201d."]
