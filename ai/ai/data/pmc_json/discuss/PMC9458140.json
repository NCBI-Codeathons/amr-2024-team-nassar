["3. Discussion", "S. fungicidicus was reported to confer good control effects on a variety of horticultural plant fungal diseases, and its fermentation metabolites show broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity [22,23]. A previous study showed that S. fungicidicus YH9407 isolated from soil samples can produce tetraene antibiotics [24]. S. fungicidicus isolated from the sedimentary soil of the Pacific Ocean floor produces a low-toxicity, antifouling metabolite [25]. Additionally, S. fungicidicus MML1614, which produces a highly active proteolytic enzyme, was screened from the bottom sedimentary soil of the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean [23]. Enramycin, a polypeptide antibiotic produced by the metabolism of S. fungicidicus, has strong inhibitory effects on Gram-positive bacteria [26]. In this study, three cyclic dipeptide compounds were isolated from S. fungicidicus SYH3: Cyclo-(L-Phe-L-Pro), Cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Leu), Cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Ile), and a new compound: 6-( 5-hydroxy-6-methylheptyl)-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one.", "Compounds 1-3 are cyclic dipeptides formed by the condensation of two \u03b1-amino acids through peptide bonds. According to their characteristic structures, it was determined that the three compounds belong to the diketopiperazines (DKPs). Notably, DKPs have become an important pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry because of their stable six-membered ring skeleton structure, which has attracted increasing attention [27]. In recent years, a large number of active natural products with the structure of DKPs have been isolated from the bacteria, Actinomycetes, and fungi from marine sources [28,29,30]. The DKPs exhibit a variety of biological and pharmacological activities, and can be synthesized into anti-cancer, anti-tumor [31,32], anti-inflammatory analgesics, stimulants, and anti-hypertensive drugs in medicine [33]. In addition, some of the DKPs are signaling molecules of intercellular communication, which can regulate the LuxR-mediated bacterial quorum-sensing system and control the formation of biofilms by interfering with the information exchange between the microorganisms [34]. Here, the DKPs\u2019 compound1-Cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Ile), was reported to be isolated from Galactomyces geotrichum [35], Lactobacillus plantarum [36], Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas alcaligenes cell-free culture supernatants [37]. To our knowledge, such cyclic dipeptides have not been reported to be produced from S. fungicidicus. The compound 2-Cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Leu) has good antagonistic activity against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [38,39,40,41]. In particular, the effect of the compound on the spore germination and hyphal growth of Pyricularia oryzae was comparable to the inhibitory effect on A. solani in this study [42]. The compound 3-Cyclo-(L-Phe-L-Pro) is mainly derived from marine microorganisms, such as marine mollusks [43], marine-derived Bacillus cereus [44], and marine sponge Dysidea sp. [45], while it has not been shown that the compound can be produced from S. fungicidicus. Collectively, the anti-fungal effects of compound 1-3 on A. solani have not been reported, and their modes of action still require further investigation in future works.", "In addition, we isolated and identified a new compound, 6-(5-hydroxy-6-methylheptyl)-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which was effective on the spore germination and mycelial growth of A. solani. The six-membered lactone ring structure of this compound is a common core pharmacodynamic skeleton in drugs [46]. The hypolipidemic drug lovastatin and the anti-falciparum malaria drug artemisinin both contain the structural backbone of a six-membered lactone ring [47]. Therefore, we speculate that the six-membered lactone ring structure of the new compound 4 is the main active functional structure. To our knowledge, there are no reports on the resistance of six-membered lactone ring compounds on plant diseases. Therefore, to further clarify the mechanism of action of the compounds, the metabolic process and the action targets of the compounds should be investigated in any future study. In addition, whether the new compound can induce host defense responses is also an interesting topic, and a corresponding investigation should also be performed in future work.", "In this study, 15 components were obtained after resin adsorption, extraction, and silica gel column chromatography from the fermentation broth of S. funcidicus SYH3. Four compounds, including a new compound 4, were further isolated and purified from the most effective component 6 of the fermentation broth. Importantly, the new compound had a significant inhibitory effect on the germination of A. solani spores and the growth of hyphae, and its chemical structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry and one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. Nevertheless, we did not purify and investigate the potentially effective compounds from other components (e.g., components 3, 4, 5, and 15 also conferred considerable anti-fungal effects) in this study, which remain to be further elucidated in future works. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the study of the active products of S. funcidicus, demonstrating the activity of DKPs and six-membered lactone ring compounds against plant fungal diseases. A feasibility prediction analysis of hexavalent lactones as anti-fungal lead compounds is presented."]
