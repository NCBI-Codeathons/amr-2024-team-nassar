["DISCUSSION", "Bacterial multidrug ABC transporters play a vital role in bacterial physiology, controlling processes such as resistance to antimicrobial substances, virulence, and biosynthesis of bioactive natural products. Frequently, transporter inactivation leads to intracellular accumulation of the otherwise excreted metabolites (39, 40). So far, a small number of studies has documented a cessation of toxin synthesis (rather than intracellular toxin accumulation) upon inactivation of respective transporters. For example, transposon mutagenesis leading to inactivation of the ABC transporter ExiT, which forms part of the NRPS gene cluster responsible for nonribosomal synthesis of the siderophore exochelin, resulted in an exochelin-negative phenotype in Mycobacterium smegmatis (15). Similarly, we have shown that deletion of the ABC transporter CesCD, encoded in cereulide synthetase operon in emetic B. cereus (20), resulted in a cereulide-negative phenotype. This suggests that biosynthesis of this nonribosomal peptide was blocked in a hitherto-unknown manner (31). To elucidate the function of the ABC transporter CesCD in cereulide biosynthesis, we investigated if the CesCD transporter interacts with CesAB NRPS and consequently tethers this multimodular enzyme complex to the cell membrane, thereby potentially enabling the adoption of the optimal conformation for depsipeptide assembly. Such allosteric regulation could control the function of cereulide synthetase as well as efficiency of the whole assembly line in B. cereus.", "Novel type of ABC transporter-NRPS biosynthetic machinery, exemplified by Ces NRPS.", "Our data convincingly show that an ABC transporter adjacent to a nonribosomal peptide synthetase plays a crucial and direct role in the biosynthesis of a natural product, beyond its canonical transport function. The biosynthesis of cereulide, just as for other nonribosomal peptides, is a multistep, energy-consuming process. Since cereulide is an ionophore leading to membrane depolarization (41, 42), it is tempting to speculate that it would be beneficial for the producing cells to simultaneously orchestrate both the biosynthesis and the export of this metabolite. Subcellular compartmentalization of the metabolic enzymes involved in the primary metabolic processes, such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, or fatty acid synthesis, is a widespread and highly regulated process (43). In contrast, only a few examples of subcellular compartmentalization in secondary metabolism have been documented. An organelle-like, membrane-associated megacomplex of NRPS/PKS hybrid was described for B. subtilis (44). Furthermore, the temporal membrane localization of the siderophore pyoverdine NRPS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported in the context of efficient transport of the precursors and the release of the final product to the secretion apparatus (35). As revealed by our study, the ATPase CesC of the ABC transporter CesCD, which is cotranscribed with the structural cereulide synthetase genes cesAB (26), specifically interacts with the condensation domains of CesAB. We did not detect any interaction between CesC and the A domains or TE domain of CesB. Since A domains are the catalytical core of each NRPS module responsible for amino, hydroxy, and carboxy acid recognition and activation (3, 45), one could speculate, a priori, that a binding pocket will, in order to remain exposed to its substrates, not easily interact in trans. In contrast, C domains have been recognized as quite flexible NRPS domains, which can adopt several conformations (46, 47). This observation is fostered by our results, suggesting that the interactions of C domains with CesC, the catalytic part of the ABC transporter, permit CesAB to adopt the optimal conformation for efficient cereulide synthesis. We further demonstrated that CesA_C* colocalizes with CesCD at the cell membrane, while CesA_C* was found to be delocalized and distributed throughout the cytosol in cells not expressing a functional CesCD ABC transporter. As inactivation of either cesC or cesD led to loss of cereulide production (31), it is tempting to speculate that roping of the cereulide biosynthetic machinery to the cell membrane via CesCD is crucial for cereulide biosynthesis.", "Transport of the substrates by ABC transporter is a multistep process. First, nucleotide binding domains (NDBs) undergo dimerization due to the binding of ATP and the substrate. In the second step, ATP is hydrolyzed and the substrate is translocated across the membrane. However, under certain circumstances, ATP binding alone leads to the conformational changes of the transporter to facilitate substrate allocation. In the latter case, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release reset the transporter to the original conformation (48, 49). The NBDs have highly conserved amino acid sequences, such as the Walker A motif (GXXGXGKS/T) (lysine in bold) (11), which is also conserved in CesC (Fig.\u00a01B). Within the Walker A motif, the conserved amino acids lysine and glycine have been reported to play a pivotal role for the functionality of the transporter by binding to ATP (50, 51). As revealed by our current work, the Walker A motif in CesC is essential not only for correct CesCD oligomerization but also for the interaction of CesC and CesA_C*, suggesting that it plays an additional role in the NRPS assembly line of cereulide beyond its canonical function. The change of a conserved lysine to methionine (K40M) in the Walker A motif of CesC also influenced the interaction of CesC and CesA_C* and consequently ceased cereulide biosynthesis. In contrast, the cereulide biosynthesis level was only partially affected in the F48\u0394cesCDcesCD_V29T/F30Y mutant. The V29 and F30 amino acids, located directly upstream of the conserved Walker A motif, were selected for the mutagenesis because they are conserved between the B. cereus CesCD and B. thuringiensis BerAB transporters (data not shown). Furthermore, these amino acids have not yet been described to play an essential role for the functionality of ABC transporters. It could be speculated that the exchange of V29T/F30Y affects the exact position of Walker A within the structure of the ABC transporter, thereby hindering its functionality. Further structural studies, which are clearly beyond the scope of our current work, will be necessary to fully decipher the molecular interactions between CesCD and CesAB. Nevertheless, the results of the mutagenesis approach and findings from the colocalization studies emphasize that a functional ABC transporter, CesCD, is essential for the correct assembly of the enzymatic CesNRPS machinery directing cereulide biosynthesis.", "As demonstrated by BACTH, the structurally similar BerAB transporter from the non-cereulide-producing organism B. thuringiensis, interacts with the C* domain of CesA. This demonstrates a noncanonical function of ABC transporter in natural product synthesis by direct interactions with the NRPS complex. Thus, it could be hypothesized that C domains of CesAB require the interaction with CesCD, in order to adopt optimal conformation for the assembly line, while the absence of CesCD leads to the stalling of CesAB synthetase (47).", "Furthermore, heterologous expression of berAB in the \u0394cesCD mutant restored cereulide titer to the wild-type level. These data underscore the crucial role of membrane transporters in both the functionality of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and the efficiency of subsequent product assembly. Notably, among the 605 NRPS clusters annotated in the MIBiG database (38), we found 14 clusters encoding putative ABC transporters with high homology to CesC. These putative ABC transporters are found in NRPS gene clusters of different bacterial species, including species not related to the B. cereus group, such as Rothia nasimurium, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Salinispora arenicola, a Micromonospora sp., and a Streptomyces sp. (Table\u00a0S4). These findings from our in silico analysis foster the hypothesis that ABC transporters could play a crucial role in biosynthesis of natural product beyond their canonical function.", "Similarly, an interaction was reported between the MmpL7 permease belonging to the RND (resistance, nodulation, and cell division) family of bacterial transporters and the PpsE polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of the lipid phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (52). However, deletion of mmpL7 in M. tuberculosis did not alter PDIM synthesis but led to intercellular accumulation of PDIM (52), while the deletion of cesCD disabled cereulide production in emetic B. cereus (Fig.\u00a04A) (31). Thus, the interaction between the ABC transporter CesCD and CesAB synthetase is critical not only for coordination of synthesis and transport but also for the functionality of the biosynthetic complex.", "In summary, our work revealed novel insights into microbial secondary metabolite biosynthesis and provided evidence for an essential, noncanonical function of ABC transporter in natural product synthesis. These findings are expected to be of high relevance for the understanding of the architecture and cellular organization of NRPS multienzyme machinery and may provide a foundation for future work that could contribute to the discovery of novel bioactive microbial products, which are the major source of antibacterial, anti-infective, and antitumor therapeutics (53). In recent years, great advances have been made in developing tools and techniques to access bacterial and fungal natural products. However, progress has not kept up with demands from a global society that is becoming increasingly reliant on discovery of the novel therapeutics against pan-resistant microbes (54\u201356). The function of CesCD and BerAB transporters in cereulide biosynthesis reported here may represent a key, widespread mechanism in the assembly line of nonribosomal natural products. Therefore, improved understanding of ABC transporters may indeed allow exploitation of hitherto-cryptic secondary metabolite NRPS clusters (57) for which, despite successful expression of the biosynthetic genes, natural products have not yet been detected."]
