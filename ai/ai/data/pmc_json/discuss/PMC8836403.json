["3. Discussion", "Terpenoid biosynthesis gene clusters usually consist of several genes, encoding the terpene synthase for the skeleton [34] and oxidoreductases for the hydroxylation, aldehydeylation, carboxylation and dehydrogenation [3,4,35]. In the four reported ophiobolin gene clusters, terpenoid synthase, P450 oxidase and flavin-dependent oxidase jointly completed the synthesis of ophiobolins, while the distribution of these genes was irregular. In our study, we found that the flavin-dependent oxidase OblCAu was unclustered. Similarly, in another ophiobolin K-producing strain A. stellatus, this enzyme was also not in the oblAs. Additionally, even though OblCBm was located in the oblBm of B. maydes, the enzyme responsible for C14-hydroxylation to form ophiobolin A was not found [28]. It is possible that the two enzymes were also unclustered.", "Based on the above results, we assumed that OblCAu may have a substrate promiscuity. In A. ustus 094102, OblCAu could dehydrogenate intermediates generated in the multi-step oxidation process (Scheme 1), as we discovered 21,21-O-dihydro-6-epi-ophiobolin G (8) and 21-deoxyophiobolin K (9) from its products [7]. Additionally, the docking results of OblC with 1 and 3 further proved this point. In the catalytic pockets of both models, most residues, especially those near the side chains, were the same (Figure S8), which indicated that the side chain was the core site where OblC recognized substrates, and changes of groups at the rings away from the side chain had little effect on the catalytic activity of OblC. Owing to the substrate promiscuity of OblCAu and the non-enzymatic transformation of natural ophiobolins, nearly 20 ophiobolins were found in the metabolites of A. ustus 094102 [7]. FAD-dependent oxidoreductases play an important role in the modification of the terpene skeleton. It has been reported that an unclustered FAD-dependent oxidase EriM responsible for the aldehydation at C-15 in erinacines could catalyze erinacine X, erinacine (14) and erinacine Q to form erinacine ZA, erinacine T and erinacine P, respectively [36]. This discovery suggests that there may be more FAD oxidases with substrate promiscuity responsible for terpenoid biosynthesis, which provides critical clues for the discovery of more terpenoids and combinational synthesis of non-natural products.", "The compartmentalized biosynthesis of natural products in fungi is a unique mechanism of higher organisms containing organelles. Compartmentalization can restrict different enzymes and substrates to specific subcellular spaces, thereby effectively preventing non-specific reactions and the cytotoxicity of intermediates or products. The biosynthesis of mycophenolic acid derived from Penicillium brevicompactum displays a typical compartmentalization feature, because it relies on the \u03b2-oxidation metabolism process in the peroxisome to shorten the isopentenyl long chain specifically [37]. In our research, OblDAu transported ophiobolins outside of the cell membrane to realize the self-resistance of hosts against its toxic metabolites.", "Accidentally, we obtained a high-yield ophiobolin C (3) strain with 200 mg\u00b7L\u22121, which was higher than that previously reported [33]. The cytotoxicity tests showed that all three compounds 3\u20135 had a strong activity against the MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7/ADR cell lines. Additionally, compound 10 exhibited weak activity on MDA-MB-231 (Table 1). Due to 3\u20135 having no stable conjugated groups on the side chain, it is possible to introduce active groups at the end of the side chain through chemical modification [38], which is beneficial to the synthesis of ophiobolin derivatives and provides more valuable lead compounds for cancer therapy."]
