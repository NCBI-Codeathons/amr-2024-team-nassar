["3. Discussion", "The drop in effectiveness of clinically important antibiotic classes, based on rapidly spreading resistance among a variety of bacterial species, illustrates the urgent need of alternative treatments [1,49,50]. Due to a shortage in the discovery of new effective molecules, an alternative strategy deals with the optimization of already known but neglected scaffolds. For CHD, structural modifications introduced through genetic engineering led to the amidated derivative CDCHD exhibiting improved pharmaceutical properties and an extended antibacterial spectrum [15]. In this study, we confirmed the enhanced activity pattern for CDCHD within the ESKAPE pathogen panel and, additionally, its activity against tetracycline-resistant pathogens. An early report on successful CHD therapy of patients suffering from pyelonephritis [25] led us to reassess CHD as a scaffold for the development of a novel therapeutic against UTIs. Here, we consolidated the prospect of treating this infectious disease by using CHD-based novel antibacterial scaffolds. The in vitro activity of both CHD and CDCHD was demonstrated on a large panel of uropathogens from a recent clinical isolate collection, including colistin-resistant pathogens and pathogens expressing TEM-\u03b2 lactamases or extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases. The highest antibacterial potency of the compounds was observed against uropathogenic Enterobacteriaceae, which represent about 70\u201380% of all common uropathogens causing either uncomplicated or complicated UTIs [30]. The fact that both chelocardins show even better activities when MICs were determined in artificial urine furthermore underlines their potential as future UTI drugs, and MBCs were generally lower for CDCHD against most of the clinical uropathogens both in standard medium and in artificial urine, demonstrating the advanced potency of this molecule. The fact that a general loss in activity was observed against the uropathogenic isolates of P. aeruginosa compared to previously reported MICs for non-uropathogenic clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa [15] suggests that the uropathogenic strains may possess additional resistance determinants yet to be identified. However, P. aeruginosa plays a minor role in the development of different forms of UTI, sharing a fraction of 1\u20132% among epidemiologically relevant uropathogens [30]. Overall, the activity profiles of chelocardins are highly remarkable because conventional drugs used to treat UTIs, such as fluoroquinolones or \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, are affected by the increasing number of MDR uropathogens that hamper their application [51,52,53,54]. In addition, the use of fluoroquinolones including those commonly applied in UTI therapy such as ciprofloxacin has recently been restricted due to severe side effects [55,56], making the development of novel drugs for UTI treatment even more urgent.", "The potential of CDCHD as a novel antibacterial lead was further demonstrated by revealing its resistance-breaking properties, not only towards a diverse set of tetracycline-resistant determinants, but also by overcoming the efflux-based resistance induced by the parent compound CHD itself. Our studies on a set of CHD-resistant mutants showed no apparent cross-resistance to CDCHD, and several attempts to induce resistance towards CDCHD by using different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species did not lead to the development of any stable CDCHD-resistant mutant in vitro. While resistance towards CHD was found to rely mainly on the upregulation of the ubiquitous AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, the potency of CDCHD was generally not affected by this mechanism, thus indicating that CDCHD might be a weak substrate for AcrAB-mediated efflux and does not select for its deregulation (Figure 2).", "This is particularly important because therapy with newly approved tetracycline derivatives is already affected by the emergence of resistant bacteria. The semisynthetic minocycline derivative tigecycline is the first FDA-approved member of the family of glycylcyclines [59], which was initially developed to overcome resistance against classical tetracyclines [60,61]. However, cases of tigecycline-resistant bacteria have been reported for several years, which are augmented by recent studies showing that ribosome mutations and the spread of tetracycline-inactivating enzymes affect the efficacy of further third generation tetracyclines including omadacycline and eravacycline [23,62,63]. Remarkably, an important resistance mechanism for tigecycline relies on mutations of ramR and, consequently, RamA-mediated upregulation of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump [38,64,65]. Further efflux-based mechanisms of resistance towards omadacycline and eravacycline have been recently reported [66,67,68,69]. Moreover, in the case of resistance development against (fluoro)quinolones or \u03b2-lactams such as cefoxitin, mutations in ramR were shown to be the primary and most frequent cause for efflux-mediated MDR phenotypes in species such as Salmonella enterica or K. pneumoniae [35,70]. Furthermore, clinical isolates with different resistance-conferring mutations and phenotypes were often found to overexpress additional positive regulators of acrAB-tolC such as MarA and SoxS [71,72,73], which was also observed in this study. As CDCHD did not induce any of these resistance mechanisms and is not affected by them, we can conclude that this compound might eventually be more potent than currently applied antibiotics, especially for the treatment of infections caused by MDR bacteria, since resistance-breaking properties of CDCHD have also been demonstrated in a concise set of clinically relevant uropathogenic strains as discussed above. However, the compound\u2019s future development will also hinge on evaluating its potency using larger sets of MDR bacteria with a particular focus on strains that display an upregulated efflux or possess clinically relevant efflux determinants that were not yet included in recent screenings.", "Our study further showed that the only factor identified thus far to confer resistance towards both CHD and CDCHD is the ChdR exporter of the natural CHD producer A. sulphurea, which is restricted to the presence of the CHD biosynthetic gene cluster in this soil-dwelling bacterium. Altogether, CDCHD overcomes resistance mechanisms exerted not only on various tetracyclines but also on the parent molecule CHD, and the antibacterial spectrum of CDCHD and in particular its potent activity against clinical uropathogens make the compound an ideal candidate for in vivo efficacy testing. Currently, its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are investigated in mouse and rat studies including (c)UTI models with selected uropathogens, aiming to develop the lead molecule further towards a novel broad-spectrum antibiotic."]
