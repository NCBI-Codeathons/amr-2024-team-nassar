["DISCUSSION", "In this study, we determined the prevalence of lugdunin-producing S. lugdunensis strains and found that the distribution of lugdunin-producing strains was associated with SCCmec, agr, and ST genotypes. Our lugdunin screening using the agar spot test showed that not all S. lugdunensis strains produced lugdunin under the given conditions, strongly suggesting that lugdunin production may be strain specific and associated with STs or other genotypes that could affect lugdunin production and regulation. We analyzed its association with different genotypes and found that the majority of the ORSL lugdunin-producing strains belonged to ST3 and harbored the agr II genotype. This ST type was similar to that of the reference strain IVK28 used by Zipperer et al., which also belongs to ST3. The SCCmec typing of ORSL revealed that most strains (27, 56.3%) harbored SCCmec type V, strongly suggesting that it was community acquired. However, 16 patients (33.3%) had SCCmec type II, indicating nosocomial infections. Owing to the low prevalence of ORSL in lugdunin production, the association between SCCmec types and lugdunin production remains unclear. The majority of the OSSL lugdunin-producing strains also belonged to ST3-agr II. Regarding the association between lugdunin production and STs, our data strongly suggest that the activity of the lugdunin operon differed among STs. However, the organization of the lugdunin operon and the relative gene expression in lugdunin-non-producing ST3-SCCmec V-agr II are unclear. Our previous study showed a strong association between the CRISPR/Cas system and STs in S. lugdunensis (13). These findings strongly suggest an association between the CRISPR-Cas system and lugdunin activity in S. lugdunensis, although the role of the CRISPR-Cas system in S. lugdunensis remains unknown.", "Similar to what we observed in the lugdunin-producing group, a different prevalence rate of lugdunin non-production was observed among STs. This led us to speculate why some S. lugdunensis strains failed to produce lugdunin. There are three possibilities: (i) the expression of the lugdunin operon genes in the lugdunin-non-producing group may be low and may not produce lugdunin to exhibit antibacterial activity. (ii) Single-nucleotide polymorphisms or other mutations may occur in the lugdunin operon, leading to truncated or inactive enzymes for lugdunin synthesis. (iii) Other novel gene clusters, ligand enhancers, or inhibitors may also directly or indirectly regulate lugdunin production and activity. Thus, further investigation is required.", "The quorum-sensing agr system is a major element in pathogenicity regulation and biofilm formation in S. aureus (28). S. lugdunensis shares genomic features with S. aureus (29), and our results showed that the agr system might play a role in lugdunin production. To date, the agr locus in S. lugdunensis has been shown to play a role in biofilm formation and resistance to host immune killing; however, its role in lugdunin production has not been investigated (17, 18). Therefore, our study provides a potential role of agr in the regulation and production of S. lugdunensis lugdunin. However, the regulatory mechanisms for lugdunin production by agr remain to be investigated.", "It is also worth noting that lugdunin produced by SL85 was active against various sequence types of S. aureus with different vancomycin susceptibilities. Our results showed that lugdunin had relatively weak antibacterial activity against ST239 VISA compared with that against hVISA and VSSA. However, it is promising baseline data to prompt the use of lugdunin in clinical practice. The synergistic effect of lugdunin antibacterial activity combined with other antibiotics is worth investigating in the future. Hort et al. reported that the alteration of the cell wall architecture with a thick cell wall and low cross-linking provided decoy binding sites for vancomycin and led to a decrease in the susceptibility of S. aureus to vancomycin (30). The antibacterial activity of lugdunin targets bacteria by dissipating their membrane potential (31); therefore, changes in the cell wall architecture of VISA and hVISA may also contribute to their higher resistance to lugdunin. Taken together, we demonstrated the epidemiology of lugdunin production among S. lugdunensis isolates in Taiwan and revealed its association with genotypes. However, the regulatory mechanism by which lugdunin production is regulated remains unclear."]
