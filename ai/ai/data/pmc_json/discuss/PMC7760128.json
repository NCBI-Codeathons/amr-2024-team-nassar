["3. Discussion", "We previously demonstrated that the production of PdG antibiotics plays a role in the PCD of Streptomyces coelicolor [13]. Indeed, when S. coelicolor is unable to produce PdGs on the rich R2YE medium, the second and most important round of cell death does not occur [13]. The function of PCD would be to provide nutrients to the developing aerial hyphae, which later give rise to spores. In this report, we examined the impact of the PdG-associated round of PCD on the timing of morphological development (i.e., the raising of aerial hyphae). We found that the inactivation of redD, the transcriptional activator of PdGs biosynthesis, accelerated the onset of morphological development in this organism. This precocious morphogenesis was evident at the phenotypic level (i.e., aerial hyphae formation, Figure 1) and at the level of transcription of key developmental genes (Figure 5). When PdG production was reduced by the external supply of phosphorylated sugars it also resulted in the accelerated onset of sporulation (Figure 3). In contrast, the introduction of pELT003 (redD on a low-copy-number plasmid) resulted in increased PdG production which delayed and even blocked development (Figure 2). The accelerated development of the redD mutant M510 was also previously suggested in a transcriptomic study of the pathway-specific activators actII-ORFIV and redD mutants [51]. Though not phenotypically described and illustrated in their transcriptional analysis, Huang and colleagues also reported the overexpression of sporulation-associated genes such as four of the eight ORFs of the whiE locus in the redD mutant [51].", "At this stage one could also postulate that the observed precocious sporulation of the PdG non-producing mutant would not be due to the absence of PdGs but might be the consequence of the altered expression of putative redD-dependent sporulation genes. Based on the transcriptomic analysis of the redD mutant, in addition to genes of the red cluster, only six transcription units\u2014called \u201cecr\u201d for expression coordinated with red\u2014showed their expression downregulated due to redD deletion. Among these were ecrA1/A2 which disruption revealed to be two-component system involved in the activation of PdG synthesis [52]. The same conclusion was deduced for another two-component system ecrE1/E2 [53]. The other ORFs, whose expression depends on RedD, are ecrB (SCC121.22c), which encodes a putative membrane protein, ecrC (SCD12A.15c) and ecrD (SCC61A.37c), which, respectively, are proposed to encode an integral membrane ATPase and a secreted protein of unknown function, and finally ecrF (SC1A6.12c), which is a hypothetical protein. The biological function of these four additional RedD target genes being unknown, we therefore indeed cannot exclude that one, or some of them could be involved in the morphological differentiation of S. coelicolor. As an important validation of our hypothesis that RedD acts via PdGs themselves, the chemical inhibition of PdG production by adding phosphorylated sugars to the R2YE medium\u2014and therefore without affecting the redD locus\u2014also resulted in accelerated sporulation (Figure 3). This supports the evidence that PdGs are the causing agents that delay the onset of aerial mycelium formation.", "How might the absence of a toxic compound accelerate the timing of sporulation? One possibility is that when S. coelicolor is impaired in producing PdGs, the abundant still-viable biomass rapidly consumes the remaining nutrients and this starvation initiates the developmental program sooner. Indeed, sporulation represents the culmination of the life(cycle) for sporulating microorganisms. As the onset of this state of dormancy is costly and irreversible, microorganisms must consider all alternatives to survive under hostile conditions before triggering sporulation. One of these alternatives would be the killing of the large majority of the vegetative mycelium in order to lower the consumption of the remaining nutrients and provide nutrients from the dying hyphae to feed the survivors. A similar scenario has been previously documented and connected with bacterial developmental processes, such as the cannibalism in Bacillus subtilis, and fratricide in Streptococcus pneumonia [32]. In each case the induced cell death of a portion of the population is considered to provide an advantage to the survivors. Not making PdGs makes S. coelicolor sporulate around 2 days earlier. If sporulation is the end of the life (cycle), it means that under the conditions tested PdGs allow almost to double the lifetime of S. coelicolor.", "Is the delayed sporulation imposed by PdGs a unique phenomenon or do other DNA-damaging molecules or any other non-secreted antibiotics also interfere with the timing of the onset of the developmental program in other streptomycetes? Although many null mutants for the production of one or more antibiotics have been generated in various Streptomyces species, researchers usually did not extend the analysis beyond the production of the studied natural product. However, morphological and chemical differentiation being tightly connected in time and space in streptomycetes, we expect that such mutations would rather frequently affect the onset of spore formation, at least under certain culture conditions. This hypothesis finds evidential support in a recent study of Justin Nodwell\u2019s group who revealed that several compounds targeting the integrity of DNA conferred a sporulation defect (white phenotype of Streptomyces venezuelae) at sub-inhibitory concentrations [54].", "Importantly, we noticed that a small proportion of the vegetative filaments did not produce PdGs (Figure 6a) and therefore remains viable when the large majority of the mycelium is facing the second and most important round of cell death. Why and how is that part of the mycelium protected from mass destruction? The why appears logical: exclusion from PdG-mediated PCD is likely essential as it ensures the survival of those filaments that eventually become the reproductive aerial hyphae, thus ensuring sporulation. We hypothesize that to avoid self-destruction, these PdG non-producing vegetative filaments enter a metabolic dormant state when signals for triggering PdG synthesis are delivered by the first round of cell death. This dormant state would prevent the activation of PdG production in these compartments, and thus save them from PdG-induced DNA and membrane destruction. How then do these compartments sense the impending cell death? The dormant state may be activated by PCD-released organic and inorganic phosphates that are released into the extracellular medium by lysing filaments that already produced PdGs. Indeed, phosphates inhibit PdG production (Figure 3) and cell death [50]. It is attractive to refer to these PdG non-producing filaments as persisters. In both scenarios described above (passive and active mode of survival), resistance would be observed in a small proportion of isogenic cells but with different phenotypes and responses, which fits with the definition of persisters.", "Finally, we never observed the red autofluorescence that was associated with PdG production in aerial hyphae emerging from the vegetative mycelium soaked with PdGs. This result confirms earlier results that the redD promoter (which was fused to the gene of the enhanced green fluorescent protein, eGFP) is only active in \u201caging\u201d vegetative hyphae and not in spore chains, nor in the hyphal compartments adjacent to them [55]. Authors also mentioned that the fluorescence of the \u201cEGFP could only be observed when a proportion of the hyphae had lysed\u201d, further supporting that PdG production correlates in time and space with the cell death of S. coelicolor. Similarly, the time-space monitoring of RedD fused to enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (eYFP), confirmed that RedD is never expressed in aerial hyphae [56]. Taken together, these data suggest that PdG production is required for properly timing the onset of sporulation, increased or reduced production levels resulting in delayed/blocked or accelerated/precocious sporulation, respectively."]
