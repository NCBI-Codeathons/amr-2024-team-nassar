["Discussion", "The results presented here provide evidence that the response regulator Dbv6 and the sensor kinase Dbv22 negatively control A40926 production and that Dbv22 positively controls A40926 resistance. These effects are associated with altered transcription levels. Indeed, strains deleted for these genes are upregulated in the expression of the two key regulators dbv3 and dbv4. Conversely, the \u0394dbv22 mutant strain expresses less dbv7, the only resistance gene present in the dbv cluster. This would suggest that Dbv6 and Dbv22 represent the two components of a signal transduction system responding to some stimuli and controlling key elements of the dbv cluster. Remarkably, deletion of dbv22 can lead to the paradoxical result of a mutant producing increased glycopeptide levels while becoming more sensitive to its own product.", "While TCSs are frequently found in glycopeptide gene clusters, different regulatory strategies are apparently adopted by glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes. Abolition of the response regulator or of the sensor kinase gene in Streptomyces toyocaensis led to increased sensitivity to A4793411. In Amycolatopsis balhimycina, the deletion of genes for the VanRS-like TCS VnlRSAb affected VanY expression in a \u0394vanHAX background31 while did not influence balhimycin production17,31. In the glycopeptide non-producing S. coelicolor, deletion of vanR but not of vanS led to a strain sensitive to vancomycin11. Apart from the VanR genes associated with a vanHAX resistance cassette (e.g, those from S. coelicolor, S. toyocaensis and Actinoplanes teichomyceticus), the gene(s) targeted by VanR in A. balhimycina remain to be identified. Here, we demonstrate that in N. gerenzanensis direct target genes of Dbv6 are the regulatory genes dbv3 and dbv4, and the genes dbv23-dbv22, coding for the acetyltransferase and the sensor kinase, and the dbv24-dbv28 operon, since the transcription of all these genes is induced in the \u0394dbv6 mutant background and that Dbv6 binds to the upstream regions of these genes. Another direct target of Dbv6 but regulated in the opposite manner is the peptidase dbv7 (Fig.\u00a07).", "The impacts of the dbv6 and dbv22 mutations are quantitatively different. First of all, the relative expression levels of the analyzed dbv genes (encoding the positive regulators Dbv3 and Dbv4, the prephenate dehydrogenase Dbv5, the acetyltransferase Dbv23 and the ABC-transported Dbv24) in the \u0394dbv6 mutant are somehow intermediate between those of the parental strain and of the \u0394dbv22 mutant (Fig.\u00a04). In terms of antibiotic resistance, the \u0394dbv22 strain is marginally but consistently more sensitive than the parental strain and the \u0394dbv6 mutant to A40926 and acA40926. Finally, when N. gerenzanensis is grown in production medium, the \u0394dbv6 and the \u0394dbv22 mutants show, up to 48\u2009h, an identical but slightly higher acA40926 production rate than the parental strain, with \u0394dbv22 keeping an equivalent rate up to 7 days and reaching acA40926 levels (350\u2009\u00b5g/mL) significantly higher than \u0394dbv6 and the parental strain (200 and 130\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively; Fig.\u00a03). Remarkably, higher production levels by \u0394dbv22 are achieved despite a slightly lower biomass accumulation (Fig.\u00a03).", "The fact that all the analyzed parameters are more strongly altered in the \u0394dbv22 than in the \u0394dbv6 background suggests that Dbv22 and/or Dbv6 might interact with other response regulators and/or sensor kinases, respectively, present in the cell. Indeed, the N. gerenzanensis genome harbors 43 and 47 TCS pairs, some of them highly related to VanR and VanS (Fig.\u00a08). A homologous of dbv6 gene is present in the N. gerenzanensis genome. The gene is located about 4.5 Mbp away from Dbv6, with which it shows 68% sequence identity and 77% similarity. All 8 diagnostic residues of the phosphorylation site are invariant with Dbv6. The HTH domain is highly conserved.", "Marcone and coworkers19 have previously shown that N. gerenzanensis is essentially sensitive to A40926, that the carboxypeptidase VanY (i.e., Dbv7) provides some protection but that insensitivity to glycopeptides is mostly acquired during growth by some unknown mechanism. That some other resistance mechanism operates in N. gerenzanensis is consistent with our observed lack of transcription of dbv7 in the \u0394dbv6 strain (Fig.\u00a04), a mutant that is as glycopeptide resistant as the parental strain (Fig.\u00a05). Thus, dbv6 does not apparently contribute to glycopeptide resistance while dbv22 does, suggesting that a second resistance mechanism influenced by Dbv22 takes over. The complex interplay of glycopeptide production and resistance is also highlighted by the fact that deletion of dbv7 did not affect A40926 production, as reported by Marcone and coworkers19.", "When added just at 24\u2009h of growth, when no glycopeptide production is detected yet, 0.5\u2009\u00b5g/mL A40926 can strongly induce expression of all tested dbv genes, particularly dbv23 and dbv24. AcA40926 has the opposite effect. The simplest explanation of this observation is that A40926, but not acA40926, binds to a receptor to activate signal transduction, relieving inhibition or leading to a massive transcription of dbv genes. It is tempting to speculate that the receptor that A40926 binds to is actually Dbv22. Indeed, the ~14-fold stimulation of dbv24 upon A40926 addition is remarkably similar to its upregulated expression in the \u0394dbv22 background. Sensor kinases have been shown to be able to recognize and respond to glycopeptides: VanSsc is induced by vancomycin but not by teicoplanin and A479348,11, while the S. toyocaensis VanS sensor kinase is induced by A47934 but not by vancomycin and teicoplanin11.", "In earlier work, we showed that a strain defective in mannose acetylation produces increased levels of A40926 in comparison to the wild type and that this enhanced production can be reverted by adding acA40926 \u2013 but not A40926 \u2013 to the culture at time zero, while addition of acA40926 had no effect on the wild type2. The present and previous results are consistent assuming that acA40926 can also bind to the same receptor but it cannot trigger its activation. Thus, acA40926 would compete with A40926 for the same binding site, acting as an apparent inhibitor of glycopeptide production. Discrimination between the acetylated and desacetylated form of the glycopeptide by N. gerenzanensis can also be observed in the resistance profile of the wild type, which is more sensitive to acA40926 than A40926 (Fig.\u00a05).", "The data presented here and in previous work2,5,6 allow us to refine a possible model for regulation of glycopeptide production in N. gerenzanensis1. When cells are actively growing, transcription of dbv3 and dbv4 is repressed by the direct action of Dbv6, as well as by other factors related to growth (nutritional factors, or quorum sensing systems could control A40926 biosynthesis)5. At the same time, the resistance gene dbv7 is expressed as a safeguard mechanism against small amounts of glycopeptides that might be produced. As growth slows down, expression of the master regulators Dbv3 and Dbv4 increases so that some glycopeptide synthesis can occur. When sufficient A40926 accumulates, repression mediated by Dbv6/Dbv22 is relieved and further expression of the dbv genes can occur, including that of the acetyltransferase dbv23 and of the ABC transporter dbv24, which results in formation of acA40926 form and its export outside of the cell, where it can compete out A40926 for Dbv22 binding, eventually restoring repression exerted by Dbv6/Dbv22.", "This mechanism is somehow reminiscent of the feed forward mechanism proposed for microbisporicin/NAI-107 production in Microbispora corallina, where a late pathway intermediate can activate production32 through the activation of the ECF sigma factor \u03c3MibX, sequestered at the membrane level by an antisigma factor. An unknown signal should lead to production of microbisporicin, the inactivation of the anti-sigma factor, the release of \u03c3MibX, and high-level expression of the entire gene cluster. Interestingly, both A40926 and NAI-107 target lipid II33, are produced by two strains belonging to different genera of the order Streptosporangiales that contain 3\u20133 cross-linked dimers in their cell wall and that are highly sensitive to their own product33."]
