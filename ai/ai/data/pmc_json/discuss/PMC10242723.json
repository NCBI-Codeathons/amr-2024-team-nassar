["Discussion", "In this study, we investigated and compared different 3D features of the S. coelicolor chromosome in two growth phases with different metabolic situations; then, we focused on the influence of chromosomal topology on the expression of embedded genes, and finally applied the potential 3D regulation mechanism to realize the high production of natural products.", "In both phases, the partial incoordination between genetic partition and 3D compartmentalization was demonstrated in our study (Fig. 1 E and F and SI\u00a0Appendix, Fig. S3 E and F). The whole chromosome was insulated into a series of CIDs of different sizes by barriers (Fig. 1B and SI\u00a0Appendix, Fig. S3B), and the genetic features of CID boundaries were primarily consistent with those of other species (9, 11, 15). However, unlike the situation in S. ambofaciens (16), there was no obvious uniformity between the direction of transcription and continuous replication of the genes within CID boundaries. Instead, this consistency mainly existed in the high-expression genes within CID boundaries (Dataset S2). We thus propose that the evolution of the gene\u2019s high expression is partly through the directional convergence between transcription and chromosomal replication, which provides rational design guidance for the heterologous expression of natural products to activate or increase their production. Meanwhile, these CID boundaries were prominently interacting with each other in M phase and decreasing in L phase (Fig. 1H and SI\u00a0Appendix, Fig. S3H). The colocalization and dispersion between these sites in different phases may imply a potential regulatory mechanism to adapt the transformation from vegetative growth to secondary metabolism. A similar situation also exhibits between 14 putative laterally acquired regions (Fig. 1H and SI\u00a0Appendix, Fig. S3H).", "During metabolic differentiation, the global chromosomal organization experienced an extensive and profound rearrangement, mainly characterized by reshaped CIDs and more condensed chromosomes (Fig. 1G and SI\u00a0Appendix, Fig. S4), previously described as the switching from a rather \u201copen\u201d to a \u201cclosed\u201d conformation (16). As the coexpression model of genes within CIDs in Mycoplasma pneumoniae (40), we thus propose that the rearrangement of CIDs and the arising and dissipating of nested domains might modulate with the local transcriptional regulation.", "Given the correlation between the variation of local 3D structure and transcription for BGCs, the red BGC relocates at the boundary of two nested domains with a significant increase in expression in L phase (Fig. 2 B and D). It may mainly be caused by the restraint effect of high local transcription on the diffusion of DNA supercoils or NAP-mediated physically separate domains (9). Along with growth to the subsequent stational phases, the expression strength of the red cluster should be further increased (33), which may result in a sharper and more obvious boundary, as seen with congocidine BGC in S. ambofaciens (16).", "The whole cpk BGC forms an independent interactive domain in L phase only, insulating this cluster from the surrounding chromosome environment, along with the dramatic transcriptional enhancement (Fig. 2 C and E and SI\u00a0Appendix, Fig. S3G). Additionally, we find that the particular DNA region interacting with the rest of the chromosome is just adjacent to this cpk BGC-associated interactive domain (Fig. 2C and SI\u00a0Appendix, Fig. S3A). Some clues are collected to explain this phenomenon: 1) In prokaryotes, the coupled transcription-translation (CTT) model forming \u201cDNA \u00b7 RNAP \u00b7 mRNA \u00b7 ribosome\u201d expression complexes is a typical dogma for prokaryotic gene expression (66). 2) The nascent peptide of the innermembrane proteins, together with the expression complexes, would be translocated to the membrane by specific proteins in \u00a0E. coli (67) and the expression complexes would expand to \u201cDNA \u00b7 RNAP \u00b7 mRNA \u00b7 ribosome \u00b7 protein \u00b7 membrane\u201d. 3) The subcellular localization of PKS proteins was found to be highly associated with the membrane (68, 69). We thus propose that, as a typical type I PKS, the translated nascent peptide of the cpk cluster will be translocated to the membrane together with the complete expression complex \u201ccpk BGC \u00b7 RNAP \u00b7 mRNA \u00b7 ribosome \u00b7 protein \u00b7 membrane\u201d, and during this process, the relative loose region in the boundary of the cpk cluster-associated domain exhibits the global interaction with the whole chromosome for the population Hi-C method. This translocation and interaction may also benefit the diffusion of malonyl-CoA and \u03b3-butyrolactone, which are biosynthesized by the embedded genes to match the secondary metabolic situation in L phase. Finally, the membrane-located complete expression complex with a high local concentration of positive regulator protein and PKS assembly unit contributes to the high-efficiency production and secretion of coelimycin P1.", "Recent research has pointed out the correlation between the transcription and the contact frequency between adjacent bins in some species (2). Considering the potential influence of chromosomal topology on a larger scale on the expression of embedded genes, we optimized FIRE value in our case and found that the transcription strength is highly correlated with FIRE value, i.e., local chromosomal interaction frequency. To further investigate the causality between them, in a pilot experiment, we introduced the gus(a) reporter system to some genomic loci that only consider different FIRE values. The consequence comprised numerous divergent outliers, and subsequent analysis showed that the PC between FIRE value and native transcription strength in regions containing the partly selected loci was very low. We thus propose that some extra factor may dominate the transcription in the low PC region and consequently cause the deviation of the inserted reporter system\u2019s expression. So, in subsequent experiments, the HCR was first defined in which the local chromosomal interaction frequency should be the main determining factor for transcription, and finally the high correlation between the FIRE value in HCR and \u03b2-glucuronidase activity in all sites confirmed the scenario (Fig. 3 E and F). This significant correlation is reproduced in the subsequent RK-682 test (Fig. 4 C and D). These data showed that the method had the potential application value to promote the production of target natural products due to the obvious enhancement in both \u03b2-glucuronidase and RK-682 production compared with the attB control. However, the genuine cause underlying this discovery needs more research to shed light, and some hypotheses were proposed here. The complicated development and differentiation cycle and exquisite spatiotemporal gene regulation of Streptomyces indicate they are a specific advanced species that somewhat resemble fungi, for which some possible high-dimensional gene regulation mechanisms may have evolved. For instance, the prokaryotic enhancer-like element (70) may be enriched in high FIRE value loci and increase the expression of the embedded gene through frequent cis-interaction. Additionally, for some underlying translocation mechanisms, some chromosomal regions may be translocated to the \u201ctranscriptional factory\u201d, which was described as the spatiotemporal colocalization between the high-expression gene and the local hot spot for the high concentrations of the machinery required for mRNA biosynthesis (71, 72). The spatiotemporal colocalization accounts for the high local chromosome interaction frequency, and the special hubs make the embedded genes highly efficient in transcription."]
