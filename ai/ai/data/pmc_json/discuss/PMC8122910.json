["3. Discussion", "In the present study, we demonstrated that the consumption of isomaltulose could modulate the composition and structure of gut microbial populations. In particular, the abundance of beneficial microbes increased, whereas the level of conditioned pathogen decreased by isomaltulose supplementation. Moreover, we showed that isomaltulose ingestion affected bile acid metabolism and SCFAs metabolism in the intestines.", "The rats fed with isomaltulose showed lower body weight than the control rats (p < 0.05, Figure 1A). Consistently, the food intake in the IsoMTL group was significantly decreased (p < 0.05, Figure 1B). In accordance with our results, a recent study also demonstrated that healthy overweight/obese subjects consumed the diet containing isomaltulose, which resulted in a profound weight loss and an obvious decrease in fat mass [25]. Another animal experiment also showed a notably lower body weight gain and food consumption rate when dietary food with isomaltulose [26]. Previous researches have reported that isomaltulose supplementation retards gastric emptying time, which leads to prolonged satiety and reduced energy intake [27]. Moreover, isomaltulose is a low Glycemic index (GI) ingredient, which triggers no significant increase in blood glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR, thus consistent with our results. The oral glucose tolerance test exhibited that the consumption of isomaltulose contributed to promoting the recovery of blood glucose level in rats. In addition, the serum concentration of TG was significantly lower in the IsoMTL group than the control group (p < 0.05, Figure 1E), which was consistent with published human and animal experimental results [28,29]. These results suggest that ingestion of isomaltulose may have a potential metabolic benefit.", "In the present study, the alpha-diversity indices, Chao, and Shannon index, were significantly reduced in the IsoMTL group when compared to the control group (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). Previous in vitro experiments indicated that isomaltulose might be a prebiotic [20,21]. Moreover, prebiotic is described as a substrate that is selectively utilized by the selected host microorganisms conferring healthy benefit [6]. Herein, we could hypothesize that the reduction in alpha diversity is related to the selectively stimulating effects of isomaltulose on several microbial communities. This hypothesis may be supported by recent reports, where ingestion of prebiotics. Inulin, FOS, GOS, cellulose, and xylooligosaccharides (XOS) also resulted in a lowered alpha-diversity [30,31]. PCoA score plot (beta-diversity) accounts for the similarity in microbial community [32]. Here, all samples were clustered into two groups, namely IsoMTL group and control group, which indicated that there was a substantial difference in bacterial similarity between the rats fed with and without isomaltulose (Figure 2C,D). Therefore, our data demonstrated that isomaltulose affected the diversity of gut microbiome.", "To further identify the specific effects of isomaltulose on microbial species, we performed the LEfSe analysis based on the 16S rRNA sequencing data from phylum to genus. At the phylum level, the consumption of isomaltulose elevated the abundance of Actinobacteria, whereas reduced the level of bacterial phyla Patescibacteria (Figure 5). Actinobacteria is one of the four predominant intestinal bacterial phyla, which mainly includes three anaerobe genera Bifidobacteria, Propionibacteria, Corynebacteria, and aerobe genera Streptomyces. Previous studies have demonstrated that the phyla Actinobacteria, especially Bifidobacteria, can produce the glycosyl hydrolases, and hydrolyze the glycosidic bond within disaccharides and polysaccharides, such as FOS, GOS, XOS, inulin, and arabinoxylans [33,34,35]. By which, the species from Actinobacteria are supported to grow and proliferate. Isomaltulose is a naturally occurred disaccharide comprised of glucose and fructose linked by alpha-1,6 glycosidic bond. It can thus be hydrolyzed and utilized by Actinobacteria microbiota. Moreover, the species from Actinobacteria, i.e., Bifidobacteria, also metabolizes carbohydrates into SCFAs, mainly including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid [36]. SCFAs, besides as the primary energy sources for gut epithelial cells, contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, barrier, immunology and host metabolism [36]. In addition, Streptomyces and other filamentous Actinobacteria have anti-tumor effects by producing antibiotics and thus damaging the DNA structure and functions of various tumor cells [37]. The decreased phyla Patescibacteria is likely an opportunistic or saprophytic colonizer. A previous study showed that Patescibacteria was significantly enriched in the group with alcoholic liver disease compared to the control, treatment, and positive groups [38]. Another research study also reported that the abundance of Patescibacteria was elevated in the signet-ring cell carcinoma patients [39].", "Meanwhile, the ingestion of isomaltulose altered the abundance of eighteen bacterial genera (p < 0.05, Figure 5). Among these microbes, the genera Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Phascolarctobacterium, Collinsella, UBA1819, Flavonifractor, and Holdemania were significantly enriched in the IsoMTL group. The elevated genera Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Phascolarctobacterium, and Flavonifractor are the butyrate-producing bacteria, thus indicating that the consumption of isomaltulose could increase the concentration of butyrate [40,41,42]. This was confirmed by our targeted quantitative analysis of SCFAs, where the level of butyric acid showed a significant improvement in the rats fed with isomaltulose when compared to the control rats (p < 0.05, Figure 9). Butyrate has a crucial effect on host physiology and wellness. In addition to providing energy for the colonocytes, butyrate can suppress NF-\u03baB transcription factor activation and interferon gamma and upregulate PPAR\u03b3, which thus withstand colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases [43,44,45,46,47]. Besides, the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii from the genera Faecalibacterium has been also demonstrated to increase the tight junction protein expression, which, thus, affects paracellular permeability and maintains gut barrier function [48,49]. Succinate is a crucial substrate for the proliferation of Clostridioides difficile, which causes severe diarrhea. A recent study demonstrated that the Phascolarctobacterium species completely consumed succinate and thus inhibited the growth of C. difficile [50]. The species Flavonifractor plautii is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium from the genera Flavonifractor belonging to Firmicutes. An animal experiment demonstrated that oral intervention of Flavonifractor plautii ameliorated antigen-induced Th2 immune responses and allergy by inhibiting interleukin-4 and IgE production and augmenting CD4+CD25+ T cells and CD103+CD11c+ DCs [51]. Another in vitro and in vivo study showed that the viable and heat-killed Flavonifractor plautii reduced inflammatory responses by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 [52]. It is well known that isomaltulose has a tooth-friendly property. The mechanisms may be the structure of isomaltulose comprising glucose and fructose monomers linked by the stable \u03b1-1,6 glycosidic bond, which prevent the fermentation and acid production by oral bacteria [53]. Shuttleworthia is the normal component of oral microbiome. Shuttleworthia satelles belonging to the genera Shuttleworthia was isolated from infected root canals of teeth with endodontic abscesses, and closely related to the occurrence and development of periodontal disease [54,55]. This may be supported by a recent clinical trial, where the species Shuttleworthia satelles was enriched in the preschool children with caries [56]. Therefore, we speculate that the consumption of isomaltulose prevents cavities likely through the inhabitation of the growth of oral Shuttleworthia satelles. Overall, isomaltulose (e.g., FOS, GOS, and inulin) selectively promotes the growth of beneficial microbes, and inhibits the proliferation of pathogens.", "The functional prediction analysis based on 16S rRNA sequencing data showed that the consumption of isomaltulose has a wide effect on biological functions in rats (Figure 7 and Figure 8). In our study, the abundance of carbohydrate metabolism, including starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, was enhanced by ingestion of isomaltulose. This indicated that the enriched intestinal bacteria contributed to fermenting and utilizing dietary fiber, thus improving the bioavailability and absorption of minerals in the intestines [57]. There was a significant decrease in arachidonic acid metabolism in the rats fed with isomaltulose. Previous studies have demonstrated that arachidonic acid is metabolized into prostaglandins, thromboxane, and leukotrienes by cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P450, respectively [58]. These metabolites of arachidonic acid provoke inflammatory responses [59]. Moreover, the level of energy metabolism, such as oxidative phosphorylation, was significantly enriched in the IsoMTL group. Oxidative phosphorylation has a close relationship to the energy supply through lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Thus, isomaltulose ingestion might promote fat oxidation and energy efficiency. This could be supported by decreased body weight and food intake.", "The abundance of bile acid metabolism, mainly secondary bile acid biosynthesis, was elevated by the consumption of isomaltulose. Our targeted metabolomic profiling showed that dietary isomaltulose enhanced the concentration of CA, whereas reduced the levels of DCA, HDCA, LCA, and DHCA (p < 0.05, Figure 8). CA is one crucial component of bile acids, which have a substantial effect on cholesterol homeostasis and participates in various metabolic processes as signaling molecules, i.e., lipid metabolism, cardiac, and gastrointestinal functions. Previous studies showed that CA promoted the reduction of cholesterol [60,61]. This was also in accordance with our results, where the level of TG was significantly lowered in the IsoMTL group (p < 0.05, Figure 2E). It is well known that CA is catalyzed into DCA and LCA by 7\u03b1-dehydroxylation from anaerobic microbiota, such as Clostridium [24,62]. Moreover, 7\u03b1-dehydroxylation is the strictly limited enzyme in the conversion of CA to DCA and LCA. In the present study, there was a significant decrease in the abundance of Clostridium species. This resulted in a reduction in 7\u03b1-dehydroxylation and thus in DCA and LCA. DCA and LCA can be modified into DHCA via several gut microbial enzymes. The decreased DCA and LCA further led to lessening DHCA. Herein, the consumption of isomaltulose regulates bile acid metabolism, likely related to the modulation of gut microbiota.", "Mounting evidences have shown that SCFAs have a pivotal role in the homeostasis, barrier, inflammatory responses and epithelial integrity in the intestines [63]. SCFAs are the crucial metabolites of gut microbiota, and conversely modulate the composition of intestinal bacteria [2]. In the present study, the SCFAs-producing bacteria, including Faecalibacterium, Blautia, and Phascolarctobacterium, were notably enriched in the rats fed with isomaltulose. This may lead to the elevation of SCFAs. Consistently, our study exhibited a significant increase in total SCFAs, propionate, and butyrate in the IsoMTL group by GC profiling (p < 0.05, Figure 9). This was also supported by previously published in vitro studies, where propionate and butyrate were elevated when co-culture of microbial species with isomaltulose [21,22]. Additionally, according to functional prediction analysis based on 16S rRNA sequencing data, the abundance of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism was higher in the rats administered with isomaltulose. In the metabolic pathway, alanine is converted into pyruvate through the deaminization. Pyruvate can be metabolized to propionate through the succinate pathway or the acrylate pathway [2]. It is likely persuasive that Phascolarctobacterium species can produce propionate via the succinate pathway. In addition, pyruvate is also converted to butyrate by beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA [2]. Therefore, the administration of isomaltulose enhances SCFAs-producing microbiota and thus the level of SCFAs."]
