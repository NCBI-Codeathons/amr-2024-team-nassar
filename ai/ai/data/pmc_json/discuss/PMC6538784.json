["DISCUSSION", "Unlike most bacterial pathogens, which are highly sensitive to zeamines (9, 10), the zeamine producer D. zeae EC1 can withstand a high level of zeamines. In this study, we identified a novel RND efflux pump, DesABC, that plays a role in resistance against zeamines, especially at the late stage of bacterial growth, when zeamines were accumulated at a high level. Null mutation of the efflux pump could lead to up to about a 32-fold decrease in zeamine resistance. In contrast, the DesABC efflux pump was not functional against a range of conventional antibiotics, including ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol. Furthermore, we also showed that desAB expression was growth and zeamine dependent and documented a novel signaling role of zeamines in regulation of desAB transcription. Moreover, we found that deletion of the desB gene could substantially reduce the accumulation of zeamines, suggesting that zeamine biosynthesis and resistance are modulated by coordinated and sophisticated regulatory mechanisms.", "The zeamine biosynthesis genes and desAB were clustered in the genomes of D. zeae EC1 and another three Dickeya species and strains according to bioinformatics analysis (Fig.\u00a01). However, despite their functional relevance (Fig.\u00a04), the results from this study suggest that desAB and zeamine biosynthesis genes are not tightly linked during evolution. This is evident as the genomes of multiple Dickeya species and strains, such as D. zeae Ech586 and D. dadantii 3937, contain desAB but not the zeamine biosynthesis genes. It is possible that the common ancestor of Dickeya contains both desAB and zeamine biosynthesis genes, but some Dickeya species and strains subsequently lost the ability to produce zeamines while maintaining DesABC as a defense mechanism. How the genes responsible for zeamine biosynthesis and resistance have originated during evolution remains to be further investigated. Interestingly, the desAB genes were not found in the vicinity of the zms gene cluster in S. plymuthica strains (Fig.\u00a01), which is also known for production of zeamines (6, 7), suggesting that D. zeae and S. plymuthica have different evolutionary origins of the genes encoding zeamine biosynthesis and resistance.", "The RND family proteins associated with antibiotic resistance can commonly transport a broad spectrum of substrates, which is determined by the corresponding inner membrane proteins of the efflux pumps (14). Most inner membrane proteins in the RND family found in human bacterial pathogens, including E. coli (15), P. aeruginosa (16), Burkholderia (30), and Acinetobacter (31), are related to transportation of multiple structurally dissimilar antibiotics. In contrast, we found that the DesABC efflux system of D. zeae EC1 was zeamine specific (Table\u00a01; see also Table\u00a0S5 in the supplemental material). Interestingly, two RND efflux pump systems found in Erwinia amylovora, a plant bacterial pathogen causing fire blight disease, also displayed narrow substrate specificity. Overexpression of these two RND efflux systems, MdtABC and MdtUVW, only resulted in the increment of MIC of several phytochemicals but had no effect on various conventional antibiotics (21), including some antibiotics used in our study (Table\u00a0S5). Given that both D. zeae and E. amylovora are plant pathogens with little exposure to conventional antibiotics, these findings agree with the previous findings about the linkage between intrinsic resistance and the habitat of environmental bacteria (32). The narrow substrate specificity of MdtABC and MdtUVW in E. amylovora and DesABC in D. zeae EC1 may reflect the ancient role of the corresponding RND efflux pumps for bacteria to survive in hazardous environments generated by bacteria themselves or by other organisms.", "Intriguingly, our results showed that inactivation of the desABC genes could cause different levels of decrement in the MIC of zeamines. Mutation of desA or desB led to only about an 8-fold decrease in MIC compared with that of the control strain (Table\u00a01), while inactivation of desC could result in about a 32-fold decrease. A plausible explanation is that similar to its homolog tolC in E. coli (15), other proteins in strain EC1 are able to replace DesAB and form a functional transportation system with DesC to efflux zeamines. In addition, heterologous expression of desABC in E. coli resulted in only about a 2-fold increment in the MIC of zeamines, which was not comparable to the MIC changes when desABC were deleted in strain EC1. We first checked the possibility of whether the differences in GC content and codon usage of these two bacterial species affect the expression efficiency of desABC genes in E. coli. Our previous study showed that the GC content of the D. zeae EC1 genome is 53.43% (12), which is not identical but not substantially different from the GC content (50.8%) of E. coli strain K-12 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse#!/prokaryotes/Escherichia%20coli%20K-12). Strain K-12 is the parental strain of E. coli strain DH5\u03b1 used in this study. At the codon usage level, both bacteria have more or less similar codon usage patterns, except that the rarely used codon CUA in E. coli is a frequently used codon in the coding sequence of desB in D. zeae EC1 (Table\u00a0S6). We then examined the potential toxic effect of overexpressed DesABC in E. coli, as other overexpressed membrane proteins commonly exhibit detrimental effects on bacterial growth (33). We found that E. coli growth was markedly retarded when DesABC were overexpressed (Fig.\u00a0S4). Taken together, it is most likely that overexpressed DesABC membrane proteins affect the bacterial normal physiological functions and, hence, compromise the ability to withstand zeamines.", "Heterologous expression of DesABC affects the growth of Escherichia coli. E. coli strain without plasmids (E. coli DH5\u03b1), E. coli strain with control plasmids [E. coli DH5\u03b1(pAmob, pBB)], and E. coli strain with desABC [E. coli DH5\u03b1(pAmob-desC pBB-desAB)] were grown to exponential phase in LB medium. Cell cultures were adjusted to an OD600 of about 0.5 and inoculated to LB medium at a ratio of 0.1%. Growth curves were determined at 37\u00b0C using Bioscreen-C (OY Growth Curves Ab Ltd., Helsinki, Finland) in a low-intensity model by monitoring the optical density of 600 nm. The experiments were individually performed twice. Data shown are the means from three replicates, and error bars indicate the standard deviations.

Download Table\u00a0S6, DOCX file, 0.03 MB.", "Our data indicate that zeamine biosynthesis and DesABC-mediated resistance mechanisms are well coordinated by a sophisticated mechanism(s). The level of desAB gene expression was increased along with accumulation of zeamines (Fig.\u00a03B and C and 4B), and deletion of zmsA, the gene essential for zeamine biosynthesis (4), caused an arrest of the transcriptional expression of desAB (Fig.\u00a04B and C). Significantly, exogenous addition of zeamines to the zmsA mutant could boost desAB expression by more than 30-fold compared with that for water or solvent control (Fig.\u00a04D). The findings thus demonstrated that in addition to their roles as phytotoxins and antibiotics (4, 5, 8\u201310), zeamines can also act as signals in modulation of gene expression (Fig.\u00a04D). The signal role of zeamines in induction of desAB expression was further confirmed in D. dadantii strain 3937 (Fig.\u00a04D), which does not contain a zms gene cluster. Considering the wild distribution of zms gene clusters and desAB homologs in Dickeya species and strains (Fig.\u00a01 and Table\u00a0S3) (8), we hypothesize that Dickeya species and strains have evolved a dedicated pathway to sense extracellular zeamines in self-protection against the detrimental effect of these antibiotics. The key regulators in this pathway might at least include a sensor or receptor protein that detects and responds to zeamines and a transcriptional regulator that modulates the expression of desAB. A gene that encodes a proposed two-component system sensor (NCBI accession number WP_029456608.1) was found near the desAB locus. However, inactivation of this gene did not affect the MIC of zeamines, which seems to preclude its potential link with the regulation of desAB (data not shown). In addition, given that the cellular levels of zeamines are important in induction of the zeamine resistance genes (Fig.\u00a04D), several regulators known to be associated with the regulation of zeamine production and virulence, such as the acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) synthase ExpI (1), transcriptional regulator SlyA (3), and global regulator Fis (46), might also influence the transcriptional expression of desAB through modulating the production of zeamines or even more direct regulatory mechanisms, which demands further investigation.", "In summary, this study documented a first resistance mechanism against zeamines, which are a new family of potent antibiotics with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities. This resistance mechanism is mediated by a novel and substrate-specific RND efflux pump, DesABC. Interestingly, this study also unveiled a signaling role of zeamines in modulation of desAB expression at the transcriptional level, which further expands our understanding about zeamines. In addition, the findings from this study suggest that D. zeae EC1 contains other mechanisms implicated in zeamine resistance besides the DesABC efflux system. This is evident as the MIC of zeamines for D. zeae EC1 was more than 500-fold higher than that for the zeamine-sensitive E. coli DH5\u03b1, whereas inactivation of desC in D. zeae EC1 led to only about a 32-fold decrease in the MIC of zeamines (Table\u00a01). A thorough understanding of the zeamine resistance mechanisms and the cognate regulatory networks might pave the way for practical application of these potent antibiotics and also could provide new insight on the control and prevention of this important bacterial pathogen."]
