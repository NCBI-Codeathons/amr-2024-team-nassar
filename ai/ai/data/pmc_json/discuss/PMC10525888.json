["4. Discussion", "When planning experiments aimed at applying AMPs against eukaryotic (for instance, anti-protozoal) pathogens, we have to take into consideration that the strategy of designing antiprotozoals to control eukaryotic parasites (pathogens) must be different from that of designing antimicrobials to control prokaryotic pathogens [97,98,99]. The targetable intracellular structures of a eukaryotic parasite (pathogen) biochemically might be similar to some intracellular structures of vital functions in the eukaryote host to be protected.", "As for our H. meleagrididis exeriments, we worked in a monoxenic system where prokaryotic and eukaryotics cells coexisted. We found that both the prokaryotic and the eukaryotic cells died when EPB CFCM were added in th right concentration.", "The question is, however, that what was the primary reason for the death of the H. meleagridis cells. They might die (1) because their procaryote mutualistic partner died; (2) they might be killed by a direct antiprotist activity of any (or more) AMP molecules of the EPB CFCMs; or (3) the two killing effects cumulated. Unfortunately, these published experiments cannot give an unambiguous answer to that question. We hope for the answer from our future experiments when we intend to use CFCMs from double (easyPACId) mutants (with hfq-deletion and exchanged (re-activated) promoter of only one AMP-responsible operon. We will search for some which is harmless to prokaryotic partner but kill H. meleagridis cells selectively). It is true, that the peptides killed the mutualistic (E. coli DH5@) bacteria, which itself could be considered as an explanation of the death of the H. meleagridis cells. It is also true, that from our experiments no proof supports the idea that histomonads were killed directly. But we also have evidence that CFCM contains active anti-protist active components as well, (see the Leishmania donovanii data from this study or the published results of the Bode group and others), so the only question is what of these compounds is capable of (in lucky case, selectively) killing H. meleagridis. This is what we intend to learn from our future easyPACId mutant experiments.", "This paper is about the anti-protist potential of anti-microbial compounds produced by entomopathogenic bacterium species (EMA, EMC, and EMK Photorhabdus luminescens TT01) [6,28,29,93], the obligate symbionts of certain entomopathogenic\u2013nematodes (EPN). In laboratory in vitro conditions they release their products into their conditioned culture media (CFCM) in vitro. The chemical nature of these antimicrobials is oligo-peptide. However they are non-ribosomal anti-microbial peptides (NR-AMPs), which means that they are enzymatically synthesized through more than one step in their respective biosynthetic pathways. Those genes encoding for the enzymes forming the respective biosynthetic pathway of given NR-AMP are clustered in a single operon [100], also called biosynthetic gene complex (BGC) [101]. One of the natural roles of the prokaryote partner in the EPN/EPB symbiosis is to protect the given monoxenic symbiotic association in a given polyxenic milieu, producing a chemical toolkit (e.g., a particular set of NR-AMPs) providing competitiveness against the prokaryotic and eukaryotic competitors, including protists. The biosynthesis of the given sets of these effective antimicrobials is synchronized by a unique, genuine hierarchical genetic regulation mechanism called primary-secondary phase shift [71] with the hfq gene on the top [74,75,76,77,78]. In the laboratory liquid culture conditions (as well as in the active symbiotic stage), these compounds are produced abundantly, providing an inexhaustible \u201cgold mine\u201d for the anti-microbial searching scientist. The bioassays of the CFCMs are the tools to find the best sources and optimize the culture conditions. We found that those strains (EMA and EMC) which were discovered and further developed not only by our international team of a \u201claboratory without walls\u201d in those famous laboratories of Maxime Gualtieri in France and Helge Bode in Germany, proving that these two strains are probably best found so far. In addition, other laboratories are probably really excellent sources. The data presented here on anti-leishmanial and anti-histomonal potentials seem to confirm this conclusion. The next step is to find a way to obtain mutants, not \u201cgenetically manipulated\u201d, but mutant strains which produce only single NR-AMP molecules instead of a bunch of them. The method to do that was recently discovered in the Bode laboratory [79,80,81,82,83]. We demonstrate here that we have started this project as well by constructing and characterizing hfq-del mutants from both EPB species EMA and EMC.", "Our larger scope is to benefit from the existence of NR-AMP amongst the metabolites of our EPB bacteria. In other terms, our goals are to beat target pathogens, including prokaryotic pathogenic and zoonic bacteria, and eukaryotic parasites and pathogens of different taxa, which are important from the aspects of importance for animal and human health.", "We are keenly interested in exploring whether the anti-microbial activity of NR-AMP of EMA and EMC can be developed as chemotherapeutic agents to treat protozoa such as the intracellular parasite Leishmania [37] and the extracellular avian pathogen H. gallinarum [97]. Both of these flagellated protozoa have been demonstrated to have unique and efficient resistance mechanisms to other anti-parasitic agents and require the development of additional effective agents. Leishmania spp. is particularly problematic in light of its sophisticated resistance mechanisms, but it is also an excellent model for analyzing the mechanisms of drug resistance in eukaryotes [98,99]. Our research conception is that we think that some Xenorhabdus CFCM molecules (i.e., phenazine, fabclavine, or other molecules) may be selectively capable of dysregulating eukaryotic cell functions and stimulating apoptosis in protozoa without affecting the host [100]. From an application point of view, the development of natural compounds as anti-protozoal requires several aspects to be taken into consideration: (A) the anti-protozoal potential; (B) the durability, thermotolerance, and bioavailability; and (C) cytotoxicity, and unwanted side effects, especially if target organisms are eukaryotic pathogens. We have demonstrated that Xenorhabdus CFCM has broad-spectrum anti-protozoal activity against several human microbial pathogens. The key issue is identifying the specific active molecules in a complex mixture of potential anti-microbial molecules. The CFCMs of all three Xenorhabdus species were all active against Leishmania promastigotes in our experiments, but interestingly, none were active against Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes. Other researchers [83] found that EMA and EMK CFCMs were equally efficient against both Leishmania and Trypanosoma. In that study, they found that X. budapestensis, X. cabanillasii, X. hominickii, X. indica, X. innexii, and X. stockiae supernatants caused 100% mortality at the highest tested concentration (10%) against the promastigote form of L. tropica. No differences occurred between this treatment group and the positive control (p > 0.05) using N-methyl meglumine. There are several possible explanations for the differences between our findings and those of the Turkish team. For instance, the two studies used different strains of T. cruzi. In addition, there are differences in the experimental methods used between the two studies. In the case of the differential susceptibility of L. amazoennsis and T. cruzi (Brazil strain), it is likely due to differences in the surface compositions between the two parasites that lead to differential disruption of the cell membrane and/or intracellular penetration to act on specific subcellular targets. We focus on EMA and EMC species. We compared the anti-microbial potential of each of the used hfq-del mutants before using them as the source of double mutants producing single NR-AMPs. Our data in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 show that the anti-microbial activities of the hfq-del mutants can have enhanced anti-microbial activity not present in the wild-type stains. This may not be quite surprising considering that approximately 7.5% of the total genes in Xenorhabdus bacteria are dedicated to secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and probably most of these products are NR-AMPs. With an average 2.4 Mb-genome size of Xenorhabdus and a 1 kb locus size with about 10 ORFs per operon, there are 2400 genes and 240 respective operons (BGS) per genome. It is comparable with that of Staphylococcus, which has about 225 operons. According to the data accumulated, only about a dozen of biosynthetic anti-microbials have been discovered. In our lab, we intend to work with about 12 operons, responsible for the biosynthesis of 12 NR-AMPs in EMC, and operons which are responsible for 3 NR_AMPs in EMA under hfq regulations.", "However, we cannot rule out that there are several other operons encoding for the synthesis of additional anti-microbial compounds, which are not under hfq control. In the future, we intend to establish and analyze RNA-seq from our wild-type stains and their hfq mutants. We hypothesize that the situation is somewhat simpler since the hfq likely regulates a well-defined group of operons providing the genetic machinery for the so-called \u201cprimary-secondary phase shift\u201d [72] (or \u201cphenotypic phase variation\u201d, the term of Professor S. A. Forst), which describes that only a relatively small set of natural products (NP) are anti-microbial synthetic genes. Toxicity studies using J774 macrophages [66,67] have indicated that only the CFCM of EMA was able to cause significant mortality of these cells. In contrast, the CFCMs of EMC or EMK had no effect. This experiment confirmed our previous unpublished observations that EMA exerts stronger cytotoxicity on a range of eukaryotic cells, which may cause limitations concerning future medical applications. However, this selective cytotoxicity may provide an option to select for and find specific CFCMs against different eukaryotic parasites of different animal and plant hosts. Interestingly, our studies with J774 cells and the CFCMs of EMA, EMC, and EMK did not show toxicity. These differences may be related to different experimental methods or differences in the bacterial and cell types used.", "Overall, in light of the availability of few agents for the treatment of leishmaniasis and the increasing incidence of development resistance, there is a demand for new agents [100,101,102,103]. Moving forward, drug discovery will be based on complete genome sequencing of multiple strains, utilization of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for gene inactivation, in vivo, and bioluminescence-based imaging together with high-throughput analysis of compounds [44]. As for the results in the control (bacterium, fungi, and other strains), previous studies have identified several anti-microbial molecules in the CFCM of Xenorhabdus, including fabclavine [25,26]. This strange metabolite polypeptide/polyketide hybrid molecule is synthesized via non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. Many different-sized derivatives of fabclavines can be produced by X. szentirmaii [80] and can vary between entomopathogenic\u2013nematode\u2013symbiont (Xenorhabdus, Photorhabdus) bacterium species [80] (Wenski et al., 2019). These have a wide-ranging anti-microbial activity against various microbes [29]. Several other anti-microbial molecules are known to be produced by different EPB species and released into their CFCMs. Xenofuranone A and B [104], cabanillasin [105], PAX peptides [106], odilorhabdins [107], cyclic depsipeptides (xenematides, F and G), anti-oomycete peptides [108], novel anti-microbial peptides [109], xenortide [110], xenortides, rhabdopeptided/xenortide-like peptides [111], other rhabdopeptides [112], and szentiamid [113,114] have been discovered in the last ten years in different Xenorhabdus species.The proper approach is the easyPACId method, based on the latest information on the highest organization level of gene regulation in bacteria [115,116,117,118,119,120]. Whether any of them can be considered a potential anti-histomonal drug candidate will be learned if we had a chance to screen both the single mutant hfq-del stains of EMA and EMC."]
