["DISCUSSION", "The phosphonate natural products produced by P. ananatis LMG5342 are the principal virulence factor involved in onion center rot. Indeed, our data show that application of purified pantaphos produces identical lesions in the absence of bacteria. Although bioactive phosphonate natural products are well known, data supporting a direct role for these molecules in pathogenesis are rare. To date, the sole known example is a complex phosphonate-modified polysaccharide produced by Bacteroides fragilis, which was shown to promote abscess formation in the mammalian gut (28, 53). The demonstration that pantaphos is both necessary and sufficient for onion center rot adds a second phosphonate natural product to this short list and confirms the predicted function of the P. ananatis hvr locus proposed by Asselin et al. (18).", "Despite the fact that unmodified pantaphos is phytotoxic, it seems likely that modified derivatives of the compound are also produced by P. ananatis. As described above, the hvr locus encodes two ATP-Grasp proteins. Members of this protein family often catalyze the ATP-dependent formation of peptide bonds, including those found in the peptidic phosphonate natural products rhizocticin, plumbemycin, and phosphonoalamide (54\u201356). Addition of amino acid substituents often enhances uptake of bioactive compounds. For example, phosphinothricin tripeptide is a potent antibacterial compound, while unmodified phosphinothricin has poor activity (57). It should be noted, however, that these transport-mediated effects are species specific. Thus, phosphinothricin and phosphinothricin tripeptide are equally effective herbicides (58). A particularly striking example of specificity conferred by amino acid substituents is seen in the bioactivity profile of rhizocticin and plumbemycin. These natural products have the same bioactive phosphonate warhead attached to different amino acids, which presumably governs their uptake by specific peptide transport systems. As a result, rhizocticin is a potent antifungal agent that lacks antibacterial activity, whereas plumbemycin is a potent antibacterial that lacks antifungal activity (59). Based on these precedents, we suspect that peptidic derivatives of pantaphos may be produced during plant infection that increase its potency or specificity for a particular target species, perhaps accounting for the unstable compound 3 we observed in spent media.", "Interestingly, pantaphos is not the only phosphonate produced by P. ananatis species. At least four distinct phosphonate biosynthetic gene clusters can be found in the currently sequenced P. ananatis genomes. With the exception of the hvr operon, neither the structures nor the biological functions of the molecules produced by these gene clusters can be suggested at this time; however, our data clearly show that the pgb cluster is not required for onion center rot. Significantly, the strict correlation between plant pathogenicity and the presence of the hvr operon breaks down when larger numbers of Pantoea genomes are analyzed. Accordingly, P. ananatis strains PA4 and PNA 14-1 lack the hvr operon but still cause onion rot, whereas strains PANS 04-2, PNA 07\u201310, and PNA 200-7 carry the hvr locus but do not cause the disease. These data indicate that additional virulence traits are important for onion pathogenesis in Pantoea species. They also demonstrate the need for caution when using the presence/absence of the hvr cluster as a marker for plant pathogenicity.", "Gene clusters similar to the hvr locus are relatively common in sequenced bacterial genomes; however, their phylogenetic distribution is rather restricted. Interestingly, many of the bacteria encoding these hvr-like gene clusters are associated with either plant or insect hosts. Homologs of the hvr operon are particularly abundant in members of the closely related Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus genera. These bacteria have a unique lifestyle that relies on infection of an insect host via a nematode vector (60). Similarly, an hvr locus is found in Bartonella senegalensis OS02, a putative intracellular pathogen of mammals (61). Given the cytotoxic effects we observed in human cells, it is tempting to suggest that pantaphos-like compounds may be involved in bacterial pathogenesis in both insects and humans. Homologs of the hvr operon are also seen in several members of the actinobacteria, including species of Streptomyces. These bacteria, which are common epiphytes and endophytes, are known for their production of a wide array of secondary metabolites, including antibacterial, antifungal, and phytotoxic compounds (62, 63). Thus, it seems likely that bioactive pantaphos-like molecules are important for mutualistic interactions of actinobacteria as well.", "The idea that pantaphos and its putative derivatives are involved in diverse mutualistic interactions begs the question of the biological target for these molecules. Among the organisms tested to date, only plants and human cells show significant sensitivity to pantaphos, while bacteria and fungi were completely insensitive to the molecule. A simple explanation for these observations is that the target is shared by plants and animals and absent from bacteria and fungi. Alternatively, the target could be shared by all organisms but be sufficiently different in bacteria and some fungi that it is not sensitive to the molecule. It is also possible that bacteria and some fungi share the ability to inactivate pantaphos or that they are incapable of transporting the molecule into their cells. Significant experimental effort, beyond the scope of this initial report, will be required to distinguish between these possibilities; however, at least for E. coli, the data suggest that a lack of transport is not responsible for the absence of bioactivity. Possible targets for pantaphos can be envisioned based on the structure of pantaphos, which is similar to a number of common metabolites, including citrate, isocitrate, aconitate, isopropylmalate, and maleate. Because most characterized phosphonates act as molecular mimics of normal cellular metabolites, this suggests the possibility that pantaphos may target the TCA cycle or leucine biosynthesis. Because maleic acid compounds are known to inhibit transaminases, it is also possible that the molecule inhibits the synthesis of another essential amine-bearing metabolite (64).", "Finally, the studies described here have significant agricultural implications, which provide strong motivation for future studies on the biosynthesis and molecular target of pantaphos, as well as potential mechanisms for resistance to the compound. The identification of pantaphos as the principal virulence factor in onion rot suggests multiple approaches to deal with agricultural infestations of Pantoea ananatis. Because the molecule is required for virulence, it seems likely that inhibitors of the pantaphos biosynthetic pathway would prevent plant infection. It should also be possible to identify the molecular target of the compound in plants using purified or synthetic pantaphos, which would pave the way for development of crops with resistant alleles that would be immune to the disease. Plants expressing the putative pantaphos-modifying enzymes encoded by the hvr locus, or unrelated phosphonate catabolic genes, would also be expected to be specifically resistant to Pantoea infection. Finally, there is a desperate need to develop new treatments that are effective in combatting the alarming rise of herbicide-resistant weeds (65, 66). The potent phytotoxicity of pantaphos suggests that it may have agricultural utility similar to that of the widely used phosphonate herbicides glyphosate and phosphinothricin. The real possibility of developing pantaphos-resistant crops strengthens this idea, as does the absence of bioactivity toward bacteria and fungi, suggesting that the molecule would have minimal effects on the soil microbiome. A note of caution is appropriate, however, given the moderate cytotoxicity we observed in human cell lines."]
