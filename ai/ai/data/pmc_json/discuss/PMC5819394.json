["Discussion", "Methylation is an important reaction in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites in both plants and microorganisms, where it contributes significantly to the chemical diversity of the products (31, 32). The results presented here significantly advance our understanding of the way in which methylation shapes the branched biosynthetic pathway to the gentamicin C complex, an established drug used to combat serious infections. These insights are key to the success of efforts to redirect the course of biosynthesis toward specific components of the complex and give an appreciation of the scope for altering the methylation pattern on the gentamicin pseudotrisaccharide scaffold to generate various metabolites for testing as antibiotics or for other therapeutic indications (3). Methyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of natural products have considerable potential for the engineering of new derivatives (33\u201335). There is renewed interest in aminoglycoside antibiotics (3, 36) driven in part by the increasing incidence of pathogenic strains resistant to many other antibiotics but also by encouraging evidence that toxicity and vulnerability to resistance mechanisms can be ameliorated by semisynthesis (37). For example, etimicin is prepared from gentamicin C1a (38) and plazomicin (currently in phase III trials) from the gentamicin-like sisomicin (39). If the single components of the gentamicin C complex can be efficiently prepared by low-cost direct fermentation, it will widen the scope for such efforts.", "In previous work, three consecutive methylation steps in the later stages of gentamicin biosynthesis have been firmly established as being catalyzed, respectively, by the 3\u2032\u2032-N-methyltransferase GenN, the 4\u2033-C-methyltransferase GenD1, and the 6\u2032-C-methyltransferase GenK (19, 20, 28). However, here we have shown that the three methylations may take place in an alternative order, giving rise to a form of network. A commercial batch of gentamicin C has been shown to contain as trace contaminants gentamicins lacking one or more of these methyl groups (27), and specific deletion of genN has been shown, for example, to increase the yield of several 3\u2032\u2032-N-desmethylgentamicins (19, 28). To explore this further, we therefore constructed the complete combinatorial set of seven mutants in which one, two, or all three of methyltransferase genes had been independently deleted in-frame. LC-ESI-HRMS analysis of these mutants gave indications of the substrate flexibility of these enzymes.", "First, the \u0394genD1\u0394genK\u0394genN mutant produced no intermediate more advanced than 2, which confirms that no other methyltransferase present in M. echinospora can methylate this molecule. Also as expected, in \u0394genD1\u0394genK, \u0394genN\u0394genK, and \u0394genD1\u0394genN, 3, 6, and 7, respectively, were seen. In the \u0394GenK mutant, GenN clearly out-competes GenD1 because the products are those of the normal pathway: 3 and 4. In the \u0394genD1 mutant, GenK and GenN collaborate to produce doubly methylated 9 via either 3 or 7, while in the \u0394genN mutant, GenK and GenD1 collaborate to produce doubly labeled 10 via either 6 or 7.", "Purification of the intermediates accumulated in these mutants also provided a panel of gentamicin metabolites. Further insight into methyltransferase substrate specificity was gained by feeding these individual metabolites to strains of M. echinospora stripped of the resident gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster, except for a resistance gene and genN, genD1, or genK. The results showed that GenK and GenD1 are somewhat more versatile than GenN in accepting alternative substrates (Fig. 3). Even so, 6 is not a substrate for either GenK or GenN, so 10 must be formed via 7, and since 10 is not a substrate for GenN, neither 6 nor 10 are competent intermediates in biosynthesis of the gentamicin C complex. Thus, the only minor alternative pathways that can contribute to production of the gentamicin C complex lead from 3 to 9 to 5, inverting the normal order in which GenD1 and GenK act, or from 2 to 7 to 9 to 5, if GenK acts before GenN and GenD1 (Fig. 1). Agar diffusion assays against Bacillus pumilis showed that, with the important exception of the natural intermediate X2, derivatives tested that lacked any of the core methylations of the gentamicin C complex were essentially inactive (SI Appendix, Fig. S7), emphasizing the importance of both the pattern and the extent of this modification for antibiotic activity. The relatively tight selectivity of the three methyltransferases rationalizes why the conventional pathway dominates in the wild type. Although these results provide proof of concept for directing biosynthesis toward gentamicin-related metabolites with altered methylation patterns, enzyme engineering to modify substrate specificity would be required to make this an efficient process, and further modification of those templates would be required to restore antibiotic activity.", "The biosynthetic genes for all aminoglycoside antibiotics so far studied are found clustered together on the genome, and this has greatly facilitated their analysis (13, 17). A surprising feature of the gentamicin biosynthesis in M. echinospora is that the methyltransferase gene genL, which we have shown here is essential to catalyze the terminal methylations, is located 2.54 Mbp away from the known biosynthetic gene cluster. This was previously annotated as an orphan methyltransferase, along with many other similar genes in M. echinospora, and it is not located near any recognizable genes of specialized metabolism. The dependence of a biosynthetic gene cluster on the collaboration of a remotely located gene is not unprecedented (40), and its discovery here demonstrates the power of a genome-driven approach to uncover such \u201cmissing\u201d elements of a biosynthetic pathway. Whether GenL also catalyzes a different reaction in primary or specialized metabolism is unknown. We have characterized recombinant GenL as a homodimeric SAM-dependent enzyme with exactly the expected substrate specificity. GenL showed no activity against earlier intermediates in the pathway. GenL bears very limited sequence similarity to the 3\u2032\u2032-N-methyltransferase GenN, and it would be of considerable interest to compare the crystal structures, substrate ranges, and reaction mechanisms of these two enzymes.", "The separation of gentamicin C components has previously been at least partially achieved by chemical derivatization, column chromatography, and deprotection (8). The present work shows the feasibility, with the identity and role of every methyltransferase established, of achieving the same goal more conveniently by direct fermentation of an appropriately engineered mutant strain. Given the growing global threat of antibiotic resistance, it is of pressing importance to maximize the potential of the existing arsenal of antibacterial compounds, as well as to seek new targets. The results that we have obtained should encourage the use of individual congeners as starting points for semisynthesis to create novel aminoglycosides, Also, the reportedly lower toxicity of certain components of the gentamicin C complex (6, 7) deserves to be fully and critically evaluated, and the present work brings this prospect closer."]
