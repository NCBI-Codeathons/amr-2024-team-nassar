["3 Results and discussion", "3.1 Changes in OM, temperature, MC, pH, and EC during composting with and without biochar", "As shown in Figure 1A, the OM content in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments presented a downward trend during composting process. Compared with the CK treatment, the OM degradation rate in the CK+Biochar treatment was faster during 1\u201310\u00a0days, which was owing to the unique surface structure of biochar that provided a suitable environment for microbial activities and promoted decomposition and metabolism of OM (S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2015). Most of the microorganisms that degrade OM are aerobic, and the biochar addition improved the aeration conditions during the composting process and facilitated contact between microorganisms and oxygen. The biochar used in the present study can conduct electricity (Supplementary Figure S2A), which could accelerate the electron transfer in the oxidation process of OM, thereby promoting OM degradation.", "FIGURE 1Changes in OM (A), temperature (B), MC (C), pH (D), and EC (E) during composting.", "Changes in OM (A), temperature (B), MC (C), pH (D), and EC (E) during composting.", "During composting, the temperatures of both the CK and CK+Biochar treatments showed similar trends with obvious warming, high-temperature, and cooling period (Figure 1B). However, the high temperature period (>55\u00b0C for 22\u00a0days) in the CK+Biochar treatment was longer than that noted in the CK treatment (>55\u00b0C for 20\u00a0days), which is consistent with the results of a previous study (Awasthi et al., 2020). The temperature increased above 60\u00b0C on days 3 and 8 in the CK+Biochar and CK treatments, respectively, which could be attributed to the additional nutrients and suitable living environment provided by the biochar for microbial activities, facilitating OM degradation and release of heat (Wang et al., 2013). However, the temperature of the CK and CK+Biochar treatments decreased below 40\u00b0C on days 32 and 28, respectively. Nevertheless, both the CK and CK+Biochar treatments in the present study fulfilled the safety regulations in \u201cSanitation of manure without harm,\u201d which require the pile temperature to be >50\u00b0C for at least 10\u00a0days.", "During composting, the MC of the CK and CK+Biochar treatments showed a downward trend (Figure 1C), exhibiting 68.78% and 72.36% decrease at the end of composting, respectively. The presence of biochar can accelerate water loss from the pile, which might be owing to the increase in the porosity of the pile (Liu et al., 2017) and optimization of the pore structure, promoting air circulation in the pile and accelerating evaporation of water (Iqbal et al., 2010). Although the increase in temperature was more rapid in the CK+Biochar treatment, the decrease in MC was slower, when compared with those noted in the CK treatment, during the early stage of composting (days 1\u20136), implying that temperature increase was not the main reason for moisture loss from the pile.", "The pH change during composting was demonstrated in Figure 1D. The pH of both CK and CK+Biochar treatments first exhibited an increasing trend, followed by a decreasing trend, and finally stabilized. The pH values increased up to 8.73 and 8.54 in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments, respectively, on day 10 of the composting process. The volatile emission of NH3 was predominant during the early stage of composting (Mao et al., 2018; Ravindran et al., 2019), leading to an increase in the pH value. When compared with the initial pH value, the pH at the end of the composting process was not significantly different in both CK and CK+Biochar treatments, suggesting that the effect of biochar was not significant on pH variation before and after composting.", "At the end of the composting process, the EC of both CK and CK+Biochar treatments was lower than 4\u00a0mS/cm (Figure 1E), indicating that the final compost product in both the treatments was not phytotoxic (Mao et al., 2018). In the CK treatment, the rapid decline in MC during the first 3\u00a0days may be the main reason for the slight increase in EC, which was 3.14\u00a0mS/cm higher than the initial value. In contrast, the EC of the CK+Biochar treatment was 2.81\u00a0mS/cm lower than the initial value. These results indicated that addition of biochar decreased EC and enhanced the quality of the final compost products.", "3.2 Changes in DOC, DTN, NH4\n+-N, and NO3\n\u2212-N during composting with and without biochar and GI of the compost products", "The DOC content in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments showed the opposite trend in the early stage of composting (Figure 2A). The rapid decrease in the DOC content in the CK+Biochar treatment could mainly be attributed to the quick rise in temperature resulting in an increase in microbial activity (Khan et al., 2014). After 10\u00a0days of composting, the DOC content in the CK treatment started to decrease and the microbial utilization of water-soluble organic matter accelerated, probably owing to the increased activity of thermophilic microorganisms caused by high temperatures at this stage. At the beginning of the composting, the DTN content in the CK+Biochar treatment decreased significantly faster than that in the CK treatment (Figure 2B), which was owing to the rapid increase in the pile temperature of the CK+Biochar treatment. After 10\u00a0days of composting, the DTN content in the CK treatment decreased faster, which was owing to the increased activity of thermophilic microorganisms at this stage. At the end of the composting process, the DOC content decreased by 49.54% and 59.22%, and the DTN content declined by 62.94% and 68.13% in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments, respectively. These results indicated that biochar facilitated the utilization of DOC and DTN by microorganisms.", "FIGURE 2Changes in DOC (A), DTN (B), NH4\n+-N (C), and NO3\n\u2212-N (D) during composting.", "Changes in DOC (A), DTN (B), NH4\n+-N (C), and NO3\n\u2212-N (D) during composting.", "In the present study, the compost substrate contained a large number of organic nitrogen compounds, which generated NH4\n+-N under the action of microorganisms, leading to the increase in the NH4\n+-N content in the early stage of composting. As shown in Figure 2C, the NH4\n+-N content in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments exhibited a decreasing trend, which is not consistent with the previously reported results (Agyarko-Mintah et al., 2017). This may be owing to the high frequency of turning of the pile during the composting period in this study, which promoted oxygen exposure to the microorganisms. As NH4\n+-N is more likely to be converted to NO3\n\u2212-N by microorganisms in the presence of high level of oxygen in the environment (Canfield et al., 2010), a large amount of NO3\n\u2212-N was produced in both CK and CK+Biochar treatments in the early stage of composting (Figure 2D). However, addition of biochar increased the porosity of the pile and promoted air flow, resulting in the rapid conversion of NH4\n+-N in the CK+Biochar treatment, compared with that in the CK treatment. The NO3\n\u2212-N content in both CK and CK+Biochar treatments reached the maximum level on day 10, presenting 62.34% and 163.70% increase, respectively, which indicated that biochar could facilitate the vital activity of nitrifying bacteria. This effect of biochar might be caused by the specific pore structure of the biochar and the adsorption sites on its surface, which are beneficial to the adsorption of NH3 and NH4\n+, and provide a suitable environment for the metabolic activities of nitrifying bacteria. After 10\u00a0days of composting, the NO3\n\u2212-N content began to decrease after reaching its peak, possibly as a result of increase in the proportion of denitrifying bacteria, which promote the conversion of NO3\n\u2212-N to N2 and N2O (C\u00e1ceres et al., 2018). Moreover, the temperature of the pile gradually increased to 70\u00b0C at this stage, which inhibited the activity of nitrifying bacteria. However, in the maturity stage of composting, the NO3\n\u2212-N content in both CK and CK+Biochar treatments increased owing to the recovery of nitrifying bacterial activity as a result of decrease in temperature (Zainudin et al., 2020).", "At the end of composting, the GI value was used to evaluate the final compost products. The GI values of the final compost products of the CK and CK+Biochar treatments were 106.82% and 171.88%, respectively. GI value above 80% implies that the final compost products are fully mature without phytotoxicity (Huang et al., 2006). The results of the present study showed that biochar addition increased the GI value and improved the quality of the final compost products.", "3.3 Dynamic changes in the bacterial communities during composting", "As shown in Figure 3A, bacterial communities evolved during the composting process. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the predominant bacterial phyla, accounting for 57.59%\u201397.16% of the total bacterial community, with Firmicutes being the major bacterial phylum in the early stage of composting. From days 1 to 21, the temperature of the CK and CK+Biochar treatments mostly remained above 50\u00b0C and Firmicutes were dominant in both the treatments, indicating that these bacteria could survive at high temperatures. Firmicutes play a key role in cellulose degradation (Lebuhn et al., 2014), and can decompose corn straw in the early stage of composting and accelerate maturation of the compost. At the genus level, Romboutsia, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Terrisporobacter, and Turicibacter were predominant Firmicutes in both the treatments (Figure 3B). After 21\u00a0days of composting, the abundance of Firmicutes gradually declined, probably owing to the decrease in pile temperature, which was not suitable for the survival of most of the Firmicutes.", "FIGURE 3\n(A) Relative abundance of microorganisms at phylum level. (B) Abundance heat map of the top 35 microorganisms at genus level in different composting stages.", "(A) Relative abundance of microorganisms at phylum level. (B) Abundance heat map of the top 35 microorganisms at genus level in different composting stages.", "It can be observed from Figure 3A that Actinobacteria accounted for a relatively low proportion in the total bacterial community from days 1 to 21, because the high temperature in the early stage of composting could have inhibited the metabolic activities of Actinobacteria, which are thermosensitive microorganisms (Zhu et al., 2017b). However, during the maturity stage of composting, the temperature of the pile gradually decreased, and the activity of Actinobacteria increased, resulting in a slow increase in their proportion in the total bacterial community. At the genus level, Brevibacterium, Microbacterium, Brachybacterium, Georgenia, Longispora, Saccharomonospora, and Corynebacterium were the predominant Actinobacteria (Figure 3B), with Brevibacterium, Microbacterium, and Brachybacterium accounting for the highest proportion and presenting variation trend similar to that of Actinobacteria during composting. Furthermore, the abundance of Actinobacteria in the CK+Biochar treatment was higher than that in the CK treatment, with Brevibacterium, Microbacterium, and Brachybacterium being the dominant genera. These results demonstrated that the presence of biochar in the later composting stage stimulated the activity of Actinobacteria. When compared with the CK treatment, the low water content and faster water dissipation rate in the CK+Biochar treatment led to higher activity of Actinobacteria, because Actinobacteria are capable of generating spores to survive under low water condition (Zhou et al., 2019).", "Throughout the composting process, the abundance of Bacteroidetes showed the opposite trend in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments (Figure 3A). On day 1, the abundance of Bacteroidetes in the CK+Biochar treatment (14.61%) was higher than that in the CK treatment (2.42%). However, in the first 6\u00a0days of composting, the abundance of Bacteroidetes gradually decreased in the two treatments, owing to the high pile turnover frequency. Bacteroidetes are anaerobic microorganisms, and oxygen supplementation can reduce their metabolic activities (L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2021). The decrease in the abundance of Bacteroidetes in the CK+Biochar treatment was higher than that in the CK treatment, because biochar improved the pore structure of the pile and promoted the reaction of microorganisms to air contact. Bacteroides, Moheibacter, and Proteiniphilum belong to the phylum Bacteroidetes, and are the most sensitive to oxygen. In particular, Moheibacter was active during the highest temperature period (6\u201314\u00a0days), probably because of its thermophilic characteristic. At the end of the composting, the abundance of Bacteroidetes in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments was 47.56% and 0.86%, respectively, and this difference mainly occurred in the maturity stage. During the maturity stage of composting, the abundance of Bacteroidetes in the CK treatment increased, whereas that in the CK+Biochar treatment sharply decreased, especially in the last 8\u00a0days of composting, which was predominantly owing to the changes in the abundances of Anseongella and Membranicola (Figure 3B).", "Although the abundance of Proteobacteria gradually increased in both CK and CK+Biochar treatments in the early stage of composting, the reproduction rate and abundance of Proteobacteria was higher in the CK+Biochar treatment. It has been reported that Proteobacteria have a key role in nitrogen transformation processes such as oxidation of ammonia in compost (Maeda et al., 2011). Thus, the NH4\n+-N content in the CK+Biochar treatment rapidly decreased in the early stage of composting, whereas the NO3\n\u2212-N content was higher (Figure 2). In the later stage of composting, the higher abundance of Proteobacteria led to higher NO3\n\u2212-N content in the CK treatment.", "3.4 Changes in antibiotics contents during composting", "Figure 4 presents the changes of tetracyclines (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC), CTC, doxycycline (DOX), sulfonamides (SD, SMR), fluoroquinolones [ofloxacin (OFX), ciprofloxacin (CIP), difloxacin (DIF), danofloxacin (DAN), enrofloxacin (ENR)], macrolides [tilmicosin (TILM), tylosin (TYL)], and lincosamides (lincomycin (LCM)) antibiotics during composting in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments. At the end of composting, the total antibiotics removal rates in the CK and CK + Biochar treatments were 69.58% and 78.67%, respectively. The antibiotics removal mainly occurred in the early stage of composting (1\u201314\u00a0days), and the total antibiotics removal rates in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments were 64.24% and 71.84%, respectively. At the same time, temperature had a significant negative correlation with TC, OTC, CTC, DC, SD, SMR, OFX, CIP, ENR, TYL, TILM, and LCM concentration in the first 14\u00a0days of composting (Table 2), indicating that the increase in temperature was beneficial to antibiotics removal. This finding is consistent with that reported in previous studies, which revealed that high temperature could promote the degradation of antibiotics (Arikan et al., 2007; Dorival-Garc\u00eda et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015). The addition of biochar accelerated the increase in pile temperature, and consequently, the antibiotics removal rate in the CK+Biochar treatment was higher in the early stage of composting.", "FIGURE 4Concentration of antibiotics in different periods of composting.", "Concentration of antibiotics in different periods of composting.", "Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient between temperature and antibiotics at 1\u201314\u00a0days of composting.", "TC OTC CTC DOX SD SMR OFX CIP DIF DAN ENR TYL TILM LCM.", "T \u22120.868* \u22120.967** \u22120.951** \u22120.837* \u22120.349 \u22120.934** \u22120.952** \u22120.938** \u22120.901* \u22120.703 \u22120.869* \u22120.883* \u22120.967** \u22120.836*.", "*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.", "During the first 6\u00a0days of composting, 50.93%, 74.77%, 63.85% 66.13%, and 95.82% of TC, OTC, CTC, DOX, and TILM were removed in the CK+Biochar treatment, respectively, which were higher than those noted in the CK treatment (30.53%, 58.70%, 50.79%, 21.00%, and 68.28%, respectively). Biodegradation is an important pathway for the removal of tetracyclines antibiotics during pig manure composting (Wang et al., 2015). It must be noted that tetracyclines antibiotics are easily adsorbed by the medium in the environment (Tolls, 2001; Thiele-Bruhn and Beck, 2005), and addition of biochar, which has a rich pore structure and large number of binding sites, can facilitate the adsorption of tetracyclines antibiotics on the biochar surface and pores, and enhance the degradation of tetracyclines antibiotics by microorganisms adhering to the biochar. During 1\u201314\u00a0days of composting, the TYL removal rates in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments were 77.08% and 94.44%, respectively. TYL and TILM are amphoteric compounds with positive charges, which can form ion bonds with negatively charged components, such as the biochar surface, during composting (Tan et al., 2020); as a result, their removal was accelerated with biochar addition. At the end of composting, the removal rates of SD, SMR, OFX, CIP, DIF, and LCM in the CK treatment were 55.88%, 77.10%, 48.65%, 52.86%, 38.21%, and 40.23%, respectively, which were lower than those noted in the CK+Biochar treatment (68.32%, 84.75%, 87.24%, 64.73%, 62.55%, and 66.40%, respectively). In the presence of organic matter, high temperatures can lead to the production of more adsorption sites, decreasing the extractable concentration of sulfonamides antibiotics (Ezzariai et al., 2018). Biochar addition can inhibit the production of CO2 and reduce the loss of organic matter (Liu et al., 2017), thereby promoting the removal of sulfonamides in pig manure. The molecular structure of quinolone antibiotics comprises a large number of carboxyl, amino, and aromatic rings, which are easily adsorbed by humus (K\u00fcmmerer, 2009). At the end of composting, the total humic acid contents of CK and CK + Biochar treatments increased by 24.16% (from 62.02\u00a0g/kg to 77.01\u00a0g/kg) and 47.96% (from 64.78\u00a0g/kg to 95.85\u00a0g/kg), respectively. Biochar promotes the formation of humus during composting. Biodegradation is considered to be the main mechanism of LCM degradation (Alexandrino et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2018) and biochar can adsorb LCM for more than 200\u00a0days, exhibiting strong adsorption performance (Liu et al., 2019), which facilitates biodegradation of LCM. Bacillus, Saccharomonospora, and Georgenia presented significant negative correlations with TC, DOX, SD, SMR, DIF, TYL, and LCM concentrations (Supplementary Figure S4), indicating that these microorganisms can degrade antibiotics. Addition of biochar improved the activity of these microorganisms, thereby promoting the degradation of antibiotics during composting. In CK and CK+Biochar treatments, the concentration of DAN increased from 28.47 to 32.00\u00a0\u03bcg/kg and 23.49 to 32.32\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, and the concentration of ENR increased from 82.50 to 105.49\u00a0\u03bcg/kg and 68.06 to 146.32\u00a0\u03bcg/kg. Actinobacteria is considered to be the main producer of antibiotics (D'Costa et al., 2006), and Microbacterium and Brachybacterium, which belong to the phylum Actinobacteria, were significantly positively correlated with DAN and ENR concentrations, and their growth and reproduction during composting led to an increase in DAN and ENR concentrations. The results of this study revealed the high efficiency of antibiotic removal from co-composting of pig manure and corn straw with biochar. The removal rates of macrolide antibiotics were higher than that of other antibiotics at the early composting stage due to the differences in the types and chemical structures of antibiotics. Moreover, microorganisms are also important factors affecting the change of antibiotic concentration during composting.", "3.5 Dynamic variations in antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements during composting", "3.5.1 Changes in the absolute abundance of antibiotic resistance genes during composting", "Figure 5 shows the changes in the absolute abundance of ARGs (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and lincosamides resistance genes) during composting. On day 1, biochar addition increased the absolute abundance of ARGs, similar to that reported in a previous study (Zhou et al., 2021). The reason for the increase in the absolute abundance of ARGs following biochar addition may be the higher abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, the major host bacteria of ARGs (Stegmann et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2017), in the CK+Biochar treatment, when compared with those in the CK treatment. However, with the progress in the composting process, the absolute abundance of the total ARGs increased by 81.24 times in the CK treatment, which was higher than that noted in the CK+Biochar treatment (0.48 times), indicating that biochar addition was beneficial to inhibit the increase in the absolute abundance of ARGs.", "FIGURE 5Absolute abundance of ARGs in different periods of composting.", "Absolute abundance of ARGs in different periods of composting.", "After 50\u00a0days of composting, the absolute abundance of tetracycline resistance genes changed in varying degrees of changes. In the CK treatment, only tetO abundance decreased by 49.63% after the composting process because anaerobic bacteria are the major hosts of this ARG (Wang et al., 2015), whereas the absolute abundances of the other nine tetracycline resistance genes increased at varying degrees, with tetA and tetM presenting the highest and lowest increase in abundance, respectively (3.63\u00d7103 and 1.52 times, respectively). In contrast, in the CK+Biochar treatment, the absolute abundances of tetM, tetO, tetW, and tetX decreased by 92.83%, 46.30%, 24.15%, and 57.86%, respectively, whereas those of tetA, tetC, tetG, and tetZ increased by 7.8, 0.4, 11.6, and 500 times, respectively, and tetB and tetQ were undetectable after the composting process. These findings indicated that biochar addition led to higher removal of tetracycline resistance genes from the compost products.", "The absolute abundances of sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 increased by 3.80\u00d7103 and 6.56 \u00d7 103 times, respectively, in the CK treatment, and 33.95 and 4.06 times, respectively, in the CK+Biochar treatment, revealing that biochar addition to the composting system significantly decreased sul1 and sul2 abundances, predominantly after 42\u00a0days of composting. Similarly, Guo et al. (2021) also found that ARGs were mainly removed in the mature stage of pig manure composting.", "The fluoroquinolones resistance genes, gyrA and qnrS, were not detected in the final product of the CK treatment, whereas their absolute abundances decreased by 54.02% and 22.05%, respectively, in the CK+Biochar treatment, indicating that biochar addition might have promoted the growth and reproduction of bacteria possessing gyrA and qnrS. The absolute abundance of macrolide and lincosamide resistance genes in the CK treatment increased at varying degrees at the end of the composting process, with ermF and ermC presenting the highest and lowest increase of 2.54\u00d7103 and 5.12 times, respectively. In the CK+Biochar treatment, the absolute abundances of ermB and mefA decreased at the end of composting, with their removal rates reaching 90.77% and 53.51%, respectively, whereas those of ermC, ermF, ermT, and mphA increased with the progress of the composting process.", "In summary, biochar addition to the composting system promoted the removal of ARGs by prolonging and maintaining the duration of high-temperature period, which resulted in the killing of some heat-sensitive bacteria possessing ARGs. As shown in Figure 5, the absolute abundance of ARGs in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments gradually increased after the start of composting, which could be owing to elevated temperatures facilitating increase in the activities of Firmicutes that carry and spread ARGs (Huerta et al., 2013). Addition of biochar promoted ARGs removal in the later stages of composting (42\u201350\u00a0days), due to the decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. It has been reported that additional carbon sources can lead to a transient increase in the abundance of ARGs, followed by a decrease (Duan et al., 2018), and can degrade antibiotics, eliminate pathogens, and reduce the diversity and relative abundance of ARGs.", "3.5.2 Changes in the absolute abundance of mobile genetic elements during composting", "As HGT is considered to be an important mechanism for the spread and proliferation of ARGs in various environmental media (Thomas and Nielsen, 2005), the present study explored the changes in the absolute abundances of intI1 and intI2 during pig manure composting (Table 3). At the end of the composting process, the absolute abundance of intI1 in the CK and CK+Biochar treatments increased by 3.48 \u00d7 107 and 6.69 \u00d7 104 times, respectively. It has been reported that biochar addition could inhibit the increase in intI1 abundance during composting (Li et al., 2017). The absolute abundance of intI2 showed the opposite trend, presenting an increase of 1.51 \u00d7 105 times in the CK treatment and a decrease of 34.75% in the CK + Biochar treatment. Biochar contains a large number of micropores (Supplementary Figure S2B), which can enhance the spatial distance between microorganisms and reduce the possibility of mutual contact between microorganisms. As HGT of ARGs mainly occurs through interaction between microorganisms (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2015), biochar could reduce the occurrence of HGT, resulting in the removal of ARGs. In the present study, a significant positive correlation was observed between intI1 and intI2 and most of the ARGs during the composting process, indicating that intI1 and intI2 played an important role in the spread of ARGs.", "Absolute abundance of MGEs in different periods of composting.", "MGEs int I1 (copies/g) int I2 (copies/g).", "Time (d)/Treatment CK CK + Biochar CK CK + Biochar.", "1 1.08E+05 \u00b1 1.50E+04 2.96E+05 \u00b1 2.74E+04 1.18E+05 \u00b1 1.81E+04 8.49E+05 \u00b1 1.34E+05.", "6 9.08E+09 \u00b1 1.81E+09 2.60E+11 \u00b1 1.99E+10 5.22E+05 \u00b1 5.97E+04 3.39E+06 \u00b1 8.49E+05.", "14 1.38E+10 \u00b1 3.27E+09 1.37E+08 \u00b1 3.20E+07 1.33E+06 \u00b1 5.89E+05 2.37E+06 \u00b1 4.84E+05.", "21 1.68E+10 \u00b1 5.62E+09 2.28E+10 \u00b1 3.52E+09 1.51E+06 \u00b1 5.94E+05 5.33E+06 \u00b1 1.01E+06.", "28 2.11E+10 \u00b1 5.58E+08 4.21E+11 \u00b1 1.94E+10 2.25E+06 \u00b1 7.94E+05 1.40E+08 \u00b1 5.13E+06.", "42 5.31E+06 \u00b1 6.57E+06 8.08E+11 \u00b1 1.12E+11 0.00E+00 4.21E+07 \u00b1 9.03E+05.", "50 3.76E+12 \u00b1 2.62E+11 1.98E+10 \u00b1 4.36E+09 1.78E+08 \u00b1 1.43E+07 5.54E+05 \u00b1 3.00E+03.", "3.6 Relationship between potential host bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements", "Network analysis was used in this study to determine the potential host bacteria of ARGs and MGEs (Figure 6). A total of 24 genus-level bacteria were significantly associated with 20 ARGs and 2 MGEs (p < 0.05). It has been reported that a significant positive correlation between ARGs and bacterial communities could provide new insights into the potential host bacteria of ARGs (Zhu et al., 2017a). A total of 24 bacterial genera, belonging to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Halanaerobiaeota, were found to be potential host bacteria of ARGs and MGEs. Lactobacillus was observed to be a potential host of gyrA and tetM, and the removal of gyrA and tetM during the composting process could be attributed to the decrease in the abundance of Lactobacillus, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies suggesting that Lactobacillus is a potential host of ARGs (Bonham et al., 2017). As the host bacteria of tetZ are Brachybacterium, Saccharomonospora, Microbacterium, and Brevibacterium, the increase in the abundance of tetZ was mainly owing to the proliferation of these four bacteria. These results showed that ARGs existed in various possible host bacteria, which is consistent with the previously reported findings that indicated that the succession of bacterial communities led to variations in ARGs abundance (Sun et al., 2018). Furthermore, Parapedobacter, Anseongella, Georgenia, Pusillimonas, Galbibacter, Membranicola, Alcanivorax, Longispora, Saccharomonospora, and Sphingobacterium were noted to carry more ARGs and MGEs (at least five or more ARGs and MEGs), with Parapedobacter possessing 12 kinds of ARGs and MGEs. Besides, the hosts of some ARGs were not only one type of bacteria, but a variety of bacteria; for instance, tetG was found to have as many as nine potential host bacteria. The correlation between ARGs and different potential hosts varied, which was mainly related to the spread of ARGs among bacteria through HGT (Forsberg et al., 2014). The use of multiple antibiotics can lead to the emergence of multi-resistant microorganisms.", "FIGURE 6Network analysis based on co-occurrence of ARGs, MGEs, and their potential host bacteria.

The thicker the line is, the stronger is the positive correlation.", "Network analysis showed that intI1 and intI2 have the same potential hosts, namely, Parapedobacter, Alcanivorax, Pusillimonas, Anseongella, and Membranicola (Figure 6). These bacteria were significantly associated with a variety of ARGs (p < 0.05) and were the hub of ARGs for HGT, consistent with that reported in a previous study suggesting that MGEs are associated with multidrug resistance genes (Jechalke et al., 2014b). The variations in the abundances of intI1 and intI2 during the composting process were strongly affected by bacterial communities, which also supported the view that the changes in the bacterial communities could affect the proliferation and propagation of ARGs.", "3.7 Relationships among environmental factors, antibiotics, bacterial community, antibiotic resistance genes, and mobile genetic elements", "RDA was used to determine the effects of environmental factors on antibiotics, ARGs, MGEs, and bacterial communities during the composting process (Figure 7). The first two axes (RDA1 and RDA2) explained 57.31% of the changes in the bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and MGEs during composting. Among the environmental factors selected in this study, DTN and NH4\n+-N presented the highest contribution of 22.60% and 21.80%, respectively, and showed significant correlation with Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (p < 0.05). This result is consistent with the findings of a previous study that demonstrated that nitrogen content is closely related to microbial growth (Chen et al., 2014). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was observed between DTN and NH4\n+-N contents and tetracyclines antibiotics, sulfonamides antibiotics, OFX, CIP, DIF, macrolides antibiotics, and LCM, indicating that biochar addition facilitated antibiotics removal from swine manure by promoting DTN utilization and NH4\n+-N transformation by microorganisms. In contrast, a significant negative correlation was noted between DTN and sul1 as well as NH4\n+-N and sul1, sul2, tetA, and tetG (Supplementary Figure S3), which could explain the observed increase in the absolute abundance of sul1, sul2, tetA, and tetG during the composting process. Furthermore, OM, MC, DOC, TOC, and C/N exhibited significant correlations with some antibiotics, ARGs, and microorganisms, indicating that the changes in the environmental factors were critical to the composting process (Supplementary Figure S3).", "FIGURE 7RDA of the relationship between environmental factors (red arrows) and ARGs, MGEs (blue arrows), antibiotics (purple arrows), and phylum-level bacteria (green arrows) during composting.", "RDA of the relationship between environmental factors (red arrows) and ARGs, MGEs (blue arrows), antibiotics (purple arrows), and phylum-level bacteria (green arrows) during composting.", "To further explore how antibiotics and ARGs were affected by other driving factors in the composting process, the direct and indirect relationships between different variables were examined by establishing a SEM (Figure 8). The results showed that the composting properties (\u03bb = 0.663, p < 0.001) and community composition (\u03bb = 0.250, p < 0.05) had significant effects on the variations in the antibiotics levels during composting. The composting properties were the dominant factors that determined the degradation status of antibiotics. Moreover, the variations in the ARGs abundances during composting were mainly influenced by antibiotics, bacterial community composition, and MGEs, with MGEs (\u03bb = 0.692, p < 0.001) being the highest contributor to the changes in ARGs, followed by antibiotics (\u03bb = \u22120.228, p < 0.05) and bacterial community composition (\u03bb = \u22120.194, p < 0.05). This finding is consistent with those reported in previous studies that demonstrated that the contribution of MGEs to changes in ARGs was higher than that of bacterial community composition during composting (Ma et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017). The effect of composting properties on ARGs was mainly indirect via the influence of antibiotics (\u03bb = 0.663, p < 0.001), bacterial community composition (\u03bb = 0.414, p < 0.01), and HGT dominated by MGEs (\u03bb = \u22120.757, p < 0.01) on the changes in ARGs during composting. Moreover, addition of biochar, directly and indirectly, affected the changes in antibiotics and ARGs during composting by altering the composting properties.", "FIGURE 8\n(A) SEM reflecting direct and indirect relationships between compost physicochemical properties, antibiotics, bacterial communities, MGEs, and ARGs.
