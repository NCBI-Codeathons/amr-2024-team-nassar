["Discussion and conclusion", "After decades of hard work and several researches, now, immunotherapy has become a reality, an effective treatment for treating lung carcinoma, and to eradicate cancer cells. Blockade of immune checkpoints has transformed lung cancer treatment. They have proven themselves more efficacious than the standard of care chemotherapeutic treatment. This treatment treats not only NSCLC but also SCLC in its extensive stage (either in the form of monotherapy or in combination). However, like other anti-cancer drugs, they have adverse effects (71). The adverse effects associated with immunotherapy are as a result of inflammation in response to immune hyperactivation. These adverse events are collectively termed as the immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Four probable mechanisms have been described for irAEs, but the exact pathophysiology involved in these events is unknown. The enhancement of preexisting antibody levels due to modulation of humoral immunity, the cross reactivity of T cells because of similar antigen, increase in the number of inflammatory cytokines, and the complement-mediated inflammation enhancement are the possible mechanisms leading toward the adverse events due to immunotherapy (72). For example, CTLA-4 inhibition can cause inflammation of colon, whereas PD-1 inhibition leads to pneumonitis that can be fatal. Because patients with lung cancer usually have low lung reserve due to current or past smoking history, pneumonitis is a particular concern in this population. Pneumonitis can thereby further worsen an already inadequate lung reserve and, in extreme situations, even result in death. Despite this worry, pneumonitis is an uncommon occurrence. In case of severe adverse effects, it is necessary to stop the immunotherapy or treatment with corticosteroid is essential (73). The meta-analysis on nivolumab by Zhao et\u00a0al. proved a low risk of adverse effects when compared with the chemotherapy; however, some of them can be fatal and cannot be ignored (74).", "Keeping in view their benefits in treating lung carcinoma, their future either in combination or as monotherapy seems to be bright in lung carcinoma. However, their true potential can be determined by additional studies with anti\u2013PD-1 receptors. The future research can be focused on determining the answers to questions such as determination of the mechanism of immunotherapy resistance. Although the road to effective immunotherapy for lung cancer has not been easy, both animal and human researches have taught us important insights. Thanks to a greater understanding of lung cancer immunoescape and immunosubversion, together with cancer immunosurveillance, immunoediting, and methods to reawaken cancer immunity, we may now embark on a future full of possibilities in using immunotherapy as effective lung cancer treatment."]
