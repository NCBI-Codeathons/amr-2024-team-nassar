["Discussion", "Poisonous organisms that use toxins as defensive molecules must avoid autointoxication. Such resistance has been proposed to arise from three strategies: (1) acquisition of target protein toxin resistance mutations, (2) toxin sequestration, and (3) enhanced detoxification or elimination capacity (Almabruk et al., 2018; Arbuckle et al., 2017). Support for the first mechanism includes prominent examples of TTX-resistant NaVs in toxin-bearing species and their predators (Hanifin and Gilly, 2015; Jost et al., 2008; Geffeney et al., 2002; Geffeney et al., 2005; McGlothlin et al., 2016), STX-resistant NaVs in mollusks (Bricelj et al., 2005), and epibatidine-resistant nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in poison frogs (Tarvin et al., 2017). Because of these examples and the suggestion that the NaV DIVS6 N\u2192T mutation might confer BTX resistance to poison frogs (Wang and Wang, 2017), we expected to find toxin-resistant mutants in poison bird and frog NaVs. Instead, we found multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that NaVs from both poison birds and frogs are highly sensitive to BTX and lack the DIVS6 N\u2192T change. Furthermore, even though the DIVS6 N\u2192T mutation alters the BTX responses of bird, human, and rat NaV1.4s (Fig. 3, a\u2013d; and Fig. S5, a\u2013d), it failed to have any effect on the BTX sensitivity of poison frog NaVs (Fig. 3, e\u2013h), a result that highlights the importance of vetting putative toxin resistance mutations in the context of the native channel (Tarvin et al., 2017).", "How amino acid changes compensate for mutations that alter function is complex and can arise from effects at positions that are far apart in the protein structure (Thomas et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2002; Bigman and Levy, 2020; Tokuriki et al., 2008). There are >90 amino acid differences between the poison frog and human NaV1.4s (Fig. 2 and Table S2), and it is not obvious which variants in the frog NaVs suppress the ability of DIVS6 N\u2192T to affect BTX responses. The importance of context is further evident from the fact that even though the Asn position is conserved in all four NaV pore domain subunits, the functional consequences of the N\u2192T change are domain dependent (Fig. 4 and Table 2). These factors, together with the absence of DIVS6 N\u2192T in BTX-bearing birds and frogs (Figs. S1 and S2; M\u00e1rquez et al., 2019; Tarvin et al., 2016) and its ineffectiveness in poison frog NaVs, rule out the target alteration hypothesis for BTX resistance.", "Endowing a protein with a new function through mutation often incurs a cost, particularly with respect to protein stability (Wang et al., 2002; Bigman and Levy, 2020; Tokuriki et al., 2008). Our data show that the DIVS6 N\u2192T change in bird, human, rat, and frog NaVs carries substantial functional costs that affect every aspect of channel function by inducing changes that render the channels more difficult to open and more readily inactivated and that reduce current density (Table 2), an effect that likely reflects stability penalties that impact channel biogenesis (Baroudi et al., 2002; Sol\u00e9 and Tamkun, 2020; Mercier et al., 2017). These severe pleiotropic functional consequences are in line with the role of this conserved Asn site in coupling the pore to the voltage sensor domain in NaVs (Sheets et al., 2015). Similar perturbations of NaV inactivation and reduction of current levels have profound physiological consequences (Chen et al., 2002) and are linked to a variety of channelopathies (Loussouarn et al., 2016), underscoring the organism-level fitness problems incurred by changes in NaV biophysical properties. These substantial fitness costs, as well as the inability of the DIVS6 N\u2192T mutation to affect the BTX responses of poison frog NaVs, are consistent with the low frequency of this variant in P. terribilis (M\u00e1rquez et al., 2019) and its absence from the BTX-bearing P. aurotaenia poison frog (Tarvin et al., 2016). Other studies of ion channel toxin resistance mutants have uncovered various degrees of functional costs that may be compensated by amino acid changes at additional sites in the channel (Lee et al., 2011; Tarvin et al., 2017). Hence, the effectiveness of developing a toxin-resistant channel via mutation is highly dependent on the cost for evolving this new function and the extent to which functional costs can be mitigated by additional changes.", "Poison frogs lacking the NaV1.4 DIVS6 N\u2192T change withstand BTX levels that affect nonpoisonous frogs (Fig. 5 and Table S3), in line with previous studies (Daly et al., 1980). In nonpoisonous frogs, we find clear in vivo physiological antagonism between the channel blocker, tricaine, and the channel opener, BTX. This result indicates that both compounds access their target NaVs. By contrast, this antagonism is absent in poison frogs (Fig. 5 and Table S3), even though it can occur at the molecular level of the channel (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the resistance of poison frogs to BTX and STX contrasts with the effects of TTX and is not consistent with the high sensitivity of their NaV1.4s to all three toxins (Fig. 1, e\u2013h; Fig. 5; and Fig. 7). Together these observations suggest that poison frogs have a means to prevent BTX and STX engaging the target NaVs. It is notable that other frogs resist STX poisoning (Prinzmetal et al., 1932; Kao and Fuhrman, 1967; Mahar et al., 1991), and it is thought that the soluble STX-binding protein Sxph (Mahar et al., 1991; Arbuckle et al., 2017; Yen et al., 2019) acts as a toxin sponge to sequester and neutralize the lethal effects of this and possibly other neurotoxins (Mahar et al., 1991; Llewellyn et al., 1997; Arbuckle et al., 2017; Almabruk et al., 2018; Caty et al., 2019; O\u2019Connell et al., 2021).", "If BTX-bearing animals do not use BTX-resistant NaVs to avoid autointoxication, how do they survive? Apart from the absence of BTX-resistant NaVs, the diversity among >800 poison frog alkaloid toxins (Daly et al., 2005), the seasonal and geographical variation of these toxins, and their ability to affect multiple ion channels (Santos et al., 2016) pose major challenges for evolving toxin-resistant channels. Enhanced detoxification via metabolic toxin destruction would not be useful, because these poisonous organisms need to handle and store the toxins to deploy them against predators. By contrast, sequestration strategies not only offer a general means of toxin protection but also could act in pathways involved in safely transporting and concentrating toxins in key defensive organs such as the skin (Menon and Dumbacher, 2014). The fact that toxin-based chemical defense systems have evolved independently four times in neotropical poison frogs (Dendrobatids; Santos et al., 2016), in Malagasy poison frogs (Garraffo et al., 1993), and in multiple lineages of poisonous birds (including Pitohui and Ifrita; Dumbacher et al., 1992; Dumbacher et al., 2000) supports the idea that such general sequestration mechanisms may underlie toxin autoresistance. Furthermore, there are a number of examples of poison frogs (Tarvin et al., 2016; M\u00e1rquez et al., 2019) and predators of toxic animals (Feldman et al., 2016) that lack toxin-resistant mutations, raising questions about the generality of the target-based mechanism. Although no BTX-binding proteins have yet been identified, high-affinity toxin-binding proteins for STX in frogs, Sxph (Llewellyn et al., 1997; Mahar et al., 1991; Yen et al., 2019), and STX and TTX in pufferfish, pufferfish STX- and TTX-binding protein, PSTBP (Yotsu-Yamashita et al., 2001; Yotsu-Yamashita et al., 2010), are known and have been proposed to prevent autointoxication through sequestration (Arbuckle et al., 2017). We show that one of these proteins, Sxph, is able not only to protect NaVs from toxin poisoning but also to reverse the action of a high-affinity toxin, STX, on frog NaVs (Fig. 8), a result that underscores the potential for such toxin sponge proteins to act as agents of toxin resistance. Characterizing how such toxin-binding proteins protect hosts from autointoxication, alone or together with specialized toxin transport pathways, should provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of toxin autoresistance and expand understanding of how organisms handle a range of chemical insults and may lead to the discovery of antidotes against various toxic agents."]
