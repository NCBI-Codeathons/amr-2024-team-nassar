["3. Discussion", "Identification of BGCs in Streptomyces genomes is mostly performed using the antiSMASH bioinformatics tool [6,7,8]. However, this and other bioinformatics tools have been developed based on current knowledge of BGCs, which hampers the discovery of novel families of BGCs [36]. In this work, we have used an alternative approach to identify a novel BGC in S. argillaceus, consisting in seeking SARP encoding genes in its genome and analyzing their surrounding DNA region. In this way, we have been able to identify the new ahb BGC, which had not been retrieved using antiSMASH. This strategy could be used as an additional tool to uncover unknown BGCs. The ahb cluster is silent under standard laboratory culture conditions, and is highly preserved in several Streptomyces strains, which suggests that their encoding compounds may play an important role when microbial strains face specific environmental conditions. Joint overexpression of three ahb regulatory genes (ahbR2, ahbR3, and ahbR4) allowed the activation of the ahb cluster and the identification of its encoded AHBs products. We have been able to purify and characterize the chemical structure of seven AHBs, all of them derived from 3,4-AHBA, including four new bicyclic compounds (AHB74, AHB76, AHB77, and AHB118); two acylated 3,4-AHBA (AHB119, also known as 3,4-AcAHBA [24]; and the new AHB120); and the phenoxazinone AHB75 (acetyl-APOC), also known as carboxyexfoliazone [28] or umycin A [29]. Moreover, by overexpressing three genes (ahbH, ahbI, and ahbL2) for the synthesis and activation of 3,4-AHBA, a new hybrid compound, AHB18, was identified, containing a 3,4-AHBA moiety and an ARP bicyclic derivative constituted by a 2,3-dihydropiridine ring fused with a five-membered ring. This ARP moiety closely resembles those synthesized during the final steps of the ARP biosynthetic pathway [17,25,26]. Biosynthesis of AHB18 would result from a metabolic crosstalk between the AHB and the ARP pathways.", "As mentioned above, 3,4-AHBA is a building block present in different metabolites such as grixazone [24,34]. The biosynthetic pathway of the phenoxazinone grixazone A starts with the formation of 3,4-AHBA from two metabolites, aspartate semialdehyde (ASA) and dihydroxyacetone-P (DHAP), by an initial aldol condensation catalyzed by GriI to give rise to the acyclic 2-amino-4,5-dihydro-6-one-heptanoate-7-P, followed by a cyclodehydrative aromatization catalyzed by GriH [24]. Formation of 3,4-AHBA is followed by its conversion into an acyl-AMP intermediate by action of the AMP-binding protein GriC, and its reduction to 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzaldehide (3,4-AHBAL) mediated by GriD [37]. Afterwards, formation of the phenoxazinone backbone is preceded by the oxidation of 3,4-AHBAL to its quinone imine by the action of the phenoxazinone synthase GriF [38]. The AHBs biosynthetic pathway would follow similar initial steps as grixazone. The ahb cluster contains two genes, ahbI and ahbH, encoding enzymes with high similarity to fructose-biphosphate aldolases and 3-dehydroquinate synthases II, which would catalyze the initial steps leading to 3,4-AHBA (Figure 2). This would be adenylated by an AMP-binding protein. The ahb BGC encodes two acyl-CoA ligases (ahbL1 and ahbL2) that could be involved in adenylation of 3,4-AHBA. Since the 5\u2032-end of ahbL2 overlaps with the 3\u2032-end of ahbH, we propose AhbL2 for this role. As expected, the ahb cluster does not encode any homologous to GriD, since AHBs retain the carboxylic group in their molecules. Formation of bicyclic AHBs and the phenoxazinone AHB75 most likely would require the previous oxidation of 3,4-AHBA to its quinone imine, which would be coupled to another quinone imine unit to generate APOC, or to different carbon chains or an indole unit to generate the bicyclic AHBs (Figure 2). In the grixazone and in actinomycin biosynthesis pathways, the oxidation of the corresponding o-aminophenols is carried out by phenoxazinone synthases [38,39,40]. The ahb cluster lacks any gene encoding that type of enzyme. However, it contains several oxidoreductase coding genes that could be involved in this event. The existence of another acyl-CoA ligase AhbL1 and two kinases (AhbP1 and AhbP2) suggests that condensation of 3,4-AHBA to the different carbon chain and indole units might occur through adenylated or phosphorylated derivatives. Additionally, formation of APOC (precursor of AHB78) could also occur non-enzymatically, although probably more slowly, as it has been reported [38]. In addition, the cluster contains other genes such as methyltransferases, oxygenases, and oxidoreductases that could participate in the biosynthesis of the aliphatic side chains. Further studies will be required to determine the origin of such carbon chains and indole moiety and how they are incorporated to the quinone imine to generate the bicyclic AHBs. AHB119 and AHB120 would be shunt products of the pathway generated by incorporation of acyl groups. Additionally, in the case of AHB75, acylation would be the final steps in its biosynthesis. These acylations would involve acyltransferases. The ahb cluster does not contain any acyltransferase coding gene, which indicates that this gene would be in another region of the chromosome. Further studies would be required to clarify the biosynthetic steps downstream of 3,4-AHBA formation.", "Although the reported AHBs did not show antibiotic activity (except AHB75), the identification of the ahb genes opens the possibility to use those genes as tools to generate potentially new bioactive compounds by combinatorial biosynthesis. In this sense, we have recently reported a new hybrid antibiotic compound generated by combining genes from the arp and cpk clusters, which encode the non-bioactive compounds ARP and coelimycin P, respectively [26]."]
