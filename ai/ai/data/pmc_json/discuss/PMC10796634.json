["Discussion", "Ginsenosides are ubiquitous secondary metabolites found in Panax plants in species- and organ-specific manner. P. notoginseng plants use considerable resources to synthesize these ginsenosides, implying that the compounds have essential plant functions or benefits. Ginsenosides have attracted increasing attention in the past two decades due to their significant medicinal value, but few studies have focused on their roles in plant defence. In this study, we found that P. notoginseng has evolved a two-component chemical defence system composed of PnGH1, a glucosidase localized in chloroplasts, and PPD-type ginsenosides with \u03b2-1,2-glucosidic linkages at C-3. This two-component defence system might be crucial in chemical defence against fungal infection in P. notoginseng.", "The round spot is a primary foliar destructive disease occurring in cultured P. notoginseng caused by the necrotrophic fungus M. acerina27,28, leading to 50\u201390% yield loss27. In our study, the first indication that PPD-type ginsenosides have defensive properties against fungal infection was that ginsenoside hydrolysis was localized to the decayed tissue of PNLs with round spot disease. These findings were also confirmed in M. acerina-inoculated PNLs in the greenhouse. Nevertheless, a small quantity of hydrolysis products was detected in the leaves of non-infected plants and healthy tissue in the same and neighboring leaves, indicating that other unidentified factors or stresses might also cause mild ginsenoside hydrolysis in healthy PNLs under highly complex open-field conditions. However, upon fungal infection, intact ginsenosides are largely hydrolyzed in the decayed tissue of the PNLs. We further revealed that ginsenoside hydrolysis is a stress type-specific response associated with infection by pathogenic fungi, but absent in non-pathogenic fungal infection and designed abiotic stress. Dynamic chemical changes during fungal infection indicated that the molar amounts of the hydrolysis products in decayed PNLs increased dramatically, with increases ranging from 2.2-fold to 7.8-fold, suggesting that ginsenoside biosynthesis is enhanced to produce greater amounts of the hydrolysis products upon fungal infection. Fd, with the strongest antifungal activity, showed the most significant enrichment during the infection process. Gene expression profile analysis revealed that the expression of the key genes involved in the biosynthesis of ginsenosides and the \u03b2-glucosidase gene PnGH1 upregulated significantly after being infected by the necrotrophic fungus M. acerina (Supplementary Fig.\u00a022). Jasmonates (JAs) are a group of lipid-derived phytohormones that play an essential role in a variety of stress defence responses and plant growth29. Treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) effectively enhances Rb1, Rc, Rb2, and Rb3 biosynthesis by activating gene transcription related to ginsenoside biosynthesis in PNLs30. The content of Rg1, Re, Rb1, and Rd is significantly increased in P. notoginseng cell suspension cultures upon 2-hydroxyethyl jasmonate (HEJ) or MeJA treatment31. Thus, JAs are important signaling molecules that elicit ginsenoside biosynthesis in Panax. The inoculation with pathogenic fungi results in upregulating JA biosynthesis-related genes and JA signaling pathway genes in PNLs32. In our study, the enhanced ginsenoside biosynthesis during fungal infection might be attributed to the activation of the JA signaling cascade.", "Two-component defence systems involving several classes of specialized metabolites, including cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates, iridoids, benzoxazinoids, and triterpene saponins, have long been documented in other genera20,21. Triterpene saponins exert antifungal activity by inhibiting biofilm formation and disrupting the membrane integrity by forming saponin-sterol complex, acting as plant defence compounds20,33. Oat (Avena sativa) leaves accumulate non-active bisdesmosidic saponins that can be bio-activated by a specific \u03b2-glucosidase, avenacosidases, to exert their biocidal effects34. Recently, Lacchini et al. reported that Medicago truncatula, a model legume, has evolved a two-component chemical defence system composed of triterpene saponins and a nucleolar-localized \u03b2-glucosidase, acting as a saponin bomb21. Thus, the saponin bomb model might be a widespread two-component system in many plant species. However, such a system has never previously been reported for ginsenosides in Panax species. Less polar ginsenosides lead to increased antifungal activity, indicating the importance of sugar moieties in toxicity toward fungi35. Our data indicated that PnGH1-mediated hydrolysis products, either in the form of refined extracts or pure compounds, exhibited more potent broad-spectrum antifungal activity against phytopathogens both in vitro and in vivo than intact ginsenosides. Hydrolysis products with lower polarity might more easily cross the membrane and be enriched in the fungus to exert more potent fungicidal activity. Previous studies have indicated that triterpenoid saponins are localized in the cytoplasm8,36 or vacuoles21,37 of plant cells, but little information is available regarding ginsenoside localization in PNLs. The identified hydrolysis products with strong antimicrobial activity were consistent with the definition of phytoalexins, which are inducible specialized metabolites that are constitutively produced in response to biotic stresses.", "As bioactivating enzymes, \u03b2-glucosidases are often involved in such defence systems. In this study, PnGH1, a \u03b2-glucosidase with high enzyme stability and hydrolytic regiospecificity, was discovered in P. notoginseng and characterized. The kcat/KM value of PnGH1 (5.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009s\u22121\u2009\u00b5M\u22121 for Rb3) significantly surpasses that of MeLinamarase (0.0246\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009s\u22121\u2009\u00b5M\u22121 for linamarin)38, a cyanogenic \u03b2-glucosidase involved in plant defence through cyanogenesis mechanism against small herbivores, and are comparable in terms of magnitude to that of MtG1 (26.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009s\u22121\u2009\u00b5M\u22121 for 3-Glc-28-Glc-medicagenic acid)21, a triterpene saponin \u03b2-glucosidase involved in a two-component chemical defence system in M. truncatula. Modeling and mutagenesis studies suggested that PnGH1, belonging to the GH1 family, is a retaining \u03b2-glucosidase that hydrolyzes glycosidic bonds through a double displacement mechanism using two conserved carboxylic acid residues, E232 and E425, which serve as the catalytic acid/base and nucleophile, respectively. Thus far, PnGH1 appears to be a unique \u03b2-glucosidase that can hydrolyze an outer glucose from the \u03b2 (1\u2009\u2192\u20092)-glycosidic linkage at C-3 of PPD-type ginsenosides. PnGH1 is expressed abundantly in PNLs. The N-terminus of the PnGH1 protein contains a chloroplast transit peptide, which is consistent with the identified subcellular localization of PnGH1 in the chloroplast. Upon cellular disruption caused by an event such as a pathogen attack, toxic defence compounds are bioactivated by removing a glycosidic moiety catalyzed by \u03b2-glucosidase, which is spatially separated from protoxin substrates under physiological conditions.", "PnGH1 was shown to subcellularly localize to the chloroplast, which insulated it from its substrates in intact cells. This is a critical characteristic of a two-component defence system, which relies on the physical separation of \u03b2-glucosidase from protoxin substances. PnGH1 triggers hydrolysis upon cell disruption in fresh healthy PNLs, as demonstrated by a bead milling experiment. A similar result was found in an aqueous extract of dried PNLs following ultrasonication10,18, an efficient method for disrupting cell walls and membranes39. Furthermore, massive cell disruption can be elicited by fungal infection. Plant necrotrophic pathogens secrete a wide range of cell wall-degrading enzymes or exoenzymes to deconstruct the structural components of plant cells, facilitating penetration and colonization of host tissues25. Consistent with this, our data indicate that infection with M. acerina causes organelle disintegration and chloroplast architecture degradation in PNLs, as observed by TEM, resulting in the release of PnGH1 from the chloroplast. Mechanistically, the exoenzymes whose expression is induced by this fungus by PNL tissue and pectin contribute greatly to cell disruption, as evidenced by the observation that the symptoms, chloroplast ultrastructure, and chemical changes in the leaves treated with induced exoenzymes were similar to those caused by infection with M. acerina, although the exoenzymes from a broth culture of M. acerina failed to produce any lesions on the PNLs.", "In conclusion, this work clearly demonstrates a two-component defence system comprising the \u03b2-glucosidase PnGH1 and PPD-type ginsenosides in P. notoginseng (Fig.\u00a07). Similar ginsenoside hydrolysis was observed in pathogenic fungus-infected leaves of P. quinquefolium, and P. ginseng, and their responsible homologous \u03b2-glucosidases were also cloned and functionally identified. Our findings reveal a two-component chemical defence system in Panax species and offer insights for developing botanical pesticides for disease management in Panax species.Fig. 7Schematic illustration representing PnGH1-mediated ginsenoside hydrolysis in P. notoginseng leaves and its role in chemical defence against pathogenic phytopathogens.P. notoginseng has evolved a two-component defence system comprising the \u03b2-glucosidase PnGH1 and PPD-type ginsenosides.
