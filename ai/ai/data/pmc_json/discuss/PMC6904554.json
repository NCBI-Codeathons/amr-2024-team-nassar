["Discussion", "TMT-labeled nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a new quantitative method technology, overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods which can not quantify macromolecules and proteins30. This is the first application in the proteome study of hybrid bamboo under the stress of the pathogenic fungus A. phaeospermum. Plants evolve complex disease resistance mechanisms in their struggle against pathogenic fungi31. The expression of proteins related to plant disease resistance will change to complete signal sensing and transmission, which will lead to plant response mechanism. The formation of disease resistance in all plants is closely related to the change of protein quantity and function. Differential proteomics focuses on finding differences in protein expression between samples caused by specific factors, which can reveal changes in plant proteomes under specific physiological or pathological conditions. At present, the proteomics of plants infected by various pathogenic fungi have been studied. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana under the stress of Fusarium, the rice under the stress of Magnaporthe grisea32,33, the wheat under the stress of Fusarium graminearum34,35, the barley under Gibberella scab stress36, Brassica carinata under the stress of Phytophthora parasitica37, the cauliflower under Xanthomonas campestris stress38, the alfalfa under Aphanomyces euteiches stress were studied, and the differential proteomes were obtained and identified39\u201341. The expression of resistance-related proteins in those plants increased more or less. Combined the results of this study with the above studies, the expression of proteins related to disease resistance in hybrid bamboo infected by pathogenic fungus A. phaeospermum may increase, comparing with that in hybrid bamboo inoculated with sterile water. The results indicated that under the stress of the pathogenic fungi, the expression of proteins related to self-resistance would inevitably be affected during the growth of hybrid bamboo. This study will help to identify the key proteins of plant disease resistance, so as to formulate new strategies for disease prevention and control.", "On the other hand, 102 differentially expressed proteins were identified by TMT-labeled quantitative proteomics from hybrid bamboo treated with sterile water and A.phaeospermum, of which 66 were up-regulated and 36 were down-regulated. PRM targeted quantitative proteomics combined with LC-PRM/MS quantitative analysis was used to quantitatively analyze 11 differential candidate proteins. The TMT results of differential proteins Pyruvate phosphate dikinase (ID:PH01000011G2670), Alcohol dehydrogenase GroES-like domain (ID:PH01000043G2150), Peroxidase (ID:PH01000898G0600, PH01000761G0570), DnaJ domain (ID:PH01002240G0140), PEP/pyruvate binding domain (ID:PH01002248G0250), Indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (ID:PH01005469G0070), (ID: PH01100083G0010), Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (ID:PH01000137G0030), Clp protease (ID:PH01001219G0020) were consistent with the quantitative results of PRM. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the differentially up-regulated proteins of hybrid bamboo infected by pathogenic fungi were significantly enriched in the biological processes, cell components and molecular functions of GO database, compared with those of hybrid bamboo inoculated with sterile water. Differential proteins are mainly concentrated in monomer metabolism, redox and carboxylic acid metabolism. The cell components are mainly enriched in chloroplast and plastid components, and the molecular functions are mainly enriched in oxidoreductase activity, tetrapyrrole binding and heme binding. Previous studies have shown that the redox processes of wheat, Ligustrum lucidum, locust, jujube, poplar and sugar beet seedlings under drought stress are all affected, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the redox process have the role of signal molecules, which can regulate programmed cell death42\u201345. Chloroplast is the site of plant photosynthesis, which can produce a variety of reactive oxygen species46. It is suggested that there are a large number of proteins involved in physiological and biochemical processes such as redox in hybrid bamboo under the pathogenic fungi stress, which may be related to plant stress resistance. There were 102 differential proteins were annotated to different pathways in KEGG metabolic pathway enrichment analysis. These pathways included secondary metabolites synthesis (map01110), microbial metabolism in different environments (map01120), carbon metabolism (map01200) and amino acid biosynthesis (map01230). Previous studies have indicated that plant secondary metabolites such as phytoprotegerin, lignin and peroxidase can be used as biochemical barriers to resist pathogenic bacteria invasion and participate in signal transduction of plant disease resistance47\u201349. In addition, many substances in secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, flavonoids, ginkgolides and phenolics, play an important role in plant growth and development, physiological and biochemical metabolism, stress resistance and disease resistance50,51. For example, the content of isoflavones in alfalfa leaves increased after infected with Phytophthora spp52. Based on the above conclusions, the differential proteins of hybrid bamboo infected by the pathogenic fungus A. phaeospermum were significantly enriched in the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Because the cell wall degrading enzymes and debris produced by cell wall degradation may trigger the defense response of plants themselves, it can be inferred that the cell wall degrading enzymes are secreted by A. phaeospermum. Secreted proteins may cause changes in the expression of related proteins in hybrid bamboo in response to this process53. Among them, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in the up-regulation protein of hybrid bamboo infected by A. phaeospermum plays a key role in plant lignin synthesis, which can provide necessary strength, hydrophobicity and resistance to external pathogenic fungi54\u201356. Furthermore, the up-regulated protein cysteine protease belonging to the protease family causes programmed cell death in plant tissues under stress to resist pathogenic fungi infection57. Therefore, it is speculated that the differential proteins of hybrid bamboo inoculated with the pathogenic fungus A. phaeospermum are significantly enriched in redox process, secondary metabolite synthesis and amino acid synthesis, and there are proteins related to disease resistance of hybrid bamboo. At present, only the metabolic pathways of candidate disease-resistant proteins in hybrid bamboo have been studied, but the specific functions of these proteins need to be further verified."]
