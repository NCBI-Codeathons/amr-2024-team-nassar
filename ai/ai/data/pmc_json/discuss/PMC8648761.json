["Discussion", "Combining genetic characterization and biological investigation, we now filled in the missing intracellular events of a multi-dimensional temporal-spatial shielding mode for the self-resistance during THIQs biosynthesis in Streptomyces. The BGC encodes a major facilitator subfamily transporter presumably responsible for the antibiotic effluxes16,24,31, which was assumed as the first action conferring self-resistance. In addition, an UV-repair protein was considered as the second defense for the producer via nucleotide excision-based DNA repair16,24,32. In fact, both of the canonical mechanisms are necessary but seem not completely competent to the task to guarantee the harmlessness during the whole biosynthetic process. Thereby another cryptic self-defense strategy was evolved by integrating with the pathway to ensure the survival of host during the biosynthetic process, which includes two key enzymatic steps via reduction-oxidation occurring at different timing and location (Fig.\u00a07). In cytoplasm, SDRs (NapW/homW or SfmO1/homO1a/homO1b) will quench the reactive iminium intermediate immediately once it is generated by NRPS system via reduction of the C=N double bond to block the pharmacophore; which is a damage-control process because the resulted intermediates are totally harmless to the producer for deficiency of warhead. Subsequently, the matured but still inactivated intermediate 2 will be re-activated by secreted oxidase outside the host cells. Moreover, this secreted oxidase NapU could further oxidatively inactivate NDM into 3 to control the antibiotic concentration around the host cell (Fig.\u00a01c). Despite this, the high active NDM still could enter the host cell and cause potential harm to the producer; these SDRs thereby set up the firewall by reductive inactivation of it via pharmacophore quenching (Fig.\u00a07). This redox-governed cycle avoided the self-cytotoxicity and guaranteed no antibiotic consumption. Beyond that, the SDRs also confer the host cells general immunity toward most of the THIQ antibiotics because all the members of this family employ the common hemiaminal pharmacophore for DNA alkylation (Fig.\u00a07). During this manuscript preparation, a fungal redox-mediated self-resistance cycle in macrolide A26771B biosynthesis was elucidated via reversible conversion of a ketone and alcohol33. While, compartmentalized biosynthesis of natural products is widely observed in eukaryotic cells of fungi to avoid self-harm34,35. Our discovery, featuring with enzymatic substrate promiscuity and widely distributed homolog genes, not only provided an omnibearing resistance mode toward THIQ family antibiotics in prokaryotic cells, but also displayed a multi-level and sophisticated damage-control in bacterial secondary metabolism.Fig. 7Summary of the multi-level resistance model involved in NDM and SFM biosynthesis.a Damage-control process in secondary metabolic pathway controls the efficiency of biosynthetic machinery. b Self-resistance during biosynthesis by NapW-homologs ensures the safety of antibiotic-producing strains. c General immunity against THIQs is not only involved in antibiotic-producing hosts, but also exists in non-antibiotic-producing microbes containing NapW-homologs.", "Fig. 7Summary of the multi-level resistance model involved in NDM and SFM biosynthesis.a Damage-control process in secondary metabolic pathway controls the efficiency of biosynthetic machinery. b Self-resistance during biosynthesis by NapW-homologs ensures the safety of antibiotic-producing strains. c General immunity against THIQs is not only involved in antibiotic-producing hosts, but also exists in non-antibiotic-producing microbes containing NapW-homologs.", "Summary of the multi-level resistance model involved in NDM and SFM biosynthesis.", "a Damage-control process in secondary metabolic pathway controls the efficiency of biosynthetic machinery. b Self-resistance during biosynthesis by NapW-homologs ensures the safety of antibiotic-producing strains. c General immunity against THIQs is not only involved in antibiotic-producing hosts, but also exists in non-antibiotic-producing microbes containing NapW-homologs.", "One of the notable features of self-resistance in THIQ biosynthesis is taking advantage of reductive reaction to quench pharmacophore in situ apart from canonical modification on the end product. Actually, enzyme-guided chemical modification of compound is one of the most widely existed strategies for antibiotic resistance including self-resistance involved in biosynthetic pathways. However, these modifications are usually limited by reversible group-transfer reactions acting on end-products, such as methylation, acylation, phosphorylation, glycosylation, amino-, or peptide-acylation and so on1,36. Rare cases employing reductive reaction include virginiamycin M1 reductase-catalyzed conversion of a ketone to alcohol37, a nitroreductase-mediated chloramphenicol inactivation and CytA-catalyzed dehydroxylation of cytorhodin38,39, as well as two recently-discovered fungal examples including a multistep reduction cascade in monasone naphthoquinone and a redox-cycle in A26771B biosynthesis33,40. Most of these modifications change the structure of antibiotics to prevent them from binding to the responding cellular target inside the cell rather than destroy the pharmacophore. This discovery of SDRs, functional as imine reductase, mediated reductive inactivation of hemiaminal pharmacophore without destruction of the THIQ skeleton structure, thereby added another enzymatic reaction in bacteria beyond the typical hydrolysis for warhead inactivation.", "Another significance of this self-resistance model in THIQ biosynthesis is the cryptically temporal and spatial shielding mode comprehensively integrated into the biosynthetic pathway. Antibiotic-producer usually evolved self-resistance strategy to deal with the final active compound; sometimes, analogs with similar structure could also be detoxified. Indeed, the SDRs encoded by the BGC and genome exhibit effectively reductive inactivation of THIQ antibiotics including NDM, SFM, ET-743, and LMM, which bear structural diversity despite belonging to the same family. Beyond that, enough amount of SDRs encoded by more than one copy of gene could also recognize the propeptide-linked intermediate, which led to completely blocking the pharmacophore and fundamentally destroying the warhead accompanied by the scaffold-formation. This modification step likely occurs at the early stage before tailoring modifications thereby resulting in the harmlessness of all the following metabolites in cytoplasm. Moreover, this reductive modification is also chemically favorable due to the improved stability of the resulted intermediate, which facilitates the biosynthetic steps. Thus, these SDRs not only confer general immunity toward natural occurring final THIQ antibiotics, but also play an important role in damage-control process during the entire biosynthetic route (Fig.\u00a07). In recent years, more and more enzymes of unknown function are discovered to be functional as damage-control enzymes for repairing or inactivating the offending metabolites in primary metabolism41. Herein, the SDRs-catalyzed reduction in THIQ biosynthesis from Steptomyces represents a sophisticated damage-control in secondary metabolic pathway to accurately control the efficiency of biosynthetic machinery.", "Extensive study of the molecular mechanisms of self-resistance, resistance/resistome are becoming a fundamental paradigm for combating the antibiotic resistance crises42\u201344. Based on the BGC of high potent secondary metabolites, systemic mining and deeply understanding the self-resistance determinants in the producers thereby provided a well-evolved model system for finding different resistance elements toward specific family of antibiotics42. Significantly, the homologous resistance genes could be widespread in nature including in the human microbiome, such accumulating evidences including NapW-like SDRs-mediated hemiaminal pharmacophore detoxification in THIQs reported here, GyrI-like cyclopropane hydrolase-catalyzed cyclopropyl warhead opening for YTM/CC-1065 pathway9, and TnmS1-like sequestration proteins-guided enediyne resistance for tiancimycin biosynthesis45. With the increasingly and frequently clinical application of this family of antibiotics, the discovery of widespread NapW-like SDRs-mediated resistances may be critical for dealing with the potential clinical resistance problem.", "In summary, we have identified an unprecedented self-resistance system in Streptomyces based on the elucidation of NDM biosynthetic pathway and verified by SFM-A biosynthesis. Apart from the common antibiotic effluxion by transporters and DNA-damage repair by UV-repair proteins, this sophisticated self-resistance machinery includes (i) propeptide formed by NRPSs, (ii) reductive inactivation of hemiaminal pharmacophore by SDRs in situ, (iii) prodrug maturation with inactivated intermediate exclusion, (iv) extracellularly oxidative reactivation by secreted oxidoreductase, (v) extracellularly over-oxidative inactivation to control antibiotic concentration, and (vi) intracellularly reductive inactivation of antibiotic/analogs. Considering the clinical usage of ET-743 and the potency of other members of THIQs12,14,29, our findings thereby may be used to predict, determine the potent drug resistance and even inform the design of therapeutic agents that might not be subject to, or can circumvent further drug resistance in clinical settings. In addition, our enzymological studies show this family of SDRs functional as stereoselective imine reductase exhibiting excellent substrate-tolerance toward complex structure, thus provided more choices as biocatalyst for preparation of diastereomerically enriched complex saturated amine heterocycles20,46,47."]
