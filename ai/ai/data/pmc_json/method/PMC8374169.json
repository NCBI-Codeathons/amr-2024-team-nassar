["Materials and Methods", "Description of Strains and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing", "Sixteen MRSE isolates, selected as a subsample from a previous study (Asante et al., 2021) based on their resistance profiles, were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Briefly, an initial 89 suspected CoNS isolates were collected from blood cultures sourced from hospitals within the uMgungundlovu District in the KwaZulu-Natal Province. Isolates were selected based on their resistance to cefoxitin and to multiple antibiotics. MRSE isolates were selected based on their well-documented role as a frequent cause of nosocomial infection and ability to form biofilms (Becker et al., 2014). The 16 clinical MRSE isolates collected from patients in three hospitals in the uMgungundlovu District in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, had been subjected to initial identification by Gram staining, colony characteristics, and the StaphaurexTM Latex Agglutination Test (Thermo Scientific, Kent, United Kingdom). Speciation of isolates was done using the automated VITEK 2 system (BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-L\u2019Etoile, France).", "The antibiotypes for 20 antibiotics were determined by the Kirby\u2013Bauer disk-diffusion method or by the broth microdilution method. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines were used to interpret their antimicrobial susceptibility (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2016). Antibiotics tested (disk diffusion) included penicillin G (10 \u03bcg), cefoxitin (30 \u03bcg), ceftaroline (30 \u03bcg), ciprofloxacin (5 \u03bcg), moxifloxacin (5 \u03bcg), azithromycin (15 \u03bcg), erythromycin (15 \u03bcg), gentamicin (120 \u03bcg), amikacin (30 \u03bcg), chloramphenicol (30 \u03bcg), tetracycline (30 \u03bcg), doxycycline (30 \u03bcg), tigecycline (15 \u03bcg), teicoplanin (30 \u03bcg), linezolid (30 \u03bcg), clindamycin (10 \u03bcg), rifampicin (5 \u03bcg), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (1.25/23.75 \u03bcg), and nitrofurantoin (300 \u03bcg). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of vancomycin was determined by the broth microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2016). The cefoxitin disk diffusion was used to detect methicillin resistance and molecularly confirmed by PCR detection of mecA gene.", "Phenotypic Detection of Biofilm Formation", "The biofilm-forming abilities of isolates were assessed by the tissue culture plate method described by Mitchell et al. (2010). Briefly, isolates were grown in trypticase soy broth (TSB) supplemented with glucose for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. Sterile 96-well microtiter plates were inoculated with bacterial suspension adjusted to 0.5 MacFarland standard and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The plates were washed after incubation and dried at room temperature. The wells then stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and washed thrice with distilled water. A 30% acetic acid solution was added to solubilize the crystal violet retained by the biofilm. The optical densities of samples in each well were read at 570 nm using a microtiter plate reader (BMG LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany). S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 was used as positive control. Isolates were categorized as strong, moderate, weak, and non-biofilm formers, using the formula OD < ODC = no biofilm producer, ODC < OD \u2264 (2 \u00d7 ODC) = weak biofilm producer, (2ODC) < OD \u2264 (4 \u00d7 ODC) = moderate biofilm producer, and (4 \u00d7 ODC) < OD = strong biofilm producer, where ODC is the average OD of the negative control.", "Whole-Genome Sequencing", "Genomic DNA (gDNA) from pure colonies of MRSE isolates grown from overnight cultures was extracted and purified using the GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA kit (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, while the concentration and purity were determined using NanodropTM 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, United States). For library preparation, the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit was used to generate paired-end libraries, followed by WGS on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States) at the Sequencing Core Facility, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.", "Quality trimming of the sequence reads was done by the use of Sickle version 1.331, while assembler, SPAdes version 3.11 (Bankevich et al., 2012), and the CLC Genomics Workbench version 10.1 (CLC, Bio-QIAGEN, Aarhus, Denmark) were used for de novo assembly of the reads. The assembled contiguous sequences were submitted via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline to GenBank for gene annotation.

The prediction of isolates\u2019 pathogenicity toward human hosts was determined by PathogenFinder available at https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/PathogenFinder/. The assembled genomes from the WGS data were annotated to predict and identify the resistome using ResFinder 4.1 (with a minimum length and threshold of 60% and 90%, respectively), and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD)3 (Alcock et al., 2020), using the default selection criteria \u201cperfect and strict hits only.\u201d The platforms were used side by side to compensate for the inherent deficits in individual platforms.", "We determined the genetic basis (chromosomal single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]) for observed fluoroquinolone and rifampicin resistance from the assembled genomes by investigating mutations conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones and rifampicin using BLASTn (Altschul et al., 1990). Briefly, gyrA, gyrB, parC, parE, and rpoB genes in a reference susceptible S. epidermidis (S. epidermidis strain ATCC 12228) were aligned with the corresponding genes from resistant isolates in this study with BLASTn to call for SNPs in those genes using the Clustal Omega tool (European Molecular Biology Laboratory). Thus, the mutations in the genomes of the study isolates were manually curated.", "VirulenceFinder 2.0 (using a minimum length of 60% and a threshold of 90%)4 (Joensen et al., 2014), virulence factor database (VFDB)5, and BacWGSTdb6 were used to screen for the presence of virulence genes. Various virulence determinants consistent with different major virulence factors (including adherence, enzymes, immune evasion, secretion system, toxins, anti-phagocytosis, biofilm formation/adherence, and intracellular survival) associated with S. epidermidis were investigated.", "In silico Multilocus Sequence Typing", "Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed in silico using MLST 2.0 program software7 available on the website of the Center for Genomic Epidemiology (Larsen et al., 2012) and the public molecular typing database, PubMLST8. Sequence types were assigned by matching the internal fragments of the seven housekeeping genes (arcC, aroE, gtr, mutS, pyrR, tpiA, and yqiL) from S. epidermidis to identify alleles (Thomas et al., 2007). We performed eBURST analyses (Feil et al., 2004) in the MLST database to identify clones similar to obtained STs.", "Identification of Mobile Genetic Elements and Genetic Support Environment", "Mobile genetic elements associated with ARGs and their genetic context were investigated using NCBI annotations. RAST 2.0 (Aziz et al., 2008) was used to ascertain MGEs and the genetic support environment. The web-based typing tool SCCmecFinder9 was used for the in silico determination of the SCCmec types and their structural position in the MRSE isolates. In silico detection of plasmid replicon types was done out using PlasmidFinder 2.1, available at https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/PlasmidFinder/ (Carattoli et al., 2014).", "The PHASTER tool10 was used to identify and annotate prophage sequences within the genomes (Arndt et al., 2016). Only the prophage regions identified as \u201cintact\u201d by PHASTER were considered. The region positions of the prophages were BLASTED on CARD to determine if the prophages harbored resistance genes. ISs and transposons flanking the resistance genes were identified using the MobileElementFinder v1.0.3 (2020-10-09)11 (Johansson et al., 2020), available on the website of the Center for Genomic Epidemiology12. We used NCBI annotations to determine the support environment of the resistance genes.", "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-Associated (CRISPR-Cas System), Arginine Catabolic Mobile Element, and Restriction-Modification System", "We searched for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and cas genes in the sequence data using the CRISPRCasFinder, available at https://crisprcas.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/CrisprCasFinder/Index, using the default advanced settings for CRISPR and the clustering model \u201cSubTyping\u201d for Cas.

The ACME genes within the genomes were detected and aligned. Alignment of the ACME components made up of the arc operon, the opp3 operon, and the kdp operon, which was used to classify the ACME components as follows: arc and opp3 operons (type I), the arc operon only (type II), the opp3 operon only (type III), the arc and kdp operons (type IV), and all three arc, opp, and kdp operons (type V), using Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC)13 annotations.", "Phylogenetic Analyses Using Whole-Genome Sequencing Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Whole-Genome Sequencing Multilocus Sequence Type Trees", "Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the maximum likelihood method using the CSIPhylogeny14 (Kaas et al., 2014), which performs SNP calling, filtering of the SNPs, and inferring phylogeny based on the concatenated alignment of the high-quality SNPs, using the assembled contigs. The analysis was performed on the platform using default parameters, as follows: minimum depth at SNP positions of 10\u00d7; minimum relative depth at SNP positions of 10%; minimum distance between SNPs (prune) at 10 bp; minimum SNP quality of 30; minimum read mapping quality of 25; and minimum Z-score of 1.96. S. aureus ATCC 25923 was used to root the tree, facilitating the configuration of the phylogenetic distance between the isolates on the branches. Assembled genomes for comparison were uploaded. To see how our isolates compare with S. epidermidis genomes from Africa, we searched and downloaded S. epidermidis genomes reported in Africa and curated on the PATRIC website and included them in the analysis. To edit and visualize the phylogenetic tree, we used the Figtree program15.
