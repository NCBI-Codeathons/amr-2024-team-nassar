["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Strains and media", "Streptomyces sahachiroi ATCC 33158 and its series of mutant strains were grown on PS5 medium (5 g/l cotton seed meal, 5 g/l soluble starch, 20 g/l agar, pH 7.0) for spores formation, and on GYM medium (4 g/l glucose, 4 g/l yeast extract, 10 g/l malt extract, 2 g/l CaCO3, 20 g/l agar, pH 6.8) for fermentation. Streptomyces lividans ZX1 and its derivative strains for heterologous expression strains were cultured on MS medium (20 g/l soybean meal, 20 g/l mannitol, 20 g/l agar, pH\u00a07.2). Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 and BL21 (DE3) were grown in LB or on LB solid medium (10 g/l tryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract, 5 g/l NaCl, 20 g/l agar, pH 7.0) plate at 37\u00b0C. The other strains, plasmids and primers used in this study were presented in Supplementary Table S1 and Table S2.", "Production and isolation of AZB", "For AZB production, S. sahachiroi ATCC 33158 was inoculated on GYM medium and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 3 days. After fermentation, AZB was isolated and purified according to the previous literatures (24,25).", "Fluorescence titration assay", "Since the intrinsic fluorescence of AziN is mainly derived from tryptophan residues, the excitation wavelength was 295 nm and emission spectra were collected between 305 and 500 nm with a bandwidth of 5 nm. The dissociation constant (Kd) was measured in three independent replicate experiments by fluorimetric titration of 1 \u03bcM AziN with the addition of 3 mM different ligands (AZB, MMC, or metal ions) prepared in Tris\u2013HCl buffer. The fluorescence intensity at 320 nm was chosen to measure the binding constant.

(22) in a reaction buffer (25 mM triethanolamine, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The ICL derived from an abasic (Ap) site with an adenine residue on the antisense strand were prepared as previously described (26). A 2\u2032-deoxyuridine (dU)-containing oligodeoxynucleotide duplex (AU, Supplementary Table S3) was designed according to Price et\u00a0al. (26). Through hydrolysis of uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), dU sites were converted into Ap sites to give the Ap-containing duplexes which were 3\u2032-end-FAM labelled on the forward strand (Ap/A-1) and the reverse strand (Ap/A-2), respectively. The Ap-A ICL products were generated by incubation of the Ap-containing duplexes in a reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH\u00a07, 100 NaCl) at 37\u00b0C for 120 h.", "DNA cleavage assay", "The crosslinked DNA purified by chloroform was reacted with AziN at 30\u00b0C for 20 min and subsequently electrophoresed after treatment with 1 mg/ml proteinase K at 37\u00b0C for 15 min."]
