["Methods", "Various molecular events associated with apoptosis were assessed in control and CTPE cells that were obtained after 8 weeks of continuous cadmium exposure.", "Materials and Methods", "Chemicals and reagents", "Cadmium chloride (CdCl2), etoposide, cisplatin, chloroform, isopropanol, formaldehyde, and ethidium bromide were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). A nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI).", "Cell line and treatment", "The development of the human nontumorigenic parental RWPE-1 cell line, used as the control in this work, and the derivation of the cadmium-transformed prostate epithelial cell line are described in detail elsewhere (Achanzar et al. 2001; Bello et al. 1997; Webber et al. 2001). Although immortalized, RWPE-1 cells have retained properties exhibited by normal prostate epithelium in vivo. The CTPE cell line was developed by chronic cadmium exposure of the RWPE-1 cell line as previously described, and CTPE cells form aggressive, prostate carcinoma-like tumors upon inoculation into nude mice (Achanzar et al. 2001). The observed malignant transformation in CTPE cells is not reversible after removal from cadmium. To define steady-state events and to prevent acute phase effects of cadmium, cells were placed in cadmium-free media for 2 or more weeks before the assessment of experiments. Control and CTPE cells were grown in keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM) containing 50 \u03bcg/mL bovine pituitary extract (BPE), 5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 1 \u00d7 antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (10,000 U/mL penicillin G sodium, 10,000 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin sulfate, 25 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin B). Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were passed weekly.", "Establishing Bcl-2 producing cell line", "Murine Bcl-2 from pUSEamp-Bcl2 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY) was sub-cloned into pLNCX2 (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) as an 816-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment. Bcl-2 expression was under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. A Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to replace the A nucleotide with a C in the coding sequence, leading to the substitution of a serine for a tyrosine at the 21st amino acid in the protein sequence. Mutagenesis forward and reverse primers used were 5\u2032-ATGAAGTACATA CATTCTAAGCTGTCACAGAGG-3 and 5\u2032-TCTGTGACAGCTTAGAATGTATG TACTTCATC-3\u2032, respectively. The sequence-verified wild-type Bcl-2, mutated Bcl-2, and pLNCX2 empty vector plasmid were trans-fected separately into the BD RetroPACK PT-67 (NIH 3T3) cell line. After 10\u201314 days of growth (G418 selection, 750 \u03bcg/mL), large visible clones were isolated and transferred to individual dishes (Huang et al. 1997). Clones with high expression of Bcl-2 protein or mutant Bcl-2, termed PT67-Bcl-2 and PT67-Bcl2Y21S, were maintained for further analysis. The level of the endogenous Bcl-2 in PT67-Vector was too low to be detected. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin sulfate, and 100 U/mL penicillin G sodium.", "Cell proliferation", "We used the Promega Cell Titer 96 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega) to determine acute cytotoxicity of cadmium. This assay measures the amount of formazan produced by metabolic conversion of Owen\u2019s reagent [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt, MTS] by dehydrogenase enzymes found in the mitochondria of metabolically active cells. The quantity of formazan product, as measured by absorbance at 490 nm, is directly proportional to the number of living cells. A minimum of four replicates of 10,000 cells per well were plated in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere to the plate for 24 hr, at which time the media was removed and replaced with fresh media containing the cadmium. Cells were then incubated for an additional 24 hr and cell viability was determined (Qu et al. 2001, 2005). We determined the LC50 (median lethal concentration) values by analyzing the linear portion of the metabolic integrity curves and comparing between different cells.", "Determination of apoptosis by flow cytometry", "Detection of phosphatidylserine on the outer plasma membrane of apoptotic cells was performed using Annexin V and propidium iodide according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Trevigen, Inc. Gaithersburg, MD). For each sample, 10,000 cells were examined by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSort (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The percent of apoptotic cells was determined by analysis of the dot plots using CellQuest software (Qu et al. 2002).", "Western blot analysis", "Western blot analysis", "After cells were grown to 70\u201380% confluence, they were placed in supplement-free medium for 24 hr.

The cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 30 min on ice, sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was designated as the cell lysate (Qu et al. 2002). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Protein samples (20 \u03bcg) derived from the various cell preparations were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and probed with various antibodies.

Briefly, cell extracts containing 250 \u03bcg total protein were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with an N-terminal c-Jun fusion protein bound to glutathione\u2013Sepharose beads for JNK kinase activity assay. The kinase reaction was performed by adding 100 \u03bcmol/L adenosine triphosphate to the suspension. Phosphorylation of c-Jun was measured by Western blot analysis with a phospho-specific c-Jun antibody that specifically detects Ser63-phosphorylated c-Jun, a site important for c-Jun-dependent transcriptional activity (Qu et al. 2002).", "Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis", "Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis", "Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (GIBCO/BRL Life Technologies, Bethesda, MD), then subjected to DNase digestion by using a RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) followed by the cleanup using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen).
