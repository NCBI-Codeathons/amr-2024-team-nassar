["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Validation of the lexQSABC operon by RT-PCR.", "L. antibioticus strain OH13 was grown at 28\u00b0C overnight in nutrient broth (3 g beef extract, 1 g yeast extract, 5 g tryptone, 10 g sucrose [pH = 7.0 to 7.2] in 1 liter distilled water) as seed culture. Then, a 1% (vol/vol) seed culture was transferred to a 1/10 dilution of tryptic soy broth (TSB). L. antibioticus OH13 cells were immediately harvested at an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1.0 via centrifugation at 4,000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Total RNA was extracted using a bacterial RNA extraction kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA) and quantified using an Eppendorf BioPhotometer Plus. Subsequently, Vazyme HiScript II Q RT SuperMix was used to eliminate gDNA and produce cDNA from 250\u2009ng of RNA. Specific primers for each fragment are provided in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Standard PCR used TransTaq-T DNA polymerase with cDNA as the template, RNA and H2O as the negative control, and gDNA as the positive control.", "Purification of LexR and mutants.", "The gene lexR was amplified from gDNA of OH13 with primers lexR-PF and lexR-PR (Table S1). The PCR product was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into plasmid pET-28a to obtain a pET-lexR construct. The lexR sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression construct pET-lexR was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). The BL21-pET-lexR overnight culture was transferred to 100\u2009mL LB medium containing kanamycin (25\u2009\u03bcg/mL) and grown until an OD600 of 0.6. Isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.5\u2009mM, and cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for an additional 6\u2009h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20\u2009mL buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-Cl, 300\u2009mM NaCl; pH 7.9) and then lysed ultrasonically on ice. The supernatant was then loaded onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column previously calibrated with 5\u2009mM imidazole buffer. His6-tagged LexR protein (53.1\u2009kDa) was purified using an imidazole step gradient and detected with SDS-PAGE. Protein with His6 tag was concentrated and measured with Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad) and then used in EMSAs. Residue mutants LexR-V146A, LexR-K195A, and LexR-V146A-K195A were obtained using the appropriate mutant genes in the purification scheme. The site mutation for LexR was constructed through direct gene synthesis.", "EMSA.", "The promoter region of the lexQSABC operon was predicted with the online tool BPROM (http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=bprom&group=programs&subgroup=gfindb). A 165-bp DNA fragment containing the lexQSABC promoter region and a 158-bp promoter region from another RND efflux pump operon as control were amplified via PCR with 5\u2032-end biotin-labeled primers. We also synthesized four pairs of complementary oligonucleotide 5\u2032-end biotin-labeled primers. Primers were mixed with 1\u00d7 annealing buffer (10\u00d7 annealing buffer; 100\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, 0.1\u2009mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) and annealed at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. The products were kept at room temperature for 2\u2009h, and subsequently we obtained the probes. Probe 1 was a 58-bp sequence from the lexQSABC promoter, and probe 2 was a 50-bp sequence without the putative binding site of LexR. Probe 3 was a 58-bp sequence from the 158-bp control probe, and probe 4 was a 58-bp sequence replacing the putative binding site of LexR to probe 3. The sequences of probes are shown in the supplemental material. EMSA was conducted using LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kits (Thermo Scientific). The manufacturer\u2019s instructions were followed for the EMSA, with binding reaction mixtures (20\u2009\u03bcL) containing 1\u00d7 binding buffer, 50\u2009ng/\u03bcL poly(dI-dC), 2.5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 5\u2009mM MgCl, 0.05% (vol/vol) NP-40, 5\u2009fmol labeled probe, and different concentrations of LexR and myxin as required. Reactions were continued for 30\u2009min at room temperature, and subsequent steps were completed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Chemiluminescence signals of biotin-labeled probes were captured using a Tanon 4600 imaging system (China). The primers are listed in Table S1.", "SPR analysis.", "The binding affinity of myxin for LexR and its mutants was investigated via SPR using a bScreen LB 991 label-free microarray system (Berthold Technologies, Germany). Myxin was immobilized on photo cross-linker SPRi sensor chips, and LexR and mutant proteins were diluted separately with running buffer phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST; pH 7.4) at concentrations of 10, 40, 160, 640, and 2,560\u2009nM. The injection time was >600 s at a flow rate of 0.5\u2009\u03bcL/s for each successive stage. Chips were then washed with running buffer for 360 s at a flow rate of 0.5\u2009\u03bcL/s in each dissociation stage. Chip surfaces were regenerated to remove any remaining bound material with a pulse of 10\u2009mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) at 20\u2009\u03bcL/min for 300 s at the end of each association-dissociation cycle.", "Complementation and site-directed mutation of LexR.", "For complementation of lexR, the target gene was amplified with primers lexR-CF and lexR-CR and then cloned into the plasmid pBBR1-MCS5. To construct the LexR site-directed mutants V146A or K195A, two sequences were obtained with primers (pBBR-lexR-F/146-1-R and 146-2-F/pBBR-lexR-R for V146A, pBBR-lexR-F/195-1-R and 195-2-F/pBBR-lexR-R for K195A), and then assembled with the plasmid pBBR1-MCS5. The expression constructs were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing and subsequently introduced into lexR deletion mutants by electroporation. The resultant strains were validated by PCR. The primers are listed in Table S1.", "qRT-PCR.", "Bacterial cells were cultured in 1/10 TSB and collected at an OD600 of ~1.0. RNA extraction was carried out with a bacterial RNA extraction kit (Yeasen MolPure, China). The concentration and quality of RNA were detected with an Eppendorf BioPhotometer Plus. cDNA synthesis was performed with 250\u2009ng of RNA using a kit (Vazyme HiScript II Q RT SuperMix with gDNA wiper). Primers for qRT-PCR designed with primer 3 online are shown in Table S1, and the 16S rRNA gene was used as a reference. The qRT-PCRs was performed on a Quantstudio 6 Flex system (Applied Biosystems) using ChamQ SYBR qPCR master mix (Vazyme). The experiment was repeated three times, each time in triplicate. Relative expression was analyzed using the threshold cycle (2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT) method."]
