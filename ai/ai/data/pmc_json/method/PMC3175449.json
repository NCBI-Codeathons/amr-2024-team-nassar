["Methods", "Production of recombinant EhpR", "ehpR (UniProtKB entry Q8GPH6) was amplified from a pBluescript plasmid with primers ehpR-for (5'-GGACCTCCATATGACTGATCTAGCTGGCCC-3') and ehpR-rev (5'-TTGGATCCTCAATCAAGCGGGCAGACC-3') and then cloned into pET15b (Merck Biosciences). Heterologous expression employed E. coli Rosetta pLysS [DE3] (Merck Biosciences) in LB medium at 37\u00b0C induced with 1 mM IPTG. The protein was purified on immobilized Ni2+, using HiTrap chelating resin, followed by cleavage of the N-terminal His6-tag with thrombin and final size exclusion chromatography on Superdex S75 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled, concentrated to 20 mg/ml and stored at -80\u00b0C until further usage.", "Seleno-L-methionine labeling was achieved by suppressing methionine biosynthesis in synthetic media supplemented with Se-L-methionine [26].", "Crystallization, data collection, structure solution and refinement", "Initial crystallization conditions were determined with Crystal Screen and Crystal Screen 2 from Hampton Research. The optimized setup consisted of a hanging drop of 1 \u03bcl protein solution at 20 mg/ml EhpR mixed with 1 \u03bcl reservoir (27 - 30% PEG 4000, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6) equilibrated against 500 \u03bcl reservoir at room temperature. Crystals of the seleno-L-methionine labeled protein were obtained under similar conditions. For cocrystallization with griseoluteic acid, a suspension of the ligand at a nominal concentration of 5 mM was prepared in 100 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.5 and then mixed 1:1 with protein solution at 40 mg/ml EhpR on ice for one hour. Griseoluteic acid was prepared as described previously [10].", "Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamlines ID14EH2, ID14EH3 and ID29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation facility (ESRF Grenoble, France). Cryoprotection was not required. All data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the XDS package [27]. The structure of the apo form was solved from SAD data collected at the K-absorption edge of a crystal prepared from seleno-L-methionine labeled protein. Anomalous differences were extracted with XPREP (Bruker Analytical X-ray Solutions) and selenium atoms were located with SHELXD [28]. Phasing was achieved in SHARP [29] and the correct hand was discerned after solvent flattening with SOLOMON [30] and DM [31] from the CCP4 suite [32]. Bones were edited in O [16] and used to superimpose a similar structure that had previously been identified with PHYRE [33]. This was then used to derive a monomer mask and NCS operators using MAMA [34], LSQMAN [35] and IMP from the RAVE package [32]. After overlap removal with NCSMASK from the CCP4 suite, DM was employed for 4-fold NCS-averaging, which greatly improved the quality of the electron density map. The model was traced in O [36] and COOT [37]. REFMAC5 [38] was employed for maximum likelihood refinement, defining each single chain as a TLS body.", "The high-resolution EhpR/GA complex was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP [39], using a dimer of the apo structure as search model. Refinement followed a similar procedure as for the apo form, using ligand restraints dictionaries generated with PRODRG [40] for REFMAC5 and with eLBOW [41] for phenix.refine [38]. phenix.refine was employed for the final rounds of refinement, which included the determination of anisotropic displacement parameters. The restraints for griseoluteic acid were tightened to preserve the geometry of the ligand in the course of refinement with phenix.refine.", "Figures were prepared with PyMOL [41].", "Full data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table 1.", "Stopped flow experiments", "Association kinetics of EhpR with griseoluteic acid were observed at 25\u00b0C in a stopped flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics) by following changes in the tryptophan fluorescence of the protein (\u03bbex = 298 nm; \u03bbem > 320 nm (cut-off filter)) for 1 second. EhpR was applied at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM, the concentration of GA was varied between 250 and 500 \u03bcM. Both protein and ligand were dissolved in 50 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2. Individual stopped-flow traces were fitted to a single exponential to obtain pseudo first-order rate constants (kobs). While these experiments demonstrated that EhpR and GA interact, no linear relationship between ligand concentration and kobs was observed. As a consequence, it was not possible to determine the affinity or the association rate constant of the reaction.", "Microscale thermophoresis measurements", "His6-tagged EhpR at a concentration of 118 \u03bcM was labeled with fluorescein isothionate (FITC) at a protein:reagent ratio of 1:0.9 in 0.1 M Na2CO3 pH 9.3 at 298 K for one hour. Unreacted FITC was removed with a NAP5 sephadex column (GE Healthcare) primed with 0.1 M TRIS-HCl pH 8.5, resulting in a label/protein ratio of 0.8.", "A series of 15 1:2 dilutions from 4 mM to 122 nM GA in 25 nM FITC-EhpR solution was prepared and thermophoresis at 298 K was measured for 30 s in a Monolith NT.115 device (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH), using 100% infrared laser power. Data of three independent runs were averaged and fitted to a hyperbolic function using Grafit (Erithacus Software)."]
