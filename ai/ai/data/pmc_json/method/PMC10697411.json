Streptomyces coelicolor M145 was used as a host to study actinorhodin biosynthesis. Cloning vectors and Escherichia coli cell lines (Supporting information text) were obtained kindly from Prof. A. Francis Stewart, Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany. Oligonucleotide primers used in our experiment were purchased from Eurofins Genomics GmbH Germany. All the chemicals, endonucleases, and reagents used in our experiment were purchased from Merck, USA, unless otherwise stated.", "Genome analysis", "Genomic DNA was extracted as previously reported (Nikodinovic et al. 2003). Sequencing was done at Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) using Illumina MiSeq v3 (2 \u00d7 300\u00a0bp). Read quality was checked using FASTQC (v0.11.2) (Andrews 2015). Assembly was performed using A5-MiSeq (v20150522)(Coil, Jospin and Darling 2015). Contiguation was performed with ABACAS (v1.3.1) (Assefa et al. 2009) using S. albus NK660 (CP007574.1) as a reference and the gaps were filled using IMAGE (v2.4.1)(Tsai, Otto and Berriman 2010). The assembly was annotated using RAST (Brettin et al. 2015). All programs were run on the CSC\u2014IT Center for Science's Taito super-cluster (Espoo, Finland). Finally, the assembly was run on antiSMASH (v6.0.1) (Blin et al. 2019) for biosynthetic gene cluster prediction and on BiG-FAM (Kautsar et al. 2021) to uncover novel BGCs. This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession JAKQYH000000000. The version described in this paper is version JAKQYH010000000. The naphthocyclinone biosynthetic gene cluster was deposited in the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (Medema et al. 2015) (MIBiG) database under the accession number BGC0000248. The biosynthetic gene clusters were visually compared using EasyFig (Sullivan, Petty, Beatson 2011).", "General DNA techniques and gene cloning", "The strategy for cloning and recombineering of the ncn BGC was carried out as devised by Wang et al.

The inactivation of actVA-3 was carried out by homologous recombination using vector pWHM3 (Vara et al. 1989), including an additional oriT sequence to allow conjugation to Streptomyces, as described in the Supporting information text.", "Production and purification of \u03b1-naphthocyclinone acid", "The S. albus/SA-naphtho cells were grown in 4\u00a0L NoS-soyE1, which is modified E1 without starch (Ylihonko et al. 1994, Oja et al. 2008) at 30\u25cbC in 50\u00a0mL batches for 7 d and 300\u00a0mL batches for 8 d with an agitation of 250\u00a0rpm in both cases. The cells were harvested and discarded. The supernatant was subjected to ethyl acetate extraction with 1% (v/v) of acetic acid. The extraction was repeated 2\u20134 times. The ethyl acetate fractions were combined and dried. Fractions were stored at \u221220\u25cbC. Part of the sample was solubilized in chloroform and loaded to the column and the part that did not solubilize was dissolved in acetone and dried with silica and dry-loaded to the column. The silica columns were equilibrated with 10:90 acetone:chloroform. A gradient from 10 to 100% of acetone was run, but the main compound did not elute from the column. Finally, 100% methanol was used to elute the main compound, which was collected and dried. The dried sample was solubilized with methanol and subjected to preparative HPLC, LC-20 AP with a diode array detector SPD-M20A (Shimadzu) with a C-18 column (Kinetex Prep C18, 5\u00a0\u00b5m, 250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a021.2\u00a0mm; Phenomenex). The fractions containing the main compound were combined and extracted with chloroform, dried, and stored at \u221220\u25cbC.

For this, a seed culture was prepared a day before the main culture, and 10% of it was inoculated to the main production culture. To the knockout mutants, Apra (50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) was added to the growth media. After 8 d, the growth culture was centrifuged to obtain the supernatant, and the cells were discarded. The supernatant was incubated with an adsorbent (LXA1180, Sunresin SEPLITE\u00ae, 20\u00a0g/L) overnight. The LXA1180 was collected, washed with water and the bound compounds were extracted with 20% (v/v) methanol. The aqueous methanol was acidified with 1% (v/v) acetic acid and extracted with chloroform. The chloroform phase was dried and stored at \u221220\u25cbC. The dried sample was dissolved in chloroform and loaded to a silica column equilibrated with 10:90 methanol:chloroform. A gradient from 10% to 100% of methanol was run. The fractions containing the compound of interest were combined and dried. The sample was dissolved in methanol and purified using preparative HPLC using LC-20 AP with a diode array detector SPD-M20A (Shimadzu) with a C-18 column (Kinetex Prep C18, 5\u00a0\u00b5m, 250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a021.2\u00a0mm; Phenomenex).

Actinorhodin production was calculated based on area percentage at 520\u00a0nm.", "Analysis of metabolites", "Shimadzu's SCL-10Avp HPLC with an SPD-M10Avp diode array detector was used to perform analytical HPLC analyses. The analyses to detect naphthocyclinones were performed with a reversed-phase column (Phenomenex, Kinetex, 2.6\u00a0\u00b5m, 4.6 \u00d7 100\u00a0mm) using gradients from 15% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid to 100% acetonitrile. Production of actinorhodin was analysed using a reversed-phase column (Phenomenex Luna Phenyl-Hexyl 100, 10-\u00b5m, 250- by 10-mm column) using a gradient from 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid in water to 100% acetonitrile. MS analyses were carried out with either a low-resolution MS with an HPLC system (Agilent 1260 Infinity 6120 Quadropole LC-MS) with similar conditions and column as the analytical HPLC, or with a MicrOTOF-Q high-resolution MS with direct injection (Bruker Daltonics). NMR samples were prepared from overnight desiccated compounds with deuterated methanol (\u03b1-naphthocyclinone acid) and deuterated acetone, methanol, and DMSO for fogacin. NMR analysis was performed with a 600\u00a0MHz Bruker AVANCE-III NMR-system equipped with liquid nitrogen cooled Prodigy TCI (inverted CryoProbe) at 298\u2013300\u00a0K. The experiments included 1D (1H, 13C) and 2D measurements (COSY, HMBC, HSQC and additionally NOESY for fogacin). Topspin (Bruker Biospin) was used for spectral analysis."]
