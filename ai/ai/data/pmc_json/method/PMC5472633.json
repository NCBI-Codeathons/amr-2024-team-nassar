["Methods", "Genome sequencing", "Genome sequencing was conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute as part of the Community Science Program (http://jgi.doe.gov/user-program-info/community-science-program/). DNA was extracted and the sequence annotation and assembly carried out as previously described27. Genomic data is available from the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database (https://img.jgi.doe.gov). IMG genomes ID and NCBI taxon numbers are provided in Supplementary Table\u00a0S1.", "Orthologous group computation", "A total of 119 Salinispora strains (12S. tropica, 62S. arenicola and 45S. pacifica) from 11 different locations (Fig.\u00a01, Supplementary Table\u00a0S1) were analyzed using the program FastOrtho46 to identify groups of orthologous protein coding genes (orthologous groups, OGs). This program is a reimplementation of OrthoMCL47 and performs a bidirectional best blast amino-acid analysis. Clustering based on a percent match was performed using default parameters (cutoff\u2009=\u200970, e-value cutoff\u2009=\u20091e\u221205, and inflation index (I)\u2009=\u20091.5) (https://github.com/juanu/MicroCompGenomics). Rarefaction curves and diversity estimates were generated using the vegan package in R (http://www.R-project.org). The output matrix of FastOrtho was processed to identify species-specific orthologous groups using an Excel macro (https://github.com/joseluisrc/FindSharedGenes). Histograms were plotted from the presence-absence matrix of OGs using the qplot function and the ggplot2 package in R (http://www.R-project.org).", "Identification of the core genome and the detection of recombination", "A series of custom python scripts (htps://github.com/juanu/MicroCompGenomics) were applied to the FastOrtho results to identify the OG members that included gene duplications (paralogs). Orthologous groups that included paralogs were removed to generate the single copy core (SCC) gene pool. The nucleotide sequences of the individual SCC genes in each strain were aligned using MUSCLE with default parameters and trimmed for quality using GBlocks. The SCC genes were screened for evidence of recombination using PhiPack48, which included the statistical tests PHI, MaxChi, and Neighbor Similarity Score, all with default parameters. Recombination was inferred when p-values less than 0.01 were detected. Attempts to use the Recombination Detection Program49 failed due to the large number of loci examined.", "Phylogenetic analyses", "A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was generated for each SCC gene using the program RAxML (command line version) with mid-point rooting and 100 bootstraps (Stamatakis, 2006). The individual gene trees were visualized using the program FigTree v1.3.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree). Trimmed alignments of each gene were then concatenated and used to build ML phylogenies using RAxML50 implemented on the CIPRES portal v2.2 at the San Diego Supercomputer Center51. Analyses included 1,000 bootstrap replicates using the most complex model (GTR\u2009+\u2009GAMMA) for both bootstrapping and final ML optimization using default parameter settings. The resulting tree was rooted at the mid-point and visualized using FigTree. Individual SCC gene trees that showed incongruence at the species level with the concatenated tree were scored as under recombination. Two additional concatenated SCC gene trees were then generated for the subsets of this gene pool that included only genes with evidence of recombination and only genes with no evidence of recombination using the methods described above. A similar set of SCC species trees was also generated using the program ASTRAL31, which uses the best RAxML trees for each gene tree.", "Average nucleotide identity and alignment fraction", "The average nucleotide identity (ANI) and alignment fraction (AF) were determined for all 119 Salinispora genomes using published methods16, 33. ANI values were calculated for all pairwise comparisons and used to compile a distance matrix representing ANI divergence (100 - ANI). The custom scripts used to perform these analyses and generate the ANI dendrogram are available (https://github.com/juanu/ANI_analysis/blob/master/ANI_blastn.py and https://ani.jgi-psf.org/html/download.php). Cytoscape 3.3.0 was used to visualize the results52.", "Clustering based on COG category and functional traits", "The OGs were classified into five major functional categories based on the FastOrtho results and further divided into clusters of orthologous groups (COGs, Supplementary Table\u00a0S3). These classifications were used to build hierarchical cluster analyses based on the presence/absence of OGs assigned to each COG category using the function hclust and the method \u201caverage\u201d in the R package (http://www.R-project.org). A hierarchical cluster analysis was similarly generated using the presence/absence of secondary metabolite BGCs predicted for the 119 Salinispora genomes using antiSMASH34 as previously described27."]
