Oligonucleotides used for gene deletion and verification of the deletion are listed in Table\u00a0S2. PCR targeting was applied to the cosmid LK6 (23), which contained the entire lincomycin biosynthetic cluster. After conjugation of mutated cosmids into S. lincolnensis, kanamycin-sensitive (Kans) and apramycin-resistant (Aprr) double-crossover mutants with target genes replaced by the aac(3)IV-oriT cassette were confirmed by PCR amplification. For the construction of S. lincolnensis \u0394AB (BN3021), S. lincolnensis \u0394AC (BN3018), and S. lincolnensis \u0394BC (BN3008) double mutants, the inactivation cassettes 773 in S. lincolnensis \u0394B (BN3002) and S. lincolnensis \u0394C (BN3001) single mutants were replaced by an unmarked in-frame deletion obtained by FLP-mediated excision of the disruption cassette (62). The second gene to be deleted was replaced with cassette 775 according to the same protocol as used for single-knockout strains. Knockout strains were verified by PCR and Southern blot analysis. The scheme of the orientation of inactivation cassettes in all knockout strains is available in Fig.\u00a0S1.", "Construction of vectors for natural, constitutive, or inducible expression.", "Details on the preparation of vectors and oligonucleotides used are listed in Table\u00a0S2. The vectors An (bearing lmrA with its 1,330-bp upstream sequence), Bn (bearing lmrB gene with an 86-bp upstream region), and Cn (bearing lmrC gene and its 1,281-bp upstream region) were used to express resistance genes under its natural promoter. For constitutive expression, lmrA, lmrB, and lmrC were PCR amplified from ligated under the ermEp promoter of pIJ10257 (64), yielding plasmids AC, BC, and CC. For the coexpression of lmrA or lmrB with lmrC in the heterologous host, lmrC with the ermEp promoter was cloned into PtipA expression vector pIJ6902 (65) (construct Cc2). All the above-mentioned vectors were prepared by restriction enzyme cloning.

In plasmid CEQ12, for expression of the lmrCEQ12 mutant, two mutations were introduced into the lmrC coding sequence: glutamate 167 was replaced with a codon for glutamine, and the parallel codon for glutamate 495 was replaced with a codon for glutamine. To test the putative terminator structure, a series of G-to-C and C-to-G point mutations were introduced into the lmrC upstream region in C-mCh vector, yielding plasmids pGBN120, pGBN121, and pGBN124. To test the function of uORFs 1 to 4, their START codons were mutated in C-mCh, yielding plasmids pGBN070 (uORF 1), pGBN106 (uORF 2), pGBN117 (uORF 3), and pGBN119 (uORF 4).

The data were processed by MassLynx V4.1 (Waters). UV chromatograms monitored at 194\u2009nm were used for lincomycin quantitation based on a five-point linear calibration curve, which was constructed from peak areas corresponding to lincomycin. Calibration solutions were prepared by spiking lincomycin authentic standard at the required concentration into lincomycin-free cultivation broth, extracted and preconcentrated as described above.

Tandem MS was performed by isolation at 1.5 m/z with the quadrupole, higher-energy C-trap dissociation fragmentation with a normalized collision energy of 30, and rapid scan MS analysis in the ion trap. The MS2 ion count target was set to 104, and the maximum injection time was 35\u2009ms. Only those precursors with charge states of 2 to 6 were sampled for MS2.

Enzyme specificity was set with the C terminus as Arg and Lys, also allowing cleavage at proline bonds and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was selected as a fixed modification, and N-terminal protein acetylation and methionine oxidation were selected as variable modifications. The \u201cmatch between runs\u201d feature of MaxQuant was used to transfer identifications to other LC-MS/MS runs based on their masses and retention time (maximum deviation, 0.7\u2009min), and this was also used in quantification experiments. Quantifications were performed with the label-free algorithms described recently. The obtained normalized data were imported to Perseus 1.6.1.3 software (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Munich, Germany) (71). All numeric values corresponding to protein intensity were transformed to a logarithmic scale, and all samples were grouped using categorical annotation. Missing values were then replaced by random numbers drawn from a normal distribution of 1.8 standard deviations (SD) downshift and with a width of 0.3 of each sample.

The dry membrane was recorded on ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad) at 600\u2009dpi, and the staining density for each complete lane was analyzed in ImageLab (Bio-Rad) or ImageJ software with an area outside the protein lanes defining the background. The signal intensities were normalized to the signal intensity of the induced BN3038 strain (for S. coelicolor) or BN3511 (for S. lincolnensis) transferred to the same membrane.", "Statistical analysis.", "The MIC, Western blot, and qRT-PCR results are expressed as the means \u00b1 the SD. Differences between two groups were analyzed using a two-sample t test (*, P\u2009<\u20090.05; **, P\u2009<\u20090.01; ***, P\u2009<\u20090.001; and P\u2009>\u20090.05 if not indicated). Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate unless otherwise stated.", "Antibodies.", "The anti-LmrC(2) antibody was generated by GenScript USA, Inc., by inoculating a New Zealand rabbit host strain with a peptide-KLH conjugate containing the LmrC peptide CLQRQAQESAGRAAS. The specificity of the LmrC antibody was validated using S. lincolnensis WT and \u0394C mycelium from 16-h seed cultures (see Fig.\u00a0S7c) grown in the absence or presence of lincomycin (LIN; 4\u2009mg liter\u22121) or clindamycin (CLI; 0.5\u2009mg liter\u22121) (see Fig.\u00a0S5a). The anti-m-Cherry antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (Cat PA5-34974) and AB Clonal. The ribosomal protein S7-specific antibody was obtained from Mee-Ngan F. Yap (72).", "Data availability.", "The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited at the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (73) partner repository with the data set identifier PXD026093.", "Strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this study (Excel file).
