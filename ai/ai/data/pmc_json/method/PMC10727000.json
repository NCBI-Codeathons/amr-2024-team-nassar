["Cloning Methods", "Three general methods were used to clone BGCs of interest for heterologous expression: DNA chemical synthesis or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by assembly, direct cloning from genomic DNA, and generation of random libraries (Fig.\u00a03). Various assembly methods were used to construct plasmids for expression, to perform promoter engineering, or to obtain complete BGCs from library clones. Information about library generation, direct cloning, and assembly methods can be found in references (Huo et al., 2019; W. Wang et al., 2021). Briefly, random libraries are collections of genomic DNA generated by fragmentation of the DNA followed by cloning of the DNA fragments in BAC or cosmid vectors. Direct cloning involves cloning the BGC of interest directly from genomic DNA but not using PCR. Instead, methods such as transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning or Cas12a-assisted precise targeted cloning using in vivo DNA circularization (CAPTURE) are used. Assembly methods include restriction enzyme mediated methods such as Golden Gate assembly, and recombination-based methods such as TAR cloning in yeast, Red/ET-mediated recombineering in bacteria, and in vitro Gibson assembly (Huo et al., 2019; W. Wang et al., 2021).", "DNA synthesis is advantageous for simplicity, if mutations are to be introduced, or if codon optimization is required. However, synthesis is practical only for small BGCs such as RiPPs since the maximum size that DNA synthesis suppliers currently offer is 1.8\u00a0kb for fragments and 5\u00a0kb for clonal DNA. Accordingly, DNA synthesis or PCR to amplify the BGC from genomic DNA was used in 87% of the studies expressing only RiPPs (Arias-Orozco et al., 2021; Ayikpoe et al., 2022; B\u00f6sch et al., 2020; Bothwell et al., 2021; Cao et al., 2021; Carson et al., 2023; Cheung-Lee et al., 2019; Cheung\u2010Lee et al., 2020; Gomez-Escribano et al., 2019; Kaweewan et al., 2021, 2023; Koos & Link, 2019; Mevaere et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2020; Thetsana et al., 2022; Unno et al., 2020; Vermeulen et al., 2022; X. Wang et al., 2023; Y. Zhang et al., 2022). TAR cloning, CAPTURE, and random library generation were used in the remaining studies (Ren et al., 2023; Santos-Aberturas et al., 2019; M. Xu et al., 2020a) (Fig.\u00a03).", "In contrast, random libraries and direct cloning techniques are often used for cloning of PKS, NRPS, and PKS-NRPS hybrids in line with the larger size of the BGCs compared to RiPPs. In fact, 88% of the studies aiming to express only PKS or NRPS used random library generation and or direct cloning, often in combination with assembly methods (Fig.\u00a03) (Alberti et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2023; Hashimoto et al., 2021; Hover et al., 2018; Lasch et al., 2021; Lasch, Gummerlich, et al., 2020, 2020; Libis et al., 2022; S. H. Liu et al., 2019; Y. Liu et al., 2021; Myronovskyi et al., 2018; Paulus et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; M. Xu et al., 2020b). For example, the libraries generated for the discovery of cadasides, malacindins, and miramides produced cosmids with portions of the desired BGCs. The overlapping pieces of the BGCs were then assembled into a BAC by TAR cloning and integrated into the chromosomes of the hosts (Hover et al., 2018; Paulus et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2019). Moreover, recombination methods like Red/ET can be used to introduce a selective marker (Lasch et al., 2021) or insert integration machinery into the vector (Gummerlich et al., 2020). Studies using random libraries used hosts related to the source organism to ensure the presence of regulatory elements necessary for BGC expression since the BGCs were often not refactored, except for two studies that engineered promoters (Gao et al., 2023; Lasch, Gummerlich, et al., 2020).", "In summary, while DNA synthesis is convenient for small BGCs, large BGCs are still technically challenging to obtain through synthesis. Random libraries can accommodate large pieces of DNA; however, much effort must be invested in finding clones that cover the whole BGC of interest. For example, Hashimoto et al. screened 1\u00a0536 BAC clones to identify the one leading to the production of the polyketide JBIR-159 (Hashimoto et al., 2021). Hover et al. and Libis et al. generated libraries of 25\u00a0000 and 60\u00a0000 clones, respectively (Hover et al., 2018; Libis et al., 2022). To facilitate analysis of such libraries, Hover et al. used barcoded primers and profiled the obtained clones with the bioinformatic platform eSNaPD (environmental Surveyor of Natural Product Diversity) (Hover et al., 2018). Libis et al. also used barcoded primers and analyzed their multigenome library with the targeted sequencing workflow CONKAT-seq (co-occurrence network analysis of targeted sequences) that uses co-occurrence patterns in libraries to identify chromosomally clustered domains thus increasing the probability of assembling complete BGCs from complex samples (Libis et al., 2019, 2022). In contrast, direct cloning methods are convenient as they allow targeted cloning of a BGC of interest but some, such as TAR cloning, have the limitation of not being suitable for BGCs that contain repetitive DNA sequences due to unwanted recombination that can result in BGC deletions. Cas-assisted excision from genomic DNA followed by in vitro assembly with a vector has been recently used to circumvent the drawbacks of TAR cloning (Enghiad et al., 2021; Montaser & Kelleher, 2020; J.-W. Wang et al., 2015)."]
