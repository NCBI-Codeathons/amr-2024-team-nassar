Animal care was carried out according to the \"International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals\", Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, 2010. Animal Research: Reporting of In vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines were also followed. Efforts were taken to minimize animals\u2019 suffering throughout all experimental procedures.", "One hundred and ninety six young adult male Wistar rats (250\u2013280 g) bred in the Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda Celular, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Mexico City, were used. Rats were housed in a controlled environment (temperature 22\u00b0C, lights on 06:00\u201318:00 h), two animals per cage with food (Purina chow LabDiet 5001) and water/sucrose solution (20%) ad libitum. Somatometric parameters were evaluated in all animals. Further, randomly selected batches of animals were used to analyze behavior, cardiovascular, metabolic and hormonal traits. All rats were used only once.", "Metabolic syndrome model", "In order to model MS, 8 weeks-old male rats (250\u2013280 g) were submitted to a 20% (w/v) sucrose solution treatment that was provided as beverage ad libitum for 24 weeks, as reported by Velasco et al., [26]. Tap water was given to control age-matched rats. Both, high-sucrose diet and control rats were fed throughout the experiment with standard rat chow composed of 28.5% protein, 13.5% fat, and 58% carbohydrates. Behavioral evaluations were carried out during the last week of the high-sucrose diet. It is important to clarify that the high-sucrose diet group only had the choice to drink the 20% sucrose solution. Fig 1 describes the experimental design used in this study.", "10.1371/journal.pone.0176554.g001Fig 1Experimental design.Timeline representing the experimental design utilized in this study; (B) representative picture of control and high-sucrose treated rats after 24 weeks of treatment.", "Experimental design.", "Timeline representing the experimental design utilized in this study; (B) representative picture of control and high-sucrose treated rats after 24 weeks of treatment.", "Behavioral procedures", "Behavioral evaluations were performed three days before obtaining biological samples to minimize stressful effects from the behavioral procedures over the metabolic parameters. It is worthy to mention that all animals that were evaluated behaviorally were also utilized to measure somatometric and metabolic parameters, such as glucose and insulin, whereas a sub-group of these animals was also evaluated for systolic blood pressure and cardiac frequency (see below).", "Animals were handled 5 min once a day for 3 or 4 consecutive days before testing. Rats were kept overnight in the experimental room in order to avoid context influences and to keep their basal anxiety levels as low as possible. Behavioral experiments were conducted between 10:00 and 16:00 h in a sound-attenuated room equipped with video-recording facilities. The devices used for the evaluation of behavior were placed beneath the video camera, and behavior was recorded in the absence of any observer. In all the experiments rats were assigned to each group [control or high-sucrose diet] and tested in a randomized manner. To understand the effects of long-term high-sucrose diet on anxiety-like behavior, three different paradigms were chosen to evaluate both active (SPBT; n = 18 control group/n = 17 high-sucrose diet group) and passive coping responses (EPM and OFT; n = 27 control group/n = 24 high-sucrose diet group) in our animals. Taking into account that a previous behavioral evaluation may influence the outcome of a subsequent test [33\u201335], and even have unpredictable effects on the state of some important receptors [36], EPM was carried out in animals that have never been behaviorally evaluated.", "Shock-probe/burying test", "The test was carried out as described by Treit et al. [37] and Fern\u00e1ndez-Guasti et al. [38]. The test was conducted in an acrylic cage (27 x 16 x 23 cm) with its floor covered with a uniform layer (5 cm) of fine sawdust. The cage was equipped with an electrified probe (7 cm long, 0.5 cm thick), which protruded from one of its walls 5 cm above the bedding and through which the rats received an electric shock (0.3 mA) any time they come into contact with the probe. The current was generated by a constant current shocker (LaFayette Instruments, Inc). During the test four parameters were recorded: the total amount of time that the rat spends burying the probe either with the forepaws or with the hind paws (burying behavior), the total amount of time that the rat spends lying or sitting with the body motionless except for tiny and slow lateral movements of the head or the ones needed for breathing (freezing behavior), time elapsed from the first shock to the start of the burying behavior (burying behavior latency), and the number of shocks received by the rat during the test.", "Elevated plus-maze", "The maze used in this work was based on the design of Pellow et al. [39] and was constructed as previously described [40] with slight modifications to allow obese rats to move freely. The maze consisted of two open arms (50 x 13 cm) divided in three quadrants and two enclosed arms (50 x 13 x 40 cm) with an open roof. The arms intersected at the central square (13 x 13 cm). The maze was elevated 50 cm from the floor by a pedestal joined to the central square. In order to avoid rats falling from the maze, wooden ledges (0.5 x 0.5 cm) were attached along the edges of the open arms. With the purpose to study to what extent animals explore the open arms of the maze, lines dividing its full length in three equal quadrants, were painted on their floor (see diagram in Table 1). Rats were placed on the central square of the maze facing an open arm at the beginning of the test, and were allowed to explore the maze for 5 min. The number of entries to the open arms (expressed as the percentage of the total number of arm entries), and the total time spent in these arms of the maze were taken as an anxiety index (the higher the index the lower anxiety). The total number of arms (open+closed) entries was taken as a measure of locomotion [39, 40]. An entry was counted when the four paws of the rat were placed in the respective arm. The maze was cleaned with detergent and dried before each trial. The illumination level at the central square of the maze was 5.1 lux during testing.", "Somatometric parameters measured in control and high-sucrose diet groups.", "Control group High-sucrose diet group.", "Body weight (g) 551 \u00b1 13 662 \u00b1 13 ***.", "Body length (cm) 27 \u00b1 0.2 27 \u00b1 0.2.", "Body mass index (Kg/m)2 7.7 \u00b1 0.2 9 \u00b1 0.2 ***.", "Abdominal circumference (cm) 22 \u00b1 0.3 25 \u00b1 0.3 ***.", "Total abdominal fat (g) 8.2 \u00b1 0.5 18 \u00b1 0.8 ***.", "Mean \u00b1 SEM; Student T-test", "*** P<0.001", "Open-field test", "Since time spent in the center of the open field is considered a measure related to anxiety [41], in order to further analyze this behavior, high-sucrose diet group and control rats were placed in an open field apparatus 1 min after being evaluated in the EPM. Evaluations were carried out in an arena (50 x 50 x 30 cm) divided into 25 squares (10 x 10 cm) as previously described [40]. Each rat was placed in the center of the arena and was allowed to explore it for 5 min. The time spent in the central squares of the arena, as well as the time that the rat spent in freezing behavior was quantified \u201coff-line\u201d. Freezing behavior was defined by the total amount of time that the rat spends lying or sitting with the body motionless except for tiny and slow lateral movements of the head or the ones needed for breathing. For measuring locomotion photoelectric cells were used to record the horizontal movements of the animals through the arena (OMNIALVA, Mexico City, Mexico). Each wall contained 10 photoelectric cells separated by 5 cm from each other that were located 4.0 cm above the arena. The box was interphased with a PC that allowed estimating quantitatively the distance traveled by the animal. Light intensity at the center of the arena was 138 lux.", "Somatometric parameters", "Somatometric and metabolic measurements were used to assess MS-like condition as reported previously [26]. Twenty-four weeks after high-sucrose diet, animals were fasted for 12 h and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) injection to obtain biological samples. The following parameters were measured, body weight, length (from the tip of the nose to the anus) and abdominal circumference (the diameter of the abdominal region just above the iliac crest). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (Kg)/length (m) 2. While the rats were still anesthetized, blood was taken from the inferior cava vein. Abdominal fat samples (peripancreatic and epididymal adipose tissue) were also obtained and weighted. After sample collecting, animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation.", "Blood pressure", "Blood pressure was measured in a sub-group of rats evaluated behaviorally (control group: n = 26/ high-sucrose diet: n = 26) between 21 and 22 weeks of treatment. The tail-cuff procedure was used to obtain systolic blood pressure (SBP) with a tail-cuff equipment (Landing, NJ USA). Animals were trained in several sessions before to practice the SBP measurement, which was done in awake rats. We performed an average of five readings to obtain individual SBP values. Normal SBP was considered between 110\u2013135 mm Hg, while hypertension was diagnosed when values were above 140 mm Hg.", "Metabolic parameters", "Blood samples from fasted animals were collected from the inferior cava vein in heparinized tubes and immediately centrifuged (1500 rpm during 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C) to obtain plasma. Samples were stored at -20\u00b0C until its posterior analysis. Plasma insulin level (n = 45 control group/n = 45 high-sucrose diet group) was determined with a Mercodia ultrasensitive rat insulin ELISA system and plasma glucose (n = 45 control group/n = 50 high-sucrose diet group) was measured with a glucose analysis kit (Quantichrom, BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA USA) as described before [26]. Separate groups of rats, not evaluated behaviorally but otherwise treated and handled in the same way were used for measuring: leptin, resistin, triglycerides and corticosterone. Triglycerides (n = 26 control group/n = 38 high-sucrose diet group) were determined by a photometric method (assays kits were manufactured by Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Levels of serum resistin and leptin (n = 26 control group/n = 38 high-sucrose diet group) were measured by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) with commercial kits: rat resistin ELISA kit (GenWay, Biotech, Inc. USA) and mouse leptin ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Inc. Minneapolis, USA), according to the manufacturers\u00b4 instructions, as previously reported [42\u201344]. Basal plasma corticosterone levels (n = 20 control group/n = 18 high-sucrose diet group) were quantified by radioimmunoassay [45] as using the Coat-A-Count\u00ae rat corticosterone kit and following the indications of the manufacturer.", "Statistical analysis", "All data are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM. Normal distribution was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Changes in either behavioral outcomes or somatometric and metabolic parameters were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test and the Student\u00b4s t-test, respectively. Fisher\u00b4s exact test was used to compare the extent of open arm exploration between groups. Significance was set at p<0.05. Statistical parameters were computed using GraphPad Prism 5 statistical software."]
