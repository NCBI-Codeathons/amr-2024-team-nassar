["Materials and Methods", "Plant Materials and Treatment", "Eight-year adult trees of the purple-red cultivar \u2018Royalty\u2019 and green cultivar \u2018Flame\u2019 were used as experimental materials. Plants were obtained from the ornamental crabapple germplasm nursery of the Beijing University of Agriculture, which is located in the Changping District of Beijing, and they were managed under the same environmental conditions and infected by rust fungi under natural conditions (without artificial infection).", "In the natural environment after the occurrence of rust, rust-infected leaves and normal leaves at the S1 (the early stage of rust infection with the scab obviously appeared in the leaf), S2 (the stage of aecidium appeared in the abaxial of the rust infected leaf), and S3 (the stage of aeciospore scattered in the rust infected leaf) rust developmental stages from 15 trees for each cultivar were sampled as one replicate for further tests. At least three replicates were performed for leaf collection. These samples were divided into 50 mL centrifuge tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80\u00b0C.", "Determination of Flavonoid Content", "Freeze-dried crabapple fruit samples were coarsely ground, and the powdered peel or flesh (0.8 g) from each sample was mixed with 10 mL of extract solution [methanol:water:formic acid:trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) = 70: 27: 2: 1] at 4\u00b0C in the dark for 72 h and shaken every 3 h. The liquid was then separated from the solid matrix via filtration through sheets of qualitative filter paper. The filtrate was further passed through 0.22 \u03bcm reinforced nylon membrane filters, and the filtrate was evaporated at 30\u00b0C and the residue was dissolved in 5 mL of water and purified by solid-phase extraction cartridge (500 mg, 3 ml) using C18 Supelclean ENVI-18 cartridge (Pretech Instruments, Sollentuna, Sweden). The cartridge was rinsed with water and methanol successively. Mobile phase A [TFA: formic acid: water (0.1: 2: 97.9)] and mobile phase B [TFA: formic acid: acetonitrile: water (0.1: 2: 48: 49.9)] were used to separate the anthocyanins from the flavonols via using an HPLC1100-DAD system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). The gradients were as follows: 0 min, 30% B; 10 min, 40% B; 50 min, 55% B; 70 min, 60% B; and 80 min, 30% B. Anthocyanin detection was performed at 520 nm, and flavonol detection was performed at 350 nm. All samples were analyzed using three replicates.", "Determination of Soluble Sugar Content", "Fresh samples (1 g DW) were extensively extracted three times in 5 mL 80% (v/v) ethanol at 80\u00b0C for 1 h. After extraction, the extracted liquid was mixed and evaporated to dryness in an evaporating dish over an 80\u00b0C water bath. The residues were re-dissolved in 1 mL ultrapure water and passed through 0.45 \u03bcM filters. Then, a 20 \u03bcL sample was injected into a HPLC system (Waters 600E) equipped with a carbohydrate column and an Alltech 2000ES evaporative light detector. A mixture of 80% ethanol and 20% ultrapure water (v/v) was used as the mobile phase, and the flow rate was set at 0.4 mL min-1. Fructose, glucose, sucrose and sorbital were identified and quantified from the retention times and peak heights of sugar standards purchased from Sigma. Each measurement was repeated three times.", "RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis and qPCR Assay", "Total RNA was extracted from the samples using the RNAiso reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (TIANGEN). Highly pure RNA samples (5 \u03bcg) with a ratio of 260/280 nm > 1.9 were DNase treated (TaKaRa) and reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using an oligo(dT)18 primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The synthesized cDNAs were then diluted to 4 ng/\u03bcL for the qPCR analysis. The qPCR assay (20 \u03bcL reactions: 9 \u03bcL SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTMII, 2 \u03bcL 10 \u03bcM each forward + reverse primer, 7 \u03bcL water, and 2 \u03bcL of 4 ng/\u03bcL cDNA) was conducted on a CFX96TM Real Time System (Bio-Rad). Differences in gene expression were calculated using the 2(-\u0394\u0394Ct) analysis method, and the transcription levels were determined via relative quantification using the Malus 18S ribosomal RNA gene as the reference gene. The primers for qPCR were designed as described in Table 1.", "Oligo primer sequence used for quantitative real-time PCR to determine the expression of Malus cv.

The samples were first extracted with ethanol (70%, final concentration) and then were dissolved in phosphate buffer (0.02 M, Sigma, United States) and the ELISA assays for ABA, JA, ETH and SA were performed on a 96-well microtitration plate. After adding the hormone standards (1 mg/mL, Sigma, United States), sample extracts and antibodies (1 mg/mL, Sigma, United States), the coated plates were incubated for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. After rinsing four times, 100 \u03bcL peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin was added to each well, and then the plate was incubated for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. A colorimetric substrate (phenylenediamine) was added to each well, and the reaction was halted by the addition of 3 M H2SO4. Absorbance at 490 nm was detected using an ELISA spectrophotometer and used to calculate the ABA and JA content. Absorbance at 450 nm was detected using an ELISA spectrophotometer and used to calculate the ETH content.
