RT-PCR analysis was carried out on the S. coelicolor RNA sample; cDNA was prepared using a Qiagen reverse transcription kit (Qiagen, Crawley, United Kingdom) and subjected to PCR, using the primer pairs listed in Table S1. pIJ12003a was used as a positive control, and RNA that had not been treated with reverse transcriptase was used as a negative control. The 5\u2032 ends of the tun transcripts present in both RNA samples were identified by using a 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit (version 2.0; Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, first-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using 5 \u03bcg of RNA, reverse transcriptase and the oligonucleotide primer RACE1 (Table S1). cDNA was purified using the SNAP columns provided in the kit, and poly(dC) tails were added to the 3\u2032 ends using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. PCR amplification of the tailed cDNA was initially carried out using the 5 \u2032 RACE abridged anchor primer with the first-strand primer RACE2 or RACE4 (Table S1). A dilution of the PCR mixture was then subjected to a second amplification using the abridged anchor primer with the second nested primer RACE3 or RACE5 (Table S1). The PCR product was gel-purified and a portion sequenced directly using the oligonucleotide RACE3 or RACE5 as primer.", "Gus assays.", "The DNA fragments to be assessed for promoter activity were cloned individually as XbaI-KpnI PCR fragments in pGUS (9) and cleaved with the same two restriction enzymes, and the resulting constructs were introduced into S. coelicolor M1152, M145, and M571 (\u0394relA mutant of M145; see reference 25) by conjugation, whereupon they integrated at the chromosomal \u03c6C31 attB sites of each strain. The ability of the cloned fragments to direct transcription of the uidA gene encoding \u03b2-glucuronidase (Gus) was determined by plating the exconjugants on R5 and SMMS agar medium (24) containing 0.16 mg/ml X-gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl beta-d-glucopyranosiduronic acid) (cyclohexylammonium salt; Gold Biotechnology).", "Construction of deletion mutants.", "To construct the tunACDEGHIJKLMN mutants, the 12.9-kb SacI fragment of pIJ12003a, a derivative of pRT802 (21), was first subcloned into pBlueScript II KS to give pBDW7. Gene deletions were made using the method of Gust et al. (2003) (14) by targeting pBDW7 with apramycin resistance gene (apr) replacement cassettes generated using the PCR primers listed in Table S1 and pIJ773 as the template DNA, and the cassettes were subsequently deleted using FLP recombinase to give in-frame deletion mutants; in all cases, the ribosome-binding site of the downstream gene was retained in the mutant construct. The SacI fragments from the resulting plasmids were subcloned into pRT802, and those with the fragment inserted in the same orientation as in pIJ12003a (determined by restriction enzyme digestion) were selected for further study. To construct the tunF mutant, pIJ12003a was targeted in the same manner (see Table S1 for the primers used) to yield the mutant derivative pIJ12542. Each of the mutated plasmids was introduced into E. coli ET12567/pR906 (17; David Figurski, personal communication) by transformation and then into S. coelicolor M1152 by conjugation.", "Complementation of deletion mutants.", "A PCR fragment was generated for selected deleted tun genes using the primers in Table S1, pIJ12003a DNA as the template, and Phusion High Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs Inc.). The PCR products for tunACDEGHIJK were cleaved with NdeI and PacI and inserted into pIJ12251 (20) cut with the same restriction enzymes. The PCR product for tunF was cleaved with NdeI and HindIII and inserted downstream of the ermE* promoter of pIJ10257 (19) that had been cut with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and the ermE*p::tunF fragment ligated into pSET152 (22) that had been similarly treated to give pIJ12544. All of the individual complementation constructs, which were confirmed by DNA sequencing, were introduced into E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 (16) by transformation and then into the appropriate S. coelicolor deletion strain by conjugation.", "Bioassays for tunicamycin production.", "Lawns of the strains to be assayed were made by spreading approximately 107 spores in 100 \u03bcl of water on R5 agar plates, followed by incubation at 30\u00b0C for 48 h. Soft nutrient agar (SNA) was melted, cooled to 55\u00b0C, and inoculated with a one-tenth volume of a mid-logarithmic growth culture of B. subtilis EC1524. Cylindrical plugs (approximately 8 mm in diameter) were cut from the Streptomyces lawns using a cork borer and were either set into or laid on top of 40 ml of the SNA inoculated with B. subtilis EC1524 in a 10-cm2 plastic petri dish, which was then incubated overnight at 30\u00b0C.", "Analysis of immunity to tunicamycin.", "Lawns of the strains to be assayed were made by spreading approximately 107 spores in 100 \u03bcl of water onto R5 plates, which were allowed to dry for 20 min.
