["Materials and Methods", "Origin and Cultivation of Organisms", "Source of Strains", "Paracoccus marcusii CP157, used here as a model strain to study its potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites, originates from a diseased spot on the carapace of a CP specimen. Further 17 Paracoccus spp. from diverse habitats (Supplementary Table 1) were screened for production of secondary metabolites. Nine of these Paracoccus spp. were obtained from culture collections and are type strains of the respective species. Bioactivity of bacteria and their culture extracts were tested against bacterial target strains from four different classes, i.e,. Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Flavobacteriia as well as the two diatoms Skeletonema marinoi CCMP 1332, Thalassiosira rotula CCMP 1647 and larvae of the crustacean Artemia salina. An overview of all organisms used in this study and their origin is given in Supplementary Table 1.", "Routine Cultivation of Organisms", "All bacterial strains were routinely cultivated in marine broth (MB) medium with modifications given by Beyersmann et al. (2017). Only the type strain of Paracoccus alcaliphilus was grown in DSMZ medium 7721. If not stated otherwise, incubations were carried out in in the dark at 20\u00b0C and 100 rpm. Growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD600 nm). Agar plates were prepared with 1.7% (w/v) agar and incubated at room temperature. For cultivation of bacteria in defined medium, artificial sea water medium (ASW, Zech et al., 2009) was supplemented with a single carbon source. Substrates were sterile filtered and added after autoclaving. Adaptation of bacteria to defined medium was achieved via two transfers: the first pre-culture was set up in ASW + MB (10%). Subsequently, cells were transferred to ASW + substrate and incubated for 2 days before inoculation of the main cultures.", "Axenic cultures of diatoms were cultivated without shaking at 15\u00b0C in a 12 h light/12 h dark diurnal cycle in another artificial sea water medium (ESAW, Harrison et al., 1980). Algal growth was monitored by measuring autofluorescence of chlorophyll in a microplate reader (Spark, Tecan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland) at 488 nm excitation and 680 nm emission wavelength.", "Artemia salina larvae were hatched from a ready-to-use mixture of eggs, sea salts, and microalgae (ArtemioMix, JBL GmbH & Co. KG, Neuhofen, Germany). Subsequently, larvae were transferred to a 12-well plate containing 3 ml ESAW and algal culture for nutrient supply.", "Sequencing and Analysis of the Paracoccus marcusii CP157 Genome", "Genome sequencing of CP157", "DNA was isolated from CP157 using a Qiagen Genomic-tip 100/G (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A SMRTbellTM (PacificBiosciences, Menlo Park, CA, United States) template library was prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, for preparation of 15 kb libraries 5 \u03bcg genomic DNA were end-repaired and ligated overnight to hairpin adapters applying components from the DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit P6 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, United States). Reactions were carried out and BluePippinTM Size-Selection was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, United States). Conditions for annealing of sequencing primers and binding of polymerase to purified SMRTbellTM template were assessed with the Calculator in RS Remote. SMRT sequencing was carried out on the PacBio RSII, taking one 240-min movie on a single SMRT cell, resulting in 58,447 post-filtered reads with a mean read length of 5,392 bp. Libraries for sequencing on the Illumina platform were prepared with the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit, with modifications (Baym et al., 2015), and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeqTM (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States), leading to 566,300 Mio reads of 2 \u00d7 300 bp. Long read genome assembly was performed with the \u201cRS_HGAP_Assembly.3\u201d protocol included in SMRTPortal version 2.3.0 using default parameters, with exception of the target genome size, which was increased to 10 Mbp. In order to screen for additional plasmids, an independent short read assembly was performed using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) and SpaDES 3.14 (Bankevich et al., 2012). The replicons were circularized, particularly artificial redundancies at the ends were removed and adjusted to the replication genes. Identification of redundancies and replication genes was done via BLAST. Circularization and rotation to the replication genes was performed by genomecirculator.jar tool2. Error-correction was performed by mapping Illumina short reads onto finished genomes using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment bwa 0.6.2 in paired-end mode using default settings (Li and Durbin, 2009), with subsequent variant and consensus calling using VarScan 2.3.6 (Koboldt et al., 2012). Genome annotation is based on Prokka 1.13 (Seemann, 2014) with subsequent manual curation. The complete genome is deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers CP065892-CP065914. The genome of P. marcusii DSM 11547T was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeqTM as described above for means of taxonomic delineation only. Raw reads were deposited in NCBI SRA under accession number PRJNA693451.", "Analysis of the CP157 genome and identification of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters", "Assignment of COG categories was achieved using the eggNOG-mapper v2 (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2019). For detection of biosynthetic gene clusters (BSGCs) the online tool antiSMASH 5.2 (Blin et al., 2019) was applied. Settings were kept in default and the algorithm was run in strict mode. The obtained hits were compared with existent entries for Paracoccus spp. in the antiSMASH database. Genes identified as core biosynthetic genes were further investigated by pBLAST of the amino acid sequence. To identify potential regions of horizontal origin or putative genomic islands, the genome of CP157 was uploaded to IslandViewer 4 (Bertelli et al., 2017). Regions containing prophages or remnants of such were identified with PHASTER (Arndt et al., 2016). Screening for gene transfer agents (GTAs) was done via BLAST against known GTA genes. Therefore, the respective amino acid sequences of GTA genes from Paracoccus seriniphilus (Ga0192381_102327; Ga0192381_12519), Paracoccus sp. S4493 (Ga0308526_100156; Ga0308526_103914), Paracoccus sp. PAMC 22219 (Ga0098299_100157), and Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL-12 (Dshi_2174) were downloaded from IMG/M (Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes) and used as query sequences for pBLAST against the CP157 genome."]
