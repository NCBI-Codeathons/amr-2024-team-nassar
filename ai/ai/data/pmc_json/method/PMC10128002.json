Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on the PROXIMA 2 beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility (Saint-Aubin, France). Data processing was performed using the XDS package (84) (Table\u00a0S4). Because of the diffraction anisotropy, the DEBYE and STARANISO programs developed by Global Phasing Ltd. were applied to the data scaled with AIMLESS using the STARANISO server (http://staraniso.globalphasing.org). These programs perform an anisotropic cutoff of merge intensity data on the basis of an analysis of local I/\u03c3(I); compute Bayesian estimates of structure amplitudes, taking into account their anisotropic falloff; and apply an anisotropic correction to the data.

Inspection of the resulting model using COOT (86) showed strong electron density maps at the interface of the lobes, which were attributed to peptides likely coming from protein degradation during overexpression. The backbones of the short peptide ligands (2- and 5-amino-acid peptides) were modeled at two different places of the interface based on the electron density. Electron density for peptide side chains was more ambiguous, and no electron density linking the two short bound peptides was present, indicating that a population of different peptides might be present in the ligand-binding site of YejASm molecules within the crystal.
