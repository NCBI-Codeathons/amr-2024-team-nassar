["3.1. General Experimental Procedures", "Optical rotation was determined on a JACS P-1010 polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet IR100 FTIR spectrometer. LRESIMS were recorded on Agilent 1100 series LC with MSD 1946 (LC/MS). NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz spectrometer, equipped with a 5 mm TXI probe, with the residual solvent used as an internal standard (CDCl3: \u03b4H 7.26, \u03b4C 77.06) [45]. Semi-preparative HPLC was performed with an Agilent 1100 Infinity HPLC system equipped with photodiode array detectors. Semi-preparative HPLC and analysis by LRESIMS used a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm). All solvents (analytical grade, LCMS grade, and HPLC grade) were from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., Fisher Scientific, and VWR International."]
