["Materials and Methods", "General Experimental Procedures", "Optical rotations were measured on an Autopol VI manufactured by Rudolph Research Analytical, Hackettstown, NJ, United States IR spectra were measured on a Nicolet iS10 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) with KBr disks. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 (\u03b4\nH 7.26 ppm, \u03b4\nC 77.16\u00a0ppm) or DMSO-d\n6 (\u03b4\nH 2.50\u00a0ppm, \u03b4\nC 39.52\u00a0ppm) using Bruker Avance III 600 or 800\u00a0MHz spectrometers (Bruker Corp, Switzerland). HR-ESI-MS analysis were carried out on a Shimadzu UPLC-IT-TOF mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corp, Japan). Silica gel (100\u2013200 mesh and 200\u2013300 mesh, Qingdao Marine Chemical Inc, China) and Sephadex LH-20 (18\u2013111\u00a0\u03bcm, Pharmacia Biotech Ltd, Sweden) were used for the chromatography column (CC). Precoated silica gel GF254 plates (0.20\u20130.25\u00a0mm in thickness, Qingdao Marine Chemical Inc, China) were used for thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analyses. Semipreparative HPLC was conducted on a Hitachi Chromaster system (Hitachi Ltd, Japan), equipped with a DAD detector and a YMC-Triart C18 column (250 \u00d7 10.0\u00a0mm i. d, 5\u00a0\u03bcm), using a flow rate of 3.0\u00a0ml/min at a column temperature at 28\u00b0C, and 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid was added to each HPLC mobile phase.", "Strain Isolation and Cultivation", "Strain S. candelabrum KIB-int20 was isolated from the stems of tea trees (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze) from Dali, Yunnan Province, China. It was identified as S. candelabrum by a combination of ITS sequence and fungal morphological identification. The internal transcribed spaces (ITS) region was amplified and sequenced using the general primers ITS1 (5\u2032-TCC\u200bGTA\u200bGGT\u200bGAA\u200bCCT\u200bGCG\u200bG-3\u2032) and ITS4 (5\u2032-TCC\u200bTCC\u200bGCT\u200bTAT\u200bTGA\u200bTAT\u200bGC-3\u2032). The ITS region of the fungus was a 605 bp DNA sequence (GenBank No. OK445701), which showed 99% identity to the ITS sequence of strain S. candelabrum (GenBank No. LM652483.1).", "S. candelabrum KIB-int20 was first inoculated on a PDA (filtrate of boiled fresh potatoes 200\u00a0g/L, dextrose 20\u00a0g/L, agar 20\u00a0g/L) plate for 5 days, and then transferred to several PDA plates for another 7\u00a0days culture. About one-sixth of agar blocks with fungi mycelium was inoculated into a tissue culture vessel (370\u00a0ml) containing the fermentation medium. For each tissue culture vessel, 20\u00a0g cargo rice, 10\u00a0g peptone and 12\u00a0ml water were added and sterilized at 121\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min immediately. The inoculated medium was statically cultivated for 1\u00a0month in a dark environment at room temperature. Strain S. candelabrum KIB-int20 was finally fermented with 5\u00a0kg of cargo rice in total.", "Extraction and Isolation", "The fermentation solid of S. candelabrum KIB-int20 was extracted with acetone (10\u00a0L\u00d72, d\u00d72) at room temperature. The extracts were concentrated to remove organic solvent. The aqueous residue was then partitioned with EtOAc (2.5\u00a0L\u00d74) to obtain an oily crude extract (50\u00a0g). The extract was then subjected to silica gel CC eluting with petroleum ether\u2212EtOAc (1:0, 10:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10 and 0:1, v/v) to give nine fractions (A\u2212I). An antifungal screening of each fraction against C. albicans was conducted, and fraction D turned out to be active. The main metabolites in each fraction were further analyzed by DAD-HPLC. Main metabolites in fractions D and E shared the same UV absorptions. In this way, fractions D and E were selected for further study. Selected fraction E (petroleum ether\u2212EtOAc 1:1) was first separated by Sephadex LH-20 CC (CH2Cl2\u2212CH3OH, 1:1), and divide it into six subfractions according to the detection results of thin layer chromatography (10% ethanol sulfate in EtOH was served as chromogenic agent). Further purification of these subfractions by semipreparative DAD-HPLC gave compounds 2 (78% methanol in H2O, t\nR = 19.8\u00a0min, 3.5\u00a0mg), 3 (78% methanol in H2O, t\nR = 33.0\u00a0min, 3.5\u00a0mg), 4 (78% methanol in H2O, t\nR = 38.0\u00a0min, 6.4\u00a0mg), and 5 (78% methanol in H2O, t\nR = 50.0\u00a0min, 5.4\u00a0mg). Another selected fraction D (petroleum ether\u2212EtOAc, 2:1) was sequentially subjected to Sephadex LH-20 CC (CH2Cl2\u2212CH3OH, 1:1) and semipreparative DAD-HPLC to afford 1 (65% methanol in H2O, t\nR = 32.5\u00a0min, 8.2\u00a0mg), 6 (65% methanol in H2O, t\nR = 34\u00a0min, 6.9\u00a0mg), and 7 (65% methanol in H2O, t\nR = 42.0\u00a0min, 4.4\u00a0mg).", "Fusariumester C (2): colorless oil [\u03b1]19.9\nD 4.5 (c 0.2, MeOH) UV (MeOH); \u03bbmax (log \u03b5) 196 (3.99), 232 (3.59), 269 (3.93)\u00a0nm; IR (KBr) \u03bdmax 3,419, 2,927, 2,856, 1712, 1,620, 1,382, 1,250, 1,176\u00a0cm\u208b1.

Compound 1, nystatin (positive control) and equivalent methanol (blank control) were dispensed in single wells and mixed with diluted fungal inoculum to make the final concentrations of tested compounds were 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320\u00a0\u03bcg/ml in a single well, respectively. After 48\u00a0h of shaking culture at 37\u00b0C and 200\u00a0r/min, the results were determined visually. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration where there was no visible growth of C. albicans. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate.", "Measurement of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) Values (Weidenborner et al., 1990): The IC50 of compound 1 against E. turcicum was evaluated using 48-well culture plates. The conidia used in these experiments were collected from the 7-day-old culture of fungi grown on PDA. The conidia were collected and the suspension was diluted with sterile water and mix 1:1 with PDB (filtrate of boiled fresh potatoes 200\u00a0g/L, dextrose 20\u00a0g/L) solution for activity test. 1\u00a0ml 1/2 PDB spore suspension was added to single wells, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32\u00a0\u03bcL compound 1 or cycloheximide (10\u00a0mg/ml) was added to make the final concentration is 9.99\u2013310.07\u00a0\u03bcg/ml in a single well. After the 48-well plate was cultured at 200\u00a0r/min and 30\u00b0C for 7\u00a0days, the mycelium at each concentration were collected, dried and weighed. The inhibition rates were treated by nonlinear regression analysis of logistic dose\u2013respond curves (Graph Pad Prism eight statistic software) to get the IC50 value."]
