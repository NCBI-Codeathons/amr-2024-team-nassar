["Methods", "Bioinformatics analyses", "Transport proteins encoded within the genomes of B. cereus ATCC 14579, B. anthracis Ames and B. thuringiensis konkukian 97\u201327, were identified using the Transporter Automated Annotation Pipeline (TransAAP) [21]. This pipeline predicts the complete complement of transporters encoded by an organism based on the annotated amino acid sequences within its genome sequence by running a variety of searches including BLASTP (to the Transporter Classification Database\u2014TCDB, TransAAP and GenBank databases), HMM, Pfam, TIGRfam HMM and COG searches, as well as other analyses such as TMHMM hydropathy prediction [21]. Efflux proteins were identified in the TransAAP output and manually curated for a likely role in the efflux of drugs or small molecules.", "To broadly examine the conservation of putative efflux systems between the B. cereus type strain ATCC 14579 and other strains within the B. cereus group, we conducted reciprocal best-match BLASTP 2.2.28+ analyses. Searches between all CDSs annotated in the ATCC 14579 genome and 168 other B. cereus group strains listed in the RefSeq database with assembly level \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201cchromosome\u201d (August 2016; S1 Table) were executed through the Proteinortho tool [22]. Putative orthologs/paralogs were identified as reciprocal best-match BLASTP hits that recorded an e-value below 1e-50, and greater than 50% coverage. Since these analyses used annotated amino acid sequences as input, no pseudogenes were analysed.", "Antimicrobial exposure, stress treatments and RNA isolation", "Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) towards B. cereus ATCC 14579 for chloramphenicol, kanamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and ethidium bromide were previously determined [23], and MIC values for norfloxacin, 2,2\u2019-dipyridyl, tannic acid, Dominulin B and a crude ethanol surface extract of a social paper wasp, Polistes humilis [24], were determined using the same method.", "MH broth was inoculated with a 1% inoculum of an overnight culture of B. cereus ATCC 14579 and grown at 30\u00b0C with shaking to an OD600 of approximately 0.8. The culture was then diluted in MH broth to OD600 = 0.1, and grown as before to an OD600 of approximately 0.8. The culture was then split and the compound (or crude wasp ethanol extract) used for antimicrobial exposure treatment was added at a concentration equivalent to 50% of the respective MIC to separate cultures. An untreated culture was included as a control. The cultures were further grown for 20 minutes. Bacterial cells were harvested by incubating cultures in an equal volume of ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes before centrifugation at 4000 x g for 5 minutes. Pellets were stored at -80\u00b0C.", "For extraction of RNA, cells were lysed using Lysing Matrix B and a FastPrep instrument (both MP Biomedicals), and RNA was isolated using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) or the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion) as described, followed by a second round of purification using one of the RNA Mini Kits. RNA concentration and purity were measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer.", "Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)", "cDNA synthesis was performed in duplicate for each RNA sample, using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) or the Quantitect cDNA synthesis Kit (QIAGEN) and respective protocols, with 1\u03bcg RNA. qPCR reactions were performed on a MasterCycler realplex4 (Eppendorf) in a 96-well microtiterplate format and a final volume of 5\u03bcl using 1\u03bcl cDNA diluted 1:20, 2.5\u03bcl 2\u00d7GoTaq qPCR master mix (Promega) and 0.2\u03bcM of each primer. In qPCR experiments studying gene expression in cells exposed to wasp ethanol extract or Dominulin B, qPCR was performed in 200 ul thin-walled tubes and a final volume of 10\u03bcl, using 5.0\u03bcl 2\u00d7GoTaq qPCR master mix. Cycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 seconds, 55\u00b0C for 10 seconds, and 68\u00b0C for 8 seconds, followed by a melting curve analysis, which resulted in single product specific melting temperatures for all samples. Control qPCR reactions using DNase-treated RNA diluted to 0.005\u03bcg/\u03bcl as the template confirmed the absence of amplification of contaminating DNA.", "Conserved putative MDR efflux pumps were selected for qPCR analysis after the stress treatments. After one round of qPCR only those conserved MFS and ABC genes that showed above 3-fold differential expression in at least one of the stress conditions were included in the further qPCR analysis (13 MFS and 6 ABC). In addition all the efflux pumps belonging to the RND, SMR and MATE families were included (three or four from each family).", "The BC1744 helicase gene was selected for use as the reference gene. The list of primers used is given in S2 Table. For gene expression analysis, the quantification cycle (Cq) values were determined using the realplex software (Eppendorf). Cq values were transformed into linear scale expression quantities using the formula ECq [25]. The expression of each target gene was normalized to that obtained for the helicase reference gene reaction run on the same plate. Then, for each target gene, the expression ratio between the untreated and antimicrobial treated samples was calculated (\u0394\u0394-Cq-method) [25] and finally the values obtained for the two technical replicates were averaged.", "Biofilm formation", "The biofilm forming capabilities of B. cereus ATCC 14579 wild type and isogenic markerless gene deletion mutant strains were investigated with a microplate screening assay modified from a previously described method [26]. Precultures were grown in Y1 minimal medium [27] at 3\u00b0C to early exponential growth (optical density at 600 nm (OD600) ~ 0.3) and were then used to inoculate fresh Y1 medium to an OD600 of 0.01. For each strain, sixteen wells of a 96-well polystyrene microplate (Corning 3788) were filled with 125 \u03bcl of the bacterial suspension. The plates were produced in duplicate and each plate contained eight wells of Y1 medium as a negative control. Following incubation at 20\u00b0C for 48 h and 72 h, respectively, the wells of each microplate were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with a 0.1% (w/v) aqueous solution of methyl violet 6B for 30 min at room temperature. Wells were then washed three times with PBS and dried upside down over night. To quantify biofilm formation the dye was solubilized by incubating the wells with 150 \u03bcl of a 1:4 acetone/ethanol mixture for 10 min at room temperature, and subsequently absorbance at 570 nm was determined."]
