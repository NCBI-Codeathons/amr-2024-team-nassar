["Methods", "Bacteria and culture conditions", "The bacterial strains used in this study, B. thailandensis E264 (ATCC) [24] and B. pseudomallei 1026b [43], were grown in Nutrient Broth (NB; EMD Chemicals) supplemented with 4% glycerol (Fisher) at 34\u00b0C on a rotary shaker, unless otherwise stated. Escherichia coli SM10 \u03bbpir (thi-1 thr leu tonA lacY supE recA::RP4-2-Tc::Mu Kmr \u03bbpir) served as a donor for conjugation experiments and was grown in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Difco) under the same conditions [44]. When necessary, 150 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline or 100 \u03bcg/ml trimethoprim was added for B. thailandensis mutant selection.", "To follow the production of rhamnolipids by B. thailandensis and its \u0394rhlA mutants, cultures were grown in 50 ml of NB supplemented with 2% glycerol in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 37\u00b0C with gyratory shaking (240 rpm). For B. pseudomallei, cultures were carried out in 25 ml of NB supplemented with 4% glycerol in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 34\u00b0C with gyratory shaking (200 rpm).", "Rhamnolipid production and extraction", "Cultures for high yield rhamnolipid production were grown in 200 ml of NB supplemented with 4% of glycerol or canola oil in 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks at 34\u00b0C with gyratory shaking (240 rpm). Extraction of total rhamnolipids was performed as described previously [16], with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were removed from the medium by centrifugation (13,000 \u00d7 g, 15 min) and the supernatant acidified to pH 3-4 with concentrated HCl. The rhamnolipids were then extracted three times with 1/3 of the volume of ethyl acetate. The organic extract was then dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The oily residue was finally dissolved in methanol.", "Construction of \u0394rhlA mutants", "For the construction of single \u0394rhlA mutants in B. thailandensis, a 464 bp fragment was amplified using primers rhlASVF and rhlASVR, containing XbaI and KpnI restriction sites, respectively (Table 3). The PCR product was cloned by the means of its XbaI and KpnI sites into the suicide vector pKNOCK-Tc [45]. The construct was transformed into competent E. coli SM10 cells by the heat shock method. The plasmid was then mobilized into B. thailandensis by mating and transformants were selected on TSB agar plates containing 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin, 15 \u03bcg/ml polymyxin B and 150 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline. To verify in which of the two rhlA alleles the homologous recombination took place, diagnostic PCRs were conducted using promoter-specific forward primers, rhlA1PF and rhlA2PF, as well as a common reverse primer, rhlAR, located at the end of the 3' regions of both rhlAs. Rhamnolipid production of mutants was also quantified (see below) and compared to typical wild type production values.", "Primers used in this study", "Primer Name Primer Sequence (5' to 3').", "rhlASVF GCTCTAGAAGACGGTCATCCTCGTGAAC1.", "rhlASVR GGGGTACCCGGCAGCTTCGTCAGATAC1.", "rhlA1PF GGAAATGGTCGATGGGTATG2.", "rhlA2PF GGCGACGGATAGCGATAAG2.", "rhlAR TCGTGTACTCGTCCAGCTC.", "rhlATp1F GGCGGAATTCCGGCAGGTACTGCTCCGGCCGCATCGACAGGATCTGGTCCGAGCTCGAATTAGCTTCAAA.", "rhlATp1R TGCCGCGGATCATGAAGCTGTACAACTACCGGTATCTGACGAAGCTGCCGGAGCTCGAATTGGGGATCTT.", "rhlA5'2F GTGGTCGTGAAAGCGGAAT.", "rhlA5'2R CGGCAGCTTCGTCAGATAC.", "rhlA3'3F GACCAGATCCTGTCGATGC.", "rhlA3'3R CTCGATCAGCGTCATCAGC.", "1 Restriction sites designed into the primers are underlined.", "2 Primers are constructed upward of the consensus sequence of the two promoters.", "To inactivate the second rhlA allele, targeted mutagenesis through natural transformation of PCR fragments was exploited [46]. Briefly, three fragments corresponding to the regions flanking the specific rhlA gene to be deleted and a trimethoprim resistance gene were joined by PCR. The 5' and 3' flanking regions of rhlA were amplified using primers rhlA5'2F and rhlA5'2R as well as rhlA3'3F and rhlA3'3R, respectively. The trimethoprim resistance marker was amplified from the pFTP1 plasmid (a gift from H. P. Schweizer, Colorado State University) using primers rhlATp1F and rhlATp1R [47,48]. Cells of the single \u0394rhlA mutant were rendered competent using DM medium and then exposed to various concentrations of the mutagenic PCR fragment. Double \u0394rhlA mutants were selected on TSB agar containing 150 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline and 100 \u03bcg/ml trimethoprim. The B. thailandensis \u0394rhlA double mutant was confirmed by diagnostic PCR to verify proper recombination and insertion of the resistance marker. Absence of rhamnolipid production by LC/MS analysis also served as a confirmation.", "Preparation of culture samples for LC/MS analysis", "To prepare samples for LC/MS analysis, the culture samples were firstly centrifuged to remove cells (16,000 \u00d7 g, 15 min). To the cell-free supernatant was then added either 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid or deuterium-labeled 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ-D4) [49] as internal standards used for quantitative measurements, both at a final concentration of 10 mg/L. For the highly pathogenic B. pseudomallei, cell-free supernatants were obtained by centrifugation (16,000 \u00d7 g, 15 min) followed by filtration on a 0.22 \u03bcm filter. Twenty \u03bcl of samples were injected for LC/MS analysis. Quantification was performed by integration of the pseudomolecular and the proper fragment ions and the use of dose-response calibration curves using purified rhamnolipids.", "Rhamnolipid analysis (LC/MS)", "All rhamnolipid quantifications and analyses were performed using a Quattro II (Waters, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in negative electrospray ionization mode coupled to an HP 1100 (Agilent Technologies, Saint Laurent, Quebec, Canada) high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a 4.6 \u00d7 50 mm 300SB-C3 Zorbax 5 \u03bcm (Agilent) reverse-phase column. The HPLC flow rate was set at 400 \u03bcl/min and was split to 10% by the means of a Valco Tee prior to being introduced into the mass spectrometer. An acetonitrile-water gradient containing 2 mM of ammonium acetate was used starting with 25% acetonitrile during the first 5 min, raised to 50% by 18 min and 100% by 19 min. This concentration was held until 22 min, where the initial concentration was resumed and kept until 26 min. Voltage of the capillary was set to 3.5 kV and cone voltage to 30 V. The temperature of the source block was kept at 120\u00b0C. Scan mass range was set from 130 to 940 Da. A calibration curve was performed to determine the long chain rhamnolipid response factor. During LC/MS/MS experimentation, fragmentation of the molecules were induced with argon serving as the collision gas at 2 \u00d7 10-3 mTorr.", "Enzymatic hydrolysis of rhamnolipids - Naringinase", "To study the rhamnolipid congeners produced by B. thailandensis, a modified protocol using enzymatic hydrolysis was employed, as described previously [30]. Briefly, 100 mg of extracted and purified rhamnolipids were suspended in 5 ml of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.1. To this solution was added 100 mg of naringinase from Penicillum decumbens (Sigma). The mixture was then kept at 50\u00b0C for 2 h with gyratory shaking (240 rpm), at which point 20 ml of buffer were added. After 24 h, another 150 mg of naringinase were added as well as 25 ml of buffer. The reaction was kept under these conditions for 8 days. A final 50 mg of naringinase in 20 ml of buffer were added to the mixture and was left for another 24 h. Thereafter, the solution was acidified to pH 3-4 using concentrated HCl and extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The fatty acid moieties generated by naringinase cleavage were then analyzed by LC/MS after the extract had been dried and evaporated.", "CMC - Surface tension assay", "Critical micelle concentration and surface tension were measured by the du No\u00fcy ring method [50] using a surface tensiometer (Fisher). The instrument was calibrated against water and assays were performed in triplicate at room temperature.", "Swarming motility", "For swarming assays, cultures were grown overnight, diluted in fresh medium and subcultured until OD600~6.0 was reached. Swarm plates were prepared as follows: freshly autoclaved medium consisting of NB supplemented with 0.5% dextrose (Fisher) and 0.5% Bacto-agar (Difco) was poured into standard Petri dishes and dried under laminar flow for 30 min, as before [42]. Immediately following the drying period, plates were inoculated at their center with 5 \u03bcl of bacterial culture and placed at 30\u00b0C.", "For swarming phenotype restoration, 1, 5, 10 and 25 mg/L of purified B. thailandensis E264 rhamnolipids were deposited (10 \u03bcl) at the center of respective plates and left to dry for 15 minutes before spot inoculation with swarming-deficient \u0394rhlA mutant strains. For cross-feeding experiments, either equal parts of the cultures were mixed before being plated at the center on the swarm plate, or cultures were simply spotted side-by-side."]
