The seed culture mixture was continuously transferred to fresh seed medium 2 times, diluted on a solid plate to obtain single colonies, and cultured for doxorubicin production in shake flasks. The strain with the highest yield of doxorubicin was selected for the next round of screening. The concentration of doxorubicin in the seed medium was gradually increased from 50\u00a0mg/L to 100\u00a0mg/L and 150\u00a0mg/L to obtain doxorubicin-resistant strains.", "Intergeneric conjugal transfer of plasmid from E.

Mycelia (1.0\u00a0cm \u00d7 1.5\u00a0cm) were picked and inoculated into seed media for 2 days, after which 10% of the inoculum was transferred to tryptic soy broth (TSB) media for culture for 20\u201324\u00a0h. E. coli S17-1 was cultured overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in 5 mL LB tubes, after which 2% of the inoculum was cultured in 50 mL LB shake flasks. When the OD of E. coli reached 0.4\u20130.6, mixed cultures of Streptomyces and E. coli were incubated in RP media (soluble starch, 2.0%; soybean powder, 1.0%; valine, 0.05%; NaCl, 0.2%; KH2PO4, 0.05%; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1%; MgCl2.6H2O, 1.6%; agar, 2.0%; CaCO3, 0.3%).

These plates were further incubated in a 28\u00a0\u00b0C incubator for 5\u20137 days, after which apramycin-resistant colonies were picked for PCR validation.", "Strain construction", "The knockout strains \u25b3U1, \u25b3H4 and \u25b3X1 were derived from SIPI-7-14 with the deletion of a 351\u00a0bp, 783\u00a0bp and 1221\u00a0bp fragment on the gene dnrU, dnrH and dnrX, respectively. The constructed \u25b3U1 knockout mutant strain was used as an example. The S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 genome was used as a template to obtain the 1121\u00a0bp upstream and 1450\u00a0bp downstream homology arms of dnrU by PCR amplification with the primers dnrU-UP-F/R and dnrU-DOWN-F/R. The upstream and downstream homology arms were fused together by overlapping PCR with the primers dnrU-UP-F/dnrU-DOWN-R. The PCR product was digested with HindIII/XbaI and then assembled on the pSET vector to construct the plasmid pSET-\u25b3dnrU (Additional file: Fig. S2a), which was used to delete the dnrU gene. The well-established plasmid was subsequently transformed into S17-1, which was subsequently conjugated with strain SIPI-7-14. The colonies that were apramycin resistant were regarded as the integrating mutants, in which the first homologous single-crossover occurred. The resulting mutants were then subcultured six times in TSB medium without the antibiotic apramycin and diluted to spread on SP plates. The colonies that were phenotypically sensitive to apramycin were selected. The primers \u0394dnrU F/R were used for colony PCR verification. The PCR products were subsequently sequenced by GENEWIZ for verification, and all primers were synthesized by Jie Li Biology (Li et al. 2022). The mutant strains \u0394H4 and \u0394X1 were constructed using the same method as that used to construct \u0394U1. Among them, the two homology arms of the mutant strains \u25b3H4 and \u25b3X1 were obtained from the SIPI-7-14 genome using the primer pairs dnrH-up-F/R and dnrH-down-F/R and dnrX-up-F/R and dnrX-down-F/R, respectively. The constructed plasmids pSET-\u25b3dnrH and pSET-\u25b3dnrX were shown in Additional file: Fig. S2b and Fig. S2c. The final verification PCR primers used were \u0394dnrH F/R and \u0394dnrX F/R. The PCR products of the \u25b3dnrH and \u25b3dnrX genes were validated by further Sanger sequencing.", "To overexpress the drrC gene, the drrC gene fragment was first obtained from the S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 genome by PCR using the primers drrC F/R. The plasmid pSET152 was subsequently digested with NdeI and ligated to the PCR product to construct the integrated plasmid pSET152-drrC (Additional file: Fig. S2d). The correctly sequenced plasmid was introduced into S17-1 competent cells. The drrC gene was subsequently integrated into S. peucetius \u25b3U1 by conjugative transfer. The plasmids pSET152-drrAB (Additional file: Fig. S2e) and pSET152-drrD (Additional file: Fig. S2f) were constructed in the same way. The drrAB and drrD genes were obtained by PCR amplification using the primers drrAB F/R and drrD F/R, respectively. The target gene drrAB was amplified from the S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 genome using the primers drrAB F (TY)/R. The plasmid pSET152-drrC was subsequently digested with speI and ligated to the PCR product to construct the integrated plasmid pSET152-drrABC (Additional file: Fig. S2g). The genetically engineered strains containing the overexpressed genes were cultured in shake flasks, and the yield of doxorubicin was analyzed using HPLC. Genes with accession numbers were as follow: drrA (Accession number: PP049447), drrB (Accession number: PP049448), drrC (Accession number: L76359) and drrD (Accession number: PP049449).", "Optimization of fermentation medium by RSM", "The fermentation medium was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) using the statistical design software Box\u2012Behnken design (BBD), version 8.06.

The seeds were cultured for 40\u201346\u00a0h. The engineered strain \u25b3U1/drrC was selected for fermentation in shake flasks. 10% of the seeds cultured for 40\u201346\u00a0h were transferred to fermentation media for 6 days.

Total RNA was extracted according to the experimental manual provided with the Ultrapure RNA Kit (CWBIO, Beijing, China). Before reverse transcription of the RNA into cDNA, residual DNA in the RNA samples was removed using RNase-free DNase I (Takara, Dalian, China).

The obtained cDNA was used as a template for qPCR, and the transcription level of the drrC gene was determined with the 16S rRNA gene as the reference gene. The primers used for qPCR amplification of the drrC gene and 16S rRNA gene were QdrrC F/R and 16\u00a0S RNA F/R, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S1).
