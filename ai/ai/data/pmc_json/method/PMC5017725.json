["Materials and Methods", "Prodigiosin extract", "Prodigiosin was extracted from Vibrio sp. DSM 14379, its purity and concentration were determined as described previously by Danev\u010di\u010d et al. [15]. The purity of prodigiosin in the extract was checked by HPLC in the wavelength range from 400 to 600 nm. The extract contained more than 98% of \u03b1 and \u03b2 prodigiosin isomers. Prodigiosin concentration in stock solution was 2.93 g L-1 in ethanol.", "Bacterial growth and treatment with different prodigiosin concentrations", "Bacterial strain E. coli MG1655 was grown in liquid LB medium at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm. Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in 20 mL of LB medium and incubated until the culture reached optical density (OD650) between 0.4 and 0.5, E. coli cells were then treated with 10, 60 or 120 mg L-1 of prodigiosin. As a control, an equivalent amount of sterile 96% (V/V) ethanol was added to the culture to the maximal final concentration of 4.44% (V/V).", "To test whether E. coli cells can develop resistance to prodigiosin, cells were treated with 120 mg L-1 of prodigiosin in LB medium at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm for 21.5 h and then diluted 100-fold in 20 mL of fresh LB medium. When cells resumed growth and reached OD650 0.4, they were treated again with 120 mg L-1 of prodigiosin and incubated further at the same growth conditions. This procedure was repeated 3 times. In all consecutive treatments, CFU counts were determined at the time of treatment and 21.5 h afterwards. Then the Malthusian fitness of the strain was calculated as a natural logarithm of the ratio between the final and initial CFU counts [28].", "Cell morphology, viability, and membrane integrity", "E. coli cells were treated with 120 mg L-1 of prodigiosin or 4.44% (V/V) of ethanol (control) in the middle of the exponential phase at OD650 between 0.4 and 0.5. Cell morphology was inspected under the inverted epifluorescence microscope Axio Observer Z1 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) at 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 21.5 hours after addition of prodigiosin or ethanol. The cell length was measured using AxioVision program version 4.8. Additionally, treated E. coli cells were stained with Live/Dead BacLight bacterial viability assay (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions at 0, 1, and 5 hours after prodigiosin or ethanol addition. Fluorescence was observed with Axio Observer Z1 using appropriate filter sets for green fluorescent dye SYTO 9 and red fluorescent dye propidium iodide.", "Modified comet assay", "E. coli cells were grown in liquid LB medium as described above. At OD650 around 0.5 cells were either treated with 120 mg L-1 of prodigiosin, 4.44% (V/V) of ethanol (a negative control) or 100 mg L-1 of ampicillin (a positive control). Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm. For the analysis minigels were prepared and observed as described previously by Danev\u010di\u010d et al. [15].", "Nitrocefin hydrolysis assay", "The outer membrane leakage was determined as nitrocefin hydrolysis according to the modified method by Mensa et al. [29]. Briefly, E. coli cells were grown overnight in liquid LB medium, diluted 100-fold in fresh LB medium and grown at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm up to OD650 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and concentrated 5-fold in phosphate saline buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH value 7.4). Prodigiosin was added to the cells in the final concentration of 120 mg L-1. As a control 4.44% (V/V) ethanol was used. The mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm for either 1 or 5 hours. At the end of the incubation, nitrocefin (10 mg mL-1 in dimethyl sulphoxide, Calbiochem, USA) was added to the mixture to obtain the final concentration 50 \u03bcg mL-1. The kinetics of nitrocefin hydrolysis was measured spectrophotometrically for 10 min at 486 nm and room temperature in 30 s intervals. The rate of nitrocefin hydrolysis was calculated from the slope of the linear part of the kinetic curves. Nitrocefin hydrolysis provides a measure of \u03b2\u2014lactamase activity expressed as the amount of nitrocefin hydrolysed per minute per mg cell protein or U per mg cell protein. To determine the protein content cell extracts were prepared as described by Danev\u010di\u010d and Stopar [30]. Protein content in the cell extracts was determined using Bradford reagent (Sigma, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions.", "Prodigiosin incorporation into bacterial cells", "The ability to incorporate prodigiosin into bacterial cells was studied in viable and autoclaved E. coli MG1655 cells. Bacterial cells were cultured in liquid LB medium as described above. When reaching OD650 between 0.4 and 0.5, cells were harvested with centrifugation and washed with 0.9% (w/V) NaCl. Then, one half of the suspension was autoclaved at 121\u00b0C and 1.3 bar for 15 min, while the rest was incubated further at room temperature. Next, autoclaved cells were washed again. Both cell suspensions were treated with 120 mg L-1 of prodigiosin and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm. After 5 h of incubation cells were harvested and pigment was extracted and quantified as described previously Bori\u0107 et al. [19]. As a control, cells were treated with 4.44% (V/V) of ethanol.", "Induction of the SOS response and DNA cleavage", "E. coli MG1655 cells transformed with pSC101 bearing sulA promoter fused to gfp gene [31] were treated with various prodigiosin concentrations (10, 60 and 120 mg L-1) or 4.44% (V/V) ethanol as a control. After 30 min of incubation at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm, bacterial cells were inspected under the inverted microscope Axio Observer Z1 using filter set for GFP. The control for the SOS response induction was 30 s exposure of bacterial culture to UVC radiation. Chromosomal DNA was extracted from untreated, as well as from prodigiosin and ethanol treated E. coli MG1655 cells, using GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions. Isolated chromosomal DNA from untreated E. coli cells was treated with 60 or 120 mg L-1 of prodigiosin for 30 min and then loaded on 0.8% (w/V) agarose gel to check for DNA degradation. Gel electrophoresis was run at 75 V for 1 h. DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide using UV light.", "CO2 production", "E. coli MG1655 cells were grown in LB medium at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm overnight. Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in 25 mL of fresh LB medium and closed in an air tight 125-mL flask. The amount of CO2 produced was monitored on gas chromatograph HP5890A (Hewlett Packard, USA) in regular time intervals as described before Danev\u010di\u010d and Stopar [30] and Ivan\u010di\u010d et al. [32]. Cells were treated with 120 mg L-1 of prodigiosin or 4.44% (V/V) ethanol as a control after 2.5 h of growth. Respiration activity was expressed as the volume of CO2 produced.", "Protein and total RNA content", "E. coli cells were grown in liquid LB medium as described above and treated with 120 mg L-1 of prodigiosin or 4.44% (V/V) ethanol as a control in the middle of the exponential phase at OD650 between 0.4 and 0.5. Total protein content was measured in bacterial extracts prepared from untreated, ethanol, or prodigiosin treated cells according to Danev\u010di\u010d and Stopar [30]. Protein content in cell extracts was measured using Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions. Total RNA from untreated, ethanol, or prodigiosin treated cells was extracted with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions and quantified with NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific, USA).", "Antibiotic treatment survival with prodigiosin pre-treatment", "Survival of E. coli MG1655 cells after treatment with 100 mg L-1 ampicillin, 100 mg L-1 erythromycin, 100 mg L-1 kanamycin and 5 mg L-1 phleomycin (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was assessed according to D\u04e7rr et al. [33]. Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in 100 mL of fresh LB medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm. After reaching OD650 between 0.4 and 0.5, cultures were treated with 120 mg L-1 of prodigiosin, or 4.44% (V/V) ethanol, or sterile deionized water and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm for additional 2 h. Aliquots of 5 mL were then transferred into separate tubes and antibiotics were added. Sterile deionized water was used as a control. Tubes were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm for 3 h. The number of CFU/mL was determined prior and at the end of the antibiotic treatment. Since there were no statistically significant differences in both control experiments (i.e. addition of equivalent volume of ethanol or sterile deionized water), only results for ethanol pre-treatments are shown.", "Statistical analysis", "All the data presented are averages with standard deviations. Results were statistically evaluated using one-way ANOVA. Samples with p\u2014values equal or lower than 0.05 were taken as statistically significant."]
