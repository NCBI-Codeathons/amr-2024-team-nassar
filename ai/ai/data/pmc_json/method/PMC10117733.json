["Methods", "Sample collection and preparation", "We sampled Yedoma and thermokarst sediments from Central Yakutia from the Yukechi Alas landscape \u223c50\u00a0km southeast of Yakutsk (Table\u00a01A). The Yukechi landscape is characterized by Yedoma uplands and drained as well as extant lake basins, so-called Alases, indicating active permafrost degradation processes (Fedorov and Konstantinov 2003). Field work took place in March 2015 during a joint Russian\u2010German drilling expedition. We used a Russian URB2-47 drilling rig with a steel core barrel without a core catching system. Core barrels had different diameters, starting with 15.7\u00a0cm for the upper core segments and narrowing down to 8\u00a0cm for lower core segments, a setup preventing to get stuck in the deep borehole. To avoid contaminations, coring was conducted as dry drilling and no drilling fluid was used. The retrieved core segments were pushed out from the core barrel with air pressure only. The core segments were visually described and immediately stored in plastic bags or core foil and sealed tightly with duct tape. The wrapped and sealed cores were put into opaque and thermally insulated hard case expanded polypropylene boxes (thermoboxes) and stored outside, where they were kept frozen (or refroze slowly if the sediment material was originally unfrozen) at outside temperature around \u221210\u00b0C to \u221220\u00b0C. During the entire transportation, the core material was kept in the dark and frozen in the thermoboxes. Temperatures below freezing during the entire storage and transport chain were recorded with a temperature data logger in one of these boxes from the drilling site to the laboratories in Potsdam, Germany.", "In total, three long (all \u223c20m\u00a0below surface/lake ice) permafrost sediment and unfrozen thaw bulb (talik) cores were retrieved: one from Yedoma deposits (61.75967\u00b0N, 130.47438\u00b0E), one below a lake on the Yedoma upland (61.76086\u00b0N, 130.47466\u00b0E) and one from the adjacent drained Yukechi alas basin (61.76490\u00b0N, 130.46503\u00b0E) (Table\u00a01A; Fig. S1, Supporting Information). Biogeochemical characterization (Windirsch et\u00a0al. 2020, Ulrich et\u00a0al. 2021) as well as greenhouse gas production (Jongejans et\u00a0al. 2021) is published. In Potsdam, the frozen cores were handled in a freezer laboratory at \u221210\u00b0C. They were split lengthwise using a band saw and were subsequently subsampled. After cleaning the splitting surfaces by scratching with cleaned knifes, the core stratigraphies were described visually and photographed. The sampling core halves were cut into subsamples and divided for further analysis, while the archive core halves were wrapped and sealed again for potential future additional analysis. For the samples used in this study, we took the inner part of the cores only to avoid any other sources of contamination on the outer core margins. After extraction, the subsamples were sent frozen with dry ice to Marseille, France, for further analyses.", "The Stanchikovsky Yar sample (sample B) from which two live viruses were previously isolated (Legendre et\u00a0al. 2014, 2015), and three modern surface soils from pristine cold regions (Kamchatka) were also analyzed for comparison (Table\u00a01B).

Extractions were repeated until \u223c1\u00a0\u03bcg (or more) of raw DNA was obtained for each sample (Table S1, Supporting Information). Samples B, C, D, E were processed using the miniprep kit, following the manufacturer's protocol and by adding dithiothr\u00e9itol (DTT) to the C1 buffer at a 10\u00a0mM final concentration. All other samples (K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R) were processed using the Maxiprep kit, including the addition of DTT to the C1 buffer at a 10\u00a0mM\u00a0final. Samples were ground for 20 s in an MP FastPrep homogenizer (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, California, USA) at a speed of 4\u00a0m/s then incubated for 30 min at 65\u00b0C and finally ground again for 20 s at 4\u00a0m/s. After elution in 5\u00a0ml of elution buffer the extracted raw DNA was concentrated on a silica column from the Monarch Genomic DNA purification Kit from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA). The DNA contents were then quantified using Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) assays (Table S1, Supporting Information) prior sequencing.", "DNA sequencing, assembly and annotation", "Each metagenomic sample was sequenced with DNA-seq paired-end protocol on Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) HiSeq 4000 platform at the French National Sequencing Center \u2018Genoscope\u2019 (https://jacob.cea.fr) producing datasets of 2 \u00d7 150 bp\u00a0read\u00a0length, except for sample B (2 \u00d7 100 bp\u00a0read\u00a0length) (Table S1, Supporting Information). Sequencing libraries were prepared as previously described in Alberti et al. (2017) using an \u2018on beads\u2019 protocol. Briefly, when available, 250\u00a0ng of genomic DNA were sonicated using the E210 Covaris instrument (Woburn, Massachusetts, USA) and the NEBNext DNA Modules Products (New England Biolabs) were used for end-repair, 3\u2032-adenylation and ligation of NextFlex DNA barcodes (Bioo Scientific Corporation, Austin, TX, USA). After two consecutive 1\u00d7 AMPure XP cleanups (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), the ligated product were amplified by 12 cycles of PCR using Kapa Hifi Hotstart NGS library Amplification kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA), followed by 0.6\u00d7 AMPure XP purification. Finally, libraries were quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (MxPro; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and library profiles were evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).", "Reads were quality checked with FASTQC (v0.11.7) (Andrews 2014). Identified contaminants were removed and remaining reads were trimmed on the 3\u2032 end using 30 as quality threshold with BBTools (v38.07) (BBMap 2022). Assemblies of filtered datasets were performed using MEGAHIT (v1.1.3) (Li et\u00a0al. 2015) with the following options: k-list 33,55,77,99,127-min-contig-len 1000. All filtered reads were then mapped to the generated scaffolds using bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) with the \u2013very-sensitive option. The mapping of the contigs was used to calculate the mean coverage of each contig. To ensure a reliable taxonomic assignation, only scaffolds longer than 5 kb\u00a0were considered and submitted to metaGeneMark (v3.38) (Zhu et al. 2010) with the default metagenome-style model. The predicted genes were then compared with the RefSeq database (Li et\u00a0al. 2021) using the Diamond version of blastP (v0.9.31) (Buchfink et al. 2015) with an E-value <\u00a010\u20135, identity percentage threshold of 35 and retaining only the best hits. The taxonomy of each scaffold was then inferred with a custom-made script applying a last common ancestor (LCA) method. At each rank, recursively, the taxonomy was conserved only if over half of the annotated genes presented the same keyword. Unclassified and ambiguous contigs were screened against RefSeq with Diamond blastX (\u2013sensitive option and E-value <\u00a010\u20135), in order to detect exons. Non-overlapping best hits were used. The above taxonomical protocol was applied and only eukaryotic scaffolds were conserved. An alternative taxonomical annotation at the single read level was computed by Kraken (v2) (Wood et al. 2019) using its standard database. This annotation was found to be much less comprehensive and was not used further.", "The diversity and sequencing effort of each sample was estimated by Nonpareil (v3.304) (Rodriguez-R et\u00a0al. 2018) on forward reads over 35\u00a0bp using the k-mer algorithm.", "Contig taxonomy and coverage data were used for beta-diversity estimation together with the k-mer frequency of reads. To do so, 15\u00a0bp k-mer frequency was retrieved for forward and reverse reads by Gerbil (v1.12) (Erbert et al. 2017).

ORFs at least 100 amino acids in length exhibiting a \u03b2-lactamase domain according to Pfam and COG (except for class D solely defined by COG domain) were kept for further analyses. We attempted to identify the \u03b2-lactamase-encoding contigs as potential plasmids using PlasClass (Pellow et al. 2020) and PlasFlow (Krawczyk et al. 2018). However, the results were found to be unreliable and not used further.", "To normalize the \u03b2-lactamase count by a biologically relevant metric, we estimated the number of bacteria in our metagenomic dataset using 120 bacterial single copy genes from the Genome Taxonomy database using GTDB-Tk (Chaumeil et\u00a0al. 2020) as reference (Table S4, Supporting Information).", "For comparison, the abundance of \u03b2-lactamases was also computed in all of the terrestrial metagenomics datasets available from the IMG/M database from June 2021 (Chen et\u00a0al. 2021).
