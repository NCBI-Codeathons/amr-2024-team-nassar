["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Study population and tissue sample collection", "All semen samples were taken during the participants\u2019 abstinence period of 3\u20137 days and were left to liquefy for 30 min. Before collection, the subjects were instructed on the proper procedures to minimize the risk of contamination. The subjects washed their hands with soap two or three times, and the penis, including the glans and coronal sulcus, was cleaned with warm soapy water and then swabbed with 75% alcohol two or three times. Semen was ejaculated directly into a sterile glass receptacle, ensuring no contact with the inner walls to maintain sterility. Freshly collected semen was used for routine clinical tests, Gram staining, and microscopy. The reference for semen analysis is the sixth edition of the WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen. Any remaining semen samples were transferred to sterile freezing tubes and placed in liquid nitrogen for at least 15 min, before being transferred to \u221280\u00b0C freezer for storage until the next sample-processing session.", "Our inclusion criteria were the following: (i) DFI >30% or <15%; (ii) no family history of genetic disease; (iii) no history of genetic disease, systemic disease, known diseases such as varicocele that can affect DFI, or long-term exposure to radiation and toxic substances; (iv) no history of sexually transmitted diseases in the past 3 months; (v) no systemic corticosteroid, prescription antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, systemic corticosteroid use, or cancer chemotherapy in the past 3 months; (vi) no evidence of genitourinary infection.", "Sperm chromatin structure assay", "In accordance with the protocols delineated by the manufacturer, the DNA fragmentation index (DFI) was assessed using acridine orange dye supplied by Zhuhai Anda Biological Engineering Co., LTD. The fluorescence patterns were captured utilizing a flow cytometer, specifically the DxPAthena B4-R2 model from Cytek Biosciences. The calculation of the DFI was then achieved by determining the ratio of red to total fluorescence intensity (the sum of red and green fluorescence intensities) (14, 15).", "Cross-incubation experiment", "Semen specimens were procured from 15 individuals, stratified into three distinct groups: (i) sperm donor group (n = 5); (ii) high DNA fragmentation index (HDFI) group (n = 5); and (iii) low DNA fragmentation index (LDFI) group (n = 5). A segment of each specimen was immediately used to ascertain the DNA fragmentation index (DFI-before).", "For HDFI and LDFI groups, the specimens were centrifuged twice at 1800 rpm for 10 min at 37\u00b0C, and seminal plasma was segregated and stored in discrete tubes. For the sperm group, a refined density gradient centrifugation technique was utilized to segregate spermatozoa from seminal plasma to augment sperm quality. Specifically, gradient liquid was gently introduced to the upper layer of semen, followed by centrifugation at 300 \u00d7 g (1,800 rpm) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The supernatant was subsequently discarded, and the sedimented material was transferred into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Servicebio, China), followed by another centrifugation at 300\u00d7g (1,800 rpm) for 5 min. This procedure was repeated twice to ensure the complete removal of residual gradient liquid, culminating in the resuspension of the sperm pellet in PBS. The treated semen specimens from the sperm group were then divided into three equivalent parts and added to either to the seminal plasma of the HDFI or LDFI group or to an identical volume of PBS.", "Preliminary evaluations of the DNA fragmentation index (DFI-T0) were executed on each semen specimen. Thereafter, the specimens were subjected to a 24-h incubation at 37\u00b0C. The specimens added in PBS were designated as DFI-T24, whereas those in the seminal plasma of the HDFI and LDFI groups were labeled as HDFI-T24 and LDFI-T24, respectively.", "Microbial total DNA extraction and sequencing", "In this study, seven negative controls were meticulously implemented to minimize the risk of contamination, including potential sources: glass receptacle, both unopened and opened freezing tubes, ambient air, tabletop surfaces, and reagents, aligning with recommendations from a previous study (16). Then, total genomic DNA was extracted using MagPure Soil DNA LQ Kit (Magan) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to detect the concentration and purity of microbial DNA, and the extracted DNA was stored at \u221220\u00b0C.", "For the amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, PCR was conducted using barcoded primers specific to the sequence, in conjunction with Takara Ex Taq (Takara), utilizing the previously extracted DNA as a template. The bacterial diversity analysis emphasized the amplification of the V3\u2013V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA genes, employing universal primers 343F (5\u2032-TACGGRAGGCAGCAG-3\u2032) and 798R (5\u2032-AGGGTATCTAATCCT-3\u2032) (17). After secondary purification, the final amplicon was quantified using Qubit dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Sequencing of the constructed libraries was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with 250-bp paired-end reads (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA; OE Biotech Company; Shanghai, China).", "16S rRNA data analysis", "The raw reads underwent a series of pre-processing steps. First, Cutadapt (18) software was used to detect and cut off the adapter. Following trimming, the paired-end reads underwent a series of operations, including filtering low-quality sequences, denoising, merging, and identifying and removing chimera reads. This was achieved through the application of DADA2 (19) with the default parameters of QIIME 2 (2020.11) (20). Subsequently, the software generated representative reads and an abundance table for amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The representative read for each ASV was selected using the QIIME2 package. To enhance taxonomic classification, all representative reads were annotated and subjected to a BLAST search against the Silva database (Version 138) (21) using q2-feature-classifier with default parameters. To enhance the differentiation of genuine low-biomass signals from contamination and noise, efforts should be directed toward enhancing the alignment of experimental and computational pipelines. We utilized the SCRuB (22) software to eliminate contaminating reads identified through negative control samples.", "Community diversity analysis", "The \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity analyses were analyzed using the QIIME2 software. The \u03b1-diversity is assessed using the Shannon index. The unweighted Unifrac distance matrix performed by R package was used for non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to estimate the \u03b2 diversity. Then, the R package was used to analyze the significant differences between different groups using the ANOSIM statistical test.", "Microbial composition difference analysis", "The taxonomy abundance spectrum was compared using the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method. To investigate the potential utility of microbiota in disease diagnosis and prediction, we utilized a machine learning approach, specifically random forest, to construct classification models based on the level of DFI. First, we calculated feature importance scores using the random forest algorithm, specifically the mean decrease accuracy, which indicates the contribution of each feature to the accuracy of the model. Subsequently, we conducted 10 trials of 10-fold cross-validation using random forest to identify optimal biomarkers. The cutoff point for selecting optimal biomarkers was determined based on the mean of the minimum cross-validation error. Random forest analysis was conducted using R software. The optimal biomarker sets were selected based on the cutoff point in the cross-validation error curve, defined as the minimum cross-validation error. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed in R (http://cran.r-project.org/) using the vegan package with normalized OTU abundance and environmental chemical data. Redundancy analysis (RDA) bi-plot shows the correlation between the sequence abundance of microbiota communities and the environmental variables.", "Non-targeted metabolic profiling", "Semen samples were subjected to metabolomics analysis. Non-targeted metabolic profiling procedure was followed as described previously (23). Semen samples were thawed at room temperature and mixed with L-2-chlorophenylalanine as an internal standard. After vortexing, an ice-cold mixture of methanol and acetonitrile was added, followed by ultrasonication and storage at \u221220\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation, dried, and reconstituted with a mixture of methanol and water. After further vortexing and ultrasonication, the samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C and centrifuged, and the supernatants were filtered and transferred to LC vials for storage at \u221280\u00b0C until LC\u2013MS analysis. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared by pooling aliquots of all samples. Metabolomic analysis was conducted using an ACQUITY UPLC I-Class plus (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) coupled with a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. A gradient elution system of water and acetonitrile was used for separation on an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column. The mass range was from m/z 100 to 1,000, with a resolution of 70,000 for full MS scans and 17,500 for HCD MS/MS scans. The mass spectrometer settings included spray voltages, gas flow rates, and temperature control for optimal performance.", "Non-targeted metabolic data analysis", "The matrix was imported into R software (v.4.2.2) for conducting principal component analysis (PCA) to observe the overall distribution among the samples and assess the stability of the entire analysis process. Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were utilized to identify metabolites that exhibit differences between groups. To mitigate overfitting, sevenfold cross-validation and 200 response permutation testing (RPT) were utilized to assess the model\u2019s quality. Variable importance of projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model were used to rank the overall contribution of each variable to group discrimination. Subsequently, a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test was applied to validate the significance of differences in metabolites between groups. Differential metabolites were selected based on VIP values >1.0 and P < 0.05.", "Finally, the distinct metabolites were annotated using the metabolic pathways available in the KEGG database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html) to determine the pathways associated with these metabolites. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using the Python software package scipy.stats (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/), with the most relevant biological pathway related to the level of DFI identified through Fisher\u2019s exact test."]
