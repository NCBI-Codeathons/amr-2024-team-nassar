The synthesized DNA fragment was ligated into pEX18Km or pEX18Tc. The resultant plasmid were transformed into E. coli S17-1. Derivative strains of Pf-5 having a codon-modified pltR in the chromosome were obtained using an allelic exchange strategy described previously (Kidarsa et al., 2011). The nucleotide sequences of codon-modified pltR genes in LK298, LK361, LK362, LK363, LK364, and LK365 were confirmed by sequencing PCR amplicons from each strain, and are shown in Supplemental file 1.", "The gfp gene in plasmid pPROBE'-gfp(tagless) contains five copies of the AGA rare codon (Miller et al., 2000). An 829-bp DNA fragment that contains a modified gfp with all five AGA codons substituted with CGC, a synonymous common codon, was synthesized at IDT. The synthesized DNA fragment also contained a HindIII restriction enzyme site at both ends of the gfp sequence. The plasmid pPROBE'-gfp(tagless) was digested with HindIII to remove the unmodified gfp, and the digested vector was ligated to the synthesized DNA fragment containing the codon-modified gfp, which had also been digested with HindIII. The resultant plasmid pPROBE'-gfp(CGC) was sequenced to confirm the modification of the AGA codons and the orientation of gfp. The promoter of prnA was amplified with primers prnA-f2 and prnA-r1 (Table 1). The PCR product was digested with HindIII and SalI, and the resultant 1361-bp fragment was ligated into pPROBE'-gfp(tagless) and pPROBE'-gfp(CGC) to generate the transcriptional fusions prnA::gfp(AGA) and prnA::gfp(CGC), respectively. The plasmids were sequenced to confirm that both contain the same promoter sequence upstream of gfp.", "Construction of the pltL::gfp transcriptional fusion", "A region of the Pf-5 genome encompassing the putative binding site of PltR and the promoter region of pltL was amplified by the PCR with the primer pair gfp-plt-f3 and gfp-plt-r1 (Table 1).

The 605-bp amplicon was digested with SalI and EcoRI and ligated to pME6010, placing PFL_3991 under the control of a constitutive kanamycin-resistance promoter (Pk) (Heeb et al., 2000), which has been used to overexpress other genes of interest (Manuel et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012).

Each strain was grown in three wells of a 96-well plate, which was incubated in a 96-well plate reader (Tecan Infinite 200Pro, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland) at 27\u00b0C with shaking at approximately 200 r.p.m. Growth of the bacteria was monitored by measuring the OD600. The green fluorescence of bacteria was monitored by measuring emission at 535 nm with an excitation at 485 nm and corrected for background by subtracting fluorescence emitted by the growth medium.", "Antibiotic extraction and quantification", "Pf-5 and derivative strains were cultured overnight in 5 ml NBGly at 27\u00b0C. The cells were washed once with fresh NBGly, suspended in sterile NBGly, and bacterial suspensions were used to inoculate triplicate culture tubes containing 5 ml NBGly to an OD600 of 0.01. Bacteria were cultured for 24 h at 27\u00b0C with shaking (200 r.p.m.). One milliliter of the culture was used to measure the OD600. Four milliliters of the culture were extracted twice with 2.5 ml ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extracts were dried under vacuum and suspended in 100 \u03bcl methanol and a portion (10 \u03bcl) was analyzed by High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC analyses were accomplished using an Agilent 1100 HPLC instrument, which consisted of a quaternary pump, vacuum degasser, autosampler, column thermostat (set to 30\u00b0C), and diode array detector. Separation was achieved using a Luna C18 column (4.6 \u00d7 150 mm, 5 \u03bcm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min where line A was water + 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, and line B was methanol + 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid with the following program. The column was pre-equilibrated in 90% A/10% B and upon injection this composition was held for 2 min. The composition of mobile phase was then changed to 0% A/100% B over 28 min utilizing a linear gradient. This composition was held for 6 min followed by changing to 90% A/10% B over 2 min. The column was equilibrated in 90% A/10% B for 6 min prior to the next injection. Under these chromatographic conditions, pyoluteorin eluted at 15.1 min. The HPLC was operated with and data was viewed using ChemStation (version B.04.03, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Quantification was performed by integrating the area under the curve at 300 nm and comparing to a standard curve prepared by injection of purified pyoluteorin. Data was processed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA)."]
