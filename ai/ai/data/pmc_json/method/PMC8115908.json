["Methods", "We generated ActDES, a database for evolutionary analysis of actinobacterial genomes, in two formats: a database for interrogation by blastn or blastp for phylogenetic analysis, and a primary metabolic gene expansion table, which can be mined at different taxonomic levels (Tables S1 and S2) for specific metabolic functions from primary metabolism. A schematic overview of the generation of the dataset is shown in Fig. 1.", "Fig. 1.Schematic workflow for the creation of ActDES. Genomes were selected from NCBI Taxonomy Browser and uploaded for annotation to rast [38]. The annotated genomes were then processed for two different analyses. Firstly, the functional roles were downloaded and for each functional role the numbers of occurrences per genome were counted in order to obtain an expansion table (Table S2) by comparing the mean of each genus to the overall mean of all genera. Secondly, the genomes were used to extract all nucleotide and protein sequences in fasta format, which could then be queried by sequence using blast [39]. The hits were aligned in muscle [16] and after refinement the alignment was used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees in QuickTree [17].", "Schematic workflow for the creation of ActDES.

The quality of the genome sequences was filtered by the number of contigs (<100 contigs per 2\u2009Mb of genome sequence) and the genomes were downloaded from the NCBI WGS repository (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/). These genomes were then dereplicated to ensure that the database comprised a wide taxonomic range of the phylum, resulting in 612 species from 80 genera within 13 suborders of the \nActinobacteria\n (Table S1).", "Each of these 612 genomes was reannotated using rast. Default settings were used to ensure equivalence of annotation across the database and the annotation files of each genome were downloaded (cvs files \u2013 https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13143407.v1). These annotation files were subsequently used to extract all protein and nucleotide sequences into two files. Each of these files was subsequently converted into blast databases (a protein database and a nucleotide database \u2013 https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12167724) to facilitate phylogenetic analysis. Sequences of interest can be aligned using muscle [16] and phylogenetic trees reconstructed using a range of tree construction software such as QuickTree [17], IQ tree [18] or MrBayes [19]. Subsequent trees may be visualized in software such as FigTree v1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/\ufb01gtree/).", "The rast annotation files were also used to extract the functional roles of each coding sequence (CDS) per genome and the level of gene expansion was assessed for each genome by counting the number of genes per species per functional category (gene function annotation). The dataset was then curated manually for central carbon metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis pathways to create the gene expansion table (Table S2), with the organisms grouped according to their taxonomic position. The quality of the data was checked at each step for duplicates and inconsistencies, and was curated manually to exclude faulty entries. As the NCBI Taxonomy Browser database is overrepresented in \nStreptomyces\n genomes due to the number of species that have been sequenced relative to other \nActinobacteria\n, this is also reflected in ActDES (288 \nStreptomyces\n genomes from a total of 612 genomes). However, this was addressed in the expansion table (Table S2) by calculating the mean occurrence of each functional category within each genus and then calculating an overall mean for the phylum to compensate. The mean occurrence of each functional category per genus plus the standard deviation was also calculated, and this was used to analyse the occurrence of each functional gene category per species within Table S2. A gene function annotation with a gene copy number value above the mean plus the standard deviation for each genus indicated that there had been a gene expansion event in that species and this was noted. The gene expansion table (Table S2) enables researchers to identify groups of genes of interest for subsequent phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis, which can be performed with confidence due to the highly curated nature of the data included in the database.", "As the NCBI Taxonomy Browser database is overrepresented in \nStreptomyces\n genomes due to the number of species that have been sequenced relative to other \nActinobacteria\n, this is also reflected in ActDES (288 \nStreptomyces\n genomes from a total of 612 genomes).
