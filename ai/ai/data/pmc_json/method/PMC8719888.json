One plot was then covered loosely in polythene to protect it from irrigation. The same field sites were sampled again in May at the point of maximum scab impact, once potato tubers had begun to form. In this case, soil samples were taken from the base of the plants, near the root system. For each sampling event, a total of 12 samples were taken from three parallel potato beds at regularly spaced intervals approximately 1 m apart. For the second experiment, 12 irrigated and 12 nonirrigated potato plants were uprooted from field sites in June 2017 and returned to the laboratory in large pots.

The sample was transferred onto the cryostage of an ALTO 2500 cryo-transfer system (Gatan, Oxford, England) attached to an FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Sublimation of surface frost was performed at \u201395\u00b0C for 3 min before sputter coating the sample with platinum for 3 min at 10 mA, at colder than \u2013110\u00b0C. After sputter coating, the sample was moved onto the cryo-stage in the main chamber of the microscope, held at \u2013125\u00b0C. The sample was imaged at 3 kV and digital TIFF files were stored.", "Potato scab biocontrol assays", "In planta assays were performed as described previously (Lin et al., 2018; Sarwar et al., 2018) with some modifications. Briefly, 2 L of GYM (4 g/L glucose, 4 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L malt extract, 2 g/L CaCO3, pH 7.2) was inoculated with a S. scabies 87-22 starter culture from a spore suspension and incubated for 48 hr at 30\u00b0C, 250 rpm. Each culture was then centrifuged at 16,994 \u00d7 g for 15 min and washed twice with PBS (2 L). Pseudomonas strains Ps619, Ps682, and associated mutants were grown overnight at 28\u00b0C, 250 rpm in 50 mL L medium (Luria base broth, Formedium), centrifuged at 1520 \u00d7 g for 15 min, washed twice with PBS (20 mL), and adjusted to OD600 = 0.2 for the final inoculation.", "50 mL of autoclaved vermiculite and 50 mL of bacterial culture were mixed to constitute the final inoculum. 5 L pots were filled with steam-sterilized substrate (John Innes Cereal Mix) and inoculum was applied into the pots and mixed with the soil. Different combinations of bacterial inocula were made accordingly following the same method. Potato seeds cv. Maris Piper obtained from VCS Potatoes Ltd (Suffolk, UK) were surfaced-disinfected by immersion in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 15 min. Tubers were then rinsed with water, air-dried, and placed in pots. Pots were watered until saturation according to their growth stage. Potato plants were grown in a glasshouse with a light cycle of 16 h/8 h at 18\u201320\u00b0C. Two independent experiments were run between 17 July and 6 November 2020 and 31 July and 20 November 2020, and 3\u20134 plants were used per treatment. Tubers were collected, washed, weighed, and scored accordingly to a 1\u20136 scale as described in Andrade et al., 2019. Potato plants were dried for 4 days at 30\u00b0C and aerial parts and tuber weights were both recorded, as well as tuber number. Treatment differences were carried out based on the disease index (DI) of each plant (n = 4 for each treatment). The DI was calculated as the mean of all the scored tubers per plant, and p-values were calculated using Dunnett\u2019s multiple-comparison test."]
