The bsf region (approximate 22.67\u2009kb) was cloned into the corresponding p15A-cm vectors in E. coli, and several constitutive promotors such as PTn5-Km, Papra, or the inducible promoter Ptet were subsequently inserted upstream to bsfC, respectively, leading to the constructions of p15A-cm-Tn5-km-bsf, p15A-cm-Papra-bsf, and p15A-cm-Ptet-km-bsf. Then, the plasmids were electroporated into the heterologous hosts E. coli BL21(DE3) or E. coli GB2005.
