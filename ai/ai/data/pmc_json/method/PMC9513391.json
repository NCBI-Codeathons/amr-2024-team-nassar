The amplified gene was subcloned into expression vector pET28a. For the triple mutant CmnCL136Q,S138G,D249Y, the plasmid was constructed by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method. The primers used for the wild-type and the triple mutant CmnC are shown in Supplementary Table S1. All the plasmids used in this study were verified by DNA sequencing. Each of the wild-type and the mutant constructs was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) for gene expression and protein production.", "Expression, production, and purification of CmnC and its triple mutant", "Both recombinant CmnC and its triple mutant were produced by a general procedure (Chang et al., 2014).
