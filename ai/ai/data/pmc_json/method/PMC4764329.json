["Materials and Methods", "Cave description and sampling", "The Bolshaya Oreshnaya cave (55\u00b0 17\u2032 34.8\u2033 N, 93\u00b0 44\u2032 8.52\u2033 E) is one of the biggest conglomeratic karstic caves in the world [25]. The cave is located in the Mansk area of the Krasnoyarsk region and contains a federally ranked geomorphological natural monument (Siberian Federal Distinct, Siberia, Russia). The Mansk area is one of the most interesting karstic and speleologic areas in the region. This area contains 450 million-year-old Ordovic basal sediment conglomerates that are nearly two-kilometers thick. The Bolshaya Oreshnaya cave is unique due to its age, size and karst cavity structural features. It ranks first in the world in length cavity among karst formations encountered in these rocks. The map of the Bolshaya Oreshnaya cave is available [26]. There are approximately 20 grots connected by an extensive system of tunnels and several lakes up to 15 m deep within the cave. Thus, there are numerous lake wells, balustrades, columns, protected areas with almost transparent stalactites, stalagmites, and draperies in the cave. However, the cave has not yet been fully explored, especially by those in the microbiology and biotechnology fields. Currently, the known depth of the cave is 195 meters, amplitude 247 meters and length of the known passages 47\u201358 km. The age of the cave is approximately 20\u201325 million years, and the annual temperature is very stable and fluctuates approximately 3\u00b0C [25, 27].", "The water from the underground lake and the moonmilk speleothem of split Kolokolniy from Bolshaya Oreshnaya cave were chosen as sources of actinobacteria strains. Water surface and moonmilk samples were collected by sterile syringes and spatulas in sterile tubes, respectively. Several replicates (3\u20135) of each sample were collected in November 2014. Then, the samples were transferred to the laboratory in thermostatic conditions (3\u20135\u00b0C) where they were stirred intensively in 20% sterile glycerol at a ratio of approximately 1:10 and stored at -20\u00b0C.", "Actinobacteria isolation", "The isolation of actinobacteria strains was performed on the solid nutrient media MS (soy flour\u2013 20 g/L; D-mannitol\u2013 20 g/L; agar\u2013 20 g/L; pH 7.2) and agarised DNPM (DNPMA) (soytone\u2013 7.5 g/L; baker yeast\u2013 5 g/L; MOPS\u2013 21 g/L; dextrin\u201440 g/L; agar\u2013 20 g/L; pH 6.8)) supplemented with the antibiotics cycloheximide (50 \u03bcg/mL) and phosphomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL) [28]. At the same time, sample aliquots were preheated for 5 minutes at 50\u00b0C to activate the spores. All samples were diluted in a 1% sterile saline solution at 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 ratios, and the dilutions were plated on the MS and DNPMA media in 3 replicates. Plates were incubated for 30 days at 28\u00b0C and checked every 24 hours for actinobacterial colony appearance. Actinobacteria-like strains were identified based on colony morphology [28]. Colonies were transferred from the primary plates onto new MS media. An attempt was made to obtain pure cultures of all colonies observed on the primary plates. Active and rare strains were deposited in the Russian Collection of Agricultural Microorganisms (RCAM), St. Petersburg. Information about the strain deposition is available at www.arriam.spb.ru.

Amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out with the following primers: 8F (AGA GTT TGA TYM TGG CTC AG) and 1510R (TAC GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T). The obtained fragments were gel purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and sequenced with the amplification primers 8F and 1510R to generate a nearly complete gene sequence (1351~1396 bp). The forward and reverse sequences were assembled with SeqMan DNAStar software (Lasergen, Houston, USA). 39 sequences were multiple-aligned using MAFFT v7.017 (algorithm: auto, gap open penalty: 1.53, offset value: 0.123). The dendrogram was constructed using RAxML 7.2.8 (nucleotide model: GTR GAMMA, algorithm: bootstrapping, bootstrap replicates: 1000), and formatted using Geneious 8.1.7 [29\u201331].

Two different liquid media (NL19 and DNPM) were chosen for metabolite production [28] because the media composition is often a determining factor for the production of different secondary metabolites. The media compositions were as follow: NL-19 (soy flour\u2013 20 g/L; D-mannitol\u2013 20 g/L; pH 7.2) and DNPM (soytone\u2013 7.5 g/L; baker yeast\u2013 5 g/L; MOPS\u2013 21 g/L; dextrin\u201440 g/L; pH 6.8). The strains were cultivated on both types of media at 28\u00b0C at 180 rpm for 4 days. The liquid cultures and biomass were separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Metabolites from the liquid cultures were extracted with ethyl acetate (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) (ratio1:1). The compounds from the biomass were extracted with an acetone:methanol mixture (ratio 1:1) as described in [32].", "Pure actinobacteria cultures grown on solid nutrient media (MS and DNPMA) were homogenized, and metabolites were extracted with an acetone:methanol mixture as described above for biomass compounds. The extracts were evaporated in rotary evaporator IKA RV\u20138 at 40\u00b0C and dissolved in 500 \u03bcL of methanol. For screening of active strain all cultivation and extraction procedures were done three times.", "High performance liquid chromatography separation", "The extract of one active strain (Streptomyces sp. IB2014/78-8, S1 Fig) was cultivated in 1.5 L media of DNPM. The secondary metabolites from the liquid culture were extracted by ethyl acetate as described above. Then, the extract was initially (per minute) separated on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) using a C18 column (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA), and a linear gradient of acetonitrile against 0.1% ammonium formate solution in water was flowed over the column at 5 mL/min for 23 minutes. Thus, 23 fractions of separated extract were prepared. The antimicrobial activities of the fractions were analyzed against those of the bacteria described in the paragraph \u201cBiological activity assay of extracts from isolated strains\u201d.", "Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis", "The active fractions obtained were analyzed by ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry using an LC-QTOF system maXis II (Bruker, Billerica, USA). The samples were separated on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) using a C18 column (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA) and a linear gradient of acetonitrile against 0.1% ammonium formate solution in water at a flow rate 0.5 mL/min for 20 min. The mass detection was performed in both positive and negative modes with the detection range set to 160\u20132500 m/z. Data were collected and analyzed by Brucker Compass Data Analysis software, version 4.1 (Bruker, Billerica, USA). The screening for known compounds was performed using the Dictionary of Natural Products database version 6.1 (CRC Press, Boca Raton, USA) with the following search parameters: accurate molecular mass, absorption spectra and source of compound isolation [33]. Compounds were considered to be similar when the difference in accurate mass was close to 0.01 and the absorption spectra were identical. This part of the study was completed at Helmholtz-Institut f\u00fcr Pharmazeutische Forschung Saarland (HIPS).", "Antibiological activity assay of extracts from isolated strains", "Several types of antibiological activity were investigated. Antibacterial and antifungal activities were estimated for all strains and all type of extracts. The antimicrobial activities of the extracted metabolites were assayed by disk diffusion method [34]. We used this method for qualitative assessment of antimicrobial activities and for primary screening of active strain. For this approach, 40 or 25 \u03bcl of each extract was loaded on 6- or 4-mm diameter paper discs, respectively. Test cultures of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 66337, Pseudomonas putida KT 2440, and Escherichia coli ATCC25922, were plated from the liquid cultures on LB broth dried for 20 minutes prior to disc loading. The antifungal activity of each sample was tested against that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742, Candida albicans DSM1665 and Fusarium verticillioides DSM 62264. The media used for fungus growth was YPD (yeast).", "The test cultures were obtained from the Leibniz-Institut DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). The activity against C. albicans was estimated in Microbial Natural Products at HIPS. The inhibiting influence of extracts on F. verticillioides was estimated in Irkutsk regional veterinary laboratory. The zones of inhibition were measured manually with accuracy \u00b11 mm after overnight cultivation."]
