The fermentation broth was adjusted to pH 3, shaken vigorously with an equal volume of ethyl acetate for 2 hours (37 \u00b0C, 250 rpm), then clarified by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator, the crude extract was dissolved in 600 \u03bcl of methanol, and clarified by centrifugation (12\u2009000 \u00d7 g, 10 min).", "LC-ESI-HRMS analysis of T\u00fc 3010 was performed on LTQ XL Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Thermo Instruments HPLC system, operated in positive ion mode with electrospray ionization. HPLC separation was achieved using a Phenomenex C18 column (4.6 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm) equilibrated with 20 mM ammonium acetate (A) and methanol (B), and was developed with the following program: 0\u20132 min, 90% A; 2\u20134 min, 90% A \u2013 40% A; 4\u201315 min, 40% A \u2013 20% A; 15\u201316 min, 20% A \u2013 10% A; 16\u201320 min, 10% A \u2013 90% A.

It was coupled to a HP1100 HPLC system (Agilent), fitted with a Phenomenex Prodigy C18 column (4.6 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm).

RNA-guided Cas9 cleavage has been developed as the basis for highly precise and convenient genome engineering.59\u201361 In this work an in vitro CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing (ICE) procedure52 was used to specifically reduce the size of the DNA insert on 8G11 to the limits of the annotated stu cluster (stuE-stuF2). Cosmid 8G11 was first treated with Cas9, guided by gRNA-stuF2O-1 and gRNA-stuF2O-2 to generate a linear DNA fragment of interest lacking the right unwanted arm (\u223c10 kbp) of the insert. After end-repair using T4 DNA polymerase, the resulting linear DNA was then cyclised. The cyclised recombinant was again treated with Cas9, guided by gRNA-stuEO-1 and gRNA-stuEO-2, to create the linear DNA fragment now also lacking the left unwanted arm (\u223c5 kbp) of the insert. After end-repair, cyclisation generated pWHU2702, housing the annotated set of stu genes only.", "To study the role of the stuD1 and stuD2 cytochrome P450 genes in T\u00fc 3010 biosynthesis, in-frame deletion recombinants for individual genes in the stu cluster were constructed using the ICE system described above. To construct pWHU2712 (\u0394stuD1) for example, pWHU2702 was treated with Cas9, guided by gRNA-stuD1-1 and gRNA-stuD1-2, and the resulting linear fragment was end-repaired and self-ligated to create pWHU2712. The same procedure was used with guide oligonucleotides gRNA-stuD2-1 and gRNA-stuD2-2 to generate a plasmid-borne stu cluster housing \u0394stuD2. The in-frame deletion recombinant plasmids were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing of the editing joins. The recombinant plasmids were then each introduced into S. avermitilis MA-4680 by conjugation, and the resulting recombinant strains were analysed for the heterologous production of T\u00fc 3010.", "Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis", "Whole genome sequencing for S. olivaceus T\u00fc 3010 and Lentzea sp.

MG11 was commercially performed by Shanghai Southgene Technology Co., Ltd. (SSGT). DNA was analysed and annotated using Artemis Release 13.0.28 The bioinformatics program antiSMASH was used in initial identification and analysis of genetic clusters.3,62 Functional analysis of each gene product was carried out using BlastP30 and multiple protein alignments were compiled by Clustal Omega.63 Predictions for PKS and NRPS domains were made using the University of Maryland PKS/NRPS Analysis Website.64 The structures of molecules were drawn and chemical compound masses calculated using ChemBioDraw Ultra version 14.0 (Perkin-Elmer Informatics).
