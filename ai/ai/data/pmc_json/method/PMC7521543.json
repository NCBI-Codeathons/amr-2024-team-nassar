["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Drug preparations", "JMT is composed of the following 12 kinds of crude drugs: the seeds of Cuscuta chinensis Lam., the seeds of Ligustrum lucidum Ait., the herb of Eclipta prostrata L., the herb of Prunella vulgaris L., the seeds of Litchi chinensis Sonn., Buthus martensii K., the tender stem of Cinnamomum cassia Presl., the rhizoma of Corydalis yanhusuo W. T. Wang, the seeds of Prunus persica L., the seeds of Cassia obtusifolia L, the radix and rhizoma of Asarum heterotropiodes F., and Hirudo nipponica W. at a fixed ratio of 10:10:10:10:30:3:10:10:10:30:3:3. These drug materials were purchased from Beijing Tong Ren Tang Pharm Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) and authenticated according to the Chinese Flora (http://frps.iplant.cn/frps/Uncaria) and Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Edition 2015, Volume I). Voucher specimens (No. jmt15A - jmt15L) were submitted to the Department of TCM, PUMCH, Beijing, China (Supplementary Table 1) [14]. The chemical profile of JMT was determined by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis using the same formulation batch before use in these experiments; a total of 72 compounds were identified [14] (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 2).", "Animals", "All experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u201cGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition\u201d and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committees of PUMCH [certificate no. XHDW-2018-009]. Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) Sprague Dawley rats (6-weeks old, 160-200 g) were purchased from Vital River (Beijing, China). Upon arrival at the vivarium, rats were quarantined and monitored for one week. Rats were socially housed in SPF clean level conditions using standard rat cages and conventional bedding. Rats were given access to food and water ad libitum. All animal rooms were climate controlled (22\u201326\u00b0C, 40\u201370% humidity) with a 12-h light/dark cycle [54]. Diabetes was induced by administering freshly dissolved STZ (55 mg/kg in 0.1 mol/L citrate buffer, pH 4.5, i.p.) following an overnight fast. Hyperglycemia was verified 3 days post-STZ (ACCU-CHEK Active; Roche, Basel, Switzerland); rats with non-fasting blood glucose levels \u2265 16.7 mmol/L were classified as diabetic. Diabetic rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups (distilled water-treated DPN rats, JMT-treated DPN rats, or NTP-treated DPN rats; all n=8); age-matched healthy rats were assigned to the normal control group. Rats received 13.9 g/kg/d of crude drug of JMT, 1.6 NU/kg/d of NTP, or 10 mL/kg/d of distilled water daily. JMT and NTP dosages were determined by adjusting the clinical dosage for human adults by a factor equal to the human to rat body surface area ratio. Animals were monitored daily and maintained for 12 weeks post-STZ.", "Mechanical withdraw threshold", "MWT was assessed 12 weeks post-STZ using the Von Frey Pain Measurement Instrument (cat. no. 2391; IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA, USA). Rats were individually placed in a clear plastic cage containing mesh (1 cm2 perforations). After a 15-min acclimation period, the middle of the plantar of each rat was vertically stimulated with the electronic Von Frey probe, making it appear slightly S-shaped, and the paw withdrawal response was observed. A quick flinching reaction immediately after stimulation was considered a positive reaction, and pressure values (grams) were recorded. A paw withdrawal reaction caused by physical activity was not reported as positive. Test was repeated three times at the interval of 15 min and mean value was finally recorded [55].", "Blood collection and tissue processing", "Blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta and the serum was stored at -80\u00b0C. The bilateral sciatic nerves and plantar skin were cut with sharp scissors and immediately rinsed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) immediately. The sciatic nerve was isolated and cut into two segments: one segment was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4 at 4\u00b0C overnight for ultrastructure observation; the other segment of sciatic nerve and plantar skin were fixed in 4% PFA for pathological and immunohistochemical staining. Rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after tissue processing.", "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)", "Serum NRG1 level was measured and calculated using a commercially available kit (Cloud-Clone, Houston, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Standard or sample, detection reagent, substrate solution and stop solution were sequentially added to wells and incubated with repeated washing as appropriate. Optical density at 450 nm was immediately measured with a plate reader, and sample values were then calculated from the standard curve.", "Electron microscopy and morphometric analysis", "The 4% PFA with 2.5% glutaraldehyde fixed sciatic nerve tissues were sent to the Electron Microscopy Center in the Centralab Institute of Basic Medical Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences for ultrastructure observation. The nerves were rinsed in PBS, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, embedded in epon, and dehydrated with ethanol and acetone. Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and imaged in a transmission electron microscope (TEM-1400, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 8000\u00d7, 20000\u00d7, and 80000\u00d7 magnifications. Morphometric parameters such as number of myelinated axons per 5000 \u03bcm2, percentage of abnormal fibers (fibers with irregular shapes, infoldings, or compacted myelin), and g ratio values (the ratio of inner axon diameter to outer diameter of the myelin sheath, which was used to assess axonal myelination) were analyzed by EM imaging software (RADIUS, EMSIS, M\u00fcnster, Germany) [56].", "Immunohistochemistry", "Sciatic nerve tissues fixed in 4% PFA were embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4 \u03bcm sections. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and imaged using an ultra-compact image capture device (Aperio CS2, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at 400\u00d7 magnification. The remaining sciatic nerve sections were treated as follows: regular dewaxing, antigens repair with hot citric acid buffer (pH 6.0), blocking with 10% goat serum. The sections were then incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C: Caspr, APP, and \u03b2III-tubulin, followed by the appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 40 min at room temperature. Detailed primary and secondary antibody information is shown in Supplementary Table 3. The sections were then washed in PBS and coverslipped in glycerin mounting medium with DAPI. Images were captured using a Nikon A1R confocal system (A1R, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at 400\u00d7 magnification. Quantitative analyses were carried out using Nikon NIS-Element Analyzer.", "Intraepidermal nerve fiber density", "Fixed plantar skin tissues were washed in PBS containing increasing amounts of sucrose. After washing, the samples were snap-frozen in optimum cutting temperature compound and stored at -80\u00b0C. Three longitudinal 50-\u03bcm-thick plantar skin sections were blocked with 3% goat serum containing 0.5% porcine gelatin and 0.5% Triton X-100 in Super-Block blocking buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) at room temperature for 2 h. The sections were then incubated overnight with PGP 9.5 at 4\u00b0C and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Detailed antibody information is shown in Supplementary Table 3. Sections were then coverslipped with glycerin mounting medium. Representative images of intraepidermal nerve fibers were obtained using a Nikon A1R confocal system at 200\u00d7 magnification. Numbers of intraepidermal nerve fiber profiles and epidermis lengths were assessed using Nikon NIS-Element Analyzer. IENFD was calculated as the number of nerve fiber profiles per millimeter of epidermis [57].", "DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing", "Fecal samples were harvested after an overnight fast at week 12 and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C. Genomic DNA was extracted from each fecal sample using the E.Z.N.A.\u00ae Stool DNA Kit (OMEGA, Norcross, GA, USA) combined with bead beating according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing procedure was performed by the Realbio Genomics Institute (Shanghai, China). Extracted genomic DNA was used as the template to amplify the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes. Amplicon libraries were quantified using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, US) and then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, US) with paired-end reads of 250 bp. After discarding singleton reads and removing chimeras, tags were clustered into operational taxonomic units using USEARCH (v7.0.1090) at 97% similarity. A representative sequence of each operational taxonomic unit was then subjected to the taxonomy-based analysis using the RDP database. Heatmap was created using R. Cluster analysis. Alpha diversity and beta diversity were analyzed using QIIME. LEfSe was performed to identify bacterial taxa differentially represented among the groups at different taxonomy levels [58].", "Statistical analysis", "GraphPad software (San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis and graph generation. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation unless otherwise indicated. Normally distributed data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s test for multi-group independent samples. Non-normally distributed data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons test for multi-group independent samples. Statistical significance was defined by p < 0.05."]
