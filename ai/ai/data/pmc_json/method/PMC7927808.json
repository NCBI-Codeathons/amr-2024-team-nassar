["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Strains and growth conditions.", "The Staphylococcus strains used in this study were S. aureus N315, S. aureus USA300 LAC, and S. lugdunensis IVK28. Further strains used for MIC determination were S. aureus N315 with plasmids pRB474, pRB474-lugI, pRB474-lugEF, pRB474-lugIEF, pRB474-lugGH, pRB474-lugIGH, pRB474-lugEFGH, and pRB474-lugIEFGH. The construction of the plasmids is described below. Escherichia coli DC10B was used as the cloning host for further transformation in S. aureus N315 (expression of transporter genes) or S. aureus PS187 for subsequent phage transduction into S. lugdunensis IVK28 (27).", "Basic medium (BM; 1% soy peptone A3 [Organotechnie SAS, France], 0.5% Ohly Kat yeast extract [Deutsche Hefewerke GmbH, Germany], 0.5% NaCl, 0.1% glucose, and 0.1% K2HPO4, pH 7.2) was used as the standard growth medium and for MIC determinations. If necessary, antibiotic was used at a concentration of 10\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 for chloramphenicol. E. coli transformants were grown in lysogeny broth (LB; Lennox) medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl; Carl Roth GmbH, Germany) supplemented with 100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 ampicillin or corresponding LB agar.", "To analyze growth curves, strains were grown overnight in BM with suitable antibiotics under continuous shaking at 37\u00b0C. Each strain was adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1 in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB), and 2.5\u2009\u03bcl of the bacterial stock solutions were pipetted to 500\u2009\u03bcl MHB in a 48-well microtiter plate. The plates were incubated for 48 h under continuous shaking in a microplate reader, and the OD600 was measured every 15 minutes.", "Synthetic lugdunin congeners and control compounds.", "All synthetic lugdunin derivatives were synthesized as described elsewhere (9). Daptomycin (Cubicin) was purchased from MSD Sharp & Dohme GmbH (Haar, Germany); CCCP, gramicidin S, and nigericin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (now Merck, Germany).", "Generation of S. lugdunensis IVK28 knockout mutants.", "DNA manipulation, isolation of plasmid DNA, and transformation of E. coli were performed by use of standard procedures. Enzymes for molecular cloning were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific and New England Biolabs. For the generation of knockout mutants, the temperature-sensitive shuttle vector pBASE6 was used, and mutants were generated by allelic replacement as described previously (28). Flanking regions of the genes to be deleted were amplified by PCR (Table 1) and ligated to shuttle vector pBASE6 after digestion with suitable restriction enzymes. Cloning was performed in E. coli DC10B from where sequence-verified plasmids were transferred to S. aureus PS187 by electroporation. Phage \u03d5187 was used for transduction of S. lugdunensis IVK28 as described elsewhere (27). Mutations in S. lugdunensis were confirmed by PCR amplification of the entire lugJIEFGH region with control primers and analysis of the fragment sizes in comparison to the wild type. For the construction of the lugIGH mutant, the confirmed lugGH mutant was transduced with the plasmid for lugI deletion, and the second deletion was performed in the \u0394lugGH background.", "Primers used for construction of S. lugdunensis IVK28 mutants and their verificationa", "Primer Sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) Assignment.", "lugI K.O._forw1_SacI aaagagctccgttctccacaattctc Deletion of lugI (3\u2032 of lugJ).", "lugI K.O._rev1_NcoI ccctccatggtcattattgataatgataatg Deletion of lugI (5\u2032 of lugJ).", "lugI K.O._forw2_NcoI tgatccatggaaggaggctaataaaaattgatcg Deletion of lugI (5\u2032 of lugE).", "lugI K.O._rev2_BglII aatagatctctcatatatcagacaccaactct Deletion of lugI (3\u2032 of lugE).", "lugJ SacI aaagagctccgtcgttctccacaattc Deletion of lugIEF or lugIEFGH (3\u2032 of lugJ).", "lugJ Acc65I u tatcggtacccattttcaccctccattatc Deletion of lugIEF or lugIEFGH (5\u2032 of lugJ).", "lugG Acc65I d agtggtacccttacattagctgaaagcc Deletion of lugEF or lugIEF (5\u2032 of lugG).", "lugG BglII gctaagtagatctcatataccaaatagcca Deletion of lugEF or lugIEF (3\u2032 of lugG).", "lugJI SacI ccagagctcctaggattaacttgagagg Deletion of lugEF or lugEFGH (3\u2032 of lugJ).", "lugJI Acc65I u cctggtaccccaatacactctccctctga Deletion of lugEF or lugEFGH (3\u2032 of lugI).", "lugF SacI ttagagctccacatattcttgatgatgc Deletion of lugGH (5\u2032 of lugF).", "lugF Acc65I u gataggtacctaacacctttatcagaacc Deletion of lugGH (3\u2032 of lugF).", "lugR Acc65I d acaaggtacctgtagtataaaatccac Deletion of lugGH, lugEFGH, or lugIEFGH (5\u2032 of lugR).", "lugR BglII cttagatcttttcagttatcacaacagg Deletion of lugGH, lugEFGH, or lugIEFGH (3\u2032 of lugR).", "lugJ region down gttttggtacctgtacatggtggtggc 5\u2032 of lugJ (control).", "lugR region up cttagatcttttcagttatcacaacagg 3\u2032 of lugR (control).", "Restriction sites used for cloning are indicated as bold letters.", "Expression of ABC transporter genes in S. aureus N315.", "The transporters of S. lugdunensis IVK28 were cloned in pRB474 as follows. For the lugEF construct, the primers ABC1-down and ABC2-up (Table 2) were used to amplify lugEF, and the primers ABC regulator forw and ABC2-up were used to amplify lugIEF. To express only lugI, the gene was amplified with primers ABC regulator forw and lugI rev (SacI). lugGH was generated with the primers ABC3-down and ABC4-up. For the generation of the lugIGH construct, the plasmid pRB474-lugGH was digested with PstI and treated with alkaline phosphatase. Here, lugI was amplified with the primers ABC regulator forw and lugI rev (Pst), digested with PstI, and ligated into the PstI-digested pRB474-lugGH. The correct orientation of lugI in front of lugGH was confirmed by sequencing. lugEFGH was generated with the primers ABC1-down and ABC4-up. The PCR fragment for lugIEFGH was amplified with the primers ABC regulator forw and ABC4-up.

From this suspension, defined 15-ml agar plates with 8.4\u2009cm diameter were poured. S. lugdunensis strains were grown overnight in BM, centrifuged, and washed in 1/10 volume phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove residual cell-associated lugdunin. After a second centrifugation step, cultures were adjusted to an OD600 of 20, and 10\u2009\u03bcl of the suspensions were spotted on the solidified BM agar plates containing S. aureus. After drying of the spots, the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, and inhibition zones were photographed and analyzed with ImageJ software (version 1.8.0_112).
