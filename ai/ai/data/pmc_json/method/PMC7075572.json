["Methods", "Vector construction", "An in vitro spliced coding sequence of the ATR1 gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of C. nicotianae (GenBank accession number EU530631) using the methodology described previously [46]. The PCR amplification using primers with Gateway adapter sequences introduced the attB1 and attB2 sites at both ends of the 4368-bp spliced ATR1 amplicon (Table 1). Full length 1821-bp cDNA of the CFP gene from C. nicotianae (GenBank accession number EU530632) was amplified using primers with Gateway adapter sequences (Table 1). The intronless 453-bp 71cR gene (GenBank accession number KJ126714) was amplified from the genomic DNA of C. nicotianae with primers carrying the Gateway attB adapter sequences (Table 1). After sequencing each of the genes, Gateway BP clonase was used to insert the genes into the donor vector pDONR221, then Gateway LR clonase was used to move the genes into the destination vector pEarleyGate 100 [47] by using the Gateway cloning system according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Constructs were transformed into E. coli DH5\u03b1 and then mobilized as previously described [48] into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens binary vector strain EHA105 for plant transformation.

To generate CTB1 ihpRNA construct, the same 798-bp region from the ketosynthase domain of the C. nicotianae CTB1 gene (GenBank accession number AY649543) was amplified twice with two different sets of primers. The first PCR product was obtained using the primers LC1F-CTB1 and LC2R-CTB1 (Table 1). The second PCR product was obtained by using the primers LIC3-TT-LIC2 and LIC4-TT-LIC1 [49] with the purified product of the first PCR serving as the template.

In all cases, shoots were rooted on MS medium lacking 6-Benzylaminopurine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) but with bialaphos or kanamycin. Plants were initially screened by PCR to confirm integration of the construct using primers shown in Table 2. Plants were then screened by qPCR to assay gene expression using primers shown in Table 3.

Seed from each plant was screened in vitro for bialaphos resistance by plating seeds on MS medium containing 5mg/l bialaphos and incubating at room temperature for 14 days under a 16 hr light/8 hr dark cycle. Ten bialaphos-resistant seedlings (T1) from each of the five T0 plants were grown in the greenhouse, allowed to self, and T2 seed harvested. The T2 seed from the 10 plants of each of the five lines were screened in vitro for resistance to bialaphos as described above. T1 plants producing seed populations that were not segregating for bialaphos resistance (S2 Fig) were scored as homozygous.

Total RNA was isolated from rooted plantlets using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Isolated RNA was treated with Roche\u2019s RNase-free DNase I, (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to eliminate genomic DNA. Reverse transcription was carried out using 900 ng of total RNA using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. qPCR was carried out using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with a thermal cycling protocol that included an initial denaturation step of 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 seconds, target-dependent annealing temperature for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds with a plate read.

Total RNA was isolated, treated with DNase I, and reverse transcribed as indicated previously. The cDNA was preamplified using SsoAdvanced PreAmp Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) so as to obtain an unbiased amplification of all target amplicons from the limited amounts of fungal nucleic acid transcripts. The primers for this assay comprised of 50nM of primers that included CTB1 and fungal reference genes. The preamplification involved a thermal cycling protocol that included an initial denaturation step of 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes, followed by 11 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and an annealing step of 55\u00b0C for 4 minutes. Each preamplified cDNA was diluted with low EDTA TE buffer (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH) and used as the template for qPCR. qPCR was carried out using iQ SYBR Green Supermix with a thermal cycling protocol that included an initial denaturation step of 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 seconds, 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds with a plate read. Primers for detecting the C. nicotianae CTB1 transcripts (CnCTB1; Table 3) in the silenced lines were designed to anneal outside the target region for silencing so as to ensure that the transcripts quantified would be of fungal origin rather than those of the T-DNA insertion in the plant containing the silencing region. Normalization was carried out using the fungal actin and tubulin genes, which had the same amplification efficiency as the CTB1 gene. Statistical significance of normalized fungal transcripts was determined by one-way ANOVA along with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test using \u2018Hicks\u2019 as control group. Fold-changes in gene expression was calculated by comparing the fungal transcripts in all transgenic lines including the vector control to that of the wild type \u2018Hicks\u2019 by using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method.", "Disease analysis", "Transgenic lines including the vector control and wild type cv \u2018Hicks\u2019 were grown in the greenhouse in six inch pots for 12 weeks. Conidia were produced from mycelium of C. nicotianae isolate ATCC 18366 that was grown on potato dextrose agar for one week, and then homogenized with glass beads, and plated on clarified V8 agar (300 ml of V8 juice supplemented with 4.5g of calcium carbonate, centrifuged for 10 min, the supernatant brought to 1L with water, supplemented with 2% agar) for 7 days at 18\u00b0C in the dark. Aerial mycelium was removed by brushing the growth with sterile distilled water so as to expose the stroma. Plates were incubated for an additional week at 18\u00b0C in the dark. Conidia were harvested with sterile distilled water supplemented with 0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), and the concentration adjusted to 5 x 104/ml. Spores were atomized onto the abaxial and adaxial sides of tobacco leaves. The entire plant was covered with bags for 4 days to allow symptom development under conditions of high humidity. In each experiment, each transgenic line along with the vector control and wild type cv \u2018Hicks\u2019 was represented by five biological replicates, and the entire study was repeated once again. Symptoms were monitored weekly for up to six weeks post inoculation. Disease severity of each line was assessed as previously described [13] as the proportion of the mean number of coalesced lesions on five leaves of each of five plants per line compared to wild type cv \u2018Hicks\u2019. To test the role of the transgene in conferring resistance to C. nicotianae, the disease severity in transgenic lines were compared to the wild type control and the data were statistically analyzed using the Satterthwaite-Smith-Welch test [41, 42]."]
