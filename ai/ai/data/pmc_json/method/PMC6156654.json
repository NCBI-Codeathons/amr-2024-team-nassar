All donors provided written informed consent.", "NGS Sequencing.", "The selected MDE droplets were freeze dried and total DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA Investigator Kit (Qiagen). Whole-genome amplification was performed using the REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (Qiagen). For individual strains, genomic DNA (100 ng for each sample) was disrupted into 400- to 550-bp fragments using the Covaris S220 System (Covaris). Sequencing of libraries was performed using the genetic analyzer HiSeq2500, the HiSeq PE Cluster Kit v4 cBot and the HiSeq SBS Kit v4 (250 cycles) (Illumina) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For detailed information please refer to SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.", "Deep Profiling of Ami Activity.", "Different microbiota samples were serially coencapsulated with Ami to the final concentrations of 0, 10, and 100 \u00b5g/mL Ami inside MDE droplets. Calcein Violet AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the droplet emulsion to the final concentration of 10 \u03bcM for metabolic activity staining after 10 h of incubation at 35 \u00b0C. Following the incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the droplets with Calcein Violethigh fluorescence (450/50-nm filter) were sorted using a FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The collected droplets were frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze dried, and analyzed by whole-genome sequencing, and bioinformatics resulted in quantification of bacteria in samples (Fig. 5B). Bacteria distributions in samples with Ami were normalized to the respective distribution in samples without Ami, resulting in shift fold calculated for each bacterium in the sample (Fig. 5A). The natural logarithm of the shift fold was defined as a score. Bacteria that have negative scores (depleted) at 10 \u00b5g/mL Ami concentration were defined as susceptible (MIC < 10 \u00b5g/mL), positive scores (increased) at 100 \u00b5g/mL as resistant (MIC > 100 \u00b5g/mL), and positive scores at 10 \u00b5g/mL and negative scores at 100 \u00b5g/mL as intermediate (MIC = 10\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), respectively. Confidential intervals of MICs were predicted using a linear regression between the scores and the mean values of MIC measured in vitro for particular bacterial strains using bacterial collection."]
