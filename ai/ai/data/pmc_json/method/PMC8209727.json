["Methods", "Bacterial strains used in the study", "The \nE. coli\n strains were collected in Japan from 418 healthy bovines in 2013 and 2014, 278 healthy humans in 2008, 2009 and 2015, and 89 humans with extra-intestinal infections, either bacteraemia (n=67) in 2002\u20132008 or urinary tract infection (n=22) in 2006 and 2011. They were described recently [25] and corresponded each to a single isolate; duplicates showing less than five SNPs difference in their whole genomes were excluded from this study. A list of the 109 pks-positive isolates is provided in Table S1 (available in the online version of this article). An additional set of 37 \nE. coli\n reference strains (Table S2) and seven non-\nE. coli\n strains (Table S3) were included in this study; their genome sequences were downloaded from NCBI, except for \nE. coli\n SP15 which was not available and was obtained here (see below).", "Whole genome sequencing", "The whole genome sequences of the 785 \nE. coli\n isolates were determined by Illumina sequencing [25]. Among these, the genomes of five \nE. coli\n strains (ECSC054, JML285, KS-NP019, NS-NP030 and SI-NP020) were further subjected here to long-read sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION device. The DNA libraries were prepared using the rapid barcoding kit (ONT) and sequenced using MinION R9.4.1 flow cells. Long-read sequencing of \nE. coli\n strain UPEC129 was also performed using a Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RSII sequencer (Genoscreen). The DNA was extracted using Gentra Puregen Yeast/Bact (Qiagen) and the DNA libraries were prepared using the SMRTbell Template Prep kit (PacBio). Hybrid assembly of Illumina paired-end reads and MinION or PacBio reads was performed using Unicycler (v.0.4.8) [26]. The whole genome sequence of \nE. coli\n reference strain SP15 was obtained using Illumina and ONT MinION instruments and assembled as described above.", "Sequence and phylogenetic analysis", "The core gene-based phylogenetic tree was reconstructed as described previously [25]. Briefly, core genes were determined using Roary [27] and SNP sites were extracted from the core gene alignment using SNP-sites [28]. The maximum-likelihood (ML) tree was reconstructed using RAxML [29] with the GTR-GAMMA model and displayed using iTOL [30].", "For the phylogenetic analysis of the entire pks island, the genome sequences of pks-positive strains were aligned with the entire pks island sequence of strain IHE3034 using MUMmer [31] and the SNP sites located therein were identified. After removing SNP sites on the VNTR region, a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree was reconstructed by mega7 [32] using the Tamura\u2013Nei evolutionary model.", "Co-phylogenetic analysis of the core-gene-based ML tree and the pks-based NJ tree was performed using the \u2018cophylo\u2019 function of the R package Phytools [33].", "Sequence type and phylogroup determination was performed as described previously [25].", "The pks sequences from four \nE. coli\n strains belonging to distinct phylogroups (i.e. SI-NP020, KS-NP019, UPEC129 and ECSC054 from phylogroups A, B1, B2 and D, respectively) were extracted from hybrid assemblies and compared at the nucleotide level with that of the reference \nE. coli\n strain IHE3034. In addition, the amino acid sequences were obtained for the 19 clb genes of each strain and aligned by muscle with mega7 [32]. The alignment file was analysed with the sequence identity and similarity online software (http://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/sias.html; accessed in July 2020).", "The comparison of pks sequences from \nE. coli\n and other bacterial species was performed with blastn (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch). Each pks region was defined from clbA to clbS and used as the query nucleotide sequence against each pks region as the subject. Then, the alignment was visualized with the Artemis Comparison Tool (v13.0.0) [34].", "The integrase nucleotide and amino acid sequences were aligned using muscle (v3.8.31) and the phylogeny was analysed with PhyML (v3.1/3.0 aLRT) prior to tree visualization with TreeDyn (v198.3) (http://www.phylogeny.fr; accessed in September 2020).", "The CC95 strains were typed for their fimH allele using FimTyper (v1.0) (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/FimTyper/; accessed in November 2020) and were further assigned to subgroups A\u2013E by analysis of the presence of either of the five subgroup-specific genes described previously [35].", "PCR analysis of the clbJK fusion gene", "The 5651\u2009bp deletion in the clbJ-clbK region resulting in the clbJK fusion gene was tested using a duplex PCR assay, with two primer pairs. The first primer pair (clbK-F, 5\u2032-GACTGCCCAACATACGCTCCG-3\u2032; clbK-R, 5\u2032-TTGTGTCGTTGTACTCTCGGC-3\u2032) was used to amplify a 722 bp long DNA fragment that is located within the deleted region and is thus only present in strains with an intact clbJ-clbK region. The second primer pair consisted of primers clbJK-F (5\u2032-AGAATTACCCACTGCCACCA-3\u2032) and clbJK-R (5\u2032-GGCGCTAATGGATCAGATGT-3\u2032) flanking the deleted region, and was used to amplify a 1441 bp long DNA fragment only present in strains with a clbJK fusion gene. The strains with an intact clbJ-clbK region or a clbJK fusion gene yielded a 722 or a 1441\u2009bp long amplification product, respectively. The final reaction mixture volume of 50\u2009\u00b5l contained 2\u2009\u00b5l template DNA, 1\u00d7 GoTaq Reaction buffer, 200\u2009\u00b5M of each dNTP, 4\u2009mM of MgCl2, 1.25 U of GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 0.2\u2009\u00b5M of each primer (Eurofins Genomics). Amplification was done in a GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems), with the following programme: initial denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, annealing at 56\u2009\u00b0C for 45\u2009s and extension at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min 30\u2009s; and final extension at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. Electrophoresis was carried out in 1\u200a% agarose gel and the PCR products were visualized after Gel Red (Biotium) staining using a Bio-Rad Chemidoc XRS system (Bio-Rad).", "In vitro DNA interstrand crosslinking assay", "ICL activity was assessed as described previously [15]. Briefly, 3\u00d7106\n\nE. coli\n cells or 6\u00d7106\n\nErwinia oleae\n cells pre-grown for 3.5\u2009h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 25\u2009mM HEPES (Invitrogen) were mixed with EDTA (1\u2009mM) and 400\u2009ng of linearized plasmid pUC19 DNA and the mixtures were incubated for 40\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After pelleting the bacteria, the DNA was purified from the supernatant and analysed by electrophoresis on denaturing (40\u2009mM NaOH \u2013 1\u2009mM EDTA) 1\u200a% agarose gels. ICL activity of \nErwinia oleae\n was also tested in the presence of 400\u2009nM 6-histidine-ClbS, which was purified with HisPur nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Thermo Scientific) from a culture of BL21(DE3) strain hosting the plasmid pET28a-ClbS-His, as described previously [15].", "Megalocytosis assay", "Non-haemolytic pks-positive strains were tested for megalocytosis on infected HeLa cells as described previously [5, 36]. Briefly, HeLa cells grown to 50\u200a% confluence in cell culture 96-well plates were inoculated with 5\u2009\u00b5l of an overnight culture of bacteria in infection medium (DMEM with 25\u2009mM HEPES) and incubated for 4\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a 5\u200a% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then washed and incubated for 48\u201372\u2009h in cell culture medium supplemented with gentamicin at 200\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u22121, and then stained with methylene blue for microscopy examination.", "H2AX phosphorylation assay", "HeLa cells were infected as described above and H2AX phosphorylation was quantified immediately after the 4\u2009h infection step by immunofluorescence as described elsewhere [37].", "C14-asn quantification", "E. coli\n strains were grown for 24\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 10\u2009ml DMEM-HEPES (Gibco), resuspended in 500\u2009\u00b5l Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen) and then crushed with a Precellys instrument (Ozyme). After addition of an internal standard mixture (deuterium-labelled compounds; 400\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121), cold methanol (MeOH) was added and samples were solid-phase extracted on HLB plates (OASIS HLB 2\u2009mg, 96-well plate; Waters). Lipids were eluted with MeOH, evaporated under N2, resuspended in MeOH and analysed by HPLC/MS-MS analysis (LC-MS/MS) (MetaToulLipidomics Facility), as described previously [21]."]
