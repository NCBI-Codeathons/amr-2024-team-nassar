["Materials and Methods", "Handling and growth of N. crassa strains", "Table 1 lists the strains used in this study. Unless otherwise stated, all handling and growth of N. crassa strains was conducted as previously described (Davis and De Serres 1970). Briefly, conidia for growing liquid cultures were produced by inoculating conidia in the center of 250 ml or 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 or 25 ml, respectively, of Vogel\u2019s salts, 1.5% sucrose, trace elements, and biotin (VSuTB). Medium was solidified with 1.5% agar. Any additional supplements were added as required. The most commonly used supplement was pantothenic acid at a final concentration of 10 mg/liter. Flasks were incubated for two to three days at 30\u00b0 and then placed at room temperature to allow conidiation to occur in a well-lit room for four to five days. Conidia were used up to 10 days after their formation. Stocks were maintained on agar slants containing VSuTB, plus any required supplements, and kept frozen at \u221280\u00b0.", "Strains used in this study", "Strain Origin Genotype Uninduced aod-1 mRNA level.", "NCN233 Nargang lab pan-1, A low.", "T1P11 S.

Conidia were counted using a hemocytometer, and added to VSuTB liquid medium at a concentration of 106 conidia/ml, followed by shaking at 30\u00b0 for 12 to 18 hr, or as indicated. When required, Cm (at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml) was added to media as an inducer of aod-1 transcription and production of the AOD1 protein.", "Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)", "To isolate RNA, conidia were grown in liquid cultures for 12-14 hr in medium lacking Cm (-Cm) or 16-18 hr in medium containing Cm (+Cm). Mycelial pads were obtained via vacuum filtration. A portion of the pad weighing approximately 100 mg fresh weight was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All equipment (glassware, Buchner funnels, forceps, mortars, pestles, and aluminum foil) was baked at 240\u00b0 for at least 24 hr to eliminate RNase contamination. RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Kit following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for fungi (Qiagen Inc, Hilden, Germany). RNA concentrations were measured using a Nanodrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford) and RNA integrity was analyzed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 Nano chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara). Only samples with RNA integrity numbers greater than 9.6 were used. cDNA was synthesized using 1 \u03bcg of RNA per reaction with Superscript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad) and was diluted 20-fold with DNAse-free distilled H2O for use in qPCR. qPCR was performed using the StepOnePlus RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). The reactions contained 2.5 \u03bcl of the 20-fold diluted cDNA, 2.5 \u03bcL diluted primer and 5 \u03bcl KAPA SYBR Fast qPCR master mix (KAPA Biosystems, USA) for a total volume of 10 \u03bcL per well on a 96-well plate. \u03b2-tubulin was used as an endogenous control for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis. Unless stated otherwise, all qPCR data are based on four biological replicates, each with three technical replicates. Statistical comparison between samples was done using the Students t-test in Microsoft Excel.", "Isolation of mitochondria", "Cultures were grown in 250 ml of liquid VSuTB (with any needed supplements) for 16 hr without Cm or 18 hr in the presence of Cm (unless stated otherwise). Cultures were vacuum filtered to obtain mycelium pads. Pads were kept on ice until they could be processed. Mycelia were broken by grinding with sand and mitochondria were isolated using the buffers and differential centrifugation procedure described previously (Nargang and Rapaport 2007).", "Electrophoresis of proteins and western blots", "Acrylamide gels for sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were prepared as described by Sambrook and Russell (Sambrook and Russell 2001). The final acrylamide concentration was 12.5% with an acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio of 29:1. 30 \u03bcg of mitochondrial protein was loaded in one lane of a gel. Following electrophoresis proteins were transferred onto a Bio Rad Immun-Blot PVDF membrane (Bio Rad, Berkeley) as described (Towbin et al. 1979). Following transfer, the membrane was blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in blocking solution (5% fat-free skim milk powder in TBST (0.2 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20)) with gentle shaking. The blocking solution was removed and the membrane was incubated with gentle shaking for 1 hr with primary antibody at an appropriate dilution in blocking solution. The membrane was then washed three times, with gentle shaking for 5 min with TBST, followed by a 1 hr incubation with gentle shaking at room temperature with secondary antibody (1:3000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit antibody HRP-conjugate solution) in 50 ml blocking solution. The membrane was then washed three times for 10 min with TBST, and once with TBS (TBST without Tween 20). Detection of bound antibodies was facilitated using the LumiGLO chemiluminescent detection assay (KPL, Maryland) with Kodak XAR film (Eastman Kodak, New York).", "Generation of PCR products and isolation of DNA from gels", "All PCR products were amplified using Phusion High Fidelity PCR (New England Biolabs, Ipswich). Primers were obtained from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville). Following PCR reactions, DNA was size-separated via gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. Bands of interest were excised with a scalpel on a UV transilluminator, and DNA was extracted using a QiaQuick Gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.", "Genomic DNA isolation", "N. crassa genomic DNA was isolated using modifications of a previously described procedure (Wendland et al. 1996). Liquid cultures were grown in VSuTB at 30\u00b0 for approximately 24 to 48 hr. Mycelial pads were obtained by vacuum filtration, and were stored on ice prior to processing. Approximately 2 g of mycelium was used per preparation. Mycelium was ground using a mortar and pestle on ice with 1.5 g sand and 5 ml New Isolation Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). The mixture was transferred to a tube for the Sorvall SA-600 rotor (Sorvall, Mandel Scientific, Guelph) for later use in centrifugation. The mixture was then brought to 10 ml with New Isolation buffer, and covered with parafilm. The tubes were shaken vigorously, inverted slowly for approximately 1 min, then incubated in a 70\u00b0 water bath for 1 hr. Tubes were then placed on ice for 10 min, after which 0.64 ml of 8 M potassium acetate pH 6.0, was added to each tube. The samples were left on ice for 1 hr. Tubes were placed in a Sorvall RC-5C Plus centrifuge with an SA-600 rotor (Sorvall, Mandel Scientific, Guelph) and centrifuged at 14 000 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean SA-600 tube. An equal volume of isopropanol was added to the sample and mixed gently. The DNA precipitate was spooled around a sterile glass Pasteur pipette, transferred to a sterile disposable 15 ml tube, rinsed with 70% ethanol, and allowed to air dry. The pellet was then suspended in 400 \u03bcl 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. 200 \u03bcl HiSalt Buffer (100 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-base pH 7.4, 2 mM Na2EDTA) and 15 \u03bcl of previously boiled RNAse A solution (10 mg/ml) was added. The dissolved pellet was incubated at 37\u00b0 for 30 min. An equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1) was then added. The tubes were shaken vigorously for 1 min and centrifuged for 1 min at maximum speed in a Sorvall Biofuge pico centrifuge (Sorvall, Mandel Scientific, Guelph). The top layer was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and the phenol/chloroform extraction procedure was repeated once more. To precipitate final genomic DNA, one tenth volume of 3M sodium acetate, as well as three volumes of 95% ethanol were added to the Eppendorf tube and mixed. The tube was centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min. The pellet was washed once more with 70% ethanol, centrifuged at maximum speed for 1 min, and the remaining ethanol was removed. The pellet was left to air dry for 1 hr at room temperature and was then resuspended in sterile distilled H2O.", "Sequencing of DNA fragments", "DNA sequencing reactions were set up according to the specifications of the MBSU (Molecular Biology Services Unit) at the University of Alberta. DNA sequencing was conducted by the MBSU using a 3730 Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). FinchTV (Geospiza Inc., Seattle) and NCBI BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) were used for sequence alignment and analysis.", "Whole Genome DNA Sequencing", "Genomic DNAs from four strains (Table 1) expressing high uninduced levels of aod-1 transcript (strains T1P11, 19, 23 and 26) and four expressing low levels of uninduced aod-1 transcript (strains NCN233, 3, 4 and 6) were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego) with a read length of 101 nucleotides. The sequences were mapped with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) (Li and Durbin 2009) to the wild type OR74A sequence (assembly 10) available at the FungiDB database (http://fungidb.org/fungidb/). The assembly 10 sequence is hereafter referred to as the reference sequence.", "Analysis of Whole Genome Sequencing", "The genomic sequence data were mounted in g-browse (http://ascobase.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/ncrassa_public/) (Stein et al. 2002) to allow viewing of each strain\u2019s sequence relative to the reference sequence and to each other. Variants were called with the GATK HaplotypeCaller tool followed by the Joint Genotyper (GenotypeGVCFs) (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) to generate a vcf (variant call format) file. This file was opened in the IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) (Robinson et al. 2011; Thorvaldsdottir et al. 2013) which also allows viewing of each strain\u2019s sequence relative to each other and the reference sequence. The vcf file was also exported to Microsoft Excel using the delimited column data format with \u201ctab\u201d and \u201cspace\u201d as the delimiters. This resulted in an Excel table where changes present in each strain, relative to the reference sequence, were in separate columns. Other columns listed the supercontig, and numbered the position of each change (according to the reference sequence) and the actual sequence change. The sites of mutations occurring in any strain were listed in columns corresponding to each strain. In these columns, each cell contained a binary system where, at a specific position in the genome, a \u201c0\u201d indicated a match to the reference sequence in a given strain while a \u201c1\u201d indicated a change relative to the reference sequence for that strain.", "In the Excel sheet, conditional formatting criteria was applied to columns corresponding to each strain to allow for filtering of the data. Conditional formatting involved the creation of a \u201cNew Rule\u201d in the \u201cClassic\u201d style from the drop-down menu. Columns for all strains were formatted so that cells that began with \u201c1\u201d were designated a color, for example, pink. Cells that began with \u201c0\u201d, indicating positions that match the reference sequence, were kept white. This allowed a choice between seeing positions that matched the reference sequence (white) or positions that were different from the reference sequence (pink). Columns corresponding to the low aod-1 expression strains (NCN233, 3, 4, and 6) were first filtered for white, indicating no change from the reference sequence at a certain position. Following this, high-expressing aod-1 transcript strains (T1P11, 19, 23, 26) were analyzed on an individual basis. Each column corresponding to a high-expressing aod-1 transcript strain was filtered for the color pink so as to select only variants. Variants fit the criteria of beginning with \u201c1\u201d and were designated a color. The positions of the variants were copied, and then pasted into another spreadsheet with a VBA (Visual Basics for Application) FindData code (explained below). Before moving onto a different high-expressing aod-1 transcript strain, the variant color filter for the previous high-expressing strain was cleared. This was done so as to not select for variants that are present in different high expressing strains, allowing a full list of variants to be generated independently of other variants in other high-expressing strains. A filter for low-expressing strains remained at \u201cwhite\u201d for the entire filtering analysis in Excel to ensure that no changes present in high-expressing strains would also be present in low-expressing strains.", "To analyze the positions of variants in each strain, a VBA code, which we named \u201cFindData\u201d, was written in a different Excel spreadsheet (Figure S1) and took the position of the change in question and searched through the list of known coding regions in the N. crassa genome in the supercontigs transcript annotation file (assembly 10) from the BROAD Institute. The filtering process described above resulted in a list of positions with changes in only high-expressing strains throughout the genome, including non-coding regions, coding regions, and UTRs. If the position was in the coding region of a protein coding gene, the program would list the NCU number of the gene. One chromosome was examined at a time to meet Excel\u2019s RAM restrictions. A list of NCU numbers with changes in coding regions was generated for each strain expressing high levels of uninduced aod-1 transcript (T1P11, 19, 23, and 26). The list of NCU numbers was then analyzed in the Venny web based software (Oliveros 2007-2015) to generate a Venn diagram, which enabled identification of genes that were mutated in all four high expressing strains.", "Analysis of protein sequences", "Protein sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega (Goujon et al. 2010; Sievers et al. 2011).
