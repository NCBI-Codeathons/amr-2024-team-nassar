["2. Materials and methods", "2.1. Bacterial culture and metabolites extraction", "The acquisition of extracts for LC\u2013MS/MS analysis was achieved by using a 24-well microbioreactor system (Applikon Biotechnology Inc., Nederland). For that, a colony of the bacterial strain was inoculated in 1.5\u2009mL of four broth media including M2 (Mannitol 40.0\u2009g/l, Maltose 40.0\u2009g/l, Yeast extract 10.0\u2009g/l, K2HPO4 2.0\u2009g/l, MgSO4\u00b77H2O 0.5\u2009g/l and FeSO4\u00b77H2O 0.01\u2009g/l), IMA (Yeast extract 4\u2009g/l, Malt extract 10\u2009g/l, Glucose 4\u2009g/l, Mannitol 40\u2009g/l), YES (Sucrose 150\u2009g/l, Yeast extract 20\u2009g/l, MgSO4\u00b77H2O 0.5\u2009g/l, ZnSO4\u00b77H2O 0.01\u2009g/l and CuSO4\u00b75H2O 0.005\u2009g/l) and CGA (Glycerol 30\u2009g/l, Peptone 2\u2009g/l, K2HPO4 1\u2009g/l, NaCl 1\u2009g/l, MgSO4\u00b77H2O 0.5\u2009g/l and 5\u2009mL of trace solution containing CaCl2\u00b72H2O 3\u2009g/l, MnSO4 0.2\u2009g/l, ZnCl2 0.1\u2009g/l, CuSO4\u00b75H2O 0.025\u2009g/l, Na2B4O7\u00b710H2O 0.02\u2009g/l, CoCl2 0.004\u2009g/l and (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O 0.01\u2009g/l). Extraction of secondary metabolites was performed using ethyl acetate after 7\u2009days of incubation at 15\u00b0C and 190\u2009rpm. We also obtained extracts from un-inoculated wells for each media to be used as blank controls. For this study, a single well for treatments and blanks was extracted. Then, to acquire the necessary number of extracts for antifungal assays, we performed a scaled-up cultivation process. Basically, after three days of incubation in TSA medium (16\u00b0C), the bacterial strain inoculum was set in 0.85% sodium chloride solution to 1\u00d7107 CFU (McFarland standard), and 150\u2009\u03bcL were inoculated to Erlenmeyer\u2019s with 150\u2009mL of the same culture media described previously and incubated in the same conditions. Liquid\u2013liquid extraction was performed with ethyl acetate, and the resulting extracts were dried on a rotary evaporator and kept under refrigeration until use on bioassays.", "2.2. Detection of secondary metabolites by LC-QTOF-MS/MS under different culture media", "An in-situ extraction of each culture was done by adding 2\u2009mL of ethyl acetate to each well of the previously grown cultures on the microbioreactor system. After incubation for 60\u2009min at 190\u2009rpm at room temperature, the organic phase containing secondary metabolites was collected, dried under N2 airflow, and resuspended in 20\u2009\u03bcL of methanol to generate the analytes for LC-QTOF-MS/MS and to conduct antimicrobial assays. Aliquots of each extract (1\u2009\u03bcL) were analyzed by LC-QTOF-MS/MS, in a Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC coupled to an Agilent 6545 LC/QTOF mass spectrometer with an orthogonal electrospray ionization (ESI) interface (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany); using a Zorbax C8 RRHD 1.8\u2009\u03bcm (2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009mm) column, elution gradient of 2.50\u2009min at 0.417\u2009mL/min from isocratic 90% H2O/MeCN (acetonitrile) to 100% MeCN (with isocratic 0.1% formic acid modifier). MS/MS analysis was performed on the same instrument for ions detected in the full scan at an intensity above 1,000 counts at 10 scans/s, with an isolation width of \u223c4\u2009m/z using a fixed collision energy of 20\u2009eV and a maximum of three selected precursors per cycle. Samples were injected (5\u2009\u03bcL) using an autosampler refrigerated at 4\u00b0C.", "2.3. Mass spectrometry data processing and analysis", "Data were converted from raw to mzXML format with MSConvert (Chambers et al., 2012) and uploaded to the GNPS platform (Wang et al., 2016) for further analysis. A molecular network was created with filtered data (MS2 fragment ions within \u00b117\u2009Da of the precursor m/z were removed). To window filter MS2 spectra, only the top 6 fragment ions in the \u00b150\u2009Da window throughout the range were chosen. The precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 0.02\u2009Da, and an MS2 fragment ion tolerance of 0.02\u2009Da. The network was created by filtering edges to a cosine score above 0.7 and more than six matched peaks, and boundaries between two nodes were kept in the network if and only if each of the nodes appeared in each other\u2019s respective top 10 most similar nodes. The spectra in the network were searched against GNPS\u2019 spectral libraries. The library spectra were filtered in the same manner as the input data. All matches kept between network spectra and library spectra were required to have a score above 0.7 and at least six matched peaks. The network can be accessed by the link: https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=879d66d4fb9c44cc83d9fb4031646223. Results were visualized on Cytoscape software (Shannon et al., 2003). A PCoA plot (based on Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity metrics) was used to graphically demonstrate the distance measure between each of the treatments based on their overlapping molecules, and this plot was visualized with the EMPeror Qiime2 plugin (Bolyen et al., 2019). To improve the knowledge about the chemical potential of our bacterial strain by increasing the metabolite annotation rates, we also performed in silico analysis with the NAP tool (da Silva et al., 2018) which allowed us to achieve MSI level 3 annotations (Sumner et al., 2007). For that, we constructed a library with compounds isolated from Pseudomonas spp. retrieved from the Natural Products Atlas database (van Santen et al., 2019). Then, we performed the analysis considering [M\u2009+\u2009H]+, [M\u2009+\u2009Na]+ and [M\u2009+\u2009K]+ as possible adducts for the hits and 15\u2009ppm as a tolerance for the accuracy of the exact mass of the candidate structures. The results can be accessed by the following link: https://proteomics2.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=92a813db795c433ba7426e63b46b413e.", "2.4. Antifungal bioassays", "The activity of extracts obtained from the Pseudomonas sp. strain cultivated on different culture media was evaluated against Rhizoctonia solani strains by the mycelial growth inhibition test (Rios et al., 1988), with some modifications. Briefly, after resuspension in sterilized dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and distilled water (1:9), the extracts were added to autoclaved PDA medium shortly before its solidification and gently stirred to assure homogenization and to reach a final concentration of 250\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL\u22121 of extracts on medium before pouring it into Petri dishes Plugs of 5\u2009mm of radius containing fresh fungal mycelium were added to the center of the treatment plates, which were incubated at 28\u00b0C for as long as necessary for the phytopathogens in each negative control plate to take up all available space for growth. As a positive control, we used the Maxim\u00ae fungicide, with its active ingredients diluted at the same concentration as the extracts, and as a negative control, we used the 10% DMSO solution. Each treatment was evaluated in triplicates against all the fungi strains. The percentage of fungal growth inhibition was measured with ImageJ software, the means were calculated and then compared by Tukey test with a script in the R language. The phytopathogenic R. solani strains used in this study are CMES 1861 (isolated from Glycine max), CMAA 1592 (isolated from Ocimum basilicum), CMAA 1417 (isolated from Cichorium endivia), CMAA 1588 (isolated from Solanum tuberosum) and CMAA 1589 (isolated from Origanum vulgare). Those were kindly provided by EMBRAPA - Soybean and EMBRAPA - Environment.", "2.5. Genomic mining of biosynthetic gene cluster and chemical-genomic annotation comparison", "The complete genome sequence of the Pseudomonas sp. strain So3.2b was previously obtained and reported (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Montero et al., 2023), which is available at National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) by the accession number CP080494.1. Biosynthetic gene clusters were identified through antiSMASH v6.1.1 (Blin et al., 2021) with \u201crelaxed\u201d detection strictness, for annotation of well-defined and low similarity clusters without incurring into false positives. Chemically annotated compounds were compared with genomic annotations to find similarities. NPA026209 and NPA026208 annotated as possible bananamides D and F, respectively, showed genetic structural similarity to a Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPS) cluster in region 7 (Supplementary Table S1). To confirm this similarity, protein-coding sequences of the Pseudomonas sp. strain So3.2b and biosynthetic gene cluster of bananamides D and F from Pseudomonas sp. strain COW3 (GenBank accession: MN480426.1) (Omoboye et al., 2019) were obtained (consulted 11/3/2022). Synthetic blocks were identified through local colinearity regions using progressive mauve alignment tool with Mauve v2.4.0.", "2.6. Genomic phylogenetic analysis", "A phylogenetic analysis was carried out for a better understanding of the evolutionary relationship between So3.2b strain and its biosynthetic potential. Phylogenetic distances were determined by constructing of core proteome of the available complete representative genomes of the NCBI (entered 11/10/2022) for Pseudomonas genus (\u00d7100) plus the bananamide-producer COW3 strain (total: 102 genomes, including our Antarctic strain). Core proteome were obtained with M1CR0B1AL1Z3R (Avram et al., 2019)1 using the parameters of 0.01 maximum E-value and 80.0% minimum identity in all compared genomes. Briefly, the tool extracts all ORFs from all genomes using Prodigal, detects homologous genes (all against all) using MMSEQS2 and then clusters them using MCL and uses MAFFT to reconstruct an amino acid (AA) multiple sequence alignment (Avram et al., 2019). Once aligned, M1CR0B1AL1Z3R reverse translates each AA alignment to get the corresponding codon alignment. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with this proteome alignment using maximum likelihood algorithm with RAxML (Stamatakis, 2014). The resulting tree was visualized using iTOl v6.6 (Letunic and Bork, 2021)."]
