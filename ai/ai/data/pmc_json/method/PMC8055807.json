(2020). Briefly, generated fragments upstream(PsrfA)-PnarG-downstream(PsrfA) and upstream(PsrfA)-PnasD-downstream(PsrfA) were ligated into SmaI digested plasmid pJOE4786.1 resulting in plasmids pRIK2 for PsrfA::PnarG and pPB1 for PsrfA::PnasD. After confirmation by sequencing, fragments of interest were digested of pRIK2 and pPB1 by HindIII and were ligated into plasmid pJOE6743.1 resulting in plasmids for chromosomal promoter exchange, called pRIK4 (PsrfA::PnarG) and pPB2 (PsrfA::PnasD). These plasmids were isolated and transformed in natural competent B. subtilis JABs24 cells. A markerless promoter exchange of PsrfA was ensured by mannose counterselection as described by Wenzel and Altenbuchner (2015). Final validation of successful integration was performed by sequencing and resulted in strains MG11 for PsrfA::PnarG and MG13 for PsrfA::PnasD. Using plasmids pKAM446 (PsrfA-lacZ), pKAM452 (PnarG-lacZ) and pSHX2 (PnasD-lacZ) for construction of reporter strains and the protocol described in Hoffmann et al. (2020), the integration of promoter-lacZ fusion into amyE locus was performed for strains JABs24, MG11 and MG13. This resulted in strains KM1016 (amyE::[PsrfA-lacZ, spcR]), MG12 (PsrfA::PnarG; amyE::[PnarG-lacZ, spcR]) and MG14 (PsrfA::PnasD; amyE::[PnasD-lacZ, spcR]), respectively.", "Cultivation medium and conditions", "Main cultivations were performed in 500 mL baffled shake flasks with relative filling volumes (Rv) of 10% (=\u20090.1 mL/mL), 50% (=\u20090.5 mL/mL) and 100% (=\u20091 mL/mL) at 120\u00a0rpm. This approach results in different oxygen availabilities in shake flasks (Heyman et al. 2019; Schiefelbein et al. 2013). In any case, even at 100% Rv, overflowing during shaking did not occur as the shake flask neck posed a sufficient barrier. Cultivations in bioreactors were performed in custom-built bioreactors (ZETA GmbH, Graz/Lieboch, Austria) equipped with foam centrifuge as described in Hoffmann et al. (2020) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Due to the installation and feed-program of the bioreactors, batch and feed media were prepared as g/kg respectively mol/kg.", "Preparation of LB medium for the first pre-culture and a modified mineral salt medium for all other shake flask and bioreactor cultivations was performed as described in Hoffmann et al. (2020). The concentrations of the buffer, MgSO4\u22197H2O and trace elements were the same, while the glucose concentration was increased to 40\u00a0g/L for shake flask cultivations and 20\u00a0g/kg for the bioreactor batch medium. The initial nitrogen source was 0.1\u00a0mol/L (or mol/kg) NaNO3 and 0.1\u00a0mol/L (or mol/kg) (NH4)2SO4, if not indicated otherwise in the results part. For bioreactor cultivations, a feed solution was prepared containing 400\u00a0g/kg glucose as well as 20 mL TES/kg and 3.69\u00a0g/kg MgSO4\u22197H2O.", "Pre-cultures and the main culture were prepared as described in Hoffmann et al. (2020). The second pre-culture was inoculated for 12\u201316\u00a0h. Bioreactor cultivations had an initial batch volume of 20\u00a0kg. The agitation rate was fixed at 300\u00a0rpm throughout cultivation. A constant aeration rate of 1.2\u00a0L/min, equal to 0.06 vvm at T0 and the lowest possible aeration rate with the given technical equipment, was set without further pO2 regulation. pH was maintained at 7 by addition of 4\u00a0M NaOH and 4\u00a0M HNO3, the latter one serving as self-regulated nitrate-feed due to the basic pH shift caused by anaerobic nitrate respiration. The foam centrifuge run at 2790\u00a0rpm when activated by a sensor in the headspace of the bioreactor vessel. The feed was started when glucose became depleting with a set growth rate of 0.03 1/h and an initial feed addition of 0.04\u00a0kg/h. The feed was limited to 2\u00a0kg.", "Sampling and sample analysis", "After measuring the OD600 (Biochrom WPA CO8000, Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK) of the samples, cell-free supernatants were stored at \u2013\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C. Cell dry weight (CDW) was calculated by dividing the OD600 by the factor 3.762, which was established previously (Geissler et al. 2019b). Glucose and surfactin concentrations were determined using an HPTLC method as specified in Geissler et al. (2017, 2019b). Nitrate, nitrite and ammonium concentrations were analyzed with spectrophotometric assays (nitrate: Cat. No. 1.09713.0001, nitrite: Cat. No. 1.14776.0001, ammonium: Cat. No. 1.14752.0001, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Miller units (MU) as indicator for the promoter activity of the lacZ-fused promoters were determined by the \u03b2-galactosidase assay as described in Hoffmann et al. (2020).", "Data analysis", "Process parameters were calculated in the same approach, means \u0394t yields and overall yields, as explained in Hoffmann et al. (2020). For bioreactor cultivations, all concentrations were converted to absolute values by multiplying the respective value by the weight of the medium. This allowed to compensate for the dilution occurred due to the addition of feed, acid and base solutions. All experiments were performed in duplicates. Depending on the aim of the respective experiment, either strain JABs24, KM1016, MG1 or MG5 was used as reference strain."]
