These sequences were first clustered via BLASTClust at 80% identity (Alva et al., 2016), and 1,132 representative sequences were obtained. The representative sequences were then used to construct a sequence similarity network under default parameters with an Alignment Score of 110 (Gerlt et al., 2015).", "Protein Expression and Purification", "DNA isolation and manipulation in actinomycete strains or E. coli were performed according to standard methods (Kieser et al., 2000). PCR amplifications were carried out on a Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems).
