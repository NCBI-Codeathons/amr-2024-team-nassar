["MATERIALS AND METHODS", "Inactivation of ABC transporters in yeast", "All yeast strains constructed in this work are derived from the yeast laboratory strains YPH500 (Mat\u03b1, ade2-101ochre, his3\u0394200, leu2\u03941, lys2-801amber, trp1\u03941, ura3-52) and YPH499 (47). For yeast gene nomenclature and composition of synthetic complete medium, see reference (48). Strains were routinely grown on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 2% agarose) and YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol, 2% agarose) to identify respiratory competent cells. Information on yeast genes can be found in the Saccharomyces Genome Database [https://www.yeastgenome.org/, see reference (49)]. The strains and their construction are listed in Table 1. Single, double, and triple mutants with inactivated ABC transporters Snq2p, Pdr12p, and Yor1p were generated. YOR1 was disrupted using the pDK30 plasmid kindly provided by Prof. Scott Moye-Rowley (University of Iowa). A restriction digest with BamHI + SacII released a 6.8 kb yor1::hisG-URA3-hisG fragment used for transformation (50). This disruption cassette was also used to transform strains YYM5 (snq2) and YRU75 (pdr12), as well as the snq2 pdr12 strain YRE108 (51), which were kindly provided by Prof. Karl Kuchler (Medical University Vienna). Selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid was used for the removal of the URA3 marker. YOR1 disruption was confirmed via PCR screening using internal primers yor1ver_fw and yor1ver_rv, as well as through spotting on YPGE (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 3% glycerol, 2% agarose, 3% ethanol) plates containing 0.1 to 0.3 \u00b5g/mL oligomycin. Subsequent gene disruptions in the generated triple mutant strain YRU74 were performed using the Cre/loxP vector system (52). Plasmid pOS4a (galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase and ADE2 as selection markers) (53) was used to excise the loxP-flanked markers. Flanking and internal primers were used to screen yeast transformants (for primer sequences, see Table 2).", "Sequences of primers used in this studya", "Primer name Sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032).", "yor1ver_fw GGTTACGCTATTGGTGCATG.", "yor1ver_rv GCAAGGAAAGTGACCAATG.", "dcka2-FW ATGCCATTACCTCCGTCAACATTGAACCAGAAATCTAATAGAGTCTCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC.", "dcka2-RV TTATTCAAACTTCGTTTTGAAAAACTTATGATCCATAGCCTCCTTCGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCT.", "cka2_scr-FW CAAAGTTGGATATCCCTAATGACC.", "cka2_scr-RV TTACTCAAAAGGTAAATGGCTCTCT.", "dlcb3-FW ATGGTAGATGGACTGAATACCTCGAACATTAGGAAAAGAGCCAGGTCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC.", "dlcb3-RV TTATGCTATATTTAAGAGGGAAAATAGGACGGGGCTGCACATTACCGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCT.", "lcb3_scr-FW AAGCCTACGTTTTGGACTCTCA.", "lcb3_scr-RV CATGGCCAGCACTATTTTCA.", "pUG72-REV GCGTTTACCGTATCGCAGAATGG.", "pUG72-FWD ATGGCCCAATCACAACCACATCTTAG.", "pUG73-REV ATGCTATCGCCAAGGCTGTCAAGG.", "pUG73-FWD GACACCTTCATCACCTAATTTCTCTTCAAC.", "VPS51_KO_ pUG_767_fw GCGTATTTGCGGTGAGACGGAATCTGACGAGGATATTAAGTACAG\ncagctgaagcttcgtacgc.", "VPS51_KO_ pUG_767_rv TCTCGAAGGAAGTGTTCGGTGAAAGCCACGATATGCCGCTGGAAA\ngcataggccactagtggatctg.", "KlLEU2 rev GTTAGAAATGTCTTGGATGCAGGTG.", "KlLEU2fwd CAGCAATGGCATTCAAGACCTTA.", "VPS51_KO_ upstream_ outside ATAGGTGAGGCTCTGCATAG.", "VPS51_KO_ downstream_ outside CGAAGGAAGTGTTCGGTGAAAGC.", "SmFumD_fw_ Leader tcccaacgaccgaaaacctgtattttcagggatccATGAAAGAACACCAGTGTAG.", "SmFumD_fw_ noLeader_MAQ tcccaacgaccgaaaacctgtattttcagggatccATGgctcaaactgacgacccaaa.", "SmFumD_rv gtcttcaggagcgagttctggctggcttgcacgtgTTACTTGGATGGTTGACAAG.", "CYC1-RV ggcgtgaatgtaagcgtgac.", "pVT-U_R4 GTGGCGAGAAAGGAAGGGAAGA.", "noHis_Seq_fw caaaccggatcggactactagc.", "The underlined part of the sequences is complementary to the beginning or end of the resistance cassette amplified from different plasmids, while the non-underlined part is complementary to the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the gene to be knocked out.", "Single deletions of candidate genes CKA2 and LCB3 were generated using plasmid pUG72 as a template to amplify the loxP-KlURA3-loxP cassette. Double mutants were obtained by using pUG73 as a template to generate a loxP-KlLEU2-loxP cassette. The resulting strain, YRU94 (snq2\u0394::hisG pdr12\u0394::hisG yor1\u0394::hisG cka2\u0394::loxP-URA3-loxP, lcb3\u0394::loxP-LEU2-loxP), was used for further work. Marker loss was achieved via galactose induction after transformation with pOS4a. Subsequently, a red ade2 mutant was picked from a YPD plate, indicating the loss of pOS4a in YRU94ML.", "To inactivate VPS51 in YRU94ML, primers VPS51_KO_pUG_767_fw and VPS51_KO_pUG_767_rv, providing the sequence overhangs for homologous recombination, were used to amplify a loxP\u2212 Kluyveromyces lactis LEU2-loxP construct from pUG73. The correct insertion of the marker (vps51\u0394::loxPKlLEU2-loxP) in the transformants was confirmed via colony PCR using oligonucleotides flanking the disruption cassette (VPS51_KO_upstream_outside and VPS51_KO_downstream_outside) and primers contained within the KlLEU2 gene (KlLEU2fwd and KlLEU2 rev), leading to strain YTKT1. Plasmid pBS49 (GAL1-Cre URA3) (54) was used for marker removal. The resulting strain after plasmid loss was designated YTKT33.", "Treatment with crude or purified fumonisins", "The crude fumonisin extract used during the construction of strains was produced as follows: autoclaved maize media (10 g cracked maize, 1.9 g saccharose, 0.125 g casein hydrolysate, and 5 mL of water) in a 220 mL CultureJar G9 Glass Plant Tissue Culture Vessel (PhytoTech Labs) with Magenta B-Cap vented lids (Bioworld 309300051) were inoculated with conidia of various Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum strains from our collections and incubated without shaking in the dark at 25\u00b0C for 29 days. After the addition of 25 mL of water, the cultures were homogenized, 25 mL of methanol was added, and extraction was performed by shaking for 30 minutes at 140 rpm at room temperature. Then, 1 mL aliquots were cleared by centrifugation (14,680 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes at room temperature). Samples were diluted 1:400 with methanol/water (1:1) for analysis using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The remaining homogenates were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until workup.", "All homogenates containing \u2265250 mg/L of FB1 were thawed, pooled, and centrifuged. Methanol (and partly water) was evaporated using a rotavapor at 35\u00b0C until precipitation occurred in the flask. The contents of the flask were centrifuged, and the precipitate was discarded. The fumonisin concentration of the remaining 160 mL of the red-brown, slightly viscous aqueous raw extract was determined, as described below, to be 5.3 g FB1/L. The extract was then slightly diluted and filter sterilized, and the working stock used in experiments was determined to contain 3.18 g/L FB1.", "For the determination of fumonisins, an Agilent 1100 series HPLC was coupled to a Sciex 3500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Separation was achieved on a Phenomenex Gemini C18 column (150\u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size) at 30\u00b0C. Mobile phase A consisted of methanol/water/acetic acid (40/59.9/0.1, vol/vol/vol), while mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% acetic acid in methanol. The initial gradient (0% B) was maintained for 0.5 min before 73% B was reached at 5.9 min. The column was washed with 100% B from 6.0 to 9.9 min before re-equilibration with 0% B from 10.0 to 13.0 min. Then, 1 \u00b5L of samples (diluted with 50% aqueous methanol if needed) was injected into a flow of 800 \u00b5L/min. Ionization was achieved using a TurboV electrospray source in positive ion mode, applying 4,000 V of ionspray voltage at 550\u00b0C, curtain gas of 35 psi, and gas 1 and gas 2 settings of 50 psi each. Selected ion monitoring was employed with 20 ms dwell times for each transition, followed by 5 ms pause times. The following transitions were used [analyte: Q1 mass (Da) >Q3 mass (Da), declustering potential (V), collision energy (eV)]: FB1: 722.3 > 334.2 Da (91 V, 57 eV); FB1 qual: 722.3 > 352.2 Da (91 V, 50 eV); FB2/FB3: 706.3 > 318.3 Da (91 V, 55 eV); FB2/FB3 qual: 706.3 > 336.1 Da (91 V, 50 eV).", "Solid FB1 was either provided by Dr. G. Jaunecker (Romer Labs, Tulln, Austria) or obtained from Fermentek (Jerusalem, Israel). For the comparison of the responses to different B-type fumonisins (Fig. 3), 1 mg of each of FB1, FB2, FB3 (>99%), and FB4 (>98%) was purchased from Fumizol Ltd. (Szeged, Hungary).", "Growth assays on solid and liquid media", "Both complex (YPD) and SC (synthetic complete) media (47) supplemented with FB1 were used to conduct growth inhibition tests. For plate assays, liquid overnight cultures were diluted back to an OD600 nm of 0.1. After reaching again about 0.3, they were diluted to an OD600 nm of 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001, and 3 \u00b5L of these suspensions was spotted on the agar plates. Photographs were taken after incubation at 30\u00b0C for 5 days. For comparing the sensitivity to FB1 of different strains in liquid media, CELLSTAROneWell flat bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Kremsm\u00fcnster, Austria) were placed in a Biotek Synergy H1 Hybrid microplate reader. Plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 24 h, and OD600 nm was measured every hour using a fully automated set-up. A 0.6N dilution series of the toxin was prepared manually by adding 120 \u00b5L of the previous toxin solution (200 \u00b5L in well 1) to 80 \u00b5L of prepared toxin-free media (in wells 2) and repeating this step in the following wells (wells 3\u201311) step by step. Then, 80 \u00b5L of inoculum was added to each well (1:1 dilution), leading to 11 different concentrations of FB1 and a no-toxin control (well 12). The initial OD600 of the strains was ~0.05 when diluted 1:1 with the FB1-YPD/SC mixture inside the well plate. Three replicates were used for each strain, and the growth after 24 h was analyzed by calculating the average of the OD600 of these replicates along with the standard deviation. The value of a blank (medium without yeast) was subtracted. In order to determine the response of the YTKT33 strain to different B-type fumonisins again, a dilution series of 0.6N starting at a concentration of 500 \u00b5M was prepared in a microtiter plate and SC medium with 250 \u00b5M set as the highest one and wells containing only the yeast strain serving as a control. Four replicates were used, and the mean was calculated based on the OD values measured after 24 h, along with the standard deviation.", "Expression of candidate genes", "Plasmid pYes2-PTEF1 was used to express different candidate genes expected to confer resistance against FB1. It contains URA3 as a selection marker, the TEF1 promoter, and a N-terminal 6xHis-tag (33). The empty vector, as well as one containing the Fusarium verticillioides self-resistance gene (33), FUM18, as a positive control, were kindly provided by Dr. Vito Valiante (Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, Hans Kn\u00f6ll Institute, Jena, Germany). The reading frames of other genes of interest were PCR-amplified using a polymerase with proof-reading activity (Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Vienna, Austria) and about 50-bp-long primers with 35-bp homology to the plasmid and the gene at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. The candidate genes were recombined behind the TEF1 promoter, and the resulting plasmids were recovered from yeast and transformed into Escherichia coli by electroporation. For sequence confirmation, primers pVT-U_R4 (see Table 2) and CYC1-RV were used.", "The original Sphingopyxis sp. MTA144 fumD esterase gene recoded for Pichia expression (34) was used as a template for PCR amplification. For generating the construct with the natural bacterial secretion signal, primers SmFumD_rv and SmFumD_fw_Leader were combined. In order to generate the fumD construct without a leader, primers SmFumD_rv and SmFumD_fw_noLeader_MAQ were used. The respective PCR products were co-transformed with the BamHI + Eco721 cut vectors for in vivo recombination. The Aspergillus amine oxidase gene as described (35) was ordered from BioCat (Heidelberg, Germany), flanked by a sequence containing BamHI and Eco721 for cloning into vector pYes2-PTEF1, yielding pTAK37. Modifications were added to this plasmid later on to test for potential negative effects of the 6xHis-tag. Therefore, pTAK37 was cut with BamHI and PvuII (removing the 6xHis-tag) and blunt ends religated after Klenow-fill in. This vector, pTAK38, was used to clone other detoxification genes and transformed into YTKT33 for spotting.", "Agar diffusion test", "Then, 6 mL of SC top agar equilibrated at 45\u00b0C was combined with 100 \u00b5L of YTKT33 (OD600 = 0.3) and poured into 60 mm-diameter petri dishes containing SC bottom agar. Sterile antibiotic discs containing either FB1 (5 \u00b5L of \u201ccrude FB1\u201d containing 3.18 mg/L FB1), water (control), or FUMzyme from Biomin (5 \u00b5L of 50 mg/mL) were placed on the solidified dry surface."]
