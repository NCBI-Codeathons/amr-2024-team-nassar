Ami dependence of the reaction rate was measured at 30\u00b0C with 1 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.01 or 0.1 nM enzyme for 20 to 200 nM or 200 nM to 10 \u03bcM Ami, respectively. ATP dependence was measured with 30 \u03bcM to 10 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 \u03bcM Ami, and 0.1 nM AmiN at 30\u00b0C. Mg2+ dependence was measured with 0.05 to 100 mM MgCl2, 0.2 to 0.4 mM ATP, 1 \u03bcM Ami, and 0.1 nM AmiN at 30\u00b0C. Metal dependence for AmiN and hAmiN was measured using 10 mM ATP, 10 mM Me2+, 1 \u03bcM Ami, and 0.1 nM enzyme at 30\u00b0C. Reaction mix was analyzed using Symmetry C18, 5 \u03bcm, 3.9 \u00d7 150 mm (Waters) reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column; buffer A [10 mM NH4OAc (pH 5.0) and 5% ACN], buffer B [10 mM NH4OAc (pH 5.0) and 80% ACN]; flow rate: 1 ml/min: gradient: 0 to 1 min (0% B), 1 to 11 min (0 to 67% B), and 11 to 11.5 min (67 to 100% B) on Chromaster HPLC System (Hitachi) as described previously (12). Amicoumacin and its phosphorylated product were monitored using Chromaster Fluorescence Detector (\u03bbex = 317 nm and \u03bbem = 469 nm). Reaction rates were determined in triplicate. KM and kcat constants were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten kinetics at 20 to 200 nM Ami concentrations, assuming [ATP\u2022Mg2+] >> [Ami].

Data represent means \u00b1 SD.", "Estimation of thermodynamic parameters of substrate binding", "The thermodynamic parameters of binding of ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/Ami to AmiN and Ami/phosphorylated Ami to AmiN-nucleotide complexes were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using a MicroCal iTC200 calorimeter (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, USA) at 25\u00b0C in 20 mM bis-tris-propane-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 2.5% glycerol, and 2 mM MgCl2 (or 2 mM CaCl2) (pH 8.5). Aliquots (2.5 \u03bcl) of ligands were injected into a 0.2-ml cell containing the protein solution to achieve a complete binding isotherm. Protein solution (20 \u03bcM) in the cell and 250 \u03bcM ligand in the titrant syringe were used for each experiment. In the case of AmiN-nucleotide complexes, samples contained 20 \u03bcM protein and 50 \u03bcM AMP-PNP or ADP. The heat of dilution was measured by injection of the ligand into the buffer solution; the values obtained were subtracted from the heat of reaction to calculate the effective heat of binding. All measurements were done in triplicate. The resulting titration curves were fitted and analyzed using the Microcal Origin software, assuming one set of binding sites. Affinity constants (Ka) and enthalpy variations (\u0394H) were determined, and entropy variations (\u0394S) were calculated from the equation\u0394G=\u2212RTlnKa=\u0394H\u2212T\u0394S", "Crystallization of AmiN and hAmiN", "AmiN and hAmiN crystals were grown at 19\u00b0C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. All samples were centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min before crystallization. Native AmiN crystals were produced by combining 1 \u03bcl of protein with a concentration of 25 mg/ml and an equal volume of crystallization solution containing 0.1 M tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2.5 to 2.65 M ammonium sulfate. AmiN in complex with ATP was crystallized under similar conditions with preliminary mixing of protein and ATP (added to a final concentration of 10 mM). In both cases, the crystals appeared within 12 to 24 hours. For crystallization of AmiN in complex with AMP-PNP, Mg2+, and Ami, protein with a final concentration of 70 mg/ml (1.8 mM) was mixed with AMP-PNP, Ami, and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10, 3.6, and 20 mM, respectively. Crystals were obtained by mixing 1 \u03bcl of protein complex solution and 1 \u03bcl of reservoir solution containing 0.1 M tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1.1 M LiCl, and 27.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000. These crystals appeared within 3 to 5 days. In the case of hAmiN, protein with a final concentration of 40 mg/ml (1 mM) was mixed with AMP-PNP, Ami, and MgCl2 or CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2.2, 2, and 20 mM, respectively. hAmiN crystals were produced using 1 \u03bcl of protein complex solution and 1 \u03bcl of the crystallization solution containing 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5), 0.2 M sodium acetate, and 27 to 29% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME (monomethyl ether).

The first collective variable (CV) corresponded to the interdomain distance, and the second corresponded to the relative twist of domains (fig. S14). To calculate the interdomain distance as the first CV, domain centers were designated as centers of mass of C\u03b1 atoms only, where the left domain is demarcated as a set of residues 1 to 55 and 84 to 110 and the right domain is demarcated as a set of residues 156 to 189 and 281 to 320. This CV was subsequently centered at the value corresponding to the closed AmiN kinase (30 \u00c5). The second CV, being the twist of protein fold, was described as a torsion angle between C\u03b1 atoms of residues 46, 4, 302, and 184 and centered at the value for closed AmiN kinase (107\u00b0).
