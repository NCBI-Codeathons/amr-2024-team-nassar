["2. Methods", "2.1. van Genes Discovery", "Amino acid (aa) sequences of SCO3594, SCO3595, and SCO3596 (VanH, VanA, and VanX) from Streptomyces (S.) coelicolor A3(2) were used as queries for BLASTP [56] against non-redundant protein sequence databases for each bacterial class listed in the NCBI Taxonomy database [57]. The BLASTP search used default algorithm parameters, but the maximum number of aligned sequences to display was set to 5000. The analysis was performed in May 2022. All obtained hits (with no regard to the corresponding e-values) were further investigated manually and mapped to the corresponding genomic records retrieved from either GenBank [58] or RefSeq [59] databases. Every bacterial taxon in which genes coding for SCO3594-95-96 homologs were found to be co-localized was further investigated. In total, we obtained 1 set of van genes for Anaerolineae, 48 for Bacilli, 23 for Clostridia, 2 for Erysipelotrichia, and 7 for Ktedonobacteria; the accession numbers for the discovered nucleic acid and aa sequences are summarized in Supplementary Excel File S1. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were not considered in further analyses. Degraded van loci (lacking either vanH, vanA, or vanX homologs), such as those previously observed in Desulfitobacterium (Dsf.) hafniense strains [52] and in some Bacilli spp. [25], were omitted to avoid overcomplicating the general picture.", "Routine analysis with all amino and nucleic acid sequences was conducted using Geneious 4.8.5 [60].", "2.2. Mapping MGE-Related Genes", "To discover and map MGE-related genes co-localized with van loci, aa sequences coded by ORFs from ca. 50 kbp (or less if not available) regions up- and downstream of van loci were analyzed with either CD-Search or Batch CD-Search [61,62]. This allowed us to identify proteins involved in DNA transfer and recombination or prophage-related proteins. Proteins that carried conserved domains typical for IS transposases were further used as queries for BLASTP (default algorithm parameters) against the ISfinder database [63], allowing us to identify those belonging to different IS families. If necessary, inverted repeat regions were identified using the EMBOSS einverted tool [64] with the default algorithm parameters, although the \u201cmaximum extent of repeats\u201d parameter was manually adjusted for each search to cover the whole region of interest. Putative prophage regions were inspected using Phaster [65] and PhisDetector [66] web servers under default search conditions.", "The accession numbers for MGE-related genes and proteins, as well as additional information are given in Supplementary Excel File S1.", "2.3. Phylogenetic Reconstruction", "Mega 11 (v.11.0.13) [67] software was used for the phylogenetic analysis. All trees were generated using the neighbor-joining method [68]. The confidence of the branching was estimated using an interior-branch test (1000 replicates) [69]. The evolutionary distances were computed using the JTT matrix-based method [70]. Ambiguous positions were removed with the pairwise deletion option. The rate variation among sites was modeled with a 5-parameter \u03c3 distribution. The phylogeny of VanH proteins was built using 269 aa sequences, including SCO2118 (putative d-Lac dehydrogenase from S. coelicolor A3(2)) as an outgroup (Supplementary FASTA File S1); the phylogeny of VanA was built using 265 aa sequences proteins, including SCO5560 (putative d-Ala-d-Ala ligase from S. coelicolor A3(2)) as an outgroup (Supplementary FASTA File S2); the phylogeny of VanHA concatenates was constructed by using 262 aa sequences and included concatenated SCO2118-SCO5560 as an outgroup (Supplementary FASTA File S3)."]
