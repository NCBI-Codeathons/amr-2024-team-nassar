DNA manipulation was conducted by following methods described previously (5). Briefly, for gene in-frame deletion, fusion fragments containing the downstream and upstream regions of target genes were cloned into pKNG101 and transformed into E. coli CC118 for construction of gene in-frame deletion constructs. Triparental mating was performed by using wild-type strain EC1 or a zmsA in-frame deletion mutant as a recipient strain. Mutants were screened on an MM agar plate supplemented with 5% (wt/vol) sucrose, and desired deletions were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. For complementation, the open reading frames (ORFs) of target genes were cloned into pBBR1-MCS4 and genes were expressed under the control of the lac promoter. The desired expression constructs were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing and introduced into corresponding mutants by triparental mating. The complementation strains were screened on MM agar plates containing ampicillin and verified by PCR. For construction of the strain expressing desABC heterologously, desC was cloned and expressed under the control of the tetO promoter in pAmob, while desAB were cloned into pBBR1-MCS4 and expressed under the control of the lac promoter. The resultant constructs, pBB-desAB and pAmob-desC, were cotransformed into E. coli DH5\u03b1 for heterologous expression of the desABC efflux pump genes.", "Primers used in this study.

The cells were then removed by centrifugation at 10,000\u2009rpm at 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Approximately 10-liter supernatants were then passed slowly through the column containing 500\u2009g of absorbent resin XAD7 (Sigma) at a flow rate of 1\u2009ml/min by following the method described previously (4). The column was consecutively eluted with 2\u2009liters of double-distilled H2O and 1\u2009liter of methanol prior to elution with 2 liters of acetone to obtain the elutes containing zeamines. The acetone in the elutes was evaporated, and the residues were dissolved in methanol to obtain crude zeamine antibiotics. For confirmation, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed using an Agilent 1260 infinity system connected to a Phenomenex Luna column (C18, 250\u2009by\u20094.6\u2009mm, 5\u2009\u03bcm) coupled with a Bruker maxis Q-TOF mass spectrometer to identify three main zeamine antibiotics, zeamine, zeamine I, and zeamine II (Fig.\u00a0S1). The crude zeamines were eluted with a gradient program of 5% to 95% (CH3CN supplemented with 1% formic acid in H2O) in 20\u2009min at a flow rate of 1\u2009ml/min. The mass spectrometer was employed in the positive ion mode, scanning from 100 to 2,000\u2009m/z.

Briefly, 2-fold dilutions of antibiotics in LB were added to 96-well plates, and fresh bacterial culture in LB medium was added to obtain about 2.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 CFU/ml in each well. The plates were incubated at 28\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 18\u2009h, and the minimum antibiotic concentration with no visible cell growth was defined as the MIC.", "Construction of phylogenic tree.", "A total of 59 amino acid sequences obtained from NCBI (Table\u00a0S3) were used in construction of the phylogenic tree, including 51 sequences found by blastp search, with the highest total score from Dickeya species and other proteobacterial species, 3 sequences from S. plymuthica strains containing homologs of the zms gene cluster, and 5 sequences with known substrate profiles. The protein sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.402 (36) in the \u201ceinsi\u201d mode, and the multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) was filtered for columns with high proportions of missing data using trimAl v1.4 (37) with the \u201c-gappyout\u201d option. The filtered MSA was analyzed by IQ-TREE v1.6.5 (38) to first perform a model selection with the \u201c-MF\u201d option (39), and then we carried out a maximum-likelihood tree inference under the best-fit model (\u201cLG+R5\u201d) with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap support (40).", "Survival assay.", "The survival assay was conducted by following the kill curve method described previously, with minor modifications (41). Briefly, fresh bacterial cultures in LB medium at exponential phase were collected and adjusted to an OD600 of about 1.0 (\u00b10.05). Cells from 1\u2009ml culture were harvested (4,000\u2009rpm, 4\u00b0C, 5\u2009min) and washed twice with LS5 salts (LS5 medium without sucrose). Bacterial cells were then resuspended in LS5 salts and added to 96-well plates with LS5 salts containing zeamines. The final concentration of zeamines in the assay was at 2-fold the MIC of the zmsA-desB mutant. The plates were incubated at 28\u00b0C with agitation at 200\u2009rpm, and the survivors were determined at specific time points by plating appropriate bacterial dilutions on LB plates.", "Growth kinetics assay measured in the flasks with LS5 medium.", "Bacterial growth curves in LS5 medium were measured by following the procedures described for zeamine preparation, with minor modifications. Briefly, overnight cell cultures were adjusted to an OD600 of about 0.5 (\u00b10.05) before inoculation at a ratio of 0.1%, vol/vol, and flasks were kept at 28\u00b0C with shaking at 150\u2009rpm. The optical density at 600\u2009nm was measured at different time points, as indicated, by the NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) with proper dilutions when necessary.", "Zeamine production assay.", "The assay of zeamine production was conducted by following a method described previously, with minor modifications (4). Briefly, 25\u2009ml LB agar was poured in 10-\u2009by\u200910-cm square plates and overlaid with 7.5\u2009ml 1% (wt/vol) agarose containing about 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 fresh E. coli DH5\u03b1 cells. The wells, at 4-mm diameter, were punched in the plate, and 30\u2009\u03bcl of cell-free supernatants (filter sterilized with a 0.22-\u03bcm pore filter) were added in each well. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24\u2009h, and the inhibition zone around the wells was measured. For semiquantification, one unit of zeamines was defined as the amount that could generate a 2-mm-diameter inhibitory zone around the well. The number of zeamine units per milliliter was calculated by multiplying the units of zeamines calculated from the bioassay by the fold change of sample volume used in the test (30\u2009\u03bcl) to the total volume (1\u2009ml).", "Construction of transcriptional fusion construct pDesABgfp and pDesAB3937gfp and flow cytometry analysis.", "As there is only a 20-bp interval region located between the ORFs of desA and desB, the desAB genes were considered to be located in the same operon. The promoter region of desAB genes was predicted by using the online tool provided by BPROM (42) (http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=bprom&group=programs&subgroup=gfindb). The 204-bp DNA fragment upstream of the ORF of desAB was amplified using the primer pair P-desAB-F and P-desAB-R (Table\u00a0S1) and ligated into the promoterless gfp-reporter plasmid pPROBE-NT (43) for generation of the construct pDesABgfp. pDesABgfp and pPROBE-NT were separately mobilized into wild-type EC1 and the zmsA mutant by triparental mating with the helper strain HB101(pRK2013) to construct EC1(pDesABgfp) and \u0394zmsA(pDesABgfp). 3937(pDesAB3937gfp) was constructed by a similar method. Expression of desAB and desAB3937 was analyzed by monitoring the average fluorescence of 50,000 cells when bacteria were grown in flasks with LS5 medium at different time points by a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) by following the method previously described (44).", "RNA extraction and real-time qPCR analysis.", "Bacterial cells were cultured and harvested at an OD600 of about 1.5 (\u00b10.05).

The purity of RNA was determined by gel electrophoresis, and the A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios were determined using a NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). In qPCR analysis, an aliquot of 300\u2009ng RNA sample was used for genomic DNA elimination and cDNA synthesis by a FastKing RT kit (with gDNase) (Tiangen Biotech, Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) by following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Specific primers for the desC, desB, and 16S rRNA genes (Table\u00a0S1) were designed by AlleleID 6.0 (PRIMER Biosoft). The housekeeping gene 16S rRNA was used as a reference. The PCR efficiency of each gene was determined using five DNA standards at different concentrations (10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001\u2009\u03bcg/ml). The qPCR analysis was conducted on a Quantstudio 6 Flex system using PowerUp SYBR green master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the following cycle profile: 1\u2009cycle at 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min and 95\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, followed by 40\u2009cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009s, 57\u00b0C for 15\u2009s, and 72\u00b0C for 30\u2009s.
