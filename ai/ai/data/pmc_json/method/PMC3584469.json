["Materials and Methods", "Bacterial strains", "S. clavuligerus DSM 41826 (DSM, Germany) and\nS. clavuligerus PTCC 1705 (Iranian Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Iran) were used\nin this study. Escherichia coli (E. coli) XL1-Blue\nwas also used in this study. The Streptomyces\nstrains were grown in defined conditions as described\npreviously (37). A suspension of Streptomyces\nspores was prepared in 20% (v/v) glycerol\nand stored at -20\u2103 (38). Cultures for the isolation\nof chromosomal DNA were prepared by inoculating\n100 ml of yeast extract medium (YEM) with\n100 \u00b5l of spore suspension. The YEM medium\nwas prepared as described previously (37). Luriabertani\n(LB) agar medium (that contained per liter:\n10 g of trypton, 5 g of bacto-yeast extract, 10 g\nof NaCl and 17 g of agar; pH= 7.5) supplemented\nwith Ampicillin (100 \u00b5g/ml), whenever required,\nwas used for the propagation of E. coli at 37\u2103.\nThe bacterial pellet was stored in 20% glycerol at\n-20\u2103.", "Vector", "The pBs SK reproduced from Stratagene Catalogue\nwas used as the vector in this study.", "Primers", "OLIGO\u00ae version 5.0 software (39) was used for\ndesigning all primers. The entire coding region\nof the gene was considered for primer selection.\nAccession number AJ000671.1, GI:2764535 (or\nU87786.2, GI:9280818) was used for obtaining\nthe claR sequence. These accession numbers are\nbased on S. clavuligerus ATCC 2706. This strain\nis the same as S. clavuligerus DSM 738, as mentioned\nin the NCBI. One set of primers (claR1)\nwas designed for nested PCR (F: 5'GCC TGG\nAGC AGA TGG AG 3'and R: 5'AGG TGC TGT\nCGC TGG TCT 3'). Two primers (claR2) were designed\nfor isolation of the claR gene from genomic\nDNA of S. clavuligerus (F: 5'CAT GGA TCC GTA\nTCT GTA CC 3' and R: 5'TAG GAT CGA TTC\nCGA AGC 3'). These primers were subjected to\nmodification at each 5' end in order to have two\nrecognition sites for BamHI and ClaI (Fig 1).", "Separation of total genomic DNA from Streptomyces", "Total genomic DNA was isolated from the liquid\nculture of Streptomyces using the High Pure PCR\nTemplate Preparation Kit (Roche; Cat. No.1 796\n828). The amount of DNA was quantified by gel\nelectrophoresis and spectrophotometric analysis.", "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR )", "The reaction mixture for PCR amplification\nwas prepared as follows: forward primer, 20\npM; reverse primer, 20 pM; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 4 \u00b5l; 10\u00d7PCR buffer without MgSO4\n(200 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM (NH4)2SO4, 100 mM\nKCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA)), 5 \u00b5l; MgSO4, 3 \u00b5l; deoxynucleoside\ntriphosphates (dNTPs), 2 \u00b5l (10 mM\neach dNTP); and H2O, up to 50 \u00b5l. A total of 100\nng of chromosomal DNA was added as the template\nDNA. The PCR reactions were then carried\nout using 0.3 \u00b5l (2.5 U/\u00b5l) of Pfu polymerase enzyme.\nThe amplification steps for the main PCR\nwere as follows: hot start at 95\u2103 for 5 minutes;\n33 cycles of denaturation at 94\u2103 for 1 minute,\nannealing at 60\u2103 for 1 minute, primer extension\nat 72\u2103 for 4 minutes, and a final extension at\n72\u2103 for 15 minutes. These conditions were set\nup for the modified primers. The amplification\nprocedure was slightly different for the nested\nprimers. The PCR was carried out normally for\n30-35 cycles. The products were visualized by a\nstandard electrophoresis procedure using 0.7%\n(W/V) agarose gels.", "Restriction endonuclease (RE) digestion", "Two sets of primers were designed not only to amplify the claR region, but also to integrate one unique\nrecognition site (BamHI and ClaI) in each end of\nthe amplified fragments. Digestion was performed\nfollowing the recommendations of the manufacturer\n(Fermentas, Germany). Required amounts of\nDNA samples (0.2-5 \u00b5g) were generally digested\nwith 5-10 units of restriction enzymes (BamHI and\nClaI) in a 10-20 \u00b5l final volume of restriction buffer\n(10\u00d7 buffer) for about 1-3 hours in a water bath at\nthe recommended temperature (normally 37\u2103). A\nsample was run on an agarose gel after incubation\nwith each enzyme, which ensured that the digestion\nwas done completely (40).", "DNA ligation", "DNA ligation was performed using one unit of T4\nDNA ligase (Fermentas, Germany) in the presence\nof 1\u00d7 ligation buffer. The 3:1 molar ratio of insert\nto vector was used in order to optimize transformation.\nIncubation was done at 16\u2103 overnight\n(40). The products of the ligase reaction (a 20 ng\naliquot from the completed ligase mixture) were\nanalyzed by electrophoresis on a 2 \u00d7 50 \u00d775 mm\nagarose gel (mini gel).", "Fig1Nucleotide sequence of the claR gene.

An aliquot\n(200 \u00b5l) of frozen competent cells were slowly\nthawed on ice for about 30 minutes. Cells were\ngently mixed with DNA and incubated on ice for\n30 minutes. The cells were then heat shocked at\n42\u2103 for 90 seconds. They were added to 2 ml LB\n(without antibiotic) and incubated at 37\u2103 for one\nhour in a shaking incubator. A total of 100 \u00b5l of\ntransformed cells were spread on the surface of the\nLB plate that contained an antibiotic. The plates\nwere allowed to dry before overnight incubation\nat 37\u2103 (40).", "Extraction of plasmid DNA from E. coli", "E. coli DNA was isolated according to the method\ndescribed by Holmes and Quigley (40). The overnight\nLB culture of E. coli was harvested by centrifugation\n(13K rpm, 30 seconds).

The tube\nthat contained bacterial lysate was placed in a boiling\nwater bath for 40 seconds before centrifugation\nat room temperature (12K rpm, 10 minutes). The\npellet of bacterial cell debris was removed using\na sterile toothpick.
