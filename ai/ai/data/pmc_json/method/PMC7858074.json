The HMMs used for analysis were phosphoenolpyruvate phosphomutase (pepM, TIGR02320), phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phnX, TIGR01422), phosphonoacetate hydrolase (phnA, TIGR02335), 2-AEP transaminase (phnW, TIGR02326 and TIGR03301), phosphonopyruvate hydrolase (palA, TIGR02321), phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (phnY, TIGR03250), HD-phosphohydrolase (phnZ, TIGR00277 and PF01966), and C-P lyase (phnJ, PF06007). Genomes with an HMM match were considered to have the associated metabolism. Genomes containing pepM were screened for the presence of the hvr locus by mapping them to the P. ananatis LMG 5342 gene cluster using Geneious Prime v2020.2.1 software. For pepM genes that did not correspond to the hvr operon, gene cluster boundaries around the pepM were deduced based on the presence of either flanking integrative and conjugative elements or genes that appeared to be in an operon together with pepM.

After overnight incubation at 30\u00b0C, the patches were picked and restreaked on LB-Kan without added DAP to select for P. ananatis recombinants that carry the deletion plasmids, which cannot replicate autonomously in P. ananatis, and inserted into the target locus by homologous recombination. Exconjugants were purified by streaking for isolated colonies on LB-Kan at 30\u00b0C and then by streaking on LB without antibiotics to allow for segregation of the integrated plasmid. Recombinants that had lost the integrated plasmid were then isolated by streaking on LB medium without NaCl containing 5% sucrose, which selects against the sacB gene encoded on the integrated deletion plasmid. Loss of the integrated plasmid was verified by showing that the purified recombinants were kanamycin sensitive. Finally, recombinants carrying the desired deletion were identified by PCR-based screening using primers described in Table S3.", "Introduction of IPTG-inducible Ptac system.", "Plasmid construct, pAP01, was introduced into WM6026 by electroporation with selection on LB\u2009+\u200950\u2009\u03bcg/ml kanamycin (LB-Kan).

The 48.0 g of dried material obtained by this process (sample A) was saved for further purification. The precipitated material saved from the above-described methanol extraction was subjected to a secondary 75% methanol extraction as described. Then the methanol-soluble fraction was dried to completion using initial rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying. The 1.60 g of dried material obtained by this process (sample B) was saved for further purification. Sample A was subjected to Fe3+-IMAC purification as follows: 10 g of Chelex resin (sodium form) was converted to the H+ form by incubation in 1 M HCl for 30 min, followed by washing with 5 column volumes (CV) of water.
