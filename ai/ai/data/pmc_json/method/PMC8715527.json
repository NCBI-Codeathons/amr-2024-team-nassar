["Materials and Methods", "Ethics Statement", "This study was performed strictly in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals for scientific purposes formulated by the Institutional Animal Care and use Committee of Changjiang Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences.", "Maintenance and Treatment of Channel Catfish", "All healthy and moderate size (100 \u00b1 20 g) channel catfish were purchased from Wuhan Baishazhou aquatic market. These fish were domesticated for one week at a temperature of 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C under laboratory conditions free of specific pathogens before infection. The pathogenic Y. ruckeri YZ strain (GenBank accession number is OL376599) was isolated from infected channel catfish. Y. ruckeri was cultured on a nutrient agar plate at 28\u00b0C; for 18 h, washed with sterile PBS, blown evenly, diluted to 108 CFU/mL and then inoculated in healthy channel catfish. A bacterial sample was also collected as a control. The experimental group was injected with 105 CFU/g of Y. ruckeri through the base of channel catfish ventral fin, and 100 fishes were used in the experimental group and the control group respectively. The same volume of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was injected into the same area of the channel catfish for the control group. The water temperature was maintained at 25\u00b0C throughout the experiment. The dynamics of the catfish were observed and recorded every 6h, which swimming behavior, symptom, mortality and so on. The preliminary experiments had confirmed that channel catfish can be successfully infected by Y. ruckeri at 6,12,24 hour post-injection(hpi). For dual RNA-seq assays, the trunk kidneys of 15 infected channel catfish were sampled at 6, 12 and 24 hpi. Five trunk kidneys were mixed as one sample. PBS-treated channel catfish and in vitrocultured Y. ruckeri (28\u00b0C) were used as controls. These experimental samples were then fixed using Trizol to extract total RNA.", "RNA Isolation, cDNA Library Construction and Sequencing", "Total RNA from trunk kidneys and Y. ruckeri were extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). A turbo DNA free DNase (Abion, USA) treatment was performed to remove possible contaminated genomic DNA. RNA samples were further purified using the RNA zero RNA Removal Kit (human/mouse/rat or Gram-negative bacteria) (Epicentre, USA). Samples of mRNA were then fragmented and cDNA was synthesized using a superscript double stranded cDNA synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, USA). After modification and purification, the enriched library fragments were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The library quality was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 biological analyzer (Agilent technology, USA). Second generation sequencing was performed using an Illumina novaseq sequencing platform.", "Illumina Sequencing, Data Processing and Quality Control", "The obtained reads were cleared using fastqc software (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and the content and quality of the remaining cleaning reads were evaluated. Low-quality reads and 3\u2019 adapter sequences were removed using Trim Galore. A comparative analysis was then performed using the reference genome of channel catfish and Y. ruckeri. For each sample belonging to the experimental and control groups, TopHat was used to align the reference genome sequence (16, 36).", "Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)", "To evaluate the transcript expression levels in the different groups, rsem software with default parameter settings was used to estimate the expression levels (relative abundance) of specific transcripts mapped per million fragments per thousand base transcripts (frkm) (37, 38). The expression levels of each transcript were transformed using base log2 (fpkm + 1). DESeq software was used to screen DEGs and calculate the fold changes of transcripts (39). Two-fold changes were considered for further study and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.", "GO Functional Annotation and Enrichment Analysis for DEGs", "To analyze the potential functions of DEGs, we first annotated them as depicted on the uniprot database (http://www.uniprot.org/). Then, the DEGs were functionally annotated using gene ontology (GO) terms (http://www.geneontology.org) with the use of Blast2GO (https://www.blast2go.com/) (40). All DEGs were mapped to GO terms in the GO database and the number of genes for every term was calculated. A hypergeometric test was used to detect the enriched GO terms of the DEGs when compared with the transcriptome background, as follows:", "In this formula, n represents the number of genes annotated with GO. N represents the number of DEGs in n, which is the number of genes mismatched with the annotation of specific GO terms. M is the number of DEGs. The calculated p value was subjected to Bonferroni correction. The corrected p value of 0.05 was determined as the threshold for statistical significance. When the corrected p value was < 0.05, the GO term was considered as significantly enriched.", "Pathway Analysis of DEGs", "The pathway analysis for the DEGs was annotated using blastall (http://nebc.nox.ac.uk/bioinformatics/docs/blastall.html) against the yoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) database. The enriched DEG pathways were determined using the same formula as used for GO analysis. In this formula, n represents the number of genes annotated using KEGG, N represents the number of DEGs in n, MRE represents the number of genes annotated by a specific pathway and M represents the number of DEGs.", "Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA)", "The WGCNA package in R was used to analyze the data (41). WGCNA helps identify functional pathways when studying interactions between species (42). The top 25% of genes were selected for WGCNA. A network was created based on results of the picksoftthreshold function. Hierarchical clustering and dynamic branch cutting were used to determine the stable module of tight junction genes. A hub gene was defined by module connectivity and measured by the absolute value of Pearson correlation. Hub genes in the module were considered to have functional significance. Key modules were visualized using Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/).", "Quantitative Real-Time Reverse-Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)", "qRT-PCR was used to confirm the expression levels of DEGs identified by RNA-seq analysis. Primers used are listed in \nTable\u00a01\n (43\u201348). In channel catfish, EF-1 \u03b1 was used as an endogenous control whereas gyrB was used for Y. ruckeri. qRT-PCR was performed using quantum Studio 6 flex (life technologies, USA) and melting curves were generated at the end of the run to confirm specificity. The 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method was used to calculate the relative levels of DEGs (49).", "Oligonucleotide primers used in qRT-PCR for DEG validation.", "Species Primers Sequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) Application.", "Channel catfish col1a2-F ATGGACGAAAAGGAGAGGCT Real-time PCR.", "col1a2-R GGACCAGTGTTACCATCAGC Real-time PCR.", "ddx58-qF ACCTGTTACCAGCCATCGTG Real-time PCR.", "ddx58-qR TTGGGAGCTCCTCCGTAGAT Real-time PCR.", "egln3-qF CCTCGGTGAAGCAATTGGTC Real-time PCR.", "egln3-qR ATGGCTTCGGATCCTCTCTC Real-time PCR.", "trim35-qF AGCGGCAGATTAAGGAGGAG Real-time PCR.", "trim35-qR GTCTTCGGCTCTCATCTCCT Real-time PCR.", "agxt-qF GAGAACGCGTGGCTGAAATC Real-time PCR.", "agxt-qR ACTGAGGATTCTCCGTGTGC Real-time PCR.", "C5ar11-qF CGCCAGCATCTTCACCCTGA Real-time PCR.", "C5ar11-qR GCCATGGCACAGCATACCCA Real-time PCR.", "tnfaip3-qF CACGCCTCGATGAGGGCAAT Real-time PCR.", "tnfaiP3-qR GGGCGCCCATAGTGCATCTT Real-time PCR.", "IL-1\u03b2-qF GTGTAAGCAGCAATCCAGTCA Real-time PCR.", "IL-1\u03b2-qR CAAGCACAGAACAGTCAGGTAT Real-time PCR.", "Hsp70-qF CTTGATGTTACCCCTCTGTCTCT Real-time PCR.", "Hsp70-qF TCAGAGTAGGTGGTGAAAGTCTG Real-time PCR.", "EF-1\u03b1-qF GTTGAAATGGTTCCTGGCAA Real-time PCR.", "EF-1\u03b1-qR TCAACACTCTTGATGACACCAAC Real-time PCR.", "Y. ruckeri fliC-qF CAGCGCTAAAGATGATGCAG Real-time PCR.", "fliC-qR AATACCGTCGTTGGCGTTAC Real-time PCR.", "osmy-qF CGGTTAGCGAATATGCCGGT Real-time PCR.", "osmy-qR ACAAAACCACGCCATCGGTA Real-time PCR.", "flhD -qF GATGGCTGATGCATTGTCTC Real-time PCR.", "flhD -qR AGATCATCCACGCGAGATTC Real-time PCR.", "gyrB-qF CGCTGGCCACTGTAAAGAAA Real-time PCR.", "gyrB-qR GGCACTTTAACCGATACCACG Real-time PCR.", "Statistical Analysis", "Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.
