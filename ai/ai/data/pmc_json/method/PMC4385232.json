["Materials and methods", "Chemicals", "All chemicals applied in the current study were of analytical grade and purchased from Carl Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany). The Surfactin standards for HPLC analysis were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Laborchemikalien GmbH (Seelze, Germany).", "Microorganism and strain maintenance", "The wildtype strain Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T was used for all experiments during this study. The microorganism was obtained from the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) and stored as glycerol stocks, prepared from a culture in Lysogeny Broth (Bertani 1951) from the exponential growth phase, at \u221280\u00b0C.", "Culture conditions", "Media", "The employed mineral salt medium was based on the fermentation medium of Cooper (Cooper et al. 1981): 8.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u00a0M MgSO4, 7.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M CaCl2, 4.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M FeSO4, 4.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M Na2EDTA, 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M MnSO4. In contrast to the original medium (40\u00a0g/L glucose) the concentration of glucose was altered to 2.5\u00a0g/L, 5\u00a0g/L, 7.5\u00a0g/L and 10\u00a0g/L, during various cultivations. Furthermore, the former nitrogen source 0.05\u00a0M NH4NO3 was replaced with 0.1\u00a0M NH4Cl and 0.1177\u00a0M NaNO3. The deployed concentration of the phosphate buffer demanded slight changes depending on its usage for inoculum cultures or fermentation processes. For the cultivation in serum bottles the original 0.07\u00a0M phosphate buffer (0.03\u00a0M KH2PO4 and 0.04\u00a0M Na2HPO4) was used, whereas for the cultivation in benchtop bioreactors a 0.01\u00a0M phosphate buffer was employed (4.29\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u00a0M KH2PO4 and 5.71\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u00a0M Na2HPO4).", "The preparation of medium for the cultivation in serum bottles demanded a different approach compared to the preparation of medium for the cultivation in benchtop bioreactors. Four different stock solutions were prepared for the cultivation in serum bottles. One stock solution contained the salt compounds (NH4Cl, NaNO3, KH2PO4, Na2HPO4) and was later completed to the final volume of 50 or 100\u00a0mL, respectively. The second stock solution included a 5.56-fold glucose solution of the final glucose concentration. In comparison, the third and fourth stock solution contained a 50-fold MgSO4 solution and a 1000-fold solution of the trace elements (CaCl2, FeSO4, Na2EDTA, MnSO4). All solutions were filled into separate serum bottles and anaerobic conditions were adjusted by 20 alternating cycles of purging with gas (20 vol.-% CO2 in N2, 45\u00a0s) and evacuating (70\u00a0mbar, 45\u00a0s). Subsequently the bottles were autoclaved and the salt stock solution was completed under anaerobic conditions to receive the final concentrations of glucose, MgSO4 and trace elements.", "For the preparation of the bioreactor medium four stock solutions were prepared in a similar fashion. However, the first stock solution (NH4Cl, NaNO3, KH2PO4, Na2HPO4) was autoclaved inside the bioreactor. Whereas the glucose, MgSO4 and trace elements stock solutions were prepared and autoclaved in separate vessels. The medium was completed inside the bioreactor after sterilization and thereafter anaerobic conditions were reached by purging the bioreactor with N2 (4 Lpm, 1050\u00a0rpm, 20\u00a0min, Figure\u00a02: valve 1 open).Figure 2\nModel of the employed fermentation system. A 2.5\u00a0L benchtop bioreactor was used for anaerobic cultivation of Bacillus subtilis DSM 10T. The bioreactor was equipped with two Rushton turbines, a temperature sensor, pH and pO2 electrodes, peristaltic pumps for pH control, an exhaust cooler and attached exhaust gas analysis, which were connected to a computer for online analysis. To adjust anaerobic conditions in the liquid medium and the head space of the bioreactor valve 1 was opened to allow a N2 flow through the sparger. During fermentation valve 1 was closed and N2 was allowed to flow through valve 2, enabling a constant gas flow through the head space.", "Figure 2\nModel of the employed fermentation system.

The second seed culture was inoculated with a resulting OD600 of 0.05 under anaerobic conditions in prepared serum bottles with 50 or 100\u00a0mL of mineral salt medium, respectively. The serum bottles were incubated in a horizontal position but otherwise in the same manner as the first seed culture. After 24\u00a0h of incubation approximately 200\u00a0mL of the second seed culture were used to inoculate the aqueous phase of the bioreactor (Figure\u00a01 A). The initial OD600 inside the bioreactor fluctuated between 0.03 and 0.07, depending on bacterial growth of the second seed culture.", "Cultivation in a 2.5\u00a0L benchtop bioreactor", "All cultivations were carried out in 2.5\u00a0L benchtop bioreactors (Minifors, HT Infors, Bottmingen, Switzerland) with 1.0\u00a0L mineral salt medium. The bioreactors were equipped with pH (Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Greifensee, Switzerland) and pO2 electrodes (Oxyferm, Hamilton Bonaduz AG, Bonaduz, Switzerland), a temperature sensor and Rushton turbines. The temperature was adjusted to 30\u00b0C and the pH was controlled to a value of 7.0 by the addition of 4\u00a0M NaOH or 4\u00a0M H3PO4 (Figure\u00a02). The stirrer was adjusted to 300\u00a0rpm the entire time of cultivation. The medium was not exposed to gas flow throughout the whole fermentation process to guarantee an absolutely foam-free cultivation. However, to avoid reflux of air through the exhaust cooler and to allow the measurement of CO2 through the exhaust gas analysis, a constant N2 gas flow through the headspace of the bioreactor with 0.1 Lpm (1.5\u00a0L headspace volume) was adjusted (Figure\u00a02: valve 2 open).", "The fermentation process was started with 1.0\u00a0L of the described mineral salt medium and the additional volume of the inoculated seed culture (200\u00a0mL). Since the bioreactor cultivation was realized as a batch cultivation, no further medium components were added. During the cultivation pH, pO2, CO2 exhaust, temperature, stirrer speed and addition of acid and base were consistently monitored (Figure\u00a02). Samples were taken from the cultivation broth (4\u00a0mL) without allowing any air flow inside the bioreactor. All fermentations were performed as duplicates."]
