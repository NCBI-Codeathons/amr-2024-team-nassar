["INTRODUCTION", "Specialized metabolites are natural products (NPs) that play essential roles by helping the producing strain to cope with various stresses, are used as weapons to outcompete neighboring commensals, or are required at particular physiological or developmental stages (1, 2). Besides their role in improving the fitness of microorganisms in their habitat, among others, molecules emanating from the so-called secondary metabolism are of foremost therapeutic and agroindustrial importance (3, 4). These bioactive compounds are produced by a form of machinery encoded by a group of genes\u2014a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC)\u2014that, in addition to biosynthetic genes, typically includes genes for expression control, self-resistance, and export (4\u20136).", "Genome sequencing of secondary-metabolite-producing microorganisms has revealed an enormous potential to increase the known chemical space (5), with the promise of new leads in human therapies or for sustainable agriculture. One of the drivers of the renewed interest in NPs was the discovery of so-called cryptic BGCs that are silent under routine laboratory conditions and may therefore specify molecules that had so far been missed during pharmaceutical screening (7\u20139). An approach that is rapidly gaining momentum is that of expressing cryptic BGCs in a heterologous chassis strain or superhost and exchanging promoter elements within the BGC with those that are expected to result in high levels of expression under laboratory conditions. However, there are several problems associated with this approach. First, it is still difficult to effectively apply it through high-throughput strategies, and it is hard to establish the promise of the activity of a certain BGC on the basis of the DNA sequence alone (10). Second, examples of NPs that are produced from multiple BGCs, or by strains in coculture, are accumulating (11, 12). Alternatively, a single BGC may also be responsible for the production of many (up to over 100) structurally related molecules that differ in terms of their activity (13\u201315), or BGCs can be associated into \u201csuperclusters\u201d that function to produce two or more similar molecules (16, 17). Thus, to optimally exploit the chemical space of NPs, we need to understand the connection between the genomic diversity and the chemical diversity of their biosynthetic pathways.", "Here we provide an example that further illustrates the complexity of analyses designed to estimate the metabolome profile as well as the industrial potential of a microorganism based on the genomic information alone. Our work revealed that the ferrous compounds called ferroverdins (Fig.\u00a01, structures 1 to 3 [18\u201320]), which are inhibitors of cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP) and thus are molecules potentially able to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis (21), and the antibiotics called bagremycins (Fig.\u00a01, structures 4 to 9 [22\u201324]) are synthesized from the same BGC. These molecules not only have completely different biological functions, but their biosynthesis also requires different environmental triggers. These findings challenge the concept that a given BGC is associated with production of similar compounds in terms of building blocks, structure, bioactivity, and conditions for production.", "FIG\u00a01Structures of ferroverdins and bagremycins produced by S. lunaelactis strains.
