["INTRODUCTION", "Biofilms are crowded structures containing cells and secreted polymers that form an adherent matrix. As a biofilm grows, internal chemical gradients become established because (i) cells near the biofilm edge consume substrates such as O2 before these resources can travel through the structure and (ii) cells in separate biofilm subregions release distinct products. Cells in microniches within biofilms use different tactics to survive, thus decreasing the efficacy of single-target treatments (1\u20135).", "The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known for its respiratory versatility and its production of small molecules that interact with the respiratory chain (6\u20139). Depending on the growth conditions, it can synthesize four major types of terminal oxidases, i.e., enzyme complexes that catalyze the final step of aerobic respiration, including high-affinity cbb3-type oxidases (\u201cCcos\u201d). The production of small molecules that interact with the respiratory chain is generally controlled by quorum-sensing pathways and/or regulators that respond to low-oxygen conditions (7, 10, 11). Among these compounds are the P. aeruginosa phenazines, a class of redox-cycling compounds that have been implicated in anaerobic survival (12, 13) and in electron transfer by the respiratory chain (9, 14). Together, the terminal oxidases and phenazines provide extensive and varied potential routes of metabolic electron flow for P. aeruginosa cells in biofilms. Adding to this complexity is the fact that P. aeruginosa has the capacity to produce cyanide, a potent inhibitor of heme-copper oxidases including cbb3-type oxidases (15\u201318). These observations raise questions about how P. aeruginosa mediates electron flow when O2 limitation and cyanide production threaten respiratory function.", "The P. aeruginosa genome contains multiple, differentially regulated genetic loci that produce full or partial Cco complexes, with functionally interchangeable subunits (19) (Fig. 1A and B). One of genes, ccoN4, encodes a so-called \u201corphan\u201d Cco subunit that contributes to wild-type (WT) biofilm formation and competitive fitness in biofilms (14). ccoN4 is part of a cluster that is strongly induced by cyanide (20). At first, it seems odd that cyanide induces ccoN4 expression because cyanide is known for its specific inhibition of oxidases like the Ccos (21). Nevertheless, studies have shown that ccoN4 contributes to resistance when exogenous cyanide is added to liquid cultures (19, 20). Although P. aeruginosa can produce a cyanide-insensitive oxidase (CIO) that does not contain a heme-copper center, a drawback to the use of this oxidase is that it has a low affinity for O2 relative to the Cco complexes. Moreover, viability studies have shown that CIO is not the sole contributor to P. aeruginosa cyanide resistance (19, 22). These observations suggest that the CcoN4 subunit is functional in the presence of cyanide and that its use may be preferred when high O2 affinity is beneficial such as in hypoxic biofilm settings.", "Fig 1Genomic arrangement of cco genes.

In this study, we investigated the role of MpaR in ccoN4 and mpaR expressions and its responsiveness to cyanide. Our findings support a model for the role of this regulatory protein in cyanide resistance across depth in P. aeruginosa biofilms."]
