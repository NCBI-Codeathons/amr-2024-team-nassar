["Introduction", "Many organisms harbor various small-molecule toxins that target ion channels as a means of defense from predation (Savitzky et al., 2012). Among these, batrachotoxin (BTX), a diet-acquired (Daly et al., 1994b; Daly et al., 1994a; Dumbacher et al., 2004) steroidal amine found in distantly related vertebrate lineages, including poisonous birds (Pitohui spp. and Ifrita kowaldi; Dumbacher et al., 1992; Dumbacher et al., 2000) and neotropical poison frogs (Phyllobates; Santos et al., 2016), stands out because of its lethality and its unusual ability to facilitate opening and prevent inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs; Catterall, 1977; Khodorov, 1985; Logan et al., 2016; Wang and Wang, 2003). This lipophilic, steroidal neurotoxin is thought to bind in the NaV inner pore (Wang and Wang, 2003). How vertebrates that bear BTX or other small-molecule toxins avoid autointoxication remains unresolved (Arbuckle et al., 2017; Almabruk et al., 2018; Hunter, 2018). Toxin-resistant mutants of target ion channels in host organisms (Tarvin et al., 2017; Bricelj et al., 2005; Hanifin and Gilly, 2015; Jost et al., 2008) or their predators (Geffeney et al., 2002; Geffeney et al., 2005; McGlothlin et al., 2016) have been suggested as the primary drivers of toxin resistance (Santos et al., 2016), an idea supported by examples of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant (Hanifin and Gilly, 2015; Jost et al., 2008; Geffeney et al., 2002; Geffeney et al., 2005; McGlothlin et al., 2016) and saxitoxin (STX)-resistant (Bricelj et al., 2005) NaVs, as well as epibatidine-resistant nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Tarvin et al., 2017) found in toxin-carrying metazoans. In poison frogs, an NaV domain IV segment 6 (DIVS6) pore-forming helix N\u2192T mutation has been proposed as the BTX resistance mechanism (Tarvin et al., 2016; Wang and Wang, 2017). Although the DIVS6 N\u2192T change reduces BTX sensitivity when tested in rat NaV1.4 (Wang and Wang, 2017), this variant occurs with very low frequency among Phyllobates terribilis (M\u00e1rquez et al., 2019), and is absent from Phyllobates aurotaenia (Tarvin et al., 2016; M\u00e1rquez et al., 2019), another poison frog having high BTX levels (Albuquerque et al., 1973). Given these issues and the absence of functional studies of poison frog NaVs, whether BTX-bearing animals rely on NaV mutations or other BTX autoresistance mechanisms remains unclear.", "Here, we clone and characterize NaVs from the BTX-bearing bird Pitohui uropygialis meridionalis (Pum) and two poison frog species that carry alkaloid toxins in the wild (P. terribilis [BTX]; Dendrobates tinctorius histrionicotoxin [HTX] and pumiliotoxin [PTX]). We found that the DIVS6 N\u2192T variant is absent from Pitohui and poison frog NaVs, incurs a strong cost that compromises channel function, and fails to produce BTX-resistant channels when tested in the context of poison frog NaVs. Most surprising, poison frogs proved resistant to BTX poisoning and poisoning by another small-molecule toxin, STX, despite expressing NaVs that are sensitive to both toxins. We further show that saxiphilin (Sxph), a high-affinity STX-binding protein found in frog plasma and organs (Yen et al., 2019; Mahar et al., 1991; Doyle et al., 1982; Morabito and Moczydlowski, 1994), can protect and rescue NaV-expressing cells from STX poisoning by sequestering the toxin. Hence, our data challenge the hypothesis that BTX autoresistance is rooted in NaV mutations, underscore the trade-offs between toxin-resistant mutations and fitness cost (Hague et al., 2018), and highlight the potential importance of alternative mechanisms such as toxin sequestration as strategies for protecting toxin-bearing species from autointoxication and environmental small-molecule threats."]
