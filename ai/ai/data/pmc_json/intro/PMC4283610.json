["INTRODUCTION", "Non-ribosomal peptides (NRP) and polyketides are produced by both fungi and bacteria, via non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS) and polyketide synthesis (PKS), respectively, and are often associated with aiding the organisms to adapt to, or survive in, a hostile environment such as the presence of competing microorganisms, nutrient limitation, and protection against insect immune systems (Meier and Burkart, 2009; Wiemann and Keller, 2014). Although many NRPs and polyketides have known functions [e.g., siderophores (iron acquisition) and antibiotics (bacterial inhibition)] and biomedical applications (e.g., cyclosporin, lovastatin, and mycophenolic acid), the true biological function of many NRPs and polyketides identified to date is unknown, and abrogation of the biosynthesis of certain NRPs, or polyketides, may be without major consequence for the organism (O\u2019Hanlon et al., 2011; Hansen et al., 2012; Steinchen et al., 2013).", "With respect to the actual processes, NRPS in fungi is mediated by a combination of large multi-functional enzymes known as NRP synthetases, which include adenylation, thiolation, condensation, and sometimes tailoring domains. NRP synthetases require post-translational modification via 4\u2032-phosphopantetheinylation, mediated by 4\u2032-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (4\u2032-PPTase), to yield the active holo-NRP synthetase. This modification, which requires coenzyme A (CoA) as the 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine source, requires that each thiolation domain within an NRP synthetase is modified at a specific serine residue (Stack et al., 2007). In addition, so-called decorating enzymes or domains are responsible for the modification of NRP biosynthetic intermediates, which may be either tethered to, or released from, the NRP synthetase during the modification process. Likewise, polyketides are biosynthesized from acyl CoA precursors (e.g., malonyl CoA) by multi-modular enzymes consisting of essential ketosynthase, acyl carrier protein and acyltransferase, amongst other, domains (Weissman, 2014). As shown for Streptomyces spp. intracellular ATP levels may also affect NRP production in fungi (Li et al., 2008). Unlike PK synthases, NRP synthetases require ATP for NRPS.", "Both proteogenic and non-proteogenic amino acids (e.g., ornithine) may be essential precursor substrates for NRP formation and during NRPS are conjugated together generally via peptide bond formation. Moreover, substrate amino acids can be modified either prior to, or during, NRPS (Thykaer and Nielsen, 2003; Chocklett and Sobrado, 2010). In addition, many other cellular components more commonly associated with primary metabolism are required for NRPS and PKS. Amongst others, these include S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), isoprenyl, and mevalonyl moieties, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), glutathione (GSH), malonyl CoA, and acetyl CoA (Davis et al., 2011; Scharf et al., 2011; Haas, 2012; Yasmin et al., 2012). This suggests significant interplay between what is currently considered to be primary and secondary metabolism and that essential re-consideration must be given to the integration of these two historically defined discrete systems.", "In fungi, the biosynthesis of a specific NRP is generally encoded by genes located within a gene cluster, which are often located in the sub-telomeric regions of chromosomes (McDonagh et al., 2008). The activity of these secondary metabolite (SM) gene clusters is controlled by local chromatin structure, which is effected via histone post-translational modification (e.g., methylation or acetylation). The influence of histone modifying enzymes on SM production was first reported for sterigmatocystin (ST) production and gene regulation in A. nidulans. The authors uncovered that histone deacetylase mutant \u0394hdaA bypassed the requirement for the general SM activator LaeA, resulting in overproduction of the subtelomeric metabolites ST and penicillin (Shwab et al., 2007). In the endophytic filamentous fungus Epichlo\u00eb festucae the gene clusters responsible for the production of bioprotective lolitrems and ergot alkaloids were shown to be derepressed following deletion of the genes encoding either the H3K9- (ClrD) or H3K27- (EzhB) histone methyltransferases. A further enhancement of cluster expression was evident when both of these methyltransferases were deleted (Chujo and Scott, 2014). Indeed, the production of many SM in Aspergillus spp. is controlled by a methyltransferase, laeA, and orthologs of this gene are found in many fungi (Bok and Keller, 2004). Interestingly, LaeA has been shown to counteract the establishment of heterochromatic marks thus activating SM production. Deletion of laeA in A. nidulans resulted in highly elevated H3K9 methylation levels suggesting that LaeA counteracts H3K9 trimethylation and thus heterochromatin formation at the ST locus (Reyes-Dominguez et al., 2010). The Velvet complex, which is comprised of the light-dependent regulators VeA and VelB, also regulates SM production, and serves to coordinate SM production and fungal development. It is now clear that the VelB\u2013VeA\u2013LaeA complex coordinates fungal sexual development and secondary metabolism (Bayram et al., 2008).", "Thus, it appears that a truly phenomenal degree of cross-talk exists between so-called primary and secondary metabolism, also involving genetic regulation, to facilitate NRP and polyketide, and indeed other SM, production (Figure 1). Primary metabolism is required to provide the essential biosynthetic precursors for NRPS, many NRPs share substrate amino acids and additional co-substrates, chromatin structure apparently controls much SM gene cluster expression, and evidence is also emerging that NRPS pathways interact such that alterations in the biosynthesis of specific NRPs may impact on the production of apparently unrelated metabolites (O\u2019Keeffe et al., 2014; Wiemann et al., 2014). This review is intended to highlight some of the metabolite cross-talk which has been identified to date, and to suggest possible future directions which may further illuminate our understanding of this complex molecular vista- which may, in part, necessitate the development of new models to augment current paradigms of distinct levels of cellular metabolism.", "FIGURE 1Systems overview.
