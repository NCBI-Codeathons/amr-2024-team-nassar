["1. Introduction", "Convergent evolution describes the evolution of similar phenotypes in evolutionarily divergent lineages [1,2]. Classic examples include shared body morphologies in fish and aquatic mammals or the evolution of shared ecotypes in placental and marsupial mammals [3,4]. The process can also describe molecular evolution, in which adaptive changes in orthologous genes or homologous positions in proteins underlie the evolution of similar phenotypes [5,6]. At the level of the protein, convergent evolution can inform our understanding of important structure\u2013function relationships as well as functional constraints that may limit the number of \u201csolutions\u201d to selection [7]. Specifically, convergent evolutionary outcomes may suggest that the complex mix of selection and functional constraints mediating protein evolution may be similar across lineages [6].", "A striking example of apparent convergent protein evolution is the evolution of TTX-resistant voltage-gated sodium ion channels (VGSCs) in salamanders, snakes, and octopuses that are exposed to the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) [8,9,10,11,12]. Salamanders in the genus Taricha possess TTX, which they use as a chemical defense [13]. Similarly, blue-ringed octopuses (Genus Hapalochlaena) possess high levels of TTX, which they use for both defense and as a venom [14,15,16,17]. Garter snakes in the genus Thamnophis consume TTX-bearing Taricha newts and are engaged in complex arms races across the range of sympatry between newt and snake populations in western North America [18,19,20,21]. All of these species have evolved organismal resistance to TTX through adaptive substitutions in VGSCs, the proteins that are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in most metazoans [22]. Although organismal resistance to TTX requires adaptation in multiple VGSC paralogs (e.g., both muscle- and nerve-specific proteins), a key step in the TTX-resistant phenotype appears to be the evolution of TTX resistance in the primary channel expressed in skeletal muscle (NaV1.4; newts and snakes) or in the primary TTX-sensitive ortholog in neurons (NaV1; Hapalochlaena octopuses).", "Convergent evolution in Taricha, Thamnophis, and Hapalochlaena extends beyond the gene level to include within-protein patterns of convergence. The ion-conducting pore of metazoan voltage-gated sodium channels is formed from four homologous protein domains that comprise the VGSC alpha subunit [23]. The outer pore of the channel is composed of amino acids from each of these domains and contains the TTX binding site, the ion selectivity filter, and other structures that modulate channel activity and ion conductance [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. Two highly conserved canonical amino acid motifs, DEKA and EEMD (sometimes EEID in invertebrates), form two rings of mostly negatively charged amino acids at the opening of the channel pore [30,33]. Amino acids in the innermost ring (DEKA) form the selectivity filter and interact directly with TTX [26,27,29,30]. Similarly, amino acids in the EEMD motif interact with TTX and modulate ion permeability [30,34]. Substitutions in all domains of the VGSC can render the channel TTX-insensitive but changes associated with resistance in NaV1.4 from Taricha and Thamnophis as well as NaV1 from Hapalochlaena are localized in domains III and IV [9,10,12]. Strikingly, Taricha and Thamnophis NaV1.4 as well as Hapalochlaena NaV1 all possess substitutions in the domain IV aspartic acid residue (D) of the EEMD motif as well as substitutions at an adjacent downstream residue (Figure 1). Channels from Taricha newts and Hapalochlaena octopuses share another amino acid substitution in the EEMD motif in which a threonine replaces the methionine (M) in domain III. Furthermore, Taricha and Thamnophis channels both possess substitutions in homologous isoleucine residues near the domain IV alanine residue (A) of the DEKA selectivity filter (Figure 1). Together, Taricha and Thamnophis NaV1.4 channels with these substitutions are extremely resistant to TTX block and require TTX concentrations in the 10\u2013100 \u00b5M range to block channel function, more than 1000 times the concentrations that block TTX-sensitive NaV1.4 channels from salamanders and snakes [9,10].", "A general explanation for the convergent patterns of amino acid substitutions seen in newt, snake, and octopus sodium channels is that the \u201csolution space\u201d to evolve a novel phenotype such as TTX resistance is limited by function [1,2,6]. Specifically, only a limited subset of substitutions will result in a protein that is still functional while at the same time include the novel phenotype. Voltage-gated sodium channel genes have been shown to experience strong purifying selection through most of the protein-coding portion of the genes [8]. Decades of work to understand the relationship between structure and function of these proteins have confirmed that complex interactions throughout the protein modulate fundamental properties, such as activation and inactivation, as well as toxin binding [35,36,37]. Furthermore, TTX binds specifically to a limited set of amino acid residues in VGSCs. Taken together, these elements suggest that the \u201csolution space\u201d to evolve TTX resistance may be limited to a small number of sites within the protein and that convergence across lineages results from these constraints.", "Current models of TTX interaction with VGSCs suggest that residues in the DEKA and EEMD motifs along with a limited number of other highly conserved residues, such as an aromatic amino acid positioned one residue downstream of the domain I aspartic acid (D) in the DEKA motif, modulate TTX binding [30,34,38,39,40]. Cryogenic EM studies of TTX bound to both invertebrate (NaVPaS) and vertebrate (hNaV1.7) VGSCs demonstrate that TTX forms polar contacts with amino acids in both of the negatively charged rings (DEKA and EEMD) as well as backbone amides of residues in the domain III portion of the channel pore [41,42]. These studies identified that an amino acid substitution at a conserved position in the pore shifts the number and position of polar contacts (e.g., hydrogen bonds and/or salt bridges) between TTX and amino acids in the channel. Models of TTX binding based on electrophysiological studies incorporate changes in the number and position of polar contacts between TTX and VGSCs to explain how amino acid substitutions in VGSCs alter toxin block [34,39,40]. The goal of our work was to establish whether amino acid substitutions that are linked to reduced toxin block in snake and newt channels also change the number and position of polar contacts between TTX and VGSCs, and if those changes converge on the same solution to alter how TTX binds in the pore.", "We modelled the interaction of TTX with a subset of TTX-resistant and non-resistant VGSCs from snakes, newts, and the blue-ringed octopus to directly test the hypothesis that the extreme resistance measured in some of these channels results from convergent modification of toxin binding. Specifically, we used homology modeling coupled with docking analysis (AutoDock Vina (VINA) and GNINA) to model TTX bound to these channels to estimate the number and position of polar contacts between TTX and the channel proteins. Our models incorporated both rigid and flexible amino acid sidechains (VINA-R, GNINA-R and GNINA-F) and allowed us to test the simple hypothesis that TTX resistance in these channels results from a convergent and predictable change in polar contacts between TTX and resistant VGSCs. Because we used TTX-resistant and non-resistant channels from two separate lineages for our analysis (e.g., different salamander species and different populations of the same snake species), we were able to examine within-lineage shifts in the formation of polar contacts to identify convergent patterns among lineages."]
