["Introduction", "Antibiotics are substances produced by micro-organisms antagonistic to the growth of other micro-organisms. The origin of antibiotics is ancient and some antibiotic production occurred over hundreds of million years ago (Wright 2007). Moreover, antibiotic resistance genes occurred over 2 billion years ago, indicating that antibiotic production also existed at that time (Hall and Barlow 2004; D\u2019Costa et al. 2011). It is an interesting question to know whether antibiotics influenced the evolution of ancient life.", "Antibiotics\u2019 production is often considered \u2018secondary metabolism\u2019 because it is unessential for the growth of the organism. In the natural environment, antibiotics kill or prevent the growth of competitive organisms. Thus, the role of antibiotics is to inhibit the growth of competitors; however, sub-lethal levels of antibiotics provide various effects on organisms, such as transcriptional modulation or enhancement of genetic variability (Goh et al. 2002; Couce and Bl\u00e1zquez 2009; Kohanski et al. 2010; Gutierrez et al. 2013; Bleich et al. 2015). Here we report a novel evolutionary role for antibiotic metabolism as a secondary metabolic enzyme that contributes to the origination of a primary metabolic enzyme.", "Previously, we discovered a novel antibiotic, \u201calaremycin\u201d, from the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. A012304 (Awa et al. 2005) (fig. 1). The molecular structure of alaremycin is related to 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA); therefore, it was designated alaremycin, from \u201cALArelated antibiotic\u201d produced by Streptomyces sp. ALA is a universal precursor of porphyrin in almost all living organisms and is converted to several important cofactors, such as heme and chlorophyll (Stojanovski et al. 2019; Bryant et al. 2020) (fig. 1). Alaremycin competitively binds to the substrate binding pocket of porphobilinogen synthase, which condenses two molecules of ALA to produce porphobilinogen for porphyrin biosynthesis (Heinemann et al. 2010). In our attempt to identify the biosynthetic genes of alaremycin, we unexpectedly found that one of the alaremycin synthetic enzymes is a close relative of ALA synthase (ALAS).", "Fig. 1.Structures of alaremycin and ALA. The unique structures in alaremycin are highlighted in red.", "Structures of alaremycin and ALA. The unique structures in alaremycin are highlighted in red.", "ALAS synthesizes ALA by condensing glycine and succinyl-co-enzyme A (CoA). This single-step pathway for ALA biosynthesis, known as the Shemin pathway, occurs in animals, protozoa, fungi and \u03b1-proteobacteria (Shemin and Rittenberg 1946; Stojanovski et al. 2019). In humans, ALAS catalyses the rate-limiting step for heme biosynthesis and its dysfunction is responsible for serious diseases, such as X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLPP) (Balwani 2019; Peoc\u2019h et al. 2019; Stojanovski et al. 2019). Most bacteria, archaea and plants synthesize ALA through an alternative pathway known as the C5 pathway (Jahn et al. 1992; Brzezowski et al. 2015; Layer 2021). This pathway includes three-step reactions beginning with glutamate (Nogaj and Beale 2005). Interestingly, the diversity of ALA biosynthetic pathways is in contrast to the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway wherein most steps are highly conserved among nearly all living organisms, although some procaryotes have been known to possess alternative pathways (Dailey et al. 2017). Since the C5 pathway is widely distributed in prokaryotes, it is considered a primitive pathway for ALA synthesis, whereas the Shemin pathway is modern. However, it is still unknown how and why the Shemin pathway developed and replaced the established C5 pathway in some ancient organisms.", "In the process of elucidating the alaremycin biosynthetic pathway, we discovered a significant similarity and phylogenetic relationship between ALAS and an alaremycin synthetic enzyme named AlmA. This led us to the idea that ALAS may have originated from an AlmA-like enzyme. We surmised that a feature of an antibiotic enzyme, which is non-essential but advantageous for survival, may enable an antibiotic enzyme to serve as an excellent evolutionary seed for a novel enzyme. This hypothesis contends that antibiotic synthetic enzymes play a role in enhancing evolution in a unique way that has not been previously considered.", "Here, we describe the results of genome sequencing of the alaremycin producer strain and subsequently characterize the alaremycin synthetic enzymes. Then, we demonstrate an evolutionary relationship between the alaremycin synthetic enzyme, AlmA and ALAS by two distinct approaches: a functional transformation of AlmA to ALAS by site-directed mutagenesis and the characterization of a predicted AlmA/ALAS common ancestor by ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). We discussed the evolutionary trajectory of ALAS and the evolutionary role of secondary metabolic enzymes, including AlmA-like proteins."]
