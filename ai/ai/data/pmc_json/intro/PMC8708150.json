["1. Introduction", "Recently, antibiotic resistance in various bacteria has emerged as a global threat to the treatment options for bacterial infections, and a subject of current research [1,2]. Antibiotic resistance is not only a major complication: antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is also one of the top ten global public health concerns flourishing all over the world. Antibiotics, antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitics are commonly known as antimicrobials. The scenario regarding the adverse effects of resistance is much bigger than its imagination. Antiviral drug resistance is also increasing at an alarming rate, and has become a concern for immunocompromised patients. Antiretroviral drugs are one of the best examples of this problem. Drug resistance to malaria parasites and fungal infections are increasing and infuriating the treatment situation. Dated back in May 2015, the WHO has developed Global Action Plan on AMR with five objectives to fight steps against AMR [3,4]. On 11 March 2020, WHO [5] declared that the world was under the calamity of a Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [6,7,8]. Interestingly, in November of the same year, World Antimicrobial Awareness Week was arranged, and a slogan of \u2018Antimicrobials Handle with Care\u2019 was highlighted to win the battle of antibiotic resistance [9], as, in the present situation, antibiotic misuse or excessive use can be related to COVID-19 treatment [10]. Few environmental bacteria are also believed to acquire antibiotic resistance determinants, which could be due to co-existence/evolution or horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [11,12]. Thus, all of these factors, along with the excessive use of antibiotics, are responsible for the emergence of resistance in isolates [13]. Threats caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive resistant bacterial strains have compelled scientists to explore new classes of antibiotics and novel approaches to tackle the problem of resistance [14,15].", "AMR is not only hindering the health sector but is also an economic burden for developed, as well as for developing countries [16]. Several treatment procedures are at risk without antibiotics, such as organ transplantation, chemotherapy, and surgeries. However, not only antibiotics are necessary for treating infectious diseases and small injuries. However, without common antibiotics, more expensive medicine, prolonging the duration of treatment and longer hospital exposure, will enhance the cost of treatment with the requirement of intensive care, and finally lead to life-threatening damage.", "In this review, we attempted to embellish the key features of antibiotic resistance (AMR), its consequences, mechanisms, regulation, association, and control strategies. Raising awareness and educating people are the most important steps for controlling antibiotic resistance. Irradiation of AMR is a goal of sustainable development, and together we must achieve this. The present review focuses on the surveillance of the origin of antibiotic resistance, genetic and functional characterization of resistance factors, and therapeutic options. Through this review, we also attempted to draw attention to the irrational use of antibiotics and their negative consequences. The review will help researchers/scientists in creating preventive tools and diagnostic pathways. Here, we tried to explore the multiple interaction impact of AMR with COVID-19 by understanding the usage of antimicrobial agents, the role of the healthcare system, and preventive measures."]
