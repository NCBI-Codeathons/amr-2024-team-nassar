["1. Introduction", "Phytopathogenic fungi can lead to substantial crop losses, as many are causative agents of plant diseases that are difficult to manage. Rhizoctonia solani is a necrotrophic soil fungus that can harm several commercial crops such as soybean, maize, and other essential plants from Amaranthaceae, Araceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Linaceae, Malvaceae, Poaceae, Rubiaceae, and Solanaceae families (Ajayi-Oyetunde and Bradley, 2018). Currently, R. solani management can be partially performed by agrochemicals. Still, this approach is costly and is often related to environmental risks like soil contamination, the extermination of non-targeted populations of life forms, and even the impact on human health (Tahmidur Rahman et al., 2020). From this perspective, using natural products isolated from antagonistic microorganisms for pest control is usually an advantageous alternative to using harmful pesticides in the field crops. Natural products are currently quoted as promising tools for sustainable crop management (Pirttil\u00e4 et al., 2021; Palmieri et al., 2022).", "However, several challenges must be overcome for a microbe-derived bioactive compound to be discovered and become a product (Li et al., 2019). For instance, chemical redundancy in biodiscovery programs has presented itself as an obstacle (Chandra Mohana et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2022). The natural products community has used different methodological strategies to overcome these difficulties and make biodiscovery more efficient. One of these is to search for bioactive compounds in strains from extreme environments, as these places constitute underexplored areas and, over time, extremophile microorganisms developed their ways to survive and occupy niches under drastic conditions of temperature, salinity, humidity, pH, radiation, and many other stresses (Yadav, 2021). Therefore, the natural history of these environments has led to the evolution of microbial groups with unique properties, as in those locations, their chemical potential could be enhanced naturally (Maurya et al., 2020). For example, several Pseudomonas strains from extreme environments such as polar regions led to isolating important novel bioactive compounds like diketopiperazines, phenazine alkaloids, pigments, and exopolysaccharides (Jayatilake et al., 1996; Carri\u00f3n et al., 2015; Styczynski et al., 2022).", "Another approach for biodiscovery programs consists of diversifying culture conditions, such as culture media composition, temperature, pH values, and other factors. The so-called OSMAC (One Strain, Many Compounds) strategies are based on the fact that even minor variations in culture conditions can promote the synthesis of several different secondary metabolites by the same strain (Bode et al., 2002). OSMAC experiments may be carried out by evaluating culture conditions individually to find the most exciting results, assisting the optimization of natural compound production through complete experimental planning with statistical analysis (Romano et al., 2018).", "On the other hand, -omics techniques can also aid in avoiding redundancy and rediscovery of natural products from microbial cultures. Through metabolomics, it is possible to explore the metabolic information of biological samples, annotate known compounds, recognize the structural differences in the compounds and their analogs by computational methods, and guide the selection of metabolites for isolation (Atanasov et al., 2021). Besides, the genomic era has increased the possibilities for discovering new natural products. Studies have demonstrated that the genes responsible for producing specialized bacterial metabolites often lie together within a genome as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Kenshole et al., 2021). The automated BGC finding in genome sequences has significantly contributed to the mining of microbial genomes for natural product discovery, also helping to predict their synthesis pathways, regulation, transport, and molecular structure in some cases (Kenshole et al., 2021). Hence, the combination of metabolomics and genomics allows the establishment of links between BGCs and the metabolites, increasing the chances of predicting bioactivity and molecular structures of potentially novel compounds (Le\u00e3o et al., 2022).", "The genus Pseudomonas, one of the most abundant groups of bacteria dwelling in the soil and plant rhizosphere, is known due to its broad lines of action in agricultural needs, including the production of several enzymes and metabolites skilled in the suppression of phytopathogens (Nadeem et al., 2016). Currently, some Pseudomonas-based bioproducts are available on the market to implement the control of essential plant diseases agents like Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum graminicola, Erwinia amylovora, Fusarium oxisporum, Michridichium nivale, Sclerotinea homeocarpa, and others with equal importance (Korshunova et al., 2021). However, those are strain-based products. Comparatively, there are only a few commercial products based on Pseudomonas-derived metabolites, despite the large number of natural products isolated from them (Jahanshah et al., 2019; Mevers et al., 2019). Also, some Pseudomonas strains and other groups prospected for commercial formulations can cause opportunistic infections, requiring more sophisticated characterizations for safe use (Kumari et al., 2022). In this sense, it is essential to demonstrate the bioactivity of the strain\u2019s extracts, as their natural products may represent better options to be applied in the field than the strains per se. We had previously isolated a bacterial strain (So3.2b) from Antarctic soil. We identified it through complete genome analysis as a Pseudomonas specie, with an Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) of 99.33 and 99.07% with the species P. shahriarae and P. fluorescens, respectively (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Montero et al., 2023). Here, we describe the chemical potential of this strain by using OSMAC cultivation approaches, metabologenomics analysis, and elucidating its bioactivity against five strains of R. solani from different plant sources."]
