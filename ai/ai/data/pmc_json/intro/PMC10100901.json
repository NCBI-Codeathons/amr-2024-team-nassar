["INTRODUCTION", "Identifying novel Streptomyces species is crucial in the search for new specialized metabolites with antibiotic and anticancer activities. This undertaking can address the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (1). Members of the phylum Actinobacteria serve as a primary source of specialized metabolites that comprise 10% of the 211,000 described bacterial sequences in the NCBI database (2). From the 39% estimated Actinobacteria specialized metabolites (3), 80% were produced by members in the genus Streptomyces. In fact, 5 to 10% of the Streptomyces genome is dedicated to specialized metabolism, and most of the products remained undiscovered (4). The specialized metabolites from Streptomyces species are largely represented by nonribosomal peptides and polyketides (5). These compounds can have a wide array of bioactivities, such as antimicrobial, anticancer, antiparasitic, or immunosuppressant activities, or other therapeutic agents (6).", "There are more than 4,700 halogenated compounds reported for which the halogen moiety is important for target specificity and enhances the compound\u2019s pharmacological activities (7). In 2021, 14 of 50 molecules approved by the FDA were halogen-containing drugs that displayed a broad range of antibiotic and anticancer activities (8). The genus Streptomyces produces a diverse set of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), accounting for 20 to 40 genomic regions for specialized metabolites biosynthesis (9) which conventional strategies fail to uncover. The advancements in genomics, bioinformatics, and metabolomics have accelerated the identification and isolation of chemically diverse natural products (10). Some of the well-known chlorinated specialized metabolites derived from Streptomyces are the antibiotics vancomycin (11) and chloramphenicol (12), the antitumor agent rebeccamycin (13), and the antifungal agent pyrrolnitrin (14).", "Traditionally, compounds from a bioactive microbial strain were isolated by bioassay-guided approaches (15, 16). Meanwhile, bioinformatics-driven predictions using whole-genome sequencing have uncovered the core BGCs and cryptic metabolites, followed by the integration of high-resolution metabolomics (17) for specialized metabolite identification. The genome-based bioprospecting (17) and metabolomics-enabled approaches (18) opened a new era in natural product drug discovery and development.", "From January 2015 to December 2020, there was a rising number of Streptomyces species isolated from different ecological niches (19). During these 6\u2009years, 135 new Streptomyces species were recovered from terrestrial (n\u2009=\u2009108) and marine (n\u2009=\u200927) sources, highlighting 121 Streptomyces species as prolific producers of 279 new specialized metabolites with wide pharmaceutical applications (19). In the year 2020 alone, 74 novel specialized metabolites were identified from Streptomyces species, with the largest portion isolated from marine-derived Streptomyces (20). From 2015 to 2020, 71% of the novel marine-derived Streptomyces species were recovered from marine sediments (19). These reports demonstrated that novel Streptomyces species from marine sediments play a significant role as sources of new bioactive specialized metabolites.", "In the last 5 years, our laboratory has explored the marine sediments of the Philippine archipelago for antibiotic- and anticancer-producing Streptomyces and has reported the bioactive specialized metabolites they produce (15, 21\u201323). In the present study, a novel Streptomyces strain isolated from marine sediments of Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park in the middle of Sulu Sea, Philippines, was investigated for its phylogenetic, phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and genomic features, based on its whole-genome sequence. Based on this array of testing and data analyses, marine sediment-derived actinomycete strain DSD3025T is proposed to represent a novel Streptomyces species named Streptomyces tubbatahanensis sp. nov. (DSD3025T = DSM 33792T). S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T was part of the over 2,000 Actinobacteria library collection reported from the marine sediments collected from different sampling sites in the Philippine archipelago (21).", "The antibiotic and anticancer potentials of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T were explored via genome mining, metabolite profiling, bioinformatics, and bioassays. The S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome encodes 29 putative BGCs, including a BGC of interest that contains tryptophan halogenase and flavin reductase genes, a two-component halogenase/reductase system. The bioinformatics analysis and BGC evaluation predicted compounds belonging to PKS I, PKS II, and NRPS moieties. Metabolite profiling of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T crude extract by using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization\u2013time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-TOF-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis identified chlocarbazomycin A compound 1, a recently discovered halogenated carbazole alkaloid, from its closely related Streptomyces species as a metabolite. Aside from compound 1, several halogenated compounds were produced by S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T. The extract induced cell death via membrane damage of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA-44 and inhibited growth proliferation of MCF-7, HCT-116, and A2780 cancer cell lines. Moreover, compound 1 had antibacterial activity against S. aureus ATCC BAA-44 and Streptococcus pyogenes and showed antiproliferative activity against HCT-116 and A2780 cancer cell lines. Based on genome annotation data and bioinformatics analysis, we have propose the biosynthetic pathway of compound 1 in S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T."]
