["INTRODUCTION", "The number of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms is rising and poses a major threat to society. One widely discussed survey from antimicrobial resistance collaborators, published in early 2022, estimated that 4.97 million deaths globally were associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in 2019 alone (1). The majority of currently used antibiotics target a limited number of processes common to most microorganisms: cell wall integrity (beta-lactams and glycopeptides), cell membrane (lipopeptides), translation (chloramphenicol and macrolides), transcription (rifamycins), and DNA replication (fluoroquinolones). Several papers have argued that new antimicrobial treatments may be discovered if we can alter the bacterial metabolic state, as many antibiotics are only bactericidal against metabolically active bacteria (2\u20134). This is exemplified by the increase in bacterial aminoglycoside uptake stimulated by the addition of simple metabolites, such as fructose, mannitol, or glucose, the catabolism of which increases the proton motive force (PMF) and electric potential across the membrane (\u0394\u03a8) and kills otherwise dormant bacteria (5). Similarly, it has been reported that differences in bicarbonate concentration between an infection and typical in vitro screening in Mueller-Hinton broth can affect drug translatability. Farha et al. elegantly showed that this is probably because bicarbonate dissipates the \u0394pH component of the PMF, causing a compensatory increase in the \u0394\u03a8 (6, 7).", "These deviations from a simplistic model of one antibiotic blocking a single essential process beg a more nuanced view of bacterial physiology during infections and the ultimate causes of bacterial death beyond the target-focused proximal causes, as discussed by Baquero and Levin (8).", "Polyether ionophores, natural products typically produced by Streptomycetes, fit this particular description well. They are a large class of structurally diverse amphiphilic antibiotics with the ability to perturb cellular ion gradients by affecting the transmembrane electroneutral exchange of ions/protons down a concentration gradient (9\u201311). The molecules achieve this by undergoing a dynamic conformational change upon binding to the cation. This initial ion complex then undergoes a conformational change to fully encapsulate the bound ion by orienting multiple polar groups toward the cavity interior. Conversely, hydrophobic groups are directed to the exterior, allowing diffusion of the ionophore-ion complex across the lipid bilayer (12). The action of ionophores in (bacterial) cells depends on multiple parameters that transcend this simple, canonical mechanism. Depending on their specific structure, ionophores have differential affinities for different cations and likely have differing ion-transport dynamics and membrane affinities. As such, exposure to a given ionophore constitutes a unique perturbation of both metal-ion and proton gradients that a bacterium would attempt to counteract. Polyether ionophores can also affect eukaryotic cells, and while some compounds are used extensively as oral antiparasitic agents in agriculture, the development of ionophore antibiotics for human use has not been pursued due to the risk of toxicity. This is clearly a multifaceted situation; however, the best interpretation currently is that many organisms can tolerate polyether ionophores and that dosing schedules can be adapted to increase compliance (13). Despite their extensive use in animals, there is no evidence of cross-resistance between polyether ionophores and other antibiotics, which is interesting in relation to antimicrobial resistance (14).", "We hypothesize that the differences in membrane composition between mammalian and bacterial cells can be exploited to prepare ionophores with acceptable therapeutic indices for use in certain clinical scenarios to treat resistant bacterial infections in humans. Recently, as an initial milestone toward this end, we described synthetic polyether ionophores with enhanced inhibitory selectivity for bacterial cells versus mammalian cells compared to a series of benchmarked natural products (15). In the present study, we systematically compared eight members of the natural polyether ionophore class (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). While many of these agents have been subject to earlier investigation for their antibiotic properties, these data are often generated under different experimental conditions, which we suspected might confound similarities (or differences) between the compounds. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time the antimicrobial properties of this class of compounds against bacterial biofilms and persister cells. Our data demonstrate surprising differences between members of this family of antibiotics and, furthermore, uncover inhibitory profiles for selected compounds that prompt investigations in preclinical infection models and further structure activity relationship (SAR) investigations."]
