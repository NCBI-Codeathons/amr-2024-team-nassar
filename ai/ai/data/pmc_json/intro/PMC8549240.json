["Introduction", "ActinoBase (https://actinobase.org) was established in 2019 with the support of the UK Microbiology Society as a Wiki-style initiative for the actinomycete research community. It aims to create a communal space to distribute knowledge and resources. Last year, ActinoBase published a review highlighting ten publications of important contributions to the field from 2019 [1]. This second review showcases 14 articles that integrate perspectives in actinomycete research from 2020 and early 2021, covering four main areas: i) technology and methodology; ii) specialised metabolites; iii) development and regulation; and iv) ecology and host interactions (Fig. 1).", "Fig. 1.Integrating Perspectives in actinomycete research is accomplished by using a variety of different tools covering the four research areas: Development and Regulation (DR, blue); Specialised Metabolites (SM, orange); Technology and Methodology (TM, grey); and Ecology and Host Interactions (EH, yellow).

They are widely distributed across ecosystems, ubiquitous in soil and water habitats, and can live in symbiosis with higher eukaryotes [3]. A striking feature of actinomycetes is that they produce chemically diverse specialised metabolites (SMs). SMs are compounds not essential for maintenance and growth, but often play a critical role in interspecies interactions [4]. Additionally, many SMs are of therapeutical value [5], constituting a rich resource for drug discovery [6]. SMs are often referred to as natural products (NPs) as well, this wider term encompasses any compound made by a living organism. Due to the current antimicrobial crisis, there is a need to improve the finding of novel antibiotics from actinomycetes, by developing advances in the detection/production pipeline, and applying integrative approaches to unveil SMs function [7]. For instance, SMs production in \n\nStreptomyces\n\n is linked to its life cycle [8\u201310], highlighting the importance of understanding its complex developmental regulation [11].", "SMs are genetically encoded small molecules produced by a group of co-occurring genes referred to as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), involved in synthesising one or more structurally-similar molecules [5, 12]. The genomic era has opened a new roadmap for the study of BGCs with genome mining as a prominent strategy to find candidates for novel bioactive compounds [4, 13, 14]. This has allowed researchers to uncover thousands of new BGCs of different classes, including polyketides (PKs); non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) [15\u201318]; PK-NRP hybrid compounds; ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) such as lanthipeptides or thiopeptides [19\u201321]; and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [22, 23]; among others [24\u201328].", "Although genomics has revealed key elements of SMs biosynthesis, there are still challenges to overcome. Their low production, the rediscovery of known compounds, and a general lack of understanding of the role of these compounds in nature, as well as the fact that many organisms remain unculturable [29, 30]. Moreover, many computational tools for high-throughput data mining have been developed to support BGCs prioritisation and dereplication [31]. Handling big data requires prioritisation to establish selection criteria for certain BGCs based on the specific research context [32]. Dereplication is selecting a BGC based on its novelty, often achieved by comparing with databases such as Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster (MIBiG) [33, 34].", "Additionally, advances in synthetic biology have improved the genetic manipulation of actinomycetes, helping to characterize and functionally validate BGCs predictions [35\u201337]. Furthermore, engineering BGCs has been crucial to unlocking their potential since most BGCs are silent or cryptic under controlled laboratory conditions [38]. Recent definitions for cryptic and silent BGCs describe cryptic as a BGC where the compound is unknown, but its biosynthesis is not; and silent as the compound is undetectable [38]. In this context, understanding actinomycete relationships with the environment and other organisms is a crucial factor when searching for BGC elicitors, referred to as molecules or signals that can trigger the expression of a certain BGC [11].", "Currently, integrative approaches are used to fill these knowledge gaps, which ultimately deepen our understanding of actinomycete biology. This trend is the central theme of this review, which highlights recent studies from 2020 and early 2021 that integrated genomic, metabolomic, transcriptomic, genetic engineering, and ecological data to provide significant insights in actinomycete research.
