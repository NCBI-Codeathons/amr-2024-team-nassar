["Introduction", "The wide metabolic variety within the fungal kingdom continues to supply an opulent source for novel drugs. The physiological and chemical diversity in the fungal kingdom leads to the identification of novel bioprocesses depending on fungi that can meet the demands of the current society for creative pharmaceuticals and antimicrobials. Huge numbers of secondary metabolites were previously detected in the fungal kingdom. However, the evolution of the discovery of proper bioactive secondary metabolites to their applications remains a challenge. Penicillium is a diverse genus distributed worldwide in various habitats. Although DNA sequences are necessary for the strong identification of different species of Penicillium, there is currently no universal reference database for verification of its genus. Penicillium genera contain more than 354 accepted species [1], which are a vital industrial unit for the biosynthesis of many chemically and structurally diverse bioactive secondary metabolites, including significant pharmaceutical compounds [2, 3]. However, the representation of fungal kingdoms in industrial bioprocesses is still limited, and the improvement of the production of significant compounds is considered an intensive challenge and remains expensive. Mycophenolic acid (6-(4-hydroxy-6-methoxy methyl 3oxophthalanyl)-4-methyl-4-hexenoic acid, C17H20O6 (MPA) is a famous secondary metabolite [4] that was discovered as a product of Penicillium brevicompactum before the start of the 20th century. Some Penicillium species have also been reported to produce it, including P. brevicompactum, P. viridicatum, P. stoloniferum and P. roquefourti [5\u20137]. Mycophenolic acid and its precursors, 5-methylorsellinic acid and 5,7-dihydroxy4-methylphthalide, were also identified as secondary metabolites of the yeast Byssochlamys nivea [8]. Due to its immunosuppressive and antimicrobial properties, it has been characterized as an important bioactive compound with various biomedical applications [9]. Additionally, MPA has regular medical applications as an immunosuppressive drug in the form of mycophenolate mofetil, which has been used to treat different autoimmune diseases [4, 10, 11]. Much interest has been directed to the industrial production of MPA due to its potent antiviral effects [12, 13]. Recent studies proved that MPA has an effective antiviral activity against MERS-CoV, human coronavirus (HCoV)\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010NL63, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 [14\u201316], and reported that the combination of MPA and interferon can be used for the treatment of COVID-19. For this intensive importance of MPA, it is necessary to search for a new Penicillium species to produce MPA and to improve its productivity through the batch fermentation process. Cheese is a favorable substrate for the growth of various species of Penicillium because of its favorable preservation conditions for fungal growth, such as low temperature and moisture content. Previous studies reported the distribution of Penicillium species in a wide range of refrigerated cheeses [17]. Although it seems to be no record of the appearance of harmful effects in humans following the consumption of fermented blue cheese, scientific research has increased attention on the production of some secondary metabolites by Penicillium species isolated from these cheeses. A known metabolite of Penicillium connected with blue cheeses is mycophenolic acid (MPA) [18, 19]. Therefore, it was used as a source for the isolation of a new MPA-producing species belonging to the Penicillium genus.", "The molecular basis of MPA biosynthesis was recently investigated in both P. brevicompactum and P. roqueforti [6, 20\u201322]. The MPA gene cluster in P. brevicompactum consists of 8 open reading frames (mpaA, mpaB, mpaC, mpaD, mpaE, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH), which encode a putative prenyltransferase, a protein with unknown function, a polyketide synthase, a natural fusion of a cytochrome P450 domain, a hydrolase domain, an inosine-5\u00b4-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an O-methyltransferase, and an oxidative cleavage enzyme, respectively [6, 20, 21]. The mpaC is responsible for the first step in MPA biosynthesis through the production of 5-methylorsellinic acid (5-MOA, which is encoded by polyketide synthase) [6]. Moreover, it was recently illustrated that the mpaF gene encodes an MPA-insensitive inosine-5\u00b4-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which confers self-resistance toward MPA [20, 23]. The investigation of the molecular basis of MPA production in producer fungal species has a significant impact on facilitating the understanding of the mechanism of its production and controlling how it can be improved, especially when the producer species is the first record. The gene cluster of bioactive metabolites typically consists of the genes that confer the needed toleration on the compounds. MPA is an inhibitor of IMPDH, which is responsible for the conversion of IMP to XMP in the novel pathway of GMP biosynthesis [24]. This reaction is important for all living microorganisms. Inosine-5\u2019-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) genes are highly conserved among various species of microorganisms.", "P. arizonense is a strong producer of various secondary metabolites and different proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Large numbers of secondary metabolites, such as tryptoquivalines, pyripyropenes, austalides, fumagillin, pseurotin A, xanthoepocin, and curvulinic acid, were investigated in the cell extract of P. arizonense [3]. Genome sequencing analysis of P. arizonense was assembled into 33.7\u00a0Mb containing 12,502 predicted genes [3]. Between these genes, 62 putative biosynthetic gene clusters are involved in lipid metabolism and secondary metabolite production. Up till now, there have been several incompletely annotated open reading frames (ORFs) in the P. arizonense genome. For these reasons, we aimed to overproduce MPA by a novel producer species of Penicillium, namely, P. arizonense, and to study the expression of the MPA-producing genes through identification and cloning of the synthesizing genes of P. arizonense that are orthologous to the MPA biosynthesizing gene cluster in P. brevicompactum. We also focused on studying the gene expression of the identified genes in combination with a physiological analysis of MPA production. There is no previous study on the phenotypic and genotypic analysis of MPA production by P. arizonense."]
