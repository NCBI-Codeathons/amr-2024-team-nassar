["1. Introduction", "B. subtilis, a type of Gram-positive bacterium, has been used as a cell factory for many enzymes, including proteases, amylases, and lipases [1,2,3]. Some subspecies produce antifungal lipopeptides (surfactin, iturin, and fengycin) that are widely applied for the control of plant pathogenic fungi in agriculture. B. subtilis ZK, a wild-type B. subtilis with high economic value, has been a workhorse for producing iturin A at a high level [4]. In order to study the high yield mechanism and further improve the iturin A production, it is desirable to perform molecular genetics studies in B. subtilis ZK. However, the fact that the genetic manipulation systems of B. subtilis ZK, such as the transformation system, gene deletion and mutation library, have not been established retards molecular genetic studies of this organism. The present work aimed at developing an efficient transformation method for the B. subtilis ZK in order to carry out molecular genetics studies.", "There are five transformation systems available that have been developed to introduce exogenous DNA into B. subtilis, such as phage transduction [5], protoplast [6], natural transformation [7], recombinant method [8], and electroporation [9]. The first two methods are important methods for introducing DNA into Bacillus [10]. Unfortunately, these two methods have not been wildly used mainly due to heavy workload and time-consuming experimental processes [11]. Natural transformation and recombinant methods are usually used for introducing DNA into B. subtilis and lead to high transformation efficiency for some B. subtilis [7,8]. However, the transformation efficiency of these two methods is closely related to some genes, such as quorum sensing components, and competence master regulator comK. The divergent structures of those genes lead to a huge difference in the transformation efficiency [12,13]. Hence, the natural transformation and recombinant method are strain-specific. In contrast to other methods, electroporation is a common, time-saving transformation method and has been widely used for Bacillus [9,10,11,14,15]. Although the electroporation system for B. subtilis has been developed for many years, there is still no standard and universal protocol for all B. subtilis. We carried out an efficient protocol according to the reported literature [9]. Unfortunately, relatively low efficiency was obtained (about 1.0 \u00d7 103 transformants/\u03bcg DNA) in wild-type B. subtilis ZK and the knockout of a gene was not to be performed, because the electroporation efficiency (1.0 \u00d7 103 transformants/\u03bcg DNA) was insufficient and the frequency of a foreign plasmid integrating into genome was about 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20131.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 per plasmid when the homologous region was less than 1 kb [16,17,18,19].", "Many factors affect electroporation efficiency including growth medium [11], growth phase [14], electric field [20], weakening agent [21], plasmid quantity [22], plasmid desalting [23], electroporation buffer [20], and heat treatment [24]. Some factors have combined effects on electroporation efficiency [19,25]. Hence, it is desirable to apply the multifactorial experimental design to investigate the combined effects of the conditions in order to improve electroporation efficiency. Response surface methodology (RSM) is a type of simple, commonly used multifactorial experimental design methodology used for the optimization of a small number of factors. It not only reflects the combined effects of the studied factors, but also allows completion of the optimization through a small number of experiments. To date, RSM design has been widely applied for the optimization of production conditions and media in industrial formulations [26,27] and has been rarely used to optimize electroporation conditions.", "In the present study, the effects of seven factors on electroporation were investigated, including the growth media, growth phase, electric field, concentration of weakening agent, electroporation buffer, plasmid quantity, as well as heat treatment. In addition, RSM design was applied to investigate the combined effects of wall-weakening agents on the electroporation efficiency. We ultimately developed an efficient electroporation method for B. subtilis ZK that yielded a high efficiency (1.03 \u00d7 107 transformants/\u03bcg of DNA), which would enable the construction of a large mutant library or the knockout of a gene in wild-type B. subtilis ZK. In order to validate the electroporation efficiency, a gene (rapC) was successfully inactivated using the suicide plasmid pMUTIN4 with the established electroporation method."]
