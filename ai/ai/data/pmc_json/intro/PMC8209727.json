["Introduction", "Escherichia coli\n is not only a commensal resident of the human and animal gut, but also a pathogen responsible for intestinal or extra-intestinal infections. \nE. coli\n is characterized by a high genetic and phenotypic diversity, with a population distributed into at least eight major phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F and G) [1]. \nE. coli\n strains from phylogroup B2 are increasingly being found in the faeces of healthy humans in high-income countries and also responsible for extra-intestinal diseases, including urinary tract infections, sepsis, pneumonia and neonatal meningitis [2]. By enabling the exchange of genetic material between bacterial cells, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a major driving force in the evolution of bacteria, including adaptation to their host and expansion of their ecological niche [3]. HGT-mediated acquisition of large genomic islands (GIs) or pathogenicity islands (PAIs) is recognized as a major contributor to the emergence of the various \nE. coli\n pathotypes [4]. The E. coli pks pathogenicity island consists of a clbA-clbS gene cluster enabling the biosynthesis of a polyketide (PK) \u2013 non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) hybrid genotoxin known as colibactin [5]. This island exhibits typical features of horizontally acquired genomic elements: (i) it is a large (i.e. 54\u2009kb) region with a distinct GC content compared to that of the chromosomal backbone, (ii) it is physically associated with a phage-type integrase gene that probably mediated its insertion into the chromosome and (iii) it is located at a tRNA locus and is flanked by two short (i.e. 17\u2009bp) direct repeats (DRs) reminiscent of those generated upon integrase-mediated insertion of mobile genetic elements [5, 6]. The pks island can be found in other members of the \nEnterobacteriaceae\n such as \nKlebsiella pneumoniae\n, \nCitrobacter koseri\n and \nEnterobacter aerogenes\n [6], and in the honeybee gut commensal \nFrischella perrara\n [7] and the marine sponge commensal \nPseudovibrio\n sp. [8].", "Colibactin is a virulence factor for extra-intestinal pathogenic \nE. coli\n (ExPEC) [9\u201311] and is also a suspected procarcinogenic factor [12\u201314]. Colibactin induces DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) [15] and double-strand breaks [5] in host eukaryotic cells. Its production involves the sequential action of the Clb proteins, including PK synthases (PKSs), NRP synthetases (NRPSs), hybrid PKS-NRPS, and accessory, editing and maturation enzymes [16]. Colibactin was first synthetized as a prodrug called precolibactin, carrying an N-myristoyl-d-asparagine (C14-Asn) side chain that is then cleaved in the periplasm to release the active genotoxin, whose translocation across the bacterial outer membrane remains unknown [17]. The production of colibactin is positively regulated by ClbR [18]. The multi-modular PKS-NRPS assembly line not only produces colibactin but also a set of numerous secondary metabolites with varying modes of action [19, 20]. These include analgesic lipopeptides, such as C12-Asn-GABA, with the ability to diffuse across the epithelial barrier and act on sensory neurons to decrease visceral pain in the host [21]. The pks island also contributes to the production of siderophores (enterobactin, salmochelin and yersiniabactin), via its promiscuous phosphopantetheinyl transferase ClbA [10], and siderophore-microcins via its ClbP peptidase [22].", "To date, the presence of the pks island has been investigated mostly in \nE. coli\n strains isolated from humans with extra-intestinal infections [5, 6, 23, 24]. Here we explored the distribution, conservation and functionality of the pks island in a large collection of non-clinical \nE. coli\n strains originating from human and bovine hosts [25]. We found that the pks island was not only present in phylogroup B2 but also in other genetic phylogroups. We identified different scenarios for its integration into the \nE. coli\n genome. The sequence of the pks island is highly conserved and pks-positive strains were overwhelmingly capable of producing colibactin, suggesting that the pks island is under selective pressure for the adaptation of \nE. coli\n to various ecological niches, through the production of colibactin or other metabolites or pks-encoded enzymatic activities."]
