["1. Introduction", "The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens is alarming [1]. Consequently, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was put on the top ten list of global public health threats facing humanity. As the ordinary treatments with the available antibiotics are ineffective, finding and developing new agents to combat infections caused by bacterial pathogens has become an urgent necessity. Many of the antibiotics which are currently applied in human and veterinary medicine were originally isolated from actinomycetes (bacterial strains of the order Actinomycetales) [2]. Thus, actinomycetes are an excellent source of antibiotics and other bioactive secondary metabolites. In most cases, the genes encoding the proteins for the production, resistance, transport, etc. of the secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, cluster in the genome (biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)). Based on the knowledge obtained from the validated BGCs and the corresponding sequences of protein family domains (Pfams), databases\u2014and subsequently, bioinformatics tools\u2014were established for the mining of the microbial genomes. Such tools make the in silico identification of BGCs possible. A single actinomycete-genome contains more than twenty BGCs. As the output of a cluster analysis usually provides the users with an overview on the hits and their similarity to characterized BGCs, it allows the exclusion of known BGCs, prioritization and/or the selection of potential new BGCs that might deliver a novel compound. In addition to the genome miming tools, traditional methods including strain cultivation, the direct screening of culture supernatants or extracts for biological activity, and finally, compound isolation, which is required for any of the downstream steps of the drug development, are applied in the field. While diverse genome mining tools were described in other reviews [3,4,5,6,7,8], in this article, we emphasize the bioactivity-based screening methods.", "In the first part, we present assays that rely on the diffusion principle and growth inhibition of indicator strains (test strains). The most popular are relatively simple agar diffusion assays and thin-layer chromatography (TLC)\u2013bioautographies. Agar diffusion assays play an important role in diagnostics where they are applied for antimicrobial susceptibility testing with pure substances to identify the appropriate antibiotics for a more targeted treatment. In the drug discovery field, they are particularly useful for the primary screenings of materials from natural producers such as actinomycetes (e.g., culture supernatants, extracts). The primary screenings are usually followed by secondary, more specific screenings that enable the further characterization of the compound. An important part of it is the elucidation of the mode of action. Therefore, diverse target-based assays are utilized, which we describe in the second part of this review. As complex, non-purified samples contain a mixture of metabolites which might interfere with the applied system and lead to unreliable results (e.g., off-target effects), the isolation or at least an enrichment of the active compounds is necessary. The available technologies nowadays make the purification easier [9,10,11,12,13]. In many cases, it is possible to obtain the required quantities and quality for studying the mechanism of action (MOA) and other features of the compound.", "In the following sections, we introduce the reader into both diffusion- and target-based screening methods. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of the presented assays and give advice for the optimization of some of the procedures."]
