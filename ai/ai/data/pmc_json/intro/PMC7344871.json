["1. Introduction", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterial species ubiquitous in the environment and associated with different types of infections in the hospital. Resistance to antibiotics is at the origin of the emergence of clones that are widely distributed worldwide and are responsible for nosocomial infections [1,2]. Interestingly, long-term infections in cystic fibrosis or burn patients are not systematically related to multidrug resistance but, rather, to the capacity of the strains to evolve and hide in biofilms [3,4]. The wide genetic diversity of the species is favored by the plasticity of the genome mediated by mobile genetic elements (MGE) including integrative conjugative elements (ICE), genomic islands (GI), and insertion sequences (IS) which are segments of DNA acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [5,6]. Prophages constitute another class of mobile elements. It has been estimated that, in addition to a highly conserved core genome, strains possess specific sequences that can account for 10 to 20% of their genome and therefore are considered as \u201caccessory\u201d [7,8,9,10]. The accessory genome is subject to rapid change in response to selective pressure [11] and plays an important role in antibiotic resistance [12,13]. Regions of Genome Plasticity (RGP) were defined by Mathee et al. as strain-specific regions made of at least four open reading frames (ORFs): firstly RGP01 to RGP62 [11], extended to RGP94 in additional studies (RGP63 to RGP80 [14], RGP81 to RGP89 [15] and RGP90 to RGP94 [16]). New RGPs are continuously discovered in newly sequenced genomes. A large number of RGPs are immediately adjacent to tRNA or tmRNA genes known to act as integration sites for plasmids, phages and genomic islands [5,7,15,17,18]. Prophages and ICE carrying antibiotic resistant genes, metabolic and virulence factors represent a significant part of the accessory genome in P. aeruginosa [13,19]. Some phages contribute to the pathogenicity of their host either by carrying virulence factors or by modifying chromosomal gene expression [20,21]. They also provide resistance to other phages through different mechanisms, including the role of moron genes [22,23].", "The continuous coevolution of bacteria and phages leads to the existence of strains with very diverse susceptibly reflecting different evolutionary histories [24]. Phages are exerting a strong pressure on their host, which may result in the selection of a variety of mutations, including deletions of large genomic regions allowing the bacteria to resist infection [25,26,27]. Bacteria have developed multiple ways to resist phages [28,29,30]; however, mutations in receptors are the most frequently observed events in laboratory-derived phage-resistant mutants [31]. Whereas temperate phages usually show a restricted host range and affinity for specific receptors, virulent phages of Gram-negative bacteria often require the presence of common structures, principally type IV pili (T4P), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or O-antigen, for binding to their host. The interactions between the phage tail fiber and the receptor are specific to a given strain. Nonspecific innate immunity is provided by restriction-modification (R-M) systems, toxin-antitoxins and abortive systems. The adaptive immune system constituted by Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic (CRISPR) elements and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes is unique in that it stores a memory of invasive DNA in the form of short sequences called spacers [32]. In P. aeruginosa, about 30% of strains were shown to possess a type I-F CRISPR-Cas system, whereas 6% also possessed a type I-E system [33,34,35]. Some P. aeruginosa strains also carry a third CRISPR subtype (type I-C) [35]. Interestingly, the majority of spacers for which the origin is known correspond to temperate phages, plasmids or transferable ICEs [35].", "We previously reported that 10% of P. aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients were resistant to bacteriophages belonging to seven different genera [34]. A similar observation was made using a panel of strains representing the diversity across P. aeruginosa and eight lytic phages belonging to four genera [36]. By comparison to the resistance to antibiotics, such strains can be referred to as \u201cmultiphage-resistant or MPhR\u201d. Conversely, some strains isolated from similar environments showed a high susceptibility to phages, such as reference strain PAO1 [37,38] or strain PcyII-10 [27]. A multiphage infection of PAO1 in vitro led to the emergence of resistant variants with reduced fitness and deficiency in T4P and LPS expressions [38,39]. It is believed that the fitness cost of such resistant bacteria would be so high in a natural environment that they would not persist [40]. While a loss of receptors present on the appendages necessary for motility such as pili and flagella, outer membrane proteins or LPS will decrease virulence and the capacity to survive [41], mucoid variants or variants secreting higher levels of virulent factors will be more aggressive [38,42,43]. There is still much to learn about the fate of phage-resistant bacteria in patients and in the environment and, particularly, in biofilms [44,45]. This will be of importance when considering phage therapy [46,47].", "We describe here the characteristics and genome sequences of three clinical MPhR strains and compare them to PcyII-10, a highly susceptible strain [27]. The phage-resistant strains have accumulated mobile genetic elements predicted to provide selective advantages and further increase their capacity to survive treatments using antibiotics or phages."]
