["Introduction", "Globally, the ever-growing population has put the life of humankind on the edge of being targeted by various diseases, among which, diabetes and antibiotic-resistance infectious diseases are the most common.1 Over the past decades, the global incidence rate of the disease has risen at an alarming rate, hence making it a major health problem of the 21st century.2\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic and epidemic disease characterized by constant hyperglycemia. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that over 4.22 billion people around the globe have been affected by diabetes and this number is predicted to be about 6.42 billion, by 2040.3 There are two types of DM; type 1 DM results from damage of \u03b2-cells of the pancreas so that insulin cannot be synthesized adequately, and type 2 DM results from insufficiency of insulin action or resistance. It is interesting to note that people with uncontrolled DM (regardless of type) have changes in healing latency and a higher risk of contracting several newly emerging infectious (mostly bacterial) infections. Due to the immune system\u2019s inability to successfully defend against invasive microorganisms, infections are a major problem in diabetics.4 Bacterial infections and diabetes can have a mutually reinforcing relationship, with some infections, such as periodontitis exacerbating insulin resistance. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant problem in diabetes patients as a result of their susceptibility to infection as well as their frequent use of antibiotics to treat illnesses. Bacteria can develop resistance by changing target sites, making specialized efflux pumps, mutating their DNA to create new metabolic pathways, or creating \u03b2 -lactamases, an enzyme that breaks down \u03b2 -lactams.5 As reported by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2015, T2DM comprises approximately 90\u201395% of all cases of diabetes.6 One solution to mitigate diabetes, especially type 2 DM, is the regulation of postprandial blood glucose by inhibiting the main carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes of \u03b1-glucosidase/amylase in the intestine.7 Currently, prescribed acarbose as both sugar mimics oral \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibitors remain in parallel with voglibose, and miglitol the most common drugs of T2DM; however, their application is hindered by the side effects. Moreover, the associated disadvantages required tedious multi-steps for preparation, and low natural abundance prompted the exploration of new molecules as inhibitors for the targeted enzyme.8,9 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) decrease insulin levels in hyperglycemia, which in turn regulates gene transcription and ultimately results in death. ROS is produced under a hyperglycemic condition which further implicates various disorders important to the development of diabetic complications. ROS are thought to damage cells by forming free radicals and lipid peroxides in cell membranes.10,11 Antioxidants that scavenge ROS are of great value in preventing the development and spread of oxidative diseases.12 They play an important role in protecting against deadly diseases by turning free radicals into ineffective states.13 Thus, the use of antioxidants in combination with an anti-diabetic and antibiotic drug will greatly help the immune system to combat insulin and bacterial resistance, respectively.6,14", "Currently, lead compounds derived from natural products are emerging as biotherapeutic sources for drug discovery and development.15,16 Curcumin, is a polyphenolic substance obtained from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa L, displaying a wide spectrum of biological activities.17,18 The pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the \u03b2-diketone functionality of curcumin is a substrate for liver aldo keto reductase, which may be one of the reasons for its rapid metabolism in vivo.19 Due to an unstable \u03b2-diketone moiety in the curcumin structure, its poor stability, low bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic limitations have hindered the therapeutic efficacy and largely contributed to curcumin instability under physiological conditions.20,21 To overcome such limitations, several approaches have been explored and the replacement of central \u03b2-diketo functionality with mono carbonyl has resulted in many compounds with improving pharmacokinetic properties and bioavailability of curcumin while increasing its biological activities.22 Monocarbonyl curcuminoids\u2019 bioactive representations exhibit fascinating biological activities that are superior to curcumin itself and are chemically more stable than curcumin in vitro.23 Studies have identified the diketo moiety as the cause of curcumins\u2019 instability and it has been hypothesized that adding a heterocyclic ring structure to the heart of the curcumin scaffold would increase the molecule\u2019s stability as well as its activity by a wide margin.24,25 Curcuminoids incorporated with a heterocyclic structure at the diketo site tend to have reduced rotational freedom, absence of tautomerism, and minimized metal chelation properties.26 In continuation of our efforts in finding antidiabetic, antibacterial, and antioxidant drug candidates, this work focused on the preparation of nitrogen-containing compounds of N-pyrazoline, pyrimidine-2-ol, thiazolo[3,2-\u03b1] pyrimidine, and \u03b2-substituted imidazole analogs through heterocyclization of suitably functionalized substrates of curcumin derivatives. On the other hand, over the years, eco-friendly ultrasonic irradiation approaches have been established for the synthesis of various heterocycles with spectacular results, such as reduced environmental pollution, low cost, high yields with short reaction times, experimental simplicity, enhanced selectivity, energy saving and ease of processing and handling.27,28 These desirable qualities have established the advantages of sonication over conventional heating.", "In light of the aforementioned facts, we hereby report the synthesis of a new series of heterocyclics derived from curcumin scaffolds by following a greener route of ultrasonic irradiation. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antihyperglycemic activity through \u03b1-amylase inhibition as well as their antioxidant and antibacterial potentials, with the final attempt of obtaining improved efficiency, reduced side effects, and relatively low-cost agents. Furthermore, the in silico ADMET prediction and molecular docking studies were investigated to explore their potential to become clinical drugs."]
