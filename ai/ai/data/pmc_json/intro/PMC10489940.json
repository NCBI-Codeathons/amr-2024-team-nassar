["1. Introduction", "Medicinal herbs contain important molecules with therapeutic potential [1], and some of them have been used as components in Chinese medicine. Because the focus of Chinese medicine is not just on illness, but also on the patient as an individual, some medicinal herbs have been used widely, not only in Asian countries, but also in the United States of America (USA) and Europe [2,3]. In general, the biologically active substances synthesized in plants are stored as glycoside forms of aglycones to improve their stability and water solubility; however, the biological activity of glycosides is quite a bit lower, due to their low bioavailability compared with that of corresponding aglycones [4]. After ingestion, aglycones have been reported to be generally released from glycosyl residues by gut microbiota [5,6]. The plant-derived substances also undergo biotransformation by the gut microbiota, such as deglycosylation, dehydroxylation, reduction, C-ring cleavage, and demethylation [7], suggesting that the microorganisms play a significant role in displaying the maximum effect of medicinal herbs by conversion of the substances through fermentation. Thus, the application of the fermented medicinal herbal extract is an attractive approach to improve the efficacy of those herbal medicines.", "Recently, gut microbiota have been reported to be associated with human health and diseases [8,9], such as obesity [10], liver diseases [11], and neuropsychiatric diseases [12]. Those reports indicate that dysbiosis, which is regarded as a disturbance of gut microbial homeostasis, may be responsible for multiple disorders [13,14]. Our previous study showed that the administration of live LAB cells can restore not only the fluctuations in the cecal microbiota and metabolites related to putrefaction, but also alcohol poisoning symptoms in the ethanol-fed-mouse model [15]. In that model, the abundance of a putative order RF32, which has been reported to positively correlate with the serum trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) level [16], was remarkably increased. Dietary substrates, including choline, carnitine, and betaine, are partially used by gut microorganisms to form trimethylamine (TMA), which is subsequently enzyme-converted to TMAO in the liver [17,18]. TMAO has been increasingly recognized as a risk marker of cardiometabolic and hepatic diseases, as well as other chronic diseases [19,20]; therefore, suppressing microbial TMA production by the alteration of disturbed gut microbiota seems to be an ideal preventive approach against those diseases.", "Although our previous studies have shown that biologically active aglycones are released from their corresponding glycosides, and some bioactive substances are newly generated in medicinal herbal extracts fermented with plant-derived lactic acid bacteria (LABs) [21], their efficacy in modulating gut microbiota has not been dealt with yet. Therefore, in the present study, we have focused on whether the dysbiosis will be repaired by the application of the fermented medicinal herbal extract, using the level of TMA production as an indicator."]
