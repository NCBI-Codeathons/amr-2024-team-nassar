["Introduction", "Xenorhabdus nematophila, a well-studied genus of entomopathogenic bacteria, lives in symbiosis with Steinernema nematodes. Previous research has revealed that X. nematophila is a potent producer of natural compounds with versatile biological activities including antifungal, antibacterial, and antimalarial activities (Crawford et al., 2012; Challinor and Bode, 2015; Engel et al., 2017; Dreyer et al., 2018). Many of these metabolites belong to peptides such as xenocoumacins, nematophin, xenorhabdins, rhabduscins, and xenorxides (Li et al., 1997a,b; Ji et al., 2004; B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9nyi et al., 2009; Helge, 2011; Yang et al., 2011). Such peptides are of diverse structures and resultant multiple bioactivities including antimicrobial activity against plant pathogens (Li et al., 1997a; Yang et al., 2011; Dreyer et al., 2018). Besides, whole genome programs have shown that approximately 7.5% of genomic genes encode proteins involving the secondary metabolism biosynthesis in the strain X. nematophila ATCC19061, most of which encoded molecules are cryptic (Chaston et al., 2011). Given that the culture supernatants of many Xenorhabdus species exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against many plant pathogens (Fang et al., 2014; Hazir et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2016), it is feasible to discover novel secondary metabolites of antifungal activity from X. nematophila as bio-pesticides for agricultural production.", "Plant diseases caused by fungi are destructive attacks on crop production, generating enormous economic losses worldwide. Rhizoctonia solani is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that infects more than 200 plant species worldwide, resulting in severe losses in crop yield (Lewis and Lumsden, 2001; Zheng et al., 2013; Mayo et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016). It can also produce sclerotia, a special resting structure surviving in soil for many years, which is the main source of infection in the disease cycle (Townsend and Willetts, 1954; Feng et al., 2016; Moni et al., 2016). Currently, the most common strategy for disease management is the application of chemical fungicides. Their overuse, however, has posed serious threats to human health, environmental safety and ecological balance (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016; Rohr et al., 2017). Bio-pesticides are effective alternatives to the chemical fungicides to overcome their adverse impacts (Kumar, 2018; Lengai and Muthomi, 2018). Moreover, searching for bioactive compounds from microbes for control of the difficult-to-control plant pathogens is becoming a promising lead in the development of novel antimicrobial agents for agriculture production (Kim and Hwang, 2007; Mnif and Ghribi, 2015; Kanagaraj Muthu-Pandian et al., 2018).", "Previous studies revealed that the cell-free culture of X. nematophila YL001 exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some plant pathogens in vitro and in vivo, including P. infestans and B. cinerea (Guo et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018). However, no purified bioactive compounds were obtained from this bacterial strain, although many metabolites of novel structures and strong antimicrobial activity were purified and identified from strains of genus Xenorhabdus (Dreyer et al., 2018) including odilorhabdins (Pantel et al., 2018), cabanillasin (Houard et al., 2013), and bicornutin-A (B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9nyi et al., 2009). These studies mainly focused on their medical applications as antimicrobial agents. Currently, there is still limited information available about the antimicrobial potency of the metabolites of X. nematophila against phytopathogens (Li et al., 1997a; Ji et al., 2004; Lang et al., 2008; Gualtieri et al., 2009; Dreyer et al., 2018), especially the in vivo antimicrobial data (Yang et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2016). In this paper, we tried to isolate and identify metabolites of antimicrobial potency against agricultural pathogenic fungi and oomycetes from X. nematophila YL001 and determine their antimicrobial activity in vitro. Subsequently, we evaluated the in vivo control efficacy of (\u00b1)-nematophin against R. solani. The effects of nematophin on the sclerotial development of R. solani, as well as on the hyphal morphology and ultrastructure, were also observed in this paper. The results revealed that N,N\u2032-dimethyl-cyclo (L-Phe-L-Leu) possessed efficient antifungal activity against Exserohilum turcicum, and that nematophin could be used as a potential candidate for bio-pesticides."]
