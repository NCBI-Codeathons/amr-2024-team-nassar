["1. Introduction", "Pseudouridimycin (PUM) is a novel bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibitor that was discovered in Streptomyces sp. DSM26212 and characterized by Maffioli et al. in 2017 [1]. The DNA-dependent bacterial RNAP is a target for antibiotics that is of proven interest for antibiotic drug development. Known inhibitors are the rifamycins, e.g., rifampicin that is applied in treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, and AIDS-associated mycobacterial infections [2,3]; the lipiarmycins, e.g., the narrow-spectrum antibiotic fidaxomicin used for treatment of Clostridium difficile-related infections [3]; \u03b1-pyrone antibiotics, e.g., corallopyronin and myxopyronin, both currently under preclinical evaluation [4,5,6,7,8]. All these antibiotics block transcription by binding to RNAP, which results either in a steric blocking of nascent RNA chain extension after the first or second condensation step (i.e., rifamycins), by inhibition of transcription initiation through binding to the DNA template\u2013RNAP complex (i.e., lipiarmycins), or by blocking the hinge region of the RNAP (i.e., \u03b1-pyrone antibiotics). PUM in contrast competes with uracil triphosphate (UTP) for access to the active site cavity of the RNAP. Thereby, incorporation of UTP nucleotides to the growing RNA chain is blocked. This represents a novel mode of action, rendering the compound an interesting lead structure for further investigation and development.", "The biosynthetic pathway of PUM and a corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was identified and characterized by knockout (KO) experiments [9]. Furthermore, production of the pseudouridine nucleoside antibiotic strepturidin by Streptomyces albus DSM40763 was recently reinvestigated and it could be shown that strepturidin is actually PUM. However, the structural assignment in the initial report was found to be not correct [10]. Genetic analysis of S. albus DSM40763 also revealed the presence of the PUM BGC in this strain [10]. For manufacture of PUM, nine catalytic steps were proposed [9]. Thereby, in a first step, uridine nucleotides are converted to pseudouridine nucleotides and subsequently become dephosphorylated by the catalytic action of the pseudouridine synthase PumJ and the phosphatase PumD to yield free pseudouridine (PU). Via intermediate creation of 5\u2032-oxo-PU and subsequent transamination, 5\u2032-amino-PU (APU) is formed by PumI, catalyzing oxidation of the 5\u2032 hydroxyl group to a keto group, and PumG, catalyzing transamination at the 5\u2032 position with asparagine as NH3 donor. Then, APU is linked to glutamine by PumK, yielding Gln-APU. In parallel, glycine is converted to guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) by transguanylation (PumN catalyzed), which is subsequently fused to Gln-APU by PumM, resulting in formation of deoxy-PUM. The final biosynthetic step is hydroxylation of the peptide bond/amidic nitrogen between Gln and GAA by PumE. The identified BGC consists of 15 genes (pumA-pumO). For seven of these genes (i.e., pumE, G, I, J, K, M, and N), a function could be assigned by experimental data. For five genes (i.e., pumB, C, D, H, and L), a function was proposed based on sequence homology. Hence, each of the nine proposed steps was at least in silico matched with a corresponding enzyme from the PUM BGC [9]. The gene pumH that is situated within the BGC was proposed to function as an adenylate kinase, based on sequence homology. However, no biosynthetic step could be readily assigned, since it could not be matched to one of the proposed biosynthetic steps in PUM biosynthesis [9]. Deleting the gene from the WT producer strain resulted in a significant drop in production but not in a complete abolition of PUM production. Additionally, one regulator and two transporter genes (i.e., pumB, pumL) could be readily identified based on homology. In the first reports, no function was assigned to the genes pumA, pumF and pumO in PUM biosynthesis. However, the pumF analogue mur33 is present in the muraymycin C1 BGC, the latter an uridine nucleoside itself.", "Here, the heterologous expression of the PUM BGC in the commonly used surrogate host Streptomyces coelicolor M1146 is described. Therefore, the BGC was streamlined (i.e., all genes proposed to be essential for the biosynthesis were cloned facing in the same direction and were set under the control of one promoter) and several constructs were generated to identify the minimal BGC necessary for heterologous production of the nucleoside antibiotic. Only the construct harboring, in addition to the described nine biosynthetic steps, the genes pumH and pumF, the latter showing sequence similarities to genes encoding for a serine/threonine protein kinase, resulted in reliable PUM biosynthesis in the heterologous host applied. Thereby, evidence is presented that the enzyme PumF is essential for PUM biosynthesis by regulating enzymatic activity in the biosynthetic pathway."]
