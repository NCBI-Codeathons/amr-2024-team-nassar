["Introduction", "Pseudomonas putida are ubiquitous bacteria frequently present in water, in soils, and especially in the plant rhizosphere (Timmis 2002; Dos Santos et al. 2004). These aerobic, gram-negative Pseudomonads possess many traits that make them well suited as biocontrol and growth promoting agents (Weller 1988; Lemanceau 1992; Weller et al. 2002; Fravel 2005). A large number of secondary metabolites (Leisinger and Margraff 1979), growth hormones (Brown 1972), antibiotics (Fravel 1988, 2005; Weller et al. 2002) and chelating compounds such as siderophores (Leong 1986) are known to be released by these fluorescent Pseudomonads. Some of them may also be involved in the biodegradation of natural or man-made toxic chemical compounds (Holloway 1992; Ramos et al. 2009). P. putida show diverse spectrum of metabolic versatility and niche-specific adaptations (Rojo 2010; Wu et al. 2011).", "There may be direct or indirect mechanisms of these rhizobacteria as plant growth promoters and biological control agents. Phosphate solubilization is one of the direct mechanisms (Rodr\u00edguez and Fraga 1999; Mayak et al. 2004; Shahzad et al. 2010) and production of antibiotics such as 2,4-diacetyl phloroglucinol (DAPG), phenazine, pyoluteorin and pyrrolnitrin against pathogenic fungi and bacteria is among indirect mechanisms of PGPR (Ramamoorthy et al. 2001; McSpadden Gardener B 2008). Apart from primary and secondary metabolite production, certain fluorescent Pseudomonads (especially P. putida) are suitable as whole-cell biocatalyzers for the production of several value-added industrial compounds such as biodegradable and biocompatible polyesters called polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) or polyhydroxybutyrates (PHB). It accumulates as discrete granules and is used as storage material for carbon and for reducing equivalents by P. putida. This property has been widely exploited for their targeted biosynthesis in this organism (Hoffmann and Rehm 2004). Different strains of P. putida such as P. putida KT2440, P. putida GPo1, P. putida S12, etc. have been investigated for its capacity to accumulate PHAs and PHBs from different carbon sources (Durner et al. 2001; Hartmann et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2007; Meijnen et al. 2008). The pha gene cluster is responsible for the accumulation of PHAs and PHBs in P. putida (Chung et al. 2009; Vo et al. 2008; Wang and Nomura 2010).", "PCR ribotyping has been used to characterize Pseudomonas spp. which concentrate on the analysis of the segments of the ribosomal genes and discriminate between isolates of same species by use of their chromosomal differences. The three main sets of repetitive elements used for typing purposes are the repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequence, the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence (ERIC) and the BOX elements. Additionally, the availability of antibiotic gene sequences has enabled design of primers based on conserved regions for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of antibiotic-producing bacteria (Raffel et al. 1996; Raaijmakers et al. 1997; Bangera and Thomashow 1999; McSpadden Gardener et al. 2001; de Souza and Raaijmakers 2003).", "Multidisciplinary application of fluorescent Pseudomonads makes it significant and essential to study their phenotypic diversity along with genotypic variability. This will be helpful in designing strategies to use the indigenous isolates as bio-inoculants for biocontrol as well as plant growth promotion. This offers a viable substitute for the use of chemical inputs in agriculture. However, an effective biological control strain isolated from one region may not perform effectively in other soils or plants. Therefore, in an attempt to study the diversity of indigenous fluorescent Pseudomonads in Chhattisgarh, a large number of fluorescent Pseudomonads were isolated from the forest and agricultural soils, characterized and maintained in the Department of Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, Raipur. The purpose of present investigation was to assess the representative P. putida isolates for their polyhydroxybutyrate production and phosphate solubilizing ability using an array of in vitro assays; metabolite utilization tests and genotypic profiling were performed with species-specific ERIC primers and some antibiotic gene-specific primers. Species-specific primer was used for taxonomic affiliation of P. putida. The overall aim of the present investigation was thus to exploit and have a better understanding of beneficial activities of P. putida isolates."]
