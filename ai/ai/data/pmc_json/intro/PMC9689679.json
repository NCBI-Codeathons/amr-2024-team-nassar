["1. Introduction", "Glycopeptide antibiotics\u2014more precisely, dalbaheptides\u2014represent a large group of natural products produced by soil-dwelling, high-G-C-content, and Gram-positive actinomycetes [1,2]. Dalbaheptides are products of sophisticated biosynthetic machinery involving the non-ribosomal synthesis of the heptapeptide aglycone, followed by numerous and variable modifications. Genes encoding these pathways are co-localized, co-expressed, and organized in large biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Dalbaheptide biosynthesis has been extensively studied and reviewed in recent years [3,4,5,6,7,8,9].", "Although biosynthetic and regulatory mechanisms behind the production of dalbaheptides are interesting per se and represent a valuable model for studying other natural products, the real importance of dalbaheptides comes from their clinical relevance [10,11,12,13]. Today, two natural (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and three semi-synthetic (dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin) dalbaheptides are used to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens [8]. As potent inhibitors of Gram-positive cell-wall biosynthesis, dalbaheptides strongly and selectively bind lipid II [14], essential for the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall [15]. They specifically interact with the d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) termini of the lipid II pentapeptide side stems by forming five defined hydrogen bonds, thus impeding the following transpeptidation and transglycosylation steps [9,16,17].", "As Gram-positive bacteria, actinobacterial dalbaheptide producers require the expression of self-resistance mechanisms to avoid suicide during antibiotic biosynthesis and excretion. Resistance mechanisms in model dalbaheptide producers have been investigated in detail in recent years [18,19,20,21]. The most relevant dalbaheptide resistance mechanism involves at least five genes\u2014known as van genes (i.e., vancomycin resistance genes)\u2014commonly organized in two operons [22,23]. The first operon consists of three genes\u2014vanHAX\u2014coding for structural enzymes required for cell-wall remodeling. Here, VanH is an \u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase, transforming pyruvate to d-lactate (d-Lac); VanA is a d-Ala-d-Lac ligase, while VanX is a d,d-dipeptidase [24]. The second operon\u2014vanRS\u2014encodes a two-component regulatory system tuning vanHAX expression in response to the extracellular presence of a glycopeptide antibiotic. Dalbaheptide-producing actinobacteria carry vanHAXRS genes adjacent to or within the corresponding glycopeptide BGCs.", "Based on extensive genomic analysis, we recently reported [25] that vanHAXRS genes are also frequently present in dalbaheptide non-producing actinobacteria, indicating that there is no unique correlation between the presence of glycopeptide BGCs and van genes. However, it remains unclear why dalbaheptide non-producing actinobacteria carry vanHAXRS genes so frequently. Actinobacteria\u2014either dalbaheptide-producing or not\u2014are the most likely primary environmental reservoir of van genes, further spreading to other bacterial taxa [25,26]. The spread of van genes among opportunistic pathogens such as enterococci or staphylococci represents a hot topic of investigation due to their clinical relevance [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47]. On the other hand, the migration of vanHAXRS genes to non-harmful soil-dwelling bacteria other than Actinobacteria has not attracted much immediate attention, although they likely serve as a bridge to distribute van genes from Actinobacteria spp. to dangerous pathogens [26]. Previous reports highlighted that van genes are also present in two additional classes of Gram-positive soil bacteria, namely, the class Bacilli and the class Clostridia [48,49,50,51,52]. As reported in ESM Table S1, we analyzed in detail the precedent literature and the genomic data available on the bacterial species carrying vanHAXRS genes other than those belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum. It was observed that vanHAXRS genes were mainly found in enterococci (Enterococcus (Ecc.) fecalis and Enterococcus faecium) and Staphylococcus (Scc.) aureus strains, followed by Paenibacillus spp. and a few other species belonging to the Bacilli and Clostridia classes (for example, in Clostridioides (Cld.) difficile AI0499). In many cases, genes were found to be associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs): transposons and plasmids (ESM Table S1), which are probably involved in their interspecies migration.", "Considering the current progress in bacterial genome sequencing, in this work, we screened the vast amount of current publicly available genomic records to investigate vanHAXRS gene distribution in species other than those belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that vanHAXRS and related genes might be found in Anaerolineae [53], Erysipelotrichia [54], and Ktedonobacteria [55] classes. Additional information on van loci spread within Bacilli and Clostridia classes is also reported. Further phylogenetic analysis of Van proteins following the one published earlier on actinobacterial Van proteins [25] adds more details to the overall picture of how vanHAXRS genes spread among bacterial taxa."]
