["1. Introduction", "Tuberculosis (TB), primarily caused by the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the oldest and deadliest infectious diseases known to humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently reported that TB affected approximately 10 million people and killed roughly 1.3 million people in 2017 alone [1,2,3,4]. Although global TB-related mortality rates have steadily declined since the turn of the millennium, multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and totally drug-resistant (TDR) strains pose significant threats to this progress [1,3,5,6,7,8,9]. Consequently, there is an urgent need for discovering new therapeutics to treat TB, which will in part help to offset the diminishing utility of the antibiotics currently used to treat TB. Capuramycin-type nucleoside antibiotics, which represent one such possible new class, are natural products that were re-discovered in the early 2000s and have significant promise for drug development as anti-TB therapeutics. This review summarizes the discovery of the capuramycin-type nucleoside antibiotics; progress toward defining their biosynthetic pathway; and synthetic, semisynthetic, and biocatalytic studies aimed at generating analogs with potentially improved therapeutic value. For an in depth description of Mtb and tuberculosis, including the major challenges in drug discovery and development, we refer the reader to several excellent reviews [10,11,12,13,14] and publications cited herein."]
