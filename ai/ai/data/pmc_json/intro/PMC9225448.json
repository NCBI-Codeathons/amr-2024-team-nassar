["1. Introduction", "Oceans cover 71% of the Earth\u2019s surface and approximately 87% of the biosphere, and possess specific pH, temperature, pressure, oxygen content, light, and salinity greatly different from the land [1,2]. With the development of deep-sea exploration technology, spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and various separation techniques, marine natural products (MNPs) have attracted widespread concerns [3]. The complexity and the multidomain of the chemical structures endow many MNPs with specific bioactivity, allowing them to be the ideal candidates for new drug development. Secondary metabolites (SMs) of marine microorganisms have pharmaceutical value [4]. Marine microorganisms inhabit almost all ecological niches that are available, and those who survive in harsh conditions secrete SMs with novel chemical structures and unique physiological properties [2,5]. From 2018 to 2020, over 40 bioactive compounds derived from marine microorganisms were reported, and they were compiled in Ameen\u2019s review [4]. Notably, in 2018, brentuximab vedotin derived from cyanobacteria Symploca sp. was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) to treat Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma cancer (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/brentuximab-vedotin, accessed on 19 April 2022). However, research on the biodiversity of marine microorganisms and the bioactivity of their metabolites is still very limited, since only 0.1% of marine microorganisms have been explored or even less than 0.01% [6,7]. Furthermore, epifluorescence microscopy and rRNA sequencing for microbial community analysis have revealed that microbes that can be cultured in laboratory represent only a small fraction of the microbial community, and in most cases, are not the dominant population under natural conditions [8]. At the same time, due to the extremely low reproducibility and the small amounts of activated compounds extracted from marine microbial samples, it is difficult to obtain sufficient MNPs for the further analysis of biological activities and medicinal properties. In addition, total chemical synthesis is hard to realize economically, especially for the MNPs with complex structures [9], which also hinders the subsequent studies such as the verification and optimization of drug structures.", "Marine microorganisms aggregate and sequentially arrange the genes involved in the biosynthesis of a certain MNP as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [10,11]. Today, high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies coupled with convenient genome mining and metabolomic analysis tools allow researchers to rapidly identify BGCs in microbial genomes [12]. This technical breakthrough provides new avenues for the mining, modification, and production of MNPs. On the basis of genomics, we can subsequently use molecular techniques to biosynthesize high titers of MNPs, rather than merely using traditional separation and purification techniques to obtain small amounts of chemical compounds [13]. Genome mining is used to speculate the potential functions of the metabolites guided by BGCs [14,15]. Modern bioinformatic and genetic tools can also efficiently eliminate known metabolites from complex metabolite mixtures, increasing the rate of discovery of new products [16]. For example, the most widely used bioinformatics tool, antiSMASH [17], can provide detailed information about BGCs and output the stereochemical data about the assumptive compound and the amino acid module that builds the compound. Specifically, an open access database designed for MNPs called CMNPD (comprehensive marine natural products database) [18] has been available for researchers to determine the accurate chemical structures of MNPs and assist in calculating their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. More bioinformatics tools and databases for the genome mining of MNPs are included in Ambrosino\u2019s review [19].", "A major challenge to biosynthesize MNPs is the low expression or silence of MNP BGCs in laboratory. Researchers have developed several triggering strategies to activate cryptic BGCs. For culturable strains, the one strain many compounds (OSMAC) strategy excavates the potential of a specific microorganism to produce different natural products (NPs) by systematically varying culture parameters including medium composition, aeration rate, culture vessel, and the addition of enzyme inhibitors [20]. Moreover, screening strains with mutations in RNA polymerase or ribosomal proteins, as well as the deletion or induction of global transcriptional regulators, are genetic engineering techniques that have successfully triggered the expression of cryptic BGCs in microorganisms [11]. In addition, epigenetic regulation and chromatin-level remodeling approaches can precisely control the homologous or heterologous expression of BGCs by expressing pathway-specific activation genes or deleting pathway-specific repressor genes. Likewise, strong promoters can be added to BGCs to stimulate strains to produce specific SMs [21,22,23]. More concrete BGCs awakening strategies are summarized in Choi\u2019s review [24].", "However, these strategies are not amenable for all BGCs of MNPs. Above all, studies have shown that a large proportion of marine microorganisms are not culturable, which impedes the extraction and identification of bioactive metabolites from them. So apparently, the OSMAC strategy does not work in unculturable strains, and this strategy requires a relatively large experimental volume for strains with low production of MNPs. In addition, the supplementation of the medium with chromatin modifiers (such as histone deacetylase inhibitors) is not able to activate the cryptic BGCs in all species of fungi [25]. Furthermore, for the majority of BGCs, the external and/or internal signals that trigger their expression remain unknown. Even for the culturable marine microorganisms, they are inclined to show a small metabolic profile under the traditional conditions in laboratory. Otherwise, other strategies such as cocultivation and mixed fermentation should be considered to stimulate the production [26]. Moreover, a low metabolic rate and complex metabolic background may also lead to missed metabolites. To overcome these challenges, expressing BGCs in a heterologous host with a clear background of metabolites to obtain MNPs of high quality and quantity becomes a reliable alternative.", "The expression of BGCs cloned from uncultured species and environment samples is expected to facilitate the discovery of new products and produce valuable compounds [27,28,29]. A heterologous expression platform for marine microorganisms and marine environment samples in the engineered chassis strains provides a feasible method for the efficient production of MNPs, especially for the exploration of fungal MNPs. Fungi can produce a large number of bioactive metabolites [30], but due to the lack of mature fermentation technology and genetic manipulation tools, fungal MNPs rely heavily on a universal heterologous expression platform. The heterologous expression of terrestrial fungal NPs has made some progress, but most of the heterologous expression of MNPs is still focused on marine bacteria. The heterologous expression of MNPs has the following four advantages. First, a successful heterologous expression allows the correct DNA ligation and efficient co-work of all essential gene fragments in BGCs which indicate the biosynthesis of MNPs. Second, heterologous expression can biosynthesize MNPs from unculturable marine microorganisms and environment samples. Third, heterologous expression relies on a suitable host, reducing the burden of developing novel genetic tools for different strains. Fourth, the library of biosynthetic genes can be continuously updated and optimized, not only for heterologous expression, but also for the genetic manipulation of cloned pathways, biosynthetic studies, or gene remodeling of BGCs [10]. So far, the heterologous expression of MNPs has made several remarkable advances in expressing BGCs from marine actinomycetes [31] and cyanobacteria [32], which exhibits promising prospects for extending this strategy into more marine microorganisms. Efficient heterologous expression first requires the selection and optimization of a suitable heterologous host. Next, the selected BGCs are cloned, assembled into dedicated vectors, and then transferred to heterologous chassis strains for expression. In the end, using methods such as metabolic engineering can mass-produce specific MNPs for clinical research and therapeutic use [10,21,33]. Metagenomics shows an extraordinary potential in the heterologous expression of BGCs for MNPs (Figure 1), since this strategy directly extracts the total community DNA from marine samples without the need for the isolation or culture of microbes [34]. The combination of metagenomics and efficient bioactivity screening has become an effective method to identify novel bioactivities from inseparable marine microorganisms [6,12]. A marine metagenomic library was constructed from tidal flat sediments by Fujita et al. [27]. Through a metal-binding compound detection test, the researchers relied on the metal ion indicator chrome azurol S (CAS) for functional screening. The siderophore BGC was then cloned and vibrioferrin was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli.", "In this article, we review the research progress on the heterologous expression of MNPs. The heterologous expression of MNPs can be roughly summarized into two main steps: (1) appropriate selections of the heterologous hosts; (2) genetic manipulations for BGCs. These steps exert profound impacts on the effects of heterologous expression. It is clear that the intactness and arrangement of BGCs determine the expression at the genetic level, while the cloning of BGCs usually larger than 10 kb is not so simple. Meanwhile, the endogenous metabolic pathways of the hosts can affect the structures of MNPs, and the mechanisms are difficult to demonstrate and vary from host to host. For example, one research group cloned ber BGC, which indicated the formation of berninamycins A and B, while they finally obtained berninamycins J and K in another host, which pointed to the unknown host-dependent enzymes in the host [35]. Considering the above problems, this review focuses on these two steps, as well as advances in the heterologous expression of MNPs from marine BGCs, which can provide a reference for new MNPs exploration."]
