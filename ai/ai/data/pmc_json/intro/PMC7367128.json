["INTRODUCTION", "DNA damage arising from a variety of endogenous and environmental agents pose a significant risk to cell viability. Interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) are highly toxic DNA lesions that covalently tether the opposing strands of DNA, thereby inhibiting essential cellular processes such as DNA replication and transcription that rely on duplex unwinding (1). ICLs are produced by highly abundant endogenous metabolites and DNA repair intermediates, and by a number of environmental toxins including microbial and plant natural products (e.g.\u00a0mitomycin C and psoralens) that have therapeutic properties (2\u20136). Because of their cytotoxicity, crosslinking agents are often potent antimicrobials and many, including nitrogen mustards, are among the most widely used drugs in cancer chemotherapy (7,8).", "ICL repair involves unhooking the two strands by one of two known pathways, followed by repair of the resulting monoadduct (3,9). The primary mechanism of ICL unhooking involves incisions to one strand by Fanconi anemia (FA) or nucleotide excision repair (NER) associated endonucleases (10\u201312). The resulting gap and strand break must be further processed by translesion DNA synthesis and homologous recombination prior to repair of the monoadduct by a second round of NER. An alternative ICL repair pathway was recently discovered in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, whereby the ICL is unhooked by DNA glycosylase cleavage of one of the N-glycosidic bonds linking the modified nucleotide to the DNA backbone, generating an abasic (AP) site on one strand but leaving the backbone intact (13\u201315). DNA glycosylases typically initiate base excision repair (BER) of small monoadducts. Because their mode of lesion recognition and excision involves extruding (or flipping) a single nucleotide out of the helix, the mechanism by which they unhook ICLs tethered across strands is not understood.", "Glycosylase-mediated ICL repair in bacteria was discovered in the biosynthetic gene cluster of azinomycin B (AZB), a genotoxic non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide secondary metabolite produced by the soil-dwelling microbes Streptomyces sahachiroi and S. griseofuscus (16). Azinomycins are bifunctional DNA alkylating agents that form ICLs between N7 of purines in 5\u2032-PuNPy-3\u2032 sequences (17). AZB displays potent antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial species (7), antitumor activity at lower doses than mitomycin C (18), and initiates transcription of DNA damage response genes after treatment (19). The AZB synthesis cluster contains a novel DNA glycosylase, AlkZ, which cleaves AZB-ICLs and N7-methylguanine monoadducts in vitro to produce an AP site that can be processed by the bacterial AP endonuclease EndoIV (14,20). AlkZ expression is induced during production of AZB, and cells that express alkZ are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of AZB, even across different bacterial species (14). Thus, the AlkZ glycosylase provides self-resistance to the toxicity of these compounds in the producing organism (14,15).", "AlkZ belongs to the functionally uncharacterized HTH_42 superfamily of bacterial proteins known only for their arrangement of tandem winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) motifs commonly found in transcription factors and other DNA binding proteins (21). The crystal structure of AlkZ revealed a novel fold in which three wHTH motifs scaffold a C-shaped protein with a positively charged, concave surface that contains several residues important for DNA glycosylase activity (20) (Supplementary Figure S1). HTH_42 family proteins are widespread among antibiotic producers and human pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Clostridiumdifficile,\u00a0and Staphylococcus aureus, among others (14). Whether these proteins are bona fide AlkZ homologs that contain ICL unhooking activity is not known.", "To better understand the mechanism of glycosylase-mediated ICL repair and to determine whether glycosylase ICL repair in bacteria is limited to AZB production and resistance, we compared ICL unhooking activity of Streptomyces AlkZ and the uncharacterized E. coli homolog YcaQ for different types of ICLs. Our results indicate that YcaQ is a cationic alkylpurine DNA glycosylase with robust activity for a broad range of substrates, including nitrogen mustard ICLs, whereas Streptomyces AlkZ is specific for AZB-ICLs. Deletion of ycaQ from E. coli increased cellular sensitivity to the crosslinking agent mechlorethamine, and this phenotype was complemented by recombinant YcaQ. Furthermore, overexpression of ycaQ showed a strong sensitivity to both ICL and methylating agents that was dependent on generation of toxic intermediates in the BER pathway. Taken together, this work identifies E. coli YcaQ as an ICL repair glycosylase and implicates YcaQ-mediated BER as an alternative ICL repair pathway in E. coli."]
