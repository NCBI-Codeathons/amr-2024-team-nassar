["INTRODUCTION", "Antibiotic resistance is continually increasing and becoming a global problem (1). Considering that almost 700 000 people die yearly worldwide due to infections by multi-drug resistant bacteria, novel antibiotics are urgently needed (2). Most antibiotics as well as other therapeutics, such as antifungal, anticancer, or immune-inhibitory compounds are obtained as secondary metabolites by bacteria and fungi (3). Additionally, it is known that fungal species can produce a lot of bioactive compounds, such as proteasome inhibitors (4), herbicides (5)\u00a0and antifungals (6). However, in the latest survey of fungal genome sequences, only a small fraction of the fungal biosynthetic space, approximately 3%, was associated with compounds (7). This highlights the vast potential of fungi as a source of new bioactive compounds with novel modes of action and underlines the need to accordingly prioritize and characterize fungal genomes.", "In traditional drug discovery methods, screening of natural products and activity-based studies have played a key role. Recently, drug discovery efforts have been reinvigorated by modern bioinformatics tools and methods (8). Genome-based methods, such as genome mining, revealed silent or uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that encode bioactive compounds (9,10). Genome mining tools and databases are steadily improved, and both allow efficient, automated, and fast mining of the thousands of available bacterial and fungal genomes. FungiSMASH (11), DeepBGC fungal (12)\u00a0and TOUCAN (13) are some of the most widely accepted and used tools for fungal BGC detection. Likewise, the antiSMASH database (14), MIBiG (15), the Atlas of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (16), and the Mycocosm Database (17) store many thousands of well-known and predicted fungal BGCs encoding potential natural products. However, when Kelleher et\u00a0al. studied over 1000 fungal genomes to predict BGCs and their families, they predicted 36\u00a0399 BGCs and reported 12\u00a0067 gene cluster families (GCFs). They identified 2026 BGCs in these families, which may correspond to metabolite products (7). Considering that over 1 million fungal species were estimated (18), the major challenge now is the prioritization of the most promising BGCs encoding bioactive compounds for wet lab experiments.", "Recently, it has been observed that target-directed genome mining allows prioritizing bioactive compounds with potential as antibiotics or antifungals. This approach is based on the insight that antimicrobial producers must be resistant to their own products to avoid suicide (3). Often, these resistant genes are co-localized within the BGC. Various resistance mechanisms have been described, including one that involves modification of the target, which may be an essential protein. In this scenario, the BGC encodes a resistant variant of the target (19). This knowledge enables predicting the mode of action of a compound, even if a chemical structure is unknown, through the detection of a duplicated and resistant homolog of an essential gene within a BGC (20). Moore et\u00a0al.\u00a0screened orphan BGCs for a duplicated copy of fatty acid synthase genes that were found to be co-localized within orphan BGCs, thereby identifying a fatty-acid synthase inhibitor (21). Likewise, in the attempt to discover a novel proteasome inhibitor, Wang et\u00a0al.\u00a0searched for uncharacterized BGCs in Aspergillus nidulans and prioritized the ones containing a duplicated version of a proteasome subunit within the BGC using a target-directed approach. They eventually identified an uncharacterized and inactive BGC and managed to activate it by replacing each of its native promoters, leading to the production of the tripeptide fellutamide B (4). Another example was discovered by the Tang group (5). In their study, the researchers focused on dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD). They suggested that a fungal gene cluster that produces a DHAD inhibitor may have an extra copy of DHAD for self-resistance. Through genome mining, the authors found three genes that create the tricyclic terpenoid aspterric acid, which is co-clustered with a duplicated DHAD called astD. This study also enabled to understand astD resistance to aspterric acid at the molecular level.", "In 2017, we introduced the \u2018Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker\u2019 (ARTS) (22,23). ARTS allows for the specific and efficient mining of bacterial genomes for the discovery of antibiotics with interesting and novel targets, and it is widely used by academics as well as industrial groups. Here, we present the \u2018fungal bioactive compound resistant target seeker\u2019 (FunARTS) to respond to the increasing demand for a similar tool for the analysis of fungal genomes. We developed a fungal version of our antibiotic-resistant target seeker as a user-friendly web tool that automates target-directed genome mining in all fungal taxa. The aims of FunARTS are to (i) automate the process of target-directed (also called resistance-guided) genome mining in fungi, (ii) screen for potential novel bioactive compound targets, and (iii) prioritize putative secondary metabolite gene clusters for their subsequent characterization."]
