["1. Introduction", "Obesity, as a sub-health stage with the excessive accumulation of body fat, is mainly affected by genetics and lifestyles. Due to the long-term chronic inflammatory state and abnormal metabolism as the hotbed for metabolic, endocrine, cardiovascular, and nervous system diseases, obesity has become a public health problem that is a current research focus all over the world. Currently, nearly one-third of the world\u2019s population is overweight or obese [1]. According to the Epidemiological Survey in China from 2015\u20132019, the obesity rate in China reveals a significant increase, and children and adolescents have also become the hardest-hit areas for obesity [2]. Unhealthy diets such as high-fat and high-sugar diets may cause damage of brain tissues, thus resulting in the decline in cognitive and learning capacity [3]. Therefore, reducing high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and alleviating the impaired brain function have become an urgent problem to be solved.", "There are many ways to intervene obesity, including exercise, diets, drugs, and surgery. Previous studies have demonstrated that obesity-induced impairment of cognitive and memory function can be suppressed and rescued after exercise [4], ketogenic diet [5], and surgical interventions due to body weight loss [6]. Therefore, the gain of body weight may be the culprit. However, adolescents are in the rapid growth and development stage, and surgical, drug, and dietary interventions may adversely affect the body. Exercise is an economical and green intervention strategy for health promotion, physical fitness, and obesity management. Considering the impact of different exercise methods on obesity, swimming intervention that is more suitable for obesity was selected in this study. In addition, previous studies on molecular mechanisms have shown that the decline in cognitive function may be correlated with insulin resistance, neurotrophic factor deficiency, apoptosis, and reduced synaptic plasticity in obesity models, as well as the long-term chronic inflammation at the status of obesity [7]. Insulin resistance in the hippocampus is an important factor that leads to the decline of cognitive function. Insulin resistance may also indirectly result in the adverse impact on synaptic plasticity by reducing the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), eventually leading to the decline of cognitive and memory function [8]. Many studies using HFD-induced obesity mouse models have also documented the increased inflammation, insulin resistance, and reduced BDNF level in the hippocampus [9,10,11,12]. Therefore, reduced inflammation, increased insulin sensitivity, up-regulated BDNF, and suppressed apoptosis of neurons may be the critical molecular mechanisms for ameliorating obesity-induced cognitive decline during the process of body weight loss.", "It is well known that scientific and reasonable exercise can significantly promote the health of the body and reduce the occurrence of sports injuries. Relevant studies have shown that swimming can effectively improve learning and memory functions and increase hippocampal BDNF level [13]. Therefore, in this study, the relevant indicators associated with inflammation, insulin resistance, BDNF level, and apoptosis in hippocampal tissues were detected to uncover the molecular mechanisms for alleviating obesity-induced cognitive impairment upon a swimming intervention in HFD-induced obese mice."]
