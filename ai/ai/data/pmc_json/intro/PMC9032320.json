["1. Introduction", "The emergence and rapid spread of antibiotic resistance among pathogens has become a major healthcare problem worldwide. This problem becomes even worse with a coincident decline in the supply of novel antimicrobial agents [1,2]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the discovery and development of novel antimicrobial drugs that either act on new cellular targets or bypass the development of resistance. Natural products offer a great variety of chemical diversity with distinctive biological activities. It is estimated that more than half of approved drugs, from the period of 1981 to 2019, are either natural products or derivatives thereof [3]. Thus, natural products remain the most promising sources for drug discovery and development [4,5]. In recent years, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have emerged as attractive targets for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs [6]. To ensure the fidelity of protein synthesis, these enzymes catalyze the charging of tRNA with cognate amino acids in a two-step process [7]. The first step involves formation of an aminoacyl\u2013adenylate (aa-AMP) intermediate with concomitant release of pyrophosphate (PPi). In the second step, the aminoacyl moiety is transferred to the 3\u2032-terminal adenosine of the cognate tRNA (Scheme 1). The 20 aaRSs have been classified into two classes: Class \u2160 and Class \u2161, mainly based on the structures of their active sites [7]. Considering the vital role of aaRSs in protein synthesis, it is reasonable to expect that inhibition of these enzymes is detrimental to cell survival.", "Sideromycins are a unique subset of siderophores that are comprised of an antibacterial moiety covalently linked to a siderophore. They are actively transported into bacterial cells via a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d strategy by hijacking the siderophore uptake pathway, that is commonly used by bacteria to scavenge environmental iron [8]. These siderophore-antibiotic conjugates are promising drug candidates for the treatment of various bacterial infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Over the past few decades, only a few naturally occurring sideromycins, such as albomycins, salmycins, and ferrimycins, have been identified [8,9]. Of particular interest are albomycins that function as inhibitors of bacterial seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS). Examples of other aaRSs inhibitors include microcin C and agrocin 84 (Figure 1), targeting aspartyl tRNA synthetase (AspRS) and leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), respectively [10]. The biosynthesis, mode of action and self-resistance of microcin C have been reviewed comprehensively [10,11]. At present, our understanding on synthesis, mode of action and self-resistance of agrocin 84 is still limited [12,13]. In this review, we summarize findings on the discovery and structure elucidation, mode of action, biosynthesis, self-resistance, and chemical synthesis of albomycins."]
