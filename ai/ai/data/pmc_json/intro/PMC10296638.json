["1. Introduction", "Fungi are the source of some of the most important drugs ever discovered, including drugs of historic importance as well as recent blockbuster drugs. These compounds have found essential roles in treating chronic conditions, predominantly for chronic infections (antibiotics and antifungal drugs) autoimmune diseases (immunosuppressants) and hypercholesterolemia (the statins) (Table 1 and Figure 1). More recently, fungal-derived metabolites have been entering clinical trials to treat chronic diseases such as cancer and drug-resistant depression. In this review, we examine the discovery history of established fungal-derived drugs and examine new lead compounds that have recently entered clinical trials. Although different definitions for chronic disease exist, for this review we shall use the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention definition, in which chronic diseases are defined as conditions that last a year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both [1].", "The idea that fungi contain biologically active compounds is not new and pre-dates the rise of scientific methodologies. Indeed, various cultures have long made use of fungi as medicines and hallucinogens [2]. The isolation of pure chemical substances from fungi is not a recent endeavour either. Early examples of compound isolation date back to at least 1893 [3]. Despite this early knowledge of fungal bioactivity, the story of fungal drug discovery in many ways starts with the discovery of penicillin in the 1940s. Penicillin drew the attention of the scientific world to the incredible potential of fungi as a source of therapeutic small molecules. A chance observation of antibiotic antagonism by a contaminant mould on a Petri dish resulted in the eventual discovery of a highly effective antibiotic that would change the course of history.", "The fungal contaminant on Alexander Fleming\u2019s Petri dish was a species of Penicillium but how it got there is unclear. It may have drifted in the air from the laboratory of Charles La Touche, a mycologist working on Penicillium moulds whose laboratory was in the same building [4]. Alternatively, it may simply have come from the air in Fleming\u2019s laboratory; spores of penicillin-producing fungi are after all highly ubiquitous in indoor environments. The fungal contaminant in question, which had previously been misidentified as Penicillium chrysogenum or P. notatum has recently been re-identified as Penicillium rubens [5]. Furthermore, the penicillin isolated from it at Oxford, UK was penicillin F (2-pentenylpenicillin), not penicillin G or penicillin V which are the penicillins used in medicine today [6]. Penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) was isolated in the United States using the strain P. rubens NRRL 1951, (the Wisconsin strain) which was found growing on a mouldy cantaloupe, in Peoria, Illinois. Regardless of its origin, penicillin was not simply a highly effective antibiotic; it was a medicine that changed perceptions as to what was possible in the treatment of bacterial infections. Penicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits the cross-linking of peptidoglycans which are a structural component of bacterial cell walls [7]. Since humans lack a cell wall, penicillin is able to kill bacteria without affecting human cells. Its discovery established fungi as an important source from which to look for therapeutic molecules and begged the question, what other useful medicines might be lurking in what would be later recognised as the kingdom Fungi?", "The next major antibiotic discovery was cephalosporin C, which shares the same beta-lactam structure with the penicillins, and also shares a similar mechanism of action. The producing organism Acremonium chrysogenum had been isolated in 1945 from seawater close to a sewage outfall in Sardinia by local scientist Giuseppe Brotzu, who was investigating the epidemiology of typhoid [8,9]. Brotzu had noticed that although Salmonella was common in the sewers of Sardinia, bathers who swam in the sea rarely contracted Salmonella infections, and he reasoned there might be a process of \u201cself-purification of seawater\u201d. In trying to investigate this hypothesis, he came across a fungal organism that exhibited antibiotic antagonism on a Petri dish, and like Fleming before him, he reasoned it might have therapeutic value [9]. The fungal strain he isolated eventually made its way to Edward Abraham, who had worked on the isolation of penicillin in Oxford, and he was able to chemically isolate cephalosporin C in 1953. The discovery stimulated the development of the wider cephalosporin class of antibiotics which have proved effective against bacteria resistant to penicillin and are still in development today. An interesting parallel between the isolation of cephalosporin C and penicillin drugs is the length of time taken to chemically isolate the active metabolite due to the lack of advanced separation methods available at the time. Given the paucity of effective antibacterial medicines available, it may be pertinent to consider if isolation of a semi-pure fraction would have been sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of these compounds as topical antibiotics. This could have been achieved in a very small fraction of the time taken to achieve the more complete isolation that took many years and significantly delayed the introduction of antibiotics.", "Another valuable antibiotic from a similarly unpalatable source is fusidic acid. Fusidic acid, whose chemical isolation was described in 1962, was obtained from the fermentation of Acremonium fusidioides (reported at the time as Fusidium coccineum). This species was isolated from monkey faeces [10]. Unlike penicillin and cephalosporins, fusidic acid inhibits bacterial protein translation but manages to do so in a way that avoids inhibiting eukaryotic and therefore human protein translation. Fusidic acid is used topically to treat skin or eye infections [10].", "A fungal-derived antibiotic that is infrequently mentioned is fusafungine, which is an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agent used for treating upper respiratory airway disease. It is a mixture of enniatins, obtained from Fusarium lateritium, and its anti-inflammatory mechanism of action is thought to involve the downregulation of expression of ICAM-1 and proinflammatory cytokines [11]. Fusafungine was first authorised in Europe in 1963 but was withdrawn in 2016 due to a risk of serious allergic reactions [12]. More recently, the antibiotic resistance crisis has focused researchers to re-examine neglected fungal antibiotics such as the pleuromutilins, originally isolated in the 1950s from an edible fungus Clitopilus scyphoides, (formerly Pleurotus mutilus) [13]. A synthetic derivative, retapamulin received approval in 2007 for the treatment of superficial skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.", "Paradoxically, fungi have also been an important source of antifungal drugs. Later on, we shall examine how fungi achieve self-resistance to the antifungal compounds they synthesise. An early example of an antifungal compound derived from a fungus is griseofulvin, first reported in 1938 from Penicillium griseofulvum [14]. Griseofulvin is used for treating dermatophyte infections of skin, nails and hair, and is believed to exert its antifungal activity by interfering with mitotic spindle microtubule function [15]. A more recent example of antifungal drugs derived from fungi is the echinocandins which are potent lipopeptide inhibitors of 1,3-\u03b2D-glucan synthase, an enzyme required for cell wall biosynthesis in fungi. The semisynthetic derivatives caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin are first-line antimycotics used for the treatment of invasive mycosis [16]. Caspofungin which received FDA approval in 2001 is a semisynthetic derivative of pneumocandin B0, isolated in 1992 from Glarea lozoyensis, which was discovered in water and sediment from a pond in a farm near Madrid [17,18]. Micafungin which gained regulatory approval in 2005 is a synthetic derivative of the hexapeptide FR901370 isolated from Coleophoma empedra, anidulafungin which gained approval in 2006 is a synthetic derivative of echinocandin B0 isolated from Aspergillus spinulosprous (formerly Aspergillus nidulans var. echinulatus) [16,18].", "A very recent discovery is the triterpene glycoside enfumafungin which was isolated in the year 2000 from extracts of an endophytic species of Hormonema found to be living inside juniper trees [19]. Ibrexafungerp, a synthetic derivative, received approval in 2021 for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The enfumafungin-producing fungal species has since been re-identified as Endoconidioma carpetanum Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB837886 (personal communication Gerald F. Bills), (Figure 2). Although these recent antifungal drug discoveries are all welcome additions to our antifungal drug armamentarium, the emergence of new fungal pathogens such as Candida auris means that antifungal drugs with a more diverse range of mechanisms of action will be needed to avoid the threat of drug resistance in the future [20].", "Fungi have also been a highly successful source of immunosuppressant compounds. The first immunosuppressant drug to be discovered was mycophenolic acid in 1893, although its clinical use is much more recent. Mycophenolic acid was first isolated from Penicillium brevicompactum which is found in spoiled corn silage [3]. Mycophenolic acid inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thereby blocking guanine biosynthesis, which in turn blocks lymphocyte proliferation. It is used as an immunosuppressant for organ transplantation surgery [3]; a synthetic derivative mycophenolate mofetil was approved in 1995 for use during kidney transplantation [21]. A delayed-release tablet produced by Novartis and approved in 2004, achieved annual sales of USD 441 million in 2015 [21]. Mizoribine is an immunosuppressant compound isolated from Penicillium dodgei (formerly Penicillium brefeldianum) which was isolated from a soil sample collected from Hachijo Island in Japan in 1971. Like mycophenolic acid, mizoribine also inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase blocking lymphocyte proliferation in a similar manner [22]. It has been used in Japan since 1984 for the prevention of rejection in renal transplantation [22].", "Notably, there are two fungal-derived immunosuppressant drugs that both come from entomopathogenic fungi. Tolypocladium inflatum, an entomopathogenic fungus whose spore forming structures emerge out of beetle larvae, is the source of cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A inhibits the calcineurin pathway which blocks T-cell activation in humans and has proved pivotal for the field of organ transplantation [23]. Prior to the introduction of cyclosporin A, organ transplantation was considered more of an experimental field of surgery rather than a genuine therapeutic solution, with few patients surviving more than a few weeks [23]. Thus, like penicillin, cyclosporine is a medicine that changed perceptions of what is possible in human medicine. A more recent immunosuppressant success story is fingolimod, a treatment for multiple sclerosis that entered the market in 2011. Fingolimod\u2019s structure took inspiration from the fungal metabolite myriocin, first discovered in 1972 from Melanocarpus albomyces (formerly Myriococcum albomyces), however, its immunosuppressant effects were not realised until 1994 when it was re-discovered from Isaria sinclairii (Figure 2) [24]. Fingolimod (the synthetic compound inspired by myriocin) is produced by Novartis and achieved blockbuster status with more than USD 1 billion in sales revenue in 2012, its second year of distribution [25].", "Another therapeutic area where fungal-derived drugs have proved pivotal and highly lucrative is in the lowering of blood cholesterol levels. In the 1970s, Japanese scientist Akira Endo instigated a project to screen 6000 fungal extracts for inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis and in doing so discovered mevastatin (compactin) from Penicillium citrinum, a mould that infects Citrus unshiu, a type of Japanese orange [26]. Another statin drug, lovastatin was first reported from Monascus ruber in 1979 (reported as monacolin K) [27] and Aspergillus terreus in 1980 (reported as mevinolin) [28]. In 1987, lovastatin became the first statin to be granted FDA approval as a cholesterol-lowering drug, followed later on by mevastatin [29]. Statins act as competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase whose activity is required for cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins are one of the largest selling drug classes in the world, with sales in 2005 reported to be USD 25 billion [29].", "Lastly, there are the ergot alkaloid drugs from Claviceps purpurea which grow on cereal crops resulting in their spoilage. Consumption of infected crops such as rye had been long known to be associated with ergotism, which causes burning sensations, convulsions and even hallucinations. The spores of Claviceps purpurea are carried by the wind and infect the ovaries of young rye plants. Their hyphae then take over the grain, replacing it with fungal tissue to form a hardened curved purple-coloured spur [30]. Ergot poisoning, which can cause paranoia and hallucinations occurs in people who ingest the infected grain. Outbreaks of ergotism, also known as St. Anthony\u2019s Fire, are well documented in historical texts and were particularly prevelent in the Middle Ages in Europe with thousands of people affected [31]. Ergotamine, a constituent of Claviceps purpurea is a serotonin receptor agonist that was first isolated in 1918 [32]. Ergotamine tartrate has been used to treat migraines for many decades [33]. Ergot also has a long history of use in obstetric medicine, the first reference to the use of ergot in childbirth dates to Germany in 1582 [30]. Ergometrine maleate, a derivative of ergometrine, is used in the management of postpartum haemorrhage, it induces uterine contractions via agonist effects on myometrial 5-HT2 receptors [30,34]. Bromocriptine, a synthetic derivative of ergocryptine, is used for hyperprolactinaemia-related conditions in obstetric medicine. It is a dopamine agonist that blocks the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland [31,35].", "Despite the very high revenues derived from certain fungal-derived drugs, by the late 1990s screening programs were failing to produce promising new compounds and were started to be wound down. The low-hanging fruit that produced useful compounds had all been discovered and it was becoming harder and more expensive to find promising drug leads from fungi. However, ninety-two years after the discovery of penicillin, fungal drug discovery is making a comeback. Several new fungal metabolites are currently in clinical trials and new commercial players are entering the field with the hope of applying novel genomics-based approaches to finding the next blockbuster drug."]
