["Introduction", "The overuse of antibiotics accelerates the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacteria, thereby reducing the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy (Cohen et al., 2017). The proliferation of ARGs has been a major problem of antibiotic contamination in the environment, which may lead to the emergence of multidrug-resistant human pathogens and ultimately reduce the efficiency of antibiotic therapy (Mahnert et al., 2019; Tiedje et al., 2019). With the rapid development of large-scale breeding industry, the problem of ARGs contamination caused by antibiotic abuse is becoming increasingly prominent (Rahman et al., 2018). The farmland application of livestock manure can amend the soil fertility and ensure sustainable soil productivity, which has a long agricultural history, and is being vigorously promoted due to the rising cost of fertilizer as well as the necessity of unwanted wastes disposal (Zhen et al., 2014). Currently, returning manure to the field is an effective way of livestock manure resource utilization, which could realize the circulation of agricultural planting and breeding resources (Xie et al., 2018; Zhi et al., 2022).", "However, ARGs inevitably transfers horizontally into the farmland along with fertilization, causing serious pollution to soil environment (Zhu D. et al., 2019; Han et al., 2021). Several studies have examined the effect of manure amendment on the fate and migration of ARGs in soil (Duan et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021), where the use of manure containing residual antibiotics generally increased soil ARGs. Gu et al. (2020) found that application of pig manure, chicken manure and cow manure increased soil ARG abundances in soil by 36, 30 and 11 times, respectively, compared with the control soil. Liu et al. (2021) found that the abundance and diversity of ARGs showed an upward trend in farmland soils with repeated and continuous application of livestock manure. Obviously, manure application significantly increased the diversity and abundance of ARGs in soil, and also markedly changed the composition of bacteria related to ARGs profiles (Pu et al., 2020; Barrios et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2022). ARGs-resistant bacteria contained in the soil environment may enter the plant through horizontal transfer from endophytes, and transfer exogenous ARGs to the plant endophytic system (Guron et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019b). A large number of ARGs and a variety of related integrons have been found in fresh fruits and vegetables, increasing the risk of transmission from ARGs to humans through the food chain (Zhang et al., 2019).", "The accumulation and propagation of ARGs in soil were significantly affected by different fertilization patterns. Studies have shown that the application of chemical fertilizer and organic fertilizer can increase the level of ARGs compared with the soil without fertilization (Xu et al., 2019; Wang F. H. et al., 2020). In particular, the application of livestock manure can significantly increase the diversity and abundance of ARGs in soil, resulting in the improvement of microbial resistance level in soil environment (Gu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Han et al., 2021). In order to achieve \u201creducing fertilizer and controlling pollution,\u201d it is necessary to optimize fertilization mode and structure to improve the use efficiency of agricultural fertilizer and accelerate the construction of ecological circular agriculture (Zhou et al., 2019a; Chen et al., 2021; Sanz et al., 2021; Xu F. et al., 2021). However, there are few studies on the distribution pattern and vertical migration of ARGs in paddy-upland rotation fields with unique habitat, especially under different fertilization modes (Lin et al., 2016; Rahman et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2022). The results are helpful to clarify the occurrence characteristics of soil ARGs pollution spectrum under different fertilization modes, further understand the effects of different fertilization modes on farmland ecosystem, and explore the optimal fertilization mode.", "In this study, the paddy-upland rotation fields in Erhai River basin of Yunnan Province were selected for research, where were set up a plot experiment (chemical fertilizer, substitution model of different amount of livestock manure, slow release fertilizer). High throughput-quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) combined with real-time quantification PCR (qPCR) were used to explore the occurrence profiles and vertical migration patterns of ARGs in paddy-upland rotation fields under different fertilization modes. Meanwhile, we also further studied microbial communities and environmental factors, and their contribution on ARG shift in paddy-upland rotation fields, further aiming to find an appropriate agricultural fertilization to mitigate and control the spread of ARGs in farmland. This work would provide a reference for the pollution control and risk assessment of ARGs in paddy-upland rotation soil."]
