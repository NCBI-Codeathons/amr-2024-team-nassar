["Introduction", "The concept that bacteria can be grouped into phylogenetically cohesive clusters with properties that allow them to be regarded as \u201cspecies\u201d remains controversial1, 2. It is challenging to determine which clusters represent species level units of diversity and if ecological or evolutionary theory can be invoked to explain the circumstances that led to their formation3. As Gevers et al. lament4, \u201cany effort to produce a robust species definition is hindered by the lack of a solid theoretical basis explaining the effects of biological processes on cohesion within and divergence between species\u201d. Nonetheless, identifying meaningful groups of bacteria and ascribing formal Latinized names remains useful in clinical, environmental, and experimental contexts5. In the absence of a robust species concept for bacteria, we are left with a series of metrics used to gauge the relatedness among strains and phylogenetic frameworks within which species level units of diversity are often arbitrarily assigned.", "It is widely recognized that bacterial species concepts should consider both genetic diversity and ecology2, 6, 7. Buckley and Roberts stated that, \u201cin moving forward with microbial taxonomy, it is critical to determine whether microorganisms cluster in groups with meaningful commonalities or determine what commonalities may be best used to cluster microorganisms into meaningful groups\u201d8. The ecotype model states that bacterial species should fall into well-supported sequence clusters that evolve under cohesive processes and are ecologically distinct and irreversibly separated from each other6. A fundamental tenant of this model is that ecologically distinct populations can be recognized as clades in phylogenetic trees and that these clades correspond to fundamental units of diversity or species2, 6.", "Confounding the common ancestry inferred by phylogenetic reconstruction is homologous recombination. While the efficiency of homologous recombination decreases with increasing genetic distance9, it nonetheless occurs between different species10. The homologous exchange of genes encoding common housekeeping functions creates challenges for species delineations based on single gene phylogenies and led to the use\u00a0of techniques such as multi-locus sequence analysis1. However, even when multiple loci are considered, an accurate model of vertical inheritance can be difficult to depict due to widespread recombination between species11, 12 including ancestral events that have subsequently become fixed among subclades13. While the rates of recombination vary widely among bacteria14, it remains largely unknown how this process affects species-level phylogenetic resolution when whole genomes are considered.", "Whole-genome sequencing has become an indispensable tool for studying genome evolution, genetic diversity, and bacterial species concepts. It has recently been suggested that genome sequences should be used as a source of taxonomic information15. One genome-based metric that is gaining acceptance is the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) of the sequences shared between strains. It has been shown that an ANI of 95% corresponds to the 70% DNA:DNA hybridization value traditionally used to delineate bacterial species16 thus establishing a link to bacterial systematics. Genome sequences also provide unique opportunities to generate highly resolved phylogenies, with automated pipelines to build genomic phylogenies from concatenated protein markers now available17. While there is no agreement regarding how many genes it takes to generate a robust phylogenomic evolutionary tree, genome sequences provide comprehensive datasets from which to address evolutionary relationships and predict lateral gene transfer events18.", "The marine actinomycete genus Salinispora provides a valuable model to address bacterial species concepts19, 20. It is comprised of three closely related species (S. arenicola, S. tropica, and S. pacifica) within the family Micromonosporeaceae21, 22 whose relationships could not be confidently resolved based on 16S rRNA gene phylogeny23, 24. The genus is a rich source of structurally diverse natural products25, and there is evidence that certain compounds26 and their associated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)27 are fixed at the species level. This has been used to suggest that secondary metabolites represent ecotype-defining traits for S. tropica and S. arenicola. Similar patterns were not observed for S. pacifica\n26, the most diverse of the three species24. This greater diversity, coupled with the relatively low recombination to mutation rates observed within the S. pacifica clade, were used to suggest it represents an amalgam of ecotypes or newly diverged species19. While all three species are prolific in terms of natural product biosynthesis, it was shown that S. arenicola differentially invests in interference competition, while S. tropica invests in growth thus establishing these co-occurring lineages as distinct ecotypes28. Here we present a phylogenomic analysis of the genus Salinispora based on the shared gene content among 119 strains. The goals were to assess species level diversity and address the effects of recombination on species level phylogenetic reconstruction."]
