["1. Introduction", "Streptomycetes are soil bacteria that are well-known for their complex morphological differentiation and ability to produce a plethora of natural products with pharmaceutical value [1,2,3]. To date, the genus Streptomyces produces more than half of the clinically used antibiotics and is still considered to be a promising source for novel antibiotics discovery [4].", "To coordinate development and secondary metabolite production, Streptomyces developed a complex regulatory network with multiple overlapping cascade systems. This includes sigma factors, transduction systems, and transcriptional factors of different families [5,6,7].", "The onset and level of natural product production are determined in accordance to environmental signals, nutrition, and the physiological state of growing cells [6,8]. In Streptomyces, specific low molecular weight signalling molecules such as gamma-butyrolactones and guanosine penta/tetraphosphate ((p)ppGpp) trigger secondary metabolism production and morphological differentiation [9,10,11,12]. Recently, intracellular second messenger cyclic di-GMP was also shown to exert a regulatory function on biosynthesis of natural products [13,14,15].", "Genes involved in synthesis of natural product are clustered together. In general, Streptomyces chromosome harbors 20\u201330 biosynthetic gene clusters for secondary metabolites [6,16]. Typically, a biosynthetic gene cluster encodes a cluster-situated regulator, which directly controls the transcriptional levels of genes for production of the cognate natural product. Interestingly, some clusters can contain none or several regulatory genes [6,17,18,19,20]. The cluster-situated regulator in turn is controlled by higher-level regulatory elements like pleiotropic or global regulators [21]. Most of the cluster-situated regulators act as activators, and belong to the SARP (Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins) family [6,21]. The most intensively studied SARPs are ActII-ORF4 and RedD, activators of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin production in S. coelicolor, respectively [6,22,23,24,25]. The promoter region of actII-ORF4 is a regulatory target of few superior transcriptional factors including AdpA, AbsA2, DasR, AfsQ1 and others [26,27,28,29].", "Streptomyces bottropensis is a known producer of the macrocyclic peptide antibiotic bottromycin and type II polyketides\u2014rishirilides and mensacarcin [30]. Rishirilide A and B act as inhibitors of \u03b12-macroglobulin, whereas rishirilide B exhibits an additional inhibition activity towards glutathione-S-transferase [31,32]. Genes for rishirilides biosynthesis (rsl-genes) are clustered together and were recently functionally characterized [33].", "Rishirilides are synthesized from the valine-derived isobutyl-CoA starter unit and malonyl-CoA extenders, followed by decarboxylation of one acetate unit giving a methyl group. The minimal PKS complex derives a linear tricyclic intermediate, which is further modified by cluster-encoded tailoring enzymes [33,34]. Interestingly, the rishirilide scaffold is formed in two key steps: a reductive ring opening of an epoxide moiety on polycyclic intermediate by the flavin-dependent reductase RslO5, followed by an extraordinary oxidative carbon backbone rearrangement catalyzed by flavin-dependent Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase RslO9 [35].", "In addition to biosynthetic and transporter genes, four regulators are encoded by the rsl-gene cluster. However, detailed function of these transcriptional factors in the biosynthesis of rishirilides remained unclear. In this work, we have generated rslR1, rslR2, rslR3, and rslR4 deficient mutants and analyzed their ability to produce rishirilides. Inactivation of rslR1-R3 completely abolished biosynthesis, whereas a deletion of rslR4 had no substantial effect on a production level. The overexpression of rslR1, rslR2, and rslR3 in S. bottropensis greatly increased titers of rishirilides accumulation, suggesting that RslR1, RslR2, and RslR3 are positive regulators. In order to identify putative interconnections between studied regulators, the expression of regulatory genes was analyzed in wild type and in mutant strains by RT-PCR and a GusA reporter system. RslR3 was shown to exert positive control on the transcription of rslR2. This finding was further confirmed by direct binding of RslR3 to the rslR2 promoter. Moreover, both RslR1 and RslR2 negatively control transcription of rslR2.", "RslR4 is involved in the regulation of strain immunity. It modulates transcriptional levels of the MFS transporter rslT4 and its own gene. We also demonstrated that the final biosynthetic products and key pathway intermediates interact with RslR4 and release the protein from a target DNA."]
