["INTRODUCTION", "Pseudomonas mesoacidophila was isolated from Japanese soil samples in the late 1970s (1). It is known to produce the sulfamate monobactam isosulfazecin (1) and the bulgecins (2), a group of sulfated glycopeptides that inhibit lytic transglycosylases (3) and metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (4) and potentiate \u03b2-lactam activity (2, 5). Pseudomonas and other soil Gram-negative bacterial genera, such as Stenotrophomonas and Burkholderia, often show high levels of resistance to antibiotics (6). For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common nosocomial pathogen with reduced susceptibility to a range of antibiotics, due to low membrane permeability, chromosomal multidrug efflux pumps, overexpressed \u03b2-lactamases, and the acquisition of multidrug resistance plasmids (6, 7). Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen (8), and several Burkholderia species, even environmental isolates, are resistant to a wide range of antibiotic classes (9). Species of both Pseudomonas and Burkholderia produce an array of specialized bioactive metabolites (10, 11). Despite these findings, the full biosynthetic potential and antibiotic susceptibility of P. mesoacidophila have not been reported. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of P. mesoacidophila, and we show that this species shares an antimicrobial-resistant phenotype characteristic of Burkholderia and should be reclassified phylogenetically as a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex."]
