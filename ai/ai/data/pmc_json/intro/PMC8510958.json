["Introduction", "Streptomyces is the most prolific genus of the phylum Actinobacteria in terms of secondary metabolites production with high societal impact. It is estimated that members of the genus Streptomyces produce more than 50% of bioactive compounds produced by bacteria (Doroghazi and Metcalf, 2013). The variety of bioactive compounds produced by this genus include, among others, antifungals (e.g., amphotericin B by Streptomyces nodosus), anti-parasitic (e.g., avermectins by Streptomyces avermitilis), antivirals (e.g., virantmycin by Streptomyces nitrosporeus), immunosuppressant (e.g., rapamycin by Streptomyces hygroscopicus and other strains), chemotherapeutics (e.g., daunorubicin by Streptomyces peucetius), and a wide variety of antibiotics as tetracycline produced by Streptomyces rimosus and streptomycin produced by Streptomyces griseus (Nakagawa et al., 1981; Pham et al., 2019).", "The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies unveiled the metabolic potential of bacteria as producers of secondary metabolites. Streptomyces coelicolor, for instance, only produces actinorhodin, undecylprodigiosin, calcium-dependent antibiotic and methylenomycin at laboratory conditions, though its genome contains over 20 biosynthetic gene clusters (Challis and Hopwood, 2003). The rapid progress on genomic sequencing and the decrease in sequencing prices have enabled obtaining a vast quantity of genomes that has led to a deeper knowledge of microorganisms capable of synthesizing bioactive compounds, and the discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters that might produce novel compounds with clinical and commercial value (Kalkreuter et al., 2020).", "The analysis of such amount of genomic data is a challenge; nevertheless, it may pave the way for performing comparative genomics studies, which help revealing the microbial diversity of a genus, genes involved in environmental adaptations, antibiotic resistance, and genes that confer the ability to colonize novel niches (Tettelin et al., 2008; Niu, 2018). Previous comparative genomic studies in the genus Streptomyces showed the genetic variability and the biosynthetic potential of the genus (Jackson et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Belknap et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020); genes involved in osmotic stress defense, symbiotic interactions, among other environmental niche adaptation genes were identified in marine Streptomyces (Tian et al., 2016; Almeida et al., 2019).", "These reports, however, include only a few Streptomyces strains or a mix of complete and incomplete genomes that could render unreliable results. In this study, we present the first comparative genomic study for the genus Streptomyces with a large amount of complete and high-quality genomes available, unveiling the pan-genome in terms of protein sequence similarity and protein domains content, describing phylogenetic relationships of the analyzed genomes, as well as highlighting the variability of their intergenic regions (IGRs) and their capability of producing bioactive compounds; the study prioritizes in the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) with potential antibiotic activity and a predicted mode of action according to the co-localization of duplicated self-resistance genes."]
