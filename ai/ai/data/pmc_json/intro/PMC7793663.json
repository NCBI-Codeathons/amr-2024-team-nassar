["Introduction", "Stroke refers to a group of diseases that cause brain tissue damage due to the sudden rupture of blood vessels or the blockage of blood flow into the brain, including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. It has the characteristics of high morbidity and high mortality. Ischemic stroke accounts for ~87% of the total number of stroke patients (1). Ischemic stroke refers to a type of disease in which brain tissue necrosis is caused by a narrowing or occlusion of the blood supply arteries (carotid and vertebral arteries) of the brain and insufficient blood supply to the brain. At present, thrombolysis is considered to be the most important method for the treatment of ischemic stroke (2). However, due to the limitations of current thrombolytic therapy such as an optimal treatment time window of only 4.5 h (3), enhancing the self-resistance and protection of neurons has become the focus which has attracted more researchers (4).", "Mitochondria are where the oxidative metabolism of eukaryotes takes place, and the major producers of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). They can also regulate membrane potential and control programmed cell death (5). Based on the complex structure and important functions of mitochondria, they are closely related to many diseases including ischemic stroke. When ischemic stroke occurs, the dynamic balance maintained by mitochondria is broken, and related signaling pathways are activated, which lead to cascade damage to nerve cells (6). In the ischemic period of ischemic stroke, mitochondria cannot synthesize enough ATP or cause energy disorders due to lack of oxygen and energy substances. During the reperfusion period, the increase of ROS and mitochondrial membrane lipid peroxidation lead to oxidative stress damage. Increased ROS also disrupts the calcium pump on the mitochondrial membrane, which induces calcium overload and inflammatory response. In addition to these pathological changes, cell death in ischemic stroke including apoptosis and autophagy are all related to the loss of mitochondrial function (7). Therefore, the research on the correlation between mitochondria and ischemic stroke can not only fully explain the mechanism of the occurrence and development of ischemic stroke, but also provide potential guidance and help for the innovative treatment of ischemic stroke.", "Autophagy is a biological process in which organelles and proteins are degraded by lysosomes in eukaryotic cells (8). One of the main functions of autophagy is to keep cells alive when they are threatened by stressful death (9). This is an important evolutionary conservation mechanism for eukaryotic cells to maintain homeostasis and achieve renewal (10). Although autophagy in a broad sense includes macroautophagy, microautophagy and chapeon-mediated autophagy (11), it is commonly referred to as macroautophagy. Mitophagy is a type of macroautophagy by which cells selectively clear impaired or dysfunctional mitochondria through the mechanism of autophagy (12). It plays an important role in mitochondrial quality control and cell survival (13). More and more studies have shown that mitophagy is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD) and Huntington's (HD) and brain injury (14). Although there have been studies showing that mitophagy is closely related to ischemic stroke (4, 15), the exact roles of mitophagy still need to be studied further. In this review, we focus on the research progress in the occurrence and regulation of mitophagy in ischemic stroke."]
