["INTRODUCTION", "Bacteria are exceptionally rich sources of secondary metabolites, which are important for their survival and often have therapeutic value. Streptomyces produce 35% of all known microbial natural products and nearly 70% of all commercially useful antibiotics, with several being FDA-approved antitumor agents used as first-line cancer treatments (1\u20134). Secondary metabolites are often toxins used in ecological interactions with other organisms and can target any number of critical cellular functions (5). Natural products that damage DNA (genotoxins) form covalent or noncovalent DNA adducts that can inhibit replication and transcription, undermining genomic integrity through mutagenesis or cell death (6, 7). Consequently, genotoxins are particularly useful antineoplastic agents, as exemplified by several clinically relevant drugs, including doxorubicin, bleomycin, mitomycin C, and duocarmycin analogs (8).", "Streptomyces produce a wide variety of DNA alkylating and oxidizing agents that have antimicrobial and antitumor properties. Spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienones (duocarmycin A and SA, yatakemycin, and CC-1065) (9, 10), pluramycins (pluramycin A, hedamycin, and altromycin) (11\u201313), anthracycline glycosides (trioxacarcin A and LL-D49194\u03b11) (14\u201316), and the leinamycin family (17) contain a single reactive group that covalently modifies purine nucleobases to form a broad spectrum of bulky alkyl-DNA monoadducts. Streptomyces also produce bifunctional alkylating agents that react with nucleobases on both DNA strands to create interstrand cross-links (ICLs). Mitomycin C (MMC) from S. lavendulae cross-links guanines at their N2 positions, and azinomycin A and B (AZA and AZB) from S. sahachiroi and S. griseofuscus cross-link purines at their N7 nitrogens (18). In addition to alkylating agents, several families of natural products, including bleomycins and enediynes, exert their toxicity by oxidative cleavage of DNA and RNA (19).", "The production of secondary metabolites in Streptomyces is genetically organized into biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which contain the genes necessary for their biosynthesis, export, regulation, and resistance. Resistance mechanisms protect antibiotic producers from toxicity of their own natural products and include toxin sequestration, efflux, modification, destruction, and target repair/protection (20, 21). In the case of genotoxins, several DNA repair enzymes have been identified as target repair resistance mechanisms, including direct reversal of streptozotocin alkylation by AlkB and AGT (alkylguanine alkyltransferase) homologs (22), base excision of yatakemycin-adenine adducts by the DNA glycosylase YtkR2 (23, 24), nucleotide excision of DNA adducts of several intercalating agents, including daunorubicin (25), and putative replication-coupled repair of distamycin-DNA adducts (26).", "The AZB gene cluster in Streptomyces sahachiroi encodes a DNA glycosylase, AlkZ, which unhooks AZB-ICLs and provides cellular resistance against AZB toxicity (27, 28). ICL unhooking by AlkZ involves hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bonds of the cross-linked deoxyguanosine residues, producing abasic (AP) sites that can be repaired by the base excision repair pathway (29). AlkZ belongs to the relatively uncharacterized HTH_42 superfamily of proteins found in antibiotic-producing and pathogenic bacteria (28). The crystal structure of AlkZ revealed a unique C-shaped architecture formed by three tandem winged helix-turn-helix motifs, with two catalytically essential glutamine residues within a Q\u03a6Q motif (\u03a6 is an aliphatic residue) located at the center of the concave surface (30). We recently characterized a second HTH_42 protein from Escherichia coli, YcaQ, as a DNA glycosylase that excises several types of N7-alkylguanine ICLs and monoadducts using a catalytic Q\u03a6D motif and that functions as a secondary pathway to nucleotide excision repair for bacterial resistance to the nitrogen mustard mechlorethamine (31).", "The targeted discovery of natural products has been employed to search for novel scaffolds in plants, fungi, and bacteria and can be useful for identifying specific classes of compounds (32\u201334). Genome mining can be used to search for unidentified BGCs through analysis of core/accessory biosynthetic genes (PKS, NRPS, and tailoring enzymes), comparative/phylogeny-based mining, regulatory genes, and, more recently, resistance genes (35). Some of these resistance-based mining approaches focus on the experimental screening of antibiotic resistance, while others rely on bioinformatic tools to identify resistance genes within clusters based on homology to known resistance genes (36\u201339). However, many of these resistance-based methods have not been applied in bacteria for targeted discovery.", "Here, we characterized the genomic differences of the HTH_42 proteins found in 435 species of Streptomyces to develop additional insight into this new family of DNA repair proteins and applied this information in resistance-guided genome mining to characterize unknown BGCs or identify new genotoxins. We found that these proteins fall into two distinct subfamilies that are delineated by amino acid sequence, genomic context, and copy number. Proteins similar to S. sahachiroi AlkZ (AlkZ-like, AZL) are highly variable in sequence and enriched in BGCs, many producing known genotoxic alkylating agents. We show that the AZL protein within the BGC of the known DNA alkylating agent hedamycin (HED) is a resistance DNA glycosylase specific for HED-guanine lesions, consistent with AZL-mediated DNA repair activity as a general self-resistance mechanism to genotoxins in antibiotic producers. Moreover, we found AZL proteins in BCGs that are either uncharacterized or that produce natural products not previously known to be genotoxic, validating resistance genome mining as an approach to discover new genotoxins. In contrast, E. coli YcaQ-like (YQL) proteins are highly conserved in sequence and genetic neighborhood and are not associated with BGCs. We show that like E. coli YcaQ, two YQL enzymes from Actinobacteria have weaker substrate specificity than AZL proteins, suggesting a broader role of this subfamily of HTH_42 proteins outside antibiotic self-resistance in bacteria."]
