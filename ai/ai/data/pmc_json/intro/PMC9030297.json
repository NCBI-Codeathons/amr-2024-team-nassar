["1. Introduction", "Gliotoxin (GT) is a fungal toxin belonging to the family of epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) which possesses antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions [1]. Its chemical structure is defined by the presence of a transannular disulfide bond, formed by the addition of two sulfur atoms to the cyclic bond of amino acids L-Ser and L-Phe. In fact, the high reactivity of this chemical group confers GT the ability to cross-link other biological molecules through formation of a disulfide bridge and to generate reactive oxygen species by redox cycling [2,3]. Indeed, most of its biological roles are due to its structure and reactivity.", "GT has been found to exert biocidal activity against a large number of species belonging to almost all kingdoms of life, and also against some viruses. In case of bacteria, GT inhibits in vitro growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Microsporum gypseum, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis [4,5,6]. In regard to the kingdom of fungi, GT has been reported to prevent in vitro growth of human pathogen C. albicans [7]. Protozoa such as P. falciparum, which is responsible for malaria disease, are also susceptible to the presence of GT [8]. Furthermore, antiviral activity of GT against a wide range of viruses such as Nipah virus, Hendra virus, polio virus, herpes simplex virus, coxsackie virus or influenza A virus [9,10,11,12] among others has been described.", "A separated mention is required for GT roles in animals, especially mammals. GT is secreted during infection by A. fumigatus in order to avoid host immunity and help colonization. Indeed, GT is known to be a virulence factor of this fungus that enhances invasion of mouse lungs, leading to an increased mortality [3,13,14,15]. GT is secreted during the first steps of conidial germination and hyphae invasion because it can be detected in lungs from infected mice since day 1 post infection [16]. Secreted GT might play a critical role in fungal survival because it inhibits macrophage phagocytosis, causes apoptotic cell death in macrophages and monocytes, blocks cytokine production through inhibition of transcription factor NF-\u03baB, and prevent degranulation of mast cells [3,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Apart from its role as virulence factors and its potential function during host invasion, GT has been shown to induce apoptosis in a vast range of tumoral cells such as mouse L929 fibroblast cells, human and rat hepatic stellate cells, human cervical cancer cells or colorectal cancer cells [24,25,26,27]. Thus, it has been proposed as a potential anti-cancer drug, albeit due to its toxicity against healthy tissues/cells, and selective ways of delivery to cancer cells will be required before it could be tested in vivo like it was recently proposed [28]. In addition, due to its high biological activity and potential harmful effects against mammals and other species, GT contamination of human and animal food has raised several concerns in recent years [29,30,31].", "Like many other fungal secondary metabolites, enzymes that synthetize GT are encoded in a gene cluster. A. fumigatus GT gene cluster (gli cluster), which is one of the most studied, contains 13 genes needed for GT biosynthesis [32] (Figure 1). At one end of the gene cluster, it is placed gliZ, which is a zinc finger transcription factor responsible for the expression of several genes into the cluster [15]. One of those genes is gliP that encodes a non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) responsible for the first step in GT biosynthesis. GliP is a three-module NRPS (A1-T1-C1-A2-T2-C2-T3) which is capable of synthesizing a cyclic peptide by linking L-Phe and L-Ser [33]. Although it lacks a thioesterase domain that enables the releasing of the cyclopeptide, in vitro studies using a purified enzyme have shown that this happens slowly using a wild type A. fumigatus Af293 GliP [33].", "Once the diketopiperazine backbone is synthetized, cytochrome P450 GliC catalyzes the next step by hydroxylation of both old L-Phe and L-Ser alpha carbons [35]. Two sulfur atoms are added subsequently by the substitution of the recently bonded hydroxyl groups by two glutathione molecules. This reaction is carried out by the enzyme GliG [36]. Complete removal of glutation molecules is performed by three proteins named GliK, GliJ, and GliI [37]. GliK, a gamma glutamyl cyclotransferase, releases glutamyl moieties from glutathione linked to the backbone; GliJ, a dipeptidase, cleaves glycines forming the remaining glutathione; and GliI, a lyase, breaks the C-S bond completely eliminating the remaining moiety from the backbone [37]. In this way, the released product (3-benzyl-3,6-dithio-6-(hydroxymethyl)-diketopiperazine or dithiol gliotoxin) contains the two characteristic thiol groups of GT.", "Next step in GT biosynthesis is considerably important. As thiol groups can react with many other molecules, GliT (thioreductase) oxidizes both groups by forming a disulfide bond and minimizing self-toxicity induced by this GT intermediate [38,39,40]. Dithiol GT is also a substrate for GtmA, to be converted to Bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin (bmGT) [41,42]. Once GT is produced it will induce gli cluster expression [43] or be secreted from A. fumigatus via GliA [44]. Due to the high GT reactivity A. fumigatus has developed self-protection mechanisms being the two most important, bmGT formation that will inactivate the toxin and secretion that will reduce gli expression and GT production [41].", "Several fungal species have been suggested to synthetize GT, such as Trichoderma lignorum [45], Trichoderma virens [46], Penicillium obscurum [46], Gliocladium fimbriatum [47], Candida albicans [48], and different Aspergillus spp., such as A. fumigatus [49], A. terreus, A. niger, and A. flavus [50], among others. However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding GT synthesis in some of these fungal families [46,50,51,52,53]. Although there are differences between the gene clusters involved in GT synthesis depending on the fungal species that possess it, such as the number of genes that it contains or their synteny and disposition, there are also similarities between them as we expose in this work. Since GT production by different fungal species might be relevant for diverse fields including heath, food, and agriculture, it would be important to know which environmental fungus might produce GT.", "Here we apply different bioinformatic strategies to search and study protein structures of several fungal species most similar to gli cluster and concretely gliP of A. fumigatus. We start from the fact that high sequence similarity provides a similar three-dimensional protein structure, which is a determining factor in its biological activity. Thereby, the alleged GT production in these species could be encoded by the same or similar gene cluster or perhaps similar genes. In order to shed some light on the controversy that currently exists about which fungal species are GT producers, an extensive study of the species sequences was carried out using different bioinformatic tools. In silico studies empower us to find similar genetical or proteinic sequences among all the species whose genomes have been sequenced, and ease the search of these sequences and allow inferring that the sequences of different species that share a high grade of similarity can retain the same function. However, the bioinformatic study must be complemented with the in vitro detection and quantification of GT production in specific selected strains in order to confirm if in silico predictions were accurate."]
