["1. Introduction", "Antibiotics produced by microorganisms have made a significant contribution to human health. Among them, Actinomycetes are the most important sources for drug lead compounds. However, researchers have been turned to rare Actinomycetes to develop novel antibiotics with the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria [1]. In 1986, Lechevalier et al. defined Amycolatopsis as a new genus to accommodate nocardioform Actinomycetes having type IV cell wall composition and lacking mycolic acids [2]. Up to now, by searching in the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature website (http://www.bacterio.net, accessed on 20 September 2020), this genus covered 94 verified species and 4 subspecies, and forms a unique branch in the evolutionary tree of Pseudonocardiaceae. Among 26 species covered in this review, most of them colonize in a wide variety of soil and a few species survival in terrestrial (insect, lichen, island, plant) and marine (sponge, sediment) environment. The various habitats allow Amycolatopsis to produce abundant secondary metabolites.", "The genus Amycolatopsis is regarded as an important source of diverse valuable bioactive natural products covering many antibiotics [3]. The most notable antibiotics produced by Amycolatopsis strains include rifamycin [4] and vancomycin [5]. In the early 1950s, vancomycin had been first extracted from Amycolatopsis orientalis that was originally regarded as Streptomyces orientalis [6]. Vancomycin was introduced for clinical use in 1958 and sparsely used during the first 30 years of its introduction, due to its fewer advantages over semisynthetic antibiotics like penicillin, cephalosporin, lincomycin, and fluoroquinolones. Later, the complex chemical structure of vancomycin was ultimately described in 1983 [7]. The genes of OxyB, OxyA and OxyC, encoding three cytochrome P450 enzymes, have been proven to play an important role in three aromatic cross-links of vancomycin in that order [8]. The discovery of X-domain demonstrated the role of OxyA and OxyB, which introduce bisaryl ether linkages with the help of X-domain; however, the mechanism of final crosslink of the biaryl bond installed by OxyC has not been found yet [9]. In 1959, rifamycin was isolated from Amycolatopsis mediterranei, which was the first group of antimicrobials targeting RNA polymerase. The genes of RifZ and RifQ were crucial regulatory factors of rifamycin biosynthesis. RifZ directly regulated transcription of all operons within the rifamycin biosynthesis gene cluster [10]. RifQ inhibited the export of rifamycin B and inactivating it could increase the yield of rifamycin B without affecting the growth of the A. mediterranei [11]. The understanding of metabolite biosynthesis is helpful to the rational operation of biosynthetic pathways, so as to achieve the goal of producing new natural antibiotics. At present, there are few studies on the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites of Amycolatopsis [12]. We believe that outstanding bioactive compounds from Amycolatopsis deserve to be further researched on the mechanism of action, biosynthesis and regulatory genes. Some Amycolatopsis species have also been demonstrated to possess great potential in degrading plastics, treating heavy metals, and biotransformation. Herein, we describe a detailed summary about the chemical structures and bioactivities of secondary metabolites from Amycolatopsis reported during 1990\u20132020 by searching in the Web of Science, Google Scholar and PubMed. In addition, the biosynthetic pathways of several potent bioactive compounds and the derivatives of secondary metabolites via chemical synthesis, semi-synthesis and biosynthesis are also described in this paper."]
