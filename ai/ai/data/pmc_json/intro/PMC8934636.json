["INTRODUCTION", "Genome stability and integrity are continually challenged by both intrinsic and extrinsic genotoxic agents that generate a diversity of DNA damage through oxidation, alkylation, or hydrolytic deamination (1). Among the most common forms of damage are those derived from alkylating agents, which can potentially modify any of the heteroatoms in duplex DNA. Different sites are alkylated depending on the nature of the DNA-alkylating agents. The resulting DNA damage\u2014including single or double strand breaks, inter- or intra-strand crosslinks, base detachment and base modification\u2014interferes with normal cellular processes, causing DNA mutations, chromosomal rearrangements and instability, which can contribute to heritable diseases and even cell death (2,3). Due to their cytotoxicity, DNA damaging agents often possess certain antimicrobial or antitumor activities, and some of them are used extensively as drugs in cancer treatment (4\u20138).", "In the cell, DNA damage is repaired by several highly conserved pathways (2). Alkylated DNA is eliminated from the genome predominantly by direct reversal, base excision repair (BER), or nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways (9\u201313). Direct reversal enzymes (e.g.\u00a0alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferases and AlkB-family dioxygenases) extract alkyl substituents from the nucleobase to leave the nucleotide and DNA backbone intact, and can remove not only small base modifications, but also inter-strand DNA crosslinks and bulky exocyclic DNA adducts (14\u201316). BER also removes mainly small but also some bulky and crosslinked adducts (17\u201319), and is initiated by DNA glycosylases that liberate a single modified nucleobase from the DNA backbone through hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond (19\u201323). This reaction forms an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP, or abasic) site that is then incised by an AP endonuclease (e.g.\u00a0Exonuclease III (Xth) or Endonuclease IV (EndoIV, Nfo) in bacteria), generating a gap in the DNA backbone. In contrast, the NER pathway removes bulky or duplex-distorting lesions by endonuclease-catalyzed incisions that isolate a lesion-containing DNA oligonucleotide (24,25). DNA gaps generated in BER and NER are processed, filled, and sealed by the action of a DNA polymerase and DNA ligase.", "Recent studies of self-resistance mechanisms against genotoxic natural products revealed that several unrelated glycosylases participate in removing bulky adducts (26,27). Among them, the DNA glycosylase AlkZ, derived from Streptomyces sahachiroi and which resides within the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of the natural product azinomycin B (AZB), repairs interstrand crosslink (ICL) damage generated by AZB (27\u201329). AZB is a bifunctional alkylating agent that forms ICLs in the major groove by linking the N7 nitrogens of purines in the duplex DNA sequence 5\u2032-d(PuNPy)-3\u2032 (30). AlkZ unhooks AZB-ICLs by cleaving the N-glycosidic bonds of both modified nucleotides, resulting in AP sites that can be processed by the BER pathway (Figure 1C) (19,27). The crystal structure revealed that AlkZ adopts a C-shaped structure in which the concave channel contains a Q\u03a6Q motif essential for catalytic activity and a \u03b2-hairpin predicted to contact the lesion in the minor groove (28). AlkZ belongs to the uncharacterized HTH_42 superfamily of proteins widespread in antibiotic producers and pathogenic bacteria (27). To date, the only other bacterial DNA glycosylase characterized as an ICL glycosylase is another HTH_42 protein, Escherichia coli YcaQ, which has a relaxed specificity relative to S. sahachiroi AlkZ and can cleave N7-linked nitrogen mustard (NM) ICLs and N7-methyl-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (7mG) monoadducts (29).", "Figure 1.Structures of TXNs family compounds and genomic analysis of self-resistance determinants TxnU2/U4 and LldU1/U5.

Trioxacarcin A (TXNA) and LL-D49194 (LLD), two of the most representative compounds in the TXN family, intercalate the base pairs of DNA and have reactive epoxide moieties that covalently alkylate the N7 of guanine in d(GT) dinucleotides, forming stable DNA lesions that impair normal cellular processes (35,36). Consequently, TXNA and LLD exhibit remarkable antimalarial, antibacterial and antitumor activity (31,33,34). The TXNA analog gutingimycin (Figure 1A), which contains a TXN skeleton and a guanine (Gua) group, has been isolated from the fermentation broth of a marine Streptomycete (37). Given that TXNA and LLD are alkylating agents that selectively modify deoxyguanosine (G) to form DNA adducts, we speculated that the biosynthetic pathways of the two natural products should contain DNA glycosylases responsible for cleaving TXNA/LLD-DNA, in which gutingimycin and LLD-Gua are the resulting products (Figure 1A). Therefore, we became interested in the DNA damage repair mechanism targeting TXNs family of DNA alkylating agents.", "Herein, we report four DNA glycosylases identified from the TXNs BGC, in which TxnU2/U4 are derived from the TXN BGC (txn, GenBank accession number KP410250) and LldU1/U5 originate from the LLD BGC (lld, GenBank accession number MK501817) (Figure 1B). TxnU2/4 and LldU1/5 belong to the HTH_42 superfamily and are monofunctional DNA glycosylases that excise TXNA- and LLD-DNA adducts, in which TxnU4 and LldU1 play the major roles in toxin resistance. Interestingly, TxnU4 and LldU1 cannot excise N7-methyl or crosslinked G adducts like their homologs AlkZ and YcaQ (28,29), nor can TXNA-DNA lesions be excised by any other alkylpurine DNA glycosylase. Moreover, relative to AlkZ, TxnU4 and LldU1 have a unique catalytic motif that process TXNA- and LLD-DNA lesions differently and that may explain the redundancy for two paralogs in each txn and lld biosynthetic gene cluster. We also show that AP sites derived from TXNA-DNA excision are processed less efficiently than those generated from 7mG depurination, suggesting that the product of TXNA-DNA excision requires a specialized mechanism for repair."]
