["Introduction", "Bacteria living in natural environment face different stress factors (i.e. temperature, salinity, water activity, starvation, competition). Microorganisms exposed to antimicrobial stressors have evolved a variety of specific adaptive and protective mechanisms, which include changes in cell membrane, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, gene expression, biofilm formation, and production of small bioactive molecules [1,2]. In particular small bioactive compounds can shape metabolism and enhance survival of bacterial community in the environment [1].", "The red pigment prodigiosin is produced as a secondary metabolite by many bacterial species [3,4]. It has an antibacterial, antiprotozoal, anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activity [3,5\u20138]. Despite decades of research, the mechanism underlying its antibacterial activity remains poorly explained. It has been demonstrated that prodigiosin inhibits growth of a wide spectrum of Gram positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as Gram negative Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Erwinia carotovora [3,9\u201315]. For a producer to survive it should be self-resistant to prodigiosin. It has been shown that in prodigiosin producing Streptomyces griseoviridis species rphA1 and rphA2 ABC-transporter genes are important for self-resistance [16]. The bacteria that do not have such homologues are prodigiosin sensitive. Prodigiosin as an antibacterial agent has high potential in biotechnological and medical applications [4\u201311], as well as in microbial ecology due to its ability to modulate bacterial ecophysiology [12,17\u201319]. It was shown that prodigiosin impregnated to cellulose matrix effectively removes E. coli and B. cereus from contaminated water [20]. Recently the induction of autolysins in Bacillus subtilis and other Bacillus species has been demonstrated as a potent antibacterial mechanism [15]. Different studies [11,13] reported inhibitory effect of prodigiosin on E. coli. The MIC value of prodigiosin for E. coli MG1655 was determined to be 103.4 \u00b1 6.3 mg L-1 [15], which is moderate compared to some other known E. coli antimicrobial agents [21]. On the other hand, several studies showed no effect of prodigiosin on E. coli cells [22,23]. Because the mechanism of prodigiosin\u00b4s action on E. coli is not known, the conflicting data of prodigiosin antibacterial action are difficult to reconcile. As several ecopysiological roles of prodigiosin have been proposed for bacteria such as air dispersal of bacteria [24], metabolic sink for NAD(P)H or proline [25], storage of light energy [17], anion exchange [18], energy spilling function [26] and UV protection [19], it is possible that antimicrobial activity is not the result of prodigiosin aiming at a single cell target, but in turn may have a pleiotropic effect on E. coli physiology. Many antimicrobial agents are indeed known to have multiple effects on microorganisms [27].", "In this study, the effect of prodigiosin on E. coli physiological behaviour was studied. Different modes of prodigiosin antibacterial activity were tested, including DNA cleavage, induction of SOS response, the effect on cell membrane integrity, metabolic activity, as well as survival of prodigiosin pre-treated cells in media containing different antibiotics. The results indicate a multifaceted physiological response to prodigiosin in E. coli, very different from antimicrobial effect of prodigiosin described in a model bacterium Bacillus subtilis."]
