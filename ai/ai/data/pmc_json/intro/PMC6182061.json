["Introduction", "In recent years, much interest has focused on the development of biorational pesticides with good insecticidal activity and environmental safety. Many active compounds derived from plants, such as azadirachtin, rotenone and nicotine, not only possess superior activity and environmental safety, but also provide lead compounds for biorational pesticides innovation (Petroski and Stanley, 2009; Cantrell et al., 2012). Camptothecin, a natural quinolone alkaloid product, was extracted from the bark of the Chinese tree Camptotheca acuminata by Wall et al. in the early 1960s (Wall and Wani, 1966). During the 1980s, topoisomerase 1 (Top1) has been identified as the target protein of camptothecin (Hsiang et al., 1985). Top1 is involved in the process of cell growth and proliferation, and is needed for DNA replication and transcription (Staker et al., 2002). Its mode of action is to break one of DNA supercoiling double-strands by covalent binding, then making a recombination with the other strand revolving around (Pommier et al., 1998; Redinbo et al., 1998). As an inhibitor, camptothecin could prevent DNA re-ligation by forming a stabilizing ternary composite with Top 1-DNA (Staker et al., 2002). Due to the special mechanism, CPTs present potent anti-tumor or insecticidal activities, and some of them have been commonly used in clinical trials (Broom, 1996; Chabot, 1997). Meanwhile, camptothecin was also used as a potent chemosterilant against the house fly for decades (DeMilo and Borkovec, 1974; Borkovec, 1976). In recent years, various CPTs have been synthesized and exhibited efficient toxicity to Spodoptera exigua, Nilaparvata lugens, Brevicoryne brassicae, Chilo suppressalis, Tetranychus cinnabarinus, Bursaphelenchus xylophilu, and so on (Ma et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). It has been evaluated that 7-substituted analogs demonstrated quite good insecticidal activity (Liu et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2015). Moreover, camptothecin and its mixtures with other effective ingredients exhibited good insecticidal or synergistic activity when were evaluated in the laboratory and field against various insect pests (Sun et al., 2012; Tong and Feng, 2016a,b). Previous works conducted in our lab suggested that camptothecin could induce apoptosis in Spodoptera frugiperda cultured cell line Sf9, and inhibits the Top1 of insect cells by decreasing the ability to relax the negatively supercoiled plasmid pBR322 DNA (Wang et al., 2011; Gong et al., 2014). Similarly, some studies have also shown an identical outcome, which further revealed the key residues involved in the relaxation activity and the apoptosis mechanism related to the mitochondrial pathway (Zhang et al., 2012, 2013, 2017; Ren et al., 2017).", "In order to facilitate the development of new compounds, rational drug design combined with structural biology is the most appropriate potential method (Hoque et al., 2017). Although the crystal structure of human Top1 in complex with the poison topotecan and a covalent complex with DNA duplexes was established in 2002 (Staker et al., 2002), few of researchers has addressed the importance of using this structure to develop new compounds applicable for pest management. Here we cloned the Top1 (Sf Top1) gene from Sf9 cells, built the 3D model for Sf Top1 by homologous modeling, and then illuminated its binding mode with CPTs. We designed and synthesized quite a number of target derivatives based on the binding mode, and assessed the activities in vitro. Furthermore, molecular docking and dynamical simulations studies were applied to clarify the interaction mechanism between CPTs and Sf Top1-DNA complex. Finally, the CPTs' activities against S. litura have also been tested in vivo. All these studies would redound to develop CPTs as new biorational pesticides."]
