["Introduction", "The reduction in crop productivity by 51\u201382% on a global scale is primarily influenced by abiotic stress factors, such as drought, salinity, heat, cold, toxic heavy metals, hypoxia and anoxia, waterlogging, and nutrient imbalance (Cooke and Leishman, 2016; Zahra et al., 2021; Raza et al., 2022). Contemporary climate change notably imparts drought and heat stress, two major abiotic stress factors resulting in crop loss and productivity (Zandalinas et al., 2018). For instance, studies report that about a 40% loss in yield in maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is primarily due to drought stress (Daryanto et al., 2016). Therefore, it is evident that abiotic stress factors are the most severe constraints to global food production, leading to nutritional and food insecurity in the climate-changing era (Del Buono, 2021; Kamenya et al., 2021; Raza, 2022). The last few decades witnessed an increase in the prevalence of abiotic stressors primarily due to unpredictable weather changes induced by global climatic change (Del Buono, 2021; Kamenya et al., 2021; Raza, 2022). Abiotic stressors alter the homeostasis of the physiological, molecular, and biochemical setup of crop plants, such as water relations, nutrient uptake and assimilation, osmotic deregulation, loss of membrane integrity, impairment in enzyme activity, and the most notable decline in photosynthetic efficiency (Moradtalab et al., 2018; Ahanger et al., 2019; Raza, 2021; Raza et al., 2021e). Most of these impairments after exposure to the stress factors are associated with phytohormone production and their transport in underground and aerial parts of plants (Gangwar et al., 2014; Verma et al., 2016; Arif et al., 2021). Moreover, plants primarily respond to these abiotic stressors by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), which, in turn, induce severe damage to the cellular structures, such as biomembranes and organelles (da Silva and Y\u00fccel, 2008; Hasanuzzaman et al., 2020).", "To circumvent these harmful effects, plants respond through physiological and molecular mechanistic adjustments to mitigate the adverse impacts of abiotic stressors (Raza, 2021, 2022). Additionally, the defense response to these abiotic stressors includes synthesis of critical proteins linked to metabolism, activation of signal transduction, and regulatory pathways controlled by the expression of a large number of stress-tolerant genes, which, in turn, are regulated by diverse organic and inorganic molecules (da Silva and Y\u00fccel, 2008; Hasanuzzaman et al., 2020; Raza et al., 2021e). Among inorganic molecules, Si, formally categorized as the non-essential element, has been recently found to defend against the harmful effects of abiotic stressors in crop plants. The uptake of Si results in the activation of a diverse range of critical genes to mitigate stress conditions to regulate plant growth and development. Si is the second most abundant element found in the earth\u2019s crust (Luyckx et al., 2017; Atta et al., 2019; Zargar et al., 2019). Si is crystalline in structure and forms at least two stable oxide forms, viz. Si monoxide (SiO) and silica (SiO2). Average soils contain about 28% Si by weight in silicates, alumina-silicates, and Si dioxide, most of which are unavailable to crop plants. Traces of monosilicic acid found in soil are the only form of Si available to plants (Pereira et al., 2013). A later form of Si is soluble in water and is weakly adsorbed by soil. The transport of Si into aerial parts of crop plants occurs through several specific and non-specific transporters. In several crop plants, such as maize, cucumber, rice, and barley; genes, such as Lsi2, Lsi1, and Lsi6, are responsible for uptake of Si in roots and aerial organs (Wang et al., 2015; Ouellette et al., 2017; Ratcliffe et al., 2017). Among these, Lsi1 and Lsi6 transporters belonging to aquaporins are abundantly distributed in shoot and root tissues, whereas Lsi2, an anion transporter, is found in membranes of root endodermis (Mitani et al., 2011).", "Crop plants may grow well in the absence of Si, although in a few plants, such as rice and horsetail, the absence of Si may make them vulnerable to fungal infections (Law and Exley, 2011). Si has been reported to play numerous roles in mitigating abiotic stress conditions (Coskun et al., 2016; Luyckx et al., 2017; Rasoolizadeh et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019a; Alamri et al., 2020; Salim et al., 2021). For instance, Si mediates diverse strategies to sequester the metal ions by modulating soil pH, metal speciation, co-precipitation, and compartmentalization (Debona et al., 2017). Recent trends have proved the evolution of Si-based fertilizers to impart growth and developmental effects of crop plants, such as enhancing photosynthesis and regulating electrolytic leakage under stress conditions (Chen et al., 2011). For example, Si enhances photosynthesis in mango trees and increases water and nutrient uptake under abiotic stress conditions (Santos et al., 2014). Si is found in almost all the plants in variable amounts, imparting varying physiological effects (Cooke and Leishman, 2011). Apart from its critical role in stress tolerance imposed by excess salt and drought, uptake of Si results in enhanced mechanical support to shoots and leaf blades (Chen et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2019a). Numerous reports reveal the application of Si in mitigating abiotic and biotic stresses in various plant species (Zargar et al., 2019; Gou et al., 2020). Moreover, Si plays a vital role in ameliorating metal toxicity in several crop plants (Chen et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019). Moreover, Si helps to mitigate metal ion stresses like that of aluminum (Al) and manganese (Mn) stress in crop plants (Tripathi et al., 2016). Water uptake through aquaporins and root hydraulic conductance is upregulated by administering exogenous Si (Liu P. et al., 2015). For instance, supplementation of Si in Talh trees (Acacia gerrardii Benth) induces salinity tolerance, possibly through overproduction of glycine betaine and proline to conserve water in tissues, positively regulating metabolic activity (Al-Huqail et al., 2019). Inclusively, Si is critical to plant growth and metabolism under a diverse range of abiotic stress conditions (Figure 1; Song et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2016).", "FIGURE 1Impact of abiotic stress on various aspects of plant growth and defense mechanisms evoked by application of Si.", "Impact of abiotic stress on various aspects of plant growth and defense mechanisms evoked by application of Si.", "Phytohormones play a pivotal role in stress tolerance by modulating a wide range of physiological, cellular, and molecular responses by activating various signal transduction pathways critical to defense mechanisms (Fahad et al., 2015a; Fei et al., 2019; Mubarik et al., 2021; Sabagh et al., 2021). These critical phytohormone-controlled physiological processes during defense include osmotic adjustment, plant-water relations, source/sink transition, the adjustment in photosynthesis, nutrient allocation, and activation of antioxidant defense systems (Miura and Tada, 2014; Khan et al., 2020a). The main phytohormones proven to mitigate the stress conditions through physiological, biochemical, and molecular adjustments include auxin, CK, ETH, GAs, SA, ABA, BRs, and JA (Khan et al., 2020a,b). The levels of phytohormones are reported to be enhanced upon exogenous Si supplementation under abiotic stress conditions (Kim et al., 2016). Considering the beneficial role of Si in alleviating the abiotic stress in crop plants, we believe it is the need of the hour to discuss its clinical properties at the physiological and molecular levels. Against this background, the current review is aimed to provide an in-depth account of the role of Si as a critical element in sustaining plant growth and productivity under abiotic stress conditions. We have also discussed the intervention of Si in triggering the phytohormone synthesis, regulating expression of genes in alleviating the abiotic stress conditions, and detailed the updated account on its role in enhancing growth and metabolism. We believe the current review will pave the way to further open the window of exploring this golden element and its frontline role in attaining global food security."]
