["1 Introduction", "Endophytic fungi are generally recognized as a group of microorganisms that do not cause substantial damage to the host and live harmlessly in healthy plant tissues throughout a certain life cycle stage (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2018). The existence of fungi inside the tissues of healthy plants has been known as early as the late 19th century when endophytic fungi were first successfully isolated from darnel (Lolium temulentum) (Freeman, 1904; Kusari et\u00a0al., 2012). However, plant endophytic fungi had not attracted much attention as a new microbial resource until 1993. When an endophytic fungus, Ceriporiopsis andreanae (basionym Taxomyces andreanae), was isolated from Taxus brevifolia for the production of taxol, which initiated a surge in studies on endophytes (Stierle et al., 1993; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2022). Another excellent anticancer drug, vincristine is originally reported from Catharanthus roseus, endophytic Fusarium oxysporum isolated from this plant can also produce vinblastine and vincristine in appreciable amounts (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2013). The herb Artemisia annua L. is well known for its antimalarial properties and is the source of the antimalarial drug artemisinin (Madsen et\u00a0al., 2010). Extracts of both endophytic Penicillium and Talaromyces isolated from A. annua exhibited significant antimalarial activity (Alhadrami et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, endophytic fungi can produce the same natural products as their host plants. Importantly, microbial fermentation has several advantages over the use of plants for the production of bioactive substances, such as easy-to-operate, reducing the need for plants, and obtaining stronger active drug derivatives by varying the culture conditions (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2013).", "Various endophytic fungi have been employed in recent years to produce bioactive compounds, such as Aspergillus, Epicoccum, Hypoxylon, Induratia, Penicillium, Phoma, Phaeosphaeria, Saccharomycopsis, Sarocladium, Trichoderma, and Wickerhamomyces. The biologically active secondary metabolites deriving from endophytic fungi belong to diverse structural classes. The secondary metabolites include alkaloids, anthraquinones, polyketides, sterols, terpenes, and volatile organic compounds (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2021a). They possess potent antimicrobial, antiviral, insecticidal, antioxidative, antidiabetic, cytotoxic, and anticancer properties (Deshmukh et\u00a0al., 2015; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2019; Fernando et\u00a0al., 2020; Manganyi and Ateba, 2020; Pal et\u00a0al., 2020; Rahaman et\u00a0al., 2020; Agrawal et\u00a0al., 2022). A few endophytic fungi can produce phytohormones to promote the growth of their host plants. And synthesize bioactive compounds to increase the resistance of the plants to environmental stresses. Still, they can also promote the accumulation of secondary metabolites initially produced by the plant, including pharmaceutical ingredients (Jia et\u00a0al., 2016).", "Research on endophytic fungi has become more accessible with the continual advancement of sequencing and omics technologies. Genetics- and genomics-based strategies have emerged as a comprehensive approach to studying natural microbial products (Walker et\u00a0al., 2020). It is possible to elucidate the basic pathways of secondary metabolites isolated from organisms using these technologies. These technologies can facilitate the computational discovery of biosynthetic pathways. Producer strains for biosynthesis are investigated, silenced biosynthetic gene clusters are activated, and synthetic pathways for novel compounds are designed to increase their yields and activity (Sagita et\u00a0al., 2021). Comparative multi-genome analysis significantly improves understanding of the genetic and metabolic diversity of endophytic fungi involved in different host-plant interactions (Ye et\u00a0al., 2017). Additionally, the putative functional characteristics of endophytes can be elucidated by metagenome-based analyses (Gupta et\u00a0al., 2020). The rapid development of omics technologies has accelerated the development of endophytic fungal resources.", "Rosa roxburghii Tratt., a homology of medicine and food, has received considerable attention across many research fields because of its notably high vitamin C. Various phytochemicals extracted from its fruits, roots, and leaves have shown potential antimicrobial activity. When choline chloride with lactic acid or levulinic acid (molar ratio 1:2) as deep eutectic solvents, the extracts of R. roxburghii leaves showed incredible antibacterial activities against the five tested pathogens (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus), with the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.012 to 0.049 mg/mL (Wang et\u00a0al., 2021). Strictinin isomers, separated from the root of this plant, were excellent antimicrobial components, mainly responsible for oxidative stress and protein synthesis disorder (Ma et\u00a0al., 2020). Since R. roxburghii is a botanical source of antimicrobial compounds, it may represent a promising target for screening endophytic fungi with antimicrobial potential. We isolated endophytic fungi from R. roxburghii and screened the most prospective strain by antimicrobial activity assays. Additionally, we investigated the strain\u2019s biosynthetic capacity through genomics, non-targeted metabolomics, and comparative genomics."]
