["Introduction", "Damping-off diseases that kill planted seeds and germinating crops are a global agricultural problem with an urgent need for new, sustainable control measures (Lamichhane et al., 2017). The oomycete Globisporangium ultimum Trow (synonym Pythium ultimum Trow; Uzuhashi et al., 2010) is a member of the Pythium sensu lato complex and causes damping-off and root-rot disease in a diverse range of plants, including Pisum sativum and other agriculturally important legumes (Hendrix and Campbell, 1973). Typically, infection occurs through mycelia or oospores persisting within the soil which then infect seeds and the root system leading to severe wilting, reduced yields, and plant death. This ultimately causes major global economic losses, notably in organic vegetable production (Alcala et al., 2016; Lamichhane et al., 2017). Commercial losses occur as direct costs from damage to the seeds and seedlings, or as indirect costs due to additional replanting and lower yields from delayed sowing times (Lamichhane et al., 2017).", "Management of G. ultimum damping-off disease has mainly relied on the application of chemical pesticides, through soil fumigation or soil drenches; practises that are now being withdrawn due to their detrimental effects on the environment, human health, and the development of pesticide-resistant strains (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016; Lamichhane et al., 2017). Therefore, finding novel disease management strategies and agents with less impact on the environment is of major importance, and also required to meet international objectives for environmental sustainability (Hulot and Hiller, 2021). Biological control of damping-off disease using naturally occurring antagonistic bacteria (biopesticides) is one such approach. The environmentally friendly potential of microbial biopesticides has led to a renewed interest in these disease control approaches (Fira et al., 2018; Mullins et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2021). Several rhizosphere-colonising bacterial genera are capable of protecting their host plant from damping-off caused by Pythium sensu lato, including Pseudomonas (Gravel et al., 2005), Streptomyces (Punja and Yip, 2003), Bacillus (Fira et al., 2018), Pantoea (Bardin et al., 2003), and Burkholderia (Mao et al., 1997; Parke and Gurian-Sherman, 2001). Efficacy of biological control of damping-off has been demonstrated for several important crop species at a variety of scales, from laboratory models to commercial agricultural use (Lamichhane et al., 2017).", "Recently, it was demonstrated that historically effective Burkholderia biopesticides (Parke and Gurian-Sherman, 2001), specifically the species Burkholderia ambifaria protected Pisum sativum seedlings against damping-off disease by G. ultimum through the production of the antimicrobial polyyne metabolite, cepacin A (Mullins et al., 2019). Polyynes are compounds with alternating triple and single carbon\u2013carbon bonds that have attracted considerable interest because of their unusual structure, high reactivity, and antimicrobial properties (Ross et al., 2014). Multiple bacterial polyynes (Figure 1) have been discovered. They have been shown to have potent biological activities, including the antibacterial and antioomycete properties of cepacins (Parker et al., 1984; Mullins et al., 2019), the antibacterial activity of caryoynencin from Trinickia caryophylli (formerly Burkholderia caryophylli) (Kusumi et al., 1987; Ross et al., 2014), the antifungal properties of collimonins and massilins from Collimonas fungivorans and Massilia sp. YMA4, respectively (Fritsche et al., 2014; Kai et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2022), and the algicidal (Hotter et al., 2021) and antioomycete (Murata et al., 2021) activities of protegencin from Pseudomonas protegens (Mullins et al., 2021). Additionally, caryoynencin, together with other antimicrobial Burkholderia gladioli metabolites, has also been implicated in the ecological role of safe-guarding Lagriinae beetle eggs from attack by fungal pathogens (Fl\u00f3rez et al., 2017).", "Figure 1The core biosynthetic gene cluster, evolutionary relationships and polyynes produced by the bacteria evaluated for their ability to control damping-off disease.

However, they are also human and plant pathogens, and in the absence of further understanding of their safety and bioactive mechanism, these concerns have restricted their exploitation as biocontrol agents (Eberl and Vandamme, 2016). We explored the capacity of Burkholderia and other polyyne-producing bacteria to protect Pisum sativum (peas) from damping-off disease caused by G. ultimum. Polyynes are inherently unstable and light-sensitive (Ross et al., 2014; Kai et al., 2018; Petrova et al., 2022) and direct delivery to the rhizosphere via bacterial seedcoats is required for biopesticidal efficacy (Mullins et al., 2019). A panel of 30 bacteria shown to encode a polyyne biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by genome mining (Figure 1; Mullins et al., 2021) was assembled and comprised of Burkholderia (7 species, 26 strains), Pseudomonas protegens (2 strains), Trinickia caryophylli and Collimonas fungivorans (1 strain each). The collection was assessed for antagonistic activity through in vitro antimicrobial assays, the production of polyynes and other compounds by metabolite analyses. The strains were subsequently tested within a Pisum sativum biological control assay for G. ultimum damping-off. The study expands the evidence that cepacin A production by some B. ambifaria strains protects pea plants from G. ultimum (Mullins et al., 2019), and uniquely highlights that other polyynes, such as caryoynencin, can be harnessed for the same biological control function. We also uniquely demonstrate that Burkholderia species such as B. gladioli and B. plantarii, more associated with plant-pathogenic traits (Maeda et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2021), initially form protective associations with germinating plants, in contrast to the opportunistic disease they may elicit on mature or damaged hosts."]
