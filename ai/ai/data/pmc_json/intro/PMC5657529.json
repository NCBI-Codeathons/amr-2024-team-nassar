["INTRODUCTION", "A large number of environmental toxins, chemotherapeutic drugs, and cellular metabolites, including those used by microbes as defense mechanisms, are alkylating agents that generate a chemically diverse spectrum of modifications on both the phosphodeoxyribose backbone and the nucleobases of DNA1. These lesions are both mutagenic and cytotoxic as a result of their ability to mistemplate or block nucleotide incorporation during transcription and replication. The majority of alkylation damage is eliminated from the genome by two excision repair pathways. Bulky and/or helix-distorting lesions are removed through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway2,3. In prokaryotes, NER is initiated by the UvrABC incision complex, which isolates the damage within a 12-nucleotide segment that is subsequently replaced with undamaged DNA by helicase, polymerase, and ligase activities. Conversely, small nucleobase modifications are removed by the base excision repair (BER) pathway4,5, which is initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases that hydrolyze the N-glycosidic bond linking the damaged nucleobase to the backbone. The resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site is processed by endonuclease, exonuclease, polymerase, and ligase activities. Unlike the UvrABC complex, which acts on a broad spectrum of bulky lesions, DNA glycosylases are each specific for a limited number of small lesions6.", "The size of the lesions repaired by BER is limited by the DNA glycosylases that initiate the pathway. These enzymes typically employ a base-flipping mechanism to extrude the modified nucleobase from the DNA duplex in order to capture it inside a nucleobase binding pocket on the surface of the protein6\u20138. This binding pocket allows for damage recognition through shape and charge complementary with the modified nucleobase, while also providing a scaffold for residues that catalyze hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond. Importantly, the nucleobase binding pocket also imposes a steric limit on the size of the lesions that can be excised by DNA glycosylases.", "We recently discovered that the DNA glycosylase AlkD from Bacillus cereus excises cationic N3- and N7-alkylpurine lesions exclusively through contacts with the phosphodeoxyribose backbone, while leaving the modified nucleobase stacked in the duplex9. This unique mechanism eliminates the steric constraints of a nucleobase binding pocket and allows AlkD to excise bulky alkylpurine adducts that are refractory to removal by base-flipping DNA glycosylases9,10. Furthermore, we showed that this ability extends to adducts produced by yatakemycin (YTM), a 680-Da alkylating agent belonging to the spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone family of natural products, which includes CC-1065, duocarmycin A, and duocarmycin SA11\u201314 (Fig. 1). This discovery suggested that excision of 3-yatakemycinyl-2\u2032-deoxyadenosine (YTMA) lesions is a general feature of DNA glycosylases in the AlkD family, contradicting the original report that YtkR2, an ortholog of AlkD (26% identity and 48% similarity) from the YTM-producer Streptomyces sp. TP-A0356, had uniquely evolved to provide self-resistance to YTM15.", "YTM, CC-1065, and the duocarmycins are extraordinarily potent antimicrobial and antitumor drugs12\u201314,16. These bulky alkylating agents preferentially bind in the deeper, narrower minor groove of AT-rich regions of DNA and undergo DNA binding-induced activation of the spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone moiety to form covalent adducts at N3 of adenine17\u201321. The resultant lesions provide a striking degree of stabilization to the DNA duplex, and have been shown to severely hinder transcription and replication22. Moreover, the stability that these bulky adducts impart has been postulated to account for the ineffectiveness with which they are removed by the NER pathway22,23. However, the cause of this increased duplex stability has not been convincingly explained.", "We now provide a molecular basis for the efficacy of YTM and related drugs through an examination of the YTMA lesion and its thermodynamic and structural effects on DNA, as well as its recognition and repair by AlkD. YTM adducts impart a remarkable stabilization to the DNA duplex through a network of CH/\u03c0 interactions between the YTM moiety and the deoxyribose groups of the surrounding nucleotides. This stabilization is likely responsible for both the slow spontaneous depurination of YTMA lesions and the apparent difficulty with which these lesions are repaired by the NER pathway. Remodeling of YTMA-DNA by AlkD, however, disrupts the CH/\u03c0 interactions involving the modified strand and provides a water nucleophile access to the N-glycosidic bond. The catalytic power of AlkD is underscored by rapid excision of YTMA lesions under single-turnover conditions and substantial retention of enzyme activity for a substrate analog that abrogates the activity of other DNA glycosylases. Surprisingly, the combined activities of AlkD-mediated BER and NER provide only weak protection against YTM toxicity in cells. We attribute this low level of resistance to the extreme stability of the YTMA-DNA substrate and a deleterious persistence of the AlkD/AP-DNA product complex. We discuss structural differences between YtkR2 and AlkD that would alleviate product inhibition by YtkR2, providing the producing strain with effective self-resistance against YTM toxicity."]
