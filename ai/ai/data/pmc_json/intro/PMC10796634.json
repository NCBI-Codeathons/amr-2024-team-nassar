["Introduction", "In nature, plants deploy an enormous array of secondary metabolites to defend against pathogens and herbivores1. These defensive metabolites can be classified into two broad categories: constitutive defence metabolites (phytoanticipins), which act directly on pathogens or herbivores, and inducible defence compounds (phytoalexins), which are specifically produced in response to aggressors2. Compared with constitutive defence, inducible defence is more energetically economical and plays an essential role in plant chemical defence3. The specialized metabolites in inducible defence are usually toxic to the plant, pathogens, or herbivores. Accordingly, plants have evolved two-component chemical defence systems that prevent autotoxicity to help balance plant growth and defence needs1. For instance, defence compounds are often stored in a non-active glycosylated form1,4. In addition to protecting plants from autotoxicity, glycosylation increases the solubility of defence compounds, thereby facilitating their storage, typically in vacuoles5. Upon plant cell damage caused by herbivory or pathogen invasion, glycosylated compounds can be selectively hydrolyzed at glycosidic linkages, yielding toxic defence compounds6. This hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by \u03b2-glycosidase, which is spatially separated from its substrates under physiological conditions but encounters them upon tissue damage. Thus, this two-component chemical defence system comprises glycosylated defence compounds and corresponding \u03b2-glycosidases and provides an immediate chemical response against herbivores or pathogens7. Although \u03b2-glycosidases have been shown to play a decisive role in the chemical defence of various plants, these enzymes have not yet been reported in Panax species.", "The genus Panax in the taxonomic family Araliaceae encompasses several important ginseng species with high medicinal and economic value, including Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen (Notoginseng), Panax ginseng C.A. Mey (Asian Ginseng) and Panax quinquefolium L. (American Ginseng)8,9. The cultivation of P. notoginseng is primarily restricted to southern China; the roots of this species are highly valued for their use in the prevention and treatment of diverse hematological diseases and ischemic cardiovascular diseases10\u201312. P. notoginseng is highly sensitive to sunlight and requires shady, warm, damp environments for growth13. These stringent requirements for cultivation and long harvest cycles increase the vulnerability of the plant to pathogen infection. Over 20 foliar and root diseases that affect P. notoginseng growth have been identified, including round spots caused by Mycocentrospora acerina, black spots caused by Alternaria panax, and rotten roots caused by Fusarium oxysporum. These fungal diseases greatly threaten the quality and production of P. notoginseng and severely hinder the sustainable development of its industry. During evolution, P. notoginseng deploys an enormous array of specialized secondary metabolites that help them solve pathogen attacks. Dammarane triterpenoid saponins with 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) and 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PPT) aglycon moieties, referred to as ginsenosides, perform defensive functions in plants14 and are also the main pharmacological components of P. notoginseng15. These ginsenosides are distributed in various parts of P. notoginseng plants, such as rhizomes, roots, leaves, inflorescences, and infructescences16,17. The ginsenosides Rc, Rb2, and Rb3, classified as the PPD type ginsenosides, are the main chemical components of P. notoginseng leaves (PNLs) but are present at trace levels in the roots16,17. Our previous studies have shown that the main ginsenosides in PNLs, which have a common \u03b2-1,2-glucosidic linkage at the C-3 site, can be entirely hydrolyzed to form corresponding rare ginsenosides by selectively removing one outer glucose residue during ultrasonic extraction in water, and this ginsenoside hydrolysis has been speculatively attributed to a ginsenoside-hydrolyzing glucosidase present in PNLs10,18. However, the \u03b2-glucosidase responsible for this reaction and its role in plant chemical defence is largely unknown.", "Herein, we provide evidence demonstrating the existence of a two-component chemical defence system in P. notoginseng. PnGH1, a \u03b2-glucosidase localized to the chloroplast, was discovered to specifically hydrolyze PPD ginsenosides in PNLs by selectively removing one outer glucose residue at the C-3 site. Due to spatial separation between \u03b2-glucosidase and its substrates in cells, ginsenoside hydrolysis was triggered only upon chloroplast disruption caused by the induced exoenzymes of pathogens. Compared to the non-hydrolyzed substrates, the hydrolysis products exhibited more potent inhibition of pathogen growth both in vitro and in vivo. Similar \u03b2-glucosidase-mediated ginsenoside hydrolysis was found in congeneric species upon fungal infection, including in P. ginseng and P. quinquefolium."]
