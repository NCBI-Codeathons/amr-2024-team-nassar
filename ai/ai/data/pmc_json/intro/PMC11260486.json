["Introduction", "The bacterial class Actinomycetia (recently reclassified as Actinobacteria) is hugely successful, with species commonly inhabiting a wide range of niches, both host-associated and environmental. Environmental Actinomycetia species, especially those inhabiting soil, often have a complex biology and a filamentous growth pattern, which makes laboratory studies difficult.", "In the past century, there has been great scientific interest surrounding the class Actinomycetia. Many essential medicines such as antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline, erythromycin and vancomycin), immunosuppressants (e.g. rapamycin), anthelmintics (e.g. avermectin), and anticancer drugs (e.g. actinomycin D and daunorubicin), but also important insecticides (e.g. spinosyns) and food preservatives (e.g. \u03f5-polylysine) either directly come from or are derivatives of compounds produced by Actinomycetia strains (1,2).", "The biosynthesis of these natural products, often referred to as secondary or specialized metabolites, is encoded in genomic regions called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). These BGCs code for a variety of enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of highly complex chemicals from \u2018simple\u2019 precursors from primary metabolism. In addition to the biosynthetic function, the BGCs often also contain genes for regulation (3), molecular transport/export (4)\u00a0and self-resistance (5). Due to a high degree of conservation of the key enzymatic steps in the biosynthesis of these specialized metabolites, regions of the genome encoding such BGCs can be identified and annotated using bioinformatics tools such as antiSMASH (6), which classifies a BGC based on a set of rules specific to each BGC type (7). AntiSMASH then compares the identified BGC to both known specialized metabolite pathways and existing genomic sequences, and suggests possible precursors. These features have established genome mining as a complementary approach to the bioactivity and compound-centered discovery of novel bioactive molecules (8). As some of these BGCs, such as the gargantulide BGC (9), have sizes of >200 kb, high quality genome assemblies have a strong influence on the quality of the genome mining analyses, as contiguous sequence data allows the identification of complete gene clusters and not just fragments\u2014a challenge that is prevalent with low to medium quality draft genome and many metagenomic datasets (10).", "Most bacterial genomes consist of a single circular chromosome and maybe some smaller circular plasmids. Some genera of the Actinomycetia also have circular chromosomes, but members of the genus Streptomyces have large, linear genomes, similar to how most eukaryotic genomes are organized. The linear Streptomyces genome is usually capped with terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) (11), which can be >1 Mb long and can encode BGCs (e.g. (12)). The TIRs contain short telomeres which are capped with covalently bound terminal proteins (13). The TIRs are highly dynamic and have been speculated to play a role in gene dose modulation by duplicating genomic regions, thereby potentially increasing compound production or diversity if BGCs are duplicated (14). The TIRs also present a special challenge in genome assembly, as even long read information regularly is not of sufficient length to cover the TIR from the chromosome start to the most terminal non-repeat regions. However, because of the repetitive nature, it is still possible to resolve TIRs and generate complete genome sequences. Information about telomeres, TIRs and chromosome arms is not a commonly recorded statistic for bacterial genome assemblies. It is possible that the duplicate TIRs are missing, placed on their own contig, or otherwise misrepresented in otherwise complete genome sequences of Streptomyces isolates in public databases, as large scale errors relating to the TIRs are often observed artifacts introduced by sequence assembly software optimized for circular bacterial genomes. The linear Streptomyces genome is widely hypothesized to be composed of a central \u2018core\u2019, where the basic cellular functions are encoded, and distal \u2018arms\u2019, which are dynamic and more likely to encode BGCs and accessory functions and often contain mobile genetic elements. Several studies have reported this genomic compartmentalization in smaller datasets (15) or using e.g. rRNA genes to mark the core region (16).", "Previously, the high GC content (65\u201375%) of many Actinomycetia species hampered the ability to sequence complete genomes. But with the advent of the GC-agnostic nanopore sequencing technology (17), and implementation of lab protocols minimizing GC bias from illumina sequences (18), high GC-content is less of an obstacle. It is now possible to obtain complete genomes using technologies such as PacBio or Nanopore DNA sequencing, but currently available genomic resources are still too scarce to cover the biological diversity of Actinomycetia in nature (19), and large-scale efforts are often focused on quantity over completeness and chromosomal organization of the individual genome. In a recent massive collaborative study involving both the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DMSZ), the lack of high-quality resources was suggested to severely limit both the biological understanding of Actinomycetia species and the development of new bioactive compounds from this clade (19).", "We report the whole genome sequencing of 1034 Actinomycetia strains from the New Bioactive Compounds (NBC) Collection of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability at the Technical University of Denmark; 881 strains with complete genomes and 153 near-complete genomes. We provide analysis of their phylogeny, genomic organization, BGC content and provide an example of how this large dataset can be used to identify novel BGCs."]
