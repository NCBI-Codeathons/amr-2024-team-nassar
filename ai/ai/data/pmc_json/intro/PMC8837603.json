["Introduction", "Biologically active bacterial metabolites have been a principal source of inspiration for the development of diverse small molecule therapeutics1\u20134. A key role for synthetic chemistry in this discovery process is the total synthesis and synthetic derivatization of natural products that have been physically isolated and structurally characterized from bacterial fermentation broths. The focus on physically characterized structures significantly limits the use of synthetic chemistry in the study of natural chemical diversity as most natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are not expressed (i.e., silent) in the laboratory; and therefore the metabolites they encode remain a mystery. We believe that, in a growing number of instances, the ability to bioinformatically predict the output of a BGC has developed to the extent where the chemical synthesis of a bioinformatically predicted structure (i.e., a synthetic-Bioinformatic Natural Product or syn-BNP)5,6 now provides an alternative, purely in vitro method for converting the genetic information encoded in a BGC into a bioactive small molecule. The application of total synthesis methods to bioinformatically predicted small molecules provides an opportunity for synthetic chemistry to enter the natural product discovery pipeline at a much earlier phase. By focusing on the synthesis of previously inaccessible natural structures instead of already discovered natural products, synthetic chemistry could significantly expand its impact on the natural products drug discovery process.", "Uncovering unexploited biosynthetic diversity is key to the identification of BGCs whose bioinformatic structure predictions can serve as appealing starting points for the total synthesis of bioactive syn-BNPs. One of the most common mechanisms by which bacteria generate biologically active small molecules is the polymerization of alpha amino acids using non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs)7. The recent discovery of two structurally related antibiotics, albicidin and cystobactamid8,9, that arise from NRPSs that polymerize \u03c1-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) monomers suggests that bacteria might produce a previously undiscovered collection of bioactive metabolites using an alternative substrate polymerization strategy than has been seen in most NRPS derived natural products characterized to date. Publicly available sequenced bacterial genomes do not appear to contain PABA polymerizing BGCs beyond those that are predicted to encode albicidin or cystobactamid. As the majority of environmental bacteria are still not readily cultured in the laboratory, we postulated that PABA polymerizing BGCs might be more commonly associated with the uncultured bacteria present in the environment.", "Here we track PABA specific adenylation (A) domain sequences in soil metagenomic libraries and find that NRPS BGCs that are predicted to utilize PABA are common in these environments. Detailed bioinformatic analysis of one such BGC, the lap BGC, predicted that it encodes an N-acylated mixed PABA thiazole-based structure. Total chemical synthesis of the bioinformatically predicted lap BGC product gave a syn-BNP that we have called lapcin. Lapcin is a potent dual topoisomerase I/II inhibitor that shows low nM to pM cytotoxicity against diverse cancer cell lines and represents a distinct structural class of topoisomerase inhibitors. The discovery of lapcin represents a compelling, structurally complex, example of the potential power of linking synthetic chemistry and bioinformatics to unlock the biosynthetic instructions hidden in complex silent BGCs. Furthermore, this work shows that coupling metagenome BGC discovery methods with a syn-BNP approach provides a method for circumventing difficulties associated with both culturing bacteria and activating BGCs, two key bottlenecks that have hampered the discovery of bioactive small molecules encoded by many bacterial BGCs."]
