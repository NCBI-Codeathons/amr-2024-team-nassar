["INTRODUCTION", "Due to the continuous increase of drug-resistant bacteria, antibiotic resistance is regarded as a global public health threat (1). The lack of new antibiotics with novel modes of action in the current drug development pipeline, makes finding new compounds to fight off resistant pathogens a critical task (2). Since the discovery of penicillin, secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by various living organisms have been foundational to the development of antimicrobial drugs (3). The majority of antibiotic compounds are isolated as natural products, from fungi and bacteria (4). For many decades, screening biological samples for desired bioactivity has been the traditional methodology for natural product discovery (5). Due to the high rediscovery rates and labor-intensive nature of the process, in silico methods have become a promising way to guide modern drug discovery efforts (6,7). Gene-centered methods, such as genome mining, enable researchers nowadays to computationally detect the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of antibiotics and predict encoded compounds (8). Over the last decade, greatly improved genome mining tools such as antiSMASH (9), EvoMining (10), PRISM (11) or DeepBGC (12) use methods like Hidden Markov Models, phylogeny or deep learning to highlight a variety of natural product classes. Combined with databases such as MIBiG (13), Natural Product Atlas (14) and the antiSMASH database (15), these tools allow for fast and efficient mining and dereplication of thousands of bacterial genomes and BGCs. According to the latest version of the Atlas of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (16) there currently are \u223c400 000 predicted BGCs sequenced. Moreover, <1% of total clusters are experimentally verified, which leads to an important question: Which of these clusters should be further examined with wet lab experiments?", "Recently, researchers adopted a prioritization approach for antibiotic discovery that is based on the observation that antibiotic producers have to be resistant against their own products to avoid suicide (17). This so called target-directed or self resistance based genome mining approach allows the prediction of the mode of action of the encoded compound of an uncharacterized BGC based on resistance genes, in some cases co-located within the antibiotic BGC (18). Multiple resistance mechanisms exist, such as inactivation and export of antibiotics as well as target modification. In the latter case, a duplicated and antibiotic-resistant homologue of an essential housekeeping gene is detectable within the antibiotic BGC and allows the prediction of the mode of action of the encoded compound even without knowing a chemical structure (19\u201321). Moore et\u00a0al., for example, were able to identify a fatty acid synthase inhibiting antibiotic by screening for duplicated fatty acid synthase genes within orphan BGCs (22).", "In 2017, we introduced the first version of the \u2018Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker\u2019 (ARTS) (23), a user-friendly web server that automates target-directed genome mining to prioritize promising strains that produce antibiotics with new mode of actions. Since a resistant copy of the antibiotic target gene is typically detectable in the genome, can be observed within the BGC of the antibiotic and horizontally acquired with the BGC (23), ARTS automatically detects possible resistant housekeeping genes based on three criteria: duplication, localization within a biosynthetic gene cluster, and evidence of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). One previous limitation of the ARTS pipeline was its focus on actinobacterial genomes. Although natural product discovery historically was highly focusing on the phylum Actinobacteria, prominent families from other phyla such as Proteobacteria or Firmicutes are known to have high natural product biosynthetic potential (24\u201326). Here, we introduce a greatly improved version 2 of the ARTS webserver, now allowing the analysis of the entire kingdom of bacteria, metagenomic data, and the comparison of multiple genomes. This update therefore will facilitate natural product prioritization and antibiotic discovery efforts beyond actinomycetes."]
