["Introduction", "The purpose of this work is to identify genes encoding hypothetical proteins that may play a role in resistance of Cercospora fungi to the photoactivated toxin cercosporin produced by these fungi for infection of host plants. Cercospora species cause leaf spot and blight diseases on many major crops including corn, soybean, sugar beet, and coffee, leading to significant crop losses world-wide. One of the reasons for the success of these pathogens is their production of cercosporin, a photoactivated perylenequinone toxin [1]. Mutants deficient in cercosporin production are significantly less virulent on their host plants, thus engineering cercosporin-resistant crop plants via expression of cercosporin resistance genes may be an ecologically friendly method for controlling these damaging diseases.", "Our work has focused on identifying cercosporin-autoresistance genes from Cercospora species, as cercosporin is almost universally toxic to cells due to its production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2]. In the light, cercosporin is converted to an energetically activated triplet state, which reacts with oxygen, generating ROS including singlet oxygen (1O2), a highly toxic species of ROS. Unlike free-radical forms of ROS that are components of cellular metabolism and for which defense mechanisms are understood, cellular resistance to 1O2 is not well characterized [2], and cercosporin is toxic to mice, bacteria, and many fungi in addition to host and non-host plants. During disease development, production of 1O2 and other ROS leads to peroxidation of cell membrane lipids in host plants and can also damage nucleic acids, proteins and lipids in the target cells [1]. Cercospora fungi are immune to cercosporin toxicity, thus they may be a source of genes for engineering crop resistance [3], and also serve as a model for understanding cellular resistance to 1O2.", "Characterization of C. nicotianae mutants selected for sensitivity to cercosporin [4,5] led to the discovery of the zinc cluster transcription factor CRG1 (cercosporin resistance gene 1) [6] required for autoresistance to cercosporin. To identify putative resistance genes, a subtractive cDNA library was generated between the C. nicotianae wild type and a crg1 mutant [7]. From the library, 185 differentially regulated expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found that are candidate resistance genes. The ESTs were classified into functional categories based on their homology to known sequences. These functional categories include ones known to be involved in cercosporin resistance including reductases [8], antioxidants and quenchers of ROS [9], and membrane transporters [10\u201313]. Several of the library genes have been characterized for their role in cercosporin resistance. For example, two genes encoding transporters in the library, CnATR1 and CnCFP, were determined to have an important role in resistance [10,12] as disruption of either of these genes in Cercospora species caused the disruptant strains to be sensitive to cercosporin. In addition, tobacco transformed to express CFP showed significantly reduced lesion size after inoculation with C. nicotianae, confirming a role in resistance and suggesting that CFP might be useful for engineering plants for disease resistance [14]. In the case of ROS quenchers, vitamin B6 was shown to quench 1O2 and be involved in defense against cercosporin [9,15]. Studies to engineer tobacco to constitutively express C. nicotianae B6 biosynthetic genes (PDX1 and PDX2), however, resulted in no statistically significant increase in levels of the B6 vitamers, due to heavy regulation of these genes in plants [16]. Although antioxidants have been implicated in cercosporin resistance [2], a recent study of a gene encoding glutathione S-transferase from the library failed to demonstrate a link with cercosporin resistance [17].", "In addition to genes that were categorized into defined functional categories, the library contains genes encoding hypothetical proteins whose functions are not yet characterized. Most studies of cellular resistance to 1O2 have been done with photosynthetic organisms, as 1O2 is a byproduct of photosynthesis [2]. In Rhodobacter sphaeroides, a model for studies of 1O2 resistance, resistance is associated with protein synthesis and turnover, amino acid metabolism, and glutathione-dependent and\u2013independent detoxification pathways, among others [2]. A recent study comparing putative resistance genes from our Cercospora subtractive library with orthologs identified in transcriptional studies of Rhodobacter\n1O2 resistance, however, showed little commonality between the two species [17]. Thus Cercospora fungi must have unique mechanisms not common to photosynthetic organisms. We thus chose to investigate the library genes encoding hypothetical proteins as possible novel sources of cercosporin and 1O2 resistance."]
