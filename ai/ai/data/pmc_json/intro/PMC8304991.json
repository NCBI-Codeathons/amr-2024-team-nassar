["1. Introduction", "Biofilm is the aggregation of microorganisms in which cells are frequently embedded in a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) that are adherent to each other and/or a surface [1]. These EPSs are mainly polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that provide mechanical stability of biofilms and form a three-dimensional polymer network that interconnects and immobilizes biofilm cells [2]. A bacterial biofilm is an emergent form of life based on an EPS matrix representing a protected mode for bacterial cells, which exhibit a set of characteristic features such as desiccation tolerance, resource capture, social cooperation and antimicrobial resistance [3]. Biofilm formation is a complex process involving multiple steps, including initial attachment, accumulation, maturation and dispersion [4].", "Bifidobacteria, particularly Bifidobacterium bifidum, are believed to be the first colonizers of the human gastrointestinal tract; they can form biofilms on mucosa and food residues in the gut lumen [5]. The ability of various strains of Bifidobacterium to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces, such as glass, stainless steel, polystyrene and complex food matrices, has been well documented [6,7,8]. Environmental stresses, including oxidative stress, bile, low pH value and nutrient starvation, can induce bacterial biofilm formation [9]. Oxygen exposure causes changes in fatty acids in the bifidobacteria cells and an extension of the lag phase of growth; the cells become elongated and develop a rough surface with many nodes due to abnormal or incomplete cell division, and the oxygen-tolerant bifidobacteria seem to defend against oxygen stress through the increase in the content of short fatty acids and cyclopropane fatty acids and the induction of an oxygen stress protein [10]. Transcriptomic analysis of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum BBMN68 in response to oxidative shock reveals that 3% oxygen treatment can cause oxidative stress, which contributes to biofilm formation [11]. High concentrations of bile (0.5% and above) may lyse bifidobacterial cells, leading to the release of intracellular signals such as oligopeptides or autoinducer-2 (AI-2) to trigger quorum sensing; extracellular DNA released from lysed cells may also coat the surface and result in additional electrostatic interactions, allowing the adherence of bifidobacteria [12].", "Metabolomic analysis has been widely applied to study bacterial biofilm, providing information on metabolic state during biofilm formation [13,14]. The metabolomic results of Helicobacter pylori presented as two distinctly different groups: low-biofilm-formers produced more metabolites than high-biofilm-formers [13]. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis reveals biological and metabolic processes essential for Candida albicans biofilm growth [15]. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that the metabolic state of B. bifidum in the biofilm and planktonic states were different, mainly in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; arginine and proline metabolism; citrate cycle and nitrogen metabolism; and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis (serves as a major component of biofilm matrix) [16]. The beneficial effects of probiotic biofilms, especially those of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, have gained special interest from academia and the food industry [7,8,17].", "The aim of this study was to identify the key genes and metabolites involved in B. bifidum biofilm formation. Here, we established a bifidobacterial biofilm fermentation system that contains wheat fiber (WF) as a carrier and combined a time series transcriptome sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis of both biofilm and planktonic cells. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to observe the biofilm cell morphology and extracellular matrix. Our analysis provides insights into the mechanism of bifidobacterial biofilm formation."]
