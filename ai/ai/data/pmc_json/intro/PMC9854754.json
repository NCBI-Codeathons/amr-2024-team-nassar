["1. Introduction", "Thousands of secondary metabolites (also named specialized metabolites) are synthesized by plants, fungi, and bacteria [1]. These metabolites show an impressive variety of chemical structures and have relevant biological roles in nature. Many of them show important pharmacological activities and are widely used in human and animal medicine [2,3]. This enormous variety of secondary metabolites is derived from a few dozen intermediates of the primary metabolism [4]. Several families of secondary metabolites arise from the basic amino acid lysine and ornithine and from intermediates or derivatives of the biosynthetic pathway of these two amino acids. Recent advances in the protein chemistry, molecular genetics, and biochemistry of lysine- and ornithine-derived compounds provide the basis for a better understanding of the pathways that supply precursors and intermediates for the biosynthesis of bioactive metabolites.", "L-Lysine is an important basic amino acid that is synthesized in plants, fungi, and bacteria but is essential in humans and other mammals, which are unable to synthesize it and need to acquire it in their diet. However, it is well established that lysine is catabolized in mammals by the reverse of the final steps of the \u03b1-aminoadipate pathway that converts lysine into saccharopine (N6-glutaryl-L-lysine) and \u03b1-aminoadipate semialdehyde into different tissues: semialdehyde in bovine and primate liver and human placenta.", "L-lysine is formed by three distinct pathways in different living beings. Plants, algae, and bacteria synthesize lysine from aspartic acid by the diaminopimelate pathway, whereas yeasts and filamentous fungi (except some lower fungi) use the \u03b1-aminoadipic acid (\u03b1-AAA) pathway, which starts from homocitrate [5,6]. Both pathways are shown in Figure 1A,B. Remarkably, in the last decades, it has been found that some thermophilic eubacteria, such as Thermus thermophilus [7,8,9], and archaea, e.g., Sulfolobus acidocaldarius [10] and Thermococcus kodakarensis [11], synthesize lysine by a modified \u03b1-aminoadipate pathway rather than the classical bacterial diaminopimelate pathway [12,13]. In this eubacterium and in archaea, the first half of the lysine biosynthesis pathway, up to \u03b1-AAA, follows the same steps as the fungal lysine pathway; in the second half of the pathway, the \u03b1-aminoadipate is converted into lysine through five steps that are similar to the initial steps of the arginine pathway leading from glutamic acid to ornithine (Figure 1C) using the same enzymes of the arginine pathway.", "Lysine and its derivatives are critically important in the biosynthesis of many different secondary metabolites with antibiotic, immunosuppressant, antifungal, antitumor, and neuroprotective activities, among others. Similarly, ornithine derivatives are key components in the biosynthesis of bacterial and fungal siderophores. Many genes involved in the biosynthesis of lysine- and ornithine-derived secondary metabolites have been discovered but there is a lack of information on the correlation of the early enzyme studies and the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms provided by the genome sequencing and other omics tools.", "Lysine biosynthetic reactions result in the formation of important intermediates such as \u03b1-AAA and \u03b1-aminoadipate semialdehyde, involved in the biosynthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [14]; moreover, lysine catabolic reactions form lysine derivatives such as saccharopine, pipecolic acid, and \u03b1-aminoadipate semialdehyde (Figure 2). These intermediates are interconverted, as will be detailed below. Pipecolic acid is a precursor of the antifungal and antitumoral compounds swainsonine and slaframine and of the immunosuppressants rapamycin, tacrolimus, and immunomycin. In addition, the pipecolic acid derivative N-hydroxypipecolic acid serves as an inducer of plant resistance to infections by pathogens. Suitable knowledge of the biosynthesis and availability of these precursors and intermediates is essential to developing new strategies in the search for novel bioactive metabolites. The lysine biosynthesis pathway in bacteria is also involved in the formation of DL-diaminopimelate, required in cell wall formation, and therefore, this pathway has been the subject of intense interest in the search for new antibiotics active against cell wall formation or remodeling, e.g., novel \u03b2-lactams and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors [15]. In addition, the fungal \u03b1-AAA pathway, which does not exist in mammals, has been investigated in search of novel antifungal agents [16].", "In this article, we review the available information on the molecular genetics and biochemistry of the biosynthesis of different precursors of secondary metabolites (Table 1), including novel data obtained from bioinformatic studies. The focus of this article is the analysis of secondary metabolites precursors in well-known model filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Penicillium chrysogenum, and actinobacteria, including Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces clavuligerus, and Streptomyces pristinaespiralis; this knowledge in model organisms is then compared with the information available in other filamentous fungi and bacteria. We describe first the molecular mechanisms related to the biosynthesis of lysine-derived precursors (Section 2, Section 3 and Section 4), and the second part of the article focuses on ornithine derivatives that are precursors of siderophores in bacteria and fungi (Section 5, Section 6 and Section 7). We provide evidence indicating the existence of converging pathways for the biosynthesis of \u03b1-AAA and \u03b1-aminoadipate semialdehyde in filamentous fungi and Gram-positive bacteria (particularly actinobacteria, such as Streptomyces or Nocardia species) [17]."]
