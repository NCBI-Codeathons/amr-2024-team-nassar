["Introduction", "Natural products play important roles in the agricultural and pharmaceutical sectors. For instance, most small molecule drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration are either natural product (NP), NP derivatives, or synthetic compounds with NP pharmacophores (Newman & Cragg, 2020). To counteract drug resistance, it is necessary to discover new compounds. Additionally, it has been estimated that 85% of the human, disease-associated proteome lack an associated therapeutic (Neklesa et al., 2017), implying a large therapeutic gap that could be at least partially filled by NP discovery.", "Advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics have revealed the untapped NP biosynthesis potential of microorganisms (Bachmann et al., 2014; Gavriilidou et al., 2022). A recent study predicted that only 3% of NPs encoded in bacterial genomes have been discovered (Gavriilidou et al., 2022). The discovery of new NPs is hampered by two main factors. First, most microorganisms from which NPs can be discovered remain uncultured. Second, the conditions used in the laboratory to study culturable microorganisms may not be appropriate for production in amounts that enable discovery and development (Baltz, 2017).", "In bacteria, the genes that encode the biosynthesis of a NP are often colocalized in the genome, forming biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Most BGCs have not been connected to a NP and are thus termed orphan. The exploration of orphan BGCs in the native producers or through heterologous expression offers an avenue for discovery. Strategies that have been used to activate gene expression and access the biosynthetic potential of microorganisms in the native producers include variation of the culture conditions, addition of elicitors to the culture media, co-cultivation to replicate the environmental conditions that promote NP production, and genetic approaches as reviewed here (Covington et al., 2021). Genetic approaches can be targeted to a specific NP of interest. Examples include deletion of pathway-specific negative regulators, overexpression of positive regulators, or promoter exchange (Covington et al., 2021). A drawback of genetic engineering of native producers is that tools for genetic manipulation must be developed for each strain of interest. Moreover, native producer centric methods cannot be used for uncultured bacteria.", "Alternatively, heterologous expression of orphan BGCs in an established host strain offers great potential for NP discovery (Fig.\u00a01). BGCs that are not well expressed under laboratory conditions can be refactored for activation and NPs from uncultured bacteria or metagenomes can be explored as well. However, some major challenges are BGC prioritization, cloning of the complete BGC, appropriate expression of the BGC in the selected host, and the identification and isolation of products in practical yields.", "Fig. 1.Pipeline for natural product discovery by heterologous expression. Genomic DNA is sequenced and analyzed with bioinformatic tools. Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are predicted and prioritized. The selected BGCs are cloned and transferred into a suitable host for expression. Metabolomics tools are used for natural product detection, and if enough quantities are produced, the natural product is isolated and characterized. BioRender was used to generate this figure.", "Pipeline for natural product discovery by heterologous expression. Genomic DNA is sequenced and analyzed with bioinformatic tools.

We also searched with the terms \u2018biosynthetic gene cluster\u2019 AND \u2018heterologous expression\u2019 AND \u2018bacteria\u2019 AND \u2018discovery\u2019. Additionally, we used the search terms \u2018genome mining\u2019 AND \u2018heterologous expression\u2019 AND \u2018bacteria\u2019. Because our aim was to focus the review on heterologous expression for NP discovery, studies were excluded if they only reported rediscovery of known NPs, close congeners of known NPs, or NPs previously detected in native producers. Despite careful analysis, we expect we may have missed relevant articles that were not identified using the search terms above and apologize to researchers whose work we inadvertently omitted. Based on the 50 identified articles (Supplemental Table S1), below we discuss the rationale for BGC prioritization, cloning methods, biosynthetic class, source taxa, and host choice (Figs\u00a02\u20134). We then summarize and discuss large scale studies that have allowed the determination of success rates (Table\u00a01). We conclude with a discussion of remaining challenges. Our goal is to obtain insights on approaches used with the hope of informing researchers whose goal is to find natural products from orphan BGCs.", "Fig. 2.Discovery of bacterial natural products by heterologous expression in the last 5 years.
