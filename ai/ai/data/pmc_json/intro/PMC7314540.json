["INTRODUCTION", "Eons of evolution have forced living organisms to create killing agents to sufficiently eliminate the competing species. It required the extremely effective mechanisms of self-resistance to develop simultaneously, as well. These naturally evolved mechanisms are ubiquitous in all kingdoms ranging from microbes to advanced multicellular organisms. Competing with natural processes, researchers have devised artificial catalytic bioscavengers tailored by directed enzyme evolution to protect against the particularly toxic synthetic nerve agents (1\u20133). One of the most important lessons learned from the rational design and combinatorial approaches is the necessity of either of the two factors. It is either an extremely efficient binding to the substrate or a diffusion-limited catalytic efficiency of a bioscavenger to eliminate even the trace concentrations of a free toxin (4). The biodiversity of microbial communities is maintained by an intricate network of interactions between bacterial killers and the counteracting resistant bacteria competing with each other to colonize various ecological niches (5). Bacteria use the evolved antibiotic molecules to kill their competitors (6, 7). In turn, selection pressure drives the evolution of enzymes that inactivate antibiotics; thus, they may be considered as natural catalytic bioscavengers detoxifying the potent killing agents (8). In contrast to the artificially designed bioscavengers, a broader substrate specificity is usually a more beneficial vector of selection in natural microbial communities, which is well documented in aminoglycoside (9) and macrolide (10) antibiotic resistance enzymes."]
