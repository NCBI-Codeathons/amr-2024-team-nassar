["Introduction", "It is widely accepted that new antibacterial drugs will be required to address the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria.1 \u2018New\u2019 in this context is often understood to mean unprecedented in terms of chemical structure and/or antibacterial mode of action and it is certainly the case that useful antibacterial drug candidates will likely possess one or both of these attributes. Nevertheless, these attributes are proxies for the type of novelty that is ultimately required: the ability to exert an antibacterial effect on pathogens resistant to drug classes already in clinical use. After all, an antibacterial drug candidate that possesses chemical and/or mechanistic novelty will have limited utility if its activity is substantially comprised as a result of cross-resistance with earlier classes.", "Despite this, little direct effort is expended on investigating/avoiding cross-resistance in the typical antibacterial discovery project. Instead, the potential for cross-resistance to newly discovered scaffolds is usually addressed indirectly\u2014and often at a relatively advanced stage of preclinical evaluation\u2014by assessing the activity of the compound against sizeable collections of target pathogen(s) isolated from the clinic.2 An exception to this approach is in discovery efforts that seek to identify novel analogues of an established antibacterial drug class, since such projects must proceed alive to the potential for cross-resistance from the very outset. In these cases, analogues are tested at an early stage of evaluation against strains harbouring resistance determinants known to compromise the antibacterial activity of clinically deployed class members (e.g. Seiple et al.3).", "We consider that this latter strategy could usefully be employed more broadly in antibacterial discovery to provide a rapid and direct indication of potential cross-resistance issues at an early stage in the process, thereby reducing wasted effort in progressing compounds that are only later revealed to possess such resistance liabilities. Here, we describe the initial iteration of a platform for cross-resistance testing, comprising a panel of Staphylococcus aureus strains of defined antimicrobial resistance genotype established in a uniform genetic background. Use of this cross-resistance platform (CRP) to test two potential antibacterial drug candidates revealed that the activity of one of these (batumin) is dramatically attenuated by a resistance phenotype that pre-exists in the clinic, implying that it is not a promising candidate for antibacterial chemotherapy, and underscoring the utility of the proposed approach to cross-resistance testing."]
