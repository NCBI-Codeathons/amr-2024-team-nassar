["Introduction", "The circadian clock is an essential evolutionary mechanism permitting biological functions to be temporally controlled and pre-emptively coordinated in anticipation of food intake and physical activity. Located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, the central circadian clock or \u2018master pacemaker\u2019 is entrained by light and synchronises peripheral molecular clocks at the tissue level (1). The central and peripheral clocks ensure 24-hour rhythms of biological functions, including sleep-wake cycles, hormone secretion, cardiovascular function and whole-body metabolism (2). Although core clock machinery is ubiquitous across all tissues and cell types, clock transcriptional output is highly tissue-specific and is impacted by physiological cues such as eating, stress and physical activity (3); as such, the circadian clock induces 24-hour oscillations in substrate metabolism, glucose homeostasis (4), skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity (5) and oxidative capacity (6).", "Circadian entrainment that aligns internal molecular clock rhythms with external time cues, such as waking and feeding times, is critical to maintaining circadian biological homeostasis. Thus, misalignment between the internal molecular clock and timed environmental cues is associated with several adverse health outcomes, as evidenced by large-scale epidemiological studies. For example, robust relationships between shift work, specifically night shifts, and metabolic disease risk with data from the Nurse Health Study revealing an increased risk of ischaemic stroke (7) and diabetes (8) in night-shift working participants compared to day working colleagues. In addition, Scandinavian population studies support the relationship between sleep disturbance and metabolic health, with Swedish and Danish night shift workers exhibiting greater obesity risk, lipid profile abnormalities, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes compared to day-working colleagues (9, 10). Whilst correlation does not necessarily equal causality, it must be noted that simulated shift work experiments have revealed transcriptomic (11), endocrine (12, 13) and metabolic (14) circadian misalignment following relatively short intervention periods.", "Shift working aside; the modern human lifestyle poses a severe threat to the entrainment and coordination of central and peripheral clocks with artificial 24-hour lighting, prolonged periods of inactivity and access to energy-dense foods, all disrupting the circadian rhythm (15\u201317). Notably, a recent cross-sectional investigation utilising primary skeletal muscle cells from type-2 diabetic and healthy control participants revealed divergent skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism (18) and altered clock-controlled gene expression, leading to impaired mitochondrial respiration in T2D skeletal muscle. Accordingly, exercise represents a significant, non-pharmacological intervention capable of preventing or delaying the onset of metabolic disease and reversing the adverse effects of the modern human lifestyle, including physical inactivity and poor diet (19, 20).", "The timing of exercise has profound effects on physical capacity, homeostatic disturbance, and metabolic responses, potentially providing two-fold benefits. Firstly, exercise timing may act as a crucial time-giver (zeitgeber) for individuals and has been proposed as a strategy to synchronise and realign disrupted central and peripheral circadian clocks (21). Secondly, the circadian regulation of exercise, including the diurnal variation in exercise performance (22, 23) and alterations to substrate metabolism (17, 24, 25), may potentiate the beneficial effects of exercise and subsequent health outcomes.", "On this basis, the present narrative review aims to provide an overview of the bimodal impact of exercise timing, i.e., the role of exercise as a zeitgeber to improve circadian clock alignment and the temporal impact of exercise timing on the metabolic and functional outcomes associated with exercise. We will highlight research opportunities that may identify exercise \u201cprime times\u201d for the biological outcomes and health benefits in response to exercise."]
