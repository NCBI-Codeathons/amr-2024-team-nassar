["1. Introduction", "The widespread use of antimicrobial compounds in medicine and agriculture has led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, recognized now as a significant threat to human health [1,2]. The search for novel compounds possessing antimicrobial properties is still one of the ways we could overcome this global challenge, and microorganisms are the main source in this research [3,4,5]. Recently great attention was attracted by microbes that form symbioses with higher organisms, in particular, plants and animals [6]. The main reason for that is the mutual evolutionary path, wherein microbes have proved their usefulness to the host [7,8].", "Some prokaryotes, principally the phylum Actinomycetota [9], are involved in the formation of so-called \u201cdefensive (or protective) symbioses\u201d [10,11,12] with many eukaryotic organisms. The Insecta class, with the largest number of species, is remarkable among them for these interactions [13,14]. Through the release of various antibiotic compounds, actinobacteria protect insects, their brood and food substrate from potential pathogens and parasites [7,15,16,17,18]. Well known in this respect are leaf-cutting ants (Atta, Acromyrmex) of the subfamily Myrmicinae. Their existence, and in particular their feeding and development, depends entirely on the symbiotic actinobacteria of the genus Pseudonocardia [19], localized on the insect cuticle.", "However, the specificity of \u201cdefensive symbioses\u201d in other species of Formicidae remains unclear, including one of the dominant ants of the steppe zone, Messor structor (the steppe harvester ant). In this paper, we report on the isolation of actinobacteria from a laboratory colony of Messor structor, the identification of the produced antimicrobial compound (albomycin \u03b42), and its high activity against individual entomopathogens."]
