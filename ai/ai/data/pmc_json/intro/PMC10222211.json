["1. Introduction", "Natural bioresources are well known for producing secondary metabolites with unique features, highly complex structures, and biochemical properties valuable for human healthcare and well-being, which have inspired industries for numerous biotechnological applications [1,2]. The urge to fill the industrial pipelines and to identify novel lead-like compounds for drug discovery that can meet the challenge of lacking suitable therapeutic agents for a wide range of diseases is very high [3]. This comprehensive review covers the high-throughput (HT) workflow for natural product (NP) discovery, from bioassay screening, docking, and mode of action (MoA) prediction to HT analytical equipment, metabolomics, genomics, NP databases, in silico computational approaches that support NP dereplication (early identification of known compounds), metabolite profiling, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR), and computer assisted structure elucidation (CASE), as well as methods for the determination of secondary metabolites relative and absolute configuration to elucidate their 3D chemical structure, with particular focus on methodological prospects and advances (Figure 1).", "Two major bottlenecks that hinder NP discovery are dereplication and structure elucidation, particularly the determination of the relative and absolute configuration of secondary metabolites with stereogenic centers. Herein, particular focus will be given to these subjects. Dereplication has become a hot topic in the past decade, with nearly 1240 publications (Web of Science) and 908 articles published after April 2014 that have received over 40,520 citations in total. In the pursuit of Marine Natural Products (MNP), Blue Biotechnology (BB), which is the application of science and technology to living aquatic organisms to produce knowledge, goods, and services (OECD, 2016), brings together multiactors and multidisciplinary fields, blending them in new ways such as combining organic and analytical chemistry with molecular biology, genomics, and/or informatic chemometrics, thus providing key conceptual or methodological advances that are likely to open innovative research possibilities. Some of the NP methods are so intricately connected that it is very difficult to separate them into sections without overlapping. Our insights into this theme will give priority to studies that reported significant advances in the field, highlighting the major advances that have shaped the ground, including method comparisons, our perspective on developments, future trends, and the carving of new directions. This review is meant to be complementary to our highly cited 2015 Natural Products Report (NPR) paper, entitled \u201cDereplication: racing to speed up the natural products discovery process\u201d [4].", "Since April 2014 to January 2023, eighty-nine reviews have been published out of the 908 published papers on NP dereplication, while 387 papers were reported in the ambit of NP structure elucidation, with 40 of these considering the determination of molecular relative and absolute configuration. These include highly cited and recent reviews covering: (1) integration of taxonomic and/or bioactivity data [5]; (2) the analysis of the chromatographic hyphenated techniques (LC-MS, GC-MS, and LC-NMR) with spectrometric (MS/MS) and spectroscopic data (NMR) for metabolite profiling [6]; (3) a comprehensive overview of NP databases, with emphasis on free open access databases [7,8,9,10,11,12,13]; (4) molecular networking strategies for NP dereplication and distinct dereplication workflows [14,15,16,17,18]; (5) dereplication using metabolomics, genomics, and metagenomics [19,20,21,22,23,24]; and (6) in silico methods (artificial intelligence and machine learning) for dereplication and structure elucidation [25,26]. With regard to computational/bioinformatics tools, the reviews of Medema et al. [27] and Ren et al. [28], both published in 2020, are suggested, while the paper by Prihoda et al. [29] is recommended for machine learning (ML) methods in NP discovery.", "Unambiguous stereochemical assignments of NP remain a challenge. In this context, we highlight reviews on: (1) reassignment of absolute configuration [30,31]; (2) NMR calculation with quantum chemical approaches, such as DP4 [32,33,34,35,36,37], including optical rotation, and electronic and vibrational circular dichroism aided by quantum chemical calculations [35,38]. There are several reviews that address the developments in computer-assisted structure elucidation (CASE) systems [4,39,40,41,42]. Among them, we highlight that 3D structure analysis in conjunction with CASE can be performed not only by including 2D NOESY/ROESY experimental data [39,40,41], but also by using DFT chemical shift analysis [35,40,43,44,45]; and (3) structure elucidation aided by genomics [46,47,48,49,50,51]. Many reviews that systematically list the most used tools of synthetic biology methodologies have been published from mid-2014 to date. For reviews on microbial genome mining, these particularly focus on genome mining strategies and tools for ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) [48,52,53]. The work of Robinson et al. [54] is suggested as an excellent review with a roadmap on metagenomic enzyme identification.", "The authors of this review are members of the COST Action CA18238\u2014European Transdisciplinary Networking Platform for Marine Biotechnology (https://www.ocean4biotech.eu/ (accessed on 23 March 2023)) [55,56]. Thus, although the techniques described in this review can be used both for NP of terrestrial and marine origin, we chose, whenever possible, to give examples of MNP.", "Discovering unique MNP presents added challenges such as accessing organisms in extreme or deep environments, reviving uncultivable microorganisms under lab conditions, dereplication, solving sustainable supply issues, discovering their bioactivity and mode of action (MoA), and optimizing their pharmacological properties [51,57]. However, efforts made in these directions have been rewarded, as MNP are a promising source of medicines, with 17 marine-derived drugs successfully approved and several other marketable marine-derived products. The development of innovative discovery approaches in the fields of screening methods, metabolomics, genomics, metagenomics, proteomics, combinatorial biosynthesis, synthetic biology, expression systems, and bioinformatics, combined with dereplication, will continue to unravel MNP with unique structural and biological properties and MoA for numerous biotechnological purposes [58,59].", "It is our goal to give insight to the BB community on the most advanced HT methods for MNP discovery and knowledge on structure elucidation. We believe that this review may be used as a guideline for the whole NP discovery process in academic laboratories."]
