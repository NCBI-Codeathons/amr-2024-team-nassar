["Introduction", "Plants, the most profoundly distributed lineage on earth, possess the remarkable abilities to convert solar energy into bio-matter and produce oxygen while consume the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. At the same time, plants have to face the frequent offense of inhospitable abiotic stresses caused by the constant fluctuations of global climate since plants cannot \u201crun away\u201d from them. The challenging conditions like drought, radiation, nutrient deficiencies, temperature extremes (cold and heat), metal ion toxicity, salinity and organic pollution are typical abiotic stress factors that plants frequently encounter (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022). These abiotic factors have drastically influenced plant distribution and growth status globally (Nolan et\u00a0al., 2018). It is long known that beneficial microbes are helping plants to overcome climate change and other adverse conditions through a variety of ways (Sch\u00fctzend\u00fcbel and Polle, 2002; Haney et\u00a0al., 2015; Murali et\u00a0al., 2021). For example, microbes can increase the activity of plant antioxidant defense enzyme (Mastouri et\u00a0al., 2012), release beneficial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that trigger resistance response (Liu and Zhang, 2015), and modulate the expression of plant metal transporters against the accumulation of heavy metals (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2020). However, many aspects of the plant-microbe interactions for mutual benefits are still in the \u201cblack box\u201d and lack in-depth mechanism analysis.", "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), referring to the exchange of genetic material between distant lineages, is considered as an effective mechanism to spread evolutionary success in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Huang, 2013; Daubin and Sz\u00f6ll\u0151si, 2016). Studies on HGT genes introduced into eukaryotic taxa have been expanding fast in the last twenty years as next-generation sequencing technology has made large-scale genome data available (Soucy et\u00a0al., 2015). Recent researches have demonstrated that genes in plant genomes important for the function of specific plant activities, including the biosynthesis of plant structure components and hormones, plant defense, nitrogen recycling and stress resistance, can be obtained via the omnipresent HGT process (Yue et\u00a0al., 2012). It is strongly proposed in a recent review that HGTs possess the potency to drastically influence plant evolutionary path by imparting selective advantages (Wickell and Li, 2020). Here are some examples illustrating the importance of microbe-derived HGTs in plants that confer adaptive benefits. Firstly, it is found that the ancestor of land plants acquired a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), the entry point of the phenylpropanoid pathway, through HGT during symbioses with soil bacteria and fungi (Emiliani et\u00a0al., 2009); The second case is that Physcomitrella patens is suggested to acquire from bacteria acyl-activating enzyme 18 (AAE18)/flavin monooxygenase (YUC3) for auxin biosynthesis, guanine deaminase, allantoate amidohydrolase and ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase associated with purine degradation, as well as subtilases for protein degradation (Yue et\u00a0al., 2012). Besides, Li et\u00a0al. (2018) detected that the squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC) encoding genes in three plant clades (mosses, liverworts and lycophytes/ferns) are interspersing with bacterial SHCs, suggesting the occurrence of independent and repeated HGT events for enhanced adaption since the product of SHC, hopanoid, constitutes plant cell membrane important for maintaining cell integrity. Lastly, it is reported that the adaptive genes in Zygnematophyceae, GRAS and PYR/PYL/RCAR that enhance resistance to abiotic stresses (e.g., desiccation), were obtained through HGT from nearby soil bacteria (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2019). However, many of these previous investigations focused mainly on individual plant lineage or limited HGT events on important economic aspects such as the valuable plant metabolism pathways. Despite these efforts, we still have little knowledge on the amount or impact of HGT-derived genes in plants that have potentials to confer resistance against a wide range of abiotic stresses (e.g., low pH, osmotic pressure, heat and cold stress) and hence promote the growth of plants in extreme conditions. It is still an open question that if there is microbe-originated HGT(s) that has facilitated plant to adapt such abiotic stresses. And if there are such HGT genes, what are their functions in combating abiotic stresses and to what extent are they distributed in the plant genomes?", "Against such background, in this study, we have chosen fourteen high-quality plant genomes covering major plant taxa (Clade Viridiplantae) within Phyla Chlorophyta and Streptophyta, and tried to uncover and scrutinize putative microbe-originated HGT genes that are associated with abiotic stress resistance in these genomes employing a combination of methods previously showed to be highly effective in identifying HGT between distantly related species (Sch\u00f6nknecht et\u00a0al., 2014), including BLASTP-based searches and gene tree reconciliation. To further testify the expression potential of the detected HGT genes, we supply codon adaption index calculation, deep-learning-driven protein structure prediction, fold alignment, and molecular dynamics to assess the expression potential and functionality of the abiotic stress resistance genes acquired by plants from microbial lineages. Our findings indicated that the HGT events in beneficial microbes putatively colonizing plant might be an important source of acquisitions of genes that help enhance plant tolerance against abiotic stresses. This study has also advanced our understanding on plant-microbe interactions and the adaptive evolution of plants to encounter adverse conditions."]
