["Introduction", "Invasive candidiasis associated with biofilm formation is a fungal infection of difficult therapeutic management, further complicated by the rise of species with strong resistance against antifungal drugs (Sato et al., 2009; Cavalheiro and Teixeira, 2018; Pappas et al., 2018). Fungal colonization contributes to lower lung function and might lead to severe lung disease (Sato et al., 2009). Since different fungal species differ in drug resistance characteristics (Ademe and Girma, 2020; Dahiya et al., 2020), prompt diagnosis of Candida species and accurate susceptibility monitoring of antifungal resistance are key diagnostic essentials.", "Among Candida species, the multi-drug resistant pathogenic Candida auris (C. auris) (Sato et al., 2009) can cause nosocomial infections in immunocompromised persons. The presence of this pathogen is often associated with consistent candidemia and high mortality rate, thus representing a serious threat to global health (Marak and Dhanashree, 2018; Ademe and Girma, 2020; Dahiya et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020) 1. C. auris genotypes, which specialize to particular geological areas, frequently exhibit multidrug-resistance with specific clades displaying unusual sensitivity profile. C. auris is comprehensive of five distinct clades, classified according to where the first isolate of the clade was reported: South Asian (Clade I), East Asian (Clade II), African (Clade III), South American (Clade IV), and Iranian (Clade V) (Chow et al., 2019; Welsh et al., 2019). These clades possess specific genetic and biochemical characteristics, which link to their response to different drugs (Forsberg et al., 2019; Guadalupe Frias-De and Martinez-Herrera, 2020). It should be noted that misidentifications and inconsistent results from commercialized kits often complicate candidiasis management, lead to treatment failure, and potentially amplify multidrug-resistance risks (Snayd et al., 2018). Given the progressively recorded spread of C. auris into an increasing number of countries, measures of preventive control, and deeper knowledge of physiological responses to specific drugs are paramount to counteract lethal effects and to interrupt transmission.", "In a previous paper (Pezzotti et al., 2021), we demonstrated the power of Raman spectroscopy and imaging in studying Candida species. Empowered with a specifically tailored machine-learning algorithm, Raman spectroscopy could enable swift identification of C. auris clades with respect to Candida albicans ones. High-resolution Raman hyperspectral imaging was also applied as a molecular microscopy tool for in situ label-free screening of living Candida yeast cells. Besides concurrently accomplishing accuracy and testing speed, the Raman imaging approach showed potential for revealing fundamental details related to structure, virulence, and drug resistance characteristics of different Candida species.", "In this paper, we build upon our previous Raman analyses of living Candida cells and monitor in situ the susceptibility of C. auris Clades II and III to two primary antifungal compounds: Amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. These two clades were purposely selected. Clade II, which was first discovered in Japan (Sato et al., 2009), has a propensity for infecting the ear, while Clade III causes invasive infections and large scale outbreaks (Welsh et al., 2019). Regarding drug resistance, Clade III has been observed to be resistant to multiple antifungal drugs including polyenes, while Clade II has not yet been reported to possess drug resistance (Forsberg et al., 2019). Raman imaging of C. auris clades before and after drug treatment gives us a chance of delving into the metabolic responses of different Candida species and molecular-scale candidacidal mechanisms behind different antifungal compounds, thus refining the state-of-art understanding of their distinct actions, and detailing the structural modifications of this dangerous pathogen in response to different drugs."]
