["INTRODUCTION", "Recent meta-analyses of semen parameters from 1973 to 2019 indicate a significant global decline in sperm concentration (SC) and total sperm count (TSC), with the rate of reduction accelerating (1). Inferior sperm quality has been strongly associated with adverse reproductive outcomes (2). Nonetheless, the predictive capacity of routine semen analysis for assessing male fecundity is constrained (3). The DNA fragmentation index (DFI), a measure of sperm DNA fragmentation, has gained clinical relevance (4). Factors, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) (5) and inflammatory agents (6), have been identified as contributors to sperm DNA damage. High levels of sperm DNA fragmentation are associated with reduced fertilization rates, poor embryo quality, lower pregnancy success, and increased miscarriage rates (7).", "Current treatments for high DNA fragmentation index (HDFI) include antioxidant therapy, infection management, and lifestyle changes (8), but these approaches often prove inadequate, especially in cases of idiopathic HDFI (9). This has led to an increased reliance on assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) (5), yet the success rates vary, underscoring the need for alternative treatment strategies.", "The human microbiome, encompassing the collective genetic material of microbiota in various body niches, plays a vital role in physiological homeostasis (10). Imbalances in the microbiome can lead to various pathologies (11). Recent research has begun to explore the connection between the semen microbiome and semen quality (12). Notably, a study by Sergio et al. using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a negative correlation between certain bacteria and sperm DNA fragmentation in a Western Mediterranean cohort (13). Thus, our study aims to further investigate the role of the semen microbiome in HDFI using both 16S rRNA and metabolome sequencing. We hypothesize that the seminal microbiota could significantly influence sperm DNA integrity, potentially offering new avenues for HDFI treatment."]
