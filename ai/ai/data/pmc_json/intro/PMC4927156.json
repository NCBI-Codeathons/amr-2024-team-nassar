["Introduction", "The emerging threat of antibiotic resistance [1] necessitates new efforts and ideas to control bacterial pathogens. Mapping the determinants of antibiotic resistance in bacteria will be critical for evaluating new antibiotics. In addition to the direct target of the antibiotic, drug efflux, drug permeability, and stress response pathways all contribute to resistance [2]. Global genetic approaches such as chemical-genomic screens, which measure the sensitivities of a large library of mutants to a set of stresses, can be a first-step in discovering resistance determinants and characterizing the mode-of-action of antibiotics. Chemical-genomic screens in the model bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 [3\u201310] have already provided a critical resource for the bacterial research community and catalyzed insights into molecular systems critical for bacterial viability, stress survival, and resistance to antibiotics [11\u201315].", "Despite these successes, the chemical-genetic space of E. coli remains largely unexplored, as only slightly more than 50% of the genes in E. coli K-12 are \u201cresponsive\u201d, defined as having a statistically significant fitness effect for at least one stress [8]. Reasoning that the remaining unresponsive genes may encode resistance determinants to previously untested antibiotics and stresses, we conducted a new chemical-genomic screen of the previously screened library [8,10] focusing on antibiotics with unique or unknown modes of action. We integrated the data from this screen with the results of Nichols et al. [8] to create an expanded chemical-genomics dataset that revealed new determinants of antibiotic resistance.", "From this dataset, we further investigated resistance to the antibiotics kasugamycin (Ksg) [16] and blasticidin S (BcS) [17]. Both antibiotics were discovered in the mid-20th century as antifungals effective against Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast. Kasugamycin has a continuing use in the treatment of M. oryzae, bacterial pathogens of rice, and Erwinia amylovora, the bacterial pathogen that causes fire blight. We discovered that both antibiotics enter bacterial cells using illicit transport, the active uptake of non-physiological compounds, through two peptide ABC-importers. We suggest that loss-of-function mutations in homologous peptide ABC-importers are likely to play a role in the development of kasugamycin resistance for E. amylovora and many other pathogens."]
