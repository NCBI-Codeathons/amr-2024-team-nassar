["Introduction", "The genus Pantoea is a diverse group within the Erwiniaceae whose members inhabit a variety of aquatic and terrestrial environments (Walterson and Stavrinides, 2015). Members of Pantoea have also been found in association with various insects, animals, and humans (Walterson and Stavrinides, 2015). As a genus, Pantoea has a variety of unique characteristics and capabilities that make it of interest in both environmental and clinical settings including applications in biocontrol, bioremediation, biosensing, and therapeutics (Walterson and Stavrinides, 2015). Of significance, many Pantoea strains produce natural product antimicrobials effective against human, plant, and/or animal pathogens (Walterson and Stavrinides, 2015). These antimicrobials are primarily synthesized through secondary metabolic pathways via biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which include genes that encode enzymes, as well as genes involved in regulation, export, and resistance. To date, there are at least 22 known unique antimicrobials found in members of Pantoea, which collectively represent 12 different BGCs.", "Among the earliest described antimicrobials produced by Pantoea were the tetronate antibiotics, agglomerin A, B, C, and D, which were isolated from Pantoea agglomerans PB-6042 (Shoji et al., 1989). These compounds are synthesized by the same seven gene cluster and differ only in the structure of the hydrocarbon chain found on the acyl group of the compound (Terui et al., 1990; Kanchanabanca et al., 2013). The agglomerins show moderate activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria (Shoji et al., 1989). Andrimid, another Pantoea antibiotic, is a pseudopeptide synthesized through a hybrid NRPS-PKS pathway (Jin et al., 2006). Andrimid was first extracted from the broth culture of a symbiont of a brown planthopper in 1987 (Fredenhagen et al., 1987); however, the 21-gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of andrimid was not described until almost 20\u2009years later in P. agglomerans Eh335 (Jin et al., 2006). Andrimid acts by inhibiting the \u03b2-subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in fatty acid synthesis, thus inhibiting cell growth (Freiberg et al., 2004; Jin et al., 2006). Andrimid is effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (Needham et al., 1994).", "Pantoea also produces phenazine antibiotics, most notably, D-alanylgriseoluteic acid (AGA). AGA was first described in P. agglomerans Eh1087 as inhibiting the growth of the phytopathogen, Erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight in apples and pears (Kearns and Hale, 1996; Kearns and Mahanty, 1998; Giddens et al., 2002). The spectrum of activity of AGA has since been expanded to include many Gram-positive bacteria including clinical strains of S. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (Giddens and Bean, 2007). A 16-gene cluster is responsible for AGA biosynthesis and resistance, but also directs the synthesis of at least two phenazine intermediates: phenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic acid and griseoluteic acid (Giddens et al., 2002).", "The tripeptide antibiotics, dapdiamide A, B, C, D, and E were first identified from P. agglomerans CU0119 (Dawlaty et al., 2010). These structurally similar compounds share a central L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid fragment, but differ in their two amide-linked side chains (Dawlaty et al., 2010). Dapdiamides A-E are synthesized by a nine-gene cluster (Dawlaty et al., 2010). The dapdiamide cluster is homologous to two other Pantoea antibiotic BGCs: herbicolin I produced by Pantoea vagans C9-1, and 2-amino-3-(oxirane-2,3-dicarboxamido)-propanoyl-valine (APV) produced by P. agglomerans 48b/90 (V\u00f6lksch and Sammer, 2008; Smits et al., 2010, 2011; Kamber et al., 2012). Herbicolin I and APV are structurally identical to dapdiamide E, although the stereochemistry of these has not been confirmed (V\u00f6lksch and Sammer, 2008; Smits et al., 2011; Kamber et al., 2012).", "Pantoea strains have also been reported to produce the antifungals, herbicolin A and B. These two lipopeptides were first isolated from P. agglomerans A 111 (Winkelmann et al., 1981), and later from P. agglomerans ZJU23 (Xu et al., 2022), which led to the characterization of the BGC responsible for the production of both molecules and their mechanism of action. Herbicolin A is synthesized by a 10-gene cluster and is thought to inhibit sterol-containing fungi through the disruption of ergosterol-containing lipid rafts in fungal cell membranes (Xu et al., 2022). Herbicolin B is an intermediate of herbicolin A and is glycosylated by AcbI in the last steps of synthesis to form herbicolin A (Xu et al., 2022). Herbicolin B is also biologically active against sterol-containing fungi, but less so than herbicolin A (Greiner and Winkelmann, 1991; Xu et al., 2022).", "The peptide antibiotics pantocin A and B, produced by P. agglomerans Eh318, were first described as inhibitors of E. amylovora (Wright et al., 2001). Pantocin A acts by inhibiting histidine biosynthesis, and thus, its activity is neutralized if exogenous histidine is available (Wright et al., 2001; Jin et al., 2003a). The BGC for pantocin A has been described as a three-gene operon approximately 2.5\u2009kb in size (Jin et al., 2003b). A small open reading frame (ORF) directly upstream of the cluster, which encodes a 30-amino acid precursor peptide is also required for pantocin A biosynthesis (Jin et al., 2003b). The BGCs of two other previously described Pantoea antibiotics, the microcin MccEh252, produced by P. agglomerans Eh252, and herbicolin O, produced by P. vagans C9-1 share high sequence identity to the pantocin A BGC (Vanneste et al., 2008). Genetic and chemical analysis of herbicolin O has recently confirmed it to be the same antibiotic as pantocin A (Ishimaru et al., 2017). Some discrepancies between the physiochemical characteristics of MccEh252 and pantocin A have been reported; however, these may be due to differences in assaying methodologies (Vanneste et al., 2008). The range of activity of MccEh252 is also indistinguishable from that of pantocin A (Vanneste et al., 2008); thus, it is likely that these two antibiotics are identical. In contrast to pantocin A, pantocin B is arginine reversible and works to inhibit its target by disrupting arginine biosynthesis through inhibition of N-acetylornithine transaminase (Brady et al., 1999). Although the structure and mechanism of action are known for pantocin B (Brady et al., 1999), the BGC has yet to be published.", "BGCs responsible for the production of Pantoea Natural Products (PNP) 1 through 5 have also been described, but little is known about their structures or modes of action (Walterson et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2020; Williams and Stavrinides, 2020; Kirk and Stavrinides, 2023). PNP-1 from Pantoea ananatis BRT175 is encoded by an eight-gene cluster and is effective against E. amylovora and select Pantoea strains (Walterson et al., 2014). After the discovery of the PNP-1 gene cluster, the structure of PNP-1 was determined to be 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine, a non-proteogenic amino acid belonging to the class of antibiotics known as the oxyvinylglycines (Okrent et al., 2018). The cluster for PNP-2, identified in the cystic fibrosis isolate P. agglomerans TX10 is composed of six genes (Robinson et al., 2020). The resulting antibiotic is broad-spectrum, with the ability to inhibit both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including Enterobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Kosakonia, Pseudocitrobacter, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus (Robinson et al., 2020). PNP-3 is also broad-spectrum, with the ability to inhibit drug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in addition to Klebsiella\nspp., E. coli, Enterobacter\nspp., S. aureus, and Streptococcus mutans (Williams and Stavrinides, 2020). PNP-3 is encoded by an eight-gene cluster, and was found to be produced by P. agglomerans strains 3581 and SN01080 (Williams and Stavrinides, 2020).", "The BGC for PNP-4 found in P. agglomerans B025670 consists of 14 genes and was identified using comparative genomic approaches (Williams et al., 2020). PNP-4 is effective against Enterobacter\nspp., E. amylovora, E. coli, Kosakonia\nspp., Pseudocitrobacter\nspp., and Salmonella Typhimurium, including some MDR strains (Williams et al., 2020). Lastly, the cluster for PNP-5, found in the clinical isolate P. agglomerans 20KB447973, is composed of 10 genes and shares similarity to previously described gene clusters for the dithiolopyrrolone antibiotic, holomycin, found in Streptomyces clavuligerus, Yersinia ruckeri, and Photobacterium galatheae (Li and Walsh, 2010; Qin et al., 2013; Sheng-Da et al., 2021). PNP-5 has not yet been confirmed to be structurally identical to holomycin. PNP-5 shows activity against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including Citrobacter\nspp., E. hormaechei, Enterobacter\nspp., E. amylovora, E. coli, Klebsiella\nspp., L. lactis, Salmonella Typhimurium, and S. mutans (Kirk and Stavrinides, 2023).", "In this study, we determined the distribution of these 12 Pantoea antibiotic BGCs. We then created phylogenies to establish the evolutionary relationships between homologous clusters from different species and combined this with an analysis of the flanking regions to help assess the potential evolutionary history of each cluster. We show that some antibiotic gene clusters may represent more recent acquisitions, while other clusters that appear widely distributed among Pantoea strains may be older. We also delineate and describe the sequence of the pantocin B gene cluster from the strain P. agglomerans Eh318."]
