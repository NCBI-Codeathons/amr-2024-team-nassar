["1. Introduction", "Infectious or communicative diseases have been a severe burden for mankind for millennia. The absence of knowledge of the pathogen organisms prevented prophylaxis and treatment of the maladies until the early 21st century. In Denmark, an overview of morbidity reveals that in the period 1876\u20131880 communicative diseases were the cause of almost 3/4 (72%) of mortality, in the period 1900\u20131903 almost half the deaths (42%), in 1920 about a 1/7 (15%), in 1945 only 4% and in 2013 only 0.5% [1,2]. The abrupt fall in death rate of communicative infections was caused by sanitation, higher living standards and introduction of efficient drugs as will be explained below. Bacteria were described as animalcules already in 1683 by the Dutch merchant Leeuwenhoeck [3,4]; but the importance of the discovery was not realized until 200 years later. Several different microorganisms were described and depictured by a Danish scientist M\u00fcller in the atlas Animalcula infusoria fluviatilia et marina (1786) [5]. The first correlation between microorganisms and health came in 1836 when the Italian civil servant Bassi described that a minute fungus (Botrytis bassina) was fatal to silkworms. The German clinician Sh\u00f6nlein realized in 1839 that the pathogen causing the human skin disease favus was a fungus (Achorion sch\u00f6leinii). Some scientists proposed in the 1830s that fermentation was a conversion of organic compound performed by living microorganisms (yeast). However, leading chemists such as Berzelius and Liebig suggested that fermentation was a purely chemical process [3]. In 1873, Pasteur published a study on the diseases of the vine revealing that in the microscope he could see two organisms on the surface of the peel of grapes, some small organisms and some big organisms. By heating the grapes to 80 \u2103 the small organisms were killed but the big survived. This later has been called Pasteurization [6]. Today the small organisms are known as bacteria and the big organisms as yeast. Another important contribution of Pasteur was the demonstration that life does not evolve spontaneously. Development of life in uninfected media was demonstrated to originate from germs present in the air. In 1849, Davaine demonstrated the presence of Bacillus anthracis in the blood of cattle suffering from anthrax. This was the first mammalian disease for which a bacterium was shown to be the pathogenic organism. Pasteur showed in 1877 that transfer of blood from an infected animal to a healthy animal communicates the disease. Pasteur also realized that virulence of the anthrax bacteria could be attenuated by cultivation at high temperature. Inoculation in animals with the attenuated organism protected the animal from developing disease. The technique of decreased virulence was used for prevention of rabies in a boy bitten by a mad dog. In 1882 Koch discovered the tubercle bacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). The studies of Pasteur and Koch formed the foundation of bacteriology as we know it today [3]. After these pioneering studies several pathogenic bacteria were characterized, Corynebacterium diphteriae (diphtheria) Pasteurella pestris (plague), Clostridium tetani (tetanus), Salmonella typhosa (typhoid fever), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis). In 1900, pathogenic organisms causing 21 diseases were discovered [3]. A late discovery of new pathogenic agents was made in 1983 when bacteria were discovered in the stomach of patients suffering from gastritis and peptic ulceration [7,8]. The bacteria later were identified as Campylobacter pyloridis [9]. The discovery was met with some skepticism, since it was difficult to accept that bacteria could live in the hostile environment of the stomach [10]. In 2008, Warren and Marshall were awarded the Nobel Price for their discovery of the pathogenic properties of what today is known as Helicobacter pylori [10]. In 2001, several 1425 infectious organisms were known, including 217 virus and prions, 538 bacteria, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa, and 287 helminths [11].", "The importance of hygiene for life expectancy was gradually understood in the last part of the 19th century. The ideal man in Greek/Roman philosophy was healthy and beautiful. To obtain a beautiful body, public baths were needed. Aquaducts provided fresh and clean water and public latrines were used. Sewers (cloacae) build in the 6th century B.C. are still a part of the Roman sewerage. According to Christianity, the body is just the holster for the soul and consequently needed no attention [12]. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century A.D., hygiene in Europe declined. In contrast, it was to some extent maintained in Medieval Muslim Europe [13]. Urbanization as a consequence of industrialization afforded metropoles with poor hygiene. Two major cholera outbreaks (1848\u20131849 and 1865\u20131867) encouraged sanitation. Construction of sewerages in most major European cities were completed in the last decade of the 19th century [13]. It soon was realized that dumping of the superfluous water and filth in rivers or seas caused unacceptable contamination. Consequently biological filters were installed in the early 21st century [13]. Sanitation was a time consuming project, even in the 1970s apartments with shared latrines in the backyard with no drainage could still be found in Copenhagen and probably also in other European cities. It is encouraging to realize that the construction of sewerage was initiated after the big cholera epidemics, but before it was established that the cholera bacteria (Vibrio cholerae) was the pathogenic organism 1883 [3]. Supply of clean piped water in general developed slower since this very often was constructed by private enterprises [13,14]. In northern Europe most cities had piped water in 1915 and most cities in southern Europe in 1940. Later the importance of higher standards of living and proper food has been realized [3].", "The effect of sanitation is clearly revealed by the abrupt fall in mortality caused by infectious diseases in the period 1875 to 1920. However, one infectious disease remained unaffected: syphilis [1]. Efficient therapy for bacterial diseases slowly started to appear in the second decade of the 20th century but the breakthrough came when sustainable production of penicillin was invented in the 1940s. The naturally occurring \u03b2-lactams afforded access to efficient antibiotic drugs [15,16,17]. The term chemotherapy was introduced by Ehrlich. It was defined as the use of drugs to injure an invading organism without injure to the host [18]. Later antibiotics were defined as compounds combating invading organisms [19]. Today the term chemotherapeutics is mainly used for drugs curing cancer diseases, in contrast to the original definition of Ehrlich. Antibiotics are drugs curing infectious diseases, irrespectively of natural or synthetic origin. The years from about 1940 to 1960 were the golden age of antibiotics. In this period most of the antibiotic classes used today were introduced. Emerging resistance toward antibiotics, however, becomes an increasing threat. In 2012, the Congress of the USA passed legislation for antibiotic development. In 2014, president Obama issued an order for substantial government intervention to stimulate infectious disease research and drug development [20]. Not all bacteria are hostile. An intact intestinal microbiota affords and important protection against pathogenic bacteria. Antibiotics should be used with care to prevent corruption of the intestinal flora [21]. The difference between antibiotics and vaccination (Section 9) is that the former only cure a disease, whereas the latter primarily prevents infection."]
