["INTRODUCTION", "Fungi have captivated the scientific community for centuries due to their diverse ecological roles and remarkable ability to produce an array of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs). SMs are small biologically active compounds that aid in adapting to different environments but are not required for normal function or survival (1). Many clades across the fungal kingdom produce SMs, including many that belong to the Pezizomycotina subphylum of filamentous fungi. These SMs have diverse bioactivities, including antifungals (2), UV protectants (3), antibacterials (4\u20136), iron sequesterers (7), antifeedants (8), immunosuppressants (9), and toxins (10). In addition to their ecological importance, fungal SMs are also of considerable interest to medicine, industry, and the bioeconomy and are used in a wide range of applications. It has been suggested that fungal SM chemical properties are more \u201cdrug-like\u201d compared to their bacterial counterparts by US Food and Drug Administration guidelines and oral bioavailability prognostic rules (11, 12). Many SMs such as penicillin (13), an antibiotic, and lovastatin (14), a cholesterol-lowering antifungal, are iconic drugs. Other SMs have been utilized in the food science, agricultural, and cosmetic industries for bioactivities such as antibiotics, pigments, and antifeedants.", "The genes involved in fungal SM production are typically located right next to each other in the genome and are known as BGCs (1, 15). It is estimated that filamentous fungal species may have up to 30\u201370 BGCs per genome (16), sometimes even more; these BGCs contain many different types of genes, such as core or backbone genes, whose protein products synthesize the backbone of the SM, backbone modifying genes, transport genes, transcriptional regulatory genes, and self-resistance genes whose protein products confer protection against the produced SMs (1). There are a variety of core genes, such as polyketide synthases (PKS), terpene synthases, and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) (16). The genes within these BGCs often vary considerably in terms of gene presence, absence, and orientation within and between species (15, 17) contributing to fungal ecological and chemical diversity (1).", "Identification of novel fungal SMs is a labor-intensive process consisting of isolation, purification, and structural elucidation of novel compounds (18). Novel fungal SMs are typically subjected to bioassays for the detection of specific biological activities (e.g., antifungal or antibacterial) (19), but the lack of systematic efforts in cataloging these bioactivity data limits their potential utility in large-scale analyses. More recently, the discovery of novel SMs in diverse organisms, including bacteria, plants, and fungi, has been accelerated by advances in genomic sequencing, genetic engineering, and bioinformatics. Advances in omics technologies have enabled the discovery of novel BGC-SM pairs through genomic manipulations and the utilization of heterologous expression to isolate SMs from unculturable species (20\u201322) and activation or increase in SM production through promoter engineering (23).", "The increasing number of characterized BGC-SM pairs from diverse organisms has led to the creation of large repositories such as the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster (MIBiG) database (24), which houses standardized annotations and metadata on BGC-SM pairs, increasing the efficiency of natural product discovery and facilitating additional analyses. In parallel, novel computational approaches, such as machine learning, are being employed to predict BGCs (25), like ClusterFinder (26); predict both BGCs and SM bioactivities, like DeepBGC (27); and predict biological activity from natural product chemistry (28, 29). For example, Walker and Clardy recently examined whether the bioactivity of natural products could be predicted from genetic data in bacteria (30).", "One appeal of using machine learning is that it enables the potential identification of specific genetic or chemical features associated with different bioactivity types. Since the protein products of genes in BGCs are involved in the biosynthesis of the SM structure and structure generally determines function, we expect that genes in BGCs may give insight and/or be predictive of SM bioactivity. Machine learning models can be generally divided into two main categories, supervised and unsupervised. Supervised models rely on labeled training data as input [e.g., random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR)], whereas unsupervised ones use unlabeled raw data (e.g., neural network, hidden Markov model) to enable predictions/classifications given sufficient data. Machine learning models have been successfully used to predict both genomic features (31) and phenotypic traits (32\u201334) and can be used with any type of biological, including genomic, data (35).", "In this work, we adapted machine learning models by Walker and Clardy that predict bacterial SM bioactivity from bacterial BGC data with accuracies as high as 80% (30) to test whether we could predict fungal SM bioactivity (Fig. 1). We trained the models to predict the antibacterial, antifungal, and cytotoxic/antitumor SM activity from BGC data using two training data sets: (i) fungal BGC data and (ii) fungal and bacterial BGC data. The models trained on the fungal data set (comprised of 314 BGCs) had balanced accuracies between 51% and 68%, and those trained on the fungal and bacterial data (comprised of 314 fungal and 1,003 bacterial BGCs) were between 56% and 68%. The lower balanced accuracies of our models compared to the models by Walker and Clardy (30) are likely due to the smaller size of the fungal data and the lack of informativeness of the bacterial data (for predicting fungal SM bioactivity). We conclude that the small number of fungal BGC-SM pairs with known bioactivities currently limits the use of artificial intelligence approaches for predicting SM bioactivity. Efforts that systematically catalog fungal SM bioactivity (including lack of bioactivity) and identify new BGC-SM pairs are needed.", "Fig 1Machine learning workflow to predict fungal secondary metabolite bioactivity.
