["Introduction", "Venomous organisms display a high level of diversification, both at the taxonomic and the functional levels (Casewell et al. 2013; Fry et al. 2015; Zancolli and Casewell 2020). The production of venom has been reported across at least 101 independent lineages in animals (Schendel et al. 2019), among which some well-known examples are snakes, spiders, and scorpions, with multiple instances of convergent evolution (King et al. 2008; Barua and Mikheyev 2019; Forde et al. 2022). Venom is a mix of toxins (mostly proteins and peptides) and other molecules, produced and stored in specialized anatomical structures of an organism and injected in another organism to disrupt its normal physiological processes (Fry et al. 2009). Venomous animals thus developed complex systems adapted to their target organisms, comprising not only toxic molecules but also the self-resistance mechanism needed to deal with their production, storage, and delivery, as well as specialized morphological structures including secretory glands and delivery weapons (Schendel et al. 2019). Venoms can be used for multiple purposes, including predation, defense, or intraspecific competition (Casewell et al. 2013). The specific functions of the toxins that compose the venoms are extremely diversified, and in most cases, toxins act synergistically to incapacitate the target organism by inducing paralysis through targeting neuromuscular receptors, causing blood loss by injecting anticoagulant, or causing intense pain by triggering pain receptors, among other mechanisms (Bohlen et al. 2011; Zancolli and Casewell 2020). Given the adaptive value of venom, understanding the origin and evolution of such diversified molecules and the organisms that produce them have become crucial in evolutionary biology.", "Neogastropoda is a group of hyperdiverse predatory marine mollusks. More than 15,000 species were described so far, representing 22% of the gastropod diversity (Lemarcis et al. 2022). Beside their high phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity, they are also characterized by a remarkable disparity in feeding strategies which include\u2014but are not restricted to\u2014envenomation, asphyxia, and vampirism (Taylor et al. 1980; Modica and Holford 2010; Olivera et al. 2017). Indeed, several neogastropod species were found to produce molecular compounds to subdue their preys (Modica et al. 2018; Turner et al. 2018), with Conus species undeniably representing the most studied lineage of neogastropods, and one of the gold standards in venom research. Cone snails represent around 1,000 species (WoRMS Editorial Board 2022), are widely distributed, and have different hunting targets (Zhao and Antunes 2022). Thus, more and more toxins (\u201cconotoxins\u201d) were found (\u223c200 toxins produced per species) in Conus species (Balaji et al. 2000; Buczek et al. 2005; Akondi et al. 2014), some of which entered clinical trials that, in one case, led to the market: the synthetic analog of a conotoxin, Ziconotide, is currently commercialized as an anesthetic (Layer and McIntosh 2006; Fedosov et al. 2012; Safavi-Hemami et al. 2019; Reynaud et al. 2020; Zhao and Antunes 2022).", "Conotoxins are small peptides (usually shorter than 40aa) and possess a conserved gene structure composed of an N-terminal signal sequence, a pro-region, and a mature peptide (Kaas et al. 2010; Puillandre et al. 2012; Fedosov et al. 2021). The majority of them are rich in cysteine residues, arranged in specific patterns (\u2018cysteine frameworks\u2019), resulting in disulfide bounds that determine the precise 3D conformation and high stability of the toxins themselves (Jin et al. 2019). Conotoxins were shown to have diverged, at least partly, through the onset of gene variants, especially due to insertions and deletions (Yang and Zhou 2020). Toxins closely related to conotoxins or sharing the same structural conformation were also found in other Conoidea (e.g., in Turridae, with longer mature peptide regions [Watkins et al. 2006], in Terebridae [Gorson et al. 2015], and in Drilliidae [Lu et al. 2020]). Beside conotoxins, a large variety of toxins were described in the Neogastropoda, acting as pore forming (e.g., colutoxins [Gerdol et al. 2018], hemolytic [e.g., echotoxins; Shiomi et al. 2002]) or anesthetic toxins like ShKT (Gerdol et al. 2019), to cite only few of their putative functions. Toxins were found in species belonging to multiple neogastropod families, including Babyloniidae, Muricidae, Buccinidae, Colubrariidae (Turner et al. 2018), Mitridae (Reynaud et al. 2020), and Costellaridae (Kuznetsova et al. 2022) but were reported in some of the closely related Caenogastropoda as well, namely the Tonnoidea families, Cassidae, Ranellidae, and Charoniidae (Hwang et al. 2021; Jia et al. 2022). However, the diversity of these toxins, the genomic mechanisms that may have triggered their evolution, and their potential adaptive and evolutionary implications remain understudied in non-Conoidea neogastropods. In particular, for a comprehensive evaluation of the molecular mechanisms of venom toxins evolution, a genomic perspective is indeed required. However, only a few comparative genomic studies are available to date on venomous organisms (Drukewitz and von Reumont 2019; Zancolli and Casewell 2020; Almeida et al. 2021; Barua and Mikheyev 2021; Koludarov et al. 2022), suggesting that duplication and neofunctionalization events constitute crucial steps in the onset of toxins from ancestral genes (Wong and Belov 2012; Giorgianni et al. 2020). If gene duplication can lead to evolutionary novelties even when restricted to a single gene (Magadum et al. 2013), large-scale duplication events indeed can dramatically increase the adaptative potential of species (Ren et al. 2018).", "Polyploidy or whole genome duplication (WGD) is a large-scale duplication event that generates additional copies of an entire genome within a species. This phenomenon is widespread in plant genomes (del Pozo and Ramirez-Parra 2015) but has also been recognized through multiple other eukaryotic lineages (Sankoff 2001). WGD is commonly followed by massive gene loss or duplication and other genomic rearrangements (S\u00e9mon and Wolfe 2007), which would imply the emergence of evolutionary novelties in such species. A hypothesis was suggested in a prior study that WGD may have taken place in Neogastropoda and some closely related superfamilies of Caenogastropoda. This was determined through a predictive model based on karyological data, which employed a likelihood method that modeled the background rate of chromosome number evolution as a birth-death process (Hallinan and Lindberg 2011). A recent publication confirmed WGD in Conus ventricosus genome, where 35 pseudochromosomes with a total genome size of 3.5\u2005Gb were described, evidenced by the presence of syntenic blocks with Pomacea canaliculata, an Ampullarioidea species, where one pseudochromosome of P. canaliculata represented two to four pseudochromosomes of C. ventricosus, a duplicated cluster of Hox genes, and a Ks (synonymous substitutions) distribution peak (Pardos-Blas et al. 2021).", "Given the high potential of WGD to foster diversification (Moriyama and Koshiba-Takeuchi 2018), it is crucial to understand whether this particular event is restricted to Conus or if it occurred in other lineages across the Neogastropoda, possibly related to the hyperdiversity of the entire group. To answer this question, high-quality genomes, assembled at the chromosomal level, are required.", "As sequencing cost is decreasing and sequencing quality is improving, it became easier to obtain chromosome-level assemblies in nonmodel organisms with the use of long-read technologies (PacBio or Nanopore) combined with Hi-C or Omni-C links (Ghurye et al. 2019). Thus, gastropod genomes are increasingly being sequenced, summing up to \u223c45 genomes, eight of which being of neogastropods (Stockwell et al. 2010; Hu et al. 2011; Barghi et al. 2016; Pardos-Blas et al. 2021; Peng et al. 2021); however, their taxonomic coverage is mostly restricted to Conoidea species, and their quality is uneven. The only available chromosome-level genome to date is from C. ventricosus (Pardos-Blas et al. 2021), even though the BUSCOs values for the annotation were low. Outside Neogastropoda, four Ampullarioidea species have good-quality genome assemblies (Sun et al. 2019), among which P. canaliculata is the only one with chromosome-level assembly, which makes it a good candidate for comparative analysis (Liu et al. 2018).", "Here, we generated chromosome-level assemblies of two additional gastropod species: Stramonita haemastoma (Linnaeus, 1767) from the neogastropod superfamily Muricoidea and Monoplex corrugatus (Lamarck, 1816), belonging to the Tonnoidea superfamily, closely related to the Neogastropoda (Lemarcis et al. 2022) and also including species able to produce venom (Bose et al. 2017). Both species are known to be venomous marine predators and are good candidates to unveil the molecular diversity of venomous gastropods, as they are taxonomically distant both from each other and from Conus (Lemarcis et al. 2022). We first investigated WGD in both genomes by analyzing synteny, hox gene clusters, and Ks distribution to confirm the taxonomic span of such event in Neogastropoda but also in Tonnoidea. Then, we looked for potential toxin-related genes in both genomes using toxin databases as Conoserver (Kaas et al. 2012). We also performed gene expression analysis of S. haemastoma genes in order to obtain insights about their evolutionary patterns."]
