["1. Introduction", "Members of the Streptomyces genus are widely known to be prolific producers of natural products. Many of these compounds have found widespread use in the pharmaceutical industry as antibiotics, immunosuppressant, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-parasitic drugs [1]. However, there continues to be an urgent need to discover new bioactive compounds, and especially antibiotics, primarily due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in clinically important bacterial pathogens [2,3]. In particular, the increase in multi-resistant ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) has focused research efforts to develop new antibiotics to treat these priority antibiotic-resistant bacteria [4].", "Up until relatively recently, marine ecosystems had largely been neglected as a potential source for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds, in comparison to terrestrial environments, primarily due to issues of accessibility [5]. Marine sponges are known to host a variety of different bacteria and fungi, which produce a diverse range of natural products, including compounds with antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antibacterial, and anticancer activities [5,6]. Marine sponge-associated Streptomyces spp. are a particularly important source of bioactive compounds, with examples including Streptomyces sp. HB202, isolated from the sponge Halichondria panicea, which produces mayamycin, a compound with activity against Staphylococcus aureus [7]; and streptophenazines G and K, with activity against Bacillus subtilis [8]; together with Streptomyces sp. MAPS15, which was isolated from Spongia officinalis, which produces 2-pyrrolidine, with activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae [9]. Additionally, our group has reported the production of antimycins from Streptomyces sp. SM8 isolated from the sponge Haliclona simulans, with antifungal and antibacterial activities [10,11]. In further work, we genetically characterised 13 Streptomyces spp. that were isolated from both shallow and deep-sea sponges, which displayed antimicrobial activities against a number of clinically relevant bacterial and yeast species [12,13]. Amongst these strains, the Streptomyces sp. SM17 demonstrated an ability to inhibit the growth of E. coli NCIMB 12210, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Candida spp., when employing deferred antagonism assays [12,13].", "Among other clinically relevant natural products derived from marine Streptomyces isolates are the recently identified surugamides family of molecules. The cyclic octapeptide surugamide A and its derivatives were originally identified in the marine-derived Streptomyces sp. JAMM992 [14], and have been shown to belong to a particularly interesting family of compounds due not only to their relevant bioactivity, but also due to their unusual metabolic pathway involving D-amino acids [14,15,16]. Since their discovery, concerted efforts have been employed in order to chemically characterise these compounds and determine the genetic mechanisms involved in their production [14,15,17,18,19,20]. The surugamides and their derivatives have been shown to possess a number of bioactivities, with the surugamides A\u2013E and the surugamides G\u2013J being shown to possess anticancer activity by inhibiting bovine cathepsin B, a cysteine protease reported to be involved in the invasion of metastatic tumour cells [14,16]; while another derivative, namely acyl-surugamide A, has been shown to possess anti-fungal activity [16]. It has been determined that the non-ribosomal peptide synthase-encoding surABCD genes are the main biosynthetic genes involved in the biosynthesis of surugamides and their derivatives [19], with these genes being involved in the production of at least 20 different compounds [16]. Surugamides A\u2013E have been reported to be produced by the surA and surD genes, while the linear decapeptide surugamide F has been shown to be produced by the surB and surC genes, involving a unique pattern of intercalation of the biosynthetic genes [19]. Further metabolic pathways studies have reported that the expression of the surABCD gene cluster is strongly regulated by the surR transcriptional repressor [16], while the cyclisation of the cyclic surugamides has been shown to involve a penicillin binding protein (PBP)-like thioesterase encoded by the surE gene [17,18,21].", "Although apparently widespread in marine-derived Streptomyces isolates [18,19], the production of surugamides has also been reported in the S. albidoflavus strain J1074 [16,22], a derivative of the soil isolate S. albus G [23,24]. The S. albidoflavus strain J1074 is a well-characterised Streptomyces isolate, which is frequently used as a model for the genus and has commonly been successfully employed in the heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) [25,26,27,28,29]. This strain was originally classified as an S. albus isolate, however, due to more recent taxonomy studies, it has been reclassified as a S. albidoflavus species isolate [30,31]. Interestingly, surugamides and their derivatives have been shown to only be produced by S. albidoflavus J1074 under specific conditions, such as when employing chemical stress elicitors [16], and more recently when cultivating the strain in a soytone-based liquid-based medium SG2 [22].", "In a previous study [32], we reported that the S. albidoflavus J1074 and Streptomyces sp. SM17 possessed morphological and genetic similarities. Differences were observed, however, when both strains were exposed to high salt concentrations using culture media, such as TSB or ISP2, in which the marine sponge-derived strain SM17 grew and differentiated more rapidly in comparison with the soil strain S. albidoflavus J1074, which appeared to have trouble growing and differentiating when salts were present in the growth medium [32]. Genome mining based on the prediction of secondary metabolites BGCs also showed many similarities between the two strains [32]. Among these predicted BGCs, both the S. albidoflavus J1074 and Streptomyces sp. SM17 isolates appeared to possess the sur BGC, encoding for the production of surugamides A/D. Due to the fact that marine-derived Streptomyces isolates have been shown to produce good levels of surugamides when grown under standard conditions [18,19], and that production of surugamides and derivatives can be induced in the presence of chemical stress elicitors in S. albidoflavus J1074 [16], it appears likely that marine-derived Streptomyces isolates and their sur BGCs could share genetic similarities that might help to optimise production of the compound. To investigate this possibility we 1) employed genome mining approaches together with phylogenomics in order to better characterise the SM17 strain, and to investigate the distribution and differences/similarities between marine- (or aquatic saline-) and terrestrial-derived sur BGCs and sur BGC-harbouring microorganisms; and 2) experimentally compared the metabolic profiles of surugamide A production between a marine (SM17) and a terrestrial (J1074) Streptomyces isolate. With respect to the latter, we employed an \"one strain many compounds\" (OSMAC)-based approach, which has been shown to be a useful strategy in eliciting production of natural products from silent gene clusters by employing different culture conditions [33,34]; together with analytical chemistry methods such as liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry to monitor production of surugamide A in both S. albidoflavus J1074 and Streptomyces sp.
