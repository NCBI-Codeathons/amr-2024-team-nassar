["INTRODUCTION", "Phenazines are heterocyclic N-containing redox natural products with a wide range of biological activities, including antimicrobial and antitumor activities (1\u20133). Further, phenazines play an important role in the persistence and survival of their producers in the rhizosphere (4\u20136). The first identified phenazine, pyocyanin, was followed by the identification of >180 natural phenazines, mainly produced by Pseudomonas and Streptomyces (1, 3). A widely known and studied phenazine, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), from Pseudomonas spp. was registered as a biopesticide in China in 2011. The compound is commercially called Shenqinmycin and effectively prevents and controls various fungal, bacterial, and nematode diseases (7, 8). Other active natural phenazines could also be developed as biopesticides.", "Lysobacter is a Gram-negative bacterial genus that includes species that produce many active extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolites. Members of this genus have recently attracted considerable attention as sources of biocontrol agents (9\u201311). Our previous study isolated six phenazines from Lysobacter antibioticus OH13, and the phenazine N-oxide myxin exhibited strong antimicrobial activity (12, 13). Myxin is a heterocyclic aromatic N-oxide, a chemical class rarely found in the environment, and can cause DNA damage when bioreductively activated (14, 15).", "High concentrations of myxin are toxic to L. antibioticus OH13, the strain that produces the chemical. Thus, self-toxicity may limit the production of myxin. Antibiotic-producing microorganisms exhibit multiple resistance mechanisms to prevent self-toxicity effects, such as antibiotic efflux, inactivation, and target repair or protection (16). Recently, we identified a resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) efflux pump, LexABC (17), and a monooxygenase, LaPhzX (18), involved in self-resistance to myxin in L. antibioticus OH13.", "RND efflux pumps in Gram-negative bacteria exhibit a wide spectrum of substrates and have an important role in bacterial multidrug resistance. These efflux pumps consist of three proteins: an inner membrane RND transporter, outer membrane protein, and plasma membrane fusion protein (19, 20). Twelve RND efflux pumps are recognized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 11 are capable of multidrug efflux, including MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, MexXY, and MexGHI-OpmD. These pumps are responsible for \u03b2-lactam, aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, and phenazine efflux (19, 21). RND efflux pumps are often regulated by two-component systems and individual TetR, LysR, MarR, and AraC family proteins (22). LysR-type transcriptional regulators are abundant in bacteria. The MexEF-OprN RND efflux pump from P. aeruginosa can be activated by MexT, a transcriptional regulator of this family. Activation occurs when cells encounter electrophilic substances, and regulation depends on the presence of a putative quinol monooxygenase (PA2048) and quinone oxidoreductase (MexS) (23, 24). AmpR, another member of the LysR family, regulates non-\u03b2-lactam antibiotic resistance by modulating the MexEF-OprN efflux pump (25). Yet another LysR-type transcriptional regulator, AdeL, negatively regulates the AdeFGH RND efflux system (26). LysR regulators involved in RND efflux pump expression are ubiquitous, but their molecular mechanisms and responses to antibiotics are not clear.", "In L. antibioticus OH13, deletion of lexABC genes greatly increases the susceptibility of strains to myxin and decreases myxin production, and the expression of lexABC is induced by myxin. A putative LysR family protein-encoding gene, lexR, located upstream of lexABC, decreases myxin resistance and production when mutated. A deletion mutant of lexR causes downregulation of lexABC (17). LexR positively regulates the LexABC pump, although its action on a molecular scale has not been determined. We elucidated its mechanism of action, and we explain mechanisms behind the myxin upregulation of lexABC expression. These findings confirm the regulation of myxin efflux and provide insight into the self-resistance mechanism against myxin."]
