["Introduction", "The Bacillus cereus group is composed of seven species of low G+C Gram-positive spore-forming bacteria, which based on 16S rRNA sequence data form a separate cluster in the phylogenetic tree of Bacillaceae and Firmicutes [1]. The B. cereus group includes B. cereus (sensu stricto), B. anthracis, and B. thuringiensis, which are all well studied and are pathogens of animals, humans or insects, as well as B. weihenstephanensis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides and B. cytotoxicus. The different species can commonly, but with variable frequency, be found in the soil environment, and can thus constitute polluter organisms in food production facilities and dairies, as well as in hospitals [2, 3]. Bacteria within the B. cereus group have also been suggested to naturally inhabit the insect gut [4].", "The pathogenic species of the B. cereus group have different host preferences, mainly due to traits encoded on plasmids. B. anthracis is the cause of anthrax, primarily an animal disease but also occasionally of humans, due to its production of anthrax-specific toxins (lethal and edema toxins) and a poly-\u03b3-D-glutamate capsule which provides protection against the host immune system. B. anthracis is endemic in several parts of the world [5]. The three toxin genes (pag, lef and cya) are located on a plasmid, pXO1 (189 kb), while the genes necessary for capsule synthesis, capABCD, are located on plasmid pXO2 (95 kb), and fully virulent B. anthracis strains carry both plasmids. B. cereus sensu stricto (here called B. cereus) is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing a range of diseases [2, 6], most prominently foodborne disease due to the production of enterotoxins (diarrhoeal syndrome) or a non-ribosomally synthesized dodecadepsipeptide toxin (emetic syndrome). The emetic toxin is encoded by genes on a large 270 kb plasmid, pCER270 [7, 8]. Interestingly, B. cereus strains causing anthrax-like disease were isolated from welders in the US and shown to carry a plasmid highly similar to pXO1 [9], as well as from African great apes (Cameroon, Ivory Coast), shown to carry full pXO1 and pXO2 virulence plasmids [10, 11]. B. thuringiensis strains produce proteinaceous crystal toxins (Cry or Cyt toxin) during sporulation which are the primary cause of their toxicity toward insects, and which are encoded by genes most often located on plasmids. B. thuringiensis strains do however, also carry the chromosomal enterotoxin genes found in B. cereus, and the two species are genetically indistinguishable based on chromosomal characters [12, 13]. Many of the chromosomally encoded virulence factors in B. cereus and B. thuringiensis are positively regulated at the transcriptional level by the PlcR-PapR peptide-based quorum sensing system. The plcR gene is also present in B. anthracis strains, but carries a deleterious mutation making the protein non-functional and leaving the PlcR regulated genes non-transcribed [14].", "Given that different species within the B. cereus group have diverse toxic effects and host specificities, but are closely related at the phylogenetic level, their intra- and inter-species diversity has frequently been studied at the genome level. Large-scale sequencing studies of B. cereus group strains have allowed the calculation of a core genome of genes shared between all strains (aproximately 1750 genes), and a set of additional genes found in almost every genome, constituting the extended core (approximately 2150 genes) [15]. The B. cereus group core genome appears to harbour a high number of genes encoding transporter proteins. This may reflect the fact that B. cereus group bacteria are frequently found in environments such as soil, which display high variability with respect to potential nutrients and exposure to toxic chemicals, including antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents. Putative efflux pumps appear to be particularly common within the genomes of the B. cereus group but relatively few of these transporters have been functionally characterised to date. In contrast, the model organism Bacillus subtilis encodes some of the best characterised multidrug efflux pumps in bacteria, including the related Bmr and Blt transporters from the major facilitator superfamily [16\u201318].", "Bacterial drug efflux pumps generally fall into one of five families or superfamilies of transport proteins, the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, the resistance/nodulation/division (RND) superfamily, the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family and the small multidrug resistance superfamily (SMR). A sixth family of multidrug efflux pumps, the Proteobacterial antimicrobial compound extrusion (PACE) family was recently identified [19, 20]. However, genes encoding PACE family proteins have been identified in the genome sequences of a small number of species outside the Proteobacteria.", "Here we describe the putative efflux pumps carried by B. cereus group isolates that fall within each of the five major families of transport proteins. The number of pumps, their putative substrates and conservation across the group is described, followed by a detailed review of the efflux systems encoded by the B. cereus type strain, ATCC 14579. The transcriptional responses of selected conserved pumps encoded by this strain to a panel of structurally and mechanistically diverse drugs or stress conditions were determined to gain insight into their potential functional roles."]
