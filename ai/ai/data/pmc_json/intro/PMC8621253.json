["1. Introduction", "Pseudomonas protegens is a soil-dwelling bacterium characterized by an increasing scientific and industrial interest as a growth promoting agent for cultivated plants [1]. Like other pseudomonad species, this bacterium is able to colonize the rhizosphere favoring biochemical mechanisms increasing the availability of soil nutrients to the plant. In addition, pseudomonads can act indirectly (plant resistance induction) and directly (i.e., antibiosis) against phytopathogens [2]. The direct action against plant pathogens relies on the production of diverse compounds such as 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), orfamide A, pyoluteorin, pyrrolnitrin, rhizoxin derivatives, toxoflavin, and several enzymes [3]. While some of these metabolites may also have a toxic or inhibitory action against insect pests affecting crops, several Pseudomonas species have developed particular toxins and virulence factors to act more specifically against insects. One of the most studied members of this bacterial genus is P. entomophila that acts by ingestion against susceptible targets leveraging a specific toxin secretion system [4]. Similarly, diverse species in the P. fluorescens group may act as insect pathogens [5]. However, those belonging to the sub-clade 1, including P. protegens, seems to have developed specific gene traits associated with the insecticidal properties [6]. Recent studies have documented an oral infection process implying a fluorescent insecticidal toxin (Fit) complex showing similarity with the makes caterpillars floppy (Mcf) toxin found in the entomopathogenic nematode symbiont Photorhabdus luminescens [7]. However, P. protegens mutants lacking the functionality of the gene complex fit were observed to be still active against fruit flies, thus supporting the involvement of other insecticidal compounds [8]. In the light of the few studies available, the mechanism of action of P. protegens on susceptible insects still appears to be poorly understood. In order to increase understanding of P. protegens target range and entomopathogenic mode of action, we conducted bioassays on different muscoid fly larvae investigating the possible involvement of genes encoding for some putative protein toxins and virulence factors. For this purpose, gene expression profile was studied at the transcriptional level after oral administration of a new strain of the bacterium. Because target genes are in common between different P. protegens strains, the output of this study is useful to deepen the knowledge also of other strains of this species."]
