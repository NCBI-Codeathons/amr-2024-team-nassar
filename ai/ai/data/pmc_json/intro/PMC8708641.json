["1. Introduction", "Myxobacteria are a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria that display a variety of unusual \u201cbehavioral\u201d traits, such as coordinated swarming and the formation of macroscopic, multicellular fruiting bodies [1,2]. In addition to their unique \u201csocial behavior\u201d, myxobacteria are also a viable source for a multitude of natural products, exhibiting diverse biological activities due to their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC)-rich genomes [3]. The majority of myxobacterial secondary metabolites known to date derive from huge biosynthetic enzyme complexes, such as modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), polyketide synthase (PKS) and hybrids thereof, while natural products from other biosynthetic machineries have been isolated less frequently [4]. One of the reasons for this finding is that the discovery of natural products has shifted from a \u201cgrind and find\u201d approach towards a more genome-guided discovery of microbial natural products [5]. This approach mostly relies on bioinformatics tools such as the \u201cantibiotics and secondary metabolite analysis shell\u201d (antiSMASH), allowing genome-wide identification and analysis of BGCs [6]. In contrast to NRPS and PKS gene clusters, which encode large enzyme complexes containing catalytic domains with high sequence homology, other types of BGCs, such as ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) BGCs, are more difficult to identify and annotate as they are usually encoded by small, oftentimes poorly conserved open reading frames (ORFs) [7].", "Although several bioinformatics tools have recently been developed [8,9,10,11,12,13] or successively updated [14] to allow for the automated detection of certain classes of RiPPs, there is likely still an abundance of yet-undiscovered RiPPs that may have been overlooked in the past [15]. Since the fulvocins [16,17], xanthacin [18], the crocagins [19,20] and the cittilins [21,22,23] are the only myxobacterial RiPPs that have been identified and partly characterized up to date, myxobacteria likely provide an underexploited reservoir for the discovery of new RiPPs. Among these few known myxobacterial RiPPs, the biosynthesis of the cittilins is remarkable, since it only requires a 27-amino-acid precursor peptide which is enzymatically modified by the cytochrome-P450-dependent enzyme CitB to form a bridged tetrapeptide containing a biaryl and an aryl-oxy-aryl link [21].", "In a recent study, the biosynthetic genes of a natural product family closely related to the cittilins, termed biarylitides, were initially found in Planomonospora strains, but further in silico analysis revealed that these minimal RiPP BGCs also appear in several other genera, including the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus sp. CA032A. Similar to the bridging mechanism observed in cittilin biosynthesis, these biarylitides also contain a biaryl linkage between two aromatic amino acids introduced by a cytochrome-P450-dependent enzyme [24]. This natural product class features an unprecedented RiPP biosynthesis, as it is produced from a precursor peptide encoded by an ORF termed bytA that encodes a five-amino-acid substrate. Biosynthetically characterized members of the biarylitide family, such as biarylitide YYH and YFH, are exclusively N-acetylated tripeptides with a C\u2013C biaryl crosslink between the aromatic side chains of amino acids one and three.", "Consequently, the combined evaluation of genome and metabolome data covering myxobacteria led to the discovery and elucidation of the full structure, via spectroscopic techniques such as 2D NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry, of the first myxobacterial biarylitide MeYLH (1) and its semi-synthetic Boc derivative (2), which we named Myxarylin and Myxarylin-Boc, respectively (Figure 1). In contrast to previous members of the biarylitide family, 1 features an N-methylated tripeptide with a C\u2013N biaryl crosslink. Additionally, the formation of 1 was confirmed by the heterologous expression of the identified biosynthetic genes in Myxococcus xanthus DK1622."]
