["1. Introduction", "Bacteria that are resistant to clinically relevant antibiotics are a major threat to public health worldwide. Factors leading to this crisis, such as the lack of research and development of novel antibiotics, have been examined elsewhere [1,2,3]. The recent global status of antibiotics has been documented in a policy document issued by the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy (CDDEP) [4]. The development of antibiotics was rapid between 1940\u20131962, when 20 clinically relevant classes were discovered and developed; only two major novel classes have been commercialized since 1962. Large pharmaceutical companies in recent decades have committed scant resources to antibiotics [5], as drugs treating lifestyle diseases yield more sustainable profits. Meanwhile, academic scientists, smaller companies, non-profits, and academic-industry partnerships have brought about significant developments in the fields of antibiotics and antimicrobial strategies.", "For example, the tuberculosis-focused TB Alliance initiated Phase I trials for TBA-7371, which belongs to a new class of compounds called DprE1 inhibitors that block the enzyme decaprenylphosphoryl-\u03b2-d-ribose 2\u2032-epimerase (DprE1) in the cell wall biosynthesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Only two TB drugs have been approved for clinical use in recent years, namely, Johnson and Johnson\u2019s bedaquiline and Otsuka Pharmaceutical\u2019s delamanid, both for treating multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. More needs to be done on this front as resistance to known drugs is rising. A new business model for the development of antibiotics that is not dependent on high returns from the large volume product sales has been advocated [6]. This article offers snapshots from the gamut of recent antimicrobial science and technology, including antimicrobial discovery strategies, novel antibiotic types, newer antimicrobial materials, emerging commercial technology platforms, and microbial ecology management, including microbiome interventions. This article is restricted to developments mainly arising in the last decade, and earlier approaches that are being revived due to increasing antibiotic resistance."]
