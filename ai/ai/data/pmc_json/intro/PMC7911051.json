["1. Introduction", "Bacillus cereus is estimated to be responsible for 1.4%\u201312% of all food poisoning outbreaks worldwide [1]. In the European Union, bacterial toxins (Clostridium, Staphylococcus and B. cereus) accounted for 17.7% (2016) and 15.9% (2017) of all registered food- and water-borne outbreaks, which ranked them second behind Salmonella [2,3]. With 98 registered outbreaks in the EU in 2018, B. cereus toxins ranked in fifth place behind Salmonella, Campylobacter, the norovirus and Staphylococcus toxins. Among these was also one large food poisoning outbreak with more than 100 affected persons. Furthermore, six fatal cases were attributed to bacterial toxins (Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium perfringens and B. cereus) [4].", "Basically, B. cereus is responsible for two types of gastrointestinal diseases. The emetic kind of illness is mainly characterized by nausea and emesis, which appear as soon as half an hour after consumption of the contaminated food and are clinically indistinguishable from intoxications with Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins [5]. In this classical food intoxication, the emetic toxin cereulide is pre-formed during vegetative growth of B. cereus in foodstuffs and the consumption of the bacteria is not necessary [6]. Indeed, there are several reports of outbreaks where only the cereulide toxin was detected in the food, but no bacteria could be isolated [7]. Nevertheless, it is generally thought that at least 103\u2013105\nB. cereus per g food are needed to produce cereulide in disease-provoking concentrations [5,6,7,8,9]. Cereulide is a cyclic dodecadepsipeptide with a molecular weight of 1.2 kDa. The basic repeated amino acid sequence [D-O-Leu D-Ala L-O-Val D-Val]3 is extremely stable towards heat, acid or digestive enzymes and, thus, the toxin can hardly be removed or inactivated [10,11,12]. Usually, the emetic form of disease is self-limiting and symptoms disappear after 6\u201324 h. Nevertheless, some severe and fatal outbreaks mostly related to liver failure are reported [10,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Due to the ubiquitous nature of the pathogen and its production of highly resistant spores, B. cereus is frequently found in various kinds of food [24,25,26]. Historically, starchy foodstuffs such as rice or pasta are connected to food intoxications with emetic B. cereus, but more recently evidence is growing that emetic B. cereus are much more volatile than once thought. The comprehensive analysis of a total of 3654 food samples obtained from suspected food-borne illnesses with a preliminary report of vomiting, collected over a period of seven years, revealed that emetic B. cereus strains were detected in a broad diversity of foods, including vegetables, fruit products, sauces, soups, and salads as well as milk and meat products [7].", "The second, diarrheal form of food poisoning is also associated with a variety of different foodstuffs [27]. This form of disease manifests mainly in diarrhea and abdominal cramps, similar to food poisoning by Clostridium perfringens type A [5]. Symptoms occur after approximately 8\u201316 h. This incubation time is typical for toxico-infections, in which the toxins are produced by viable bacteria inside the human intestine [5,28,29]. Unlike cereulide, enterotoxins pre-formed in foods most likely do not contribute to the disease, as they are considered sensitive towards heat, acids or proteases. Thus, vegetative B. cereus and, especially, spores must be consumed. The infective dose is estimated between 105\u2013108 cfu/g [11,30] or 104\u2013109 cfu/g [9,29] vegetative cells or spores. The course of disease is mainly mild and\u2014after approximately 12\u201324 h\u2014self-limiting. Fatal outbreaks are only very rarely reported [31]. A food infection with enteropathogenic B. cereus can be seen as a multifactorial process, as a number of individual steps have to be considered before the onset of the disease, including prevalence and survival of B. cereus in different foodstuffs, survival of the stomach passage, germination of spores, active movement towards and adhesion to the intestinal epithelium, enterotoxin production under intestinal conditions, as well as the influence of consumed foods and the intestinal microbiota on these processes. We recently summarized these steps in a separate review [27]. Nevertheless, production and action of the enterotoxins are of the upmost relevance for the course of the diarrheal disease. Three main, pore-forming protein enterotoxins are known, which are the tripartite hemolysin BL (Hbl) [32] and non-hemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) [33], as well as the single protein cytotoxin K (CytK) [31]. Progress made in studies from the early 1990s until today on highly variable, strain-specific enterotoxin production (distribution, genetic organization, gene expression and toxin secretion), as well as on the mode of action and the effects on target cells of these pore-forming enterotoxins, is depicted in detail in the present review. The two three-component enterotoxin complexes Hbl and Nhe are the focus of attention. In addition, the latest findings regarding cereulide and CytK are also summarized, as well as known methods for toxin detection and prevention of illness, and the possible contribution of further secreted virulence factors to the diarrheal form of disease."]
