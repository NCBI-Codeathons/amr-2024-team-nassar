["Introduction", "Organosulfur compounds exhibit unique chemical properties due to the features of the inherent sulfur heteroatom and the arising reactivity. Sulfur is a third-period element and occupies the 3s, 3p, and sometimes 3d orbitals that are significantly larger than the second period elements orbitals (2s, 2p) such as oxygen or nitrogen. Additionally, sulfur is much less electronegative and organosulfur compounds with oxidation state +II, +IV, and +VI and coordination numbers from 0 to 7 are known (Block, 1978). Sulfonamides and sulfamates are organosulfur compounds that carry a sulfamoyl group represented by a tetrahedral sulfur atom connected to two oxygen, and one amine functionality (R1SO2NR22, R1 = alkyl, aryl, R2 = alkyl, aryl, or H). Whereas the sulfur atom is linked to an alkyl residue via a S\u2013C bond for sulfonamides, sulfamates exhibit an S\u2013O bond connecting the sulfamoyl group to an alkoxy residue. Sulfonamides are the amido analogs of sulfonic acids and the sulfur atom exhibits a +IV oxidation state. Sulfamates, on the other hand, can be regarded as the alkyl esters of sulfamic acid and are therefore the amido analogs of alkyl sulfates, exhibiting a sulfur atom in oxidation state +VI (Fig.\u00a01).", "Fig. 1.Structural relationships of sulfonamides and sulfamates.", "Structural relationships of sulfonamides and sulfamates.", "Sulfonamides and sulfamates constitute a diverse family of highly pharmacologically active compounds and many clinically used drugs contain the signature sulfamoyl structural motif. Sulfonamides are widely known as synthetic \u201csulfa drugs\u201d, and were the first chemotherapeutically used antibacterial compounds, represented by the most famous drug Prontosil (Brooks, 1989). Prontosil structurally resembles p-aminobenzoic acid, the native substrate of the dihydropteroate synthase, a key enzyme in bacterial folate biosynthesis (Ferone, 1977). A plethora of synthetic sulfamoyl containing compounds have been synthesized and drugs functioning as diuretics, uricosurics, hypoglycemic treatments, or antimicrobial have been developed (Brooks, 1989). While sulfonamides and sulfamates are mainly known as synthetic compounds, intriguingly, several examples were also discovered from natural sources (Petkowski et\u00a0al., 2018). The majority of these secondary metabolites are produced by actinomycetes, and primary sulfamates such as nucleocidin and dealanylascamycin (AT265), the primary sulfonamide altemicidin, the secondary sulfamates, ascamycin and sulphostin, the secondary sulfonamides SB-203207 and SB-203208, and the tertiary sulfonamide sulfadixiamycin A have been isolated (Fig.\u00a02). Since the revolution of natural product sciences, caused by the development of genome and transcriptome sequencing technologies, the investigation and discovery of the genetic and biochemical basis of natural products biosynthesis opened the door for the development of novel drugs and drug leads by biosynthetic engineering. Given the pharmaceutical importance of sulfamoyl containing compounds such as sulfonamides and sulfamates, we here aim to summarize the current state of knowledge on sulfonamide and sulfamate biosynthesis in actinomycete. As the main topic of this review is the biosynthetic reaction for S\u2013N bond formation, see Waldman et\u00a0al. (2017) for the overview of heteroatom\u2013heteroatom bond forming reaction in nature.", "Fig. 2.The structures of sulfamate and sulfonamide compounds from actinomycete.", "The structures of sulfamate and sulfonamide compounds from actinomycete."]
