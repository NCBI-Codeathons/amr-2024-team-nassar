["1. Introduction", "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous condition, generally affecting older individuals [1]. The ineligibility of such patients to intesive chemotherapy has led to the search for newer therapies in recent years. One such example of a newer combination of hypomethylating agents (HMAs) and a selective oral BCL-2 inhibitor (Venetoclax, Ven) has made significant strides and gained FDA approval in recent years [2].", "HMAs, such as 5-azacytidine (Aza) and decitabine (Dec), function by promoting the blocking of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). This process results in the demethylation of CpG islands [3] and an increase in the expression of genes necessary for normal myeloid hematopoiesis. HMAs, thus, play an integral role in the treatment of myelodysplastic neoplasms and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), when cellular differentiation blocks arrest maturation [4,5,6].", "Normal cellular senescence via apoptosis, regulated by a balance between pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak, Bad, Bid, Puma, Bim, Noxa) and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1), is lost among cancer cells, characterized by increased expression of anti-apoptotic protiens [7]. An anti-apoptotic protein prevents apoptosis by binding to and clearing pro-apoptotic proteins.", "In 2014, Pan et al. [8] showed the efficacy of Ven (ABT-199), a potent, selective oral inhibitor of BCL-2, on multiple AML cell lines and patient-derived xenografts at nanomolar concentrations. Notably, the cytotoxic effects of Ven (Venetoclax) were predominantly unaffected by mutational status and were sustained in primary AML blast cells that were resistant to chemotherapy. In a phase II clinical trial, Konopleva et al. [9] showed evidence for the efficacy of Ven monotherapy (19% overall response rate), particularly among patients with IDH1/2 mutations.", "A phase 3 trial, the VIALE-A study, further explored the combination of these two agents in newly diagnosed older or unfit adults with AML. It showed high rates of composite complete remission in two-thirds of patients and superior survival and manageable toxicity with a combination of Ven + Aza, leading to the combination\u2019s FDA approval in 2020 [2,10]. The combinatorial regimen has been successful in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML as well as among younger AML populations [11,12,13,14,15]. Understandably, there is widespread adoption and increasing usage of this highly effective regimen; however, the mechanisms behind the combination\u2019s synergy are poorly understood.", "In this review, we summarize the resistance mechanism to Ven or HMA monotherapy and highlight the putative synergistic mechanisms of the Ven\u2013HMA combination in preclinical studies. We also review molecular signatures that predict clinical response to the Ven\u2013HMA combination."]
