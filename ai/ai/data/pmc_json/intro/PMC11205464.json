["1. Introduction", "Actinomycetes are known for their potential to synthesize bioactive secondary metabolites (also known as natural products) that serve as major sources of agricultural and medical drugs, such as antibiotics and antifungal, antitumor, antiviral, antiparasitic, and immunosuppressive compounds [1,2], accounting for approximately 45% of the secondary metabolites of microbial origin [3]. The genus Streptomyces is considered the most effective producer of bioactive natural products widely used in clinical practice, such as streptomycin, kanamycin and vancomycin [4]. To date, more than 70% of currently known natural antibiotics from microorganisms are produced by Streptomyces species [5,6,7]. However, with the isolation of a large number of secondary metabolites, the probability of finding antibiotics with significant biological activity and novel structures from Streptomyces is decreased [8,9]. This has led to a shift in focus to unexplored, underexploited and/or extreme habitats for isolating novel actinobacteria, particularly novel Streptomyces species [10]. In addition, the development of new genetic tools and fermentation strategies is pursued to facilitate natural product discovery in the genus Streptomyces [11].", "Due to their remote and isolated geographic locations and extreme and hostile environments, the Arctic and Antarctic regions are regarded as valuable places for the isolation of novel microorganisms. A large number of novel actinobacteria, including Streptomyces species, have been detected in Arctic and Antarctic environments [12,13,14,15]. In addition, to adapt to extreme conditions such as low temperature, polar days and strong ultraviolet radiation [16], microorganisms inhabiting Arctic and Antarctic environments have evolved unique gene regulations and metabolic functions and therefore have the potential to produce structurally novel secondary metabolites [17,18]. Secondary metabolites with unique structures and significant activities, including actinomycin V, cinerubin B [19], enterocin [20] and frigocyclinone [21], have been found in Streptomyces species isolated from Arctic and Antarctic habitats.", "Recent advances in genome mining have promoted the discovery of natural products from microorganisms [22]. The genetic elements responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites are usually clustered in microbial genomes to form gene clusters. Genome mining has become an important approach to explore novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from isolated strains or to isolate new bioactive microbial strains from the environment to find novel BGCs [23]. These novel BGCs have great potential for the production of novel natural products. In recent years, with the increase in the number of Streptomyces genomes published, Streptomyces genomes have been confirmed to contain a wide range of undiscovered BGCs, which can serve as an invaluable source for the discovery of novel drug leads [24]. Furthermore, a large number of novel BGCs have been discovered in the genomes of Streptomyces species originating from Arctic and Antarctic habitats [25,26,27], indicating that Streptomyces strains in polar regions have strong potential for containing new secondary metabolites. Therefore, identifying novel Streptomyces species in polar regions can provide a basis for mining novel genetic sources for new natural products.", "In the present study, the bacterial strain 21So2-11 isolated from soil on the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, was assigned to the genus Streptomyces and further identified as a novel species based on genomic analysis. Secondary metabolite BGCs in the genome of strain 21So2-11 were predicted and further compared with those of Streptomyces species originating from polar regions with genome data available in public databases to evaluate the potential for producing novel bioactive compounds found in Streptomyces species inhabiting Arctic and Antarctic environments."]
