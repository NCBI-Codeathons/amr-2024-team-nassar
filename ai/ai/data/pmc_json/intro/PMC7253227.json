["Introduction", "The Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities are microbial ecosystems that dominate the biology of most ice-free areas in Continental Antarctica. They were described for the first time in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Southern Victoria Land [1], the largest ice-free area of the continent. The McMurdo Dry Valleys are a nearly pristine environment largely undisturbed and uncontaminated by humans and show remarkable peculiarities, representing an important analogue for the conditions of ancient Earth and Mars and a model environment for astrobiological studies [2\u20137]. These ice-free areas, dominated mostly by oligotrophic mineral soil and rocky outcrops [8, 9], due to the harshest conditions such as low temperatures (always below the freezing point) [10], strong and rapid thermal fluctuations, dryness, oligotrophy and high UV radiation, are dominated by cryptic microbial life-forms dwelling inside rocks [11]. For their unique geological and biological peculiarities, the McMurdo Dry Valleys, as a whole, are now designated as an ASMA (Antarctic Specially Managed Area), to assist planning and coordination of activities, improving cooperation between parties and minimise environmental impacts [12] and include five different ASPA (Antarctic Specially Protected Areas) to protect outstanding environments that require specific permits for entry. There, the prohibitive conditions are incompatible with active life on rock surfaces, and endolithic adaptation confers to microbes the chance to exploit a more protected niche inside rock porosity characterized by a milder and more stable microclimate [13\u201315]. Many different typologies of endolithic microbial communities have been described but the most complex and widespread in these areas are surely the cryptoendolithic lichen-dominated communities [1]. These are complex and self-supporting assemblages of phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms, including Bacteria, Chlorophyta and both free-living and lichen-forming fungi [1, 16] and, living at the edge of their physiological adaptability, represent the only chance for survival before extinction [11, 17].", "The effect of global warming is dramatically intense at the Poles [18] and disturbance due to climate change may have irreversible effects on the weak equilibrium of these highly adapted microbial communities [19\u201321], but sensitive to any external perturbation [22]. Thus, improving our knowledge on functional capacity and multiple stress-responses of these ultimate ecosystems will give us important clues for monitoring and predicting any future variation due to climate change [19, 23]. Recent studies investigate the biodiversity of the McMurdo Dry Valleys [16, 24\u201327] and provided new insights on how the combination of environmental parameters of altitude and sea distance influence the distribution and the settlement of cryptoendolithic colonization [19\u201321, 28\u201329]. The key effect of the sun exposure in shaping the composition and abundance of functional groups of fungi in the Antarctic endolithic communities has been recently proved [19\u201321] as the northern exposed surfaces present considerably more favourable conditions than southern facing rocks [30\u201332] that, being in the shadow, may be too cold to allow biological activity.", "Indeed, the capability to maintain biological activity depends on sufficient insolation on the rock surfaces allowing an efficient photosynthetic process; moreover, temperature became warmer for metabolic activity due the increasing of aw as consequence of melting of snow [33].", "Antarctic cryptoendolithic microorganisms have to face several stresses simultaneously and they need to concurrently develop survival strategies to address external conditions. A conspicuous number of studies have been performed on the adaptation strategies on black fungi isolated from these communities, resulting highly resistant in terms of extremes of temperatures, acidity, osmotic stress and salinity, dehydration and irradiation [34\u201339]; besides, the stress-response mechanisms of whole metacommunity has not yet been investigated.", "In this study, for the first time to our knowledge, metabolomics was successfully applied to Antarctic cryptoendolithic lichen-dominated communities to define adaptation strategies adopted by these communities to survive in these harshest conditions. We found different microbes\u2019 response to sun exposure by modulating specific pathways; in particular, among the candidates to be considered biomarkers, the precursor metabolites of melanin and allantoin pathways were the most affected by sun exposure and we may consider these pathways to be directly involved to response to the environmental pressure."]
