["Introduction", "Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic human pathogen and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from superficial skin and soft tissue infections to severe life-threatening diseases such as endocarditis and pneumonia1,2. The enormous health burden caused by S. aureus is, in part, attributed to its ability to acquire resistance against several classes of antibiotics, making it refractory to many treatment options. Moreover, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) can infect both healthy and immunocompromised populations in the community and hospital setting3\u20135. Due to the emergence of MRSA, drug discovery is critically important for combating S. aureus infections6,7.", "To identify compounds that antagonize S. aureus, several groups have focused on coagulase-negative staphylococcal species (CoNS) as many of these species often colonize the same niches as S. aureus and likely compete for space and nutrients8\u201310. To successfully compete with S. aureus, CoNS have been shown to secrete antimicrobials that directly kill S. aureus10,11. Indeed, strains of S. epidermidis and S. hominis species, among others, have been reported to secrete posttranslationally modified peptides termed bacteriocins that inhibit S. aureus colonization on human skin11. In addition, S. lugdunensis has recently been shown to produce the non-ribosomally synthesized cyclic peptide antibiotic termed lugdunin that directly kills S. aureus10. Moreover, lugdunin can stimulate host production of antimicrobial peptides and recruit immune cells to clear S. aureus infections12. Another strategy used by some CoNS including S. schleiferi and S. caprae is the secretion of autoinducing peptides that specifically block the activation of the agr quorum sensing system in S. aureus. By doing so, these CoNS reduce S. aureus virulence and interfere with colonization of the host9,13,14. Clearly, CoNS have evolved mechanisms to antagonize S. aureus growth and virulence to gain a competitive advantage.", "S. chromogenes is a CoNS that can secrete antimicrobials to antagonize S. aureus and other bacteria8,15\u201317. Here, we show that S. chromogenes ATCC43764 secretes the purine analog 6-thioguanine (6-TG) to impede S. aureus growth. The underlying genetic basis for 6-TG biosynthesis was elucidated in S. chromogenes as a six-gene operon, termed tgs for thioguanine synthesis; the tgs operon was also identified in the genomes of a number of S. capitis, S. pseudintermedius, and S. epidermidis strains. We show that the operon from tgs-positive CoNS strains encodes 6-TG, which is inhibitory to S. aureus. This was shown to be the case in vivo as well, as co-infections of virulent S. aureus USA300 with tgs-positive S. epidermidis or S. aureus RN4220 (a cloning strain) carrying tgs genes on a plasmid demonstrated a significant reduction in skin lesion necrosis. Moreover, 6-TG reduced S. aureus disease severity in a subcutaneous murine infection model, owing to its effect on downregulating toxin production by S. aureus. The therapeutic effects of 6-TG are due to its ability to reduce gene expression of the agr quorum sensing system, ribosomal proteins, and purine biosynthesis. This study identifies a mechanism by which CoNS interfere with growth and virulence of S. aureus."]
