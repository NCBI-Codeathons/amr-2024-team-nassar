["Introduction", "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are key enzymes for protein translation in all cells, catalyzing the formation of an ester bond between a specific amino acid and the 3\u2019-end adenosine of its conjugate tRNA1,2. There are three factors that make aaRSs valuable therapeutic targets. First, the sequence and fine structure differences between pathogenic microbial aaRS and human aaRS are applicable for designing drugs that selectively inhibit the pathogen aaRS3,4. Second, only low levels of aaRSs are required for protein translation under physiological conditions, and cells are able to withstand the down-regulation of aaRSs; therefore, drugs that specifically target hyperproliferative cells, such as cancer cells, may be developed5. Third, some aaRSs have nonclassical functions associated with specific pathologies or cancers, making them potential targets for the development of novel pharmacological approaches6\u20138.", "AaRSs present multiple druggable pockets, including amino acid- and ATP-binding sites, tRNA-binding regions, and other binding sites, such as editing sites and auxiliary hydrophobic pockets9. Competitive binding to these sites with substrate molecules is a common mechanism of action (MoA) for aaRS inhibitors, including single-site10\u201315, dual-site16\u201320, and recently developed triple-site inhibitors21. In addition, inhibitors with novel MoAs, including Trojan horses22,23, induced-fit24, and reaction hijacking inhibitors25 have been reported. These inhibitors are highly valuable for understanding the catalytic mechanism of aaRS and for developing therapeutic drugs that target aaRS.", "The natural product Obafluorin (OB) is a potent inhibitor of bacterial threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS)26. It is produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 39502 through the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly line26\u201332. The NRPS ObiF contains a type I thioesterase (TE) domain with a rarely reported cysteine residue at the catalytic site that plays a critical role in the formation of the OB \u03b2-lactone ring29. OB has broad antibiotic activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens26,27. The catechol moiety of OB was found to be essential for its antibacterial activity33. Our previous work showed that OB covalently binds to ThrRS, forming an ester bond with a tyrosine residue in the catalytic center via the highly strained \u03b2-lactone ring34, making OB the first covalent aaRS inhibitor with demonstrated crystal structures.", "The elucidation of the self-resistance mechanisms of antibiotic-producing microorganisms will help to reveal the MoA of antibiotics, guide the discovery of new natural products, and provide key clues for clinical antibiotic resistance. The resistance of P. fluorescens to OB is related to the expression of ObaO, a second copy of ThrRS26,33. However, why ObaO is resistant to OB remains unknown.", "During the analysis of the reason for the resistance of ObaO to OB, we found that a glycine residue involved in the formation of the active pocket of ThrRS contributes to the latter\u2019s sensitivity to OB. Through five crystal structures, biochemical and biophysical analyses, and computational simulations, we found that mutation of this flexible residue to a more rigid residue, such as a serine or an alanine, did not alter the structure, but significantly improved the thermal stability of the enzyme and suppressed the ability of ThrRS to change conformation. These mutations caused resistance of ThrRS to antibiotics that require conformational changes in ThrRS, including OB and another ThrRS inhibitor, borrelidin (BN). This work provides a deeper understanding of the MoA of OB and emphasizes the importance of backbone kinetics for drug development."]
