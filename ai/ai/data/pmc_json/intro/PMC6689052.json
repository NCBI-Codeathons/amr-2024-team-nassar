["Introduction", "An idealised linear biosynthetic pathway to a complex natural product can be imagined proceeding through a series of intermediate structures which would exist for some finite time as the pathway product accumulates. These hypothetical intermediates would exist freely in solution or bound to enzymes in the case of assembly line processes, and eventually all flux through the pathway would end and only the final product would exist. In reality no pathways proceed in this manner as the situation is complicated by varying rates of reaction for the different steps, meaning that some intermediates accumulate, while the inherent reactivity of other intermediates, or their ability to act as substrates for housekeeping enzymes not dedicated to the pathway, means that shunt metabolites often arise. Matters are further complicated by the fact that pathways are often convergent, with multiple units made in parallel before assembly into the final product, for example in the biosynthetic pathways to macrolide or aminoglycoside1 antibiotics. In addition, some pathways are not linear, and the final product is accessed via several routes due to the inherent substrate plasticity of the biosynthetic enzymes; well-studied examples include the rapamycin and erythromycin pathways2. Thus, in practice, any biosynthetic pathway will lead to the accumulation of a mixture comprising the final product plus varying concentrations of pathway intermediates and shunt metabolites. The composition of such a mixture will vary further when alternate growth conditions are used3. Sometimes the final product of the pathway cannot be clearly discerned.", "Such mixtures of compounds are said to comprise a series of biosynthetic congeners, and their identification can provide valuable information about a biosynthetic pathway and may sometimes lead to new biosynthetic understanding4. We recently reported the formicamycins, aromatic polyketides produced by Streptomyces formicae KY5 isolated from the fungus-growing plant-ant Tetroponera penzigi (Fig.\u00a01)5. In total, sixteen congeners were isolated including three more fasamycins, a group of compounds previously reported from the heterologous expression of a clone derived from environmental DNA6. These congeners are the product of a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) operating in conjunction with post-PKS modifications that include O-methylation and halogenation, plus oxidative and reductive modifications. Intrigued by these compounds, which exhibit potent antibacterial activity, we employed targeted metabolomics to identify further congeners that may have been missed during manual analysis of culture extracts. This led us to identify the formicapyridines (1\u20139), pyridine containing polyketide alkaloids which represent additional products of the formicamycin (for) biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). Products of type II PKS systems which contain a pyridine moiety are rare7.Fig. 1Chemical structures of metabolites isolated from Streptomyces formicae. Compounds 1\u20139 and 13 were discovered during this study whereas 10\u201312 and 14\u201326 were reported in an earlier study5", "Fig. 1Chemical structures of metabolites isolated from Streptomyces formicae.

In contrast, the formicapyridines are minor shunt metabolites that arise due to derailment of the formicamycin biosynthetic pathway. We show here that reprogramming the for BGC, by deleting the forS gene encoding an ABM family protein, leads to significantly increased production of formicapyridines with concomitant reduction of the combined titre of fasamycins and formicamycins. These and other mutational data lead us to the hypothesis that ForS is not a cyclase but forms part of a multienzyme complex where it acts as a chaperone-like protein to aid in maintaining pathway fidelity and performance. The discovery and engineering of formicapyridine biosynthesis raises intriguing questions regarding the evolution of type II PKS biosynthetic pathways and the origins of natural product chemical diversity."]
