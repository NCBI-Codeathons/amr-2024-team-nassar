["Introduction", "Polyynes or polyacetylenes contain a conformationally rigid rod-like architecture and an electron-rich consecutive acetylene moiety. Hundreds of polyynes have been discovered, out of which compounds have mainly been isolated from terrestrial plants and marine organisms1,2. In contrast to polyynes from plant sources, bacterial polyynes contain a distinct terminal alkyne with conjugated systems, which causes bacterial polyynes to be more unstable. This instability has discouraged surveys of bacterial polyynes using a bioactivity-guided isolation approach. Nevertheless, more than ten bacterial polyynes have been recorded in a few species. Notably, most polyynes have been reported to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial effects. For instance, cepacins, isolated from Pseudomonas cepacian SC 11783 (taxonomically reclassified as a Burkholderia diffusa), was reported to have antibacterial activity against the majority Gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococci spp., and anti-oomycetal activity against Pythium ultimum1\u20134. Caryoynencin, isolated from Pseudomonas caryophylli (taxonomically reclassified as Burkholderia caryophylli), was reported to have antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococci aureus, and Bacillus subtilis5. In addition, collimonins isolated from Collimonas fungivorans Ter3316,7 and Sch 31828 isolated from Microbispora sp. SCC14388 were reported to have antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Candida spp., respectively. Other polyynes, such as ergoynes isolated Gynuella sunshinyii and fischerellins from Fischerella muscicola, were found to have potential cytotoxic/ antibacterial and allelopathic ability9\u201311. Recently, protegenins (including protegencin) produced by Pseudomonas protegens were reported to have antifungal, antioomycete, and anti-algae activities12\u201315. Despite the apparent bioactivity of these compounds, the active target and mechanism(s) remain unclear.", "Here, we used a multi-omic approach and genetic engineering to identify the bioactive polyynes of Massilia sp. YMA4, characterized their biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC) named massilin (mas) BGC, and delineated the antifungal mechanism of bacterial polyynes. Furthermore, heterologous co-expression of mas BGC further illustrated the conserved genes critical to the electron-rich consecutive alkyne moiety and an additional gene responsible for structure derivatives modification of the polyynes. Furthermore, a comparative genomic analysis uncovered the self-resistance gene and identified bacterial polyynes as antifungal agents that target the first enzyme of ergosterol biosynthesis, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase. Finally, crystallographic analysis unveiled the detailed binding model of polyynes to the acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase."]
