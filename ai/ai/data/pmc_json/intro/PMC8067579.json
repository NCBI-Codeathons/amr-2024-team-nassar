["1. Introduction", "Phytotoxic secondary metabolites from fungi (or called fungal phytotoxins) are toxic compounds to plants produced by fungi, especially by plant fungal pathogens responsible for serious diseases of agrarian and forest plants causing significant economical losses [1]. Fungal phytotoxins play an important role in the development of plant disease symptoms, inclduing leaf spots, wilting, chlorosis, necrosis, and growth inhibition and promotion [2,3]. Their chemical and biological characterizations as well as the structure\u2013activity relations and modes of action can help us to deeply investigate plant-pathogen interactions.", "Fungal phytotoxins are either host specific (HST) or non-host specific (NHST) toxins. Hosts specific phytotoxins (or called host-selective toxins) are active only towards plants that are hosts of the toxin-producing fungi, and are essential for pathogenicity [4]. Host specific toxins are mainly produced by plant pathogenic fungi of Alternaria, Colletotrichum, and Helminthosporium [5,6]. In some cases, host sensitivity is mediated by gene-for-gene interactions, and phytotoxin sensitivity is mandatory for disease development [7]. Contrarily, non-host specific phytotoxins (or called non-host-selective toxins) are primary determinants of host range and not essential for pathogenicity, although they may contribute to virulence. These phytotoxins have a broader range of activity, causing symptoms not only on hosts of the pathogenic fungi, but also on other plant species [8].", "Many reviews related to the phytotoxins produced by fungi have been previously published. However, some reviews have been published for a few years [1,8,9,10,11]. Some discussed only the biochemical and physiological aspects of phytotoxins [12], and some others only proposed fungal phytotoxins as potential herbicides [11,13]. Additionally, other reviews only reported on the phytotoxins produced by one fungal genus [4,14,15,16], or one fungal species [17]. Some others were reported on the phytotoxins produced by fungi during interactions with one plant species or only one plant group [18]. Furthermore, with the expansion of research scope, more and more fungal phytotoxins with herbicidal potential have been recently revealed from non-phytopathogenic fungi such as plant endophytic fungi [19,20,21], animal endophytic fungi [22,23,24], soil-derived fungi [25,26], and marine-derived fungi [27,28].", "Fungal phytotoxins belong to different classes such as polyketides, phenols and phenolic acids, terpenoids, nitrogen-containing metabolites based on their biosynthetic pathways and structural characters. To our knowledge, there are no detailed reviews about the phytotoxic secondary metabolites from all fungal species to be published. This review describes fungal phytotoxic metabolites, their structures, isolated fungi and phytotoxic activities. Furthermore, the probable roles played by fungal phytotoxins in the induction of plant disease symptoms, structure\u2013activity relationships, phytotoxic mechanisms, as well as the potential applications in agriculture are also discussed."]
