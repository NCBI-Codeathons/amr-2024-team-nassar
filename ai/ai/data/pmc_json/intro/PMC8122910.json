["1. Introduction", "Gut microbiota plays an important role in the host diet, nutrient production and absorption, metabolism, and maintenance of the immune system [1]. A large quantity of evidence has demonstrated that dysbiosis of intestinal bacteria is closely related to several diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular disease and celiac disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus [2,3,4,5]. It is, thereby, a crucial strategy to improve host wellness is the maintenance of gut microbial homeostasis. Prebiotics are effective microbiota-management tool; a prebiotic is described as a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit [6,7]. Inulin, galactooligosaccharides (GOS) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are the most prevalently used commercial prebiotic ingredients worldwide. These prebiotics have exhibited crucial efficiency in counteracting diseases [8,9]. For one, prebiotics can be utilized by beneficial microbiota and support their growth in the intestine [7]. The latter forcefully competes for nutrients and adhesion sites with opportunistic pathogens [10]. In addition, beneficial microorganisms may interact with host cells, which contributes to the intestinal barrier and immune functions [9].", "Furthermore, prebiotics can affect the composition and proportion of gut microbial metabolites, which may be involved in the occurrence and development of several diseases including depression, colorectal cancer, obesity, and type 2 diabetes [11]. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, are an extremely important class of these metabolites. SCFAs play a crucial role in the maintenance of the host\u2013gut homeostasis and health status. The mechanisms underlying SCFAs may be: (a) SCFAs decrease inflammatory responses, modulate the immune system, and induce apoptosis of cancer cells; (b) SCFAs, in turn, regulate gut microbial composition by inhibiting the conditioned-pathogen growth; (c) emerging research shows that SCFAs may promote the gut\u2013brain communication, which thereby affects multiple neurochemical pathways [2]. Another important type of metabolites are secondary bile acids (SBAs) from the conversion of primary bile acids by gut microbiota. An increasing number of studies show that SBAs may exhibit diverse roles in host physiology [12]. In particular, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) have demonstrated to suppress the proliferation of Clostridium difficile, induce hepatocellular carcinogenesis, and regulate metabolic and immune responses [13]. Moreover, DCA and LCA can be further modified into additional SBAs by intestinal microbiota, i.e., hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA). HDCA is suspected to have high cytotoxicity and anaphylactic roles [14,15,16]. Whereas several studies reported that HDCA prevents gallstones and atherosclerosis [17,18].", "Therefore, prebiotics are the necessary nutrients for the maintenance of human health and counteracting diseases. Isomaltulose naturally occurs in honey and sugar cane juice [19]. Due to that, it exhibits many excellent properties, including similar organoleptic quality and processability to sucrose, low glycemic index, and non-cariogenicity; isomaltulose has been extensively used as sugar alternative in the food industry [20]. In our previous study, isomaltulose promoted the proliferation of selected probiotics [21]. Moreover, it affected the production of SCFAs in coculture with specific probiotic strains. Another in vitro human colonic model research demonstrated that isomaltulose reduced the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the level of acetic and butyric acids [22]. Therefore, these in vitro experiments exhibit that isomaltulose may have prebiotic activity. However, there is a substantial difference in intestinal microbial composition between in vitro and in vivo experiments. The present study aimed to explore the modulation effect of isomaltulose on gut microbiota in rats. In addition, we investigated changes in the production of SCFAs and SBAs by dietary isomaltulose. This study may provide a scientific basis of the prebiotic activity of isomaltulose and, thus, contribute toward boosting its industrial application as a prebiotic ingredient."]
