["1. Introduction", "Lignocellulosic residues represent a globally abundant renewable resource with great potential to replace fossil-based processes for the production of value-added chemicals and fuels. The fast pyrolysis of wheat straw as performed in the bioliq\u00ae plant at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) [1] may provide such an alternative to conventional fuel production. However, the pyrolytic aqueous condensate (PAC) formed during this process is hardly suitable for an energetic use due to its comparatively low heating value [2], and therefore currently accumulates as an unexploited side stream.", "The organic carbons contained in the condensate render it a promising substrate for microbial fermentation with Aspergillus oryzae, as this filamentous fungus is capable of metabolizing the two major PAC components, acetate and acetol (Table A1, see Appendix A) [3,4]. A. oryzae is widely used in the traditional fermentative production of foods and beverages like soy sauce, miso paste and sake, but it also shows great potential for the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes [5,6,7] and organic acids [3,8,9]. The fungus is very robust to various environmental conditions, which is also reflected in its increased tolerance to liquid pyrolysis products compared to several other fungal species [10]. However, growth-inhibiting substances contained in the condensate, such as cyclic ketones, furans and phenols [10], prevent fungal growth on PAC concentrations above 1.25% [11]. The removal of these inhibitors is a common strategy to increase the PAC tolerance of the fungus [11], but since any treatment of the condensate involves additional laboratory effort and cost, the generation of more resistant production strains seems to be the preferable solution. This can either be accomplished by a rather time-consuming strain adaptation [12,13], undirected mutagenesis [14] or targeted genetic engineering [15,16]. Identifying potential targets for strain engineering requires comprehensive knowledge about the metabolic dynamics of the organism that is to be optimized. Transcriptome analysis is an appropriate tool for this purpose, as it provides insights into the regulation of metabolic gene expression. However, for Aspergillus species, most of the existing transcriptome studies related to lignocellulose focus on the identification of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) [17,18,19,20] rather than the inhibitory effect of lignocellulose-degradation products.", "This study therefore aims to provide insight into the transcriptional response of A. oryzae to cultivation in media containing PAC as the sole carbon source (C-source). Gene expression was compared with both pure acetate and glucose, the current standard substrate for most microbial fermentations. To allow the utilization of PAC as the sole C-source, pretreatment with a combination of overliming, rotary evaporation and activated carbon was required. By identifying potential targets for an improvement of fungal PAC tolerance, this study provides the basis for a potential reduction in pretreatment effort in the future."]
