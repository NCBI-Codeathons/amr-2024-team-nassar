["1. Introduction", "Cancer is still the second leading cause of death globally, and its death toll exceeds the combined deaths from human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and malaria [1,2,3,4]. In 2020, GLOBOCAN estimated that 19.3 million new cancer cases and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths occurred worldwide [5,6]. Cancer includes a series of diseases caused by the uncontrolled growth of malignant cells, which may invade or spread to other parts of the body [7,8]. Thus far, many strategies have been developed for cancer treatment, including surgery [9,10], radiation therapy [11,12,13], chemotherapy [14,15,16,17], targeted therapy [18,19,20], hormonal therapy [21,22], and immunotherapy [23,24], or a combination of these options [25,26]. As a result of all these treatments, the incidence of cancer has declined slightly over the past decade.", "However, traditional therapies are only effective for some early malignant tumors [27,28,29], and the main reasons for eventual failure of tumor treatment are metastasis [30], recurrence [31], heterogeneity [32], chemotherapy resistance [33], and avoidance of immune surveillance [34]. Chemotherapy is mainly achieved by using chemotherapeutic drugs to kill cancer cells [35,36]. As a means of systemic treatment, the drug often circulates throughout most of the organs and tissues of the body with the blood, which can cause damage to other healthy tissues and organs [37,38]. However, chemotherapy has a reliable effect on some tumors that tend to spread throughout the body and on metastatic tumors [39,40,41]. The classic chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin (Dox) [42], vemurafenib [43], and paclitaxel (PTX) [44]) are still the mainstay of current treatment, but they are limited by narrow treatment indicators, significant toxicity, and frequent acquired drug resistance. Traditional chemotherapy interferes with DNA synthesis and mitosis, leading to the death of fast-growing and dividing cancer cells [16,45,46]; however, these drugs are non-selective and can damage healthy normal tissues, causing serious complications and undesirable side effects, such as loss of appetite and nausea. In fact, the severe adverse effects of chemotherapy drugs on healthy tissues and organs are the main reason for the high mortality of cancer patients.", "Further research into the pathogenesis of cancer has led to new treatment options, including targeted therapy [47,48] and immunotherapy [49,50]. Targeted chemotherapy mainly uses molecular targeted drugs to block specific molecules and metabolic pathways in tumor cell growth and proliferation. Compared to other types of cancer treatments, targeted therapy can achieve the greatest therapeutic effect and lowest toxicity. In particular, the more targeted the drug, the lower the possibility of drug resistance. The clinical success of immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of a variety of advanced malignant tumors [51,52]. However, most patients do not benefit from existing immunotherapies, and many patients experience immune-related adverse events [53]. It is generally believed that the development of new anticancer drugs has greatly improved the survival and quality of life of cancer patients. However, in many cases, these drugs show a good response during initial treatment, but later on in the treatment, the efficacy of the drugs decreases and can lead to cancer recurrence. This phenomenon is called acquired drug resistance and is a major problem in the treatment of cancer [54,55,56]. The formation of drug resistance is mainly due to a kind of internal resistance that develops within tumor cells [57,58,59]. A specific cell membrane transporter changes the drug transport and pumps the drug out of tumor cells [60]. In addition, the gradual acquisition of specific heredity and epigenetics in cancer cells during the treatment process greatly contributes to acquired drug resistance [54]. Drug resistance is defined as a decline in the efficacy and potency of a drug in order to limit treatment, ultimately leading to failure in the treatment of the disease [61]. Tumors such as kidney cancer [62], hepatocellular carcinoma [63], and malignant melanoma [64] often respond well to chemotherapy in the early stage, but become unresponsive in later stages of treatment due to the development of acquired drug resistance.", "In order to solve these problems, we urgently need to develop new treatment methods to help improve clinical efficacy. The emergence of nanotechnology has had a profound impact on the clinical treatment of tumors, which has promoted the rapid development of targeted therapy [64,65,66], combined drug therapy [67,68], and early tumor diagnosis [69]. Among them, NDDSs have become a research hotspot at the interface between nanotechnology and biomedicine, because of their efficient loading, targeted delivery, controlled release, and other functions for drugs, and show promise in biomedical applications [70,71]. For example, silicon-based nanomaterials [72], polymers [73], liposomes, and metal NPs [74] are designed to deliver anticancer drugs to tumor tissues. In various NDDSs, polymer-functionalized nanomaterials have attracted widespread attention as excellent candidate materials for therapeutic drug delivery, especially based on their multivalent binding ability and ideal biocompatibility [75,76]. In this paper, we discuss various types of polymer NPs and focus on their applications in traditional chemotherapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, and combination therapy."]
