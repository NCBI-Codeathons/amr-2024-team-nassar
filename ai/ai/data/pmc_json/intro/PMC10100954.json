["INTRODUCTION", "Actinobacteria, as the most abundant producers of secondary metabolites, produce a variety of complex polyketides with broad-spectrum biological activities (1). Among them, polyether ionophores are a unique class of type I polyketides featuring distinctive tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran rings and are produced exclusively by actinobacteria. These polyketides have been successfully used in veterinary medicine and animal husbandry for more than half a century. Furthermore, they also display promising biological properties, including antiviral, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities (2). The intriguing activities of ionophore agents can be attributed to their ability to chelate metal cations to form lipid-soluble complexes. These complexes facilitate cation transport across plasma membranes, resulting in membrane depolarization and subsequent cell damage or death (2, 3). Lasalocid (4), one of the seven currently marketed carboxylic polyether ionophores, has been validated as a classical anticoccidial drug for poultry and a growth promoter in ruminants (5, 6). Lasalocid selectively inhibits intracellular sporozoites while remaining relatively noninjurious to the host cell, and it has biased antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, whereas most Gram-negative strains are still refractory (7). Recently, this ionophore has been verified as a novel inhibitor that protects cells from multiple deadly bacterial toxins via corrupting vesicular trafficking and Golgi stack homeostasis (8). Moreover, lasalocid and its synthetic analogs have shown high antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines and, simultaneously, lower cytotoxicity toward nontumor cells than cisplatin, which hints at their potential to be developed as candidates for cancer treatment (2, 3, 9, 10).", "Given the broad-spectrum bioactivities and promising applications of polyether ionophores, increasing numbers of studies have been performed on the regulation of their biosynthesis. The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of nigericin (nig) and salinomycin (sln) both contain a single pathway-specific regulatory gene, and the overexpression of these genes greatly enhanced the production of the corresponding polyether ionophores (11, 12). Unlike nig and sln, the BGCs of monensin (mon) and nanchangmycin (nan) each contain multiple regulatory genes that encode regulators belonging to diverse families, including LAL (large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family), SARP (Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins), TetR, and AraC. These regulators form complex coregulatory cascades governing the biosynthesis of monensin and nanchangmycin (13, 14). In addition to the above-mentioned cluster-situated regulators (CSRs), the global transcriptional regulator DasR has also been proven to increase monensin production in Streptomyces cinnamonensis (15). However, although the biosynthetic pathway for lasalocid has been well elucidated (16), the regulatory mechanism in lasalocid production remains obscure, which hinders its titer improvement and further industrialization. Meanwhile, comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses have revealed that even BGCs encoding the same molecule may vary in both gene content and organization (17\u201319). These homologous BGCs normally keep conserved biosynthetic genes and relatively variable regulatory genes, the latter of which promote BGC diversification and can serve as evolutionary evidence (20, 21). Several BGCs for polyether ionophores have been identified, while little is known about their regulatory diversification. Comparative dissection of their regulation systems may provide valuable insights into the evolution of these BGCs.", "To date, lasalocid BGCs have been cloned from two closely related strains of Streptomyces lasalocidi, ATCC 31180T (las) and ATCC 35851 (lsd) (22, 23), and were recently discovered from a potential novel species represented by red soil-derived Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (lod) (24\u201326). Here, to elucidate the pathway-specific regulatory mechanism in lasalocid biosynthesis, we conducted comparative and parallel functional analyses of the regulatory genes from different lasalocid BGCs. Compared to las and lsd, the lod cluster contains an exclusive regulatory gene, lodR1, in addition to the conserved lodR2 and lodR3 genes that are universal in the reported lasalocid BGCs. We reveal that both the variable and conserved regulatory genes are functional in different lasalocid BGCs, providing evidence for regulatory diversification. We also identified a conserved repressor-activator system composed of LodR2/Las3/Lsd6\u20137 (unless otherwise specified, the dash indicates a range) and LodE/Las2/Lsd5, which is important for the control of lasalocid concentrations at appropriate levels in the producers."]
