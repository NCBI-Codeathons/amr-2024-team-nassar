["1. Introduction", "Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats to modern healthcare, and the development of new drugs to treat drug-resistant infections is vital. The majority of antimicrobials currently used in the clinic are derived from the natural products of soil-dwelling actinomycetes, particularly Streptomyces bacteria [1]. These natural products are made as part of the normal secondary metabolism of these bacteria and are, therefore, also referred to as secondary metabolites. Streptomyces species have been studied as a source of natural product antimicrobials since the \u2018golden age\u2019 of antibiotic discovery, with the first treatment for tuberculosis (TB), streptomycin, described from Streptomyces griseus in 1943 [2]. The increased availability of genome sequencing data in recent years has revealed that the majority of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) coding for natural products in these actinomycete bacteria are not expressed under standard laboratory conditions and, therefore, there is a vast amount of chemical diversity that remains to be explored [3]. These silent or cryptic BGCs are more likely to be a source of compounds with novel structures and novel mechanisms of action and are thought to hold promise as treatments against drug-resistant infections [4]. Streptomyces species and other antibiotic-producing actinomycetes have a complex and multicellular developmental life cycle that is tightly controlled by an intricate regulatory network, much of which remains largely uncharacterised. Moreover, it is well documented that the control of growth and development in Streptomyces species is strongly coupled to the regulation of secondary metabolite production [5,6]. By understanding the complex regulatory networks that control the expression of secondary metabolite BGCs, the potentially novel chemistry encoded could be accessed for clinical development [7].", "Secondary metabolite production begins with the transcription of the biosynthetic genes [8]. During transcription, the RNA polymerase (RNAP) transcribes the DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA), which can then be translated into the functional protein by the ribosome [9]. To initiate transcription of the biosynthetic genes, the RNAP must, therefore, recognise the promoter sequences within a BGC. This process can be enhanced or repressed by transcriptional regulator proteins. On binding of a transcriptional activator or the release of a transcriptional repressor, the RNAP is able to recognise the promoter and begin the process of transcription. Most secondary metabolite BGCs contain all the genes required for the synthesis of the compounds in one or more neighbouring operons. In addition, genes coding for host-resistance and one or more regulators are often also contained within the BGC [5]. Regulator(s) encoded within the BGC are known as cluster situated regulators (CSRs) and usually control the expression of the biosynthetic genes within the same BGC. However, the expression of a BGC might also be under the control of one or more global regulatory systems that sense environmental signals and link secondary metabolism with the primary metabolism and other aspects of fundamental growth and development [3,7]. Furthermore, cross-cluster regulation, where a CSR from one cluster is involved in the regulation of another BGC elsewhere in the genome, can also occur and is likely to be more widespread than current reports suggest.", "1.1. Cluster Situated Regulators (CSRs) Control the Expression of Biosynthetic Genes within their Pathways", "One of the largest families of CSRs is the Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family. SARP homologs are encoded by many BGCs, including type I and type II polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS), \u00df-lactam and lantibiotic gene clusters [7]. These regulators are characterised by an N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif responsible for DNA binding [5]. SARPs usually activate the expression of biosynthesis genes by binding to heptameric repeat sequences in the promoter regions of the genes they regulate [7]. Some of the most well characterised secondary metabolite BGCs are those found in the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor [10]. The BGCs coding for the antibiotics actinorhodin, undecylprodigiosin and the calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA) in S. coelicolor all contain SARP family regulators that activate the transcription of the biosynthetic genes within the cluster; ActII-orf4, RedD and CdaR, respectively [11]. In addition to the SARPs, the second major class of positive CSRs are the large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family (LAL) proteins. While SARPs are found specifically in actinomycete genomes, genes coding for LAL homologues have been found in other phyla, including the Gram-negative proteobacteria [7]. LAL regulators usually contain an N-terminal nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) binding motif in addition to a C-terminal HTH motif. A well-characterised example is the LAL regulator PikD, which is the primary activator of the macrolide biosynthesis genes in the multi-drug encoding polyketide synthase (PKS) BGC in Streptomyces venezuelae, which encodes for the biosynthesis of methymycin, neomethymycin, narbomycin and pikromycin [12]. Similarly, rapH encodes a LAL regulator in Streptomyces hygroscopicus that plays a role in the activation of the biosynthesis of rapamycin, a macrocyclic polyketide with a broad range of bioactivities [13].", "Many CSRs have ligand binding capabilities in addition to binding DNA, and they alter gene expression levels within a BGC in response to the presence of cellular metabolites. For example, TetR-family regulators are a major class of repressor involved in adaptive responses that typically contain a 47 amino acid long HTH DNA binding motif and a ligand binding domain on the same polypeptide [3,14]. The binding of the ligand, often one or more products of the biosynthesis pathway, induces a conformational change that inhibits the interaction with DNA [7]. In this way, TetR regulators can alter the transcription of genes in the BGC in response to specific signals and are sometimes referred to as one component systems. Well-characterised examples of TetR regulators include the JadR and JadR2 regulators of jadomycin biosynthesis (discussed in more detail below) [11]. Cluster situated TetR-family regulators often regulate the expression of the self-resistance mechanism, for example, by controlling the expression of efflux pumps, as well as autoregulating their own expression [14]. Many other regulator protein families, such as the LacI- and MerR-family regulators, also function as one component systems, with one domain responsible for DNA binding and another either binding a ligand or sensing a stressor, to allow these CSRs to respond to stimuli, such as oxidative stress, heavy metals or antibiotics [15]. In contrast, MarR-family transcriptional regulators bind DNA and their ligands using the same domain. They are found throughout bacteria and are named after the multiple antibiotic resistance regulator in Escherichia coli. MarR proteins function as homodimers where each monomer contributes a winged HTH DNA binding motif, and they usually repress transcription of their target genes, often by binding to palindromic repeat sequences in the DNA. Like other ligand-responsive transcriptional repressors, the binding of a ligand blocks the protein-DNA interaction and induces gene expression. MarR regulators often control the expression of host-resistance mechanisms and efflux pumps, and the ligand is usually a product of the biosynthetic pathway they control [16]. An example is the MarR family transcriptional regulator SAV4189, encoded within the avermectin BGC in Streptomyces avermitilis, which represses its own transcription and an adjacent, co-transcribed gene coding for an efflux pump, which is presumably involved in removing avermectin from the cell. SAV4189 has also been shown to indirectly activate avermectin production through interactions with another CSR, AveR [17].", "1.2. Antibiotic Biosynthesis is Controlled by Both High- and Low-Level Regulatory Systems", "CSRs are traditionally considered to be at the bottom of the regulatory cascade and involved in the specific regulation of a single BGC, but some have been shown to cause pleiotropic changes in gene expression across the genome of antibiotic-producing microorganisms. For example, ActII-orf4, the SARP-family CSR of the actinorhodin BGC in S. coelicolor, has been shown to influence the transcription of genes in multiple other BGCs across the genome of S. coelicolor. Constitutive overexpression of actII-orf4 causes changes to the levels of cda transcripts and decreases the expression of genes in the undecylprodigiosin (red) BGC [18]. Furthermore, the CSRs ActII-orf4 and RedZ, another CSR in the red BGC, have been shown to alter transcription levels of genes from the whiE spore pigment BGC and the NRPS BGC coding for coelichelin siderophore biosynthesis, as well as genes involved in antioxidant production in S. coelicolor. This illustrates that the regulation of secondary metabolism by these \u2018low-level\u2019 regulatory proteins is more complex than previously thought [18,19]. Although mostly coordinated by global regulators, some CSRs are able to respond to extracellular signals or metabolites that are produced by other biosynthetic pathways within the cell. For example, LysR-family transcriptional regulators consist of a highly conserved N-terminal HTH motif for DNA binding and a more variable C-terminal region for co-factor binding. They are highly conserved among bacteria and are usually CSRs, but some can also act as global transcriptional regulators, and they have been implicated in diverse functions, including the regulation of metabolism, cell division and oxidative stress [20]. An example is the ClaR regulator of the clavulanic acid biosynthesis pathway in Streptomyces clavuligerus. Deletion of claR results in changes to transcription of genes from the clavulanic acid BGC, as well as changes to the transcription of genes within the disparately located cephamycin C and holomycin BGCs. Deletion of claR also affects the transcription of higher-level regulator genes in the genome that are not related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis, such as those involved in the formation of aerial mycelium and control of oxidative stress, causing global changes to transcription [21].", "Many global regulators have also been shown to play an important role in the control of secondary metabolite production, either directly or indirectly through the regulation of CSR activities. The Bld regulators control developmental processes, such as the generation of aerial hyphae, but some members of this family also regulate secondary metabolite biosynthesis [5]. BldD is well-known for its role in controlling entry into sporulation by forming a complex with cyclic di-GMP. BldD also indirectly affects antibiotic biosynthesis by interacting with BldC, which is a small DNA-binding protein belonging to the MerR family of transcriptional activators, that is involved in regulating the expression of genes from both the actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin BGCs, as well as also controlling morphological differentiation, specifically the development of aerial mycelium [22]. Furthermore, BldD has also been shown to bind promoters within some BGCs like the erythromycin cluster in Streptomyces erythraea to directly control the expression of biosynthetic genes [23,24,25]. The GntR-family is another group of global regulators that consist of a typical N-terminal HTH DNA binding domain and a C-terminal effector-binding and oligomerisation domain [26]. Members of this family, such as DasR, have been shown to control the expression of genes involved in both morphogenesis and antibiotic production in response to environmental signals and the availability of nutrients [27]. DasR alters the levels of secondary metabolite gene expression and antibiotic production in response to the levels of N-acetylglucosamine in the environment [28]. In S. coelicolor, DasR indirectly controls the production of both actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin by repressing the transcription of the CSRs ActII-orf4 and RedZ. Similarly, in Saccharopolyspora erythraea, the industrial producer of erythromycin A, deletion of dasR has been shown to decrease erythromycin production. However, the erythromycin A BGC does not encode a CSR; therefore, DasR must regulate erythromycin production via a different mechanism, possibly by directly binding promoter regions within the cluster [29]. AraC-family transcriptional regulators also have two domains; an N-terminal dimerisation and ligand binding domain and a highly conserved DNA binding C-terminal HTH domain. They are involved in the control of carbon source utilisation, morphological differentiation, secondary metabolism, pathogenesis and stress responses [30]. A good example is AdpA, a transcriptional regulator in Streptomyces griseus, that activates the transcription of genes involved in morphological development and secondary metabolism in response to the microbial hormone known as A-factor [31]. Another example is SAV742 in S. avermitilis, which controls avermectin biosynthesis, cell growth and morphological differentiation [30].", "While one component systems contain ligand and DNA binding domains within a single protein, two-component systems (TCS) use separate sensor and regulator proteins to perceive and respond to environmental signals. A typical TCS consists of a transmembrane sensor histidine kinase and an associated cytoplasmic response regulator, with the kinase responsible for sensing the signal, undergoing autophosphorylation and then transferring that phosphate to its cognate response regulator. The majority of response regulators belong to the OmpR/PhoB subfamily and consist of a conserved \u03b1/\u03b2 receiver domain and a C-terminal effector domain for DNA binding. Antibiotic-producing bacteria, such as Streptomyces species, generally encode for large numbers of TCS to allow them to control secondary metabolism and many other fundamental aspects of their life cycle in response to extracellular signals, such as nutrient deprivation and microbial competition [32]. Some BGCs encode cluster-situated TCSs, which, although not well characterised, are likely responsible for the control of expression of biosynthetic genes within the same BGC. An example is the CinKR TCS encoded in the cinnamycin BGC in Streptomyces cinnamoneus DSM 40646, which increases the expression of genes within the cinnamycin BGC to increase compound production once the host-resistance mechanism is induced to prevent the deleterious accumulation of the antibiotic [33]. Other TCS, like MtrAB, are involved in the global regulation of secondary metabolite production and coordinating this with growth and development [34,35]. Streptomyces TCSs are reviewed in detail elsewhere [36].", "Thus, most BGCs encode one or more CSRs, but secondary metabolism is also under the control of higher regulatory systems, including one component systems like Crp and DasR and TCS like MtrAB. These examples begin to illustrate the complexity of regulatory systems that control bacterial secondary metabolism. Another level of complexity comes from CSRs like ActII-orf4, which appear to cross-regulate other BGCs elsewhere in the genome (Figure 1). These systems can control the levels of production of two or more secondary metabolites (Table 1)."]
