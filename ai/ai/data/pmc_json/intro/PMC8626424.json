["Introduction", "Bacteria, fungi, and plants often produce toxic secondary metabolites as defense mechanisms against invading organisms. Streptomycetes produce a staggering number and variety of natural products, including genotoxic DNA-damaging antibiotics1. These agents may covalently alkylate or non-covalently intercalate the DNA nucleobases, forming mutagenic and/or toxic adducts that inhibit replication, transcription, or chromosome maturation, leading to chromosome rearrangement and instability, cell death, aging, and disease2\u20137. Among the most potent genotoxic secondary metabolites are those of the spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone (SCPCHD) family, which includes yatakemycin (YTM), gilvusmycin, CC-1065, and duocarmycin A and SA (DSA) (Fig.\u00a01a)\u2014all of which exhibit high cytotoxicity against tumor cells and pathogenic fungi8\u201316. These molecules bind in the minor groove of AT-rich regions of DNA and undergo binding-induced activation to modify N3 of adenine17 (Fig.\u00a01b). Despite forming a covalent link with only one strand of DNA, SCPCHD adducts create an extended network of non-covalent CH-\u03c0 interactions with both strands that greatly stabilizes the DNA duplex and inhibits nucleic acid metabolism18,19.Fig. 1DNA modification by the spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone (SCPCHD) family of natural products.a Chemical structures of yatakemycin (YTM), duocarmycin SA (DSA), and CC-1065.

In addition to toxin inactivation and efflux, DNA repair of the toxin-DNA adduct has been identified as a self-resistance mechanism against genotoxic natural products14,23\u201332. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways serve to eliminate the majority of alkyl-DNA lesions. The NER pathway removes bulky, DNA distorting/destabilizing lesions, and is initiated by an excinuclease complex that isolates the damaged segment of DNA via dual incisions flanking the lesion33,34. By contrast, the BER pathway removes small nucleobase adducts, and is initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases that hydrolyze the N-glycosidic bond to liberate the aberrant nucleobase from the DNA backbone35,36. The resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site is incised by an AP endonuclease, generating a terminal 3\u2032-hydroxyl group needed for polymerase-dependent synthesis of new DNA.", "Owing to their exquisite helix-stabilizing properties, SCPCHD adducts are poorly repaired by the NER pathway, making these compounds highly toxic with strong antibiotic and antitumor potential37\u201340. To counter this toxicity, at least two of the Streptomycetes that produce SCPCHD natural products encode DNA glycosylases within the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters26,29 (Fig.\u00a01c). One of these homologs, YtkR2, has been shown to excise YTM-adenine (YTM-Ade) adducts in vitro and to confer self-resistance against YTM in vivo26 (Fig.\u00a01b). The other homolog, C10R5, has not been characterized, but seems likely to provide similar self-resistance against CC-106529. YtkR2 and C10R5 are homologs of Bacillus cereus AlkD, a unique DNA glycosylase able to excise bulky lesions by virtue of not using the base-flipping mechanism employed by other glycosylases41\u201345. Unlike YtkR2 and CC-1065, AlkD is present in non-antibiotic-producing species of Bacillus and provides only limited cellular resistance against YTM18.", "Although YtkR2 has been shown to provide resistance against YTM, the corresponding resistance provided by C10R5 against CC-1065 is unknown. Moreover, the utility of the non-base-flipping mechanism employed by these enzymes to recognize SCPCHD adducts has not been explored outside YTM and AlkD. To elucidate how YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to efficiently eliminate lesions generated by diverse SCPCHD natural products, we performed a comparative biochemical, biophysical, and structural analysis to identify differences between AlkD and these specialized homologs that are responsible for conferring enhanced cellular resistance against YTM, CC-1065, and DSA. Our data indicate that reduced product affinity, not enhanced substrate recognition, is the key factor associated with improved cellular resistance."]
