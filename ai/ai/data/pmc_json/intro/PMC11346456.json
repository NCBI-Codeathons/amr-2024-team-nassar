["Introduction", "Antibacterial drugs form the backbone of modern medicine by not only curing infections but also supporting essential interventions including organ transplantation and cancer treatment. Alarmingly, in 2019, an estimated 4.95 million deaths worldwide were associated with antimicrobial resistance [1,2]. Compounding this issue, the half-life of an antibacterial agent in the clinic before detection of resistance is \u223c15 years (Figure 1A,B), requiring constant discovery to sustain an inventory of clinically useful antibacterial drugs which circumvent prevalent resistance mechanisms. In the last 30 years, the rate of discovery of these drugs has fallen behind the emergence of new resistance, such that there is now resistance to every clinically approved antibiotic (Figure 1C). As a result, antibacterial drugs are a perishable common good requiring a strategy for sustainable discovery.", "Figure\u00a01.The rate of antibacterial drug discovery has reached a plateau, while the rate of emergence of new resistance is constant.(A) The time between discovery and resistance detection compared with the discovery year for classes of antibacterial drugs.

[3].", "The present torpor emerges from peculiarities of the history and practice of antibacterial drug discovery. First, the failure of target-based discovery [4,5] has made the target-agnostic phenotypic approaches necessary, resulting in increasing re-discovery of easily drugged targets. Second, a focus on natural products has led to an underdeveloped antibacterial therapeutics science which would otherwise guide the discovery and development of new synthetic antibacterial drugs.", "Examining the early history of antibacterial drugs reveals unexplored paths to renewed discovery which might guide the application of the powerful genome-scale genetic and chemical tools now at our disposal. In an early example of integrative chemical biology, in 1882, the dye methylene blue revealed to Robert Koch the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the cause of tuberculosis, inspiring the development of his eponymous postulates. This fundamental biological discovery using chemistry inspired potential cures: contemporaneously with Koch, Paul Ehrlich's selective staining of specific mammalian cells, such as mast cells, led to concept of the magic bullet, a chemical which partitions into disease-causing cells and harms them, leaving host or normal cells intact. Soon after, trypan red (named for its activity against trypanosomes) was discovered as the first antimicrobial magic bullet in 1904. In 1909, Ehrlich himself identified, with the assistance of Sahachiro Hata, the first commercial antibacterial agent, arsphenamine, as a cure for syphilis. Inspired by this progress, dye companies pursued systematic derivatisation and screening of their inventories and reaction side-products against microbes [6,7]. This effort led to the first wave of discovery of effective antibacterial drugs starting with the prodrug, prontosil by Gerhard Domagk in 1932 and its active metabolite, sulfanilamide, in 1935.", "The second wave of antibacterial drug discovery followed the isolation of penicillin from the Penicillium chrysogenum fungus in 1940 [8],demonstrating for the first time that natural products could be harnessed not only as narcotics (such as opium and digitoxin) but also as life-saving medicines. This conceptual revolution provided benefits beyond curing infectious disease, including cancer treatment (anthracyclines, etoposide, vinca alkaloids) and prevention of organ transplant rejection (rapamycin, cyclosporin). For most bacterial infections, natural product screening and development of semi-synthetic analogues overtook synthetic chemistry approaches in a golden era of antibiotic discovery during the mid-20th century [7,9,10]. Now, 69% of antibacterial drugs are natural products derived from soil microbes, in contrast with the entire pharmacopoeia which comprises 38% natural products [11].", "Notable exceptions are the antituberculosis drugs, most of which are synthetics from early screening of dye manufacturing by-products, despite the first effective tuberculosis chemotherapy being streptomycin, a natural product derived from the bacterium Streptomyces griseus. Streptomycin, discovered by Albert Schatz, Elizabeth Bugie, and Selman Waksman in 1944, caused a high incidence of allergies and relatively fast resistance acquisition by M. tuberculosis (factors which led the death of the author George Orwell in 1950). Therefore, it was eventually combined with synthetic para-aminosalicylic acid as the standard of care following a landmark clinical trial in 1950 [12]. Since then, streptomycin is no longer routinely used, with rifampicin the only natural product among first-line antituberculosis drugs.", "The post-genomic age of the late 20th century promised a third wave of antibacterial drug discovery. It was thought that molecular biology, which provided the ability to identify new targets unique to pathogens, would yield numerous magic bullets through rational design [13]. However, high-throughput biochemical screening against known or novel targets in vitro over the last two decades have resulted in no clinical antibacterial candidates, with retrospective analyses noting an apparent bias towards tight-binding compounds with high lipophilicity, and subsequent difficulties in developing whole-cell activity [4,14]. This failure of target-based screening taught the harsh lesson that a drug is more than an avid binder of a validated target.", "As a result, target-agnostic phenotypic screening for antibacterial candidates has returned to prominence along with an appreciation for natural products. However, discovery is stymied by the coupon collector problem, where drawing from the same pool of natural products at first yields a rapid increase in new discoveries \u2014 the golden age \u2014 followed by repeated re-discovery (Figure 1C). This phenomenon became so acute that by 1958 commercial natural product mining efforts invested in dereplication platforms to weed out rediscoveries early in their pipeline [15], but now with the most prevalent agents already discovered, to yield one new antibacterial natural product requires screening around 107 new bacterial species [16].", "Therefore, instead of a third wave of antibacterial drug discovery, there is now a discovery bottleneck (Figure 1C). Since the staining of M. tuberculosis with methylene blue, our understanding of bacterial biology and infection processes has increased dramatically, but in the last 10 years, all 19 approved new antibacterial drugs belonged to existing classes, except for antituberculosis drugs pretomanid (2019) and delamanid (2014) [17\u201320]. Of seven antibiotics in new drug application or Phase III clinical trials at the end of 2022, only gepotidacin (for urinary tract infections and gonorrhoea) and zoliflodacin (for gonorrhoea) are novel pharmacophores and only epetraborole (for Mycobacterium avium infection) has a new mechanism of action. None are found in nature, indicating the potential of synthetics to furnish new drugs with new mechanisms of action.", "The proportion of synthetic compounds (from 44% to 61%) and of novel pharmacophores or mechanisms of action (28% to 65%) has increased in all phases of clinical trials from 2011 to 2022, indicating a promising shift away from me-too drugs and natural products to which resistance likely already exists in the environment [17,21]. However, unlike natural products which are selected and enriched by billions of years of microbial antagonism [22], the vast synthetic chemical space requires artificial curation, which can be assisted by integrated chemical and molecular genetic approaches to discover new compounds active against pathogenic bacteria.", "Integrating chemistry with genetics for renewed discovery", "The conventional role of molecular genetics in drug discovery has been to implicate gene products in disease, thus prioritising them for target-based compound screening. However, unlike many drugs such as ivacaftor (restoring CFTR activity) for cystic fibrosis, imatinib (inhibiting tyrosine kinase) for leukaemia, and saquinavir (protease inhibitor) for HIV, the targets of antibacterial drugs were rarely known before clinical use. Indeed, the mechanism is still debated in several cases, including, for example, pyrazinamide for tuberculosis [23,24]. This ignorance does not preclude clinical value, but rather indicates complex, multi-target activities which drive efficacy and raise the barrier to resistance. As a result, most approved antibacterial drugs were empirically identified as killing a pathogen or curing a host [5], with target-based efforts to discover new antibacterial drugs almost universally failing [4].", "Instead of simply prioritising individual gene product targets for compound screening, target-agnostic phenotypic approaches yield empirically effective candidates without prejudice towards any particular target. As chemical matter discovered this way progresses through the pre-clinical pipeline, it is advantageous to elucidate mechanisms of action and resultant implications for resistance and drug combinations. Molecular genetics can address this need, and help fill remaining knowledge gaps in the field of antibacterial drug discovery (Figure 2A). For example, the emerging discipline of chemical genomics might enable efficient target dereplication to prioritise chemical matter which could circumvent prevalent resistance mechanisms. Using genetics to build better understanding of how cells modify or exclude chemical compounds would enable prioritisation or design of compounds which are not easily inactivated or excluded. Additionally, once the target of an antibacterial candidate discovered using target-agnostic methods is known, the network of gene\u2013gene interactions would indicate productive combination regimens that increase efficacy and lower the incidence of resistance (Figure 2B).", "Figure\u00a02.Biological approaches integrated with chemical understanding are essential for antibacterial drug discovery.(A) Putative targets of hit compounds can be prioritised using genetic approaches (left panel) to assess their likely efficacy and propensity for resistance. The fate and efficacy of bioactive compounds is not only determined by target, but also by chemical properties which influence uptake, mechanism of action, and, again, propensity for resistance. (B) The folate biosynthesis pathway is an exemplar of multiple mechanisms of action including competitive inhibition (trimethoprim) and substrate wasting (PAS), as well as how knowledge of biological networks can explain synergy (trimethoprim and sulfonamides) and resistance liabilities (TYMS loss of function renders DHFR non-essential). Atoms conserved in downstream metabolites are indicated in colours. DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DHF, dihydrofolate; DHPS, dihydropteroate synthase; PAS, para-aminosalicylic acid; THF, tetrahydrofolate; TYMS, thymidylate synthase.", "Biological approaches integrated with chemical understanding are essential for antibacterial drug discovery.", "(A) Putative targets of hit compounds can be prioritised using genetic approaches (left panel) to assess their likely efficacy and propensity for resistance.

Similarly, new drugs will not enter the clinic without antibacterial medicinal chemistry for permeability, low toxicity, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties (Figure 2A). Therefore, the next phase of antibacterial drug discovery will be enabled by integrating this chemical expertise with systematic dissection of bacterial infection biology."]
