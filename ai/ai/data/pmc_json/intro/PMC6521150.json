["1. Introduction", "Actinomycins are a group of chromopeptide lactone antibiotics. To date, 42 actinomycins have been isolated and identified from many species of Streptomyces (Supporting Information (SI), Table S1), including actinomycin D, N-demethylactinomycins, actinomycin C, actinomycin F, actinomycin Z, actinomycin G and actinomycin Y [1,2,3] (SI, Table S1). Some actinomycin analogues, such as methylated actinomycin D [4], an actinomycin Z analogue having an additional oxygen bridge between the chromophore and \u03b2-depsipentapeptide [5], actinomycins D1\u2013D4 [6] and neo-actinomycins A and B [7], possess structurally modified cyclopeptide rings or chromophore (SI, Table S1). Initiatives to develop actinomycin analogues with superior bioactivities have been heavily rooted in precursor-directed biosynthesis [8]. Actinomycins, commonly employed clinically in anticancer therapeutic regimes, exhibit excellent antitumor activity. The core phenoxazinone chromophore intercalates between the stacked nucleobases at guanine/cytosine sites of DNA whereas the pentapeptide elements bind to the minor groove; these binding interactions effectively inhibit duplication and transcription processes in tumor cells [9]. Exemplary in this fashion, actinomycin D is a highly effective chemotherapeutic used to treat Wilm\u2019s kidney tumors, trophoblastic tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma [2]. Actinomycin D also specifically targets and down-regulates the expression of stem-cell transcription factor, Sox-2; this protein facilitates depletion of the stem-cell population resulting in the inability of breast cancer cells to initiate tumor progression [10]. Low doses of actinomycin D specifically activate p53-dependant transcription enhancing the activity of chemotherapeutic drug-induced killing of p53 positive human tumor cells [11]. Actinomycins are also able to inhibit some viruses such as the coxsackie virus B3 and HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS [12,13]. The combination of these novel activities and potential in human health makes actinomycin D one of the most promising candidates for medicinal development campaigns. Moreover, the actinomycins often display strong antimicrobial activities. Potent antibacterial activities against human pathogens, human pathogenic fungi, as well as aquatic pathogenic bacteria are well known [14]. For instance, actinomycin X2 kills both resting and budding spores of Bacillus megaterium and actinomycin Xo\u03b2 has pronounced anti-tuberculosis activities [15]. Notably, despite these very favorable activities, clinical applications of actinomycin D are often limited by undesirable side-effects; liver and kidney damage rank high on this list of detrimental side-effects [16].", "Recent progress in genome research has revealed the presence of the actinomycin D biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in S. chrysomallus. The gene cluster was found to encompass 50 kb of contiguous DNA on the chromosome of S. chrysomallus and to contain 28 biosynthetic genes bordered on both sides by IS (Insertion Sequence) elements [17]. Remarkably, 9 of the genes embedded within the actinomycin D BGC have two copies, all of which are in the same order but in the opposite orientation; such an arrangement of genes within a BGC is unprecedented. Sequencing of the actinomycin BGC in S. antibioticus IMRU 3720, which produces actinomycin D, also revealed 20 genes organized into a similar framework but without gene duplicates as in the actinomycin D biosynthetic gene cluster of S. chrysomallus [18]. In addition, the actinomycin G BGC in S. iakyrus was identified and reported in 2013 [19].", "A defining feature of the actinomycins is a central phenoxazinone chromophore which serves to bridge two pentapeptide lactones consisting of diverse amino acids. The pentapeptide precursor is biosynthesized by the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly line with the 4-methyl-3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid (4-MHA) as the initiating unit [20,21]. The biosynthesis of 4-MHA differs in various actinomycin-producing strains. For example, in S. chrysomallus, Streptosporangium sibiricum and S. parvulus, tryptophan is implicated as a substrate for tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase which primarily forms the important MHA precursor, N-formyl kynurenine (Figure 2). N-formyl kynurenine then serves as a substrate for kynurenine formamidase and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; the actions of these two enzymes produce 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and this sequence of chemistries is apparent in all actinomycin producers. Methylation of 3-HK then affords 4-methyl-3-hydroxy-kynurenine (4-MHK). 4-MHK is then catalyzed by hydroxykynureninase to form 4-MHA. Some deviations in this chemistry are seen, however, based on the precise actinomycin producer in question. For instance, in S. antibioticus, tryptophan is converted to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HA) which is subsequently processed by a methyltransferase to form 4-MHA [22].", "Perhaps one of the more intriguing questions associated with actinomycin assembly has to do with the final step of actinomycin D biosynthesis and how two molecules of MHA-pentapeptide converge, via phenoxazinone assembly, to generate the intact actinomycin. Phenoxazinone synthase (PHS), a 650 aa, two copper-containing phenoloxidase, has long been theorized to mediate this final step [23]. Once cloned and expressed in vitro, PHS was characterized and anticipated to activate MHA-pentapeptide monomers for subsequent dimerization reactions [24,25]. However, in the actinomycin-producer S. antibioticus IMRU 3720, actinomycin D production persisted in an inactivated \u2206phsA mutant [26], suggesting that the putative phenoxazinone synthase is not essential for actinomycin assembly. Hence, the mechanism by which the two MHA-pentapeptide monomers come together to form intact actinomycins remains largely unclear.", "Enabled by high quality genomic scanning and analyses, we report here the identification of a distinct 39.8 kb gene cluster from S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073, a previously identified actinomycin D and actinomycin Xo\u03b2 producer [27]. We have defined the gene cluster boundaries and described the organization of the complete biosynthetic gene cluster as guided by the results of gene insertions and metabolic profile analyses. Interestingly, we have discovered that, within the upstream and downstream regions of the cluster, can be found regulatory genes acnW, acnR, acnU4 and acnO. Our study expands insights into how actinomycin titers and structural diversities stand to be improved via the application of combinatorial biosynthetic approaches. Holistically speaking, actinomycin analogs with reduced toxicities and improved bioactivities represent important goals for the downstream application of new knowledge reported herein."]
