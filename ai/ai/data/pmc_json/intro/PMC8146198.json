["1. Introduction", "Laurel wilt is a lethal disease of susceptible plants in the family Lauraceae, a group containing over 600 species including avocado, red bay, swamp bay, and sassafras [1]. This disease is now endemic in the southeastern United States, where it is caused by the invasive ambrosia fungus, Raffaelea lauricola (Ascomycota: Ophiostomatales). The fungus is vectored to host plants by at least 10 different species of native and invasive ambrosia beetles within specialized fungal transport organs termed mycangia [2,3]. Beetle vectors burrow into the sapwood of lauraceous hosts, excavating galleries where they raise their brood and farm their symbiotic ambrosia fungus partner as their sole food source (ambrosia symbiosis) [4,5]. Upon exposure to R. lauricola, infected trees exhibit rapid wilting of terminal leaves and branches, leading to the death of part or all of the tree [6,7]. Wilting is preceded by the development of internal symptoms that include tylose and gel deposition, which impede water transport through blocked xylem vessel elements [8]. This disease has advanced throughout the southeastern United States largely unchecked and is responsible for the death of over 500 million trees since its introduction less than two decades ago. In 2012, laurel wilt was first detected in the avocado growing region of Florida, thus threatening a multi-billion-dollar industry with yearly projections of up to 50\u201360 million dollars in losses [9,10]. Although the exact mechanisms of pathogenesis exerted by this fungus on host trees remain obscure, during invasion, fungal cells must overcome host defenses by detoxifying plant defense compounds and locating suitable carbon sources for growth. Some fungi, and potentially R. lauricola, may have the capability to subsist on the gel contents deposited by plants within xylem vessels [11,12,13]. An analysis of the gel contents of laurel wilt-infected trees revealed that their primary components were pectins, phenolics, and lipids, suggesting that detoxification of phenolics and assimilation and utilization of lipids and other host carbon sources may be important strategies for fungal growth and survival within host trees [8].", "Additionally, fungal cells contained within the mycangia of beetle hosts must subsist on secretions, which have been described as oily, waxy, and slightly acidic, from glandular cells in or near these symbiotic organs during dispersal to new host trees [14,15]. Ambrosia beetle mycangia have been shown to selectively promote the active growth of symbiotic ambrosia fungi, while suppressing the growth of non-symbiotic or contaminating fungi, suggesting an as-of-yet undescribed mechanism by which these organs maintain cultivar purity across beetle generations [16]. To date, the glandular secretions from these organs remain poorly characterized; however, the mycangium lumen into which they flow has been demonstrated to contain fatty acids, phospholipids, free sterols, sterol esters, triglycerides, and an abundance of amino acids including alanine, valine, and especially proline [15]. It is believed that the composition of these glandular secretions and luminal spaces may contribute to the sustained high-fidelity interaction between fungal symbiont and insect host [17]. As such, approaches that examine the metabolic potential of R. lauricola to utilize different substrates, as well as its cellular phenotype when grown on these substrates, could yield useful insights into the biology of this fungus and how it interacts with its hosts.", "Phenotype microarrays are medium-throughput techniques that allow for the simultaneous characterization and monitoring of microbial cellular attributes under thousands of different conditions, including exposure to different drugs and chemicals, making them attractive methods for studying the metabolic capacity and cellular phenotypes of cells on a wide variety of substrates [18,19]. Tools for such \u201cphenomic\u201d characterizations include the Biolog (Hayward, CA, United States) phenotype microarray that can test for the presence or absence of a large range of specific cellular phenotypes, including the interrogation of metabolic pathways along with ionic, osmotic and pH effects. In addition, a detailed assessment of the utilization patterns of exogenous lipids with different chemical properties by fungi and their subsequent cellular phenotypes is warranted. Lipids, such as fatty acids, are important carbon sources for many fungi and, in some species, have been shown to represent an essential currency between symbiotic partners. Mycorrhizal fungi, for instance, are noted fatty acid auxotrophs and obtain these compounds from their plant host [20]. Fatty acids also play important roles in host sensing and signaling by pathogenic fungi. In the corn smut fungus, Ustilago maydis, growth on a triacylglyceride mixture containing corn oil induces a morphological switch from budding cells to filamentous growth, a switch associated with pathogenesis [21,22]. Fatty acid metabolites also affect the morphogenesis of the human pathogenic fungus, Candida albicans, and metabolites of fatty acids can be used as quorum sensing molecules by this fungus [23,24].", "Once incorporated into cells, fatty acids are converted to neutral lipids in the endoplasmic reticulum and stored in organelles termed lipid droplets [25]. Lipid droplets (LD) are unique cellular organelles consisting of a neutral lipid core made primarily of triacylglycerols (TAG) and sterol esters (SE) and enclosed by a monolayer of phospholipids, distinguishing them from other organelles that have aqueous cores and phospholipid bilayers [26,27]. LDs contain dozens of different proteins on their surfaces, form tight associations with other organelles and cellular structures, and play essential roles in diverse cellular processes such as energy homeostasis, oxidative stress, detoxification, membrane stability, and gene regulation [28,29,30,31,32]. A number of bacterial and fungal pathogens use their own lipid droplets, or exploit host lipid droplets, as a means of initiating and maintaining infection [33,34,35]. The rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, for instance, mobilizes lipid droplets during infection structure (appressoria) formation, where they are degraded for use as energy stores and for maintaining the extremely high turgor pressure necessary to infect its host by mechanical penetration of tissues [36,37]. Lipid droplets also aid fungi in sequestering and thereby overcoming the toxic effects of exogenous and endogenous lipophilic toxins, which may play a key role in overcoming host defenses, as well as maintaining self-resistance to endogenous toxic compounds stored in fungal cells [38]", "A number of studies have examined the fungicide sensitivities of R. lauricola, and temperature and pH profiling indicated unique features of the fungus that include cold adaptation and poor growth at pH > 7.5 [39,40,41]. Here, using phenotyping arrays, we significantly expand characterization of the R. lauricola phenome to include a broad range of substrate utilization responses. In addition, we performed: (a) an examination of the dynamic range of R. lauricola fatty acid utilization, (2) a comparative analysis of LD visualization methods for assessing LD dynamics, and (c) characterizing the effects of fatty acids on LD formation. These data provide a critical baseline phenome for Raffaelea lauricola and provide tools for the assessment of fatty acid and LD formation in the growth and development of the fungus during saprophytic growth, symbiotic association (with beetles), and/or tree infection."]
