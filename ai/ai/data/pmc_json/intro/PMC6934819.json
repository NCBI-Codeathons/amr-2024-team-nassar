["Introduction", "2,5-Diketopiperazines (DKPs) are a class of molecules characterized by the presence of the piperazine-2,5-dione ring obtained by the condensation of two alpha amino acids. Specialised metabolites with a DKP scaffold are produced by a wide range of microorganisms and present various interesting biological properties, including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral or antitumoral activity1. Among the DKPs, bicyclomycin (1), also known as aizumycin or bicozamycin (Fig.\u00a01a), is a highly oxidized, clinically-relevant molecule with a unique mechanism of action. The ability of bicyclomycin to disrupt the activity of the bacterial termination factor Rho2,3 has been used to treat enteropathogenic Escherichia coli that causes diarrhoea in humans and livestock animals3,4. Moreover, the use of bicyclomycin in combination with bacteriostatic concentrations of protein synthesis inhibitors dramatically enhances its bactericidal properties and potential clinical utility5.Figure 1Bicyclomycin and its biosynthetic gene cluster. (a) Structure of the bicyclomycin molecule; (b) schematic representation of the bicyclomycin biosynthetic gene cluster and its flanking regions. The predicted functions of the proteins encoded by the cluster are: BcmH: MFS transporter; BcmA: cyclodipeptide synthase; BcmB, C, E, F, G: 2OG/Fe dioxygenase; BcmD: cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. The blue line indicates the extent of the insert cloned in pJWe14.

Streptomyces aizunensis7 and Streptomyces griseoflavus8 have since been reported as producers. In bacteria, the synthesis of the DKP core can be catalysed either by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) or by cyclodipeptide synthases (CDPSs)9. At the outset of our investigation into the biosynthesis of bicyclomycin only the first and last intermediate were proposed: cyclo-(l-isoleucyl-l-leucyl) (cIL) (2) and dihydrobicyclomycin (3), respectively10. During the final steps of our work, which focused on S. cinnamoneus, several studies on bicyclomycin biosynthesis that used in vitro approaches or heterologous expression were published, identifying biosynthetic genes and proposing a biosynthetic pathway for bicyclomycin in both Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria11\u201313.", "Our work provides in vivo data that corroborate the results obtained in vitro on the biosynthetic pathway of bicyclomycin, establish the stereochemistry of several biosynthetic intermediates and demonstrate the dispensable nature of the transporter associated with the biosynthetic gene cluster in S. cinnamoneus."]
