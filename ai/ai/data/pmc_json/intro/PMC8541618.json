["1. Introduction", "In the early 1950s, the glycopeptide vancomycin was isolated from Amycolatopsis orientalis and soon emerged as a promising new treatment for infections caused by penicillin-resistant staphylococci and other Gram-positive bacteria [1,2]. Early studies showed that the compound successfully cleared staphylococcal infections and did not induce resistance in serial-passaging experiments [1,3,4]. Thus, vancomycin was greeted as an attractive alternative to penicillin and was swiftly approved for clinical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1958 [1,5,6]. Impurities present in early vancomycin preparations gave rise to significant toxicity, but improved formulations overcame most of these issues; nonetheless, perceptions about toxicity lingered [1,7]. At the same time, alternatives became available (e.g., methicillin), and as a result vancomycin was used only sparingly until the early 1980s, when the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus prompted its use as an antibiotic of last resort [8,9,10,11,12]. Vancomycin also became a popular treatment option for enterococcal infections, which are tolerant of or resistant to some other antibiotic classes [13,14]. This increased use of vancomycin encouraged the development and spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).", "VRE infection was first identified as an emerging clinical problem in the late 1980s, nearly 30 years after vancomycin made its debut [15,16]. Today, VRE are recognized as a pressing clinical concern [17,18,19]. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium is listed among the so-called ESKAPE pathogens (E. faecium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) [20], and the World Health Organization has also identified VRE as a high priority for the development of new antibiotics [21]. VRE levels continue to increase, and the prevalence of VRE infections\u2014nearly 55,000 cases reported in the US alone in 2017\u2014emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of how VRE function [22,23,24]. An important aspect of VRE pathology is the regulatory system that controls expression of the resistance phenotype; this review aims to provide an update on the molecular mechanisms by which vancomycin resistance is regulated in enterococci."]
