["Introduction", "Streptomyces are soil-dwelling prokaryotes with a capability to generate numerous bioactive secondary metabolites that are harnessed for medical usage as antibiotics, anticancer agents and immunosuppressants (Newman and Cragg 2020). A key feature of microbial natural products is their chemical complexity and diversity. Surprisingly, much of this chemodiversity is generated via a limited number of biosynthetic systems that classify secondary metabolites to the main classes of polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, ribosomally synthesized, and post-translationally modified peptides, and terpenes (Fewer and Mets\u00e4-Ketel\u00e4 2020).", "Aromatic polyketides are a large subgroup of secondary metabolites that harbour a wide range of pharmaceutical functions (Medema et al. 2015), which include the antibacterial tetracycline (Pickens and Tang 2009) and the anticancer agent doxorubicin (Hulst et al. 2021). One extensively studied type-II polyketide is the benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) antibiotic actinorhodin synthesized by the model organism Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (Okamoto et al. 2009; Taguchi et al. 2013; Hashimoto et al. 2023). Other notable examples of BIQ polyketide antibiotics include naphthocyclinones, alnumycin, granaticin and medermycin (Mets\u00e4-Ketel\u00e4 et al. 2013) (Fig.\u00a01). Naphthocyclinones pertinent to this study were originally discovered in 1974 from Streptomyces arenae DSM 40737 (Zeeck and Mardin 1974, Zeeck et al. 1974) and subsequently confirmed to be asymmetrical dimers (Krone et al. 1982, Ando et al. 2015). Three different conformations of naphthocyclinones, the \u03b1, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-forms, have been identified, but only the \u03b2- and \u03b3-forms show bioactivities against Gram-positive bacteria (Br\u00fcnker et al. 2001). One notable difference between actinorhodin and naphthocyclinone is the mode of dimerization, since the two monomers are joined together either by one or two C-C bonds, respectively.", "Figure 1.Chemical structures of actinorhodin, alnumycin, granaticin, medermycin, and the \u03b1, \u03b2-forms of naphthocyclinone.", "Chemical structures of actinorhodin, alnumycin, granaticin, medermycin, and the \u03b1, \u03b2-forms of naphthocyclinone.", "Early 13C labelling experiments have indicated that both actinorhodin and naphthocyclinone are formed via dimerization of two 16-carbon polyketides (Schr\u00f6der and Floss 1978, Gorst-Allman et al. 1981). The molecular genetics of actinorhodin biosynthesis have been studied since the 1970s (Rudd and Hopwood 1979). The carbon chain is synthesized from eight malonyl-CoA units via iterative Claisen condensations by the ketosynthase \u03b1 (KS\u03b1)/KS\u03b2 heterodimer. The highly reactive polyketide is tethered to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to prevent aberrant cyclization events. The polyketide is folded to a bicyclic intermediate that is released from the ACP by a distinct 9-ketoreductase (9-KR), first ring aromatase/cyclase (ARO/CYC) and second ring cyclase (CYC). Next 3-ketoreduction (3-KR) promotes pyran ring cyclization and the monomer unit of actinorhodin, dihydrokalafungin, is formed by a set of redox enzymes (Mets\u00e4-Ketel\u00e4 et al. 2013). The atypical short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) ActVA-4 has been implicated in the dimerization reaction, since inactivation of the gene resulted in the accumulation of 8-hydroxy-dihydrolalafungin (Taguchi et al. 2012).", "In contrast, the biosynthesis of naphthocyclinone has received considerably less attention to date. Earlier work identified two DNA fragments from the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) (Sherman et al. 1989, Br\u00fcnker et al. 1999, 2001) and very recently the genes were identified from the genome sequence of S. eurocidicus CGMCC 4.108 (Li et al. 2023). Here we have sequenced the genome of S. arenae DSM 40737 and captured the BGC for heterologous production of naphthocyclinone in S. albus J1074. We provide experimental evidence that ncnN and actVA-3 are involved in the dimerization of naphthocyclinone and actinorhodin, respectively."]
