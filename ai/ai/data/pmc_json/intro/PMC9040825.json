["INTRODUCTION", "Antibiotic resistance is one of the threatening problems in public health. More than 700,000 people die of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria annually (1, 2). The main mechanisms of antibiotic resistance are reduction in the drug influx, enhancement of the drug efflux, inactivation of the drug, and modification of the drug target (3\u20135). In addition to these quintessential resistance mechanisms that are often acquired by spontaneous mutation and/or horizontal gene transfer, recent studies suggest that the intrinsic physiological responses could affect the efficacy of not just a single antibiotic but multiple antibiotics, although they are not directly associated with the antibiotic mode of action (6, 7). For example, the stringent response involving (p)ppGpp alarmone contributes to antibiotic resistance (8, 9): inactivation of the genes for (p)ppGpp synthesis sensitizes the bacterial cells to different classes of antibiotics, allowing enhanced antibiotic efficacy in experimental infections. Production of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can induce antibiotic resistance, and the chemicals that inhibit H2S production render the bacterial cells hypersusceptible to antibiotics (10). Moreover, alterations in the anabolic and/or catabolic pathways could also affect the efficacy of multiple antibiotics, although they are ultimately affected by the inhibitory or lethal activity of the antibiotics (11, 12). These physiological responses are regarded as the intrinsic resistance mechanisms that function irrespective of the primary targets of antibiotics and are relatively conserved among bacterial species (13).", "The Streptomyces species are well-studied soil-dwelling bacteria famous for producing many commercially available antibiotics and other clinically important drugs (14). As vigorous antibiotic producers, streptomycetes are inevitably equipped with specialized resistance mechanisms to protect themselves specifically from endogenously produced antibiotics (15, 16). Nevertheless, the intrinsic or generalized resistance mechanisms have not been well defined in Streptomyces spp. except for a few examples. In Streptomyces coelicolor, a model organism for Streptomyces biology (17), a transcriptional regulator (WblC/WhiB7) is known to control intrinsic resistance to ribosome-targeting antibiotics similar to its role in the pathogenic actinomycete bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (18, 19). It is noteworthy that the WblC/WhiB7 regulon includes not only the specialized resistance genes for drug efflux and modification but also genes for more general functions to confer resistance by modifying ribosome and translation machinery, gene transcription, and metabolism (18). Thus, more complicated resistance determinants that this antibiotic-producing bacterium exploits deserve further research to elucidate the mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to antibiotics.", "Herein, we demonstrate that iron promotes the resistance of S. coelicolor to bactericidal antibiotics by changing cell metabolism. Iron is an essential nutrient for most microorganisms and is relatively rich in the soil environment (20), which implies the potential impact of iron utilization in this soil bacterium. We profiled the transcriptomic responses to antibiotics under iron-replete conditions to identify the dramatic changes in the genes for central metabolism and respiration. More importantly, iron could induce altered respiration in S. coelicolor and in Mycobacterium smegmatis as well, accounting for the intrinsic resistance of both actinomycete bacteria to the bactericidal antibiotics."]
