["1. Introduction", "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major cause of human suffering that impairs the trust relationships between doctors and their patients, concomitant with huge economic losses. In this world of microbe-man cohabitation, survival of the human species will be threatened without health-giving microbes, and there will be no way to survive the emergence of MDR superbugs. Hence, from a health perspective, antibiotics have been our best strategy. The impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a huge concern, which results in the greatest loss to individual and social economy [1]. It is estimated that by 2050, the death rate due to AMR will balloon to 10 million lives per year at an expense of one hundred trillion dollars [1,2]. Today the rapid development of MDR in microorganisms is increasing global health problems and presents a challenge for the treatment of infectious diseases that scientists claim could return to the level of the pre-antibiotic era [3]. Plants have played a unique holistic role for the provision of food, drugs, clothing, shelter, etc. Natural compounds have been extensively explored for new drug discoveries [4]. Indeed, plants have been used as medicines for more than 5000 years [3], as a source of antibiotics, antineoplastic, analgesics, cardioprotective, among others [5]. In the recent past, humans have been using natural compounds to ward off infections [6]. About 70\u201390% of the population in developing countries continue to use ancient medicines based on plant extracts [7]. The most powerful and promising elements of plants are their secondary metabolites, on which humans depend upon [8]. Significantly, natural products and their derivatives contribute to more than half of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs [9]. In the last two decades, most of the efforts have been attempts to discover novel therapeutics to combat MDR, especially with plants and deep-sea flora [10,11]. In general, natural products covers several interactions including the relationship between matter and life. Biological theories related to molecular biology and genetics, physiological and pathological theories, food, diseases, poisons, and antidotes. Such interactions give a wide range of possible uses for the secondary metabolites and their synthetic or semisynthetic derivates [12].", "The disciplines of ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology define \u201cmedicinal plant\u201d as those species used in traditional medicine that contain beneficial elements in healing diseases in humans and/or animals. The objective of ethnopharmacology is to develop a drug to treat patients, and ultimately to validate traditional use of medicinal plants.", "Throughout human history, the isolation and identification of biologically active compounds and molecules from nature has led to the discovery of new therapeutics, prompting the improvement of the health and pharmaceutical sectors [13]. Phytochemicals revolve around the research and development (R&D) sector of the pharmaceutical industries as a source of new molecules leading to the development of new novel drugs [6]. For instance, in the oncology sector, plants have contributed more than 60% of the anti-cancer drugs, directly or indirectly. Natural products provide about 50% of modern drugs [14]. In the last three decades, antimicrobial resistance has led to the emergence of MDR, as a consequence of the repeated and regular use of single drugs for the same therapeutic target. Therefore, it is a warning for the pharmaceutical scientists to provide a new weapon against MDR and an opportunity to search for a new spectrum of antibiotics to fight AMR [15]. Natural products are a potential supply for novel biologically active compounds that could lead to the innovation of new therapeutics [16,17].", "Two of the main living traditions that exist even today are the Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM) i.e., Ayurveda, and the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which have been knit together to contribute to diverse knowledge of therapeutic plants. Both of them have potentially contributed with a long list of plants and phytomedicines used nowadays around the world, and their input to regulate herbal drugs in the pharmacy industry [18]. In China, TCM is already playing an important role in treating infectious diseases [19] and several potential compounds are already undergoing clinical trials from Ayurveda [20]. In both traditional systems (TIM and TCM), medicines were prepared as herbal products in different formulations such us powders, tinctures, poultices, and teas to be used based on the type of disease being treated. Herbal medicines are a special branch of traditional knowledge about life dealing with both body and mind [21]. A vast majority of the global population depend on the traditional medicines for health care. Concerns are being raised related to the development of MDR as well as the side effects caused due to the introduction of drug molecules. The synthesis of Salvarsan, an arsenic based drug for syphilis in 1910, the development of Prontosil, a sulpha drug in 1935, and a penicillin purified and produced in early 1940s led to the opening of the door for future drug discovery research. The wide spread antibiotic resistance, which is observed currently, is causing public health concerns by medical researchers warning about a return to the pre-antibiotic era [22]. To date, there are no effective antimicrobial, which could cure all bacterial infections. Knowledge about the traditional medicine is undergoing generational loss of this wisdom [23].
