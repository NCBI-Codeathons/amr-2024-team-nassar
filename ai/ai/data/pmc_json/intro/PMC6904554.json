["Introduction", "The term \u201cproteome\u201d was first proposed in 1995, originating from the hybridization of \u201cprotein\u201d with \u201cgenome\u201d, and refers to \u201call proteins expressed in a cell or an organism\u201d1,2. The characterization of proteomes has since contributed substantially to our understanding of different diseases, with the aim of gaining insight into the cellular signaling pathways underlying disease and the discovery of novel biomarkers for screening, early detection, and diagnosis, as well as to determine and predict the responses to specific treatments3. Compared to the static nature of the genome, the plant proteome is highly complex and dynamic. As proteins are an important part of the main signal transduction and biochemical pathways, studying the protein abundance is essential for revealing the molecular mechanism of plant growth, development, and interaction with the environment4. Quantitative proteomics refers to the mass spectrometry detection of specific known proteins without the need for the full detection of all unknown proteins.", "Two kinds of innate immune mechanisms have formed during the long-term co-evolution between plants and pathogens. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced resistance mechanisms (PAMP-triggered immunity, PTI), and the pathogen effector protein (Effector)-induced resistance mechanisms (effector-triggered immunity, ETI). PTI recognizes PAMPs-a conservative structural molecule of pathogens-by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the plant cell surface, which then activates basic defense responses in plants. Chitin and dextran from pathogenic fungi are examples of PAMPs that induce PTI responses in plants5. In Arabidopsis thaliana, chitin can be recognized, bound, and activated by receptor-like protein kinase CERK1 (chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1) containing the LysM domain6. Studies have shown that OsCEBiP (hychitin elicitor binding protein) and LysM domain proteins LYP4 and LYP6 (lysin motif-containing proteins) are involved in the identification of chitin in the cell wall of pathogenic fungi7. ETI relies on plant disease resistance proteins (R proteins) recognizing the effector proteins secreted by pathogens either directly or indirectly, thus triggering a strong resistance response to inhibit the infection of pathogens, which usually manifests as a HR (hypersensitive response). In rice, AvrPiz-t, a nontoxic effector protein of Magnaporthe grisea, significantly inhibited the PTI response induced by flagellin and chitin. It was found that AvrPiz-t inhibited the PTI response mediated by APIP6 by interfering with the activity of ubiquitin ligase APIP68, revealing that effector proteins of pathogenic bacteria could inhibit plant disease resistance by interfering with the degradation system of ubiquitin proteins.", "Technological developments make MS (mass spectrometry)-based proteomics a central pillar of biochemical research. At present, iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) technology and TMT (tandem mass tag) technology are the main technologies used for the quantitative analysis of differential proteomics mass spectrometry9,10. Particularly, TMT chemical labeling quantitative proteomics technology has become a very important mass spectrometry quantitative method11. In order to reveal Brassica napus defense mechanisms against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the proteomes of B. napus leaves inoculated with S. sclerotiorum wild-type strain 1980 and nonpathogenic mutant strain Ep-1PB, as well as an empty agar plug as the control, were analyzed using the TMT label-based quantitative analysis technique. In total, there were 79 differentially expressed proteins in the nonpathogenic mutant strain EP-1pb and empty agar plug, 299 differentially expressed proteins in the S. sclerotiorum wild-type strain 1980 and empty agar plug, and 173 differentially expressed proteins in the S. sclerotiorum wild-type strain 1980 and nonpathogenic mutant strain EP-1pb. The differential expression of 12 selected proteins was confirmed by RT-qPCR (real-time fluorescence quantitative) analysis. This provides a new molecular mechanism for the defense response of Brassica napus to S. sclerotiorum and helps to screen for resistant proteins12. Liu et al. used TMT quantitative proteomics coupled with UPLC MS/MS (ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry) to analyze the physiology and proteomics of tea plants treated with different fluorides, and analyzed the molecular mechanism of fluoride accumulation/detoxification in tea plants13. PRM (parallel reaction monitoring) technology is an important method in the current targeted proteomics research, allowing simultaneous monitoring of all transitions as a full MS/MS scanning profile and thus provides an enhanced selectivity and confidence in quantitation of each analyzed target protein14. Recently, this technology combined with iTRAQ or TMT is widely used in the proteome in the pharmaceutical and environmental industries15\u201317. However, there is few studies in the area of plant, especially in plant-pathogen interactions18,19.", "Bambusa pervariabilis McClure\u2009\u00d7\u2009Dendrocalamopsis grandis (Q.H.Dai & X.l.Tao ex Keng f.) Ohrnb., which is a species of hybrid bamboo with B. pervaiabilis and D. grandis as the male and female parents, has been extensively planted in southern China due to its characteristically advantageous abilities of growth and reproduction. It is often involved in the process of afforestation along rivers, which not only increases overall bamboo resources, but also conserves water and soil and improves the ecology in multiple different environments20, including the reinstatement of farmland and ecological forest construction along the Changjiang river basin in China21. However, one destructive disease, hybrid bamboo blight occurs in many provinces of China, causing the dead area of hybrid bamboo to reach 3000 hm2. Zhu et al.22,23, members of our research term, affirmed that Arthrinium phaeospermum (Corda) Elli started to infect the bamboo through conidia from April to May, spreading between individuals. The disease outbreak occurred in August-September, overwintered in October, and proceeded to infect more bamboo via conidia in the wind and rain in the second year. The pathogen belongs to Fungi, Dikarya, Ascomycota, Pezizomycotina, Sordariomycetes, Xylariomycetidae, Xylariales, Apiosporaceae, Arthrinium24. In our previous studies, the pathogenic toxin of A. phaeospermum had been clarified21,25,26, and the metabolomics responses of the bamboo to pathogenic fungal stress has been achieved by us this year27. However, the substrate of the metabolic pathways and the protein-substances of the metabolites remain unknown.", "Pathogen-related molecular patterns and effector proteins can be recognized by plant surface pattern receptors and disease-resistant proteins, which can stimulate the resistance reaction of corresponding resistance proteins in plants to inhibit the infection of pathogens. Therefore, it is of great significance to search for disease resistance protein genes of bamboo shoot blight by comparing the proteomes of hybrid bamboo when inoculated with either A. phaeospermum or sterile water. In this study, the differential expression of proteins in hybrid bamboo inoculated with either pathogenic fungus A. phaeospermum or sterile water as a control were studied by using TMT protein quantitative technology and LC\u2013MS/MS mass spectrometry. Then, PRM technology was used to quantitatively characterize target proteins with important biological functions among the differentially expressed proteins. We aimed to dissect the network of protein changes associated with the plant-pathogen interaction, thus deepening our understanding of its mechanism at the molecular level, and providing insights and guidance to control hybrid bamboo blight."]
