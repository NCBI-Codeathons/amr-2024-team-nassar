["1. Introduction", "Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an opportunistic pathogen that is especially dangerous for patients with cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiencies, cancer (particularly lung cancer), and those exposed to immunosuppressive therapy, mechanical ventilation, and catheters. The critically ill patients from intensive care units, as well as patients hospitalized for long periods, especially after broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, are most exposed to S. maltophilia infections [1,2,3]. It is worth emphasizing that infections caused by S. maltophilia are characterized by a high mortality rate, even up to 69% in patients with bacteremia. Infections occur in both adults and children. Although it is mainly a nosocomial pathogen, community-acquired infections are also observed. An increase in the incidence of S. maltophilia infections in the global population, from 1.3% to 1.7%, was observed between 2007\u20132012 [4].", "The most important problem in the treatment of infections caused by S. maltophilia is an intrinsic resistance of this bacterium to a wide range of antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents. The drug of choice for the treatment of S. maltophilia infections is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [2,5]. However, a slow but continuous increase in the number of the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant strains is observed worldwide. Resistance rates in the world usually range between 1\u201320%; however, higher resistance levels have been reported both in Europe (Spain: 27%) and in other continents (Turkey: 10\u201315%, Taiwan: up to 25%, China: 30\u201348%) [6,7,8]. Other therapeutic options include the use of fluoroquinolones, minocycline, and ticarcillin/clavulanate. Recently, it has been revealed that fluoroquinolones, an alternative treatment, are equally as effective as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [9,10,11]. Levofloxacin was most frequently used among fluoroquinolones (187 of 331, 56.5%), followed by ciprofloxacin (114 of 331, 34.4%) [10]. Generally, resistance rates to levofloxacin of S. maltophilia strains are relatively similar or higher than that of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and range between 3% and 30% [9,12,13]. In our previous publication, all 94 investigated S. maltophilia clinical isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and minocycline, but 7 of them were resistant and 37 were intermediately susceptible to levofloxacin [14].", "The resistance to fluoroquinolones in S. maltophilia strains is caused by two main mechanisms: an overexpression of multidrug-resistant (MDR) efflux pumps and chromosomally encoded Qnr proteins (SmQnr). Five families (superfamilies) of efflux pumps are described. One of them, ABC (ATP-binding cassette) family, gets its energy from ATP disruption. The other 4 families are proton pumps. Of these, the MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion) family may also take advantage of the differences in sodium ion concentration gradients. It is worth emphasizing that the pumps from the RND (resistance-nodulation-division) family are of the greatest importance for the resistance of Gram-negative bacteria. Unlike the others, pumps from the RND family can extrude antimicrobial agents from various chemical groups from the cells. Twelve MDR efflux systems have been identified in S. maltophilia so far. These systems were classified into three families of MDR efflux pumps: RND, ABC, and MFS (major facilitator superfamily). The following efflux systems, SmeDEF [15], SmeMN [14], SmeABC [16], SmeYZ [17], SmeIJK [17], SmeVWX [18], SmeOP [19], and SmeGH [20], are described from the RND family. The other four efflux pumps, SmrA [21], MacABCsm [22], SmaCDEF, and SmaAB [23], belong to the ABC family. Moreover, in S. maltophilia, the presence of the EmrCABsm system [24] from the MFS family has been described and the FuaABC pump [25] is unclassified as of yet. Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, are substrates for most of these RND efflux systems. The following fluoroquinolone-removing efflux pumps, 5 from the RND family\u2014smeDEF [15], SmeABC [16], SmeVWX [18], SmeGH [20], SmeIJK [17], and one from the ABC family\u2014SmrA [21,26], have been identified so far. The best investigated efflux systems of S. maltophilia are SmeDEF and SmeVWX. Both of these systems are responsible for antibiotics extruding, except fluoroquinolones, as follows: SmeDEF\u2014trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, macrolides, tetracycline, and tigecycline, SmeVWX\u2014trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol. The RND efflux systems that occur in S. maltophilia, as in other Gram-negative rods, are encoded by genes organized in operons that are located in bacterial chromosomes. The relationship between operon overexpression of these two systems and the resistance of strains to fluoroquinolones has been demonstrated [15,18,27,28]. Expression of both of the above-mentioned efflux systems operons in S. maltophilia is regulated by local regulatory genes. The smeDEF operon is negatively regulated by the TetR-type transcriptional local repressor SmeT [29], whereas the smeVWX operon is regulated by the LysR-type transcription regulator-SmeRv [18]. Like many LysR-type regulators, SmeRv could act as a negative or positive regulator, depending on the presence of an activator ligand [18]. It has been described that mutations in smeT and smeRv regulatory genes are responsible for the overexpression of smeDEF and smeVWX efflux systems operons, respectively [30]. The third fluoroquinolone-removal efflux system is SmeABC, which also extrudes aminoglycosides and \u03b2-lactams [26]. A two-component regulatory system (TCS), SmeRS, is involved in expression of the smeABC operon [31]. The overproduction of the SmeGH efflux system leads to resistance to \u03b2-lactams, quinolones, tetracycline, and polymyxin B [20,32], while the SmeIJK efflux system confers resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, and minocycline, but it also has a role in adaptation to envelope stress [33]. The local regulatory systems of SmeGH and SmeIJK have not been characterized yet. The other important fluoroquinolone-resistance mechanism in S. maltophilia is the presence of qnr genes encoding the pentapeptide repeat proteins, which protects topoisomerase IV and gyrase from fluoroquinolones binding [26,34]. The mechanism associated with Smqnr proteins usually contributes to the low level of fluoroquinolone resistance in S. maltophilia [34]. However, Wu et al. demonstrated the high level of qnr genes transcription in 39% of fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical strains of S. maltophilia [35]. It can be underlined that S. maltophilia is the only known bacterium in which resistance to quinolones is not associated with mutations in genes encoding topoisomerases [36].", "In the previous article, we performed phenotypic and molecular characterization of the collection of 94 S. maltophilia clinical isolates, including the prevalence of efflux systems. The investigation revealed the presence of smeD and smeH genes in all isolates, smeW in 93 out of 94 isolates, smeI or smeK in 86, and smeA or smeB in 72 isolates [14]. Among them, 7 isolates were resistant, and 37 isolates demonstrated an intermediate level of susceptibility to levofloxacin.", "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of RND efflux systems in resistance to levofloxacin in S.maltophilia clinical strains isolated in Warsaw, Poland. The studies were conducted by analyzing the effect of known efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) on the decrease in minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of levofloxacin and other MDR efflux systems substrates, as well as by analyzing the expression of genes encoding the efflux systems that remove fluoroquinolones. In addition, we studied the local regulatory genes of RND efflux systems by sequencing DNA templates."]
