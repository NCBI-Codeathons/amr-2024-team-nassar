["Simple Summary", "Fluoroquinolones, mainly levofloxacin, are considered an alternative treatment option of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. However, an increase in the number of levofloxacin-resistant strains is observed worldwide. The fluoroquinolone resistance in S. maltophilia is usually caused by an overproduction of various multidrug efflux pumps, which are able to extrude antibiotics and chemotherapeutics from the bacterial cells. The purpose of the study was to analyze the contribution of efflux systems to levofloxacin resistance in S. maltophilia clinical strains, isolated in Warsaw, by phenotypic and molecular methods. Previously, the occurrence of genes encoding various ten efflux pumps was shown in 94 studied isolates. Additionally, 44 of 94 isolates demonstrated reduction in susceptibility to levofloxacin. In this study, in the presence of efflux pump inhibitors, an increase in levofloxacin susceptibility was observed in 13 isolates. The overexpression of genes encoding two efflux pump system, such as SmeDEF and Sme VWX (in five and one isolate, respectively), was demonstrated. Sequencing analysis revealed an amino acid change in the local regulators of these efflux pump operons. Our data indicate that the overproduction of the SmeVWX efflux system, unlike SmeDEF, plays a significant role in the levofloxacin resistance of the clinical isolates.", "Abstract", "Levofloxacin is considered an alternative treatment option of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The fluoroquinolone resistance in S. maltophilia is usually caused by an overproduction of efflux pumps. In this study, the contribution of efflux systems to levofloxacin resistance in S. maltophilia clinical isolates was demonstrated using phenotypic (minimal inhibitory concentrations, MICs, of antibiotics determination \u00b1 efflux pump inhibitors, EPIs) and molecular (real-time polymerase-chain-reaction and sequencing) methods. Previously, the occurrence of genes encoding ten efflux pumps was shown in 94 studied isolates. Additionally, 44/94 isolates demonstrated reduction in susceptibility to levofloxacin. Only 5 of 13 isolates (with \u22654-fold reduction in levofloxacin MIC) in the presence of EPIs showed an increased susceptibility to levofloxacin and other antibiotics. The overexpression of smeD and smeV genes (in five and one isolate, respectively) of 5 tested efflux pump operons was demonstrated. Sequencing analysis revealed 20\u201335 nucleotide mutations in local regulatory genes such as smeT and smeRv. However, mutations leading to an amino acid change were shown only in smeT (Arg123Lys, Asp182Glu, Asp204Glu) for one isolate and in smeRv (Gly266Ser) for the other isolate. Our data indicate that the overproduction of the SmeVWX efflux system, unlike SmeDEF, plays a significant role in the levofloxacin resistance."]
