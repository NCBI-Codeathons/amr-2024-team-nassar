["", "Surfactin, as one of the most powerful\nbiosurfactants, can be widely\napplied in agriculture, food, and pharmaceutics. However, low biosynthesis\nefficiency is the major obstacle in its commercialization. Here, we\nused nanoparticles to increase the surfactin production in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MT45 through enhancing\nthe secretion (the key step of surfactin biosynthesis). The results\nshowed that the surfactin titer increased from 4.93 to 7.15 g/L in\nthe flask and from 5.94 to 9.18 g/L in a 7 L bioreactor by adding\n5 g/L Fe nanoparticles. They were the highest titers in the reported\nwild-type strain. Our results indicated that Fe nanoparticles enhanced\nthe expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of surfactin.\nMoreover, Fe nanoparticles increased the permeability of cell membranes,\nresulting in a more efficient secretion of surfactin. This study provides\nan efficient strategy for increasing the biosynthesis of microbial\nmetabolites and provides new insights into the nanoparticles\u2019\nimpacts on microbes."]
