["Abstract", "Herein, we describe a new plasmid found in Sandaracinus\u2005sp. MSr10575 named pSa001 spanning 209.7\u2005kbp that harbors a cryptic secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC). Activation of this BGC by homologous\u2010recombination\u2010mediated exchange of the native promoter sequence against a vanillate inducible system led to the production and subsequent isolation and structure elucidation of novel secondary metabolites, the sandarazols\u2005A\u2013G. The sandarazols contain intriguing structural features and very reactive functional groups such as an \u03b1\u2010chlorinated ketone, an epoxyketone, and a (2R)\u20102\u2010amino\u20103\u2010(N,N\u2010dimethylamino)\u2010propionic acid building block. In\u2010depth investigation of the underlying biosynthetic machinery led to a concise biosynthetic model for the new compound family, including several uncommon biosynthetic steps. The chlorinated congener sandarazol\u2005C shows an IC50\u2005value of 0.5\u2005\u03bcm against HCT\u2005116 cells and a MIC of 14\u2005\u03bcm against Mycobacterium smegmatis, which points at the sandarazols\u2019 potential function as defensive secondary metabolites or toxins.", "Genetic activation artificially induced a plasmid\u2010encoded natural product biosynthetic gene cluster and activated the complex biosynthesis of a previously unknown cytotoxin named sandarazol. Its biosynthesis is unique in featuring the genetic blueprint for the formation of intriguing structural features such as an \u03b1\u2010chlorinated ketone, an epoxyketone, and a rare (2R)\u20102\u2010amino\u20103\u2010(N,N\u2010dimethylamino)\u2010propionic acid building block."]
