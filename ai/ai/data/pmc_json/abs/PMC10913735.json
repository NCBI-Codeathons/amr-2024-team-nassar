["ABSTRACT", "In the past century, microbial natural products have proven themselves to be substantial and fruitful sources of anti-infectives. In addition to the well-studied Actinobacteria, understudied bacterial taxa like the Gram-negative myxobacteria have increasingly gained attention in the ongoing search for novel and biologically active natural products. In the course of a regional sampling campaign to source novel myxobacteria, we recently uncovered new myxobacterial strains MCy12716 and MCy12733 belonging to the Myxococcaceae clade. Early bioactivity screens of the bacterial extracts revealed the presence of bioactive natural products that were identified as angiolam A and several novel derivatives. Sequencing of the corresponding producer strains allowed the identification of the angiolam biosynthetic gene cluster, which was verified by targeted gene inactivation. Based on bioinformatic analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster, a concise biosynthesis model was devised to explain angiolam biosynthesis. Importantly, novel angiolam derivatives uncovered in this study named angiolams B, C, and D were found to display promising antiparasitic activities against the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum in the 0.3\u20130.8 \u00b5M range.", "IMPORTANCE", "The COVID-19 pandemic and continuously emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have recently raised awareness about limited treatment options against infectious diseases. However, the shortage of treatment options against protozoal parasitic infections, like malaria, is much more severe, especially for the treatment of so-called neglected tropical diseases. The detection of anti-parasitic bioactivities of angiolams produced by MCy12716 and MCy12733 displays the hidden potential of scarcely studied natural products to have promising biological activities in understudied indications. Furthermore, the improved biological activities of novel angiolam derivatives against Plasmodium falciparum and the evaluation of its biosynthesis display the opportunities of the angiolam scaffold on route to treat protozoal parasitic infections as well as possible ways to increase the production of derivatives with improved bioactivities."]
