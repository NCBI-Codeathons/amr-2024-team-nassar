["", "Lanthipeptides\nare ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally\nmodified peptides (RiPPs) that display a wide variety of biological\nactivities, from antimicrobial to antiallodynic. Lanthipeptides that\ndisplay antimicrobial activity are called lantibiotics. The post-translational\nmodification reactions of lanthipeptides include dehydration of Ser\nand Thr residues to dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, a transformation\nthat is carried out in three unique ways in different classes of lanthipeptides.\nIn a cyclization process, Cys residues then attack the dehydrated\nresidues to generate the lanthionine and methyllanthionine thioether\ncross-linked amino acids from which lanthipeptides derive their name.\nThe resulting polycyclic peptides have constrained conformations that\nconfer their biological activities. After installation of the characteristic\nthioether cross-links, tailoring enzymes introduce additional post-translational\nmodifications that are unique to each lanthipeptide and that fine-tune\ntheir activities and/or stability. This review focuses on studies\npublished over the past decade that have provided much insight into\nthe mechanisms of the enzymes that carry out the post-translational\nmodifications."]
