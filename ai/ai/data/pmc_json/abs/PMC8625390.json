["Antibiotics are majorly important molecules for human health. Following the golden age of antibiotic discovery, a period of decline ensued, characterised by the rediscovery of the same molecules. At the same time, new culture techniques and high-throughput sequencing enabled the discovery of new microorganisms that represent a potential source of interesting new antimicrobial substances to explore. The aim of this review is to present recently discovered nonribosomal peptide (NRP) and polyketide (PK) molecules with antimicrobial activity against human pathogens. We highlight the different in silico/in vitro strategies and approaches that led to their discovery. As a result of technological progress and a better understanding of the NRP and PK synthesis mechanisms, these new antibiotic compounds provide an additional option in human medical treatment and a potential way out of the impasse of antibiotic resistance."]
