["Advances in understanding the pathological mechanisms of breast cancer have resulted in the emergence of novel therapeutic strategies. However, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a molecular subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis, lacks classical and general therapeutic targets, hindering the clinical application of several therapies to breast cancer. As insights into the unique immunity and molecular mechanisms of TNBC have become more extensive, immunotherapy has gradually become a valuable complementary approach to classical radiotherapy and chemotherapy. CD8+ cells are significant actors in the tumor immunity cycle; thus, research on TNBC immunotherapy is increasingly focused in this direction. Recently, CD8+ tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, a subpopulation of CD8+ cells, have been explored in relation to breast cancer and found to seemingly play an undeniably important role in tumor surveillance and lymphocytic infiltration. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the mechanisms and relative targets of CD8+ T cells, and discuss the features and potential applications of CD8+ TRM cells in non-luminal breast cancer immunotherapy."]
