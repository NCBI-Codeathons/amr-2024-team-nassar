["", "Fungi have historically been the source of numerous important\nmedicinal\ncompounds, but full exploitation of their genetic potential for drug\ndevelopment has been hampered in traditional discovery paradigms.\nHere we describe a radically different approach, top-down drug discovery\n(TD3), starting with a massive digital search through a\ndatabase of over 100,000 fully genomicized fungi to identify loci\nencoding molecules with a predetermined human target. We exemplify\nTD3 by the selection of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)\nas targets and the discovery of two molecules, 1 and 2, which inhibit therapeutically important human CDKs. 1 and 2 exhibit a remarkable mechanism, forming\na site-selective covalent bond to the CDK active site Lys. We explored\nthe structure\u2013activity relationship via semi- and total synthesis,\ngenerating an analog, 43, with improved kinase selectivity,\nbioavailability, and efficacy. This work highlights the power of TD3 to identify mechanistically and structurally novel molecules\nfor the development of new medicines."]
