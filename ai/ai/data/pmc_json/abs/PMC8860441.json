["Stable adherence to epithelial surfaces is required for colonization by diverse host-associated microbes. Successful attachment of pathogenic microbes to host cells via adhesin molecules is also the first step in many devastating infections. Despite the primacy of epithelial adherence in establishing host-microbe associations, the evolutionary processes that shape this crucial interface remain enigmatic. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) encompass a multifunctional family of vertebrate cell surface proteins which are recurrent targets of bacterial adhesins at epithelial barriers. Here, we show that multiple members of the primate CEACAM family exhibit evidence of repeated natural selection at protein surfaces targeted by bacteria, consistent with pathogen-driven evolution. Divergence of CEACAM proteins between even closely related great apes is sufficient to control molecular interactions with a range of bacterial adhesins. Phylogenetic analyses further reveal that repeated gene conversion of CEACAM extracellular domains during primate divergence plays a key role in limiting bacterial adhesin host tropism. Moreover, we demonstrate that gene conversion has continued to shape CEACAM diversity within human populations, with abundant human CEACAM1 variants mediating evasion of adhesins from pathogenic Neisseria. Together this work reveals a mechanism by which gene conversion shapes first contact between microbes and animal hosts.", "eLife digest", "Trillions of bacteria live in and on the human body. Most of them are harmless but some can cause serious infections. To grow in or on the body, bacteria often attach to proteins on the surface of cells that make up the lining of tissues like the gut or the throat. In some cases, bacteria use these proteins to invade the cells causing an infection. Genetic mutations in the genes encoding these proteins that protect against infection are more likely to be passed on to future generations. This may lead to rapid spread of these beneficial genes in a population.", "A family of proteins called CEACAMs are frequent targets of infection-causing bacteria. These proteins have been shown to play a role in cancer progression. But they also play many helpful roles in the body, including helping transmit messages between cells, aiding cell growth, and helping the immune system recognize pathogens. Scientists are not sure if these multi-tasking CEACAM proteins can evolve to evade bacteria without affecting their other roles.", "Baker et al. show that CEACAM proteins targeted by bacteria have undergone rapid evolution in primates. In the experiments, human genes encoding CEACAMs were compared with equivalent genes from 19 different primates. Baker et al. found the changes in human and primate CEACAMs often occur through a process called gene conversion. Gene conversion occurs when DNA sections are copied and pasted from one gene to another. Using laboratory experiments, they showed that some of these changes enabled CEACAM proteins to prevent certain harmful bacteria from binding.", "The experiments suggest that some versions of CEACAM genes may protect humans or other primates against bacterial infections. Studies in natural populations are needed to test if this is the case. Learning more about how CEACAM proteins evolve and what they do may help scientists better understand the role they play in cancer and help improve cancer care. Studying CEACAM evolution may also help scientists understand how bacteria and other pathogens drive protein evolution in the body."]
