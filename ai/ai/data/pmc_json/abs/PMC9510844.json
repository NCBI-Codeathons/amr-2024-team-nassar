["The human microbiota produces molecules that are evolved to interact with the diverse cellular machinery of both the host and microbes, mediating health and diseases. One of the most puzzling microbiome molecules is colibactin, a genotoxin encoded in some commensal and extraintestinal microbes and is implicated in initiating colorectal cancer. The colibactin cluster was discovered more than 15\u00a0years ago, and most of the research studies have been focused on revealing the biosynthesis and precise structure of the cryptic encoded molecule(s) and the mechanism of carcinogenesis. In 2022, the Balskus group revealed that colibactin not only hits targets in the eukaryotic cell machinery but also in the prokaryotic cell. To that end, colibactin crosslinks the DNA resulting in activation of the SOS signaling pathway, leading to prophage induction from bacterial lysogens and modulation of virulence genes in pathogenic species. These unique activities of colibactin highlight its ecological role in shaping gut microbial communities and further consequences that impact human health. This review dives in-depth into the molecular mechanisms underpinning colibactin cellular targets in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, aiming to understand the fine details of the role of secreted microbiome chemistry in mediating host\u2013microbe and microbe\u2013microbe interactions. This understanding translates into a better realization of microbiome potential and how this could be advanced to future microbiome-based therapeutics or diagnostic biomarkers."]
