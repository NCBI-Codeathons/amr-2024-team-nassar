["Summary", "Actinomycetota (Actinobacteria) is an ecologically and industrially important phylum which is challenging to extract pure high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA from. This protocol provides a parallelized, cost-effective, and straightforward approach for consistently extracting pure HMW DNA using modified non-toxic commercial kits suitable for higher throughput applications. We further provide a workflow for sequencing and assembly of complete genomes using an optimized Oxford Nanopore rapid barcoding protocol and Illumina data error correction.", "Graphical abstract", "", "Highlights", "\u2022Extraction and purification of HMW DNA in filamentous Actinobacteria\u2022A cost-effective parallelized approach for handling heterogeneous samples\u2022Dual parallel sequencing using Nanopore and Illumina platforms\u2022Assembly of high-quality whole genomes de novo", "Extraction and purification of HMW DNA in filamentous Actinobacteria", "A cost-effective parallelized approach for handling heterogeneous samples", "Dual parallel sequencing using Nanopore and Illumina platforms", "Assembly of high-quality whole genomes de novo", "Publisher\u2019s note: Undertaking any experimental protocol requires adherence to local institutional guidelines for laboratory safety and ethics.", "Actinomycetota (Actinobacteria) is an ecologically and industrially important phylum which are challenging to extract pure high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA from.
