["Several nucleoside antibiotics are structurally characterized by a 5\u2032\u2032-amino-5\u2032\u2032-deoxyribose (ADR) appended via a glycosidic bond to a high-carbon sugar nucleoside, (5\u2032S,6\u2032S)-5\u2032-C-glycyluridine (GlyU). GlyU is further modified with an N-alkylamine linker, the biosynthetic origins of which have yet to be established. By using a combination of feeding experiments with isotopically labeled precursors and characterization of recombinant proteins from multiple pathways, the biosynthetic mechanism for N-alkylamine installation for ADR-GlyU-containing nucleoside antibiotics has been uncovered. The data reveal S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) as the direct precursor of the N-alkylamine, but unlike conventional AdoMet- or decarboxylated AdoMet-dependent alkyltransferases, the reaction is catalyzed by a pyridoxal-5\u2032-phophosate (PLP)-dependent aminobutyryltransferase (ABTase) using a stepwise \u03b3-replacement mechanism that couples \u03b3-elimination of AdoMet with aza-\u03b3-addition onto the disaccharide alkyl acceptor. In addition to utilizing a conceptually different strategy for AdoMet-dependent alkylation, the newly discovered ABTases require a phosphorylated disaccharide alkyl acceptor, revealing a cryptic intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway."]
