["Emerging evidence suggests the promise of the use of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in inflammatory disorders based on their unique immune-intervention properties. However, the roles of MDSCs in autoimmune arthritis are not completely understood. Indeed, their immunosuppressive functions in arthritic conditions remain controversial, with heterogeneity among MDSCs and differential effects among subpopulations receiving much attention. As a result, it is necessary to determine the roles of MDSC subpopulations in autoimmune arthritis to clarify their diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Interestingly, in the inflammation niche of autoimmune arthritis, each MDSC subpopulation can exhibit both alternatives of a given characteristic. Moreover, polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) are likely to be more suppressive and stable compared with monocytic MDSCs (MO-MDSCs). Although various important cytokines associated with the differentiation of MDSCs or MDSC subpopulations from immature myeloid precursors, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), have been largely applied in external inductive systems, their roles are not entirely clear. Moreover, MDSC-based clinical treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) continue to represent a significant challenge, as also reported for other autoimmune diseases. In this review, we describe the effects and actions of MDSC subpopulations on the development of autoimmune arthritis and analyze several types of MDSC-based therapeutic strategies to provide comprehensive information regarding immune networks and a foundation for more effective protocols for autoimmune arthritis."]
