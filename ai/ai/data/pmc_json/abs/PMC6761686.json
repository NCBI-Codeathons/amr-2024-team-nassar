["", "Over\nthe past 30 years, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of\ninfections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which have proliferated\ndue to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Over this same time\nperiod, however, there has also been a decline in the number of antibiotics\nwith novel mechanisms of action coming to market. Therefore, there\nis a growing need for an increase in the speed at which new antibiotics\nare discovered and developed. Natural products produced by bacteria\nhave been and continue to be a robust source of novel antibiotics;\nhowever, new and complementary methods for screening large bacterial\nlibraries for novel antibiotic production are needed due to the current\nagar methods being limited in scope, time consuming, and prone to\nerror. Herein, we describe a rapid, robust, and quantitative high-throughput\nliquid culture screening method for antibiotic production by bacteria.\nThis method has the ability to screen both mono- and coculture mixtures\nof bacteria in vitro and be adapted to other phenotypic\nnatural product analyses. Over 260 bacterial species were screened\nin monoculture, and 38 and 34% were found to produce antibiotics capable\nof inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli, respectively,\nwith 8 and 4% being classified as strong producers (\u226530% growth\ninhibition), respectively. Bacteria found to not produce antibiotics\nin monoculture were also screened in coculture using an adaptation\nof this method. Of the more than 270 cocultures screened, 14 and 30%\nwere found to produce antibiotics capable of inhibition of S. aureus or E. coli, respectively. Of those bacteria found to produce antibiotics in\nmonoculture, 43 bacteria were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and\nfound to be majority Pseudomonas (37%), Serratia (19%), and Bacillus (14%) bacteria, but two novel\nproducers, Herbaspirillum and Kluyvera, were also found."]
