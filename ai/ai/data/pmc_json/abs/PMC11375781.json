["", "Berberine bridge\nenzyme-like oxidases are often involved in natural\nproduct biosynthesis and are seen as essential enzymes for the generation\nof intricate pharmacophores. These oxidases have the ability to transfer\na hydride atom to the FAD cofactor, which enables complex substrate\nmodifications and rearrangements including (intramolecular) cyclizations,\ncarbon\u2013carbon bond formations, and nucleophilic additions.\nDespite the diverse range of activities, the mechanistic details of\nthese reactions often remain incompletely understood. In this Review,\nwe delve into the complexity that BBE-like oxidases from bacteria,\nfungal, and plant origins exhibit by providing an overview of the\nshared catalytic features and emphasizing the different reactivities.\nWe propose four generalized modes of action by which BBE-like oxidases\nenable the synthesis of natural products, ranging from the classic\nalcohol oxidation reactions to less common amine and amide oxidation\nreactions. Exploring the mechanisms utilized by nature to produce\nits vast array of natural products is a subject of considerable interest\nand can lead to the discovery of unique biochemical activities."]
