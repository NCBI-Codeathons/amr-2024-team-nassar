["Background", "Antitumor compounds PM100117 and PM100118 are glycosylated polyketides derived from the marine actinobacteria Streptomyces caniferus GUA-06-05-006A. The organization and characterization of the PM100117/18 biosynthesis gene cluster has been recently reported.", "Results", "Based on the preceding information and new genetic engineering data, we have outlined the pathway by which PM100117/18 are glycosylated. Furthermore, these genetic engineering experiments have allowed the generation of novel PM100117/18 analogues. Deletion of putative glycosyltranferase genes and additional genes presumably involved in late biosynthesis steps of the three 2,6-dideoxysugars appended to the PM100117/18 polyketide skeleton, resulted in the generation of a series of intermediates and novel derivatives.", "Conclusions", "Isolation and identification of the novel compounds constitutes an important contribution to our knowledge on PM100117/18 glycosylation, and set the basis for further characterization of specific enzymatic reactions, additional genetic engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis approaches.", "Electronic supplementary material", "The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12934-016-0591-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."]
