["A diverse and versatile spectrum of metabolic activities among isolates of fluorescent Pseudomonas putida indicates their adaptability to various niches. These polyhydroxybutyrate producing and phosphate solubilizing isolates showed a high level of functional and genetic versatility among themselves. One of the potential P. putida isolate P132 can contribute as a candidate agent for both biocontrol and PGPR applications. Identified as one of the most efficient PHB producer and phosphate solubilizer, in vitro detection of P132 showed the presence of genes for phenazine, pyrrolnitrin, pyoluteorin and 2,4 diacetylphloroglucinol along with polyhydroxyalkanoate."]
