["Background", "Anthraquinone-fused enediynes (AFEs) are excellent payloads for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The yields of AFEs in the original bacterial hosts are extremely low. Multiple traditional methods had been adopted to enhance the production of the AFEs. Despite these efforts, the production titers of these compounds are still low, presenting a practical challenge for their development. Tiancimycins (TNMs) are a class of AFEs produced by Streptomyces sp. CB03234. One of their salient features is that they exhibit rapid and complete cell killing ability against various cancer cell lines.", "Results", "In this study, a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy guided by the CB03234-S genome and transcriptome was employed to improve the titers of TNMs. First, re-sequencing of CB03234-S (Ribosome engineered mutant strains) genome revealed the deletion of a 583-kb DNA fragment, accounting for about 7.5% of its genome. Second, by individual or combined inactivation of seven potential precursor competitive biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in CB03234-S, a double-BGC inactivation mutant, S1009, was identified with an improved TNMs titer of 28.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00a0mg/L. Third, overexpression of five essential biosynthetic genes, including two post-modification genes, and three self-resistance auxiliary genes, was also conducted, through which we discovered that mutants carrying the core genes, tnmE or tnmE10, exhibited enhanced TNMs production. The average TNMs yield reached 43.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4\u00a0mg/L in a 30-L fermenter, representing an approximately 360% increase over CB03234-S and the highest titer among all AFEs to date. Moreover, the resulting mutant produced TNM-W, a unique TNM derivative with a double bond instead of a common ethylene oxide moiety. Preliminary studies suggested that TNM-W was probably converted from TNM-A by both TnmE and TnmE10.", "Conclusions", "Based on the genome and transcriptome analyses, we adopted a combined metabolic engineering strategy for precursor enrichment and biosynthetic pathway reorganization to construct a high-yield strain of TNMs based on CB03234-S. Our study establishes a solid basis for the clinical development of AFE-based ADCs.", "Supplementary Information", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12934-024-02399-w."]
