["Abstract", "Thiolutin is a natural product transcription inhibitor with an unresolved mode of action. Thiolutin and the related dithiolopyrrolone holomycin chelate Zn2+ and previous studies have concluded that RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) inhibition in vivo is indirect. Here, we present chemicogenetic and biochemical approaches to investigate thiolutin's mode of action in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identify mutants that alter sensitivity to thiolutin. We provide genetic evidence that thiolutin causes oxidation of thioredoxins in vivo and that thiolutin both induces oxidative stress and interacts functionally with multiple metals including Mn2+ and Cu2+, and not just Zn2+. Finally, we show direct inhibition of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription initiation by thiolutin in vitro in support of classical studies that thiolutin can directly inhibit transcription in vitro. Inhibition requires both Mn2+ and appropriate reduction of thiolutin as excess DTT abrogates its effects. Pause prone, defective elongation can be observed in vitro if inhibition is bypassed. Thiolutin effects on Pol II occupancy in vivo are widespread but major effects are consistent with prior observations for Tor pathway inhibition and stress induction, suggesting that thiolutin use in vivo should be restricted to studies on its modes of action and not as an experimental tool.", "Graphical Abstract", "Graphical Abstract", "Graphical Abstract"]
