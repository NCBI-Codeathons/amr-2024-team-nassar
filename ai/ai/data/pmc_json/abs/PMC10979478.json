["", "Myxobacteria are\na prolific source of secondary metabolites with\nsheer chemical complexity, intriguing biosynthetic enzymology, and\ndiverse biological activities. In this study, we report the discovery,\nbiosynthesis, biomimetic total synthesis, physiological function,\nstructure\u2013activity relationship, and self-resistance mechanism\nof the 5-methylated pyrazinone coralinone from a myxobacterium Corallococcus exiguus SDU70. A single NRPS/PKS gene corA was genetically and biochemically demonstrated to orchestrate\ncoralinone, wherein the integral PKS part is responsible for installing\nthe 5-methyl group. Intriguingly, coralinone exacerbated cellular\naggregation of myxobacteria grown in liquid cultures by enhancing\nthe secretion of extracellular matrix, and the 5-methylation is indispensable\nfor the alleged activity. We provided an evolutionary landscape of\nthe corA-associated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)\ndistributed in the myxobacterial realm, revealing the divergent evolution\nfor the diversity-oriented biosynthesis of 5-alkyated pyrazinones.\nThis phylogenetic contextualization provoked us to identify corB located in the proximity of corA as\na self-resistance gene. CorB was experimentally verified to be a protease\nthat hydrolyzes extracellular proteins to antagonize the agglutination-inducing\neffect of coralinone. Overall, we anticipate these findings will provide\nnew insights into the chemical ecology of myxobacteria and lay foundations\nfor the maximal excavation of these largely underexplored resources.", "corA autonomously codes\nfor 5-methylated\npyrazinone that promotes secretion of extracellular matrix to induce\nagglutination of myxobacteria, and corB encoding\na protease is the self-resistance gene."]
