["Summary", "Microbisporicin is a potent type I lantibiotic produced by the rare actinomycete M\nicrobispora corallina that is in preclinical trials for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin\u2010resistant isolates of S\ntaphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Analysis of the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of microbisporicin, which contains two unique post\u2010translationally modified residues (5\u2010chlorotryptophan and 3, 4\u2010dihydroxyproline), has revealed an unusual regulatory mechanism that involves a pathway\u2010specific extracytoplasmic function sigma factor (MibX)/anti\u2010sigma factor (MibW) complex and an additional transcriptional regulator MibR. A model for the regulation of microbisporicin biosynthesis derived from transcriptional, mutational and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses suggests that MibR, which contains a C\u2010terminal DNA\u2010binding domain found in the LuxR family of transcriptional activators, functions as an essential master regulator to trigger microbisporicin production while MibX and MibW induce feed\u2010forward biosynthesis and producer immunity. Moreover, we demonstrate that initial expression of mib\nR, and thus microbisporicin production, is dependent on the ppGpp synthetase gene (relA) of M\n.\u2009corallina. In addition, we show that constitutive expression of either of the two positively acting regulatory genes, mib\nR or mib\nX, leads to precocious and enhanced microbisporicin production."]
