["This study reports the complete genome sequence of Subtercola sp. PAMC28395, a strain isolated from cryoconite in Uganda. This strain possesses several active carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes involved in glycogen and trehalose metabolism. Additionally, two specific genes associated with \u03b1-galactosidase (GH36) and bacterial alpha-1,2-mannosidase (GH92) were identified in this strain. The presence of these genes indicates the likelihood that they can be expressed, enabling the strain to break down specific polysaccharides derived from plants or the shells of nearby crabs. The authors performed a comparative analysis of CAZyme patterns and biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in several Subtercola strains and provided annotations describing the unique characteristics of these strains. The comparative analysis of BGCs revealed that four strains, including PAMC28395, have oligosaccharide BGCs, and we confirmed that the pentose phosphate pathway was configured perfectly in the genome of PAMC28395, which may be associated with adaptation to low temperatures. Additionally, all strains contained antibiotic resistance genes, indicating a complex self-resistance system. These results suggest that PAMC28395 can adapt quickly to the cold environment and produce energy autonomously. This study provides valuable information on novel functional enzymes, particularly CAZymes, that operate at low temperatures and can be used for biotechnological applications and fundamental research purposes."]
