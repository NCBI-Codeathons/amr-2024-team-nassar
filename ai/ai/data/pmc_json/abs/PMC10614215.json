["Significance", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes biofilm-based infections and is known for its production of colorful phenazine derivatives. Among these, the methylated phenazines are the most toxic and can cause condition-dependent damage to their producer. Here, we show that the methylated phenazine pyocyanin also has a beneficial effect in that it supports metabolic activity at depth in biofilms, where oxygen limitation would otherwise stall metabolism. We describe a link between P. aeruginosa global regulators, which control methylated phenazine production in a manner that limits the toxicity of these compounds while simultaneously enabling their contribution to metabolism. These results expand our understanding of the strategies that enable P. aeruginosa survival in multicellular structures, which is key to its success during chronic host colonization.", "Within biofilms, gradients of electron acceptors such as oxygen stimulate the formation of physiological subpopulations. This heterogeneity can enable cross-feeding and promote drug resilience, features of the multicellular lifestyle that make biofilm-based infections difficult to treat. The pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces pigments called phenazines that can support metabolic activity in hypoxic/anoxic biofilm subzones, but these compounds also include methylated derivatives that are toxic to their producer under some conditions. In this study, we uncover roles for the global regulators RpoS and Hfq/Crc in controlling the beneficial and detrimental effects of methylated phenazines in biofilms. Our results indicate that RpoS controls phenazine methylation by modulating activity of the carbon catabolite repression pathway, in which the Hfq/Crc complex inhibits translation of the phenazine methyltransferase PhzM. We find that RpoS indirectly inhibits expression of CrcZ, a small RNA that binds to and sequesters Hfq/Crc, specifically in the oxic subzone of P. aeruginosa biofilms. Deletion of rpoS or crc therefore leads to overproduction of methylated phenazines, which we show leads to increased metabolic activity\u2014an apparent beneficial effect\u2014in hypoxic/anoxic subpopulations within biofilms. However, we also find that under specific conditions, biofilms lacking RpoS and/or Crc show increased sensitivity to phenazines indicating that the increased metabolic activity in these mutants comes at a cost. Together, these results suggest that complex regulation of PhzM allows P. aeruginosa to simultaneously exploit the benefits and limit the toxic effects of methylated phenazines."]
