["", "Pedobacter cryoconitis strain UP508 was isolated\nfrom a soil sample using a mixture of ampicillin, kanamycin, and nalidixic\nacid for selection. UP508 was found to produce >30 unknown antibacterial\npeptides, of which eight, isopedopeptins A\u2013H (1\u20138), were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation\nand characterized with respect to structures and biological properties.\nCompounds 1\u20138 were all composed of\nnine amino acid residues and one 3-hydroxy fatty acid residue, and\nthe structures were ring-closed via an ester bond from the C-terminal\naspartic acid to the 3-hydroxy fatty acid. The differences between\nthe peptides were the size and branching of the 3-hydroxy fatty acid\nand the presence of a valine or a 3-hydroxyvaline residue. The isopedopeptins\nmainly had activity against Gram-negative bacteria, and isopedopeptin\nB (2), which had the best combination of antibacterial\nactivity, in vitro cytotoxicity, and hemolytic properties,\nwas selected for further studies against a larger panel of Gram-negative\nbacteria. Isopedopeptin B was found to have good activity against\nstrains of WHO top-priority Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimal inhibitory\nconcentrations (MIC) down to 1, 2, and 4 \u03bcg/mL, respectively.\nFurthermore, compound 2 had activity against colistin-resistant\nstrains of A. baumannii, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with a MIC down to\n8, 2, and 4 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Compound 6 was\ntested in an E. coli liposome system where it induced\nsignificant leakage, indicating membrane disruption as one mechanism\ninvolved in isopedopeptin antibacterial activity. Isopedopeptin B\nstands out as a promising candidate for further studies with the goal\nto develop a new antibiotic drug."]
