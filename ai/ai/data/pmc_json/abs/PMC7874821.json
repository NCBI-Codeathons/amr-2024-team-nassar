["Abstract", "A random transposition mutant library of B. gladioli UAPS07070 was analyzed for searching mutants with impaired microbial antagonism. Three derivates showed diminished antimicrobial activity against a sensitive strain. The mutated loci showed high similarity to the quorum sensing genes of the AHL-synthase and its regulator. Another mutant was affected in a gene coding for a LysrR-type transcriptional regulator. The production of toxoflavin, the most well known antimicrobial-molecule and a major virulence factor of plant-pathogenic B. glumae and B. gladioli was explored. The absence of a yellowish pigment related to toxoflavin and the undetectable transcription of toxA in the mutants indicated the participation of the QS system and of the LysR-type transcriptional regulator in the regulation of toxoflavin. Additionally, those genes were found to be related to the swarming phenotype. Lettuce inoculated with the AHL synthase and the lysR mutants showed less severe symptoms. We present evidence of the participation of both, the quorum sensing and for the first time, of a LysR-type transcriptional regulator in antibiosis and swarming phenotype in a strain of B. gladioli"]
