["This paper summarizes information about the division of bacteriocins into classes (Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and archaea). Methods for producing bacteriocins have been studied. It is known that bacteriocins, most successfully used today are products of secondary metabolism of lactic acid bacteria. It is established that the main method of bacteriocin research is PCR analysis, which makes it possible to quickly and easily identify the presence of bacteriocin encoding genes. The mechanism of cytotoxic action of bacteriocins has been studied. It is proved that the study of cytotoxic (antitumor) activity in laboratory conditions will lead to the clinical use of bacteriocins for cancer treatment in the near future. It is established that the incorporation of bacteriocins into nanoparticles and targeted delivery to areas of infection may soon become an effective treatment method. The delivery of bacteriocins in a concentrated form, such as encapsulated in nanoparticles, will increase their effectiveness and minimize potential toxic side effects. The analysis of publications on this topic confirmed that diverse research on bacteriocins is relevant."]
