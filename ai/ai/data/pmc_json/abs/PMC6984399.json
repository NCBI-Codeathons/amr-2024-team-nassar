["Summary", "In agricultural production, sustainability is currently one of the most significant concerns. The genetic modification of plant growth\u2010promoting rhizobacteria may provide a novel way to use natural bacteria as microbial inoculants. In this study, the root\u2010colonizing strain Pseudomonas protegens Pf\u20105 was genetically modified to act as a biocontrol agent and biofertilizer with biological nitrogen fixation activity. Genetic inactivation of retS enhanced the production of 2,4\u2010diacetylphloroglucinol, which contributed for the enhanced antifungal activity. Then, the entire nitrogenase island with native promoter from Pseudomonas stutzeri \nDSM4166 was introduced into a retS mutant strain for expression. Root colonization patterns assessed via confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that GFP\u2010tagged bacterial were mainly located on root surfaces and at the junctions between epidermal root cells. Moreover, under pathogen and N\u2010limited double treatment conditions, the fresh weights of seedlings inoculated with the recombinant retS mutant\u2010nif strain were increased compared with those of the control. In conclusion, this study has innovatively developed an eco\u2010friendly alternative to the agrochemicals that will benefit global plant production significantly.", "In this study, the root\u2010colonizing strain Pseudomonas protegens Pf\u20105 was genetically modified to act as a biocontrol agent and biofertilizer with biological nitrogen fixation activity.
