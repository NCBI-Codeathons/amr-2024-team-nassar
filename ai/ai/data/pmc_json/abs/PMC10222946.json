["Substantial progress has been achieved and knowledge gaps addressed in synthetic biology-mediated engineering of biological organisms to produce high-value metabolites. Bio-based products from fungi are extensively explored in the present era, attributed to their emerging importance in the industrial sector, healthcare, and food applications. The edible group of fungi and multiple fungal strains defines attractive biological resources for high-value metabolites comprising food additives, pigments, dyes, industrial chemicals, and antibiotics, including other compounds. In this direction, synthetic biology-mediated genetic chassis of fungal strains to enhance/add value to novel chemical entities of biological origin is opening new avenues in fungal biotechnology. While substantial success has been achieved in the genetic manipulation of economically viable fungi (including Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in the production of metabolites of socio-economic relevance, knowledge gaps/obstacles in fungal biology and engineering need to be remedied for complete exploitation of valuable fungal strains. Herein, the thematic article discusses the novel attributes of bio-based products from fungi and the creation of high-value engineered fungal strains to promote yield, bio-functionality, and value-addition of the metabolites of socio-economic value. Efforts have been made to discuss the existing limitations in fungal chassis and how the advances in synthetic biology provide a plausible solution."]
