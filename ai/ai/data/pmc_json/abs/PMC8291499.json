["", "Glycopeptide antibiotics\n(GPAs) are last defense line drugs against\nmultidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Natural GPAs teicoplanin\nand vancomycin, as well as semisynthetic oritavancin, telavancin,\nand dalbavancin, are currently approved for clinical use. Although\nthese antibiotics remain efficient, emergence of novel GPA-resistant\npathogens is a question of time. Therefore, it is important to investigate\nthe natural variety of GPAs coming from so-called \u201crare\u201d\nactinobacteria. Herein we describe a novel GPA producer\u2014Nonomuraea coxensis DSM 45129. Its de novo sequenced and completely assembled genome harbors a biosynthetic\ngene cluster (BGC) similar to the dbv BGC of A40926,\nthe natural precursor to dalbavancin. The strain produces a novel\nGPA, which we propose is an A40926 analogue lacking the carboxyl group\non the N-acylglucosamine moiety. This structural\ndifference correlates with the absence of dbv29\u2014coding\nfor an enzyme responsible for the oxidation of the N-acylglucosamine moiety. Introduction of dbv29 into N. coxensis led to A40926 production in this strain.\nFinally, we successfully applied dbv3 and dbv4 heterologous transcriptional regulators to trigger\nand improve A50926 production in N. coxensis, making them prospective tools for screening other Nonomuraea spp. for GPA production. Our work highlights\ngenus Nonomuraea as a still untapped\nsource of novel GPAs."]
