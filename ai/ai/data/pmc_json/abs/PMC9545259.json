["Abstract", "Understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms is central to the development of anti\u2010infective therapies and genomics\u2010based drug discovery. Yet, many knowledge gaps remain regarding the resistance strategies employed against novel types of antibiotics from less\u2010explored producers such as anaerobic bacteria, among them the Clostridia. Through the use of genome editing and functional assays, we found that CtaZ confers self\u2010resistance against the copper chelator and gyrase inhibitor closthioamide (CTA) in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Bioinformatics, biochemical analyses, and X\u2010ray crystallography revealed CtaZ as a founding member of a new group of GyrI\u2010like proteins. CtaZ is unique in binding a polythioamide scaffold in a ligand\u2010optimized hydrophobic pocket, thereby confining CTA. By genome mining using CtaZ as a handle, we discovered previously overlooked homologs encoded by diverse members of the phylum Firmicutes, including many pathogens. In addition to characterizing both a new role for a GyrI\u2010like domain in self\u2010resistance and unprecedented thioamide binding, this work aids in uncovering related drug\u2010resistance mechanisms.", "A central contributor to the self\u2010resistance of an anaerobic antibiotic producer is identified. CtaZ, a new member of the GyrI\u2010like superfamily, confines the gyrase inhibitor closthioamide in a ligand\u2010optimized pocket. Genome mining uncovered CtaZ homologs encoded in the genomes of diverse bacteria, including numerous pathogens."]
