["With the invasion of green tides and the increase of urban green areas worldwide, multimillion tons of Enteromorpha need to be reutilized. In this study, Enteromorpha prolifera powder is considered a promising biomass resource for the production of commercial chemical products production. Ilamycins, novel cyclic heptapeptides with significant anti-TB activities, are isolated from Streptomyces atratus SCSIO ZH16, a deep-sea-derived strain. Using EP powder as a nitrogen source, the production of ilamycins reached 709.97\u00a0mg/L through optimization of the nitrogen source using the engineered strain S. atratus SCSIO ZH16 \u0394R. After mutant strain constructions and tests, strain S. atratus SCSIO ZH16 \u0394R::bldD EP powder achieved a higher production titer of ilamycins. Furthermore, the production titer of ilamycins and ilamycin E reached 1561.77\u00a0mg/L and 745.44\u00a0mg/L, respectively, in a 5\u00a0L bioreactor. This study suggests that E. prolifera is a promising and eco-friendly nitrogen source for the production of ilamycins.", "Supplementary Information", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13068-023-02398-w."]
