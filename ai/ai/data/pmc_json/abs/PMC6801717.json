["Corynespora leaf spot caused by Corynespora cassiicola is one of the major diseases in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). However, the resistance mechanisms and signals of cucumber to C. cassiicola are unclear. Here, we report that the mildew resistance locus O (MLO) genes, CsMLO1 and CsMLO2, are both negative modulators of the cucumber defense response to C. cassiicola. Subcellular localization analysis showed that CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 are localized in the plasma membrane. Expression analysis indicated that the transcript levels of CsMLO1 and CsMLO2 are linked to the defense response to C. cassiicola. Transient overexpression of either CsMLO1 or CsMLO2 in cucumber cotyledons reduced resistance to C. cassiicola, whereas silencing of either CsMLO1 or CsMLO2 enhanced resistance to C. cassiicola. The relationships of pathogenesis-related proteins, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated genes, and abscisic acid (ABA)-related genes to the overexpression and silencing of CsMLO1/CsMLO2 in non-infested cucumber plants were investigated. The results indicated that CsMLO1 mediated resistance against C. cassiicola by regulating the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins and ROS-associated genes, as well as through ABA signaling pathway-associated genes. The CsMLO2-mediated resistance against C. cassiicola primarily involves regulation of the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins. Our findings will guide strategies to enhance the resistance of cucumber to corynespora leaf spot."]
