["", "Synthetic\nbiology offers a new path for the exploitation and improvement\nof natural products to address the growing crisis in antibiotic resistance.\nAll antibiotics in clinical use are facing eventual obsolesce as a\nresult of the evolution and dissemination of resistance mechanisms,\nyet there are few new drug leads forthcoming from the pharmaceutical\nsector. Natural products of microbial origin have proven over the\npast 70 years to be the wellspring of antimicrobial drugs. Harnessing\nsynthetic biology thinking and strategies can provide new molecules\nand expand chemical diversity of known antibiotic scaffolds to provide\nmuch needed new drug leads. The glycopeptide antibiotics offer paradigmatic\nscaffolds suitable for such an approach. We review these strategies\nhere using the glycopeptides as an example and demonstrate how synthetic\nbiology can expand antibiotic chemical diversity to help address the\ngrowing resistance crisis."]
