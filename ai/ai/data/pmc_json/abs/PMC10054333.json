["Aclacinomycin A (ACM-A) is an anthracycline antitumor agent widely used in clinical practice. The current industrial production of ACM-A relies primarily on chemical synthesis and microbial fermentation. However, chemical synthesis involves multiple reactions which give rise to high production costs and environmental pollution. Microbial fermentation is a sustainable strategy, yet the current fermentation yield is too low to satisfy market demand. Hence, strain improvement is highly desirable, and tremendous endeavors have been made to decipher biosynthesis pathways and modify key enzymes. In this review, we comprehensively describe the reported biosynthesis pathways, key enzymes, and, especially, catalytic mechanisms. In addition, we come up with strategies to uncover unknown enzymes and improve the activities of rate-limiting enzymes. Overall, this review aims to provide valuable insights for complete biosynthesis of ACM-A."]
