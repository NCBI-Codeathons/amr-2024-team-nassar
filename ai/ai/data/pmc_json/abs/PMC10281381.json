["Abstract", "Antimicrobial resistance is a major obstacle for the treatment of infectious diseases and currently represents one of the most significant threats to global health. Staphylococcus aureus remains a formidable human pathogen with high mortality rates associated with severe systemic infections. S. aureus has become notorious as a multidrug resistant bacterium, which when combined with its extensive arsenal of virulence factors that exacerbate disease, culminates in an incredibly challenging pathogen to treat clinically. Compounding this major health issue is the lack of antibiotic discovery and development, with only two new classes of antibiotics approved for clinical use in the last 20\u2009years. Combined efforts from the scientific community have reacted to the threat of dwindling treatment options to combat S. aureus disease in several innovative and exciting developments. This review describes current and future antimicrobial strategies aimed at treating staphylococcal colonization and/or disease, examining therapies that show significant promise at the preclinical development stage to approaches that are currently being investigated in clinical trials.", "Summary of novel strategies currently being developed to treat multi\u2010drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections."]
