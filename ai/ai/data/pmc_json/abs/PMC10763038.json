["Background", "Antibiotics biosynthesis is usually regulated by the cluster-situated regulatory gene(s) (CSRG(s)), which directly regulate the genes within the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). Previously, we have demonstrated that LmbU functions as a cluster-situated regulator (CSR) of lincomycin. And it has been found that LmbU regulates twenty non-lmb genes through comparative transcriptomic analysis. However, the regulatory mode of CSRs\u2019 targets outside the BGC remains unknown.", "Results", "We screened the targets of LmbU in the whole genome of Streptomyces lincolnensis and found fourteen candidate targets, among which, eight targets can bind to LmbU by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Reporter assays in vivo revealed that LmbU repressed the transcription of SLINC_0469 and SLINC_1037 while activating the transcription of SLINC_8097. In addition, disruptions of SLINC_0469, SLINC_1037, and SLINC_8097 promoted the production of lincomycin, and qRT-PCR showed that SLINC_0469, SLINC_1037, and SLINC_8097 inhibited transcription of the lmb genes, indicating that all the three regulators can negatively regulate lincomycin biosynthesis.", "Conclusions", "LmbU can directly regulate genes outside the lmb cluster, and these genes can affect both lincomycin biosynthesis and the transcription of lmb genes. Our results first erected the cascade regulatory circuit of LmbU and regulators outside lmb cluster, which provides the theoretical basis for the functional research of LmbU family proteins.", "Supplementary Information", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12934-023-02284-y."]
