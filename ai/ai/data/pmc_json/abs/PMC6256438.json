["Bacillus sp. strain ISO11, a Bacillus cereus clade member isolated from the intestinal tract of Fundulus heteroclitus, possesses potential probiotic and antibacterial activity against Vibrio sp.", "ABSTRACT", "Bacillus sp. strain ISO11, a Bacillus cereus clade member isolated from the intestinal tract of Fundulus heteroclitus, possesses potential probiotic and antibacterial activity against Vibrio sp. pathogens. Antibacterial activity is likely due to production of microcin and a zwittermicin A-like aminopolyol. The genome sequence will assist in identifying additional related processes."]
