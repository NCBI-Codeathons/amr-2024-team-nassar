["", "This review focuses entirely on the\nnatural bengamides and selected\nsynthetic analogues that have inspired decades of research. Bengamide\nA was first reported in 1986 from the sponge Jaspis cf. coriacea, and bengamide-containing sponges\nhave been gathered from many biogeographic sites. In 2005, a terrestrial\nGram-negative bacterium, Myxococcus virescens, was\nadded as a source for bengamides. Biological activity data using varying\nbengamide-based scaffolds has enabled fine-tuning of structure\u2013activity\nrelationships. Molecular target finding contributed to the creation\nof a synthetic \u201clead\u201d compound, LAF389, that was the\nsubject of a phase I anticancer clinical trial. Despite clinical trial\ntermination, the bengamide compound class is still attracting worldwide\nattention. Future breakthroughs based on the bengamide scaffold are\npossible and could build on their nanomolar in vitro and positive\nin vivo antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties. Bengamide\nmolecular targets include methionine aminopeptidases (MetAP1 and MetAP2)\nand nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells\n(NF-\u03baB). A mixed PKS/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster appears\nto be responsible for creation of the bengamides. This review highlights\nthat the bengamides have driven inspirational studies and that they\nwill remain relevant for future research, even 30 years after the\ndiscovery of the first structures."]
