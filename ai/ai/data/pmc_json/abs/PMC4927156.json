["Fighting antibiotic resistance requires a deeper understanding of the genetic factors that determine the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria. Here we describe a chemical-genomic screen in Escherichia coli K-12 that was designed to discover new aspects of antibiotic resistance by focusing on a set of 26 antibiotics and other stresses with poorly characterized mode-of-action and determinants of resistance. We show that the screen identifies new resistance determinants for these antibiotics including a common signature from two antimicrobials, kasugamycin and blasticidin S, used to treat crop diseases like rice blast and fire blight. Following this signature, we further investigated the mechanistic basis for susceptibility to kasugamycin and blasticidin S in E. coli using both genetic and biochemical approaches. We provide evidence that these compounds hijack an overlapping set of peptide ABC-importers to enter the bacterial cell. Loss of uptake may be an underappreciated mechanism for the development of kasugamycin resistance in bacterial plant pathogens.", "Author Summary", "Bacterial species differ in their susceptibility to antibiotics but the reason for these differences remains an open question. Understanding the genetic basis of antibiotic susceptibility will be critical for predicting the efficacy of new antibiotics and possibly finding new antibiotic targets. Here we report a large-scale study that connects bacterial genes to antibiotics, using a set of antibiotics that were chosen to include poorly characterized compounds. We discovered genes that confer resistance to a number of neglected antibiotics, expanding our knowledge of gene function and antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli K-12. Starting from this large-scale screen, we then investigated how two antibiotics with a common history, kasugamycin and blasticidin S, enter bacterial cells. Both mimic naturally occurring nutrients to trick E. coli into actively bringing them inside. Kasugamycin is used to control microbes that cause agricultural diseases and mutations that reduce uptake like those we describe here may be an underappreciated factor in the development of resistance to kasugamycin."]
