["Background", "Nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous signaling mediator in various physiological processes. However, there are less reports concerning the effects of NO on fungal secondary metabolites. Hypocrellins are effective anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents from fungal perylenequinone pigments of Shiraia. NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was used as a chemical elicitor to promote hypocrellin biosynthesis in Shiraia mycelium cultures.", "Results", "SNP application at 0.01\u20130.20\u00a0mM was found to stimulate significantly fungal production of perylenequinones including hypocrellin A (HA) and elsinochrome A (EA). SNP application could not only enhance HA content by 178.96% in mycelia, but also stimulate its efflux to the medium. After 4\u00a0days of SNP application at 0.02\u00a0mM, the highest total production (110.34\u00a0mg/L) of HA was achieved without any growth suppression. SNP released NO in mycelia and acted as a pro-oxidant, thereby up-regulating the gene expression and activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating NADPH oxidase (NOX) and antioxidant enzymes, leading to the increased levels of superoxide anion (O2\u2212) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that SNP treatment could up-regulate biosynthetic genes for hypocrellins and activate the transporter protein major facilitator superfamily (MFS) for the exudation. Moreover, SNP treatment increased the proportion of total unsaturated fatty acids in the hypha membranes and enhanced membrane permeability. Our results indicated both cellular biosynthesis of HA and its secretion could contribute to HA production induced by SNP.", "Conclusions", "The results of this study provide a valuable strategy for large-scale hypocrellin production and can facilitate further understanding and exploration of NO signaling in the biosynthesis of the important fungal metabolites.", "Supplementary Information", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12934-021-01581-8."]
