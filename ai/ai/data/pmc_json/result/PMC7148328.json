["Results", "Dbv6 and Dbv22 are transcriptional repressors of A40926 biosynthesis", "N. gerenzanensis mutants defective in dbv6 and dbv22 were constructed as previously reported6 and as described under Material and Methods, respectively. When N. gerenzanensis was grown in a rich medium (RARE3) that affords good growth but moderate glycopeptide production, disruption of dbv6 or dbv22 did not significantly affect biomass accumulation (Fig.\u00a02A). Interestingly, bioassays (Fig.\u00a02B) of culture broth collected along the growth showed that antibiotic production started at 54\u2009h in both mutants (12\u2009h earlier than in the parental strain) and proceeded to higher levels up to 96\u2009h, the last analyzed time point. Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of 96-h culture broths showed that the \u0394dbv6 and \u0394dbv22 mutants produced 52 and 70\u2009\u00b5g/mL acA40926, respectively, in comparison with 34\u2009\u00b5g/mL, as observed with the parental strain.Figure 2Growth curves and antibiotic production by N. gerenzanensis wild type, \u0394dbv6 and \u0394dbv22 strains in RARE3 medium.

Interestingly, under these conditions, we observed a small but consistent decrease in biomass accumulation, which was inversely related to the amount of produced glycopeptide. There was no difference in complex composition between the mutants and the wild type (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1), with acA40926 as the main product at all time points in the three strains.Figure 3AcA40926 production and growth in V40P medium of the wild type, \u0394dbv6 and \u0394dbv22 strains.

Across two different media, deletion of dbv22 has a more prominent effect than dbv6.", "Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis after 54\u2009h of growth in RARE3 medium of the wild type and the two mutants was carried out to identify the Dbv6/Dbv22 target genes within the dbv cluster (Fig.\u00a04). We focused our attention on ten genes as representatives of all the dbv operons. Besides the regulators dbv3, dbv4 and dbv6, the analysis was carried out on the biosynthetic genes dbv1 and dbv5 (HPG synthesis), dbv23 (mannose acetylation) and dbv15 (MbtH-like protein assisting NRPS action), on the ABC-transporter genes dbv18, and dbv24, and on the resistance gene dbv75,21 (Fig.\u00a01C). Consistent with the results from bioassays and LC-MS analysis, qRT-PCR analysis showed that transcription of some analyzed genes was strongly influenced by deletion of dbv6 and more so by dbv22 genes (Fig.\u00a04). Indeed, the transcriptional levels of dbv3, dbv4, dbv5, dbv23 and dbv24 increased approximately 2\u20135 fold in the \u0394dbv6 mutant and 5\u201320 fold in the \u0394dbv22 mutant; in contrast, dbv7 was apparently not transcribed in both mutants. The transcriptional levels of dbv1, dbv6, and dbv18 were not influenced by either mutation (Fig.\u00a04).Figure 4qRT-PCR of dbv genes in the wild type and \u0394dbv6 and \u0394dbv22 mutant strains.

Consistent with previous results19, the wild type strain formed no visible colonies when plated on medium containing 4\u2009\u00b5g/mL A40926. Remarkably, it was more sensitive to acA40926 than to its desacetylated precursor, with a significant reduction in the ability to form colonies observed already at 0.5\u20131\u2009\u00b5g/mL (Fig.\u00a05). No significant differences between the wild type and the \u0394dbv6 mutant were observed. In contrast, the \u0394dbv22 mutant strain was more sensitive to acA40926 and A40926, and it was able to form visible colonies only with up to 0.5 and 0.2\u2009\u00b5g/mL of A40926 and acA40926, respectively (Fig.\u00a05). Thus, consistent with qRT-PCR analysis, Dbv22 positively controls resistance to glycopeptides, likely by regulating expression of the carboxypeptidase Dbv7. The lack of an effect on glycopeptide resistance by the dbv6 deletion might be due to the narrow range of glycopeptide concentration in which an effect is seen.Figure 5Resistance assay of the wild type and \u0394dbv6 and \u0394dbv22 mutant strains.

Previous work had also indicated that exogenously added acA40926, but not its desacetylated form, had an inhibitory effect on glycopeptide production2. We thus wondered whether exogenously added glycopeptides would have any effect on the transcriptional levels of the Dbv6/Dbv22 target genes. To this end, a 24\u2009h culture of the parental strain inV40P medium was equally divided into three flasks, with each flask receiving either 0.5\u2009\u00b5g/mL A40926, 0.5\u2009\u00b5g/mL acA40926 or no addition. After further 2- and 5-h incubation, RNA was extracted and the transcriptional levels of all the regulatory genes (dbv3, dbv4 and dbv6) and of the Dbv6-targeted genes (dbv7, dbv23 and dbv24) were analyzed by qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a06). Addition of acA40926 had a modest inducing effect on the expression of the regulatory genes dbv4 and dbv6, the resistance gene dbv7 and the acetyltransferase gene dbv23, but only 2\u2009h after compound addition. After 5\u2009h, genes were slightly repressed (dbv3, dbv4, dbv6 and dbv7) or unaffected (dbv23 and dbv24). In contrast, addition of A40926 did not significantly affect transcription levels after 2\u2009h. However, after 5\u2009h all the analyzed genes were induced, with transcription levels 2-fold (for dbv3), 3\u20136-fold (for dbv4, dbv6 and dbv7) or 13\u201314-fold (for dbv23 and dbv24) higher relative to uninduced cells. qRT-PCR of the analyzed dbv genes in all three cultures before induction indicated modest flask-to-flask variation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2).Figure 6qRT-PCR analysis of the gene expression of dbv3, dbv4, dbv6, dbv7, dbv23 and dbv24 in the wild type strain.

When a similar experiment was carried out with the \u0394dbv4 mutant strain, which does not produce any glycopeptide6, we could not detect any transcription of dbv23 and dbv24, suggesting that these genes might be indirect targets of Dbv4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3). Thus, one or more components of the glycopeptide complex or intermediates thereof could exert a positive feedback on the transcription of at least some dbv genes.", "Direct control of Dbv6 on dbv4 and dbv7 gene expression", "We investigated whether Dbv6 can bind to the upstream region of the target genes and directly control their expression. Gel mobility shift assays of the regions upstream to dbv3, dbv4, dbv6, dbv7, dbv23 and dbv24 were carried out using a purified His-tagged Dbv6 protein overexpressed in E. coli. These assays did reveal a binding activity of Dbv6 towards the upstream regions of the regulatory genes dbv3 and dbv4, of the resistance gene dbv7, of the genes dbv23-dbv22, coding for the acetyltransferase and the sensor kinase, and of the operon dbv24-dbv28, which encodes an ABC-transporter, two NRPS modules, the N-methyltransferase and the enzyme involved in \u03b2-hydroxylation of the tyrosine residue (Fig.\u00a07). No shift was detected using the upstream region of dbv6 (Fig.\u00a07). Control experiments using the internal region of the vegetative sigma factor encoding gene (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4) further confirmed the specificity of DNA binding by Dbv6 observed on some of the target genes. Thus, these data are consistent with Dbv6 directly controlling expression of the target genes. Further studies will be necessary to understand how Dbv6 exerts positive and negative control on different DNA regions.Figure 7Gel mobility shift assays of DNA regions upstream of dbv3, dbv4, dbv7, dbv23, dbv24 and dbv6.

However, reciprocal Blast searches indicate that Dbv6 and Dbv22 are not orthologs of VanRsc and VanSsc, respectively. Inspired by recent work on phylogenetic analysis of cluster-associated StrR- and LuxR-related regulators22, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of TCSs from actinomycetes. To this end, we retrieved response regulators and sensory kinases associated with characterized actinobacterial gene clusters from the MiBIG database23, well-characterized TCSs from Streptomyces coelicolor24,25 and the response regulators and sensory kinases identified in the N. gerenzanensis genome18 (Fig.\u00a08).Figure 8Phylogenetic analysis of 62 response regulators (left panel) and 65 sensory kinases (right panel).

Kistamicin A is a partially cross-linked heptapeptide sharing some amino acid residues with glycopeptide antibiotics, whereas feglymycin is a linear tridecapeptide containing several HPG and DPG residues. Both compounds have antiviral activity but modest antibacterial activity in comparison with glycopeptide antibiotics28\u201330.", "A similar picture emerges when analyzing the sensory kinases: those associated with the balhimycin, teicoplanin and A47934 clusters, and S. coelicolor VanS form a separate branch from the one containing Dbv22 and the kistamicin A- and flegymycin-associated sequences (Fig.\u00a08, right panel).
