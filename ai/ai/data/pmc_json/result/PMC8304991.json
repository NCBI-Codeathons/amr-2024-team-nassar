["2. Results", "2.1. B. bifidum FHB150 Form Biofilm on WF", "In this study, we used WF as a carrier in the fermentation system and evaluated the biofilm formation by the biofilm formation rate, carrier particle size and FESEM. The pH values in the control and WF cultures of B. bifidum were decreased during fermentation and lower than 4.0 at 32 h (Figure 1a). The pH value in WF culture was significantly lower than that in control culture at 10 h (p < 0.05). There were 1.95 \u00d7 108 and 1.03 \u00d7 109 CFU/mL in the control culture and the WF culture at 10 h (Figure 1b), respectively (p < 0.05). These results suggest that cells attached to carriers in the early fermentation stage and proliferated rapidly, producing more acidic substances than control culture. Figure 1c shows WF with an average particle size of around 50 \u00b5m. However, the average particle size was over 150 \u00b5m (Figure 1d) with the biofilm rate higher than 85% (Figure 1b) at 22 h. The FESEM results showed that B. bifidum cells adhered to the surface of WF (Figure 1e) and secreted extracellular substances to form the biofilm (Figure 1f). The biofilm rate, carrier particle size and FESEM results indicate that the formation of B. bifidum biofilm includes the adsorption of cells to the carrier at the initial stage (0\u201310 h), the growth and development of the biofilm (22\u201332 h) and the dispersion of the biofilm.", "2.2. Key Genes Involved in B. bifidum Biofilm Formation", "2.2.1. Two Hundred Thirty-Five Nonredundant DEGs during the Biofilm Formation Were Identified", "Biofilm formation is a complex dynamic process, generally established through surface attachment, biofilm maturation and biofilm dispersion [18]. To identify the key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during B. bifidum biofilm formation, transcriptomic analysis was conducted on both biofilm and planktonic samples collected at 22 and 32 h. Specified pairwise transcriptome comparisons were performed: 22 h B vs. 22 h P; 32 h B vs. 32 h P; 32 h B vs. 22 h B; 32 h P vs. 22 h P. There were 120 DEGs in 22 h B vs. 22 h P (56 DEGs upregulated, 64 downregulated) (Figure 2a). However, there were only 16 DEGs in 32 h B vs. 32 h P (3 upregulated, 13 downregulated) (Figure 2b), indicating that there was little difference in gene expression between the biofilm and planktonic cell state. To further explore the DEGs related to biofilm growth from 22 to 32 h, we compared the cell growth gene changes in WF group (32 h B vs. 22 h B) and control group (32 h P vs. 22 h P) (Figure 2c). This analysis yielded 126 DEGs associated with biofilm growth, including 53 upregulated and 73 downregulated genes (Figure 2d). The Venn diagram shows the 235 nonredundant DEGs during B. bifidum biofilm formation, including vanY, pstS, degP, groS, infC, groL, yajC and tadB (Figure 2e).", "2.2.2. Function of DEGs during B. bifidum Biofilm Formation", "To investigate the function of these nonredundant DEGs during B. bifidum biofilm formation, we performed a functional analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway terms (Figure 3). Thirteen genes (budA, cscA, folC, groL, groS, infC, mgtA, mrp, nrdG, rarD, tam, ulaE) were categorized into \u201cbiological process\u201d (BP), \u201ccellular component\u201d (CC) and \u201cmolecular function\u201d (CF) GO terms, including \u201cresponse to abiotic stimulus\u201d, \u201cregulation of gene expression\u201d, \u201cextracellular region\u201d, \u201ctransporter activity\u201d and \u201cpeptide biosynthetic process\u201d, and the top 10 terms are shown in Figure 3a. Meanwhile, Figure 3b shows the KEGG pathways of DEGs, including \u201ctwo-component system\u201d (Bbi37|peg.1341, degP, pstS, vanY), \u201camino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism\u201d (Bbi37|peg.282, Bbi37|peg.249, Bbi37|peg.376, Bbi37|peg.680, Bbi37|peg.1418, Bbi37|peg.1494), \u201cpeptidoglycan biosynthesis\u201d (pbpB, pon1, vanY), \u201cquorum sensing\u201d (Bbi37|peg.1221) and \u201cbiosynthesis of amino acids\u201d (metC). There was only one functional DEG (tam) identified in 32 h that was labeled \u201cinterspecies interaction between organisms\u201d. Interestingly, the DEGs from 22 to 32 h were associated with functional terms, including \u201cresponse to stress\u201d (infC, groL), \u201coxidation\u2013reduction process\u201d (asd, bcp, nrdG), \u201ccysteine and methionine metabolism\u201d (asd, cysB, ilvE, metC), \u201clysine biosynthesis\u201d (asd, dapD), \u201calanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism\u201d (iaaA), \u201clipid metabolic process\u201d (pldB, dus) and \u201cbacterial secretion system, quorum sensing\u201d (yajC) (Figure 3c,d). The function of DEGs indicates that biofilm formation of B. bifidum was related to abiotic stimulation, stress response, protein and polysaccharide biosynthesis, two-component system, quorum sensing and global regulatory factors.", "Genes with similar expression patterns may have similar functions, which makes it is possible to predict DEGs\u2019 function without annotation names involved in B. bifidum biofilm formation. The fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments (FPKM) was used to conduct the hierarchical clustering analysis of transcript abundance, and 1890 genes were divided into two clusters (high and low) based on the expression of genes (Figure 4). Remarkably, 22 h B vs. 22 h P were involved in 120 DEGs, of which 25 DEGs were shared with 32 h B vs. 22 h B. There were 10 DEGs (metC, infC, ybjQ, Bbi37|rna.25, Bbi37|peg.509, Bbi37|peg.510, Bbi37|peg.650, Bbi37|peg.1181 and Bbi37|peg.1182 were highly expressed, while gla was lowly expressed) downregulated in 22 h B vs. 22 h P but upregulated in 32 h B vs. 22 h B. Fifteen DEGs (groL, gyrB2, mug, nrdG, ydeD and Bbi37|peg.1148 were highly expressed, while rarD, Bbi37|rna.24, Bbi37|peg.1148, Bbi37|peg.227, Bbi37|peg.965, Bbi37|peg.1250, Bbi37|peg.1336, Bbi37|peg.1728 and Bbi37|peg.1733 were lowly expressed) were upregulated in 22 h B vs. 22 h P but downregulated in 32 h B vs. 22 h B.", "2.2.3. The Interaction of DEGs during B. bifidum Biofilm Formation", "To further investigate the interaction of these nonredundant DEGs during B. bifidum biofilm formation, we used the STRING database to identify potential interactions between them. A protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network between DEGs was constructed, and five hub genes (degP, groL, groS, hrcA, sigA) were identified by MCODE (Figure 5). Despite there being 235 nonredundant genes that were differentially expressed, the final PPI network only had 18 genes, which means that the interaction of most DEGs during biofilm formation is still unknown. degP was related to two-component system, upregulated during biofilm formation (22 h B vs. 22 h P, 32 h B vs. 22 h B). groL (prevents misfolding and promotes the refolding and proper assembly of unfolded polypeptides generated under stress conditions) and groS (binds to Cpn60 in the presence of Mg-ATP and suppresses the ATPase activity of the latter) were both upregulated in 22 h B vs. 22 h P, related to the stress response. sigA (the primary sigma factor during exponential growth) was also upregulated in 22 h B vs. 22 h P. hrcA, negative regulator of groELS operons, was downregulated in 32 h B vs. 22 h B. Notably, yajC (preprotein translocase subunit) associated with protein export and quorum sensing was 2.44-fold upregulated in 32 h B vs. 22 h B. The interaction of DEGs indicates that two-component system, quorum sensing and protein biosynthesis were upregulated after B. bifidum was stimulated by stress during biofilm growth.", "2.3. Main Metabolites Involved in B. bifidum Biofilm Formation", "2.3.1. Metabolite Profiling Changes and Enrichment Pathway Analysis during Biofilm Formation", "LC-MS data analysis of biofilm (cells on the WF surface) and planktonic (cells in control group) metabolites yielded 1070 molecular features in total (Figure 6). There were 62 metabolites upregulated in 22 h B vs. 22 h P with FC of \u22652 and 39 metabolites downregulated with FC \u2264 \u22122 (a). Figure 6b shows that the enriched pathways of these differentially expressed metabolites (arachidic acid, butyric acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, L-cystine, L-lysine, L-threonine, melatonin) included valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; biotin metabolism; butanoate metabolism; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; lysine degradation; galactose metabolism; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; cysteine and methionine metabolism; and tryptophan metabolism.", "In 32 h WF vs. 32 h C, 54 metabolites were upregulated and 45 metabolites were downregulated (Figure 6c). There were seven metabolites (palmitic acid, arachidic acid, L-serine, methylmalonic acid, palmitic acid, spermine, sphinganine) in 32 h B vs. 32 h P (Figure 6d) associated with biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; sphingolipid metabolism; beta-alanine metabolism; glutathione metabolism; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; cysteine and methionine metabolism; arginine and proline metabolism; valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation; and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis.", "Only 46 metabolites showed 2 FC (18 metabolites upregulated, 28 metabolites downregulated) between 32 h B vs. 22 h B and 32 h P vs. 22 h P (22\u201332 h was the biofilm growth period) (Figure 6e). However, these differentially expressed metabolites associated with the most enriched pathway (D-galactose, histamine, L-cystine, L-threonine, L-tyrosine, methylmalonic acid, niacinamide): galactose metabolism; phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; ubiquinone and other terpenoid\u2013quinone biosynthesis; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; phenylalanine metabolism; nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism; histidine metabolism; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; cysteine and methionine metabolism; amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism; valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation; and tyrosine metabolism (Figure 6f).", "Figure 6Metabolite profiling changes and enrichment pathway analysis during biofilm formation.

Function of Differentially Expressed Metabolites", "To further study the key metabolites during biofilm formation, we used MetaboAnalyst 5.0 to search the function of 219 nonredundant differentially expressed metabolites. Notably, 22 metabolites were mainly amino acids, short-chain fatty acids and vitamins (Figure 7). L-Cystine (KEGG C00491), asparaginyl-leucine (HMP HMDB0028735), tocopherol (KEGG C02483), butyric acid (KEGG C00246), phosphoric acid (KEGG C00009) and pentacosanoic acid (HMP HMDB0002361) were respectively upregulated 2.67-, 2.11-, 2.10-, 2.03-, 6.37-, and 8.70-fold in 22 h B vs. 22 h P. Leucylproline (HMP HMDB0011175), N-undecanoylglycine (HMP HMDB0013286), tocopherol, sphinganine (KEGG C00836), methylmalonic acid (KEGG C02170) and pentacosanoic acid were respectively upregulated 5.39-, 2.34-, 3.52-, 3.55-, 2.08- and 7.10-fold in 32 h B vs. 32 h P. Leucyl-asparagine (HMP HMDB0028924), L-serine (KEGG C00065) and spermine (KEGG C00750) were respectively downregulated 3.95-, 2.08- and 2.14-fold in 32 h B vs. 32 h P.

This finding indicates that amino acids, short-chain fatty acids and vitamins were key metabolites and their expression levels were different during biofilm formation.", "2.4. Thirteen Pathways Were Identified during the Integration of Both Transcriptomics and Metabolomics Data", "To provide a more comprehensive understanding of biofilm formation, the transcript\u2013metabolite interaction network was generated for DEGs and the differentially expressed metabolites. The gene\u2013metabolite interaction consists of 36 nodes connected via 41 edges (Figure 8). Thirteen pathways were identified during the integration of both transcriptomics and metabolomics data, including ABC transporters; ascorbate and aldarate metabolism; biosynthesis of cofactors; cysteine and methionine metabolism; glutathione metabolism; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; oxidative phosphorylation; pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis; phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; quorum sensing; two-component system; valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation. The DEGs that relate to the integration pathways included asd, atpB, degP, folC, ilvE, metC, pheA, pstS, pyrE, serB, ulaE, yajC and zwf. The differentially accumulated metabolites included L-cystine, L-serine, L-threonine, L-tyrosine, methylmalonate, monodehydroascorbate, nicotinamide, orthophosphate, spermine and tocopherol. Overall, the integration analysis successfully identified pathways that may be associated with biofilm formation."]
