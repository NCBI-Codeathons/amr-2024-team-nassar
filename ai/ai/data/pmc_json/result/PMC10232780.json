Compared to the group without antibiotic in the 1-M colon model (1CON-LAC, 1CON-2FL, and 1CON-GOS), the total bacterial 16S rRNA gene counts were significantly higher in the antibiotic-treated group (1\u2009AC-LAC, 1\u2009AC-2FL, and 1\u2009AC-GOS) at time point 52 and 56\u2009h (Supplementary Figure 2). In both 1-M and 3-M colon models, antibiotic-treated microbiota shifted to a community associated with a higher relative abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and unidentified genus within the Enterobacteriaceae family (Figure 2). The exposure of amoxicillin/clavulanate was associated with a decreased absolute abundance of the majority of taxa (Figure 3). Moreover, the absolute abundance of unidentified genus of Enterobacteriaceae, Parabacteroides, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, and Streptococcus was significantly higher in the antibiotic-treated microbiota of the 1-M colon model compared to the group without antibiotic at multiple time points. In the antibiotic-treated microbiota of the 3-M colon model, compared to the untreated group, the absolute abundance of unidentified genus of Enterobacteriaceae increased while a decrease was seen in the absolute abundance of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Megasphaera, among other taxa. In the 1-M colon model, the antibiotic-treated microbiota dominated by unidentified Enterobacteriaceae 02 ASV (in both runs of 1\u2009AC-2FL and one run of 1\u2009AC-LAC or 1\u2009AC-GOS) showed a relatively faster recovery at time point 72\u2009h compared to the community associated with unidentified Enterobacteriaceae 01 ASV (Supplementary Figure 3).", "Figure 2Microbial composition (absolute abundance and proportion) at genus level of infant gut microbiota cultivated in TIM-2.

After the last exposure to the antibiotic, the phylogenetic diversity slowly recovered, but did not reach the values of the non-treated samples at 72\u2009h and was still statistically significantly different in 1-M microbiota. Moreover, the phylogenetic diversity of the 3-M microbiota was not yet completely recovered at 72\u2009h, although the differences were only statistically significant up to 52\u2009h. The same pattern was seen in the observed number of genera between the groups with and without antibiotic exposure for either of the age groups, while a significant difference in effective Shannon diversity of genera (the number of equally abundant genera) between the antibiotic-treated group compared to the untreated group was only observed at time point 8\u201348\u2009h in the 3-M colon model (Supplementary Figure 4).", "Figure 4Phylogenetic diversity of microbiota of groups treated with and without amoxicillin/clavulanate.

In order to evaluate changes in microbiota composition due to time-dependent treatment effects, Principal Response Curve (PRC) analysis was performed in which the trajectory of the control runs without antibiotic and prebiotic were used as a reference (1CON-LAC and 3CON-LAC in 1-M and 3-M colon models, respectively). In 1-M microbiota, the PRC on log10-transformed genus-level absolute abundances estimated that time explained 36% of the variance while the treatment and its interaction with time explained 48%. The microbiota of amoxicillin/clavulanate treated group (1\u2009AC-LAC, 1\u2009AC-2FL, and 1\u2009AC-GOS) started to deviate from the reference (1CON-LAC) and prebiotic supplemented group (1CON-2FL and 1CON-GOS) before time point 24\u2009h (no sample for microbiota analysis was taken between antibiotic addition at 8 and 24\u2009h) and started to recover at time point 48\u2009h for 1\u2009AC-2FL treatment and at time point 56\u2009h for both 1\u2009AC-LAC and 1\u2009AC-GOS (Figure 5A).", "Figure 5Principal response curve (PRC), resulting from the analysis of microbiota grouped by treatment in the 1-M colon model.

The sign of the taxon weight indicates the direction of the changes, while the score magnitude reflects the size of the changes. The positive weighting of a taxa group indicate a decrease in their absolute abundance due to antibiotic treatment, including Ruminococcus gnavus group, Lachnoclostridium, Peptoniphilus, Clostridium sensu stricto 18, and Veillonella, among others. In contrast, the negative weighting of a taxa group indicate an increase in their absolute abundance due to antibiotic treatment, including unidentified genus of Enterobacteriaceae, unidentified genus of Enterobacterales, Streptococcus, and Parasutterella. These changes in the absolute abundances (QMP) of taxa listed in the PRC of 1-M microbiota can be further seen in Supplementary Figure 7. Moreover, GUniFrac distance-based PRC analysis on the first axis showed that time explained 32% of the variance while the interaction between time and treatment with antibiotic explained 59%. In this GUniFrac-PRC, unidentified genus of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 were the main drivers of microbiota changes due to antibiotic treatment, while supplementation of 2\u2019-FL (1\u2009AC-2FL) supported full recovery from time point 56\u2009h (Figure 5B).", "In the case of 3-M microbiota, PRC analysis based on log10-transformed absolute abundances indicated that time explained 27% of the variance, while the interaction between treatment and time explained 46%.

Antibiotic exposure showed significant associations with an increased lactate production and a decrease in the production of propionate and iso-valerate in the 1-M model (Figure 7A).

The supplementation of GOS was significantly associated with a higher production of acetate, butyrate and succinate in the 1-M colon model, compared to the treatment lacking of prebiotics (Figure 7C). In the 3-M colon model, the supplementation of GOS was weakly associated with a higher production of acetate and a lower production of ammonia at multiple time points. In addition, an increasing trend was seen in butyrate production from both runs of antibiotic-treated microbiota supplemented with GOS (3\u2009AC-GOS), compared to the lack of butyrate produced in antibiotic-treated microbiota without prebiotic (Supplementary Figure 9).", "It is worth noting that some traces of lactose, galactose, and glucose were detected at a specific time point during the antibiotic course in multiple runs of 1\u2009AC-GOS (Supplementary Figure 9).

Moreover, the abundance of Peptoniphilus was positively correlated with ammonia and the abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus group was positively correlated with iso-butyrate and acetate production. For the antibiotic-exposed microbiota, the level of iso-valerate was positively correlated with Lachnoclostridium and Erysipelatoclostridium (Figure 8B).
