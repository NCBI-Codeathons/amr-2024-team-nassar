["Results", "Cpz10 and 15 are nonheme oxygenases", "Two genes, cpz10 and cpz15, that code for \u03b1KG dependent enzymes, exhibit in the BGC of caprazamycin. In silico analysis, cpz15 is a homolog to the clavaminic acid synthetase (CAS)-like protein, which also appears in the BGCs of liposodomycin, jawsamycin, capuramycin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01) and muraymycin (6, 7). The one in muraymycin is mur16 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02), while the functions of Cpz15 and Mur16 were annotated differently. Cpz15 is designated as an oxygenase (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03) responsible for the \u03b2-hydroxylation at a later step in contrast to Mur16 that engages in an oxidative dephosphorylation reaction in the very first step14. Rather, Cpz10 was assigned a role as that of Mur16. Recently, Cpz15 is re-proposed as the starter enzyme responsible for the oxidative dephosphorylation reaction21. To resolve this controversy, we set off biochemical examination for purified Cpz10 or Cpz15 versus possible substrates, including uridine, uridine monophosphate (UMP), uridine diphosphate (UDP) and uridine triphosphate (UTP). Of them, only did a new peak emerge on the LC trace concomitant with dwindling of UMP in the reactions with Cpz15 (Fig.\u00a02A, and 3A). This new peak was subjected to MS analysis, which showed a mass unit (M\u2009+\u2009H)+ of m/z\u2009=\u2009243.1 indicating formation of uridine 5\u2032-aldehide (U5\u2019A 9) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04)22, thereby redefining Cpz15 a nonheme-dependent oxidative de-phosphorylase rather than a \u03b2-hydroxylase.Fig. 2Reaction scheme for selected enzymes referred to in this study.A Biosynthetic steps committed by Cpz15, Cpz14/Mur17, Cpz13 and Cpz10 in sequence.

To confirm this prediction, we expressed Cpz14 in E. coli or Streptomyces, while, unfortunately, it is insoluble in either system. To overcome this problem, we borrowed Mur17 from the muraymycin BGC, an enzyme equivalent to Cpz14 and soluble in E. coli. The LC/MS analysis shows formation of compound 10 (expected mass unit at m/z\u2009=\u2009318.16 (M\u2009+\u2009H)+) for the reactions with compound 9 and threonine plus Mur17 (Figs.\u00a02A and\u00a03B; and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05) in agreement with previous results6,23. Interestingly, not only threonine but also glycine can be accepted by Mur17 while assayed against all proteinogenic L-amino acids and their D-isomers.", "Cpz10 is the \u03b2-hydroxylase", "Since Cpz15 is not the \u03b2-hydroxylase, the likelihood now befalls Cpz10. In silico analysis, Cpz10 also shows protein sequence similarity/identity analogous to nonheme \u03b1KG dependent enzymes closest to aspartyl/asparaginyl \u03b2-hydroxylase (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). Concerning the reaction timing/order, the \u03b2-hydroxylation could occur on free amino acids, compound 11 (see below), or the seven-membered heterocyclic ring (e.g. compound 8 without \u03b2-OH). We first assayed Cpz10 against all L/D-amino acids, dopamine and pipecolic (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). Interestingly, L-methionine and L-selenomethionine were found subject to oxygenation, while the oxygenation takes place at the sulfur (MSO)/selenium atom instead of the expected \u03b2-carbon (\u03b2C; HR-MS, LC-MS/MS in conjunction with 2D NMR confirms the product is MSO with the (M\u2009+\u2009H)+ ion at m/z\u2009=\u2009166.05, Figs.\u00a02B and\u00a03C and Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). Next, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was examined, which was however ruled out as no product found (data not shown). It has been proposed that the four-carbon sidechain is transferred from SAM to compound 10 by Cpz13 to compound 11 (Figs.\u00a02A and\u00a03B, D and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a). Because compound 9 is highly unstable, the production of compounds 10 and 11 is therefore limited. These two compounds were then chemically synthesized (see Supplementary methods) following previously published methodologies in total synthesis of caprazamycin14. With the synthetic compound 11 in hand, Cpz10 were examined, of which a new peak was brought on LC traces (Fig.\u00a02A, and Fig.\u00a03D). HR-MS and LC-MS/MS analysis showed that this new peak has an (M\u2009+\u2009H)+ ion at m/z\u2009=\u2009435.1357 in line with the predicted molecular weight of the hydroxylated compound 11 (m/z\u2009=\u2009435.1358 for C15H22N4O11\u2009+\u2009H) (see Supplementary Note\u00a01). X-ray crystallography, at long last, confirmed that the peak is \u0251-amino-\u03b2-hydroxylbutanoyl-glycyluridine (compound 12) (see below). Because of limited quantity of compound 11, we took advantage of L-methionine (as Cpz10 can oxygenate it to MSO) to estimate the basic kinetics for Cpz10; the Michaelis constant and turnover rate were determined under the pseudo-first order condition: Km\u2009=\u2009892.1\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u2009\u03bcM and kcat\u2009=\u200958.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009min\u22121, which are comparable to those of typical nonheme monooxygenases (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09).", "Cpz10 X-ray crystal structures reveal two irons", "To better understand the catalytic mechanism of Cpz10, we set out to determine crystal structures of Cpz10 in apo and complex forms (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010). The purified Cpz10 was first crystallized and subjected to X-ray diffraction. The phase problem was solved using molecular replacement (MR), whereby the initial model obtained was used as the template for building complex structures. We determined five structures, including one apo structure (PDB code: 7V4N), two mutants (PDB codes: 7V4O and 7V4P) and two complexes (with \u03b1KG (PDB code: 7V4M), or with succinic acid (SA), compound 12 (PDB code: 7V4F) (see below, and Supplementary Fig.\u00a011B for stereo views and density maps; the data-collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table\u00a01). Based on gel filtration chromatograph, Cpz10 is a homodimer in an aqueous solution (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012). Consistently, two polypeptide chains are packed in an asymmetric unit (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011) with immense protein-protein interactions at the dimer interface. A single polypeptide chain is folded in a twisted \u03b2-sheet jelly roll (cupin) domain, a common fold for a typical \u03b1KG-dependent nonheme enzyme24. Unexpectedly, two iron metals were identified intrinsically existing in all structures determined except the apo form. The ferric iron, labeled Fe1, is held by an archetypal metal-chelating triad (His115, His160, Asp117), \u03b1KG that coordinates to Fe1 in a bidentate manner, and a water molecule (Wt91) that takes the sixth coordinate altogether to form a tetragonal bipyramidal geometry (Fig.\u00a04)17,25,26. This 6-coordinate complex is akin to most reported complexes of \u03b1KG-dependent enzymes, where the carboxyl group of \u03b1KG coordinates trans to the distal histidine. As to the second iron, labeled Fe2, it is associated with two water molecules (Wt56 and Wt89) in close proximity to residues Arg170, Arg133, His144, Thr128, and Ile145 but away from Fe1 by 12\u2009\u00c5 (Fig.\u00a04 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a013).Table 1Data collection and refinement statistics (molecular replacement).7V4N7V4M7V4F7V4O7V4PData collectionSpace groupP 43 21 2C 2 2 21P 43 21 2C 1 2 1P 43 21 2Cell dimensions\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a, b, c (\u00c5)82.2, 82.2, 104.275.18, 77.56, 68.1182.04, 82.04, 103.89150.83, 39.03, 76.5982.04, 82.04, 103.89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 (\u00b0)90, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 119.33, 76.5990, 90, 90Resolution (\u00c5)29.83\u20132.20 (2.28\u20132.20)19.86\u20131.90 (1.97\u20131.90)26.48\u20131.97 (2.04\u20131.97)25.03\u20131.65 (1.71\u20131.65)26.46\u20131.94 (2.02\u20131.95)Rsym or Rmerge0.078 (0.79)0.039 (0.501)0.040 (0.570)0.051 (0.141)0.066 (0.509)I/\u03c3I24.9 (3.4)23.6 (2.4)33.5 (3.8)32.3 (13.1)36.9 (4.2)Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)100.0 (100.0)96.2 (98.1)99.0 (100.0)100.0 (100.0)Redundancy14.4 (14.7)5.3 (5.4)9.8 (9.9)7.0 (7.9)15.7 (13.2)RefinementResolution (\u00c5)2.21.91.981.651.95No. reflections1781215444252854671526621Rwork/Rfree0.1864/0.23930.1865/0.23310.1911/0.25100.1803/0.21380.1877/0.2413No. atoms\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Protein1403/140613741400/13901447/14471404/1399\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ligand/ion2184517/172\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Water44135171421112B-factors\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Protein30.14/36.7421.7324.36/32.2316.77/13.9323.24/23.41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ligand/ion49.9928.326.9325.12537.14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Water25.9732.4130.7527.2120.29R.m.s. deviations\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bond lengths (\u00c5)0.00850.0070.0080.0060.011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bond angles (\u00b0)1.36950.9191.131.031.27Fig. 4Crystal structure of Cpz10 in complex with irons and \u03b1-KG.A The overall structure of Cpz10, of which the polypeptide chain (colored cyan) folds into a major distorted jelly roll \u03b2-sheet core and an \u03b1-helical-loop domain.

Interestingly, a cluster of aromatic or soft atom-containing residues, His172, His144, Thr128, His123, Tyr112, and Met104, are identified to form a cryptic electron/charge-transfer tunnel in a manner similar to that observed in Rieske-type oxygenases (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014a, b)27\u201329: residues His172 and His123 (2.8\u2009\u00c5) take a unique geographic position in a two-hand holding shape in close proximity to Fe2 akin to the one reported in L-proline cis-4-hydroxylase (PDB CODE: 4P7X) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a015)16; residues Thr128 and His144 are on par with residues His172 and His123 in a position to interact with Fe2. Fe1 that is held firmly by chelating residues in a short and strong coordinate covalent bond manner (2.0\u20132.2\u2009\u00c5); in contrast, Fe2 is held in a relatively loose way by nearby residues (3\u20134\u2009\u00c5) alongside a satellite water molecule (Wt56, 2.9\u2009\u00c5). These two irons are spatially and temporarily associated for electron/charge transfer by an electron/charge relay system made of a constellation of well-cooperative network Wt89, His172, His123, and \u03b1KG toward Fe1 (see below, and Fig.\u00a05A, Supplementary Movie\u00a01, Supplementary Movie\u00a02), where the distances between each set of consecutive relay stations are <2.8\u2009\u00c5. To confirm the importance of residues His172 and His123 in this electron/charge transfer system, we performed site-directed mutagenesis (H172A and H123A). Both mutants, somehow, are insoluble, implying that they may assume a critical structural role in maintaining the integrity of the tunnel in addition to the proposed electron/charge relay station.Fig. 5Schematic representation of the CT Path in Cpz10 and EPR spectra.A The hidden CT conduit is schematically presented, where CT routes are proposed from Fe2 en route pass points of Wt89, His172, His123, and \u03b1KG to Fe1 or alternatively through Arg170, \u03b1KG to Fe1.

The complex that finally obtained shows that \u03b1KG soaked in the crystals has been converted to succinic acid likely undergone an oxidative decarboxylation reaction. Likewise, the soaked compound 11 has been converted to compound 12, where a new hydroxyl group (\u03b2-OH) is installed at \u03b2C of the 2-amino-butanoic acid moiety in S-configuration (compound 12) despite that the ADR-GlyU moiety cannot be flawlessly built because of lack of well-defined electron density as a result of exposed to bulk solvent (Fig.\u00a06 and Supplementary Figs.\u00a011 and 16). Based on the quaternary complex, the overall catalytic mechanism of Cpz10 is proposed as follows: \u03b1KG is ushered into the active site in association with Fe1 (FeIII) to form a high-spin iron-centered tetragonal bipyramidal complex with a water molecule atop the tetragonal plane. Fe1 is then reduced to FeII by Fe2 through the internal electron/charge relay system identified herein. When compound 11 is placed at its binding site, O2 supersedes H2O to form a FeII-superoxide anion (or a FeIII-superoxide). The superoxide anion subsequently attacks the carbonyl carbon electrophile of \u03b1KG, resulting in formation of succinic acid (oxidative decarboxylation) and the reactive FeIV-oxo species (by heterolysis). FeIV-oxo then abstracts the nearby pro-S H-atom from the \u03b2C of compound 11 in situ to form FeIII-OH and the corresponding compound 11 radical. Compound 12 is instantly formed following the rebound recombination reaction between the compound 11 radical and the iron-bound hydroxyl radical (Fig.\u00a06)30. As to the sulfoxide formation in L-methionine, it can be attributed to this mimetic substrate adapting an unnatural conformation as well as the preference for the soft sulfur base and soft FeIII-OH acid pair (Fig.\u00a06 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a011)17,30\u201332.Fig. 6Crystal structure of Cpz10 in complex with Fe1 and \u03b1-KG and 2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid.A Closed-up view of the Cpz10 active site, where the active site Fe1 (colored orange) is coordinated with H106, H154, D108, succinic acid (SA) and 2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid moiety of compound 12 (colored green). \u03b1KG has undergone decarboxylation to form SA (colored yellow); compound 11 that replaces water (W91; Fig.\u00a04B) at the sixth coordinate has been converted to compound 12, where the newly introduced OH group poses an S-configuration at \u03b2C in agreement with expected product.

Structurally, Tyr112 exhibits two different conformations in both apo/mutant and ternary complexes. The distances of the phenolic oxygen to the nonheme iron (Fe1) differs in 7.13\u2009\u00c5 and 6.32\u2009\u00c5, where the variation is analogous to its counterparts in isopenicillin N synthase or TauD, and is correlated with appearance or disappearance of \u03b1KG, succinic acid or n-oxalylglycine in the active site33,34. Tyr112, however, seems to adapt a fixed conformation to Fe1 in the apo and mutant (R107A) structures (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017). Two mutant structures R170A (at a resolution of 1.65\u2009\u00c5) and D117G (at a resolution of 1.95\u2009\u00c5) were determined: In the former, both irons are absent, \u03b1KG is no longer present, and Tyr112 takes a fixed conformation close to His160 (2.9\u2009\u00c5) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017). In the latter, the overall structure is similar to that of apo but retaining Fe2 in contrast to apo or R170A that contains no Fe2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018), suggesting there is a dynamic interplay between Arg170 and Fe2. It is worth noting that Fe1 is held tightly by the facial triad with short dative bonds (~2.2\u2009\u00c5), while Fe2 with two satellite water (Wt56 and Wt89) is less confined at a fixed position (Supplementary Fig.\u00a016). This pair of irons may be spatially connected via a hidden electron/charge transfer conduit en route pass points of Wt56, His172, His123, and \u03b1KG to Fe1 or alternatively via Arg170, \u03b1KG to Fe1 (Fig.\u00a05A) as a relay system reminiscent to that in Rieske-type oxygenases (the distances between the pass points are <2.8\u2009\u00c5 in contrast to >3\u2009\u00c5 of those in the apo form, where Fe2 is missing)27\u201329.", "EPR for Cpz10", "To probe the oxidation/spin states of the two irons in Cpz10, the solid-state protein (freezing the sample in liquid nitrogen) at defined conditions was examined using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy at 77\u2009K. The EPR spectra display two signals, which is correlated to the two irons in Cpz10. These two signals reflect the states in the presence of \u03b1KG (Fig.\u00a05B) or in the same condition with additional ascorbic acid and L-methionine (Fig.\u00a05C). In the former, the EPR spectrum shows a strong S\u2009=\u20091/2 low-spin FeIII signal at g-value 2.02 and a relatively weak S\u2009=\u20095/2 high-spin FeIII signal at g-value 4.75 (Fig.\u00a05B). The presence of an axial low-spin signal indicates spin relaxation of ferromagnetic FeIII (35\u201337) as a result of magnetic exchange, accounting for a less constrained metal ion24,37,38. In contrast, the high-spin signal comparable to a typical nonheme FeIII is relatively broader and less intensive with a g-value shifted from 4.25 to 4.75 likely due to nonheme iron electronic reconfiguration as well as coordination dynamics39. This signal is relatively symmetric suggesting OH\u2212 ions in association to the fifth and/or sixth coordinates of the nonheme ferric iron40. In the latter, the reduced ferrous iron (FeII) is usually insensitive to EPR (S\u2009=\u20090 or S\u2009=\u20092), while the appearance of a relatively weak signal indicates a portion of FeII have oxidized and moved to a different spatial position35,39,41,42. Given that the FeIII nonheme signal (S\u2009=\u20093/2) moved back to the typical g-value at 4.2543 together with the low spin signal dwindled and shifted to 1.97, these phenomena suggest reactions are taking place and proteins are undergoing conformational changes in consistence with the reaction in the presence of substrates and reducing agents. Along with the relative distance change between the two irons (12\u20138\u2009\u00c5) and the overall protein conformational changes of Cpz10 with/without substrates (superimposition of structures with r.m.s.d. 0.54), a metal-coupled electron transfer (MCET) mechanism was proposed here, whereby electrons are transferred from the less-constrained ferrous iron to the nonheme ferric iron with assistance of an aromatic residues-relay system down the path (Supplementary movie, Fig.\u00a05A). This reasoning is coherent with the EPR analysis where the peak shape is twisted and g-value is changed to g\u2009=\u20091.97 (Fig.\u00a05C)27,44\u201347. This spectrum is similar to the EPR spectra reported for proteins with an antiferromagnetically coupled Fe2 (II/III) cluster that displays a broad axial signal with a g-value <2 (S total\u2009=\u20091/2)48,49. Moreover, minor peaks between the two major peaks are visible as shown in Fig.\u00a05C but undefinable, which should be attributed to formation of intermediate iron adducts such as ferric oxide, ferric hydroxy and paramagnetic ferric iron-substrate or product complexes37,50.", "Investigation of the nature of FeIII and FeII EPR signals by NBO analysis", "To better understand the charge/spin dynamics of active-site nonheme FeIII/FeII during the reaction, we drew on the natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis.

Furthermore, the natural charge of the FeIII in both spin states is equal to +1.069 e. Since the NEC of free FeIII cation is designated as [core] 4s 3d5 4p with the natural charge +3.0 e, the increase of valance orbital occupancies and the significant change in the natural charge of the FeIII cation bound to Cpz10 are ascribed to charge transfer (CT) interactions from six ligands, in which the 2\u2009s and 2p orbitals of oxygens and nitrogens of \u03b1KG, Wt91, His115, Asp117, and His160 coordinate with the 4\u2009s, 3d, and 4p orbitals (Supplementary Fig.\u00a019).", "During CT interactions, hybridization of valance orbitals on each cited atom is taken place in order to form the lone pair (LP) hybrid orbitals on either oxygen or nitrogen ligands as well as the lone pair* (LP*) hybrid orbitals on the FeIII, including LP*(6), LP*(7), LP*(8), and LP*(9). In all of these CT interactions, electrons are donated from the LP hybrid orbitals of either the oxygen or the nitrogen ligands into nearly empty LP* hybrid orbitals of the FeIII. NBO analysis indicates that not only the LP\u2009\u2192\u2009LP* interaction types identified in HS state are totally common to those characterized in IS state, but also the local orbital types of partner atoms in each of these interactions as well as their hybridization types and electronic occupancies are the same in both spin states (Supplementary Table\u00a02).

On the other hand, the amount of the transferred charge, qCT(refs.\u200952), between the interacting local orbitals in each common CT interaction of these two spin states are nearly the same (or the same). The stabilization energy of the LP\u2009\u2192\u2009LP* interaction is an appropriate criterion to evaluate the magnitude of the interaction strength between the LP* of FeIII and the LP of its partner atom, approximately equal to E(2) values of these common CT interactions signifying their almost identical strengths in both spin states. Therefore, on the basis of NBO results, we conclude that the nature of the weak EPR signal detected at the g value of 4.75\u2009g (Fig.\u00a05B) can be derived from both the intermediate-spin state (S\u2009=\u20093/2) and the high-spin state (S\u2009=\u20095/2) of the FeIII bound to the Cpz10 active site.", "NBO analysis shows that LP (1) orbitals on N\u03b52 atoms in His115 and His160 overlap with LP*(9) and LP*(8) of FeIII, respectively. The result of these orbital overlaps is the formation of two bonds of N\u03b52\u2013Fe type in pairs of His115\u2013Fe and His160\u2013Fe (Supplementary Fig.\u00a019). As there is only a slight difference between E(2) values of these CT interactions, the interaction strengths of the FeIII with these two His are the same (Supplementary Table\u00a02). As displayed in Supplementary Fig.\u00a019, the FeIII forms four bonds of O\u2013Fe kind of with the oxygens of Asp117, \u03b1KG, and Wt91. In all cases, electrons of both LP (1) and LP (2) orbitals on oxygens are transferred to the LP* orbitals on the FeIII. As can be seen from Supplementary Table\u00a02, the interactions between the LP (2) and LP* orbitals are much stronger than those between the LP (1) and LP* orbitals because E(2) values of the LP (2) \u2192 LP* interactions are considerably greater than those of the LP (1) \u2192 LP* interactions. Among them, the LP (2) O4\u2009\u2192\u2009LP* (7) FeIII interaction in \u03b1KG\u2013Fe pair is the strongest CT interaction because it is having the highest values of E(2) (115.90\u2009kJ\u2009mol\u22121) and qCT (0.1116 e) compared to other interactions. In addition to O4, LP* (6) and LP* (8) of the FeIII also accept electrons from LP (1) and LP (2) orbitals of its O2 atom. Of these, the LP (2) O2\u2009\u2192\u2009LP* (6) FeIII with an E(2) of 73.81\u2009kJ\u2009mol\u22121 and a qCT of 0.0624 e is the strongest CT interaction compared to other interactions of O2\u2013Fe. Moreover, the LP (2) O\u03b42\u2009\u2192\u2009LP* (6) FeIII in Asp117\u2013Fe pair is its second strong interaction out of the surrounding atoms (Supplementary Table\u00a02). Indeed, these three aforementioned CT interactions play essential roles in electron transfer process within Cpz10. In the case of interaction FeIII with Wt91, the strongest CT belongs to the LP (2) O\u2009\u2192\u2009LP* (9) FeIII interaction with an E(2) of 33.14\u2009kJ\u2009mol\u22121 and a qCT of 0.0273 e.", "In order to emerge the EPR signal from the FeII cation, the number of unpaired electron(s) in its 3d orbitals in different spin states must be odd. As known, the NEC of a free FeII cation is as [core] 4\u2009s 3d6 4p. Therefore, the free ferrous iron lacks unpaired electron in its 3d orbitals in the low-spin state (S\u2009=\u20090), whereas these orbitals possess two and four unpaired electrons in the intermediate-spin state (S\u2009=\u20091) and the high-spin state (S\u2009=\u20092), respectively. It is hence expected that the free FeII is unable to generate the EPR signal. Nevertheless, the appearance of the EPR signal at g value of 2.02 signifies the presence of FeII as a ferrous iron. NBO analysis of the FeII\u2013binding site within Cpz10 demonstrates that the FeII cation has different NECs in three states of LS ([core] 4\u2009S0.26 3d6.99 4p0.13 5S0.01 4d0.01 5p0.02), IS ([core] 4S0.30 3d6.99 4p0.13 5S0.01 5p0.02), and HS ([core] 4S1.30 3d6.05 4p0.13 4d0.01 5p0.03). As a result, due to the participation of FeII in CT interactions with surrounding atoms (Supplementary Fig.\u00a020), it has an extra unpaired electron in its 3d orbitals in both LS and IS states, while the accepted electrons are mainly transferred into its 4S orbital in HS state. As a consequence, this extra unpaired electron in the 3d orbitals of FeII, which is observed in both LS and IS states, is the reason of the appearance of the EPR signal at 2.02\u2009g. Moreover, due to the transfer of electrons from hybrid orbitals of the neighboring atoms into LP and LP* hybrid orbitals, NBO charges on the FeII cation in LS and IS states are 0.586 e and 0.542 e, respectively.", "In both spin states, NBO analysis detects three CT interactions of the LP O\u2009\u2192\u2009LP* Fe type in pairs of Ala132\u2013Fe, Wt56\u2013Fe, and Wt89\u2013Fe as well as the LP C\u03b41\u2009\u2192\u2009LP* Fe interaction in Ile145\u2013Fe pair (Supplementary Table\u00a03). Among them, the LP (2) O Wt89 \u2192 LP* (4) FeII interaction with an E(2) of 13.22\u2009kJ\u2009mol\u22121 and a qCT of 0.0302 e is the strongest CT interaction inside the FeII\u2013binding site of Cpz10. The LP (1) O Ala132 \u2192 LP* (6) FeII is the second strong CT interaction of FeII. Thus, these two interactions play important roles in the electron transfer process within the FeII\u2013binding site. It is evident (Supplementary Data\u00a03) that the FeIII not only involves in much more CT interactions than the FeII, but also it interacts more strongly with its neighboring atoms within the Cpz10 active site.", "In vivo study using the cpz10-deletion mutant", "To validate the function of Cpz10 in vivo, an in-frame cpz10-deletion mutant was prepared. The 34.7\u2009kb cpz biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was cloned into pMKBAC02 to give pMKBAC02-CPZ-Int (Supplementary Fig.\u00a021). In vitro CRISPR/Cas9 was performed to edit pMKBAC02- CPZ-Int to overcome the high GC content of Streptomyces albus J1074::ErmE*-crpsc54. Both pMKBAC02- CPZ-Int and pMKBAC02-Cpz-Int\u2206cpz10 were individually integrated into the genome of Streptomyces albus J1074 for heterologous expression of Cpz or Cpz\u2206cpz10 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a022)55. Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC\u2013MS) analysis identified three Cpz aglycones respectively with molecular weights at m/z 930, 944, and 958 in consistence with previous reports (Supplementary Fig.\u00a023)14. The caprazamycin production was totally abolished in the \u2206cpz10 mutant in contrast to that in Cpz-containing species where caprazamycin is produced. \u2206cpz10 was cultured in a scale of 30 litters, from which only was one compound (2\u2009mg) purified (Supplementary Scheme\u00a01) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a024 and Supplementary Note\u00a01)4,12,14,20,56. This compound was subjected to MS and NMR analysis, confirming that it is an ADR-GlyU disaccharide species (compound 13, where both C6\u2032 amine and C7\u2019 carboxyl groups are methylated) instead of the expected compound 11. The chemical structure resolved is unexpected, while it is very informative pertaining to the cyclization of the seven-membered diazepanone ring. Our reasoning is that both the C6\u2032 amine and the C7\u2019 amide group of the diazepanone ring is methylated by the action of the same N-methyltransferase (Cpz11 or 26) while the methylation at the C7\u2019 amide group takes place after the ring closure (envisioning that both secondary \u03b1-amines have a similar spatial geometry and the ring is rotatable at C5\u2019 allowing molecular recognition by the same enzyme). The C7\u2019 carboxyl group, on the other hand, is methylated by the action of the O-methyltransferase (the remaining Cpz11 or 26), of which the resulting methoxyl group turns out to be a good leaving group for the subsequent ring cyclization to take place. This process differs from the canonical amino acid adenylation by reacting with ATP and the \u03b2-hydroxyl group appears to be critical for the ring to cyclize. The isolation of compound 13 further suggests that the proposed ribosyltransferase Cpz17 can transfer ADR onto compounds 11 and 12, while the confirmation is beyond the scope of this study. Next, Cpz10 was examined against compound 13, which, however, cannot be consumed by Cpz10, suggesting that it is not a substrate of Cpz10. Next, Cpz10 was examined against compound 14 (produced by Cpz27, see below), which was proposed the substrate in the biosynthesis of muraymycin and polyoxin. Again, we did not find any new product4,20, concluding that both compounds 13 and 14 are not the substrates of Cpz10 in contradiction to the biosynthetic pathways proposed previously4,20 (Supplementary Scheme\u00a02).", "Cpz27 is responsible for phosphorylation of compound 13", "In silico analysis, the cpz BGC holds two genes cpz12 and cpz27 both coding for kinase-like proteins (Supplementary Fig.\u00a025). cpz27 contains a walker ATP motif (GXXGXGKS/T) in opposite to cpz12 that does not; cpz27 also shows 24% protein sequence identity to tunicamycin-resistance protein (TmrD)57. To elucidate their biochemical roles, we cloned and expressed both genes in Streptomyces lividans TK64 given as E. coli was not an appropriate host for these two proteins (Supplementary Fig.\u00a026). Both gene products were purified from Streptomyces cultures and examined against compound 13 or tunicamycin. None of them accepts tunicamycin, while can only compound 13 be phosphorylated by Cpz27 to form compound 14 at the expense of one molecule of ATP (Fig.\u00a02D, Fig.\u00a03E and Supplementary Fig.\u00a027). However, we could not isolate compound 14 from the culture of \u2206cpz10 likely due to low yield and/or high instability. As mention above, compounds 13 and 14 are not substrates of Cpz10 at odds with previous reports4,20, where muraymycin, capuramycin and caprazamycin are phosphorylated at the corresponding position to abolish their antimicrobial activity (as a mechanism of self-resistance)5,12,58. In the present study, this likelihood is low (see below) but still cannot be ruled out. Alternatively, the 3\u2033-OH phosphorylation as a reaction switch was proposed in control of the reaction order4,20,59. To know if the phosphorylation is a reaction switch (it takes place before ring cyclization or at the late-stage products), we purified caprazamycins and prepared compound 8 from the pMKBAC02-CPZ-Int containing Streptomyces. Biochemical examination revealed that neither is the substrate of Cpz27, confirming that the phosphorylation takes place before the heterocyclic ring cyclization. As a result, Cpz27 is a phosphotransferase controlling the reaction order but is irrelevant to 7-membered ring cyclization. On the other hand, Mur23 a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent decarboxylate (Supplementary Fig.\u00a028) was reported catalyzing decarboxylation of 3\u2033-phospho-6\u2032-N-2-aminobutanoyl-ADR-GlyU20, where the 3\u2033-phosphate is considered essential as Mur23 cannot react without it (Supplementary Scheme\u00a03). This notion does not agree with our result as Mur23 is capable of decarboxylating compound 11 (without the 3\u2033-phosphate group) to compound 15 (molecular ion (M\u2009+\u2009H)+ at m/z\u2009=\u2009375.05 by 44) (Figs.\u00a02C and 3F). Additionally, Mur23 was first assayed in the presence of compound 13, then it was assayed in conjunction with Cpz27 against compound 14. Whichever the condition there is no new peak emerged, suggesting compounds 13 and 14 are not the substrate of Mur23 (Fig.\u00a02C). Taken together, the decarboxylation is independent of phosphorylation, which likely takes place after \u03b2-hydroxylation, methylation but prior to ring cyclization (Supplementary Fig.\u00a029). Given the existence of muraymycin D4 (ref.\u200960), one should agree that the decarboxylation of compound 11 is independent of the ADR moiety. Mur19 (the ADR transferase), however, cannot transform muraymycin D4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01) to muraymycin D2 as well as compound 15 to ADR-15 in the presence of UDP-ADR, suggesting that ribosylation takes place prior to decarboxylation. Plus, one previous report showed that Mur23 is incapable of decarboxylating compound 16 (without the 3\u2033-phosphoryl group; Supplementary Fig.\u00a01), indicating both ADR and 3\u2033-phosphate groups are critical20. These results somehow conflict each other, not least at odds with our result. This inconsistence is indeed not yet reconciled but awaits further clarification in the future."]
