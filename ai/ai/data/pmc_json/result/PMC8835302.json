["2. Results", "2.1. Deep Functional Profiling of Microbiomes of Wild Animals", "Previously, an ultrahigh-throughput microfluidic platform was applied to select the most active bacterial antagonists from the human microbiome [18]. In this study, this technology was adopted to select bacterial antagonists from the microbiomes of different wild animals. It was assumed that living in the wild provides additional selective pressure on wild animal microbiomes, promoting them to serve as first-line gates for pathogen invasion. Since wound licking does not result in regular acute sepsis events, it was suggested that animal bacterial communities may contain probiotic bacteria protecting hosts from pathogens. Microbiomes of wild animals, including the skin beetle (Dermestes maculatus), Siberian lynx (Lynx lynx wrangeli), common raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), and East Siberian brown bear (Ursus arctos collaris) were investigated to select the most active probiotic strains using an ultrahigh-throughput microfluidic platform (Figure 1).", "Staphylococcus aureus was used as a model pathogen to select bacterial killers, abolishing its growth in coculture. Single-cell cocultivation of bacteria from microbiomes of wild animals with the reporter S. aureus strain in microfluidic droplets was followed by isolation of S. aureus killers by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of droplet microcompartments occupied by S. aureus antagonists. The selected bacteria were regenerated from droplets and screened for anti-S. aureus activity, and the most efficient bacterial antagonists were collected for further characterization by genomics and metabolomics. Repeated isolation of B. pumilus strains with prominent S. aureus antagonism was observed using this platform. B. pumilus represented ~0.5\u20132% of the culturable component of wild animal microbiomes.", "2.2. Biosynthetic Fingerprint of Isolated B. pumilus Strains", "Isolated B. pumilus strains demonstrated different phenotypes (colony morphology and mobility) that may be associated with their different ecological microenvironments in their hosts. Whole-genome sequencing was applied to understand the biosynthetic potential of representative B. pumilus strains (Figure 2A).", "Despite different phenotypes observed and specific BGCs detected, e.g., lantibiotics in B. pumilus P1 strain, genome mining revealed a common set of BGCs characteristic of antagonistic B. pumilus strains (Figure 2B). BGCs of the antibiotic Ami [19,22] and siderophore bacillibactin [28] were detected in their genomes. Moreover, a number of BGCs encoding putative analogs of antimicrobials, including bacilysin [29], class IId cyclical bacteriocin, surfactin [30], and desferrioxamine, were detected.", "2.3. Antagonistic Properties of B. pumilus Strains", "An agar overlay assay was performed to estimate the activity spectrum of selected probiotic strains (Figure 3). B. subtilis 168 was used as a negative control since it has impaired secondary metabolite biosynthesis resulting from inactive 4-phosphopantetheinyl transferase [31].", "All the selected strains efficiently inhibited the growth of Gram-positive non-spore-forming bacteria, displaying mediocre activity against Gram-negative strains (Figure 3A,B). Large clearance zones were observed for various Staphylococcus species (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus), Lactococcus lactis, Macrococcus caseolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Aerococcus viridans, and Escherichia coli \u0394tolC. A less pronounced inhibitory effect was detected for Enterococcus faecium, E. coli BL21, and Citrobacter koseri. Small diffusive zones of growth inhibition were observed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. No clearance zones were detected for Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Salmonella enterica, and Serratia marcenscens. B. pumilus D10 demonstrated the most prominent antagonistic activity on agar plates (Figure 3A,B).", "The antagonistic properties of B. pumilus strains generally correlated with the Ami activity spectrum reported previously [20]. Activity-based metabolomic analysis revealed that Ami was the only antibiotic component mediating the bactericidal effect against S. aureus in culture media of B. pumilus D10, P1, E14, and 124. Amicoumacin B (AmiB) and amicoumacin C (AmiC) resulting from Ami lactonization (AmiC) followed by hydrolysis (AmiB) were also detected as inactive metabolites of Ami (Figures S1\u2013S4). The selected strains were compared based on their level of Ami production (Figure 3C). B. pumilus strains showed maximum Ami production after 60 h of cultivation. B. pumilus D10 produced the highest concentrations of Ami.", "Cocultivation of the probiotic B. pumilus D10 strain with model reporter pathogens S. aureus and E. coli was provided using different target: effector ratios to detail its antagonistic landscape (Figure 4 and Figure S5). Reporter strains producing fluorescent proteins enabled time-resolved detecting of growth inhibition.", "A fluorescence level above 20% of the maximal was observed for the control B. subtilis 168 even at low target: effector ratios (Figure 4A,C). Similar effects were observed for coculturing of S. aureus and E. coli cells (Figure S5). We associate this effect with the competition of microorganisms for nutrients. Unlike B. subtilis 168, B. pumilus D10 efficiently inhibited the growth of reporter bacteria (Figure 4B,D). The effect of cocultivation on the target bacteria was more complex than the effect of pure Ami. While it is impossible to eradicate E. coli cells using Ami alone, as little as 104 CFU/mL B. pumilus D10 provided detectable eradication of both S. aureus and E. coli within the first 24 h. The outstanding efficacy of the probiotic B. pumilus in coculture is essential for their ecology. Apparently, it is associated with the additional biosynthetic arsenal reported previously. We suggest that the additional secondary metabolites either potentiate Ami or increase the permeability of target cells toward Ami.", "2.4. Biodiversity of Ami Clusters", "The results obtained indicate a high impact of Ami-producing strains on bacterial communities. Genome mining of Ami clusters provided a detailed description of their natural landscape (Figure 5).", "Generally, Ami clusters were identified in numerous Bacilli and could be subdivided into three main families characteristic of (i) B. pumilus type (B. pumilus, B. altitudinis, B. safensis, B. stratosphericus, B. zhangzhouensis, Priestia endophytica), (ii) B. subtilis type (B. subtilis, B. bingmayongensis, B. rugosus, B. atrophaeus, B. inaquosorum, B. vallismortis, B. swezeyi), and (iii) Paenibacillus type (P. dendritiformis, P. solani, P. lautus, P. apiaries, P. thiaminolyticus, P. bouchesdurhonensis, P. lentus) (Figure 5A and Figure S6). An Ami cluster was also identified in the rare genome of Paludifilum halophilum, indicating that Ami production may be observed for some Thermoactinomycetaceae. A closely related BGC of antibiotic zwittermicin A (ZmA) was frequently identified in B. cereus and B. thuringiensis genomes. The key hybrid PKS/NRPS enzyme AmiI encoded the structural fragment that differed between Ami and ZmA (Figure 5D). That enabled distinguishing between Ami clusters and related ZmA clusters (Figure 5B,C). ZmaK is an AmiI homolog in the ZmA cluster with a protein identity < 40%. Identical chemical structures were previously reported for B. pumilus and B. subtilis-type clusters, despite them having a protein identity of about 60% [19,22]. Hence, we propose a similar structure for products of Paenibacillus-type Ami-like BGCs with a synonymous modular organization (Figure 5C).", "Ami transport and self-resistance mechanisms differ between Bacillus and Paenibacillus. Kinase AmiN and phosphatase AmiO are located downstream of the Ami cluster core, mediating Ami inactivation and reactivation, respectively [19,32]. Kinase AmiN is conservative in B. pumilus, B. subtilis, and Paludifilum-type clusters going in the same orientation as core Ami cluster genes (Figure S6). Phosphatase AmiO is not essential for Ami clusters in Priestia endophytica and Paludifilum halophilum, indicating that alternative phosphatases in genomes of these bacteria are involved in Ami dephosphorylation. AmiO has the opposite orientation in the majority of B. pumilus and B. subtilis-type clusters, while direct orientation and transposon flanking were observed in a minor population of distant clusters (Figure S2). That may indicate the evolution of cluster regulation and compactization. Homologs of kinase AmiN and phosphatase AmiO were not detected in Paenibacillus-type Ami-like BGCs. Instead, putative methyltransferase and acetyltransferase were detected downstream of the core Ami cluster genes (Figure 5C and Figure S6). We suggest their involvement in self-resistance since it was reported that acetyltransferases mediate self-resistance in Ami-producing Xenorhabdus bovienii [33] and a related ZmA cluster [34]. Similarly, a transporter AmiP located upstream of core genes of the Ami cluster was not detected in Paenibacillus-type Ami-like BGCs (Figure 5C and Figure S6). Instead, a putative C39 peptidase-containing protein was conservatively found upstream of the Ami cluster core in Paenibacillus-type Ami-like BGCs. We propose its involvement in transport/deacetylation in Paenibacillus-type BGCs."]
