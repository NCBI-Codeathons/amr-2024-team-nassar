["Results", "Preparation and complementation of the S. clavuligerus \u0394cpe::apra and \u0394cpe-INF deletion mutants", "In S. clavuligerus, cpe (orf12) and orf13 are transcribed together as a polycistronic mRNA and the stop codon of cpe also overlaps with the start codon of orf13 [23]. In addition, there is a 48 bp overlap between the 3' ends of orf13 and orf14, which are encoded on opposite DNA strands (Fig 2A). Therefore, there is potential for polar effects on the expression (transcription and/or translation) of orf13 in a cpe gene mutant, depending on how it was prepared. To test this hypothesis, two different cpe mutants (Table 1) were prepared using the ReDirect two-step protocol [34]. In the first mutant, the apramycin (apra) cassette flanked by FLP recombinase target (FRT) sites from the plasmid pIJ773 was used to delete an internal region of cpe (39 bp from the 5' end to 39 bp from the 3' end), leading to the S. clavuligerus \u0394cpe::apra mutant (Fig 2B). The apra gene was inserted in the orientation opposite to cpe transcription to maximize the potential for polar effects on the expression of downstream genes. For preparing the second mutant, the apra cassette was excised from the \u0394cpe::apra mutant and replaced with an 81 bp scar sequence in the correct reading frame to give the S. clavuligerus \u0394cpe-INF (in frame deletion) mutant (Fig 2B), which has the least potential for producing polar effects on the expression of the downstream genes. The prepared mutants were verified by genomic DNA PCR and were complemented using the cpe gene from S. clavuligerus (cpeSc) expressed under the control of the constitutive ermE* promoter (ermEp*) in the plasmid pHM11a (Table 2). Wild-type and cpe mutant strains of S. clavuligerus containing either pHM11a (control) or pHM:cpeSc were grown in SA medium for up to 120 hours to assess for clavulanic acid production. Bioassays and HPLC analysis of culture supernatants demonstrated that both the S. clavuligerus \u0394cpe::apra and \u0394cpe-INF mutants were completely blocked in clavulanic acid production when compared to the wt strain (Fig 2C). Introduction of pHM:cpeSc restored clavulanic acid production to 60%-70% of wt levels in both mutants (Fig 2D), suggesting that the cpe disruption(s) was not associated with any significant polarity. The marker-less S. clavuligerus \u0394cpe-INF mutant was chosen for further analysis in the current study.", "Cellular localization of CpeSc and its influence on the expression of other genes from the clavulanic acid biosynthetic gene cluster of S. clavuligerus", "The CpeSc protein shares many sequence and structural similarities with class A \u03b2-lactamases, but it has been shown to lack any detectable \u03b2-lactamase activity under in vitro conditions [25]. Most bona fide \u03b2-lactamases are secreted proteins that inactivate \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in the periplasm, the site of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and crosslinking [39]. However, the predicted amino acid sequence of CpeSc does not contain any detectable secretion signals, warranting further investigation into its exact cellular location in S. clavuligerus. C-terminal FLAG (CpeSc-FLAG) and 6\u00d7His (CpeSc-6\u00d7His) epitope-tagged copies of the protein were separately expressed in wt S. clavuligerus using the constitutive ermEp* from plasmid pHM11a (Table 2). As controls for protein localization studies, S. clavuligerus strains expressing C-terminal FLAG-tagged copies of known cytoplasmic (CcaRFLAG) [40] and secreted (BlipFLAG) [41] proteins were also prepared separately (Table 2). S. clavuligerus strains expressing FLAG-tagged copies of the respective proteins were grown in SA medium for 48 hours for isolating different cellular protein fractions. Mycelial pellets were used to obtain cytoplasmic and cell wall-associated fractions, whereas enriched secreted fractions were prepared by using salt to precipitate soluble proteins from culture supernatants. Western blot analysis of different cellular fractions using anti-FLAG polyclonal antibodies demonstrated that CpeSc-FLAG was only detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig 3). As expected, the CcarRFLAG and BlipFLAG controls were detected in cytoplasmic and secreted fractions, respectively (Fig 3). In addition, cultures of S. clavuligerus expressing CpeSc-6\u00d7His were also used for isolating fractions for western analysis, which confirmed that CpeSc is a cytoplasmic protein (S1 Fig). During the described western blot analysis, the size of epitope tagged CpeSc was determined to be ~54 kDa based on the signal obtained using anti-FLAG and anti-6\u00d7His antibodies (S1 Fig). This corresponded to the size of 6\u00d7His-tagged CpeSc heterologously expressed and purified from E. coli, which was used as a control (S1 Fig).", "10.1371/journal.pone.0215960.g003Fig 3Cellular localization of Cpe in S. clavuligerus.C-terminal FLAG-tagged copies of Cpe, secreted Blip and cytoplasmic CcaR were expressed in wt S. clavuligerus separately for western blot analysis.

In addition, CpeSc is located in the cytoplasm of S. clavuligerus (Fig 3), and cpe mutants are completely blocked in clavulanic acid production (Fig 2C). This raised the possibility that the protein could have a role in functioning as a cytoplasmic sensor/receptor for clavulanic acid or related metabolites to indirectly regulate production under in vivo conditions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression level of the first gene from each transcriptional unit (Fig 4A) from the clavulanic acid gene cluster of S. clavuligerus in the \u0394cpe-INF mutant and compared it with that from the wt strain (Fig 4B). RT-PCR analysis showed that only expression of the cpe gene was altered in the comparison, which was expected (Fig 4B). The analysis also demonstrated that the \u0394cpe-INF mutation is not associated with any transcriptional polarity as the expression of orf13 was unaffected in the strain. Therefore, it is clear that the deletion of cpe does not in any way influence the expression of other genes from the clavulanic acid gene cluster in S. clavuligerus.", "10.1371/journal.pone.0215960.g004Fig 4Transcriptional analysis of genes from the clavulanic acid biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in wt S. clavuligerus and the \u0394cpe-INF mutant.(A) The overall architecture of the BGC is shown with each hollow arrow representing a gene and the arrowhead its orientation.

It was also shown that the C-terminal domain was responsible for the observed in vitro cephalosporin esterase activity of CpeSc, but a function or phenotype could not be assigned at the time for the N-terminal domain based on the assays used [25]. Results from the western blot analysis described above indicate that CpeSc does not undergo posttranslational processed in S. clavuligerus, but it is not known if the N-terminal domain is required for the activity of the protein in the native host. To investigate the in vivo roles of the N- and C-terminal domains during clavulanic acid biosynthesis, three additional CpeSc expression constructs were prepared for analysis. The N- and C-terminal domains were expressed separately or together (as separate polypeptides, Table 2) in complementation studies using the S. clavuligerus \u0394cpe-INF mutant. Analysis of SA and soy culture supernatants showed that except for full-length CpeSc, none of the other expression plasmids restored clavulanic acid production in the \u0394cpe-INF mutant, suggesting that both domains need to be part of a single polypeptide for biosynthesis to occur (Fig 5A and S2 Fig). Since the 5S clavams are not produced by wt S. clavuligerus when grown in SA medium [42], soy cultures were included in the analysis. Results showed that none of the strains accumulated any of the known intermediates from the clavulanic acid arm of the pathway (Fig 1 and S4 Table), and production of the 5S clavams was also unaffected in all of them when cultured in soy medium (S5 Table).", "10.1371/journal.pone.0215960.g005Fig 5Functional analysis of different domains of CpeSc and its homologues during clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus.(A and B) LC-MS analysis of 96 hour SA culture supernatants after imidazole derivatization using the ammonium bicarbonate buffer system [38].

Whereas other studies have shown that S. jumonjinensis and S. katsurahamanus can also produce clavulanic acid [12], but details regarding the sequences of their respective gene clusters are unavailable [14]. Therefore, we amplified the cpe homologues from the four organisms using genomic DNA as a template for complementation studies, and we also determined the complete sequence of the genes from S. jumonjinensis and S. katsurahamanus (S3 Fig). The predicted amino acid sequences of the Cpe proteins from S. jumonjinensis (CpeSj) and S. katsurahamanus (CpeSk) share ~68% identity with Cpe from S. clavuligerus (CpeSc) (S4 Fig). In comparison, the predicted sequences of the proteins from S. flavogriseus (CpeSf) and S. viridis (CpeSv) showed 58.8% and 48.8% identity to CpeSc, respectively. The predicted C-terminal domains of all four proteins contain the characteristic class A \u03b2-lactamase SXXK and SDN catalytic motifs, whereas the KTG motif was replaced by KGG in the non-producers (S. flavogriseus and S. viridis) and KAG in the producers (S. clavuligerus, S. jumonjinensis and S. katsurahamanus), respectively (S4 Fig). In addition, all proteins also contained an extra N-terminal domain resembling that of CpeSc to different extents.", "Sequence analysis showed that the Cpe proteins from clavulanic acid producers are more closely related to each other as compared to those from the non-producers (S4 and S5 Figs). To determine the significance of this finding, the respective cpe genes from different sources were expressed under the control of ermEp* in the S. clavuligerus \u0394cpe-INF mutant for complementation studies (Table 2). It was found that Cpe from S. jumonjinensis and S. katsurahamanus restored clavulanic acid production in the S. clavuligerus \u0394cpe-INF mutant to varying degrees (Fig 5A and 5B), whereas no complementation was observed in the case of CpeSv and CpeSf. Therefore, only the cpe genes from clavulanic acid producers (CpeSj and CpeSk) seem to be functionally equivalent to the known homologue from S. clavuligerus during clavulanic acid biosynthesis.", "Identification of amino acid residues from CpeSc required for clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus", "The crystal structure of CpeSc revealed that two molecules of clavulanic acid (CA-1 and CA-2, respectively) bind to the monomeric protein [25]. CA-1 binds to an active site pocket to form hydrogen bonds with Lys89, Tyr359 and Arg418 and its C2 side chain carboxylate is positioned deep in the active site of CpeSc, where it interacts with Lys375 [25]. Lys375 is part of the CpeSc\nKTG motif, where the equivalent catalytic residues in PBPs/\u03b2-lactamases also interact with the analogous carboxylates from penicillin and cephalosporin substrates, respectively [43]. In comparison, binding of CA-2 occurs in a mostly hydrophobic cleft comprised of Trp91, Leu362, Leu415, Arg418 and Ala422 at the interface of the N- and C-terminal domains [25]. The Trp91 and Arg418 residues are also highly conserved in the other predicted Cpe proteins (CpeSj, CpeSk, CpeSf, CpeSv), where Arg418 from CpeSc is also involved in binding to CA-1 (S4 Fig). Therefore, Lys89, Trp91 Tyr359, Lys375 and Arg418 from CpeSc were selected for mutagenesis studies to examine their in vivo contributions during the clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus. The cpeSc gene along with the ermEp* was transferred from pHM:cpeSc to pSET152 and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis, and the prepared cpeSc variants were assessed for their ability to complement the S. clavuligerus \u0394cpe-INF mutant. Replacement of Lys89, Tyr359, Lys375 or Arg418 with Ala individually in CpeSc led to a complete loss in clavulanic acid production (Table 3 and S6 Fig). However, when Lys375 was replaced with arginine (both being basic amino acids), clavulanic acid production was restored to 40% production levels in the \u0394cpe-INF mutant as compared to the wt strain (Table 3 and S6 Fig). As well, partial complementation was also observed in the case of the CpeSc Trp91Ala variant (Table 3).", "Clavulanic acid production in wild type (wt) S. clavuligerus and the \u0394cpe-INF mutant expressing different variants of CpeSc.", "S. clavuligerus straina CpeSc protein variantb(cpeSc codon substitution) Bioactivityc.", "SA soy.", "wt NA ++++ +++++.", "\u0394cpe-INF NA - -.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET-152) NA - -.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc) wt (none) +++ ++++.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc- Ser27Ala) Ser27Ala (TCC\u2192GCC) +++ ++++.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Lys89Ala) Lys89Ala (AAG\u2192GCG) - -.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Trp91Ala) Trp91Ala (TGG\u2192GCG) ++ +++.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Arg115Ala) Arg115Ala (CGC\u2192GCC) +++ ++++.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Ser173Ala) Ser173Ala (TCG\u2192GCG) - -.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Lys176Ala) Lys176Ala (AAG\u2192GCG) - -.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Ser206Ala) Ser206Ala (AGC\u2192GCC) +++ ++++.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Ser234Ala) Ser234Ala (AGC\u2192GCC) - -.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Arg311Ala) Arg311Ala (CGC\u2192GCC) +++ ++++.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Gln321Ala) Gln321Ala (CAG\u2192GCG) +++ ++++.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Trp326Ala) Trp326Ala (TGG\u2192GCG) +++ ++++.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Arg346Ala) Arg346Ala (CGG\u2192GCG) +++ ++++.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Tyr359Ala) Tyr359Ala (TAC\u2192GCC) - -.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Lys375Ala) Lys375Ala (AAG\u2192GCG) - -.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Lys375Arg) Lys375Arg (AAG\u2192AGG) ++ +++.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Ser378Ala) Ser378Ala (TCC\u2192GCC) - -.", "\u0394cpe-INF (pSET:cpeSc-Arg418Ala) Arg418Ala (CGC\u2192GCC) - -.", "a Strains of S. clavuligerus were fermented in either SA or soy media for 96 hours and culture supernatants were used in bioassays for detecting clavulanic acid production.", "b Single amino acid variants of CpeSc used in the analysis are shown and the corresponding codon changes in cpeSc leading to the respective substitutions are indicated in parenthesis; NA, Not applicable.", "c Zones of inhibition relative the wt strain grown in each media are indicated, where (+) indicates clavulanic acid production and (-) indicates the lack of production, respectively.", "Other amino acids from CpeSc have also been shown to interact with clavulanic acid, some of which contributed to its in vitro cephalosporin esterase activity [25].

Valeg\u00e5rd, et al. reported that the CpeSc Ser173Ala mutant showed a 100-fold reduction in esterase activity, whereas the Ser234Ala and Ser378A mutants were not affected to the same extent [25]. Since the roles of the respective amino acids during clavulanic acid are not known, Ser173, Lys176, Ser234, Ser378 were also individually substituted with Ala in CpeSc for in vivo analysis. All four variants were unable to complement the \u0394cpe-INF mutant, demonstrating that they essential for clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus (Table 3 and S6 Fig).", "In the current analysis, amino acids were also identified that are either highly and/or partially conserved in all five Cpe proteins (S4 Fig). These include the Ser27, Arg115, Ser206, Arg311, Gln321, Trp326 and Arg346 from CpeSc, which are not part of any conserved motif and do not interact with clavulanic acid directly based on the reported crystal structure of the protein (29). When each of these residues was replaced with Ala, the respective CpeSc variants restored clavulanic acid production in the S. clavuligerus \u0394cpe-INF mutant to varying degrees (Table 3), demonstrating that they are not essential for production. Overall, a detailed set of residues were identified in CpeSc, some of which contribute to both the in vitro and in vivo activities of the protein, whereas others are only relevant during the latter process. These are important findings as they allude to the actual biochemical role/function of the protein, which occurs during in vivo clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus"]
