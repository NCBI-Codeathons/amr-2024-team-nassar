["RESULTS", "Self-resistance genes allocated within the cosmomycin D cluster.", "Analysis of the COSD biosynthetic gene cluster, located at contig 2 of the genome assembly of S. olindensis (JJOH00000002.1), enabled the assignment of each gene based on their homology to genes coding for proteins of known functions. The genes cosI (DF19_23560), cosJ (DF19_23565), cosP (DF19_23570), and cosU (DF19_23575) were identified as four candidate genes that might play a role concerning self-resistance. The products of cosI and cosJ are part of a superfamily of transport proteins (ABC transporters) that is one of the largest groups of proteins in nature (18). In detail, cosI codes for a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The amino acid sequence encoded by cosI shows the same features found in the prototypal anthracycline resistance protein DrrA from S. peucetius, such as the Walker A motif, Q loop, signature motif, Walker B motif, switch region, GATE (glycine loop and transducer element) domain, and DEF motif (19). This component is associated with transmembrane proteins that are responsible for the formation of pores through which substances are transported, known as transmembrane domains (TMDs) (20). The analysis of the product of cosJ shows a typical conformation of the TMD, composed of alpha helices organized as homodimers (21). Both proteins form part of the ABC transporter complex, which has 95.14% identity to the ABC transporter of Streptomyces purpurascens (accession numbers WP_189725841.1 and WP_189725842.1, respectively) (Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). For CosJ, six transmembrane helices, forming a transmembrane domain, can be predicted using Phyre and TMHMM (Fig. S1).", "In close proximity to cosI and cosJ, cosP could be identified as another plausible resistance determinant. It encodes an enzyme (accession number KDN80073.1) that shows 88.34% identity on the amino acid level with the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) from S. purpurascens (accession number GHA30648.1). Although proteins of this kind are commonly annotated as glutathione peroxidases, those in actinobacteria in fact represent mycothiol peroxidases, as enzymatically demonstrated in the protein with accession number ASW14906.1 from Corynebacterium glutamicum (17).", "Besides the gene encoding KDN80073.1, there is a second gene annotated with this function in the genome, with locus tag DF19_33265, which is found in contig 4 (JJOH00000004.1) and encodes the protein with accession number KDN79115.1. When we compared both proteins with the MPx of C. glutamicum (accession number ASW14906.1), KDN79115.1 showed a higher identity level (53.21%) than CosP (KDN80073.1) (43.4%), which resulted in higher values for the BLAST score and E value, which were, respectively, 175 and 2e\u221257 for KDN79115.1 and 139 and 3e\u221243 for KDN80073.1. When KDN80073.1 and KDN79115.1 were compared, they shared 55.1% identity.", "Searching selected Streptomyces reference genomes for annotated GPx or MPx genes, we found in general only one ortholog per genome, such as those that encode the proteins with accession numbers CAB88451.1 in S. coelicolor strain A3(2), WP_010985209.1 in S. avermitilis, WP_100106014.1 in S. peucetius subsp. caesius strain ATCC 27952, and EFL32854.1 in Streptomyces viridochromogenes strain DSM 40736 (Fig. S3). To understand how both annotated peroxidases of S. olindensis correlate with these proteins and with the remaining members of the GPx family in Pfam (accession number PF00255), similarity sequence networks (SSNs) were constructed.", "Since KDN80073.1 was not in the UniProt database, first a small SSN with 100 proteins, denominated \u201cseed,\u201d was generated with the Enzyme Similarity Tool (22) and the FASTA sequence of KDN80073.1 (Fig. S5), with the aim of identifying close relatives of KDN80073.1 within the GPx family in Pfam. Since an identity level of 60% or higher was assumed to be sufficient to identify isofunctional protein clusters (22), we chose a level of 70% identity as the threshold in the seed SSN, where cluster 2 contained KDN80073.1 and a further 12 members, listed in Table S2.", "A first SSN of Pfam family PF00255 was obtained using a threshold of about 55% similarity (Fig. S6); a large main cluster of 39,799 peroxidases included almost all actinobacterial proteins, together with those from other phyla, including known prokaryotic (e.g., BtuE of Escherichia coli [accession number P06610]) and eukaryotic (e.g., GPx1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [accession number P36014]) GPx proteins. When the threshold was increased to a similarity level of about 61% in a second PF00255 SSN, the actinobacterial proteins grouped in different clusters. Cluster 2 comprised 3,261 proteins and included the proteins with accession numbers CAB88451.1, WP_010985209.1, WP_100106014.1, and EFL32854.1; however, cluster 99 had almost the same composition as seed SSN cluster 2, excluding only KDN80073.1 (Fig. S7 and Table S2), which is not in the PF00255 database.", "Subsequently, a genome neighborhood network (GNN) was generated from that SSN (Fig. S8). The analysis of cluster 99 revealed that all members were in non-previously described cosmomycin clusters of different Streptomyces species. These findings could suggest that KDN80073.1 has an increased specificity for some peroxides generated by cosmomycin action.", "The third putative resistance mechanism is encoded by cosU, whose product shows 96.71% similarity to the excinuclease ABC subunit UvrA of Streptomyces janthinus (accession number WP_193483046) (Fig. S4), which is a member of a group of proteins associated with DNA repair (10, 23). The prototype of this group is DrrC from S. peucetius, which could bind to daunorubicin intercalated to DNA and displace anthracycline, thereby preventing nucleic acid damage and allowing the drug to be expelled by the DrrA/-B system (23).", "Self-resistance mechanisms are essential for S. olindensis when challenged with DOX and COSD.", "To understand the toxicity of COSD compared with that of pure DOX, COSD was isolated from S. olindensis using analytical fractionation. The fraction of interest showed a red-purple color. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) measurements revealed a candidate compound with protonated molecular masses of m/z 1,189.5901 ([M\u00a0+\u00a0H]+, calculated 1,189.590149, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.04\u2009ppm) and m/z 595.2991 ([M\u2009+\u20092H]2+, calculated 595.298713, \u0394 = +0.65\u2009ppm), which were consistent with the molecular formula of COSD (C60H88N2O22) (Fig.\u00a01). A complementary tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of COSD, executed on its [M\u2009+\u20092H]2+ ion, produced fragment ions that were in full agreement with the expected structure (Fig. S9 and Table S1).", "FIG\u00a01(A) Chemical structures of doxorubicin (DOX) and cosmomycin D (COSD).

We evaluated the peroxidase activity of both enzymes by ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange (FOX) assay to quantify H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) reduction within a time frame of 180\u00a0s. The WT MPx consumed the majority of H2O2 within 15\u00a0s, whereas the C38S mutant enzyme remained catalytically inactive, demonstrated by a constant amount of H2O2 remaining in the assay over the time used.
