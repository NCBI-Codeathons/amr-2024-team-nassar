["Results", "Structure Identification", "In the present study, three metabolites (Figure 1) were isolated from the fermented supernatant of X. nematophila YL001. Their structures were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MS spectra. According to the relevant spectral data reported, the three compounds were identified as nematophin (NEP-1, Supplementary Figures S5\u2013S8) (Li et al., 1997a), hexahydropyrrolo[1, 2-\u03b1]pyrazine-1,4-dione (PDKP, Supplementary Figures S9\u2013S12) (Bishay et al., 2018) and 1,4-dimethyl-3-(2-methylpropyl)-6-(phenylmethyl)-2,5-piperazinedione (MDKP, Supplementary Figures S13\u2013S15) (Nakao et al., 2016), respectively. They are dipeptide compounds in structure. Referring to the existing optical rotation data, the absolute stereostructures of PDKP and MDKP were determined as (8\u03b1S)-hexahydropyrrolo[1, 2-\u03b1]pyrazine-1,4-dione [cyclo(L-Pro-Gly)] (Campbell et al., 2009) and (3S, 6S)-1,4-dimethyl-3-(2-methylpropyl)-6-(phenylmethyl)-2,5-piperazinedione [N, N\u2032-dimethyl-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Leu)] (Nakao et al., 2016), respectively.", "To confirm the stereo structure of NEP-1, an enantiomeric mixture of nematophin (NEP-2, Supplementary Figures S16\u2013S19) and its (S)-configuration structure (NEP-3, Supplementary Figures S25\u2013S28) were synthesized and characterized in this study. Their circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. An obvious positive absorption band was observed from 300 to 400 nm for the NEP-3 solution. Interestingly, no absorption signals were detected in this wavelength range for both NEP-1 and NEP-2 solutions. Moreover, different from NEP-1 and NEP-2 of racemic property, NEP-3 also exhibited a specific rotation \u03b1D25 value of 31.66 (c 0.58) in CHCl3. These findings indicate that NEP-1 is an enantiomeric mixture.", "Examination of Inhibitory Effects of Three Isolated Compounds on Mycelia Growth of Agricultural Pathogenic Fungi and Oomycetes in vitro", "A previous study revealed that NEP-1 had strong in vitro bioactivity against a series of fungal and bacterial species (Li et al., 1997a). Piperazine-2,5-diones including PDKP and MDKP are an important class of cyclodipeptide compounds of versatile bioactivities (Borthwick, 2012). However, scarce work described their antimicrobial activity against plant pathogens. Thus, to further explore their potential as bio-pesticides, we evaluated their inhibitory effects on mycelial growth of 10 common phytopathogens in vitro with results listed in Table 1. NEP-1 showed a broad antimicrobial spectrum and exhibited high inhibitory effects against R. solani, P. infestans, and F. graminearum, with inhibition rates of 82.74, 80.41, and 80.93%, respectively. R. solani was most sensitive to NEP-1. Moreover, the EC50 values of NEP-1 against R. solani and P. infestans were determined to be 40 and 51.25 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (Table 2). Noteworthily, NEP-1 also exhibited higher inhibition rates at 100 \u03bcg/ml than MBC at 0.5 \u03bcg/ml against the selected pathogens except F. graminearum, P. capsica, and S. sclerotiorum. Similarly, compared to the antimicrobial activity of MZ at 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, higher inhibition rates were observed for NEP-1 at 100 \u03bcg/ml against the tested pathogens except E. turcicum and G. gramini. PDKP displayed a moderate inhibitory effect against G. graminis (inhibition rate of 35%) and weak inhibitory effects against R. solani, P. infestans, S. sclerotiorum, and A. alternate (inhibition rate < 40%) at 100 \u03bcg/ml. MDKP, however, remarkably inhibited the mycelial growth of E. turcicum with an inhibition rate of 67.60% at 100 \u03bcg/ml, higher than that of NEP-1. These results indicate that NEP-1 is an excellent antifungal agent with a broad spectrum and that MDKP has the potential to control the maize leaf spot disease caused by E. turcicum.", "Inhibitory effects of the three isolated compounds on the mycelial growth of 10 plant pathogens.", "Pathogenic fungi Inhibition rate (%).", "NEP-1 PDKP MDKP MBC MZ.", "Rhizoctonia solani 82.74 \u00b1 0.29a 14.08 \u00b1 0.05 <5.00 70.70 \u00b1 0.15* 24.39 \u00b1 0.10*.", "Exserohilum turcicum 63.78 \u00b1 0.33e 5.86 \u00b1 0.09 67.60 \u00b1 0.11* <5.00 79.38 \u00b1 0.08*.", "Phytophthora infestans 80.41 \u00b1 0.16b 14.24 \u00b1 0.32 <5.00 8.84 \u00b1 0.47* 25.42 \u00b1 0.34*.", "Fusarium graminearum 80.93 \u00b1 0.08b 6.74 \u00b1 0.05 <5.00 92.78 \u00b1 0.08* 21.44 \u00b1 0.50*.", "Verticillium dahliae 75.73 \u00b1 0.05c <5.00 <5.00 18.96 \u00b1 0.12* 13.79 \u00b1 0.05*.", "Phytophthora capsici 68.42 \u00b1 0.13d <5.00 <5.00 81.59 \u00b1 0.10* < 5.00.", "Botrytis cinerea 65.06 \u00b1 0.10e <5.00 24.35 \u00b1 0.04 14.88 \u00b1 0.28* 25.88 \u00b1 0.05*.", "Sclerotinia sclerotiorum 61.95 \u00b1 0.09f 18.48 \u00b1 0.04 <5.00 99.17 \u00b1 0.06* <5.00.", "Alternaria alternate 59.23 \u00b1 0.08f 8.12 \u00b1 0.24 <5.00 <5.00 15.36 \u00b1 0.05*.", "Gaeumannomyces gramini 49.75 \u00b1 0.10g 35.00 \u00b1 0.05 <5.00 46.05 \u00b1 0.12* 73.73 \u00b1 0.10*.", "The concentration of NEP-1, PDKP, or MDKP was set as 100 \u03bcg/ml.

The morphological variations as well as the average lesion length of the inoculated plants in different treatment groups are illustrated in Figure 4. In the blank control groups, both of the rice and broad bean plants were severely infected by R. solani, with an apparent symptom of sheath blight disease (Figures 4C,D). However, the disease severity was effectively alleviated in the NEP-1 treatment groups (Figures 4C,D). Correspondingly, the lesion length on the inoculated plants in each NEP-1 treatment group was much smaller than that in the corresponding blank control group (Figures 4A,B). Moreover, no obvious difference was observed in the lesion length on the rice plants between the NEP-1 treatment group (1,000 \u03bcg/ml) and the MBC treatment group (500 \u03bcg/ml) (Figure 4B).

Thus, we tested the capacity of NEP-1 to suppress the sclerotial development of R. solani. As illustrated in Figure 5, on the plates with 40 \u03bcg/ml of NEP-1, few sclerotia were observed at the 6th day after inoculation and only a few abnormal sclerotium associated with large droplet secretion appeared after 12-day incubation. We further tested the effects of NEP-1 on the sclerotial development of R. solani at low concentrations (15, 20, and 30 \u03bcg/ml) with results shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Compared with the control plates, sclerotial formation was considerably suppressed with an increase of the NEP-1 concentration after 6 days of incubation. There were a very limited number of sclerotia occurring in the plates with 15.00 \u03bcg/ml of NEP-1 (Supplementary Figure S4B). Meanwhile, the sclerotial maturation was also prevented by NEP-1 and no mature sclerotia were observed when the concentration of NEP-1 was above 20.00 \u03bcg/ml (Supplementary Figure S4). Moreover, NEP-1 could also suppress the sclerotial germination significantly even at a very low concentration (15.00 \u03bcg/ml) (Figure 6).
