["Results", "Fbx15 is essential for a general stress response in Aspergillus fumigatus", "A. fumigatus fbx15 (Afu3g14150) corresponds to the gene of A. nidulans encoding F-box protein 15, which is required for development [4,20]. Several cDNAs of this gene locus were sequenced and revealed that the A. fumigatus fbx15 gene structure consists of two exons and one intron resulting in a deduced open reading frame of 655 codons for a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 75 kDa (Fig 1A). Alignments of the A. fumigatus Fbx15 primary sequence revealed that high similarities are restricted to the Aspergilli counterparts with similarities between 72.8% and 59.8%, whereas Fbx15-like proteins of other filamentous fungi like Penicillium chrysogenum or Neurospora crassa share significant lower similarities of 43.6% and 24.7% respectively (Fig 1B, S1 Table). Two signature motifs are located almost in the middle of Fbx15 and include motif 1, which is specific for the genus Aspergillus and motif 2 that is also present in other fungi as P. chrysogenum or N. crassa (Fig 1B, S2 Table). Bioinformatics analysis predicts two nuclear localization signals (NLS), which suggest that Fbx15 might exhibit its function in the nucleus (Fig 1B).", "10.1371/journal.ppat.1005899.g001Fig 1\nAspergillus fumigatus F-box domain protein Fbx15 is indispensible for oxidative stress response.(A) fbx15 genomic locus, structure and transcripts.

The mutant strain formed normal colonies on minimal medium (MM), but oxidative stress caused by 3 mM H2O2 abolished growth, whereas the wild type could still grow (Fig 1C). 1 mM H2O2, which had no impact on wild type, resulted in hyperbranched, swollen hyphae in the \u0394fbx15 strain (Fig 1D). On media containing superoxides-producing menadione or thiol-oxidizing diamide the \u0394fbx15 mutant displayed defects in growth and sporulation, which implies a general Fbx15 mediated resistance mechanism against oxidative stress, upstream of distinct stress response pathways (S1B Fig). Severe growth and sporulation defects were also observed when the \u0394fbx15 mutant was exposed to other stress conditions including elevated temperature, amino acid starvation, microtubule stress, osmotic stress or mutagenic stresses (S1C Fig).", "The importance of Fbx15 during stress was compared to other F-box proteins, which have been previously shown to be involved in fungal development. Fbx23 is important to initiate A. nidulans asexual development [4,21\u201323], whereas GrrA is an F-box protein that is required for the maturation of sexual spores [26\u201329]. These two F-box proteins are conserved from fungi to higher eukaryotes (S1 Table). Characterization of both deletion mutants in A. fumigatus showed more distinct and less prominent phenotypes compared to the \u0394fbx15 mutant strain. In contrast to the wild type, deletion of fbx23 led to a decreased colony size, whereas the colony size of the \u0394grrA mutant was not affected under normal growth conditions (Fig 1C).", "Growth defects of \u0394fbx23 and \u0394grrA in comparison to wild type were observed under amino acid starvation or microtubule stress. Both deletion strains were sensitive to topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT, whereas DNA-methylating MMS had a similar impact on wild type and mutant growth (S1C Fig). These results indicated that Fbx23 as well as GrrA are involved in the DNA replication process, whereas Fbx15 is additionally required for the repair of DNA-damage caused by methylation. Growth under increased temperature or oxidative stress conditions are important virulence factors of A. fumigatus [30]. The deletion of fbx23 led to a reduced colony size under high temperature (42\u00b0C) or oxidative stress, when compared to the wild type, whereas the \u0394grrA strain was only slightly affected by H2O2 (Fig 1C, S1C Fig).", "These data suggest that the three F-box proteins Fbx23, GrrA and Fbx15 are part of a general stress response in A. fumigatus caused by multiple environmental stressors. The impact of the strain lacking Fbx15 suggests that this protein plays a key role in the fungal stress response.", "Oxidative stress transiently induces fbx15 expression", "Oxidative stress caused drastic effects on the \u0394fbx15 mutant, whereas fbx15 overexpression resulted in a wild type like phenotype (S1A Fig). Oxidative stress, in particular by peroxides like H2O2, leads to an elevated expression of catalases, which function as potent ROS scavenger [31,32]. A. fumigatus produces one conidial and two mycelial catalases. The expression of cat1, which encodes one of the mycelial catalases, was regulated in an Fbx15 dependent manner. The lack of fbx15 led to an approximately 2.5x derepressed basal cat1 expression, compared to wild type or a complemented strain during non-stress conditions (Fig 1E). After exposure to H2O2, the expression of cat1 in the \u0394fbx15 mutant was further increased, whereas wild type or complemented strain displayed only slight upregulation. Increased cat1 levels were not sufficient to protect the \u0394fbx15 mutant from oxidative stress. Fbx15 presumably is involved in additional molecular mechanisms, which protect against oxidative stress. The exposure to oxidative stress was analyzed as a possible external signal, which triggers changes in fbx15 expression in A. fumigatus. Fungal cultures were exposed to H2O2 and harvested at different time points within a 120 min period. fbx15 transcript levels were determined with real-time PCR (RT-PCR). A rapid increase of fbx15 expression was observed in the first 20 min reaching its maximum peak at 40 min with a 14-fold increased gene expression. Afterwards the expression decreased to a basal level, which is approximately 4-fold increased compared to the non-induced expression. Proteins from the same samples were extracted to test whether the changes in fbx15 transcript levels are also reflected on protein level. Fbx15 was visualized after immunoblotting by incubation with a polyclonal Fbx15 specific antibody. The general abundance of Fbx15 was very low. A three-fold increase of Fbx15 protein amounts was measured, starting after 40 min of H2O2 exposure, which was similar in the complemented strain and absent in the \u0394fbx15 mutant, mirroring the increased gene expression on the protein level with a delay of 20 min (Fig 1F, S1D Fig). These data suggest that the Fbx15 protein levels are increased as part of a stress adaption response towards H2O2 mediated ROS.", "Fbx15 is predominantly localized in the nucleus", "Two putative nuclear localization sites of Fbx15 suggest a nuclear function. A similar situation is found for the conserved A. fumigatus F-box protein SconB, which also possesses two nuclear localization signals, and was used as control (S1 Table). Similar to sconB of A. nidulans, sconB is essential for A. fumigatus as we could show with heterokaryon rescue assay (S2A and S2B Fig). Constitutively expressed GFP fusions of Fbx15 and SconB were compared for their subcellular localizations. Both F-box GFP fusions were functional during normal and oxidative stress growth conditions (S2C Fig). Fbx15 and SconB are primarily co-localized in fluorescence microscopy with DAPI stained nuclei, though small subpopulations of both proteins remain in the cytoplasm (S2D Fig). These data suggest a predominant nuclear function for both A. fumigatus F-box proteins.", "Fbx15 is phosphorylated during vegetative growth under non-stress conditions", "Fbx15 is primarily nuclear but has a significant cytoplasmic subpopulation. Different localizations of Fbx15 could be a result of controlled posttranslational phosphorylation. A bioinformatic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of Fbx15 with NetPhos 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos) [33\u201335] predicts in total 15 serine, 11 threonine and 4 tyrosine residues as putative phosphorylation sites (score value between 0 and 1; cutoff value >0.5: S3A Fig). An Fbx15 phosphopeptide with a single phosphorylation was identified with mass-spectrometry of purified functional Fbx15-TAP fusions from non-stressed cultures. Analysis of the MS2-spectra of this phosphopeptide with the phosphoRS software [36] revealed serine residues 468 and 469 as potential phosphorylation sites with probabilities of 45.5% each, whereas Ser473 only showed a low probability of 8.9% (Fig 2A). Theoretical analysis for Fbx15 phosphosites showed a high score value of 0.988 for Ser469, whereas Ser468 had a low score value of 0.029 and therefore is unlikely to be phosphorylated (S3A Fig). In contrast no phosphopeptides were identified for purified Fbx15-GFP fusions when the cells were grown under oxidative stress. Fbx15 is presumably phosphorylated during vegetative growth under non-stress conditions at Ser468 or Ser469 (Ser468/469), whereas it is unphosphorylated when H2O2-mediated oxidative stress is applied.", "10.1371/journal.ppat.1005899.g002Fig 2Fbx15 phosphorylation decreases during oxidative stress treatment and shifts the cellular interaction site with SkpA to the nucleus.(A) Phosphorylated peptide of Fbx15 identified by LC-MS/MS after TAP-purification.

GFP-traps with Fbx15-GFP recruited GlcA as the only phosphatase that interacts in cultures with or without stress (S3B Fig). A direct interaction of Fbx15 with GlcA could be observed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), which was primarily visible after induction with H2O2 (S3C Fig). The A. nidulans GlcA homolog BimG has been characterized as essential major protein phosphatase 1, which is associated with thermo tolerance and hyphal morphology, features that were impaired in the \u0394fbx15 mutant [37,38]. Heterokaryon rescue experiments with a glcA deletion cassette and accompanying Southern-hybridizations verified that the situation is similar and glcA is essential for A. fumigatus as well (S3C and S3D Fig).", "The dephosphorylation rate of Fbx15 in response to H2O2 was quantified. Fbx15-GFP expressing strains were grown in liquid cultures and subjected to oxidative stress by adding 3 mM H2O2. Fbx15-GFP from these cultures was purified and treated with an antibody against phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues. The rate of dephosphorylation was quantified against the overall amount of Fbx15-GFP, determined by an anti-GFP antibody (Fig 2B). 40% dephosphorylation upon H2O2-treatment indicated that Fbx15 becomes dephosphorylated in an oxidative stress-dependent manner. The Fbx15 dephosphorylation sites were localized by TMT isobaric mass tag labeling and LC-MS/MS [39]. Fbx15-GFP was enrichment from cultures before and after H2O2 treatment and separated on a coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. After tryptic digestion, peptides from the untreated culture were labeled with TMT127 (heavy) whereas TMT126 (light) was used for all time points of the H2O2 treated cultures. The sample of time point zero was individually mixed with all other time points and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The parameters for fragmentation during mass spectrometry were set to identify only the phosphorylated peptide of Fbx15. Specific ratios of the heavy labeled phosphopeptide were obtained from time point zero against the light labeled phosphopeptides from the other conditions. These values were quantified against the ratios of two unmodified reference peptides of Fbx15, which represented the overall amount of purified Fbx15. The reciprocal values of these ratios are decreasing, thus reflecting a specific dephosphorylation on Ser468/469 (Fig 2C). Fbx15, which becomes phosphorylated at Ser468/469 under non-stress conditions, is presumably dephosphorylated when cells encounter H2O2-mediated oxidative stress by the Fbx15 interacting phosphatase GlcA/BimG.", "Fbx15 dephosphorylation shifts the interaction with SkpA from the cytoplasm into the nucleus", "The canonical function of F-box proteins is their ability to form ubiquitinating SCF ligase complexes by binding to the SkpA adaptor. A. fumigatus Fbx15 and SconB interactions to the SkpA SCF adaptor were compared by using BiFC. Both Fbx15 and SconB protein fusions produced an YFP-signal, indicating F-box protein-SkpA interactions. SconB interacted with SkpA almost exclusively in the nucleus (>90%), whereas 74% of the Fbx15-SkpA interaction was cytoplasmic (Fig 2D and S4A Fig). The Fbx15 serine codons of wild type positions S468 and S469 were replaced to alanine residues to mimic a constantly dephosphorylated Fbx15[S468|9A] to analyze whether Fbx15 phosphorylation is relevant for the location of the Fbx15-SkpA interaction. Interaction of Fbx15[S468|9A] variant with SkpA resulted in a nuclear signal (Fig 2D). Dephosphorylated Fbx15 primarily interacts with SkpA in the nucleus to form SCF-complexes.

The impact of the phosphorylation state of Fbx15 on its ability to interact with SCF-complexes was analyzed by replacing the serine residue S469 in Fbx15 with aspartate to mimic a constant phosphorylation Fbx15[S469D] or S468 and S469 with alanine to mimic unphosphorylated Fbx15[S468|9A].

Further analysis included MaxQuant quantitative proteomic software in conjunction with Perseus software for statistical analysis, with a focus on the subunits of the SCF-ligase machinery. SCFs are activated by the RING protein RbxA-mediated interaction with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and covalent cullin modification by ubiquitin like NeddH (Fig 3B). SCF core components SkpA or CulA interacted with Fbx15, independently of the phosphorylation-state. Native Fbx15, which is presumably dephosphorylated at S468/S469 after oxidative stress or unphosphorylated Fbx15[S468|9A] could co-purify NeddH, but not RbxA or an E2 enzyme. In contrast the Fbx15, mimicking a constant phosphorylation, co-purified all subunits for an active SCF complex. NeddH was more abundant in co-purifications of the constantly phosphorylated Fbx15[S469D] than of unphosphorylated versions of Fbx15. RbxA and the E2 enzyme UbcM were only purified with negatively charged Fbx15[S469D], indicating an improved assembly of functional SCF-ligase complexes when Fbx15 is phosphorylated at Ser469 (Fig 3C). Active SCFFbx15 complexes contain therefore more likely phosphorylated than unphosphorylated Fbx15.", "Since Fbx15 interacted within SCF complexes the cellular ubiquitination pattern of the \u0394fbx15 mutant, wild type and the fbx15 overexpression strain were compared before and after induction with H2O2. Neither the ubiquitination-pattern nor the general protein composition of the \u0394fbx15-strain was significantly altered in comparison to the wild type or the fbx15 overexpression strain, suggesting that the ubiquitination targets of SCFFbx15 complexes are limited (S4B and S4C Fig).", "Fbx15 recruits 38 putative interacting proteins during TAP-enrichment", "Additional potential interacting proteins for Fbx15 were identified by tandem-affinity-purification (TAP) and compared to co-purifications of SconB-TAP fusions. Variants of fbx15 and sconB were created where the conserved proline of the F-box domain was exchanged to a serine. This should weaken the F-box-SkpA binding and enable recruitment of SCF-independent interaction partners. The exchanged proline in SconB led to significantly increased protein stability, whereas stability of Fbx15 was not altered (S5 Fig). This reflects a possible autocatalytic mechanism for SCFSconB, where SconB is ubiquitinated within its own SCF ligase and eventually degraded [40,41], whereas Fbx15 stability seems to be independent of SCFFbx15. SconB-TAP recruited less proteins (22) than Fbx15 (38). SconB interactors include transcriptional activator MetR as known SCFSconB target [1] and 11 proteins that were identified for both F-box proteins including SCF subunits CulA and SkpA. Only Fbx15 was able to co-purify three subunits of the CSN deneddylase, which acts on neddylated cullin complexes, which do not interact with substrates [3]. This might reflect a highly dynamic assembly/disassembly of SCFFbx15 complexes (S3 Table).", "The predominant nuclear localization of Fbx15 and SconB is consistent with nuclear interaction partners, which were identified during TAP co-purifications. These included two transcriptional regulators (RcoA/Tup1 and a putative APSES transcription factor), a DNA repair enzyme (AFUA_2G06140) and a single-stranded DNA binding protein (AFUA_5G07890/Rim1p) (Fig 4A). The fact that Fbx15 and SconB recruited these proteins might reflect a tight stability control by more than one F-box protein. In addition Fbx15 recruited specifically three transcriptional regulators (OefC, SrbB and SsnF/Ssn6), a nuclear GTPase (AFUA_4G8930/Nog2p) and the nuclear pore protein Nic96. (Fig 4A). A potential candidate, responsible for Fbx15 phosphorylation is the interacting cyclin-dependent serine/threonine kinase NimX/Cdc28p, which is required for cell cycle control and conidiophore morphology in A. nidulans [6]. A direct interaction of Fbx15 and NimX could be verified by BiFC assay, where the interaction signal from the reconstituted YFP was observed predominantly in the cytoplasm (S6A Fig).

An interesting finding is that both F-box proteins co-purified RcoA/Tup1 as part of the conserved transcriptional co-repressor complex RcoA/Tup1-SsnF/Ssn6, but only Fbx15 recruited the SsnF/Ssn6 subunit of this complex.", "Fbx15 interaction with SsnF does not change the stability of the co-repressor subunit", "The yeast Ssn6-Tup1 co-repressor complex affects the expression of 7% of all genes with emphasis on stress responses [9]. A homo-tetramer of RcoA/Tup1 repressor subunits is connected to one SsnF/Ssn6 adaptor protein, which binds to a DNA-binding protein, escorting the repressor complex to the target genes. The corresponding SsnF encoding gene of the model A. nidulans is essential for growth, whereas the yeast counterpart Ssn6 is dispensable [9,42]. With heterokaryon rescue and subsequent Southern analysis we could show that ssnF is not only essential for A. nidulans but also for A. fumigatus (S6D and S6E Fig). A BiFC signal verified the direct interaction of Fbx15 and SsnF in A. fumigatus under non-stress conditions in the cytoplasm, often located close to nuclei. Unphosphorylated Fbx15[S468|9A] which reflected H2O2-mediated oxidative stress conditions interacted with SsnF predominantly in the nucleus, similar to the Fbx15-SkpA interaction (Fig 4B). Fbx15 levels in different strain backgrounds did not influence SsnF stability in cycloheximide (CHX) protein-stability assays (Fig 4C). The amount of SsnF-GFP in wild type or fbx15 deletion mutant did not change in the absence or presence of 3 mM H2O2 nor did SsnF exhibit an Fbx15 dependent ubiquitination pattern (S6F and S6G Fig).

In fbx15 wild type as well as in the fbx15 variant strain (Fbx15[S469D]), that mimics constant phosphorylation, SsnF-GFP was localized in the nucleus. In the fbx15 codon replacement mutant expressing the Fbx15[S468|9A] variant, which cannot be phosphorylated, SsnF accumulated at the nuclear envelope similar to the \u0394fbx15 strain.

We analyzed the expression of gliZ, which encodes a transcriptional activator that has been shown to drive the expression of gli-genes encoded in the gliotoxin gene cluster and gliP, encoding the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase GliP with a key role in gliotoxin biosynthesis [21,23]. The expression of gliZ and gliP in the \u0394fbx15 mutant increased by almost thirteen and five times respectively in comparison to wild type or complemented strain. Gliotoxin is a toxic metabolite for A. fumigatus itself. Expression patterns of gli genes, which are important for detoxification mechanisms, were examined. These include gliK, which is required for gliotoxin biosynthesis and secretion or gliT encoding a oxidoreductase with the ability to reversibly form the toxic disulphide bond of gliotoxin [27\u201329].

The transcription of gli genes is derepressed and in addition the gliotoxin production is increased in the absence of Fbx15, when SsnF accumulates at the nuclear periphery. The transcription of gli genes is also increased in the presence of an unphosphorylatable Fbx15, which excludes SsnF from the nucleus, but gliotoxin production is not increased.

The \u0394fbx15-infected mice did not show any symptoms and had the same clinical appearance as the mock infected control group, treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Histopathology analyses of infected lung tissue were consistent with survival rates. Mice infected with either wild type or complemented strains showed fungal hyphae surrounded by tissue necrosis and extensive immune cell infiltration (Fig 6F). Moderate immune cell infiltrates were found in the lungs of mice infected with the \u0394fbx15 mutant, but no fungal hyphae could be detected. The fungus was cleared at an early stage of infection, probably by innate immune responses and increased temperature and elevated oxidative stress. Our data suggests that Fbx15, which is not required for growth without stress, plays a crucial role during infection because it enables A. fumigatus to adapt to innate immune response conditions of the host including limiting nutrition, fever or oxidative stress."]
