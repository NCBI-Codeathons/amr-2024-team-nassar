["Results", "Characterization of the glidonin biosynthetic gene cluster", "Our previous study showed that the silent NRPS BGC11 from S. brevitalea DSM 7029 was activated successfully by in-situ constructive promoter PApra insertion using Red\u03b1\u03b27029 recombineering40 and produced a series of products, designated glidonins here, in the activated mutant S. brevitalea DSM 7029\u00a0PApra-BGC11, as shown by comparative metabolic profile analysis40 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). Bioinformatic analysis showed that the glidonin (gdn) BGC included two essential core NRPS genes (gdnA and gdnB) and several additional genes (Fig.\u00a01a and Supplementary Table\u00a01). To determine the additional genes involved in the biosynthesis of glidonins, we inactivated each gene through Red\u03b1\u03b27029 recombineering40. The LC\u2012MS profiles showed that deletion of the gene gdnC (AKJ30060.1), which encodes an ABC transporter ATP-binding permease44, abolished all products, indicating its critical role in the efficient transportation of glidonins, while the other mutants failed to impact the production of glidonin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Thus, the core genes of the gdn gene cluster are gdnA, gdnB, and gdnC, spanning approximately 44\u2009kb contiguous DNA region.Fig. 1The biosynthetic pathway of glidonins.a Genetic organization of the gdn gene cluster. b Organization of modular enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of glidonin. c Structures and formation of glidonins A-L (1\u201312).

Its three modules (modules 1\u20133) are predicted to activate Phe, Asn, and Pro by A domain specificity analysis45 (Supplementary Table\u00a09). The NRPS GdnB includes nine canonical modules (modules 4\u201312) activating Val, Phe, Pro, X (defined as an unknown amino acid by AntiSMASH), Val, Ala, Ala, Ser, and Ala, respectively45, as well as an incomplete termination module 13 containing a C domain, a partial A domain (A*), a T domain, and a noncanonical TE domain with two putative TE domains (TE1 and TE2) identified by the presence of two conserved active motifs (GXSXG)46 according to bioinformatics analysis47 (Supplementary Figs.\u00a019 and 20 and Supplementary Table\u00a09). The absence of the N-terminal subdomain (Acore) and the Stachelhaus codes in the A* domain leads to the A* domain retaining only a C-terminal subdomain (Asub), which means it fails to function in amino acid activation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a019b, c). The A* domain shows similarity (Coverage: 190/409; Identities: 41%-45%) to other A domains of GdnB, but it is not possible to predict the specificity of the A* domain due to the absence of the Stachelhaus codes (Supplementary Table\u00a015 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a019d). This kind of A* is rare in nature besides the non-functional A* domain of the kutzneride assembly line, which is critical for the stand-alone A domain KtzN-mediated transfer of Glu48. Further investigation is needed to determine the function of unusual termination module 13 of the gdn BGC, and structural elucidation of glidonins could provide valuable insights.", "Structural elucidation of glidonins", "Eight target products were purified from the fermentation of S. brevitalea DSM 7029\u00a0PApra-BGC11. Glidonin A (1, Fig.\u00a01c, Supplementary Note\u00a01) was obtained as a colorless oil with the molecular formula C65H98N16O14S (HR-ESI-MS, m/z 680.3699 [M\u2009+\u20092H]2+, calcd 1359.7242). Interpretation of its 1H, 13C, and DEPT NMR spectra (Supplementary Table\u00a02, in MeOD-d4) revealed that 1 was a dodecapeptide containing the following amino acid moieties: Met, Asn, two Pro, two Val, Phe, Trp, three Ala, Ser, and one Put. The sequence of the amino acids and the location of Put were established by detailed interpretation of the HMBC correlations from amide protons and adjacent carbonyl groups (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03, in DMSO-d6). The NMR data of glidonin B (2) and glidonin D (4), whose molecular formulas were shown to be C65H98N16O15S and C66H98N16O15S by HR-ESI-MS, were also quite similar to the NMR data of 1, except for the obvious chemical shift variation of the methionine sulfoxide [Met(O)] residue in 2 and an additional aldehyde group (\u03b4H/\u03b4C 8.15/164.0) in 4 (Supplementary Tables\u00a03 and 4). The Met(O) in 2 is isomer and, in fact, was observed as a mixture of two epimeric compounds (major: 2a, minor: 2b). The molecular formulas of glidonins F-J (6-10) were found by HR-ESI-MS to be C75H116N16O15S, C77H120N16O15S, C77H120N16O16S, C78H122N16O15, and C79H124N16O15S. A comparison of the NMR data of 6, 7, and 10 (Supplementary Tables\u00a04, 5, and 6) with 1 and analysis of their 2D NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03) revealed that a decanoyl in 6, a lauroyl in 7, and a myristoyl in 10 are connected to the amino group of the Met moiety. Similarly, an additional lauroyl in 8 is connected to the amino group of Met(O) compared with 2, which was supported by 2D NMR correlations (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). Compound 8 also existed as a mixture of isomers, and the NMR data for the major rotamer of 8 are summarized in Supplementary Table\u00a05. The 1D NMR data (Supplementary Table\u00a06) of 9 are also quite similar to those of 7 except for the replacement of Met in 7 by Leu in 9. The structural compositions of the above eight compounds were confirmed by HR-ESI-MS/MS fragmentation (Supplementary Figs.\u00a09, 10c, 10d, 11c, 11d, 12, and 13). Due to low yields, the structures of glidonin C (3), glidonin E (5), glidonin K (11), and glidonin L (12) were characterized by detailed comparative analysis of HR-ESI-MS/MS fragmentation (Supplementary Figs.\u00a010a, 10b, 11a, 11b, and 14).", "The absolute configuration of the amino acid monomers in these compounds was determined by Marfey\u2019s analysis49 combined with bioinformatic analysis of five dual C domains with epimerization and condensation activities50 in the Gdn NRPS assembly line (Fig.\u00a01b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a023, and Supplementary Table\u00a010). The results demonstrated that the amino acid constitutions of these compounds are D-Met1(or D-Met(O)1/D-Leu1)-D-Asn2-L-Pro3-L-Val4-D-Phe5-L-Pro6-L-Trp7-D-Val8-L-Ala9-D-Ala10-L-Ser11-L-Ala12 (Fig.\u00a01c).", "The formation of N-terminal diversity of glidonins", "The final products of the Cs domain-embedded gdn gene cluster should be lipopeptides, but the nonacylated products (1,\n2 and 3) were identified here. To test whether 1-3 were derived from the incomplete function of the Cs domain, we inactivated the Cs domain in-situ by two patterns, which failed to produce any glidonins, indicating that the Cs domain was required for the biosynthesis of all glidonins (Fig.\u00a02a). Therefore, we hypothesized that a deacylase is responsible for the deacylation of lipopeptide glidonins as a post-assembly modification. The genome of S. brevitalea DSM 7029 contains three PvdQ-like acylase enzymes (AKJ26698.1, AKJ30942.1, AKJ29580.1). The deletion of AKJ30942.1 (named GdnD), which showed 68% similarity to PvdQ and was far away from the gdn BGC (1,002,342\u2009bp), abolished the production of 1-5, as shown by HPLC\u2012MS analysis (Fig.\u00a02b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d). Subsequently, we used the cell lysate containing acylase GdnD (85\u2009kDa) to test its deacylation function because we failed to obtain the soluble protein (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a). The nonacylated products 1 and 2 were detected in the reaction mixture containing GdnD incubated with 7 and 8 for 4\u2009h, 16\u2009h, and 27\u2009h, respectively, but not in the boiled cell lysate (Fig.\u00a02c). Therefore, GdnD is responsible for the removal of the fatty acid chain as a post-assembly modification in the biosynthesis of 1 and 2. In addition, GdnD was also functional for other lipopeptides with mid- or long acyl chains and lipopeptides with the L-/D- configuration of the first amino acids and different lengths of peptide chains, exhibiting some substrate diversity (Fig.\u00a02e, f and Supplementary Note\u00a02). Notably, we detected formylated 1 (4), 13a (13b) and 14a (14b) in the reaction mixture of the GdnD assay (Fig.\u00a02d, g and Supplementary Fig.\u00a022), indicating that the formylation could be catalyzed by a formyltransferase from Escherichia coli, and 4 should be derived from tailoring formylation of 1. The in vivo gene deletion and in vitro assays allowed us to determine that 1 was formylated by methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase to form 4 (Supplementary Note\u00a03).Fig. 2Identification of Cs domain and acylase PvdQ enzymes.a LC\u2013MS analysis of crude extracts at EIC 650-800 of activated mutant DSM 7029\u00a0PApra-gdn and two inactivated mutants of Cs domain, DSM 7029\u00a0PApra-gdn:CsHH::AA and DSM 7029\u00a0PApra-gdn\u0394Cs. b HPLC\u2013MS profile of crude extracts of activation mutant DSM 7029\u00a0PGenta-gdn, and three deletion mutants of acylases PvdQ.

The formation of an unusual Met(O) of 2 might be a Met oxidized derivative during the isolation process from facile oxidation of the sulfide in Met of 1. However, 1 and 2 were detected in the fermentation broth, and purified 1 was dissolved in MeOH for 3 days without changing to 2, suggesting that the Met(O) residue was not generated by a tailoring reaction that took place after peptide formation. We assumed that the A1 domain might select the nonproteinogenic amino acid Met(O). To test this hypothesis, we constructed and obtained the soluble protein CsA1T1 from E. coli BAP151 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07a). The in vitro adenylation activity toward the A1 domain, as determined by an ATP/PPi exchange assay52, demonstrated that the A1 domain could indeed select L-Met(O), but the preferred substrate was L-Met (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a). The successful loading of substrates L-Met(O), L-Met, and L-Leu onto the T1 domain was confirmed by using A1T1 and CsA1T1 proteins (Supplementary Fig.\u00a024). We also tested the selectivity of Cs using lauroyl-CoA (C12-CoA) and myristoyl-CoA (C14-CoA) as donor substrates and L-Leu, L-Met, and L-Met(O) as acceptor substrates. Lauroyl products 18-20 and myristoyl products 21-23 were detected in vitro (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b, c), demonstrating that Cs could incorporate lauroyl and myristoyl moieties into the peptide assembly, consistent with the in vivo results. Therefore, the diverse substrates of initiation module 1 might be employed as an exchange element for the combinatorial biosynthesis of NRPS to generate structural diversity in pharmacologically relevant compounds.", "Assembly of the putrescine moiety", "Genetic and biochemical analyses of the assembly of the Put moiety at the C-terminus of nonribosomal peptides remain elusive. Comparing BGCs encoding nonribosomal peptides with a C-terminal Put moiety, we found that the C-terminal multi-domains of the last module in the different NRPS assembly lines were different, such as C-T di-domains, C-A-T-TE domains, and C domain (Fig.\u00a03a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). The function of termination module 13 (C13A*T13TE) of glidonin was investigated here to elucidate the mechanism of Put incorporation into the peptide chain. We first performed site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate the conserved active sites of the C13, T13, and TE domains in vivo (Fig.\u00a03b). The metabolic profiles showed that the inactivation of the C13 domain or T13 domain abolished glidonins, and the mutants \u0394TE2(S10624A) and \u0394TE1/2(S10391A/S10624A) reduced the yields of glidonins, but the mutant \u0394TE1(S10391A) had no obvious influence on the yields of glidonins compared with that of the wild type (Fig.\u00a03c, d). Therefore, the C13 domain and T13 domain on module 13 were essential for glidonin biosynthesis in vivo, and the TE domain seemingly was not involved in the release of final products from the NRPS assembly line due to the presence of the final products in the mutants of the TE domain.Fig. 3Identification of the domains in charge of Put introduction in vivo.a The nonribosomal peptides with a C-terminal Put and their termination modules of NRPSs. hfOrn: N5-formyl-N5-hydroxyornithine, haOrn: N5-acetyl-N5-hydroxyornithine, RXP: Rhabdopeptide/xenortide-like peptide. b Schematic diagram of the different mutations of module 13. c HPLC\u2013MS chromatogram obtained from the crude extract of the culture of the different mutants. 1 (m/z 1359.7 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+), 2 (m/z 1375.7 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+), 4 (m/z 1385.7 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+), 7 (m/z 771.4 [M\u2009+\u20092H]2+), 9 (m/z 762.4 [M\u2009+\u20092H]2+), 10 (m/z 785.4 [M\u2009+\u20092H]2+), 12 (m/z 776.4 [M\u2009+\u20092H]2+). d Yield comparison of the compounds from the culture of the different mutants and wild type.

All soluble proteins were obtained except A12T12C13 and A12T12C13A*T13TEMut1/2, hinting that A* and the two conserved Ser residues of TE may be involved in the correct folding of the protein A12T12C13A*T13TE. Moreover, the importance of the T13 domain in maintaining protein structural stability was demonstrated, as the purified A12T12C13A* protein was relatively unstable and prone to precipitation after thawing. An ATP/PPi exchange assay52 was conducted to evaluate the activity of the six mutants. A12T12C13A*T13 and A12T12C13A*T13TE maintained the same bioactivity toward substrate L-Ala as the control protein A12T12, but the others showed decreased activity of A12 (Fig.\u00a04a), which might be due to the instability or incorrect folding of A12T12C13A*, A12T12C13A*T13TEMut1(S10391A), and A12T12C13A*T13TEMut2(S10624A).

Source data and the exact p values are provided as a Source Data file.", "Afterward, we incubated substrates L-Ala and Put with the six proteins for the condensation assay (Fig.\u00a04b). The target product 24a was observed in all reactions, including the reaction of protein A12T12 with relatively low yield, which indicated that the free amino of Put could attack the carbonyl of T12-linked Ala to form Ala-Put (24). In group 1, the highest yield of 24a was obtained in the reaction containing protein A12T12C13A*T13. The yield in A12T12C13A* was higher than that in A12T12, although the reduced activity of A12 to L-Ala showed that the C13A*T13 domains and C13A* domains both greatly promoted the intermolecular condensation of T12-linked Ala with Put in vitro (Fig.\u00a04b). Notably, the protein A12T12C13A*T13TE showed a greatly decreased yield of 24a compared with A12T12, revealing that the TE domain preserved the hydrolysis function and resulted in a reduced yield of intermediate T12-linked Ala in vitro. In group 2, despite reduced activity toward the substrate L-Ala compared with A12T12C13A*T13TE and A12T12 in group 1, as mentioned above, the mutants A12T12C13A*T13TEMut1(S10391A) and A12T12C13A*T13TEMut2(S10624A) exhibited higher yields of the target compound (24a) than A12T12C13A*T13TE and A12T12 in the condensation test. These results further support the notion that the TE domain has hydrolysis activity, and this function is abolished when the typical Ser active site is mutated. In addition, the yield of 24a in the reaction containing A12T12C13A*T13TEMut2 was higher than that in the reaction containing A12T12C13A*T13TEMut1 under similar activity for substrate L-Ala (Fig.\u00a04a, b), which implied that mutation of the Ser site of the TE1 and TE2 domains both led to reduce the hydrolysis function of TE in vitro, and the effect of the Ser site mutation was more pronounced in the TE2 domain than in the TE1 domain, which was consistent with the results observed in vivo (Fig.\u00a03c, d). Based on the aforementioned results, we can infer that the C13 domain is directly involved in the intermolecular condensation of T12-linked Ala and free Put. Moreover, the A* and T13 domains are essential for protein folding and stability in vitro.", "Combining the in vivo and in vitro results, it can be concluded that the C13 domain selects Put as an intermolecular nucleophile for elongated peptide chain release, resulting in diamine incorporation at the C-terminus, and the A*T13 di-domain is essential for stabilizing the NRPS structure. As we presented, the TE domain (both for TE1 and TE2) retains its hydrolysis function in vitro (Fig.\u00a04b), which was further supported by the TE deletion test in vivo (Supplementary Fig.\u00a032). The final products can still be obtained for the deletion of TE2, and the product without Put can be produced for P13-TE (deletion of C13A*T13 and insertion of the P13 promoter for TE). Despite having a hydrolysis function, the TE domain does not directly participate in the release of final products. Instead, it can impact the folding or stability of the NRPS, as shown both in vivo and in vitro (Figs.\u00a03d and 4a). This is supported by the observation that deletion of the TE domain and TE2 significantly decreased the yield of the final products compared with the wild type (Supplementary Fig.\u00a032). Moreover, the TE domain may also assist in the efficient operation of the full-length NRPS pipeline in vivo by hydrolyzing any stagnant by-products resulting from the malfunction of the Put release step, as we previously discussed regarding glidomide41. This was also supported by the observation of an intermediate (9a) without the Put moiety found in the crude extract of both wild-type and mutant strain with a constitutive promoter P1353 inserted in front of the TE domain (Supplementary Fig.\u00a032).", "The C13 domain could condense free putrescine with T12-linked Ala, suggesting that the acceptor binding pocket of the C13 domain might be appropriate for Put. The docking between Put and the pocket of the C13 domain protein predicted by AlphaFold254 showed that three residues (S9963, D9965, E9984) of the C13 domain, which were not conserved in other C domains, might be relevant to the substrate Put (Fig.\u00a04c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a017). Then, we constructed nine mutants of the A12T12C13A*T13 protein to investigate the impact of these residues on the function (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07d, e, f). The in vitro assays showed that the yield of 24a from three mutants (S9963A, D9965A and E9984A) was greatly decreased, almost to that of mutant A12T12C13A*T13 (H9721A) and A12T12, at the premise of their similar activity toward the substrate L-Ala (Fig.\u00a04d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a016a, c). Moreover, the three mutants altered the substrate specificity of the C13 domain for the substrates putrescine and 1,5-diaminopentane, resulting in a reduced catalytic activity toward putrescine and increased catalytic activity toward 1,5-diaminopentane (Supplementary Fig.\u00a016b), indicating that these three crucial residues are located within the binding pocket. The recovery of catalytic activity in the mutants with the original amino acid properties (S9963A vs. S9963Q, D9965A vs. D9965E and E9984A vs. E9984D) suggested the importance of the properties of these three residues (Fig.\u00a04d). This indicated that these three residues might be key sites for substrate binding, especially E9984, which is located on the \u03b2-sheet of the C13 domain. The impact of the length of the amino acid side chain on the product yield (S9963A vs. S9963V, D9965A vs. D9965L and E9984A vs. E9984M) suggested that it also created steric hindrance in the substrate binding pocket (Fig.\u00a04d). In summary, the three residues were essential for interacting with substrate Put, and our mutation results indicated that engineering the substrate specificity of this releasing module is a viable strategy.", "Introduction of putrescine into NRPs by multi-domain swapping", "Putrescine is also a precursor of some specialized compounds, such as industrial polyamide nylon 4,633 and siderophore alcaligin55. To clarify the function of the Put moiety of glidonins, we synthesized lipopeptide 10a without the Put group. Compound 10 was easily soluble in water, methanol and acetonitrile, while compound 10a was soluble only in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which indicated that the Put moiety could enhance the solubility of this lipopeptide. Moreover, the antitumor activities of 10a against the tumor cell lines A549 and HepG2 were lower than those of 10, demonstrating that the Put group might improve the bioactivities of lipopeptides (Supplementary Table\u00a011). These results indicated that introducing the Put moiety into lipopeptides might have the potential to improve the chemical properties and bioactivities of lipopeptides.", "To confirm this speculation, we tried to introduce the Put moiety into the assembly backbone of other lipopeptides by engineering the C-terminal module of NRPs. Two distinct types of lipopeptides, cyclic C8-rhizomide A56 (C8-Rzm A, 28) and linear holrhizin A42,57 (30), from Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica HKI 454, were used as the target products. To obtain the desired products, the different fusion regions using interdomain linkers from gdn BGC to rzmA-R148A (rzmA*) and holA BGCs were assessed. Considering that rzmA* encodes the cyclic lipopeptide, the strategy of substitution was used for engineering rzmA* (Fig.\u00a05a, b), and we detected the expected mass of product 29 (m/z 904.5882 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+) in both mutants. Additionally, the yield of 29 in C13A*T13TE substitution of RzmA*-M2 was higher than that in recombinant RzmA*-M1 (Fig.\u00a05c). We then purified and elucidated target derivative 29, whose molecular formula was C45H78N9O10, by HR-ESI-MS (Supplementary Fig.\u00a015a). NMR data and analysis of its 2D NMR spectra confirmed that 29 indeed included a Put moiety connected to the carboxyl group of Val (Supplementary Table\u00a07).Fig. 5Introduction of putrescine moiety on the two NRPs by multi-domain swapping.a The flow chart of engineering rzmA* BGC and corresponding products. b A diagram of the different multi-domain substitutions of the C-terminus of RzmA-R148A (RzmA*). c Yield comparison of C8-Rzm A (28) and its derivative 29 between wild type (WT) and mutants.

Metabolite profiles showed that the expected product 31 (m/z 774.5122 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+) was detected in different recombinants, and the optimal yield of 31 was from T12C13A*T13TE substitution of HolA-M1, which was better than the yield from C13A*T13TE substitution of HolA-M2 (Fig.\u00a05f). Moreover, the yield of 31 from the T12C13A* substitution of HolA-M3 was higher than that from the C13A* substitution of HolA-M4 (Fig.\u00a05f), which indicated that the preservation of the T12 domain in multi-domain substitution contributed to the increased production of derivative 31. Subsequently, the structure of derivative 31 was elucidated by HR-ESI-MS and NMR, which showed a Put moiety connected to the carboxyl group of Ala (Supplementary Table\u00a08 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a015b). To verify the effect of a Put moiety on the bioactivities of these compounds, two Put-lacking lipopeptides 29a and 31a were synthesized. Bioactivity assays showed that 29 and 31 indeed exhibited higher anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities than 29a and 31a (Supplementary Table\u00a012 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a029).", "To further explore the minimal exchange units in charge of Put moiety assembly, six different exchange units were used to engineer the holA BGC (Fig.\u00a05e). We found that four engineered strains produced another derivative (32) of holrhizin A, but HolA-M5 with C13 domain substitution and HolA-M10 with A*T13TE domain substitution did not (Fig.\u00a05g), demonstrating that the minimal domain C13A* was required for Put assembly in vivo, which was consistent with the aforementioned in vitro biochemical assays indicating that the C13 domain was in charge of Put incorporation and that A* might be very important for the structure of NRPS. The substitution sites of rzmA* and holA, along with their corresponding amino acid sequences and protein structure characteristics, are summarized in Supplementary Fig.\u00a025. During the substitution domain process, we also detected some short intermediates (28a,\n30a,\n30b) that were hydrolyzed in advance from the assembly line in different recombinants, as shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a030. In summary, the efficient substitution domains for the Put moiety engineered into NRPs by comprehensive analysis are the C13A*T13TE multi-domains, defined as the \u201cPut unit\u201d, which has application prospects for improving the activity and enhancing the water solubility of target compounds in the bioengineering field.", "Introduction of other diamines into NRPs", "We subsequently investigated the substrate tolerance of C13 using other potential diamines and polyamides, including 1,7-diaminoheptane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 1,5-diaminopentane, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, spermine, and spermidine, in addition to the native substrate Put in vitro. Only four corresponding compounds (24a,\n25a,\n26a and 27a) were observed in the reaction mixtures of Put, 1,5-diaminopentane, 1,6-diaminohexane, and 1,7-diaminoheptane by LC\u2012MS analysis. Moreover, the yield of 25a was higher than that of 26a and 27a but lower than that of 24a (Supplementary Fig.\u00a031a), revealing that the available substrates of the C13 domain were linear diamines, analogs of Put, and the longer lengths of diamines had a negative effect on the final product yield.", "In addition, to extend the application of the \u201cPut unit\u201d in bioengineering, three usable diamines (1,7-diaminoheptane, 1,6-diaminohexane, and 1,5-diaminopentane) were added into the culture of the engineered strain E. coli GB05-MtaA:RzmA*-M2. We found three corresponding desired derivatives 33 (m/z 918.6032 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+, calc. 918.6023), 34 (m/z 932.6167 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+, calc. 932.6179), and 35 (m/z 473.8216 [M\u2009+\u20092H]2+, calc. 946.6336) in the crude extracts in addition to the original compound 29, as confirmed by HR-ESI-MS/MS fragmentation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a031b, c, d). Bioengineering the \u201cPut unit\u201d can serve as a decent approach to enhance the diversity of NRPs with potential biological activities by feeding various diamines, and it can complement the Put binding pocket mutation method mentioned above.", "The bioactivity and function of glidonins", "The bioactivity of glidonins was screened by several assays (Supplementary Note\u00a04). The cytotoxicity assay showed that lauroyl products 7 and 9 and myristoyl product 10 exhibited not only broad-spectrum cytotoxicity but also strong activities against several tumor lines (Supplementary Table\u00a011). However, nonacylated compounds 2 and 3 showed no activities, and 1 had moderate activities against the Kasumi and A549 cell lines.", "To clarify the function of the deacylation step in glidonin biosynthesis for the host S. brevitalea DSM 7029, we compared the growth profiles and biofilm formation between the wild type (WT) and two mutants, DSM 7029\u00a0PGenta-gdn and DSM 7029\u00a0PGenta-gdn\u0394gdnD. The growth profiles of the two mutants exhibited unusual growth curves because the mutants produced unknown pigments (black line and red line, respectively) (Fig.\u00a06a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a018a, b). Once pigment absorption was deducted (black and red dotted lines, respectively), the WT showed better cell growth than the two mutants, while the growth of the activation mutant DSM 7029\u00a0PGenta-gdn was superior to that of the \u0394gdnD mutant (Fig.\u00a06a), which indicated that glidonins could inhibit the growth of DSM 7029 and that acylated glidonins might play a decisive role in this process. To directly evaluate the effect of acylated and nonacylated glidonins on wild-type DSM 7029, nonacylated compounds 1 and 2 and acylated compounds 7 and 10 were incubated with DSM 7029. The results revealed that the acylated compounds could obviously inhibit the growth of DSM 7029, but the nonacylated compounds had no effect (Fig.\u00a06c). These results demonstrated that the deacylation of gdn BGC could be a detoxification mechanism for the native host DSM 7029.Fig. 6The growth and biofilm formation between the wild type (WT) and mutants.a The growth profiles of DSM 7029 WT and two mutants were measured by culturing in CYMG medium.

Source data and the exact p values are provided as a Source Data file.", "The biofilm formation assays showed that DSM 7029\u00a0PGenta-gdn and \u0394gdnD increased biofilm formation compared to the WT, and the biofilm-forming capability of the activated mutant DSM 7029\u00a0PGenta-gdn was higher than that of the \u0394gdnD mutant (Fig.\u00a06b). The colonies of the two mutants appeared smaller than those of the WT in the swarming motility assay (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018d), which was consistent with the biofilm assays because swarming motility is often oppositely regulated and antagonistic to biofilm formation58,59. In addition, the colony morphology of the \u0394gdnD mutant was dry and wrinkled compared to that of the WT and the activated mutant, and the cell morphology of the two mutants was sticky relative to that of the wild-type strain, as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), due to the enhanced biofilm formation of the two mutants (Fig.\u00a06e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a018c). Additionally, acylated compounds 7 and 10 indeed increased biofilm formation of DSM 7029 wild type, but nonacylated compounds 1 and 2 had less effect on biofilm formation (Fig.\u00a06d). Thus, acylated glidonins could improve biofilm formation by inhibiting the swarming motility of DSM 7029, leading to alterations in the colony morphology of DSM 7029. Based on the above results, acylated glidonins could affect the growth state of DSM 7029, including growth speed, biofilm formation, and pigment secretions, but nonacylated products could not."]
