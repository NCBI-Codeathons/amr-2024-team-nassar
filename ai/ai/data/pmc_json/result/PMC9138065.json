["3. Results", "3.1. Transcriptome-Based Identification of Candidate Exporter Genes", "We initially assumed that the higher the salinomycin titer, the higher the transcription of the involved exporter genes. In order to establish a titer gradient, different concentrations of soybean oil (5%, 10%, and 15%) were supplemented to the fermentation broth, and the corresponding salinomycin titers were 5.30 g/L, 12.50 g/L, and 17.40 g/L, respectively. Using these three samples, transcriptomic data were collected using RNA-seq technology. According to the hypothetic concurrent relationship between salinomycin titers and the transcription of exporter genes, eight exporter genes with increasing expression patterns and that topped the fold-change of transcription at a higher salinomycin titer were selected from 248 ABC transporter genes and 23 MFS genes in the BK3-25 genome. These eight genes include seven ABC transporter genes, SLNHY_3363, SLNHY_4037, SLNHY_6316, SLNHY_6652, SLNHY_0818, SLNHY_0199, and SLNHY_1893, and one MFS gene, SLNHY_0929 (Figure 2 and Table S3). Although the transcriptions of SLNHY_3363 and SLNHY_0199 at 15% oil supplementation were lower than those at 10%, both of their transcriptions dramatically rose when the oil contents were shifted from 5% to 10%.", "In order to verify the transcriptomic data, the transcription levels of the eight candidate genes were measured using RT-qPCR with cultures collected on the third day of fermentation supplemented with 5% or 15% soybean oil, and all genes showed higher expressions with 15% oil supplementation, which was consistent with the transcriptomic data. Among them, SLNHY_929 demonstrated the highest expression, followed by SLNHY_3363 and SLNHY_1893 (Table S4).", "3.2. All Eight Candidate Genes Were Positively Involved in Salinomycin Export", "To investigate whether these eight genes are involved in salinomycin production, they were knocked out through homologous recombination. As shown in Figure 3A,B, the total salinomycin titers of all mutants decreased to 11.62\u201327.36% of that of BK3-25, and the intracellular concentrations of salinomycin increased to 143.61\u2013237.89% of that of BK3-25, indicating that these genes were positively related to salinomycin biosynthesis. Moreover, the deletion of \u0394SLNHY_0199 was the most pronounced, with a dramatic decrease in the salinomycin titer from 13.34 g/L to 1.55 g/L.", "Further verification of the above conclusion was conducted through trans-complementation of each mutant with the corresponding gene cloned under the control of PermE*. All individually complemented strains returned to 78.77\u201388.77% of the original titer of salinomycin (Figure 3C), and the intracellular accumulations of salinomycin synchronically returned to 62.36\u2013105.19% of the level of BK3-25 (Figure 3D), providing more proof of the involvement of these eight genes in salinomycin biosynthesis and, most likely, in its export.", "In addition, these eight genes were individually over-expressed in BK3-25 to see whether they played vital roles in salinomycin titer improvement. As expected, compared with the control strain bearing the empty vector pIB139, the excessive expression of these genes all increased salinomycin titers by 7.20\u201369.75%, especially BK3-25::SLNHY_3363 and BK3-25::SLNHY_0929, which had improved titers of 24.60 g/L and 22.85 g/L, respectively (Figure 3E). Accordingly, the intracellular salinomycin accumulations of all mutants showed a marked fall to 24.35\u201346.23% of the same level of BK3-25 (Figure 3F).", "3.3. These Eight Exporter Genes Were Constitutively Expressed", "In order to determine whether the expressions of these eight genes were constitutive or induced by salinomycin, the transcription profiles of each gene were obtained using RT-qPCR with samples collected each day during the whole fermentation period (Figure 4). Compared with the house-keeping gene hrdB, these exporter genes were actively transcribed at the very beginning and then gradually decreased along with the fermentation process. Since salinomycin obviously accumulated after the first day, as shown in Figure S7, we can safely draw the conclusion that these genes were constitutively expressed rather than being induced by salinomycin.", "3.4. SLNHY_0929 and SLNHY_1893 Improved Resistance to Salinomycin in Streptomyces lividans", "Even though these eight exporter genes were proved to be involved in salinomycin export, we still needed to determine why they functioned in this way. Streptomyces lividans TK24 was found to be susceptible to high concentrations of salinomycin, and the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) was 0.5 mmol/L for the control strain TK24::pIB139. These eight genes were individually introduced into S. lividans TK24. Although most mutants carrying the introduced exporter genes maintained similar susceptibility to salinomycin, TK24::SLNHY_0929 and TK24::SLNHY_1893 rendered the host with an improved resistance as high as 1.0 mmol/L (Figure 5A,B). These data strongly suggest the salinomycin export ability of SLNHY_0929 and SLNHY_1893, which exported the assimilated exogenous salinomycin out of S. lividans TK24.", "3.5. SLNHY_0929 Was a Universal Exporter for Polyether Antibiotics with Similar Structure with Salinomycin", "Since most polyether antibiotics shared similar hydrophobic structures, we wondered whether the exporter genes were universal in pumping them out and whether the genes played roles in improving their titers. Therefore, the three exporter genes with the most substantial effects on salinomycin titers when over-expressed in BK3-25, i.e., SLNHY_0929, SLNHY_3363 and, SLNHY_4037, were heterologously expressed in Streptomyces lasaliensis ATCC 31180 (a lasalocid producer), Streptomyces cinnamonensis ATCC 15413 (a monensin producer), and Streptomyces hygroscopicus XM201-ga32 (a nigericin producer). Herein, the previously used PermE* promoter was replaced by a stronger promoter kasOp*, since the latter was reported to work better in XM201 [22,27].", "Interestingly, the heterologous expression of SLNHY_0929 resulted in a significant improvement in all three antibiotics, with lasalocid titers from 163.60 mg/L to 262.50 mg/L in S. lasaliensis (Figure 6A), monensin titers from 572.40 mg/L to 1,286.00 mg/L in S. cinnamonensis (Figure 6B), and nigericin titers from 116.77 mg/L to 207.27 mg/L in S. hygroscopicus (Figure 6C). Surprisingly, the heterologous expressions of SLNHY_3363 and SLNHY_4037 had no positive effects on the production of these three polyether antibiotics, even with unexpected, dropped titers, and the reason needed further exploration. Overall, these results clearly show that SLNHY_0929 is a universal exporter for salinomycin, lasalocid, monensin, and nigericin, which shared similar molecular structures.", "Transporter engineering has been considered as a promising strategy to maximize secondary metabolite production in bacterial hosts, such as Streptomyces spp. and Aspergillus spp. [28,29]. Except for the exporters located in BGCs, BGC-independent exporters caused by horizontal gene transfer may also contribute to metabolite export [30,31]. To discover transporter genes located far from BGCs, expression profiling, genome-wide knockout studies, stress-based selection, and the inhibitor strategy have often been used [32].", "Herein, due to Streptomyces albus\u2019 highly efficient utilization of soybean oil, we found that salinomycin production rose as oil addition rose, and the transcription levels of the genes involved in salinomycin PKS, \u03b2-oxidation, and precursor biosynthesis also increased [7]. Since transporters are the essential channels of both precursor import and salinomycin export, they are more necessary with the rise in ionophore product synthesis, so we decided to focus on the study of transporters. Next, we managed to mine eight transporter genes outside salinomycin BGC based on comparative transcriptome data under different salinomycin titers. Furthermore, all eight selected genes proved to be correlated with salinomycin synthesis by gene deletion and over-expression. Among the eight genes, only SLNHY_0929 and SLNHY_1893 encoded proteins that could pump salinomycin out of the cell and, thus, provide self-resistance to the host, according to the heterologous expression in the model strain S. lividans and the salinomycin supplement experiments. Our work constructed a novel method for antibiotic transporter gene mining. The fermentation characteristics of Streptomyces albus with a soybean oil preference were focused and combined with transcriptome sequencing technology, which showed a very successful titer improvement of salinomycin through exporter engineering and might apply to other antibiotics with oil-derived precursors. Therefore, this study also provides an application with great potential in promoting the more cost-effective production of salinomycin and other chemicals.", "MFS-type transporters are channels of multiple substrates, such as monose, polysaccharides, amino acids, polypeptides, vitamins, cofactors, secondary metabolites, chromophores, and bases. They can either function independently or cooperate with ABC transporters in metabolite efflux [17]. In our work, the MFS family gene, SLNHY_0929, was heterologously expressed in the producers of other polyether antibiotics, and it showed a broad spectrum of substrate identification, whose protein pumped out intracellular salinomycin, lasalocid, monensin, and nigericin, as well as increasing the titers of each. As a matter of fact, S. cinnamonensis ATCC 15413 possesses a homolog of the exporter gene SLNHY_0929, namely, orf6552, with 93% coverage and 75.81% identity, while none of the homolog is present in S. lasaliensis ATCC 31180 or S. hygroscopicus XM201-ga32. Thus, ORF6552 is considered to be an endogenous MFS transporter, which exports monensin from the host. Whether or not it served as another universal ionophore pump remains to be explored. Compared to specific exporters slnTI and slnTII in the gene cluster, SLNHY_0929 contributed more to salinomycin biosynthesis [12]. Meanwhile, endogenous exporters in lasalocid, monensin, and nigericin BGCs, which provide self-resistance to producing strains, have been reported. Lsd5 in S. lasaliensis showed 53% identity with MonT in S. cinnamonensis, and in S. hygroscopicus, R14/R15 formed an ABC transporter with 71% and 49% identities with the TMD and NBD of the transporter in S. avermitilis\u2019s BGC, respectively [33,34,35,36]. Until now, there have been no data about these self-exporters\u2019 functions on antibiotic production, so we could not compare them with the non-specific exporter SLNHY_0929. However, introducing this MFS transporter improved the polyether antibiotics\u2019 titers by over 60% and almost doubled monensin\u2019s titer, which demonstrates the efficacy of our method for transporter mining. Due to the constitutive expression of these exporter genes, we can safely draw the conclusion that SLNHY_0929 served as a universal and stable pump by flexibly identifying polyether compounds. Whether or not it could recognize other types of chemicals remains unknown. SLNHY_1893, SLNHY_3363, SLNHY_4037, SLNHY_0199, SLNHY_0818, SLNHY_6316, and SLNHY_6652 all belong to ABC transporters; however, they cannot export salinomycin according to the MIC results implemented in Streptomyces lividans. Their functions were speculated to be importers of soybean oil or other small nutrient molecules, or exporters of other secondary metabolites, such as actinopyranone and elaiophylin, whose BGCs were detected in the S. albus genome. Hence, on the one hand, in a future study, intracellular acyl-CoA concentrations will be detected to study whether these proteins pump fatty acids and glycerol derived from soybean oil [37]. On the other hand, we would like to strengthen or weaken the expression of these pumps and observe the production of possible metabolites to identify the pumps\u2019 function.", "Additionally, since each transporter exported salinomycin and improved its biosynthesis, it would be interesting to examine whether these pumps are competitive or cooperative. Thus, tandem over-expression of two or more genes will be employed to study their relationship, which may push the salinomycin titer to a higher level. By means of electronic microscope observation and molecular dynamics simulation, the conformation change of transporters during the pumping of salinomycin will be analyzed. Besides export, other resistance strategies, including the inactivation of antibiotics and the modification of function targets, are worthy of study with regard to salinomycin. Further bioinformatic and functional analyses are likely to provide answers to these questions."]
