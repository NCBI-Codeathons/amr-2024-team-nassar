Its 16S rRNA gene sequence was deposited in NCBI (accession no. NCBI:txid2136401). According to its morphological and physiological properties and the 16S rRNA BLAST results, the YIM 121038 isolate was identified as a strain of Streptomyces sp.

In silico analysis of the draft genome for the presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) using antiSMASH 6.0 (14) revealed >50 putative clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesis (see Table\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material). The chromosome of YIM 121038 harbored 42 BGCs, several of which could be associated with a high degree of certainty with known secondary metabolites. Most of the BGCs detected on the YIM 121038 chromosome (29 out of 42) had very close homologues in the genome of Streptomyces sp. strain MNP-20 and Streptomyces sp. strain NRRL B-1347.

This compound was subjected to structure elucidation by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The 1H NMR and heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra suggested that there were 7 doublet methyls, two singlet methyls, 8 protons attached to sp2 carbons, and many oxygenated methines (Fig.\u00a0S1B to E). Correlation spectroscopy (COSY) correlations showed 10 units, a to j (Fig.\u00a01; Fig.\u00a0S2F and G). heteronuclear multiple-bond correlations (HMBCs) unambiguously revealed the mode of connections of those units (Fig.\u00a01A; Fig.\u00a0S1H and I). The sugar moiety was attached to C-22, which was determined by HMBCs from H-22 to C-1\u2032. The presence of 46-NH was deduced by COSY correlations between H-46 and 46-NH measured in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 (Fig.\u00a0S1G). Finally, the succinyl moiety was identified by HMBCs from H-2\u2033/3\u2033 to C-1\u2033/C-4\u2033 and shown to be attached to the N terminus of unit j by an HMBC from H-46 to C-1\u2033.

This observation suggested that the succinyl group attached to the primary amine is detrimental for the antibacterial activity of desertomycin. In order to properly assess antibiotic activity of desertomycin A, it was tested, along with some clinically relevant antibiotics, on a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the broth microdilution method. This test did not reveal any measurable activity of desertomycin A against Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli, at concentrations below 128\u2009\u03bcg/mL. This can be explained by different physiological conditions of bacterial cultures on the solid agar medium (initial disk assay) and in liquid cultures (CLSI method). At the same time, desertomycin A exhibited moderate activity against all of the Gram-positive bacteria tested, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus mutans (Table\u00a0S2).", "Antibacterial activity of desertomycin A and desertomycin X against Gram-positive bacteria.

Since no genes coding for N-acyltransferases that could catalyze the aforementioned reaction were identified within the desertomycin cluster (BGC28) (Table\u00a0S1), the YIM 121038 genome was manually mined for genes encoding GNAT-like proteins.

These results strongly suggest that sterically unhindered aliphatic amine groups are preferred sites of modification by CsbC, while aromatic amine groups are not or only very weak acceptors (Table\u00a02). This activity is not restricted to antibiotics, as was confirmed by the formation of N- and N,N\u2032-succinylated derivatives of the antibiotically inactive primary metabolites putrescine and ornithine (Fig.\u00a0S3J and K).", "According to the MS/MS spectra, the preferred succinylation site in vancomycin is the secondary amine on the glycopeptide\u2019s N terminus (data not shown), presumably because the primary amine is localized on a sterically hindered tertiary carbon. In the case of tetracycline, where we would expect no amide formation to occur, the small amount of detected succinylation is apparently due to the formation of an ester with an nonphenolic OH group, as demonstrated by an [M-C4H6O4+H]+ fragment ion in the MS/MS spectrum (data not shown). Presumably, this reaction is also catalyzed by CsbC, since no such product is observed in the reaction mixtures quenched with formic acid (FA) before incubation.", "According to the LC-MS analyses, acetyl-CoA can be used by CsbC as acyl-group donor instead of succinyl-CoA for some of the tested antibiotics, but generally with a much lower efficiency. Acetylated products were detected for kanamycin (Fig.\u00a0S3I), desertomycin A (Fig.\u00a0S3A), and, to a very low extent, for vancomycin, but not for ampicillin and daptomycin (data not shown).", "To test whether the formation of desertomycin X by CsbC is related to self-resistance, its production in relation to desertomycin A was followed over 6\u2009days of cultivation, whereby the culture medium and the cell pellet were separated before extraction. Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038 was found to be a very prolific producer of desertomycin A, with high levels being detected already after 1\u2009day of cultivation in both the pellet and the supernatant (Fig.\u00a0S4A to F). Relevant amounts of desertomycin X were only detected at day 2, but at low levels compared to desertomycin A. Furthermore, N-acetyl desertomycin A was produced at even higher levels than desertomycin X. The concentrations of all three congeners did not increase much or even decrease again after 2\u2009days of fermentation under the given conditions. Interestingly, the relative abundance of desertomycin X compared to desertomycin A and N-acetyl desertomycin A was much higher in the supernatant. None of these findings are in line with N-succinylation or N-acetylation of desertomycin A being relevant for self-resistance, but fit the low affinity of CsbC for desertomycin A found in vivo. The LC-MS data from the whole extracts also revealed the isomerization of all three congeners over time, particularly in the supernatant.", "(A) Monitoring the production of desertomycin congeners in Streptomyces sp. strain YIM 121038 over 6 days of cultivation in TSB medium.

Considering this, we tested the kanamycin resistance of an S. lividans TK24/pUWL-csbC strain, which expresses the native csbC gene. Growth of S. lividans TK24/pUWL-csbC in liquid medium and on the agar plates with up to 7\u2009\u03bcg/mL of kanamycin (concentration causing complete growth inhibition) was monitored. No differences in growth could be detected compared to the control strain S. lividans TK24/pUWLoriT (empty vector) and the strain expressing csbC.", "Next, kanamycin resistance of E. coli BL21/pA_CsbC, which harbors a vector with an ampicillin resistance gene and provides for IPTG (isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside)-inducible CsbC expression, was tested. It was expected that after addition of IPTG, the production of recombinant CsbC will be induced and the intracellular kanamycin will be inactivated via N-succinylation. After 24 h of cultivation in the kanamycin-supplemented medium with and without IPTG induction, the BL21/pA_CsbC strain grew considerably better than the control strain BL21/pA (Fig.\u00a07A). At the same time, it was obvious that induction with IPTG significantly suppresses the bacterial growth of both the CsbC-expressing strain and the control strain. Western blot analysis of samples demonstrated a weak expression of CsbC in BL21/pA_CsbC cultures, even without IPTG addition, indicating T7 promoter leakage (Fig.\u00a07B). Apparently, this weak expression was nevertheless sufficient to enhance resistance of strain BL21/pA_CsbC to kanamycin.", "FIG\u00a07Development of kanamycin resistance in E. coli BL21 after expression of CsbC in vivo.

Here, we could show that with all tested ampicillin concentrations, the strain carrying the CsbC-expressing vector grew better than the control E. coli BL21 strain with the pET30a(+) vector (Fig.\u00a08). The difference in growth between the two strains could be best seen in medium containing the smallest amounts of Amp (5 and 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL). Due to the fact that CsbC showed a broad substrate specificity, we decided to study its kinetics in reaction with ampicillin as the substrate. The initial idea of using kanamycin as a substrate was rejected due to the presence of several amino groups that were apparently modified by this enzyme. Ampicillin, on the contrary, harbors only one amino group, which makes the analysis more precise than that with kanamycin. Vmax and Km constants were determined based on the formation of N-succinylated ampicillin (Amp-S), the concentration of which was calculated from the data from HPLC analysis (Fig.\u00a0S5). The Microsoft Excel Solver was applied in this calculation to increase the accuracy of data interpretation, which resulted in calculated values for of 0.47\u2009mM for Km and 0.61\u2009mM/min for Vmax.", "FIG\u00a08Development of ampicillin resistance in E. coli BL21 after expression of CsbC in vivo with the pET30a(+) expression system.
