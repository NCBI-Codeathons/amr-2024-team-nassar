["RESULTS", "Association between SCCmec, STs, and agr genotypes to lugdunin activity", "In total, 202 S. lugdunensis isolates were screened for SCCmec, STs, agr genotypes, and lugdunin activity. In all, 48 strains were found to be ORSL, whereas 154 were classified as oxacillin-sensitive S. lugdunensis (OSSL). A representative result of lugdunin activity is shown in Fig. 1. SL118 without the lug operon was used as a lugdunin-negative control strain. Higher lugdunin production by S. lugdunensis has been observed under iron-limited culture conditions (9); however, we observed that without treatment with a ferrous iron chelator (2-DP), none of the test strains showed lugdunin activity. However, after 2-DP treatment, SL85 exhibited the highest anti-S. aureus activity (zone size >0.2 cm), followed by SL158 (0.15\u20130.2 cm), SL163 (0.1\u20130.15 cm), and SL243 (\u22640.1 cm) (Fig. 1).", "Fig 1Representative results of lugdunin activity using agar spot test.

Of the 154 OSSL strains, 35 (22.7 %) were classified as lugdunin producers (Table 1). Among the 16 lugdunin-producing ORSL S. lugdunensis strains, SCCmec type V, VT, and untypable strains were found in 14, 1, and 1 strains, respectively (Table 1). More than 50% (14/27) of the SCCmec type V ORSL S. lugdunensis strains were lugdunin producers. Nevertheless, no statistical difference in oxacillin susceptibility (P = 0.398) and the type of SCCmec (P = 0.147) was observed between the lugdunin-producing and non-producing strains. Of the 110 agr II S. lugdunensis strains, 34 (31%) were lugdunin producing; however, only 16 (18%) lugdunin-producing S. lugdunensis strains were found in the 89 agr I type isolates (P = 0.014). ST3 (32 strains) was dominant in the 51 lugdunin-producing S. lugdunensis strains, followed by ST1 (10 strains), ST6 (5 strains), ST2 (2 strains), ST24 (1 strain), and ST27 (1 strain) (P < 0.001) (Table 1). The majority of the ORSL showed a clear zone measurement of 0.15\u20130.2 cm (10 strains), followed by >0.2 cm (4 strains) and 0.1\u20130.15 cm (2 strains) (Table 1). In addition, a clear zone measurement of 0.15\u20130.2 cm was also observed in the majority of the OSSL strains (18 strains), followed by >0.2 cm (11 strains) and 0.1\u20130.15 cm (5 strains), whereas only one strain was observed to have a clear zone measurement of \u22640.1 cm (Table 2).", "Distribution of lugdunin activity in S. lugdunensis with different oxacillin susceptibility, SCCmec, agr, and MLST types", "Oxacillin susceptibility and genotype Total strain number Inhibition zone size (cm) of lugdunin-producing strains, no.

Although no statistical difference was observed between the lugdunin production and genotypes of ORSL strains (P = 0.350), our data showed that 27 (56.3%) ORSL strains were ST3-SCCmec V-agr II genotypes, 14 (51.9%) of which were lugdunin producing and 13 (48.1%) were lugdunin-non-producing (Table 2). We observed that 16 ORSL strains were positive for the ST6-SCCmec II-agr I genotype, and interestingly, none of the 16 (100%) strains were lugdunin producers (Table 2). Only two ORSL strains belonged to ST3-SCCmec VT-agr II, and one (50%) was a lugdunin producer (Table 2). Finally, only one (100%) ORSL was classified as ST3-SCCmec IV-agr II-positive and was noted to be a lugdunin-non-producing strain (Table 2). The difference in the distribution of STs and agr genotypes was statistically significant between the lugdunin-producing and non-producing OSSL strains (P < 0.001). In all, 52 OSSL strains belonged to ST6-agr I, and 47 (90.4%) of them were classified as non-lugdunin-producing strains (Table 2). In addition, 28 OSSL strains belonged to ST3-agr II, and 15 (53.6%) of them were lugdunin-producing strains (Table 2). Moreover, 24 OSSL strains belonged to ST27-agr II, and only one of them produced lugdunin (Table 2). We also observed that the 31 OSSL strains included 14 ST4-agr II, 4 ST9-agr II, 4 ST12-agr I, 3 ST15-agr I, and 6 ST29-agr II strains, all of which did not produce lugdunin (Table 2). In all, 12 OSSL strains were also classified as ST1-agr I, and 10 (83.3%) were lugdunin-producing strains (Table 2).

ST45 hVISA cells were not collected for the lugdunin activity assay. In addition, only one VISA ST239 strain was identified for this test, and the results showed that lugdunin had weak inhibitory activity against VISA. ST5 (two isolates) and ST239 (two isolates) hVISA isolates showed an inhibition zone ranging from 0.1 to 0.15 cm (Table 3). In contrast, lugdunin showed weak inhibition activity (\u22640.1 cm) against one ST59 and nine ST239 hVISA isolates.
