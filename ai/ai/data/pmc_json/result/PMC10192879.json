["3. Results and discussion", "3.1. Chemical analysis and metabolites annotation", "To study the effect of nutrient sources on the production of specialized metabolites by Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b, the strain was grown on four nutrient-rich media with different carbon sources to stimulate antimicrobial production. OSMAC approaches have allowed the discovery of new microbial compounds through easily adaptable changes, such as altering the carbon and nitrogen source, the concentration of nutrients, pH, or temperature (Li et al., 2013; Sha and Meng, 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). It is supposed to mimic natural environmental changes and can promote the expression of silent biosynthetic gene clusters inducing the microorganism to synthesize secondary metabolites with diverse scaffolds (Schwarz et al., 2021). Furthermore, alterations in the C/N ratio considerably affect the pH of the culture media through the formation of acids and organic bases (Pan et al., 2019). In Figure 1, the production of specific metabolites in each culture media can be observed, with the IMA medium having the highest amount of exclusively detected features and IMA and M2 having the most dissimilarity compared to the others. In this case, when the culture medium has a mixture of rapidly-assimilation and slowly-assimilation carbon sources, the former is preferentially used to produce cells and compounds of primary metabolism. After this faster assimilation, the second carbon source can be used to create specialized metabolites (Ruiz et al., 2010).", "Figure 1Bray-Curtis-based PCoA highlighting the chemical dissimilarity between extracts of Pseudomonas sp. cultivated on different culture media (A). Venn diagram with the total number of features detected on the extracts (B).", "Bray-Curtis-based PCoA highlighting the chemical dissimilarity between extracts of Pseudomonas sp. cultivated on different culture media (A). Venn diagram with the total number of features detected on the extracts (B).", "It is known that the presence of two or more carbon sources in the growing environment has a relevant impact on growth. Regulation of the sequential use of carbon sources in microorganisms is governed by carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and has a significant effect on many other cellular functions. The assembly of regulatory networks coordinates the differential expression of genes under limiting and non-limiting carbon source conditions. These mechanisms promote the use of nutrients that support high growth rates and consequently restrict the expression of non-essential genes for growth, avoiding high metabolic costs. Although knowledge about CCR is ancient, the mechanism for the formation of secondary metabolites in the Pseudomonas genus is not yet well established (Shahid et al., 2018; Ruiz-Villaf\u00e1n et al., 2022).", "Using culture media with different nutrient sources provided the synthesis of exclusive compounds in each culture condition in our study. Mapping culture media information on molecular networks made it easier to visualize these changes (Supplementary Figure S1). These approaches combined have already led to the discovery of several new microbial compounds (Cr\u00fcsemann et al., 2017; Zang et al., 2020; Han et al., 2022). The molecular network itself presents a strategy used mainly in the natural products field, as comparing and linking spectra with similar fragmentation patterns make it easier to recognize the chemical space that comprehends a set of samples, to determine the presence of analogs or new derivatives of known compounds and to perform annotation propagation within molecular families (Atanasov et al., 2021). The Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking platform also provides users with a spectral library of thousands of compounds, and experimental spectra can be automatically searched along the analyses (Wang et al., 2016; Aron et al., 2020). However, despite the increasing number of free-to-access spectral information available, annotating mass spectrometry data is still challenging. An excellent strategy to improve annotation rates is to use in silico tools and take advantage of structural libraries, which are much larger than spectral libraries. Here, we applied the NAP tool to promote in silico annotations of our spectral data based on a structural library composed only of compounds produced by Pseudomonas strains retrieved from the Natural Products Atlas platform. The putative annotation for (Z)-4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(1-hexenyl)-2-butenolide is observed only in the CGA medium, besides several related compounds were also detected in all the other media (Figure 2). In addition, rhamnolipids were also found in all culture conditions, but specific features were exclusive to M2 and CGA media. The bananamides\u2019 cluster features were mainly detected in the IMA media, with bananamide F also found in YES media (Figure 2).", "Figure 2Molecular families generated by GNPS molecular networking with level 3 annotations (MSI) obtained in the NAP analysis.", "Molecular families generated by GNPS molecular networking with level 3 annotations (MSI) obtained in the NAP analysis.", "In this work, the putatively annotated bananamides were bananamide D (detected m/z: 1065.670, [M\u2009+\u2009H]+, molecular formula: C53H92N8O14) and F (detected m/z 1039.650, [M\u2009+\u2009H]+, molecular formula C51H90N8O14). The \u0394m/z: 26.02\u2009Da between those annotations is consistent with the observed C2H2 difference on the compounds. Bananamides are cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) commonly found in the Pseudomonas genus and produced by NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters (Nguyen et al., 2016). CLPs are biosurfactants, and their mode of action generally consists of the penetration of the plasma membrane, creating pores that dysregulate ion fluxes and finally lead to the death of the cell (Bender et al., 1999). The first bananamide-like structure was isolated and elucidated from Pseudomonas granadensis (Geudens and Martins, 2018). Subsequently, another bananamide-type compound was isolated and characterized by Nguyen et al. (2016) from a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens isolated from the banana rhizoplane. These compounds have great potential for biotechnological use as an antibiotic, antifungals, and other antimicrobial activities (Cameotra and Makkar, 2004; Geudens and Martins, 2018). Within their functionality, antifungal properties have been presented by bananamides D-F against phytopathogens Pythium myriotylum and Pyricularia oryzae (Omoboye et al., 2019).", "We also were able to annotate the (Z)-4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(1-hexenyl)-2-butenolide compound (detected m/z 197.116, [M\u2009+\u2009H]+, molecular formula C11H16O3), which belongs to the butyrolactone class. This compound was isolated and characterized from Pseudomonas aureofaciens strain 63-28 and had antimicrobial activity against Pythium ultimum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Phytophthora cryptogea (Pascale et al., 1997). Butyrolactones are not exclusively detected on Pseudomonas, being also produced by actinobacteria (Franco et al., 1991) and, mainly, by fungi strains (Chen et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020; Tilvi et al., 2022), with several bioactivities reported. Due to their antimicrobial potential, synthetically obtained butyrolactones have also been designed and have demonstrated promising results to be applied as antiviral and antifungal agents in agriculture (He et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022).", "Finally, rhamnolipids are widely known biosurfactants, belonging to the class of glycolipid biosurfactants, mainly produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the first one being reported since the 60s (Edwards and Hayashi, 1965). As it has been studied for decades, this molecule has several attributed activities, including anticancer (Rahimi et al., 2019), antifungal (Vatsa et al., 2010; Carri\u00f3n et al., 2015; Sha and Meng, 2016) and antibiofilm activity (Silva et al., 2017). Due to their high biodegradability and non-toxicity, rhamnolipids have gained attention in different sectors, especially health and the environment (Thakur et al., 2021). Regarding the in silico annotation we got rhamnolipid 2 (detected m/z 527.320, [M\u2009+\u2009Na]+, molecular formula C26H48O9), which has shown potential application in soil remediation (Kristoffersen et al., 2018). The other annotated rhamnolipid (detected m/z 553.335, [M\u2009+\u2009Na]+, molecular formula C28H50O9), also isolated from an Antarctic Pseudomonas strain, has a bactericidal effect against a set of pathogens (Tedesco et al., 2016). In a previous study, OSMAC approaches have led to the discovery of novel rhamnolipids from another Antarctic Pseudomonas strain (Kristoffersen et al., 2018).", "It is worth noticing that all the annotated compounds in this work are part of molecular families with multiple non-annotated adduct ions that represent compounds structurally similar to the rhamnolipids, bananamides or the (Z)-4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(1-hexenyl)-2-butenolide. On molecular network analysis, within a molecular family with annotations, those unknown features can represent different adducts from the same known compounds (in positive mode for example, a \u0394m/z of approximately 23\u2009Da between two nodes can be indicative of a [M\u2009+\u2009Na]+ adduct, while a \u0394m/z of approximately 39\u2009Da can be indicative of a [M\u2009+\u2009K]+ adduct) or adducts from known compounds for which there are any available data on the databases used in the research, but might also characterize potentially new analogs for the annotated compounds (easy to detected examples are analogs with a methylation difference, \u0394m/z of approximately 14\u2009Da, and an oxygen loss, \u0394m/z of approximately 16\u2009Da) (Aron et al., 2020). We should also mention that besides the importance and usefulness of the annotation tools to enhance our comprehension upon the complex mixtures that characterize natural extracts, further isolation and structural elucidation are required for identification of metabolites, and bioassays based on pure compounds should be performed to confirm their bioactivities. In silico tools, like the one we used in this work, are usually more assertive on predicting molecular classes than the compounds for a given feature (da Silva et al., 2018), and so additional care must be taken by researchers using them. In this work, our approach used a database composed only of Pseudomonas-derived compounds in order to diminish false annotation rates, and we also inspected the predicted peaks to the substructures they were assigned for on the annotations. Even so, exploratory studies like this undoubtedly can take advantage of using such tools to highlight the chemical potential of promising strains (Cr\u00fcsemann et al., 2017; Bauermeister et al., 2018).", "3.2. Bioactivities of extracts against Rhizoctonia solani strains", "The crude extracts obtained from Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b culture in four different media was evaluated against five R. solani strains from diverse plant sources (Supplementary Figure S2). Most extracts inhibited at least one of the tested strains, except for the R. solani strain CMAA1592 which was not inhibited by any extract (Table 1). By comparing the bioassay results, the M2 culture medium presented the broadest potential for producing inhibitory compounds, reducing the growth of strains CMAA1417, CMAA1589, and CMAA1588 by 35,17, 60.45%, and 90,57%, respectively. The extract from IMA medium was also bioactive against more than one R. solani strain (CMES1861 - 67.67%, CMAA1588 - 43.74%). As shown in Figure 1A, those were the extracts with higher dissimilarity compared to the others evaluated in this work in the Bray-Curtis-based PCoA. Notably, the IMA medium produces a greater diversity of compounds, demonstrated through the greater amount of unique ions detected (Figure 1B), and was responsible for the production of the most bananamide-like molecular networks (Figure 2), where most ions were only produced when So3.2b was cultivated in this medium. The promising inhibitory effect of this crude extract remains expected, considering the well-demonstrated antifungal activity of bananamides and bananamides-like molecules from other Pseudomonas sp. strains isolated from plant rhizospheres (Omoboye et al., 2019).", "Inhibition percentage of R. solani strains by extracts of Pseudomonas sp.

Since those molecules are known to have bioactivity against other microbes, they are likely partially responsible for the antifungal activity observed in this work and the improved activity compared to other culture mediums, as previously studies have stated (Sha and Meng, 2016; Jishma et al., 2021). Additionally, the presence of rhamnolipids producer strains of Pseudomonas sp. in the rhizosphere of agriculturally relevant plants and their antifungal properties incur in the idea of a protective role against phytopathogens (Jishma et al., 2021). This result confirms the antifungal potential of Antarctic Pseudomonas strain So3.2b and its chemical production potential under OSMAC approach. Notably, the observed activity was obtained from the crude extract. Then, a stronger antifungal activity might be obtained from purified fractions of one or more compounds isolated from this strains for agricultural management.", "As Pseudomonas strains are ubiquitous to various environments, they are commonly isolated (Mielko et al., 2019), and have been notably used as biocontrol agents in agriculture (Dimki\u0107 et al., 2022; Guzm\u00e1n-Guzm\u00e1n and Santoyo, 2022), which suggests their chemical capacity. There are reports on literature on the potential of their metabolites, both volatile and non-volatile, against phytopathogenic microorganisms including R. solani (Sasirekha and Srividya, 2016; Wang et al., 2021). Phenazines (Shanmugaiah et al., 2010), furanones (Paulitz et al., 2000), pyrroles (Howell, 1979; Cartwright et al., 1995), and cyclic lipopeptides (Hua and H\u00f6fte, 2015; Oni et al., 2020) are among the main compounds responsible for the activity related specifically against this fungal pathogen. Regarding to the cyclic lipopeptides, it is interesting to bring up the results reported by Nielsen et al. (2000), who detected and isolated a tensin compound from extracts of a P. fluorescens strain and tried to apply an OSMAC approach to study tensin production and search for other bioactive compounds produced on different culture media. Their study demonstrated tensin quantitative variation related to changes on nutrients sources but did not detect the production of other bioactive compounds in response to those changes. In our study, we report a differential production of the annotated bananamides according to the culture media used. Siderophores produced by Pseudomonas may also be related to antifungal activity against R. solani (Sasirekha and Srividya, 2016). Although we did not annotate any siderophore from our extracts through spectral and in silico libraries searches, nonetheless a BGC encoding pyoverdine-like compound was detected on genome annotation (Table 2).", "Biosynthetic gene cluster of Pseudomonas sp.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies reported antifungal activity from Antarctic-derived Pseudomonas against R. solani specifically, but we do have reports on antifungal potential of some strains against other phytopathogenic fungi (Poblete-Morales et al., 2020). Psychrophilic and psychrotolerant bioactive microorganisms are expected to represent good opportunities for the development of new biopesticides and biofertilizers for agriculture in regions of cold climate conditions (Yarz\u00e1bal et al., 2018; Torracchi et al., 2020). But beyond that, their metabolome cannot be unconsidered, as it is widely accepted that they represent promising strains for natural products discovery (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Montero and Barrientos, 2018), as also revealed by genome analysis data (including this work) (Lee et al., 2017; Poblete-Morales et al., 2020). As demonstrated by our bioassay results, metabolites produced by Pseudomonas from Antarctica can lead to phytopathogen control even for fungal strains isolated from tropical climates. Also, by using the OSMAC approach we could better understand this strain\u2019s bioactivity profile. Considering both bioassay results and metabolomics analysis under the extracts, we hypothesize that more than one compound or compound class can be related to the antifungal activity reported, depending on the culture medium evaluated. Although crude extracts can be used on exploratory research such as this, leading to the assessment of chemical and bioactivity profiles of talented microorganisms (Cumsille et al., 2017; Bauermeister et al., 2018; Sabido et al., 2021), further approaches such as fractionation of extracts and the use of metabolomics tools such as Bioactivity-based molecular networks can lead to the detection of the compounds responsible for the activity and its isolation (Nothias et al., 2018).", "3.3. Characterization of identified biosynthetic gene clusters", "Pseudomonas sp. strain So3.2b has twelve different BGCs in its genome principally associated with ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPP), NRPS, and N-acetylglutaminylglutamine amide dipeptide (NAGGN), as well as other chemicals compounds like arylpolyene, betalactone, butyrolactone, hserlactone and a redox cofactor (Supplementary Table S1). Little to no similarity is noted between the identified molecules and previously reported clusters. The highest similarity percentage is the arylpolyene (35%) to a known APE Vf. These results suggest the idea of new molecules in this bacterial strain that could be related to the antifungal activity earlier discussed. Certain RiPP, arylpolyene, NRPS, and acyl amino acids have reported inhibitory effects against fungi (Table 2), therefore, may be related to the bioactivity of the strain.", "To relate the genetic biosynthetic content with predicted molecules from chemical analysis, we conducted a comparison between each of the BGCs of the Antarctic strain against the gene cluster encoding the indicated molecules. No related genes were found with the production of rhamnolipids or (Z)-4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(1-hexenyl)-2-butenolide. Nonetheless, the latter is likely to be produced by an unknown butyrolactone gene cluster found on the genome (BGC region 9, Supplementary Table S1). Meanwhile, bananamides D-G of the Pseudomonas sp. COW3 strain (Omoboye et al., 2019) showed the most significant similarity with the NRPS type gene cluster of region 7, which comprises five biosynthetic genes, seven regulatory genes, and 11 transport-related genes. Moreover, similar adenylation, condensation, and thiolation domains, transcriptional regulator genes, outer membrane lipoprotein genes, and efflux proteins of the bananamides-producer cluster are also present in So3.2b strain, indicating that this could be the biosynthetic cluster responsible for producing bananamide-like compounds (Supplementary Table S2; Omoboye et al., 2019). Bananamides compounds were characterized in Pseudomonas fluorescens strain BW11P2 (later reclassified as P. bananamidigenes) isolated from banana (Musa sp.) rhizosphere in Sri Lanka and named bananamides A-C (Nguyen et al., 2016). As our Antarctic strain is close to being considered a P. fluorescens strain, regarding average nucleotide identity comparison value above the same species indicator (>95%) (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Montero et al., 2023). It is reported that BGCs encoding cyclic lipopeptides in Pseudomonas have a significant degree of synteny, and the natural products synthesized from them often possess a high structural similarity (Christiansen et al., 2020). Therefore, the similarity between the chemically annotated and genomic compared molecules was confirmed through alignment of local collinear blocks between both COW3, and So3.2b strains clusters (Figure 3).", "Figure 3Syntenic comparison by alignment and identification of local collinearity blocks (LCBs) between the biosynthetic gene clusters from bananamide DF of Pseudomonas sp.

Hence, our results suggest that bananamide-like compounds are probably encoded by the NRPS cluster of region 7 of the Antarctic So3.2b strain. The bananamide-like compounds detected in this study are likely associated with its bioactive antifungal potential since the NRPS genetic cluster responsible for its production also contains multiple antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., macrolide resistance macAB), an observation in antibiotic producer microorganisms as a mechanism to avoid suicide by their own produced molecules (Almabruk et al., 2018). Even though our results suggest region 7 might be responsible for the bananamide-like compound detected in Pseudomonas So3.2b, this BGC also contains multiple other biosynthetic genes (Supplementary Table S2; Figure 3) that might produce several different combinations molecularly and structurally similar to bananamides, such as those analogs adduct ions detected on Figure 2 (Chevrette et al., 2020).", "Nonetheless, Antarctic Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b additionally has six BGCs associated with molecules of previously reported antimicrobial properties with low or no similarity to known molecules (highest similarity 35% of region 3 to an APE Vf, arylpolyene). Then, genomic and metabolomic pieces of evidence suggest that the Antarctic Pseudomonas So3.2b is a good source microorganism for the biodiscovery of novel antifungal products in the light of the non-traditional environmental isolation bioprospecting (Sekurova et al., 2019; Matos De Opitz and Sass, 2020). A similar approach to the one we used in this work was applied by Wang et al. (2020) to detect antifungal compounds produced by P. aeruginosa, where they compared metabolomics and genomics data of a bioactive (isolated from housefly gut) and an inactive strain (isolated from a wastewater treatment plant). Other similar approaches have been proposed to other Antarctic microorganisms of the proteobacteria phylum for natural product discovery (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Montero et al., 2020, 2022), and for several other bacteria from diverse environments (Maansson et al., 2016; Paulus et al., 2017; Tareen et al., 2022). Metabologenomics have been applied to fungi at a lower scale as the presence of introns in their genome makes gene prediction even more complex, but successful examples are available in literature (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2022; Hebra et al., 2022), and some tools are being developed to facilitate metabologenomics analysis of data from fungi strains (Caesar et al., 2023). It demonstrates the understanding consensus of the scientific community that linking metabolome and genome information can indeed accelerate natural products discovery. This approach has also been eased by the lowering costs of genome sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis on recent years (Van Der Hooft et al., 2020) and by the development of several tools that aim to automate the integration of both data types (Soldatou et al., 2019), besides manual correlation is still largely used (Van Der Hooft et al., 2020).", "3.4. Phylogenetic analysis", "A phylogenic analysis based on the core proteome was carried out using the complete genomes of the Pseudomonas genus. The resulting tree showed the greatest vicinity with P. shahriarae (putative P. fluorescens), P. yamanorum and P. veronii, all isolated from agricultural soil samples (Supplementary Figure S3). Our Antarctic strain is distant from the bananamides-producer P. botevensis COW3, therefore in their evolutionary history, othertraits, related to environmental adaptation might conferred a considerable phylogenetic distance in spite of sharing similar bananamides D and F biosynthetic clusters. Hence, it is likely that this similar biosynthetic pathways were independently acquired/evolved for each species. Also, this similar BGCs might be more related to an acquired characteristic to cope with specific environment than a vertical genetic evolution [such as for some core secondary metabolism (Chevrette et al., 2020)]. The Antarctic environment where strain So3.2b was isolated is considered poly-extreme due to the cold weather, dry conditions, and high contamination regarding agrochemical pollutants, heavy metals, and antibiotics possibly transported by anthropogenic activities, water, air or volcanoes eruptions (Zreda-Gostynska et al., 1997; Bhardwaj et al., 2018; Chu et al., 2019; Vergara et al., 2019; Hwengwere et al., 2022). Also, studies have shown that non-indigenous bacteria introduced in the Antarctic continent led to an increase in genetic diversity, including antibiotic resistance genes, intensifying the evolutionary and selective pressure toward survival adaptations (Cowan et al., 2011; Hwengwere et al., 2022). These conditions restrict the survival and growth of microorganisms and confers the selective environmental pressure that affects gene flow mechanisms related to evolution, such as horizontal gene transfer events (HGT), leading to similar biosynthetic gene clusters independently evolved, including NRPS clusters (Chevrette et al., 2020).", "The secondary metabolism developing through the recycling and repurposing of previous existing biosynthetic machinery\u2013 mediated by evolutive events such as horizontal gene transfer, or duplication is solid in antimicrobial compounds where an intense selective pressure is present (Chevrette et al., 2020). These ideas correlate with our results, where bananamide-like compounds were detected but showed substantial genetic differences on the known clusters responsible for their production, including multiple additional regulations, transport, and biosynthetic genes in the Antarctic Pseudomonas So3.2b (Figure 3). Additionally, genetic clusters tend to recruit genetic elements from phylogenetically distant clusters due to their wide range of substrates, positively affecting the selective pressure (Medema et al., 2014). Therefore, we propose our Antarctic strain could have evolved the bananamides-producer cluster independently through evolution events pressured by the poly-extreme environmental conditions of Antarctica. This explains the considerable phylogenetic distance between the bananamide producer COW3 and our So3.2b strains, regardless of the presence and synthesis of similar bananamides compounds with considerable BGCs differences."]
