["Results", "Development of a high-throughput collateral sensitivity screen in Escherichia coli", "To identify CS interactions, a panel of 29 drug-resistant strains covering multiple drug classes was derived from the standard lab model E. coli MG1655 (K-12). Twenty-six of these strains carry chromosomal resistance mutations and were isolated as spontaneous mutants on various antibiotic-containing agar plates, while an additional three strains were transformed using multidrug-resistant (MDR) plasmids from previously characterized clinical isolates18,19. Each mutant was sequenced to determine the genetic basis of its resistance, relevance to the clinical literature, and to ensure that it harbored only a single mutant gene, where applicable (Supplementary Table\u00a01). This approach allows unbiased comparisons between WT and drug-resistant strains due to a uniform genetic background and thus provides a fundamental perspective of CS in any chemical library. In brief, the target panel is comprised of the following: 7 quinolone-resistant strains with mutations in either DNA gyrase subunit A (gyrA) or subunit B (gyrB); 4 chromosomal multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains with mutations in one of two multidrug efflux pump pathways (marR or acrR); 3 rifamycin-resistant strains with mutations in bacterial RNA polymerase subunit \u03b2 (rpoB); 4 cephalosporin-resistant strains with mutations in either cell envelope biosynthesis (envZ) or lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (rfaH, rfaG); and 8 aminoglycoside-resistant strains with mutations in the cytochrome o oxidation pathway (cyoA), ubiquinone biosynthesis genes (ubiB, ubiF), or the 30S ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL). The 3 plasmid-borne MDR strains contain vectors from drug-resistant E. coli (pAC29, pAC30) or K. aerogenes (RK2). Together, the target panel covers a broad range of resistance mechanisms, including DNA replication, RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, cell wall biosynthesis, MDR, and plasmid-borne resistance. Approximately 60% of these strains contain mutations that have been previously reported in drug-resistant pathogens, with varying levels of clinical relevance20\u201326.", "We emphasized single, chromosomal mutants in this target panel as opposed to more clinically relevant mobile resistance cassettes for three main reasons. Firstly, the focus of this study was to explore the prevalence of CS in nature using a first-principles approach; target panel selection prioritizing diversity in drug resistance mechanisms was better aligned with this goal compared to exclusive representation by clinically relevant plasmid-borne \u03b2-lactamases. CSP therefore aims to identify a broad range of CS responses to provide broad biological target coverage for large libraries containing diverse chemistries. Secondly, CS screening of complex NP extracts necessitated a simple, minimally-variable genetic background due to the potential for interference. Multi-gene mutants and plasmid-borne resistance vectors contain several points of variability, which together may produce synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions that complicate comparison with the WT strain. Instead, we selected only single gene mutants that would unambiguously connect any observed CS interaction to a specific drug resistance mutation and compound/extract. Thirdly, chromosomal resistance mutations are more genetically stable and therefore more amenable to high-throughput screening. In contrast, plasmid-borne strains may require both retention control (selection antibiotic) and copy control (inducer) to standardize expression, significantly complicating CS screening.", "For CSP, we developed a fully automated 384-well microtiter assay protocol that systematically tests each chemical sample against all 30 test strains (WT\u2009+\u200929 drug-resistant strains; Fig.\u00a01). Each strain was dispensed into clear microtiter plates at a standardized inoculum before treatment with test compounds (either as dilution series for antimicrobial agents or at a single stock concentration for natural product extracts). Compound-treated plates were incubated overnight, and cell growth assessed via OD600 absorbance. The activity of a given test compound/extract against each of the 29 drug-resistant strains was then used to construct an activity \u2018fingerprint\u2019 by standardizing to the activity of the WT strain. Loss of activity in one or more mutant strains compared to the WT signified resistance or cross resistance (CR). Conversely, an increase in activity in one or more mutant strains compared to WT inferred a CS interaction. CSP thus provides a clear and comprehensive examination of the CS properties of any compound library in high throughput.Fig. 1Schematic diagram of collateral sensitivity profiling (CSP).Eighty antimicrobials covering a broad range of drug classes (control set for assay optimization) and an in-house library of 6195 natural product extract prefractions served as the primary source of chemical diversity for this study. Both the antimicrobial control set and the natural product library were systematically screened against wildtype E. coli (WT) and 29 drug-resistant strains (S1\u2013S29) as either dilution series (antimicrobials) or at a single stock concentration (natural product prefractions); growth monitored via OD600 readings.

Each antimicrobial was serially diluted (16 two-fold dilutions from 128\u2009\u03bcM to ~4\u2009nM) and screened in biological triplicate against the full target panel plus WT (average Z\u2019-factor\u2009=\u20090.71, Supplementary Table\u00a03). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for each drug-strain combination were used to calculate fold-change differences (Log2MICMutant\u2009\u2013\u2009Log2MICWT) between WT and drug-resistant strains (Fig.\u00a02; for a fully annotated table with quantified values, see Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). In total, 34 out of 80 antimicrobial compounds induced at least a 2-fold increase in resistance to one or more drug-resistant strains, with the largest difference corresponding to an upwards 256-fold shift in the MIC. As anticipated, resistance and CR among mutant strains were observed for their original selection antibiotic and same-class analogues, respectively. Both chromosomal and plasmid-borne MDR strains exhibited widespread CR patterns across the entire antimicrobial set, notably against \u03b2-lactams, fluoroquinolones, rifamycins, and tetracyclines. Conversely, 43 antimicrobial compounds presented a minimum of 2-fold increase in CS activity to one or more strains; the largest being a downwards 32-fold shift in the MIC. CS activity was generally congruent among same-class analogues. The cephalosporin-resistant cell wall biosynthesis mutants, Cef6 and Cef7, displayed increased sensitivity towards a broad range of antimicrobials, including select fluoroquinolones, rifamycins, select aminoglycosides, macrolides, amphenicols, anthracyclines, and lipopeptides. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have identified a correlation between the frequency of CS interactions and cell wall mutations11. Furthermore, amphenicol antimicrobials presented broad and consistent CS activity in strains with rifamycin and aminoglycoside resistance, as well as plasmid-borne MDR. The CS relationship between chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside-resistant E. coli has been previously reported by Imamovic, et al.10. Here, we show that chloramphenicol\u2019s CS activity can be extrapolated to other amphenicols, which together are also CS-active against select cephalosporin-, fluoroquinolone-, and MDR strains in addition to aminoglycoside-resistant strains. A recent study by Li et al. demonstrated the utility of pleuromutilin antibiotics in treating vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium17. Analogously, CS profiling has shown that the pleuromutilin antibiotic tiamulin presents potent CS activity across the spectrum of drug-resistant E. coli strains. Finally, certain antimicrobials, such as polymyxin B and novobiocin, possessed unique CS activity profiles not shared by their analogues.Fig. 2Collateral sensitivity profiling (CSP) of 80 commercial antimicrobials against a drug-resistant E. coli target panel.Legend: white\u2009=\u2009no change in Log2MIC compared to wildtype; red\u2009=\u2009increase in Log2MIC compared to wildtype (resistance); blue\u2009=\u2009decrease in Log2MIC compared to wildtype (collateral sensitivity).

Natural products have been widely studied in the past as a privileged source of antimicrobial scaffolds27. Our group maintains an in-house library of natural product extract prefractions derived from diverse marine Actinobacterial and terrestrial Burkholderia microorganisms. To investigate the CS potential of this NP library, the entire collection (6195 prefractions) was systematically screened using CSP (185,850 combinations; average Z-factor\u2009=\u20090.55; Supplementary Table\u00a03). Resulting growth data (OD600 absorbance values) for each extract-strain combination were normalized by strain and expressed as a percent difference from the wildtype standard (%GrowthMutant\u2009\u2013 %GrowthWT), then processed through hierarchical clustering to group extracts by their CS phenotype (Fig.\u00a03A). A cut-off of one standard deviation was established to select hits from the primary screen. We rationalized that the lack of additional replicates (due to limited extract material) justified an inclusive primary hit selection approach, given that this was complemented by a comprehensive secondary screen for hit validation.Fig. 3Collateral sensitivity profiling of 6195 natural product extracts.A Hierarchical clustering of 5259 marine-derived Actinobacterial and 936 Burkholderia natural product extract prefractions (vertical axis) profiled against wildtype E. coli and 29 drug-resistant strains (horizontal axis.

Out of 6195 total, 631 extracts (617 Actinobacteria and 14 Burkholderia) displayed CR relationships in at least one drug-resistant strain. A significant portion of the NP library elicited strong resistance from the aminoglycoside-resistant Str4 mutant, while a distinct cluster of extracts experienced CR from several MDR strains (Tet8, Cm2, Cm3), the rifamycin-resistant strains (Rif1, Rif7, Rif11), and one fluoroquinolone-resistant strain (Cip15KB; Fig.\u00a03B). By contrast, the multidrug-resistant marR mutant Cip8 was not susceptible to most extracts, exhibiting few CR or CS interactions. The cephalosporin-resistant cell wall strains (Cef1, Cef6, Cef7, Cef8) produced strong but variable patterns of both CR and CS across the entire natural product library. Uniformity of response between the four related mutant strains was low but the overall potency, either CR or CS, was high in relation to other strains. Some strains were similarly prone to strong CR and/or CS responses, such as the rifamycin-resistant strain Rif1. In total, 1469 extracts (1249 Actinobacteria and 220 Burkholderia) produced CS activity in at least one drug-resistant strain compared to wildtype.", "CS profiles within the dataset fell into four main categories: first, CS in one drug-resistant strain; second, CS in multiple strains with mutations in the same gene; third, CS in multiple resistance genes within the same drug class; and fourth, CS in several drug classes. For example, one major cluster of extracts presented a CS profile that mirrored the CR profile shown in Fig.\u00a03B, with increased activity against select MDR, rifamycin-, and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains (corresponding to category four; Fig.\u00a03C). We also observed a group of extracts with potent CS activity extending across all aminoglycoside-resistant and plasmid-borne MDR strains (corresponding to categories three and four; Fig.\u00a03D). Many extracts that elicited CR in a set of drug-resistant strains also induced CS in other strains, and vice versa. Together, these data suggests that the interaction between drug resistance and CS in natural products, and by extension in nature, is both complex and widespread.", "Hit triage and CS-active natural product discovery", "A subset of 117 hit extracts were selected for follow-up from the primary screen based on the diversity and potency of their CS profiles. These extracts were prepared as half-step dilution series (16 two-fold dilutions) from their stock concentrations and rescreened against the full target panel (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). This secondary assay served to both verify the original CS activity from the primary screen and quantify the magnitude of the CS shift between WT and mutant MICs. Although the absolute concentrations of compounds in each prefraction are unknown, the relative difference in these MIC shifts between WT and drug-resistant strains provided a measure of the strength of the observed CS effect. In all cases, positive fold change values between the MICs indicated CR to the active compounds by the drug-resistant mutant, while negative fold change values indicated the presence of CS interactions. Of the 117 extracts selected for secondary screening, 72 extracts exhibited measurable CS activity with at least a two-fold difference in MIC for at least one drug-resistant strain. 39 out of 72 extracts displayed CS activity only, while 33 extracts presented a combination of CS and CR activities, depending on the drug-resistant strain. No extract exhibited solely CR interactions in the secondary assay.", "The subset of 72 extracts was further triaged based on CS magnitude and profile diversity to give 28 prefractions for downstream chemical investigation. A high-throughput bioactivity-guided fractionation approach, termed the Peak Library system, was adopted to deconvolute these complex mixtures and to identify the active components. Details regarding the Peak Library system are provided in the methods section and have been described in previous work published by our group28. In brief, each extract was separated using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) into 80 discrete subfractions with 0-5 UV \u2018peaks\u2019 per fraction. These 28 peak libraries were then rescreened in a tertiary assay against relevant members of the drug-resistant target panel to identify active metabolites. Active subfractions were evaluated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis to obtain target masses as candidate leads for isolation.", "Discovery, isolation, and characterization of borrelidin natural products with CS activity against cephalosporin-resistant E. coli", "Throughout the triaging process, extract RLUS-1732D displayed particular promise in both the primary and secondary CSP screens. Primary screening data showed strong CS activities localized to the cephalosporin-resistant cell wall mutants, but also mild CS activity across multiple drug classes (Fig.\u00a04A). This activity was recapitulated in the secondary assay, with an 8-fold MIC difference for cephalosporin-resistant strains Cef6 (rfaH W4*) and Cef7 (rfaG E289fs) and 2-fold MIC shifts for Cef1 (envZ T402M), Cef8 (envZ P248S), and several additional strains (Fig.\u00a04B). Peak Library fractionation produced two discrete, bioactive subfractions (F18/F19) that clearly inhibited the growth of strain Cef7 (Fig.\u00a04C). HPLC-UV-MS analysis of these subfractions revealed the presence of a family of related compounds with strong UV absorbance at 260\u2009nm. In total, four bioactive analogues (1, 2, 3, and 4) were isolated from a large-scale culture of the producing organism (RL09-056-NTSA; Streptomyces spp.; Fig.\u00a04D). Using standard HRMS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, compounds 1, 2, and 3 were identified as the known macrolide natural products borrelidin A, F, and H, respectively (Fig.\u00a04E). Compound 4 did not match any entries in the Natural Products Atlas database of microbial natural product structures29, and so was subjected to full de novo structure elucidation using HRMS, 1D, and 2D NMR analyses (Supplementary Table\u00a04). Detailed interpretation of these data identified compound 4 as a new natural product, named borrelidin P. The absolute configuration of this new metabolite was determined through a combination of dipolar coupling NMR experiments and chemical derivatization using the modified Mosher\u2019s ester method30.Fig. 4Discovery, isolation, and characterization of CS-active borrelidins.A Primary screening data and dendrogram of hit extract RLUS-1732D (*).

Compound 1 displayed the strongest CS activity, with 64-fold and 32-fold decreases in its MIC against cephalosporin-resistant strains Cef6 and Cef7, respectively (Fig.\u00a04F). Furthermore, 1 showed a modest but consistent 2-fold decrease in MIC against strain RK2, which houses a well-known MDR plasmid from clinical isolates of Klebsiella aerogenes19. Interestingly, no CS activity was observed in the other two strains hosting MDR plasmids (pAC29 and pAC30), suggesting that the CS interaction is specific to the resistance genes within RK2. In congruence with both primary and secondary screening results, 1 remained CS-active against other cephalosporin-resistant strains Cef1 and Cef8, as well as fluoroquinolone-resistant strain Cip2KB (gyrB L509G) and aminoglycoside-resistant strain Kn15 (ubiF Q120*). However, the potency of these CS activities was reduced, with only 2- to 4-fold shifts in the IC50 (instead of full inhibition) depending on the strain (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03A). Compounds 2 and 3 also displayed weak CS activity compared to 1, with 4-fold and 2-fold decreases in MIC against Cef7, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03B, C). Lastly, 4 produced an intermediate 8-fold decrease in MIC against both Cef6 and Cef7 (Fig.\u00a04G).", "Compound 1 was originally discovered due to its antibacterial activity against Borrelia sp., although its antimalarial activity and cytotoxicity have since been reported31,32. Mechanistic studies have established borrelidin A as a potent inhibitor of threonyl-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (threonine\u2014tRNA ligase) in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic targets33,34. This inhibition is contingent on an unusual nitrile functional group pendant on the macrocyclic core35. Interestingly, 4 displayed CS activity despite the substitution of a primary amide in place of the nitrile group. To test the hypothesis that the observed CS activity of 1 and 4 was related to bacterial threonine\u2014tRNA ligase inhibition, an ASKA library vector containing thrS was transformed into WT, Cef6, and Cef7 E. coli strains. Induction of ThrRS overexpression, followed by treatment with 1, resulted in a 32-fold increase in its MIC against strains Cef6 and Cef7 compared to uninduced control (Fig.\u00a04H). This experiment was additionally replicated using 4, where a 2-fold increase in MIC was observed for strains Cef6 and Cef7, compared to uninduced control (Fig.\u00a04I). These results support the notion that ThrRS is the primary target of borrelidins in E. coli in the context of CS. However, it is unclear if ThrRS inhibition is the only mechanism of borrelidin activity as 4 lacks the key nitrile moiety needed for target binding but remains bioactive in strains Cef6 and Cef7. ThrRS overexpression also failed to fully revert the activities of compounds 1 and 4 back to WT levels; instead, the Hill slope curve for both compounds exhibited a shallower slope suggesting increased CS vulnerability at concentrations immediately below the MIC. Interestingly, ThrRS overexpression under identical conditions produced different effects on the MICs of 1 and 4.The existence of multiple biological targets for the borrelidin family have been previously reported, including by our group, in multiple disease models (cyclin-dependent kinase in yeast and lactate dehydrogenase in Plasmodium sp.)32,35. Our results suggest that additional targets may exist in bacteria as well, and that this activity is magnified in select drug resistance phenotypes.", "Borrelidin A and ceftazidime are not synergistic in E. coli", "We next sought to investigate whether the CS activity of the borrelidins was synergistic with the cephalosporin antimicrobial ceftazidime. Both Cef6 and Cef7 strains were selected on ceftazidime and have been determined to carry mutations that affect the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway. These mutations confer resistance against cephalosporins but also increased sensitivity to borrelidins in a CS context. We reasoned that the presence of ceftazidime in the WT strain may improve borrelidin activity (possibly through permeabilization) and vice versa (borrelidins destabilizing cell wall biosynthesis), thereby producing a synergistic interaction. To that end, ceftazidime and 1 (the most potent borrelidin analogue) were screened together using two-dimensional checkerboard assays against WT, Cef7, and the MDR RK2 strains. The \u03b2-lactam antibiotic ampicillin was used as a control for ceftazidime. Resulting absorbance data were normalized as percent growth values, with the combination of the lowest compound concentrations resulting in at least 50% inhibition of growth used to calculate the fractional inhibitory index (FIC). In WT E. coli, ceftazidime in conjunction with 1 produced strong additive interactions (FIC\u2009=\u20090.56) but not synergy (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04A). The same was true for 1 with ampicillin (FIC\u2009=\u20090.63). Screening in the cephalosporin-resistant strain Cef7 reproduced the expected CS interaction: decreased activity for ceftazidime but increased activity for 1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04B). However, the FIC remained unchanged (0.5), as was the case for 1 with ampicillin (FIC\u2009=\u20090.5). Lastly, we tested the MDR strain RK2 as a CS control that do not possess cell wall resistance mutations; an additive interaction was again observed (FIC\u2009=\u20091; Supplementary Fig.\u00a04C). These data suggest that the borrelidins\u2019 CS activity is not an extension of synergy with ceftazidime but is instead the result of the presence specific mutations causing cephalosporin resistance.", "Cef6/7 mutations do not increase intracellular concentrations of borrelidin A", "To test the hypothesis that borrelidin CS activity is due to greater permeabilization in the cell wall biosynthesis mutants, we next performed a mass spectrometry-based compound accumulation study. Cef6 and Cef7 strains, as well as WT, were separately incubated with either vehicle, borrelidin A (1), or mupirocin (a control compound that also inhibits protein synthesis via isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase) at their respective IC50 for 10\u2009min. Cells of each strain/treatment condition were harvested, with the vehicle control serving to demonstrate specificity of selection product ion transitions. Following the removal of cell culture supernatants, cells were lysed to permit absolute quantification of internalized compounds by targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). LC-MS-based quantification revealed no statistically significant increase in the intracellular concentration of 1 between the three strains (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). Nor was there a difference in the extracellular or intracellular concentrations of the mupirocin control. The increased antimicrobial activity of 1 observed in strains Cef6 and Cef7 is therefore not the result of increased internalization, further supporting the existence of additional biological targets for this family of compounds.", "Ceftazidime-borrelidin A co-dosing regimen limits emergence of ceftazidime\u00a0resistance in E. coli", "One potential application of CS agents is to co-dose them with the corresponding antimicrobial for which resistant strains show CS behavior. In this application, the CS drug would act as an adjuvant to eliminate evolving drug-resistant populations. To investigate this application, we tested the ability of 1 to limit the emergence of cephalosporin resistance in E. coli under increasing drug pressure. WT K-12 MG1655 was subjected to four separate drug treatments: ceftazidime alone, ceftazidime with 1 at 32\u2009\u03bcM, ceftazidime with 1 at 128\u2009\u03bcM, and ceftazidime with norfloxacin as a negative control (no CS relationship with ceftazidime-resistant strains). Cultures were passaged daily under increasing concentrations of ceftazidime, based on MIC values. Figure\u00a05A illustrates ceftazidime resistance acquisition over time under each of these four conditions. Treatment with ceftazidime alone resulted in a steady increase in MIC over the first 9 days, followed by a significant increase to 8\u2009\u03bcM MIC on the 10th day, surpassing the EUCAST36 breakpoint for ceftazidime resistance in E. coli (>4\u2009\u03bcM). Co-dosing with 1 at 32\u2009\u03bcM (1/8th its MIC in WT E. coli) marginally suppressed the average MIC compared to ceftazidime alone and prevented resistance from reaching the EUCAST breakpoint for 12 days. Increasing 1 treatment concentration to 128\u2009\u03bcM (its IC50 in WT E. coli) reduced resistance by up to 4-fold compared to ceftazidime alone and stabilized resistance between 1 to 2\u2009\u03bcM for up to 12 days. In contrast, co-dosing ceftazidime with norfloxacin failed to significantly suppress the emergence of ceftazidime resistance, reaching the breakpoint as early as the 9th day (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06).Fig. 5Sublethal doses of borrelidin A slow the emergence of cephalosporin resistance in wildtype E. coli.A Ceftazidime MIC values as determined through sequential passaging of wildtype E. coli MG1655 over twelve days under increasing ceftazidime drug pressure, either alone (red; Cef), with an increasing concentration of norfloxacin (black; Nor), with a constant concentration of 1 at 32\u2009\u00b5M (light blue), or with a constant concentration of 1 at 128\u2009\u00b5M (blue).

After 12 days, ceftazidime drug pressure resulted in a 20-fold increase in MIC for ceftazidime, but also a 24-fold increase in CR to cefaclor, highlighting the prevalence of intra-class cross-resistance. Ceftazidime treatment also produced CS behavior with 1, demonstrating the reproducibility of this interaction. Co-dosing with 1 at 32\u2009\u03bcM reduced ceftazidime and cefaclor resistances to 8-fold MIC and 15-fold MIC, respectively. Increasing the concentration of 1 to 128\u2009\u03bcM reduced cephalosporin resistance even further, to 5-fold MIC for ceftazidime and negligible increase for cefaclor. Co-dosing with norfloxacin, however, failed to change ceftazidime resistance significantly (19-fold MIC) but greatly exacerbated cefaclor CR (37-fold MIC), illustrating one of the risks of ineffective co-dosing selection. Norfloxacin treatment furthermore produced mild resistance towards the two fluoroquinolone compounds. Yet, resistance against 1 was not observed for any treatment with 1; a mild CS interaction was instead detected with the fluoroquinolones. These results conclude that borrelidin NPs are capable of suppressing the emergence cephalosporin\u00a0resistance in E. coli."]
