["2. Results", "2.1. Identification of the Actinomycin D Biosynthetic Gene Cluster", "To identify the gene cluster, we sequenced the S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073 genomic DNA using a combination of Hiseq 4000 and PacBio smart technologies [27]. S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073 is a mangrove-derived actinomycete which produces antibacterial secondary metabolites such as fungichromin, actinomycin D and actinomycin Xo\u03b2 [27,28]. We analyzed a 39.8 kb region containing 24 open reading frames (ORFs), suspected of coding for actinomycin D biosynthesis. We elucidated the gene organization as shown in Figure 1 and deduced its biosynthetic pathway (Figure 2) along with assigned gene product functions as noted below in Table 1. The gene cluster has been deposited in Genbank (with the accession number of MK234849). A cosmid library of S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073 was constructed using the SuperCos 1 vector system and 2 positive clones (9C2, 9A7) covering the whole gene cluster were screened using targeted gene inactivations.", "2.2. Determination of the Actinomycin D Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Boundaries", "The upstream boundary of the actinomycin D gene cluster was preliminarily determined as being between orf(\u22121) and acnW; the downstream boundary was defined between acnT3 and orf(+1). The orf(\u22121) encodes Type VII secretion system protein EccC. Although orf(\u22121) carries with it the function of enabling secretion, all the inactivation mutants of orf(\u22121) failed to show any differences in actinomycin D production levels compared to wild-type (WT) (SI, Figure S7). The upstream boundary region was further delineated by a set of gene inactivations for orf(\u22121), orf(\u22122) and orf(\u22123). None of the inactivation bearing mutants for these genes displayed discernible differences in actinomycin D biosynthesis rates or yields relative to WT producer (SI, Figure S7). Likewise, the downstream boundary was ascertained by bioinformatic analyses and the application of mutants bearing inactivated orf(+1), orf(+2), orf(+3) genes. Although orf(+1) gene encodes an N-acetyltransferase, it is shown by inactivation experiments, the mutant strains produce the same level of actinomycin D compared to wild type strains. Further evaluations proximal to the downstream boundary revealed that genes corresponding to orf(+2) and orf(+3) encode a hypothetical protein and a two-component hybrid sensor and regulator; comparative analyses of \u2206orf(+2) and \u2206orf(+3) inactivation mutants (vs. WT) revealed that neither of these genes and their respective products play a role in actinomycin D biosynthesis (SI, Figure S7).", "2.3. NRPS Genes for Peptide Chain Assembly in Actinomycin D Biosynthesis", "Following the biosynthesis of 4-MHA, this anthranilic acid derivative, along with other amino acids, by several NRPSs ultimately affording the 4-MHA-pentapeptide halves of actinomycin (Figure 2A). The pentapeptide is composed of five different amino acids: l-threonine, d-valine, l-proline, l-sarcosine and methyl-valine. The genes responsible for peptide chain assembly in S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073 are acnD, acnE, acnN1, acnN2, acnN3. AcnD was found to contain 66 amino acid residues arranged in a manner that resembles the MbtH protein. MbtH-like proteins are found in many NRPS gene clusters [29] and researchers have demonstrated that MbtH-like proteins participate in some adenylation reactions by tightly binding to NRPS proteins containing adenylation domains [30,31]. MbtH-like proteins, such as gene dptG in S. roseosporus participate in the biosynthesis of the cyclic lipotridecapeptide antibiotic daptomycin [32] and mbtH in Mycobacerium spp. responsible for the siderophore biosynthesis [33]. The NRPS gene acnN1 encodes an adenylation domain protein and acnE encoding 4-MHA carrier protein. Two large multidomain NRPSs acnN1 and acnN3 are responsible for peptide chain assembly and release from the NRPS machinery. Gene deletions of acnD + acnE in combination, acnN1 and acnN3 were found to abolish actinomycin D biosynthesis (Figure 3) in the mutant producers bearing these gene inactivations.", "2.4. Biosynthetic Genes of 4-MHA", "We identified a set of genes, designated as acnG, acnH, acnL and acnM, that show high functional similarities to enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 4-MHA, the critical building block of the actinomycin chromophore. These genes are homologous to a set of four counterparts in actinomycin-producing strains S. antibioticus IMRU3720 and S. chrysomallus [17,18]. These genes encode for arylformamidase (acnG), tryptophan-2, 3-dioxygenase (acnH), kynureninase (acnL) and methyltransferase (acnM). The gene acnM shows 88% identities with the 3-hydroxy kynurenine methyltransferase acmL, which is responsible for the methylation of 3-HK [34]. However, the vital step entailing kynurenine conversion to 3-hydroxykynurenine appears to be catalyzed by a kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, the gene for which is not found within the acn gene cluster. Inactivation of acnGHLM in combination, followed by metabolite analysis of the mutant strain revealed that these genes play essential roles in actinomycin D biosynthesis (Figure 3).", "2.5. Regulatory and Self-Resistance Genes", "We identified six genes acnW, acnU4, acnR, acnT1, acnT2 and acnT3 with apparent regulatory and/or protective functions. AcnR encodes a TetR family transcriptional regulator and usually acts as a transcriptional repressor or activator in many biological processes such as cell-cell communication and metabolite regulation [35,36]. TetR family transcriptional regulators belong to a one-component system and generally possess a two-domain structure composed of an N-terminal HTH DNA-binding motif and a C-terminal ligand regulatory domain. Many of these regulators control the expression of transporters, which help bacteria acclimate to their environment [37,38]. In some cases, members of the TetR family suppress the biosynthesis of antibiotics. For instance, disruption of calR3, a TetR family member in the calcimycin BGC, was found to improve calcimycin titers [39]. Moreover, TrdK, which shows high similarity to TetR family members and is involved in tirandamycin production from marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666 was found by gene inactivations, to suppress tirandamycin biosynthesis; trdK inactivation led to dramatically improved tirandamycin titers [40]. The inactivation of acnR completely abolished actinomycin D production, consistent with this gene\u2019s essential role as a and important positive regulator of actinomycin D biosynthesis (Figure 3, trace viii). Gene acnW is located downstream of the boundary gene orf(\u22121) and appears to encode for a hypothetical protein; acnW disruption impaired, but did not abolish, production of actinomycin D. The gene acnU4 also encodes a hypothetical protein and, as with acnW, inactivation of acnU4 correlates to diminished actinomycin D production (Figure 3). On the basis of these findings, AcnW and AcnU4 appear to function as positive regulators of actinomcyin D production although the structural families to which they belong are not yet apparent. AcnO encodes a LmbU-like protein. LmbU is a regulatory gene involved in licomycin biosynthesis in S. lincolnensis 78-11. It always contains a TTA codon close to the N-terminal end of its ORF. The codon is often found in genes involved in the regulation of differentiation or secondary metabolism [41], in neither case is a specific role in actinomycin D assembly known, S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073 inactivation mutant strain of \u2206acnO was not able to produce even trace amounts of actinomycin D (Figure 3, traces ix). Thus, acnO might serve as a positive regulator in actinomycin D biosynthetic pathway.", "Beyond these gene\u2013function correlations, we also identified three putative transporter genes acnT1, acnT2 and acnT3. The acnT1 gene is predicted to encode an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter which uses the energy of ATP to transport molecules through the membrane. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that acnT2 encodes a multidrug ABC transporter permease whereas acnT3 encodes a UvrA-like protein, which is a DNA binding protein involved in the excision repair of DNA. Somewhat surprisingly, inactivations of acnT1 acnT2 and acnT3 all produced mutant strains able to generate actinomycin D with efficiencies rivaling those seen with the WT producer (Figure 3). Consequently, we concluded that these three transporter genes are not necessary in actinomycin D biosynthesis.", "2.6. Nonessential Genes of Unknown within the acn Cluster", "The BGC for actinomycin D in S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073 houses a number of genes not associated with actinomycin D assembly. For instance, close to the upstream boundary reside genes acnA and acnB; all of these encode for hypothetical proteins. Additionally, acnU1, acnU2, acnU3 also encode for proteins whose functions have not been deciphered and whose roles in actinomycin D construction appear nonessential. Inactivations for all these genes have no impact on actinomycin D biosynthesis relative to WT production efficiencies (Figure 4). Bioinformatics have revealed that acnC resides between acnU2 and acnU3 and codes for an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. This gene\u2019s inactivation also appears to have no impact upon actinomycin D synthesis compared to the WT strain. This too is the case for acnQ. Located downstream of the acnR, acnQ was proposed, based on bioinformatics, to code for a siderophore-interacting protein. Such small molecule siderophore-interacting systems often constitute transport systems by which microbes control intracellular concentrations of specific secondary metabolites. As with the other genes noted however, inactivation of acnQ was found to have no bearing whatsoever on actinomycin D production compared to the WT producer (Figure 4).", "2.7. Cytochrome P450 Gene acnP Is Responsible for the Hydroxylation of Proline in Actinomycin Xo\u03b2", "X-type actinomycins contain 4-hydroxyproline (actinomycin Xo\u03b2) or 4-oxoproline (actinomycin X2) in their \u03b2-pentapeptide lactone rings whereas their \u03b1-ring contains proline. Previous studies demonstrated the importance of a 4-oxoproline synthase within the actinomycin BGC of S. antibioticus. This enzyme catalyzes proline oxidation in each of the actinomycin halves (prior to dimerization) to form 4-hydroxyproline or 4-oxoproline; condensation of each of the hydroxylated actinomycin halves affords actinomycin Xo\u03b2 or actinomycin X2 [42]. Within the actinomycin BGC in S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073, we identified a cytochrome P450 gene, acnP, that encodes a 436 aa protein. We hypothesized that AcnP is responsible for proline hydroxylation en route to actinomycin Xo\u03b2. This speculation was validated by targeted inactivation of acnP; fermentations and metabolite analyses of the \u2206acnP mutant revealed the complete abrogation of actinomycin Xo\u03b2 production and concomitant production of actinomycin D with titers rivaling those seen with the WT producer (Figure 5). These data make clear that AcnP is responsible for the 4-oxoproline found in actinomycin Xo\u03b2.", "The PHS gene outside the acn cluster is not necessary for actinomycin D biosynthesis. PHS has been presumed to catalyze the oxidative condensation of two 4-MHA-pentapeptide lactone \u201cmonomers\u201d in the last step of actinomycin D biosynthesis. Previous studies had, in fact, demonstrated that PHS is involved in a variety of enzymatic condensations of ortho-aminophenols to form phenoxazinones. Within the genome of S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073, we identified a phs orf encoding a 627 aa, two copper-containing phenoloxidase separated from the actinomycin biosynthetic cluster by 5.77 Mbp. This phs gene shows sequence similarity (84% identity) to phsA in S. antibioticus IMRU3720. To validate this gene\u2019s involvement in actinomycin D assembly, we generated a \u2206phs mutant strain and assessed its biosynthetic capacity relative to the WT producer. Surprisingly, phs inactivation in the S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073 strain had no detectable impact upon actinomycin D production relative to the WT producer (Figure 4). This result is consistent with the previous gene inactivation result for phsA in S. antibioticus IMRU3720 [26] and indicated also, that for S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073 actinomycin D assembly does not appear to require a PHS.", "acnF is essential to actinomycin D biosynthesis. Within the actinomycin cluster, acnF encodes for a hypothetical protein with 212 aa. Gene inactivation for acnF, revealed that acnF is indispensable for actinomycin D construction (Figure 4). S. costaricanus SCSIO ZS0073 inactivation mutant strain of \u2206acnF was not able to produce even trace amounts of actinomycin D (Figure 4, traces x), thus showcasing the importance of its gene products to actinomycin D biosynthesis. We proposed acnF might be involved in the dimerization of the 4-MHA-pentapeptide monomer en route to actinomycin (Figure 2). Efforts to identify the exact roles played by acnF products are currently ongoing and will be reported in due course."]
