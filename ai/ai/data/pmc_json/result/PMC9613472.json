["Results", "TM depletes richness and shifts gut taxonomic composition", "We first asked whether the anti-bacterial activity ascribed to TM against single species in vitro may be relevant for the structure and function of the human gut microbiota. Faecal samples from healthy subjects were exposed briefly to a concentration of TM we typically measure in mouse models of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis20. Surviving cells were then cultured anaerobically on differential media to select specific groups of bacteria (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Treatment with TM compared with the ethanol solvent control resulted in significantly fewer colony-forming units (CFU) g\u22121 faeces on the majority of selection media. Strong post-exposure inhibition of Enterobacteriaceae was also observed. We conclude that TM exerts broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against culturable Gram-positive and Gram-negative members of the human faecal microbiota.Fig. 1Anti-bacterial activity of TM against human faecal bacteria.a, Stool samples from healthy donors (n\u2009=\u20099) were exposed to 170\u2009\u00b5M TM or solvent (EtOH), and the indicated bacterial groups were selectively enriched on differential media. b, Treatment of stool samples (n\u2009=\u20096) was repeated with a range of lower TM concentrations (1\u201385\u2009\u00b5M) or EtOH before selection for the indicated bacterial groups.

NS, not statistically significant.", "Source data", "Few quantitative data are available for patients with AAHC, but faecal densities of toxigenic K. oxytoca and K. grimontii ranging from 107 to 108\u2009CFU\u2009g\u22121 have been reported30,31. The analyte levels from just one patient stool sample known to contain 107 viable K. oxytoca\u2009cells\u2009g\u22121 has been published (1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009nmol\u2009g\u22121 TM and 8\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009pmol\u2009g\u22121 TV (wet weight))32. On the basis of these limited data, it is conceivable that expansion of TM-producing bacteria may be generally less pronounced in patients taking antibiotics than in mouse models (109\u20131010\u2009CFU\u2009g\u22121). We therefore lowered the range of TM concentrations tested to match these rare reports. The same stool samples of healthy donors were treated with diluted TM and plated to select the most TM-sensitive bacterial groups (Fig. 1b). Despite inter-individual variation, the genotoxin mediated significant inhibition of the human samples across this range. Moreover, Gram-negative anaerobes and Enterobacteriaceae were suppressed by the lowest 1\u201310\u2009\u00b5M levels that can be extrapolated from the available patient data. TM is thus effective against gut microbes within a quantitative range relevant for human carriers.", "To establish whether TM exerts anti-bacterial activity in the gut ecosystem, we designed a mouse infection experiment using a mutant strain of K. oxytoca. Loss of biosynthesis gene npsB eliminates production of TM and the second product of the pathway, TV, as this is formed by spontaneous condensation of TM and indole12. TM-deficient mutants of K. oxytoca are thus, by default, also TV deficient. TV lacked anti-bacterial activity in previous tests20. Nonetheless, because we cannot eliminate just TM using genetics, we treated samples of murine faecal bacteria with each metabolite separately. Suppression of the murine microbiota was observed with TM (Extended Data Fig. 1b), but TV exposure had no effect (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Therefore, we refer solely to the anti-bacterial activity of TM throughout this report.", "In the murine model (Fig. 2a), we recapitulated the dysbiosis that typically precedes K. oxytoca overgrowth in patients taking \u00df-lactams by adding Curam (amoxicillin/clavulanate) to drinking water. Compared with previous studies33, omission of an anti-inflammatory drug, which acts as an aetiological co-factor in AAHC, minimized epithelial damage (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Mice were inoculated orally 1\u2009day post-Curam with K. oxytoca AHC-6, its \u0394npsB mutant, or this mutant complemented with npsB in trans. Density of K. oxytoca and the quantity of TM in faeces was monitored daily (Fig. 2b). Values for individual animals are presented in Extended Data Fig. 2b\u2013d. Measurable TM was produced rapidly, reaching maxima between 4 and 10\u2009days, then declining until day 14 (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). After this time K. oxytoca persisted in moderate abundance (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2b); thus, it is possible that TM was also present in vivo, albeit under our level of quantitation. TV was detected in the til\u2009+\u2009infection groups but remained under the limit of quantitation throughout the course of infection. 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses of the faecal microbiome at day 6 (Fig. 2c) revealed significantly less richness in both groups carrying genotoxic strains (AHC-6 and complementation) compared with animals colonized with non-producers (\u0394npsB). Moreover, those taxa present in the absence of TM were more evenly distributed than the communities observed in both toxin-producing cohorts (Shannon index; Fig. 2c). The relative abundance of K. oxytoca was generally high in each infection group at day 6 (Extended Data Fig. 2e) but notably lower for non-producers. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Jaccard\u2019s distance revealed that the composition of the communities formed in the presence of genotoxic strains was completely separated from communities free of TM (\u0394npsB) but did not differ significantly from each other (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2f).Fig. 2Genotoxic K. oxytoca reduce richness of the murine gut microbiota.a, Longitudinal study design.

Curam was discontinued on day 13 to reflect a typical course of patient therapy. Caecal content was sampled at day 20 at the study endpoint. During the 7\u2009day post-Curam recovery time, K. oxytoca was suppressed to a relative abundance of less than 1% (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Analysis of alpha-diversity indexes (Fig. 2e) revealed increased richness in all post-antibiotic successions relative to day 6 (Fig. 2c). The only significant variation between observed richness was noted for the complementation group compared with AHC-6 and \u0394npsB (Fig. 2e). However, the Shannon indices increased in the succession, leaving no significant difference between groups (Fig. 2e). Analysis of beta diversity, by contrast, showed that the phylogeny of each successive community diverged significantly from the others (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 2g). The results of this initial experiment thus show that, in the dysbiotic murine intestine, production of TM substantially restricts richness and evenness of the co-resident community while driving phylogenetic change. Moreover, the communities that evolve following antibiotic challenge differ significantly.", "Genotoxin alters bacterial succession post-exposure", "We analysed the longitudinal effects of TM on community structure in detail. Mice were stably colonized with K. oxytoca until day 13 when Curam was withdrawn (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). High faecal concentrations of TM were present from days 3 to 10 (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The impact of Curam on bacterial diversity is illustrated in Fig. 3b. Before treatment, each cohort showed the same high taxonomic richness (Fig. 3b), but reliable datasets were not retrieved for any group on day 0 (24\u2009h post-Curam) (Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013e). Nonetheless, comparison of the total reads retrieved over time showed no lasting reduction or differences between the infection groups (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Notably, K. oxytoca supported comparatively richer communities than the mock control throughout the experiment independently of TM production (Fig. 3b). That finding is consistent with other in vivo studies showing that \u00df-lactamase-producing bacteria, such as K. oxytoca, lower the effective concentration of amoxicillin in the gut and thereby facilitate the growth of susceptible bacteria34,35. Importantly for this analysis, the additional presence of abundant TM at day 6 limited the number of observable features significantly compared with non-producers. This difference was eliminated by day 12 when faecal TM was no longer measured. Richness continued to increase for both colonized groups after day 12, yet the community succession occurring in this timescale remained significantly less diverse following TM exposure (Fig. 3b). Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity measured over this timeframe revealed that TM not only lowered diversity but also significantly shifted the composition of the succession communities (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To reveal phylogenetic differences between these communities, we calculated unweighted-UniFrac distances (Fig. 3c). The PCoA shows that the initial communities in all cohorts before Curam treatment were highly similar. After day 6 of K. oxytoca colonization with and without TM exposure, the composition of the AHC-6- and \u0394npsB-containing communities diverged strongly. By day 19, the composition of the successive bacteria in each cohort recovered some features of the pre-Curam state (Fig. 3d), but remained significantly distinct from each other (Fig. 3c). Recovery towards pre-treatment beta diversity in this timescale was most pronounced in animals carrying the non-genotoxic strain (Fig. 3d).Fig. 3Variance of microbial diversity and composition during TM exposure and in the subsequent community succession.a, Quantification of TM and K. oxytoca in faeces and caecal content (day 20) of mice colonized with AHC-6, \u0394npsB (n\u2009=\u20096 mice per group) or mock control animals (n\u2009=\u20096, no K. oxytoca or TM detected).

Bacteroides was particularly depleted when TM concentrations were highest, consistent with the pronounced suppression of the Bacteroidota in human samples (Fig. 1a,b). Genera amplified by TM included Enterococcus and Clostridium sensu stricto\n1. TM-dependent differences in the post-antibiotic succession also involved mainly members of the Bacteroidota. Bacteroides and Tannerellaceae_g populations expanded to higher relative abundance following TM exposure, while Prevotellaceae UCG-001 and Odoribacter prevailed in the absence of TM (Fig. 3e). Given the observed volatility within the Bacteroidota, we analysed the diversity indexes for this phylum specifically. The initial composition in both cohorts was comparable. yet TM exposure resulted in significantly less richness, reduced evenness and strongly influenced the taxonomic structure of the Bacteroidota present in the succession communities compared with the TM-free cohort over this timescale (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d).", "Taken together, we demonstrated that faecal microbial communities of specific-pathogen-free mice diverged strongly and significantly after a single event of TM exposure. The resulting composition and altered inter-species interactions in turn shifted the trajectory of ecological succession post-exposure. It is intuitive that the impact of TM on the gut ecosystem is contingent upon the initial community structure. Given the complexity and extreme intra- and inter-individual variation in the human gut microbiome, divergent outcomes can be expected for each episode of gut intoxication36,37.", "TM is a mutagen and antagonizes residents of the same niche", "TM\u2019s impact on community composition in the gut may reflect direct suppression of different bacterial populations, consistent with the broad activity range we observed in vitro. Other changes induced by TM may progress through the network of ecological interactions, which will involve species not directly affected. To explore the underlying mechanisms we first introduced a single specific competitor for co-colonization with K. oxytoca in this model. For this purpose, we isolated a strain of E. coli (B13) from the caecal content of a mouse from the antibiotic control group in the preceding experiment (Fig. 2).

The K. oxytoca strains outcompeted E. coli B13Sm generally. However, toxin producers reached significantly higher competitive indices in the dual infection than non-producers (Fig. 4c,d). This finding agrees well with the previous experiments where higher relative abundances of genotoxic K. oxytoca (wild type and complementation group) than non-producers were attained in mice following the peak of TM production (Extended Data Figs. 2e and 4b). We conclude that TM confers producing strains an ecological advantage.", "To distinguish whether the negative impact on E. coli observed in vivo resulted from a direct interaction with TM, we focused next on TM\u2019s genotoxic activity. TM is a DNA-alkylating agent with a preference for N2 of guanine25; thus, genome-wide lesions can be expected, resulting in some cases in reduced fitness or increased mortality. Mammalian cells exposed to TM activate a DNA damage response, accumulate lesions and undergo genome fragmentation and apoptosis20. Bacteria react to DNA damage with the conserved SOS stress response. The repair processes involve error-prone DNA polymerases, which typically cause elevated mutation rates38,39. We reasoned that, if the TM-mediated inhibition of E. coli was direct, we should detect a TM-dependent increase in mutations occurring in vivo. Mutation is a major mechanism driving antibiotic resistance emergence in bacteria40. We therefore monitored de novo emergence of rifampicin resistance (RifR) in E. coli B13Sm during gut passage. Resistance emerged more frequently in animals colonized with genotoxin producers (n\u2009=\u200911) compared with non-producers (n\u2009=\u200910) (Fig. 4e,f). In this in vivo model we would not expect RifR\nE. coli to undergo positive selection. The numbers of mutants isolated from the \u0394npsB infection group remained stable over time, supporting our premise. The significant rise in RifR over time detected with AHC-6 therefore probably reflects the continuous emergence of new resistance. The mutation spectrum observed in rpoB genes of resistant faecal isolates was diverse with or without TM production (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Table 1). The overlap in these single base-pair substitutions may reflect the background of \u2018pre-exposure\u2019 mutations occurring in vivo during Curam treatment. The high number of G:C to A:T transitions occurring at position 1,546 during TM exposure in vivo (136/189 alleles) identifies the predominant \u2018post-exposure\u2019 signature. This substitution in sequence context TGGAC agrees well with the preferred reactivity of TM with guanines flanked by purines25. The absence of this signature in resistant alleles generated without luminal TM adds evidence that resistance emergence observed with murine hosts indeed reflects intestinal events and not the in vitro selection (Supplementary Table 1).", "DNA damage drives TM-dependent resistance emergence", "Although TM-mediated genotoxicity very likely underlies the observed mutational emergence, it is also known that some bacteria respond to low levels of antibiotics with induction of SOS and the general stress response, reactive oxygen stress and a hypermutator phenotype irrespective of the drugs\u2019 molecular targets29,41\u201344. To characterize the E. coli response to TM in detail, we recapitulated the mutational processes in vitro. E. coli K12 strain MG1655 or this strain carrying a fused recA promoter\u2013green fluorescent protein (PrecA-gfp) reporter plasmid was cultured aerobically in concentrations of TM corresponding to peak in vivo levels or below, or with a ciprofloxacin control (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Cirz et al.39 showed that repair of ciprofloxacin-mediated DNA damage results in derepression of SOS-regulated polymerases, which in turn generate resistance-conferring mutations39. Significant induction of PrecA was observed with subinhibitory levels of TM (42\u2009\u00b5M) and in ciprofloxacin controls. To assess whether subinhibitory TM treatment could induce target-independent DNA damage in E. coli, we assayed for increased intracellular oxidative stress using reporter fusions of the promoters of sodA, katG and soxR. Although the paraquat control was able to stimulate these redox-sensitive promoters, TM did not (Extended Data Fig. 5c\u2013e). Significantly more RifR emerged in E. coli treated with all concentrations of TM tested compared with controls (Extended Data Fig. 5f).Fig. 5K. oxytoca immunity gene uvrX alleviates DNA stress ectopically.a, Calculated AUC values for growth (left) and fluorescence intensity (right) of E. coli MG1655 [pUA66-PrecA-gfp] cultured for 15\u2009h in CASO medium supplemented with TM or ciprofloxacin (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b).

We tested the hypothesis that a self-resistance determinant (uvrX) co-localized on the til genomic island in K. oxytoca should effectively protect E. coli from TM-mediated DNA damage. Structural modelling of UvrX encoded directly upstream of the til biosynthesis genes predicted a folded protein most similar to UvrA2 from Deinococcus radiodurans (PDB ID: 2VF7). Deletion of the E. coli homologue uvrA induced hypersensitivity to TM (Fig. 5b). Ectopic expression of the putative resistance gene uvrX in the \u0394uvrA mutant indeed increased survival to TM significantly. Moreover, the frequency of TM-dependent RifR emergence in vitro was reduced 25-fold by uvrX (Fig. 5c). Notably, however, it was not significantly altered by overexpression of the E. coli homologue uvrA. The mutator phenotype driven by general antibiotic-induced stress arises in part owing to RpoS-dependent downregulation of mismatch DNA repair efficiency42. Although restoring MutS levels has been shown to lower mutation rates caused by several antibiotics, no significant change in TM-dependent resistance emergence occurred by overproducing MutS in E. coli (Fig. 5c). These findings indicate that the self-resistance determinant UvrX is better adapted to alleviate TM-mediated genotoxicity than general DNA repair pathways.", "The sum of these findings supports the conclusion that TM generates mutational resistance mainly via direct DNA damage rather than target-independent pathways.", "Mutational evolution of pathogenic strains", "Our findings show that TM producers have the capacity to antagonize competitors with mutational burden. Direct outcomes of those interactions can include the rise of genetic variants and spread of mutant alleles in commensal and pathogenic strains alike. As gastrointestinal populations are sources for infections46, the clinical implications are manifold. To underline this point empirically, we next asked whether the TM-dependent evolution of resistance observed with E. coli in vivo and in vitro could also be detected in opportunistic pathogens, specifically members of the ESKAPE group, which is responsible for most nosocomial infections47\u201349. Mutational evolution of these pathogens during colonization has implications for tissue invasion, systemic dissemination and antibiotic resistance emergence. Faecal isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa J17 and Klebsiella pneumoniae J10 originating from the human donors sampled in (Fig. 1) and murine isolate B13 were treated with TM in vitro to determine the concentrations causing 50% lethality in 2\u2009h (LC50) (Extended Data Fig. 6a) and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Concentrations at or below the LC50 were used alone and in combination with Curam to promote genetic variation (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Resistance to rifampicin and nalidixic acid in E. coli B13 and in K. pneumoniae J10 emerged as a result (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Exposure of P. aeruginosa isolate J17 to TM also added another resistance determinant to a human isolate already endowed with multiple antibiotic resistances (Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 2). These findings verify that opportunistic pathogens exposed to TM sustain mutations.", "Expansion of the reservoir of resistance determinants in vivo may cause colonized patients to shed multi-resistant opportunistic pathogens in health care settings. Outbreaks of resistant pathogens may also result from their direct selection through antibiotic interventions. To model these scenarios, we performed a dual infection study (Fig. 6a) in the mouse combining K. pneumoniae J10 with toxigenic (n\u2009=\u20094) or mutant \u0394npsB K. oxytoca (n\u2009=\u20094). Like K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae is intrinsically resistant to \u00df-lactams. It persists in the host under the same dysbiotic conditions and competes with K. oxytoca for niche occupation50. We sought to keep the number of colonizing K. pneumoniae low by administering mice 100-fold fewer J10 than K. oxytoca. When competing with toxin-deficient \u0394npsB bacteria, K. pneumoniae colonized all mice within 24\u2009h. By contrast, when TM was produced in the intestine, establishment of K. pneumoniae was delayed for 3\u20135\u2009days in some animals (n\u2009=\u20092) (Fig. 6b). RifR was not detected in faecal K. pneumoniae of either cohort for 6\u2009days (Fig. 6c). To capture rare K. pneumoniae mutants that may have emerged, we changed the antibiotic intervention from Curam to rifampicin. All mice (n\u2009=\u20094) in the toxigenic cohort excreted RifR\nK. pneumoniae within 24\u201348\u2009h. In contrast only one mouse of the toxin-free cohort shed RifR\nK. pneumoniae after 72\u2009h of direct selection. The mutation spectrum of resistance-conferring rpoB alleles associated with each cohort is shown in Fig. 6d. The identical signature mutation for TM observed previously in E. coli (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Table 1) was also observed in K. pneumoniae after in vivo exposure. Those alleles emerging from the gut in the absence of TM carried a different single nucleotide substitution in a distinct sequence context (Fig. 6d).Fig. 6Cytotoxic K. oxytoca drives resistance emergence of K. pneumoniae in vivo.a, Dual-antibiotic treatment study design.

Shown is CFU\u2009g\u22121 for each mouse; orange triangles, same sample as in b. e, Mutation spectrum in rpoB of RifR\nK. pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u200936 versus n\u2009=\u200910 alleles) isolated from TM-exposed and TM-free mice, respectively. Guanine at position 1,546 and adenine 1,547 (yellow highlight) were the predominant post-exposure substitutions.", "Source data", "We conclude that outgrowth of genotoxic Klebsiella during antibiotic therapy increased gene mutation frequency in the gut and promoted mutational evolution of colonizing opportunistic pathogens and emergence of de novo resistance. In sum, these findings show that genotoxin TM influences the evolution of the gut microbiota not just by imposing selection pressures upon it, but by altering the mechanisms of evolution."]
