["2. Results", "The pilot EPfB chemical library was prepared following the workflow presented in the upper panel of Figure 1. This workflow was directed towards the induction of cryptic BGCs in deep-sea bacteria under laboratory conditions, aiming to appraise the vast chemical diversity that can be provided by a bacterial collection. EPfB library\u2019s content and relevance were then assessed (Figure 1, bottom panel) using state-of-the-art cheminformatic methods and biological assays.", "The steps for the construction of the EPfB library started from the test and selection of chemical elicitors and culture conditions, using the new elicitation test reported in Section 2.1.2. Once selected, bacteria were grown in the presence or absence of the chemical elicitors using large-scale cultivation (Section 2.1.3). Metabolites were extracted and fractionated by preparative HPLC. The EPfB library was assembled in screening plates, containing 18 crude extracts and 162 enriched fractions (total = 180 samples), aiming the evaluation of chemical elicitation and library pre-fractionation on the production and detection of novel or bioactive bacterial metabolites.", "The entire EPfB chemical library was evaluated in four biological assays, returning four fractions confirmed as bioactive in these assays (Section 2.2.4).", "For investigation of the library\u2019s chemical composition, high-resolution LC-MS/MS data were acquired from all the samples of the EPfB library. LC-MS/MS data were processed with the NP3 MS workflow, which returned the [M + H]+ spectra relative to bacterial metabolites detected from individual EPfB library\u2019s samples (please see Methods for details). The [M + H]+ spectra were further dereplicated against available spectra databases of known natural products (GNPS and UNPD-ISDB), returning possible chemical structures representing the bacterial metabolites contained in the EPfB library.", "The collection of annotated [M + H]+ spectra was counted according to their detection in each sample group (control vs. elicited vs. both; crude extract vs. enriched fractions), and further for their identification against spectra databases (identified vs. non-identified spectra). This was done aiming to numerically dissect the overall contribution of bacterial elicitation and crude extract fractionation on the production and detection of bacterial metabolites, respectively, and further on the novelty of the library (Section 2.2.1).", "The annotated [M + H]+ spectra collection was further visualized using spectra similarity molecular networking (SSMN) and principal component analysis (PCA). SSMN was used to organize the EPfB spectra in terms of similarity, allowing for the visualization of clusters of similar metabolites (possible analogues or compound families) and further to overview the distribution of the elicited metabolites across the similarity clusters (Section 2.2.3). The distribution of the identified metabolites could also be visualized in the SSMN (represented as squares in Section 2.2.3).", "PCA was used with four main objectives: (i) to compare the chemical space of identified compounds of the EPfB library with known natural products and approved drugs (Section 2.2.4); (ii) to map the contribution of non-identified analogues (non-identified spectra, however directly connected to an identified node in the SSMN\u2014Section 2.2.5); (iii) for dissecting the influence of chemical elicitors on the chemical space covered by the EPfB library (Section 2.2.5); and (iv) the contribution of minor compounds (detected only in enriched fractions) to the chemical space covered by the EPfB library (Section 2.2.5).", "Additionally, we used the established workflow for analyzing the contribution of each strain to the EPfB library, and the influence of chemical elicitors in individual strains. These analyses are presented as Supplementary Materials.", "2.1. Construction of the Elicited Pre-Fractionated Bacterial (EPfB) Chemical Library", "2.1.1. Collection of Deep-Sea Bacteria", "For the construction of the EPfB chemical library, bacterial strains were selected from a collection of isolated deep-sea marine microorganisms, the LAMA collection, maintained at the University of Itajai Valley (Univali-SC) and curated by Professors Andr\u00e9 Oliveira de Souza Lima and Marcus Adonai Castro da Silva. This collection is potentially one of the major sources of substances that are still under-explored in the context of the discovery of bioactive natural compounds. Nineteen strains from the LAMA collection were chosen for the purposes of this pilot study. These strains belong to the Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla.", "2.1.2. Implementation of a New Method for Testing Growth Conditions and Chemical Elicitors for Bacterial Natural Product Library Construction", "Determination of the best growth condition is essential for inducing the production of chemically diverse metabolites by a given bacteria. Therefore, optimal culture conditions were selected based on bacterial population density for each strain and the tested chemical elicitors. The tests were performed with eight reported chemical elicitors: procaine and sodium butyrate, known for their epigenetic action in bacteria by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferases [25] and histone deacetylase (HDAC) [17], respectively; ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin sulfate, which are antibiotics and were selected aiming to mimic the presence of natural competitors; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a known elicitor of a variety of bacterial metabolites with effects at the transcriptional level [14]; and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a metal chelator used with the intention to induce the production of bacterial siderophores or other metabolites. The effect of elicitor concentration was also evaluated, resulting in a total of 17 different elicited conditions tested for each strain (8 chemical elicitors tested in at least 2 concentrations, streptomycin sulfate being tested at 3 concentrations due to positive previous results in our group at the selected concentrations).", "The preliminary tests were evaluated according to visible morphological changes caused by the elicitor addition to solid media in the presence of a bacterial film. The classification of these alterations was qualitative, performed by evaluating the morphology of colonies and classifying each elicitor according to the alterations it caused. Furthermore, each of the 19 bacterial strains was evaluated at three different population densities (2, 17 and 24 h of preculture, optic densities at 600 nm varying from OD600 0.2 to OD600 5.0 a.u.), accounting for 969 tested cultivation conditions (19 strains, 17 elicited conditions and 3 pre-culture densities). For a better presentation of the results, the data were plotted in a matrix representing the observed morphological changes in different colors (Figure 2).", "In this matrix, it is clear that some bacterial strains (rows) presented high susceptibility to morphological changes with different chemical elicitors and concentrations (columns). The antibiotics chloramphenicol and ampicillin were lethal for most bacterial strains at the highest concentration. However, at sublethal concentrations, resistance (e.g., LAMA610, LAMA639, B001_701, B003_789) or changes in colony morphology (e.g., LAMA627, LAMA637) were observed, potentially indicating the modulation of bacterial metabolism. Some strains, such as LAMA627, LAMA639, B003_789 and LAMA915, were highly susceptible to the tested elicitors, presenting morphological changes in almost all the tests performed. The population density also influenced the morphological changes, as can be observed for the strain LAMA915, that showed distinct responses to different elicitors depending on the populational density, more significantly at the highest densities (17 h and 24 h of pre-cultures).", "The tests on solid media were designed to be an easy and low-cost method for initial investigation of the culture condition, elicitor effect on bacterial response and, possibly, on secondary metabolite production. Once validated, this test can be easily implemented, guiding the selection of bacterial strains and elicitation conditions for preparing bacterial natural product libraries.", "2.1.3. Preparation of the EPfB Chemical Library", "Based on the results presented in Figure 2, LAMA627 (ampicillin 100 \u00b5g/mL), LAMA639 (kanamycin 100 \u00b5g/mL), B002_754 (EDTA 10 mM), B003_789 (EDTA 10 mM), B004_912 (EDTA 10 mM), LAMA915 (procaine 100 \u00b5M; ampicillin 100 \u00b5g/mL and EDTA 10 mM) and LAMA585 (sodium butyrate 50 \u00b5M; ampicillin 100 \u00b5g/mL and EDTA 10 mM) were selected for large scale cultivation (400 mL), along with a control growth condition for each strain prepared in the absence of elicitors (controls). Bacterial crude extracts were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC, rendering 9 fractions each. Crude extracts and fractions were assembled into a pilot screening library composed of 180 samples (18 crude extracts and 162 enriched fractions), plus 18 culture media.", "The EPfB library was then analyzed by LC-MS/MS for evaluation of its chemical composition. The library was further tested in four bioassays: proteasome inhibition, triple-negative breast cancer cell-based assay targeted for glutaminase inhibition, and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial growth inhibition.", "2.2. Chemical Composition of the EPfB Chemical Library", "LC-MS/MS data from all samples were jointly processed using the NP3 MS workflow (vide Methods), aiming to determine the chemical composition of the collection, as well as the contribution of chemical elicitation and crude extract fractionation to the detected chemical diversity of the EPfB library. For this, the MS/MS consensus spectra relative to the putative [M + H]+ ions were extracted and globally analyzed using molecular networking. These spectra were further compared to external MS/MS databases for initial metabolite identification, and unmatched spectra were associated to the novelty of the chemical collection. The identified compounds were additionally used for mapping the chemical diversity and the biological relevance of the EPfB library.", "2.2.1. Global Analysis of the Bacterial Metabolites Contained in the EPfB Library", "The LC-MS/MS dataset processed from the 180 library samples resulted in the detection of 1137 MS/MS [M + H]+ consensus spectra linked to unique bacterial metabolites (Figure 3a). The elicited conditions contributed to 45% (514/1137) of these metabolites, which were exclusively detected in samples from bacterial cultures grown in the presence of the chemical elicitors and would not be observed under typical growth conditions. At the same time, 24% (271/1137) of the bacterial metabolites were only found in the control exclusive conditions, being thus downregulated in the presence of chemical elicitors. Finally, about 31% (352/1137) of the metabolites were detected in both control and elicited samples of the EPfB library, thus not being influenced by chemical elicitors.", "EDTA and ampicillin were used for eliciting 5 and 3 strains respectively, being the chemical elicitors that most contributed to the total number of elicited metabolites, each representing an average of 50 new metabolites per strain (Figure 3b). Kanamycin, procaine and sodium butyrate were used in individual strains, further adding elicited metabolites to the collection. Sodium butyrate contributed with the highest number of metabolites per strain, eliciting 82 and adding 53 new compounds to the elicited group.", "Next, we analyzed the impact of crude extract fractionation on the detection of bacterial metabolites by LC-MS/MS. Most of the detected compounds were found exclusively in fractions (1047/1137\u201492%), being those missed in the crude extracts (Figure 3c). On the other hand, very few (n = 6) compounds were missed by fractionating the crude extracts. In addition, a comparative analysis of crude extracts and fractions revealed that potentially novel compounds (669/713\u201494%) were exclusively found in the fractions (Figure 3c). Furthermore, ~97% of the compounds were detected exclusively in the elicited (497/514) or control groups (265/271), and 81% (285/352) of the common compounds (found in both, control and elicited growth conditions) were only found in the fractions (Figure 3d). Metabolites detected exclusively in the fractionated samples probably represent minor or low ionization energy molecules, for which the detection could be suppressed during LC-MS/MS data acquisition from highly complex samples, such as crude extracts. These minor compounds were evidenced in the enriched fractions and were modulated by chemical elicitation, as they were mostly found in the elicited or control exclusive fractions.", "2.2.2. Compound Novelty Introduced by Eliciting Bacterial Cultures", "The [M + H]+ consensus spectra retrieved with the NP3 MS workflow data process were compared to GNPS [23] and to UNPD-ISDB [24] databases. From the 1137 spectra related to bacterial metabolites, 424 (37%) matched with MS/MS spectra of known natural products. Considering that UNPD-ISDB alone contains 213,210 out of the ~300,000 natural products already reported, it is possible that the remaining 713 (63%) non-identified spectra found in the EPfB library represent novel bacterial metabolites (Figure 3a).", "The elicited conditions added 49% (348/713) of the novel MS/MS spectra. In terms of relative novelty, 68% (348/514) of the spectra found exclusively in the elicited conditions are unmatched with databases versus 62% (167/271) of the spectra exclusive to control, and 56% (198/352) of the common spectra (found in both control and elicited conditions)\u2014Figure 3a, showing that chemical elicitors could mostly modulate the expression of novel bacterial metabolites.", "2.2.3. Chemical Diversity of the EPfB Library", "The chemical diversity of the library was initially assessed by the visualization of the SSMN, which is based on the pairwise spectra similarity between the [M + H]+ consensus spectra extracted from the library (Figure 4). The molecular network is organized into clusters of similar spectra, each cluster representing chemically and structurally related compounds. Figure 4a is organized by cluster size, Figure 4b is organized according to the origin of the sample (elicited, control or both).", "The analysis of the SSMN highlights the contribution of elicitation of bacterial cultures to the chemical diversity of the EPfB library. About 23% of the spectra clusters are composed only of nodes from elicited growth conditions (25/109 of the accounted clusters), potentially introducing new families of natural products (unique clusters) to the collection. Furthermore, elicited exclusive nodes are well distributed across the SSMN (Figure 4, in blue), covering 67% (73/109) of the spectra clusters, possibly contributing to chemical diversity around a given chemical scaffold. In combination with the common nodes (spectra found in both control and elicited conditions), the elicited samples cover about 94% (102/109) of the cluster found in the SSMN.", "It is worth noting that there were clusters exclusively detected in the control conditions (without addition of any chemical elicitor), probably indicating that chemical elicitation also inhibited the production of some classes of bacterial metabolites, which were only detected in the control cultures. Seven small clusters (6% of total clusters) are composed only of nodes from non-elicited samples (Figure 4, in white).", "Interestingly, a large cluster of possible biotransformation products of ampicillin was also found, composed of 16 nodes (large cluster colored blue in Figure 4a). Three bacterial strains were cultivated in the presence of ampicillin: LAMA915, LAMA585 and LAMA627; however, the biotransformation products were mainly found in LAMA915, which is a bacterial strain rich in beta-lactamases (GenBank assembly accession: GCA_001235865.1).", "Four spectra clusters from the SSMN presented in Figure 4 were extracted to exemplify clusters of bioactive and rare natural products present in the library (Figure 5). Despite the identification given by the MS/MS databases used for comparisons, the data were also manually curated. This was done because some factors, such as coherence with the reported origin of the compounds (marine environment or bacterial natural products) and featured isotope occurrence (in case of halogens, for example) are not taken into account by the NP3 MS workflow at this point\u2014or by any other MS/MS dereplication tool that we are aware of\u2014when handling spectra identification. This may lead to erroneous spectra identification, or to difficulties in selecting the right compound from a list of possible identification candidates of a given MS/MS consensus spectrum.", "From the selected clusters with identified compounds (Figure 5), JBIR-35 (1, m/z 467) [26], an indole-containing peptide, and tryptoquivaline K (2, m/z 457) [27], a quinazoline-containing indole alkaloid, were identified in a cluster from kanamycin-elicited samples of LAMA639 (Proteobacteria) culture. Both molecules were previously isolated from sponge-associated microorganisms. Interestingly, tryptoquivaline K (2) has a rare non-proteinogenic amino acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, uncommonly incorporated during the biosynthesis of the natural product [27]. A variety of biological results are reported in the literature for tryptoquivaline derivatives, including antifungal [28], antiviral [29] and NF-\u03baB inhibitory activities [30].", "The other two selected clusters showed the identification of LNM K-3 (3, m/z 393.1760), an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the antitumoral antibiotic leinamycin (LNM) from Streptomyces [31]; and verticilactam (4, m/z 428.2484), a macrolactam first isolated from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus JC-8444 [32]. Both compounds were detected in the EDTA elicited growth of B002_754.", "A cluster of terpenes was selected, including glycocholic acid (5, m/z 466) identified from LAMA915 (Proteobacteria) samples. It was possible to note that the elicited conditions increased the detection of 5, especially by using EDTA and procaine elicitation. Bile acids, including glycocholic acid (a glycine-conjugated cholic acid), are essentially known for being products of cholesterol degradation in liver cells and its biotransformation plays a role in the regulation of the gut microbiome [33]. In the past decades, some reports have evidenced cholic acid derivatives biosynthesis by marine bacteria (Myroides, Dokdonia, Polaribacter, Donghaeana, Maribacter, Hahella, Rhodococcus, Pseudovibrio) [34,35,36]. Most recently, 5 was found in Bacillus, presenting antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa and B. cereus (MICs from 7 to 250 \u00b5g/mL) and S. cerevisiae (MICs = 15.6 \u00b5g/mL)\u2014[37], highlighting its production by different bacterial groups, still showing antimicrobial activity towards other groups.", "2.2.4. Biological Relevance of the Library", "The chemical analyses described above highlighted the diversity and potential novelty of the bacterial metabolites produced by deep-sea bacteria, which were further induced by chemical elicitors under laboratory growth conditions. The analysis of selected clusters and identified compounds (Figure 5) point to the relevant biological activity of these known natural products. We then questioned whether the global diversity of natural compounds obtained in this work might also hold biological significance, especially in the context of drug discovery. For this, we first used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on molecular descriptors, using the 424 consensus spectra pointed as [M + H]+ ions in our dataset that were identified by the GNPS (n = 12) and UNPD (n = 412) databases. We further used 208,009 natural products available in the UNPD-ISDB and 2078 approved drugs present in the DrugBank (https://www.drugbank.ca (accessed on 25 April 2019)) [38] as references for the chemical space of natural products and drugs, respectively. The molecular descriptors of each compound were calculated using CDK\u00ae v2.0 package (https://cdk.github.io/ (accessed on 25 April 2019)) [39], including three groups: topological (n = 195), constitutional (n = 17) and geometric (n = 49). Only uncorrelated descriptors were considered to perform the analyses, resulting in the following 18 selected variables: ALogp2, C1SP2, C1SP3, C3SP2, C3SP3, LipinskiFailures, MDEC.22, MDEC.33, MDEN.12, MDEN.22, MDEN.23, MDEO.22, nAcid, nBase, nRingBlocks, nRings7, WTPT.5 and XLogP. The PCA plot resulted in a map corresponding to the chemical space covered by the identified compounds ([M + H]+ consensus spectra) from the EPfB library in comparison with the space covered by reported natural products (UNPD-ISDB) and approved drugs (DrugBank)\u2014Figure 6.", "The map is represented by four quadrants, sharing common topological and physicochemical features, and distributed according to the molecular descriptors (Q1: PC1, PC2 > 0; Q2: PC1 < 0, PC2 > 0; Q3: PC1, PC2 < 0; Q4: PC1 > 0; PC2 < 0)\u2014Figure 6b. Natural compounds from UNPD-ISDB are spread across the chemical space, being concentrated mostly at Q4 (Figure 6c). The approved drugs (DrugBank) lie mostly in the lower quadrants (Q3 and Q4) of this PCA. There is an overlap of natural products and successful drug molecules, as already pointed by Dopson [40] and, more recently, by our group using the same type of analysis [1]. Importantly, ~20% of the natural products lie in quadrant Q2, where the descriptor \u201cLipinski Failures\u201d is pointed, showing unwanted molecular features for orally administered drugs. Q2 is also represented by molecular descriptors, usually describing compounds rich in saturated carbons, such as C1SP3 and nRingBlocks (e.g., terpenes), and/or rich in oxygen and unsaturated carbons, such as MDEO.22 and C1SP2 (e.g., flavonoids and tannins). These classes of natural products are more often found in plants.", "The EPfB library is almost devoid of compounds in Q2 and rather evidences compounds at Q3 and Q4 mainly, in a distribution across the chemical space that overlaps the distribution of the approved drugs (Figure 6a,c). Q3 is represented by molecular descriptors related to nitrogen atoms (MDEN.12, MDEN.22, MDEN.23 and WTPT.5) and charged compounds (nBase and nAcid). Small peptides are expected to be found at Q3. Additionally, the EPfB library presents about 40% of compounds at Q4, where bioavailable compounds are mostly expected, indicating that a considerable number of metabolites identified in our study display the molecular features of drug-like compounds. Chemical elicitation maintained the overall distribution of the identified compounds in the EPfB library (Figure 6c\u2014\u201cexclusive\u201d bars).", "The entire EPfB chemical library was further tested in four biological assays, being three cell-based assays\u2014triple-negative breast cancer cells targeted for glutaminase inhibitors and Gram-positive/Gram-negative bacteria\u2014and one enzymatic assay\u2014proteasome inhibition (ChTL subunit). From the bioassays, 2 samples were selected and confirmed to display antibiotic activity (MIC < 16 \u00b5g/mL in Gram positive or Gram-negative bacteria; confirmed hit rate = 1%) and 2 samples were selected by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of the proteasome complex (IC50 < 40 \u00b5g/mL; confirmed hit rate = 1%). All the confirmed hits are represented by enriched fractions (Table 1).", "The identified compounds present in the bioactive samples are highlighted by a red edge in Figure 6a. Most of the metabolites detected from the bioactive samples were found at Q4, followed by Q3 and Q1 (Figure 6c, \u201call bioactive\u201d bars). Curiously, bioactive elicited fractions brought a high number of Q1 compounds (Figure 6c, \u201cbioactive elicited\u201d bars). Q1 is represented by the XlogP molecular descriptor, meaning more hydrophobic compounds. This is in accordance with the detection of antibiotic activity in the latest fractions (fractions 08 and 09) of the chromatographic series represented by LAMA639 and B002_754 samples (Table 1).", "2.2.5. Chemical Redundancy in the Relevant Biological Space", "Next, we expanded the chemical space analysis of the EPfB library by introducing unidentified analogues of known natural products present in the spectra collection. For this, non-identified [M + H]+ consensus spectra that are linked in the SSMN to one of the 424 [M + H]+ consensus spectra identified in the MS/MS spectra databases used were also considered. This was done to further include part of the chemical novelty (the 713/1137 [M + H]+ consensus spectra not identified in databases), from which we could reference chemical descriptors by linking 57/713 of them to its most similar identified [M + H]+ consensus spectra in the chemical space (for more details see the Methods section). For a better visualization of this data, the PCA plot of the EPfB library is shown in Figure 7a, being further split by sample type and growth condition Figure 7b. The presence of potential analogues of the identified compounds are denoted by the size of the circle, landmarking the chemical space with the number of similar non-identified [M + H]+ consensus spectra directly linked to the identified node in the SSMN.", "In the chemical space surrounding compound 1 (purple cross in Figure 7a at Q3) there are compounds identified from different SSMN clusters, which show spectra similarities to plant alkaloids mucronine J (7) [41], nummularine F (8) [42], tentoxin from endophytic fungi (6) [43] and cyclotetrapeptides from marine bacteria (9) [44]. Despite lying in the same chemical space, these compounds were identified from [M + H]+ consensus spectra from different SSMN clusters, showing that their spectra fragmentation is different, but their molecular features might be closely related. These cyclic peptides and alkaloids were found in all growth conditions. Cyclic peptides 6 and 9 were derived from B002_754 and B003_789 elicited by EDTA. These spectra were grouped into different clusters of the SSMN, with 6 in a cluster with 10 other nodes from the control and elicited conditions and 9 a sole spectrum in the SSMN. Compound 7 was identified from a [M + H]+ consensus spectrum only observed by B002_754 cultivation in the absence of chemical elicitors (control conditions), with one similar consensus spectrum added to this SSMN cluster in the EDTA condition. Compound 8, an analogue of 7, and similar [M + H]+ consensus spectra, were found in an independent cluster of the SSMN, being composed by nodes from LAMA585 (Firmicutes) and LAMA627 (Proteobacteria), in both control and elicited growth conditions.", "The contribution of minor metabolites to the expansion of the chemical space (fraction exclusive\u2014Figure 7b, left panels) should also be noted. Furthermore, similar compounds (non-identified, however similar to identified spectra in the SSMN) expanded the diversity around a given chemical scaffold, especially in the Q3 and Q4 regions of the chemical space (Figure 7b, represented by circles). Compound series at Q3 and Q4 seem to be upregulated by chemical elicitors, since most of the series were only detected in the elicited conditions (Figure 7b, in blue). A cluster of LAMA915 elicited by ampicillin and EDTA showed one [M + H]+ consensus spectrum with spectra similarities to compound 10, related to daphnicyclidin alkaloids isolated from the bark of Daphniphyllum macropodum [45]. This compound landmarks the chemical space of elicited minor compounds at the frontier of the Q3 and Q4 quadrants of the PCA. Ulongamide D (12) [46], a beta-aminoacid containing cyclodepsipeptides isolated from cyanobacteria, further expanded the chemical space of this set of samples to the left side of Q3, by showing spectra similarities with [M + H]+ consensus spectra found only in the elicited enriched fractions of B003_789.", "In the control condition of B003_789, a small cluster represented by hyrtiazepine (11) is found (Figure 7b, in white), an indole alkaloid first isolated from a marine sponge with enzyme inhibition properties [19,47,48]. The expression of these compounds was inhibited by EDTA elicitation. Finally, cystodytin C (13) [49], an alkaloid first isolated from tunicates, showed spectra matches with one [M + H]+ consensus spectrum present in the bioactive fractions of LAMA915. This node is linked to a non-identified spectrum, being produced in both control and elicited growth conditions.", "The production of known natural products as major compounds (found in both \u201cextract and fraction column\u201d\u2014Figure 7b, right panels) was less affected by chemical elicitation. Only four identified major compounds were found in the elicited exclusive condition. These include the biotransformation products of ampicillin mentioned before (larger circle), the major compound of the elicited exclusive SSMN cluster from which compounds 1\u20132 were derived (Figure 5), and spectra matches to plant alkaloids (Q3) and hydrophobic diterpenes (Q1)."]
