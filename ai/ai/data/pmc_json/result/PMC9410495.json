["3. Results", "3.1. Effect of MLT on Fungal Growth and HA Accumulation", "In the solid culture of Shiraia sp. S9 under light/dark (24 h:24 h) shift, dark-brown pigments were produced after 8 days (the control group in Figure 1A). MLT treatment at 0.05\u2013500.00 \u03bcM inhibited the pigment accumulation and turned the color from dark brown to pale yellow. HA contents were decreased by 17.10\u201381.29% in a dose-dependent manner under MLT treatment (Figure 1B). The conidia count showed no significant changes at low concentrations (0.05\u20130.50 \u03bcM) of MLT but decreased significantly at high concentrations (50.00\u2013500.00 \u03bcM) (Figure 1C). The germination rate of spores decreased by 3.20\u201376.93% during the MLT treatment at 100.00 \u03bcM after 8\u201312 h (Figure 1D).", "In the liquid cultures, the morphology of the fungal pellets was observed after MLT treatment at 100.00 \u03bcM. The bigger and fluffier pale pellets were formed after MLT treatment (Figure 2A). The diameter of fungal pellets was increased by 10.91\u201318.23% from day 5 to day 8 (Figure 2B). To investigate MLT\u2019s effect on HA production in the mycelium culture, MLT (0.05\u2013500.00 \u03bcM) was added on day 2 of the culture (Figure 2C,D). Although the fungal biomass was not altered by MLT, HA contents in fungal mycelia were suppressed significantly with the increasing concentration of MLT. The lowest content (1.32 mg/g DW) wa reached under MLT at 500.00 \u03bcM, about 11.40% of the control (Figure 2D). These results demonstrated that MLT inhibited HA biosynthesis of Shiraia sp. S9 in either solid or liquid cultures.", "3.2. Effects of MLT on ROS Generation and the Activities of Antioxidant Enzymes", "To examine ROS accumulation in the mycelia of Shiraia sp. S9, a fluorescent probe DCFH-DA was used. We observed a green fluorescence in mycelia in the culture under the exposure for 24\u201372 h of light/dark shift (24 h:24 h) (the control group in Figure 3A), and the green fluorescence was attenuated after the addition of MLT at 100 \u03bcM (MLT group in Figure 3A). The fluorescence intensity decreased by 39.49\u201375.33% after 24\u201372 h of MLT treatment compared with the control (Figure 3B). After 48 h of MLT treatment, the contents of O2\u2212 and H2O2 in mycelia were found to be decreased by 45.63% and 17.97%, respectively (Figure 3C,D). When the culture was added with exogenous H2O2 (100 \u03bcM) with MLT, the suppressed H2O2 contents in mycelia were rescued (Figure 3E). These results indicated that MLT treatment could inhibit ROS production in Shiraia sp. S9 under light exposure.", "In addition, the activities of NOX, SOD, CAT, and POD were also determined under MLT treatment. Although NOX activity was not altered (Figure 4A), the activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD and POD) were increased significantly during the culture (Figure 4B\u2013D). The activity of CAT was enhanced immediately after MLT addition on day 2 to 24.54 U/mg protein on day 3, about 1.38-fold over the control (Figure 4B). The SOD activity showed an increasing tendency with the cultivation time (Figure 4C). After MLT addition on day 2, POD activity increased to a broad peak on day 3 (0.13 U/mg protein) and to a higher peak on day 6 (0.20 U/mg protein) (Figure 4D).", "3.3. Effect of MLT on NO Generation", "We detected NO generation in Shiraia sp. S9 by the fluorescent probe DAF-2 DA. Shiraia hyphae displayed an obvious green fluorescence enhancement in response to MLT treatment at 100 \u03bcM (Figure 5A). After 8 and 24 h of MLT treatment, the relative intensity of DAF-2 DA fluorescence increased by 3.72- and 1.70-fold over the control, respectively (Figure 5B). A significant increase in the NO contents in mycelia was observed on days 4\u20138, whereas the peak value (8.61 \u03bcmol/g fresh weight, FW) was reached on day 5, about 3.27-fold higher than the control (Figure 5C). However, MLT-induced NO production was suppressed by 19.04%, 68.51% and 57.52% by NOS inhibitor L-NAME, NR inhibitor STD and NO scavenger cPTIO, respectively (L-NAME, STD or cPTIO + MLT vs. MLT in Figure 5D). These results suggested that MLT treatment could induce NO production in Shiraia sp. S9. To further investigate the interrelation between NO and ROS during MLT treatment, NO donor SNP (10 \u03bcM) and scavenger cPTIO (100 \u03bcM), and exogenous H2O2 (100 \u03bcM) and Vc (100 \u03bcM) were added, respectively, to the culture under MLT treatment. Although the addition of H2O2 did not cause significant changes in NO production induced by MLT (MLT vs. MLT + H2O2 in Figure 6A), Vc increased NO production by 67.26% (MLT vs. MLT + Vc in Figure 6A). Contrarily, pretreatment with NO donor SNP could reduce O2\u2212 contents by 61.2% (MLT vs. MLT + SNP in Figure 6B), but cPTIO increased O2\u2212 contents by 45.2% (MLT vs. MLT + cPTIO in Figure 6B). The results indicated ROS and NO could act antagonistically during the MLT treatment in the mycelium culture under a light/dark shift (24 h:24 h).", "3.4. Effect of MLT on HA Contents and Gene Expression for HA Biosynthesis", "Exogenous MLT significantly reduced HA contents in mycelium culture under a light/dark shift (24 h:24 h) (MLT vs. control in Figure 7A). However, the exogenous applied H2O2 or NO scavenger cPTIO caused enhancement of HA contents during the MLT treatment (MLT vs. MLT + H2O2 or MLT + cPTIO in Figure 7B). HA contents were suppressed further by Vc or NO donor SNP (MLT vs. MLT + Vc or MLT + SNP in Figure 7B). The expression levels of seven key HA biosynthesis genes, including polyketide synthase (PKS), FAD/FMN-containing dehydrogenase (FAD), multicopper oxidase (MCO), major facilitator superfamily (MFS), O-methyl-transferase (Omef), zinc finger transcription factor (ZFTF) and monooxygenase (Mono) were quantitatively detected by qRT-PCR. They were significantly down-regulated by MLT treatment, about 2.57-, 1.93-, 3.74-, 1.97-, 3.57-, 9.73- and 5.30-fold of the control group, respectively (Figure 7B). After being pre-treated with cPTIO and H2O2 for 30 min prior to MLT treatment, the expression levels of some genes (MCO, Mono, ZFTF and Omef) were partially rescued. These results indicated the mediation of ROS and NO in the regulation of MLT on Shiraia HA biosynthesis."]
