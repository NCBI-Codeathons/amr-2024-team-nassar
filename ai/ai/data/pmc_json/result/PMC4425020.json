Screening of the Growth Medium for Electro-Competent Cells", "An appropriate growth medium is an important factor for determining the electroporation efficiency of bacteria [11,28,29]. In the selected optimal growth medium, four types of growth medium (LBS, LBSP, NCM and BHIS) were investigated to prepare the electro-competent cells of B. subtilis ZK. These mediums have been used as the growth mediums for preparing electro-competent in Gram-positive strains [9,11,28]. The first three mediums are suitable for preparing electro-competent cells of B. amyloliquefaciens. Nutrient BHIS medium is regarded as the proper medium for the Gram-positve Corynebacterium glutamicum [28]. Table 1 shows that the LBSP medium yielded a higher efficiency (1.3 \u00d7 104 transformants/\u03bcg of DNA) than the LBS, NCM, and BHIS media. Consequently, the LBSP medium was proved to be the appropriate medium for B. subtilis ZK and used to prepare the electro-competent cells in the subsequent experiments.", "Effect of growth media on the electroporation efficiency of B. subtilis ZK.", "Media EE a Reference.", "LBS 4 \u00d7 103 \u00b1 0.62 \u00d7 103 [9].", "LBSP 1.3 \u00d7 104 \u00b1 0.17 \u00d7 104 [29].", "NCM 7 \u00d7 102 \u00b1 0.39 \u00d7 102 [30].", "BHIS 1.6 \u00d7 102 \u00b1 0.82 \u00d7 102 [31].", "When the OD600 value reached 0.65, the electro-transformed competent cells were prepared.

However, the opposite result was found in the B. subtilis ZK and we found some lysis of B. subtilis ZK in the NCM medium, which indicated that the ion concentration in NCM may be too high for B. subtilis ZK.", "2.2. Effect of Growth Phase on the Electroporation Efficiency", "Growth phase markedly affects the electroporation efficiency [15,32]. To investigate the effect of growth phase on the electroporation efficiency, electro-competent cells were prepared at different OD600 values (0.3\u20131.3). Figure 1 presents the relationship between the electroporation efficiency and the growth phase. The results show that proper growth phase (OD600 0.7\u20131) yielded higher electroporation efficiency and an efficiency of 4 \u00d7 104 transformants/\u03bcg of DNA was obtained when the OD600 value reached 0.85. In contrast with results of B. cereus [15] and B. thuringiensis [32], where the early phase of exponential growth (OD600 0.1\u20130.4) yielded the highest electroporation efficiency, our results indicated that the late phase of exponential growth (OD600 0.7\u20131) yielded the highest electroporation efficiency in B. subtilis ZK. Similar results have been observed in B. subtilis IH6140 and B. amyloliqueficence [9], as well as C. pseudotuberculosis [22] in which the late phase of exponential growth was required to obtain the highest electroporation efficiency.", "Figure 1Effects of growth phase of B. subtilis ZK on the electroporation efficiency.

Effect of Electric Field on the Electroporation Efficiency", "Applying high electric field is an approach to overcome the wall of B. subtilis, which improves the permeabilization of membrane and produces Bacillus cells accessible by exogenous plasmid [11]. However, an exorbitant electric field results in death of cells. To optimize the electric field for B. subtilis ZK, electroporation experiments were performed under a gradient of field strength (8\u201326 kV\u00b7cm\u22121). The relationship between the field strength and the electroporation efficiency is shown in Figure 2. An electric field of 20 kV\u00b7cm\u22121 led to the optimal efficiency (4 \u00d7 104 transformants/\u03bcg of DNA), and this value was thus used in the follow-up experiments. The electric fields at around 5\u201310 kV\u00b7cm\u22121 are appropriate conditions for most bacterial cells and can produce the pores accessible by plasmid [10]. In the present study, we found that a high electric field (20 kV\u00b7cm\u22121) yielded the highest electroporation efficiency in B. subtilis ZK. Similarly high electric field (18\u201320 kV\u00b7cm\u22121) has been observed in B. amyloliqueficence [11], B. cereus [15], B. licheniformis [9], and B. thuringiensis [14]. These results indicated that the high electric field was required to achieve the high electroporation efficiency in Bacillus strains.", "Figure 2Effects of the field strength on the electroporation efficiency of B. subtilis ZK.

Investigation the Concentration of Wall-Weakening Agent for RSM Design", "Application of weakening agents is an important means to improve the electroporation efficiency in Bacillus. Glycine, dl-threonine, Tween 80, and ampicillin are widely used to increase the electroporation efficiency in Bacillus strains. Glycine and dl-threonine can be integrated into the walls of cells and replace the alanine, deducing the peptidoglycan linkage and loosening the walls of cells [33]. The Tween 80 can increase the electroporation efficiency, likely because the Tween 80 loosens the cell walls and disturbs the cell\u2013membrane fluidity [11].", "To investigate the concentration of wall-weakening agent for RSM design, the four types of wall-weakening agents (glycine, dl-threonine, Tween 80, and ampicillin) were individually used to prepare the electro-competent cells. The results, which are exhibited in Figure 3, show the individual effect of the weakening agent on the electroporation efficiency. The four types of weakening agents all exhibited an enhancing effect on the electroporation efficiency. Specifically, 0.75% glycine, 1% dl-threonine, and 0.07% Tween 80 yielded efficiencies of 2.75 \u00d7 105, 4.5 \u00d7 105 and 3.4 \u00d7 105 transformants/\u00b5g of DNA, respectively (Figure 3A\u2013C). In addition, 10 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin showed best effect on the electroporation efficiency and improved the efficiency to 5 \u00d7 105 transformants/\u00b5g of DNA, which is a 12.5-fold increase compared with the LBSP medium alone (Figure 3D). All these weakening agents yielded significant increases in electroporation efficiency (one order of magnitude) and the order in which the weakening agents contributed to electroporation efficiency was ampicillin > dl-threonine > Tween 80 > glycine. In contrast with the result of B. cereus [15], where the weakening agents (glycine, dl-threonine) had a negative effect on the electroporation efficiency, our results indicated that the wall-weakening agents played a crucial role in improving electroporation efficiency for B. subtilis ZK. A similar positive effect has been found in B. amyloliquefaciens [11], Gordonia [34], B. thuringiensis [14], and C. pseudotuberculosis [22], in which a certain ratio of weakening agents was required to obtain high electroporation efficiency.", "Figure 3Effects of wall-weakening agents on the electroporation efficiency of B. subtilis ZK.

The observed electroporation efficiency was regressed to obtain a mathematical model shown in Equation (1).
