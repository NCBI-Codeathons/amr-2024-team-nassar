["RESULTS", "Identification of zeamine resistance genes in D. oryzae", "To identify zeamine resistance genes in D. oryzae EC1, its zeamine\u2010minus mutant \u2206zmsA was mutated with the mariner\u2010based transposon carried by pBT20 (Seet & Zhang,\u00a02011). Mutant \u2206zmsA was chosen for transposon mutagenesis to eliminate a putative toxic effect of the self\u2010produced zeamines on the growth of transposon insertional mutants that are sensitive to zeamines. The resultant library was screened for mutants with altered sensitivity to zeamines. After screening about 11,800 transposon insertional mutants, nine mutants designated as Zs1\u2013Zs9 showing higher levels of zeamine sensitivity than the parental strain \u2206zmsA were obtained. The flanking regions adjacent to the insertion sites were amplified by fusion primer and nested integrated PCR (FPNI\u2010PCR; Wang et al.,\u00a02011) and sequenced for BLASTn analysis to localize the insertion sites. The results showed that the mutants Zs1\u2013Zs9 harbour transposon insertions within a putative seven\u2010gene operon (Figure\u00a01a, Table\u00a0S1), which shows over 88% similarity at the nucleotide level to the previously characterized arn operon of D. dadantii 3937 (Costechareyre et al.,\u00a02013). This putative operon was hence named the arn\nEC1 operon (Figure\u00a01a) and selected for subsequent analysis. Two Zs mutants, Zs4 and Zs7, with transposon insertions in the arnA\nEC1 and arnT\nEC1 genes, respectively, were randomly selected for the MIC assay. The results showed that they were 8\u2010fold more sensitive to zeamines than their parental strain \u2206zmsA. In trans expression of arnT\nEC1 in the mutant Zs7 fully restored its zeamine resistance to the level of strain \u2206zmsA (Table\u00a01), suggesting that the arn\nEC1 genes are involved in D. oryzae resistance to zeamines.", "FIGURE 1Genetic organization and characterization of the arn\nEC1 operon.

W909_RS19690) and arnC\nEC1 (NCBI accession no. W909_RS19695) encode a putative UDP\u20104\u2010amino\u20104\u2010deoxy\u2010l\u2010arabinose\u2010oxoglutarate aminotransferase and a putative undecaprenyl phosphate\u20104\u2010deoxy\u20104\u2010formamido\u2010l\u2010arabinose transferase, respectively. ArnA\nEC1 (NCBI accession no. W909_RS19700) encodes a putative decarboxylase/UDP\u20104\u2010amino\u20104\u2010deoxy\u2010l\u2010arabinose formyltransferase, and arnD\nEC1 (NCBI accession no.

The last two genes, arnE\nEC1 (NCBI accession no. W909_RS19715) and arnF\nEC1 (NCBI accession no. W909_RS19720), encode two putative l\u2010Ara4N\u2010phosphoundecaprenol flippase subunits. The proteins encoded by the arn\nEC1 genes have high levels of similarity (above 57%) with their counterparts in S. enterica (McClelland et al.,\u00a02001), P. aeruginosa (McPhee et al.,\u00a02003), and D. dadantii (Costechareyre et al.,\u00a02013) (Table\u00a0S3). In addition, the arn\nEC1 operon also shares a conserved genetic organization with the arn operon (the pmr operon) in S. enterica (Figure\u00a01a) (Gunn et al.,\u00a02000). Reverse transcription\u2010PCR (RT\u2010PCR) results indicated that these seven genes were cotranscribed in a way similar to their homologues in S. enterica (Figure\u00a01b) (Gunn et al.,\u00a02000). In S. enterica, the arn operon confers bacterial resistance to polymyxin B, which also acts by damaging the bacterial cell envelope, similar to zeamines (Masschelein, Clauwers, Stalmans, et al.,\u00a02015). To further elucidate the roles of the arn\nEC1 operon, in\u2010frame deletion mutants of arnBCADT\nEC1 were generated in the background of the mutant \u2206zmsA. MIC assay results showed that inactivation of these arn\nEC1 operon genes resulted in an over 8\u2010fold decrease in the MIC of zeamines and an over 300\u2010fold decrease in the MIC of polymyxin B (Table\u00a01). Conversely, in trans expression of the corresponding arn\nEC1 genes, except for arnE\nEC1 and arnF\nEC1, in the mutants could fully restore the MICs of zeamines and polymyxin B (Table\u00a01). These findings established the key roles of the arn\nEC1 operon in conferring zeamine and polymyxin B resistance in D. oryzae.", "To further validate the role of the arn\nEC1 operon in LPS modification and thus resistance to CAMPs, the arn\nEC1 operon from D. oryzae EC1 was cloned and introduced into D. dadantii 3937, a zeamine\u2010 and polymyxin B\u2010sensitive strain (Table\u00a01), together with the ugd\nEC1 gene (NCBI accession no. W909_RS06165), whose homologue in E. coli was found to be epistatic to the arn operon for lipid A modification (Yan et al.,\u00a02007). MIC assay results indicated that heterologous expression of the arn\nEC1 operon and the ugd\nEC1 gene in D. dadantii 3937 could increase bacterial resistance to zeamines and particularly polymyxin B (Table\u00a01). These findings suggest that the arn\nEC1 operon from D. oryzae EC1 could effectively modify and reinforce the cell envelope of D. dadantii 3937, conferring strong resistance to the CAMP polymyxin B as well as zeamines.", "Our previous study unveiled that the RND efflux pump DesABC plays a key role in zeamine resistance in D. oryzae EC1. Inactivation of desB resulted in an about eightfold decrease in the MIC of zeamines (Liang et al.,\u00a02019). Similarly, inactivation of arnB\nEC1 in the zmsA mutant background resulted in a 16\u2010fold decrease in the MIC of zeamines (Table\u00a01). To test the synergistic effect of the DesABC efflux pump and the Arn LPS modification system, we generated a triple deletion mutant, \u2206zmsA\u2206arnB\nEC1\u2206desB, which showed a 128\u2010fold decrease in the MIC of zeamines compared to the parental strain \u2206zmsA (Table\u00a01). Significantly, double deletion of arnB\nEC1/desB brought down the MIC to the level of the zeamine\u2010sensitive E. coli DH5\u03b1 (Table\u00a01), suggesting that the DesABC efflux pump and the Arn LPS modification system are dominant self\u2010protection mechanisms of D. oryzae against its self\u2010produced zeamines.", "Expression of the arn\nEC1 operon is growth\u2010dependent but zeamine\u2010independent", "Our previous work indicated that expression of desAB is stimulated by zeamines (Liang et al.,\u00a02019). To test whether expression of the arn\nEC1 operon is also zeamine\u2010dependent, the promoter region of the arn\nEC1 operon was fused with the gfp\u2010coding region in plasmid pPROBE\u2010NT (Miller et al.,\u00a02000) to generate the reporter construct pArnEC1gfp. The relative fluorescence of the wild\u2010type strain EC1 and the zeamine\u2010minus mutant \u2206zmsA harbouring the pArnEC1gfp construct, that is, EC1(pArnEC1gfp) and \u2206zmsA(pArnEC1gfp), was determined in LS5 medium, which was optimized for zeamine production (Liao et al.,\u00a02014). The results showed that the relative fluorescence of EC1(pArnEC1gfp) increased along with the growth of D. oryzae EC1 (Figure\u00a02a,b), suggesting that expression of the arn\nEC1 operon is growth\u2010dependent. In addition, the relative fluorescence of EC1(pArnEC1gfp) and \u2206zmsA(pArnEC1gfp) was comparable at different bacterial growth stages (Figure\u00a02c), suggesting that unlike desAB, whose expression could be triggered by zeamines (Liang et al.,\u00a02019), expression of the arn\nEC1 operon is independent of the exposure of zeamines. Moreover, the relative fluorescence of EC1(pArnEC1gfp) was higher than the relative fluorescence of EC1(pDesABgfp), a desAB reporter strain for determining desAB expression in the wild\u2010type strain EC1 (Liang et al.,\u00a02019), at different bacterial growth stages, especially at the early one when zeamines were not highly accumulated (Figure\u00a02a,d), suggesting that the arn\nEC1 genes had higher expression levels than desAB even when D. oryzae produced a small amount of zeamines. These findings suggest that the ArnEC1 LPS modification system is a zeamine\u2010independent resistance mechanism crucial to the self\u2010resistance of D. oryzae.", "FIGURE 2Expression pattern of the arn\nEC1 operon.

Following this thought, the virulence of arn\nEC1 in in\u2010frame deletion mutants was assayed against rice seeds, Chinese cabbage, and potato tubers. The results showed that compared to the wild\u2010type strain EC1, the virulence of the five single mutants with one of the arnBCADT\nEC1 genes deleted was attenuated in inhibition of rice seed germination when challenged with 108\u2010fold dilutions of cell resuspensions (Figure\u00a03a). Similarly, these mutants were also less virulent on Chinese cabbage (Figure\u00a03b). Intriguingly, however, we found that compared to the single mutants in the arnCAT\nEC1 genes, mutants \u2206arnB\nEC1 and \u2206arnD\nEC1 were much less virulent against rice seeds, Chinese cabbage, and potato tubers (Figures\u00a03 and S1). In particular, deletion of arnB\nEC1 eliminated the most virulence of strain EC1 compared to the arnCADT\nEC1 single mutants in Chinese cabbage (Figure\u00a03b). In trans expression of the corresponding arn\nEC1 genes in the mutants could restore bacterial virulence (Figure\u00a03). Given these findings, we reasoned that in addition to the role of the arn\nEC1 operon in the bacterial LPS modification and hence the contribution to the in planta survival and virulence of D. oryzae EC1, arnB\nEC1 and arnD\nEC1 might play additional roles in modulation of D. oryzae physiology and virulence.", "FIGURE 3Virulence assay of Dickeya oryzae EC1 and derivatives on rice seeds, Chinese cabbage, and potato tubers.

In contrast, deletion of arnD\nEC1 did not seem to affect bacterial morphology (Figures\u00a04a and S2). A bacterial mucoid phenotype is often associated with the overproduction of capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) and biofilm formation in bacteria (Mann & Wozniak,\u00a02012).

The results showed that inactivation of arnB\nEC1 led to significant changes in gene expression, with 291 genes being up\u2010regulated and 367 genes being down\u2010regulated (absolute log2[fold change] \u22651, Tables\u00a0S4 and S5). In particular, a range of genes associated with phenotypic conversion between nonmucoid and mucoid, cell division, and swimming motility were found in the ArnBEC1 regulon.", "We firstly conducted detailed bioinformatics analyses on the 291 genes that were significantly up\u2010regulated in mutant \u2206arnB\nEC1 (Table\u00a0S4). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the O\u2010antigen nucleotide sugar biosynthesis pathway was significantly up\u2010regulated in mutant \u2206arnB\nEC1 (p\nadj\u2009\u2264\u20090.05), including the genes located in two eps (exopolysaccharide polysaccharide) clusters (Figure\u00a07a, Table\u00a0S4). One eps cluster (NCBI accession nos. W909_RS06075 to W909_RS06155) contains the homologues of the wzabc genes. In E. coli, the wzabc genes encode proteins involved in group I CPS transport (Dong et al.,\u00a02006). The other eps cluster contains the homologues of yjbEFGH. In E. coli, the yjbEFGH genes are responsible for the production of an unknown exopolysaccharide (Ferrieres et al.,\u00a02007). Our transcriptomics analysis results showed that the genes in these two eps clusters were up\u2010regulated at least 4\u2010fold in mutant \u2206arnB\nEC1 (log2[fold change]\u2009\u2265\u20092, Table\u00a0S4).", "FIGURE 7Transcriptomics analysis revealed the genes regulated by ArnEC1.

To address whether the mucoid phenotype of arnBCAT\nEC1 mutants is associated with the up\u2010regulation of the CPS genes found in the transcriptomics analysis, cps1 expression in mutants \u2206arnB\nEC1, \u2206arnC\nEC1, \u2206arnA\nEC1, and \u2206arnT\nEC1 was compared to that in the wild\u2010type strain EC1 by reverse transcription\u2010quantitative PCR (RT\u2010qPCR) analysis. The results showed that compared to the wild\u2010type strain EC1, cps1 expression was increased 15\u2010 to 48\u2010fold in these four mutants (Figure\u00a07b). In\u2010frame deletion of cps1 in the backgrounds of single mutants in the arnBCA\nEC1 genes led to conversion from a mucoid to a nonmucoid phenotype (Figures\u00a04a and S2). These findings indicate that ArnEC1 proteins maintain the nonmucoid morphotype of D. oryzae EC1 through repression of CPS production.", "We then analysed the 367 genes down\u2010regulated in the mutant \u2206arnB\nEC1 (Table\u00a0S5). KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the ribosome pathway was significantly affected in mutant \u2206arnB\nEC1 (p\nadj\u2009\u2264\u20090.05, Table\u00a0S5). In particular, the genes in the S10 ribosomal protein gene cluster (NCBI accession nos. W909_RS17515 to W909_RS17645) were significantly down\u2010regulated (Figure\u00a07c, Table\u00a0S5). Previous studies with E. coli and Bacillus subtilis unveiled that the genes in the S10 ribosomal protein gene cluster, that is, L2, L3, L17, and S11, are essential for bacterial growth, cell division, and swimming motility (Klitgaard et al.,\u00a02015; Suzuki et al.,\u00a02014; Takada et al.,\u00a02014; Zouine et al.,\u00a02000), which are the phenotypes modulated by ArnBEC1 in D. oryzae EC1. Consistent with the transcriptomics analysis results, RT\u2010qPCR analysis results confirmed that the transcript levels of L2, L3, L4, L17, S10, and S11 in the S10 ribosomal protein gene cluster were significantly decreased in mutant \u2206arnB\nEC1 compared to the wild\u2010type strain EC1 and mutant \u2206arnD\nEC1 (Figure\u00a07d), an arn\nEC1 mutant with defects in bacterial growth and swimming motility as mutant \u2206arnB\nEC1 (Figure\u00a05). In E. coli, RNA biosynthesis is closely linked to the production of ribosomal proteins (Zengel & Lindahl,\u00a01994). We demonstrated that although RNA integrity in mutant \u2206arnB\nEC1 was comparable to that in the wild\u2010type strain EC1 and mutant \u2206arnD\nEC1 (Figure\u00a07e), mutant \u2206arnB\nEC1 had a lower amount of RNA than the wild\u2010type strain EC1 and mutant \u2206arnD\nEC1 (Figure\u00a07e). These findings seem to suggest that ArnBEC1 affects bacterial growth, cell division, and swimming motility through regulating a specific pathway to maintain homeostasis of RNA biosynthesis and expression of S10 ribosomal genes in D. oryzae."]
