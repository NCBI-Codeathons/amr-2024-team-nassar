["Results", "Isolation and molecular analysis of claR gene", "Total DNA was isolated from Streptomyces and\nsubjected to gel electrophoresis to analyze the concentration\nand purity. The pure, isolated total DNA\nwas used for PCR reactions. Two different sets of\nprimers were used. The claR gene was successfully\namplified by using the claR2 primer set(Fig 2).", "The isolated fragment had to be studied in more\ndetail to further compare it with the original claR\nof S. clavuligerus DSM738. Two different strategies\nwere conducted to not only confirm the amplified\nfragment as claR gene, but to also compare it\nwith the claR gene sequence from S. clavuligerus\nDSM738. Initially nested PCR, using the claR1\nprimer set, confirmed the existence of claR gene\n(data not shown).", "Fig 2Amplification of claR with its native promoterfrom\nS. clavuligerus PTCC 1705 by PCR.

This conclusion\nwas achieved because the claR sequence of S. clavuligerus\nDSM738 had been used to design the primers.\nRFLP- PCR was then carried out using the SalI\nrestriction enzyme. SalI cuts the claR gene at 740 and\n1331 bp, producing three fragments, 740, 591 and\n338 bp.
