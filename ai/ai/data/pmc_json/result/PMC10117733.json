["Results", "DNA extraction yield and quality", "Large variations were observed in the DNA contents of the different soil samples despite their similar macroscopic appearances (black/brownish fine silt and sandy compact soils), including between surface samples (taken from vegetation-free spots). Using the same extraction protocol, up to 75 times more DNA could be recovered from similarly dated ancient soils from different sites (Table S1, Supporting Information, for instance sample B vs P). A lesser range of variation (10 times) was observed between surface samples (samples C and D) already suggesting that the sample age was not the main cause of these differences. Interestingly, very similar total numbers of usable base pairs and good quality reads were determined from the 250\u00a0ng of purified DNA used for sequencing) (Table S1, Supporting Information). Except for sample B (sequenced as shorter reads on a different platform), we observed no correlation between the initial DNA content of the sample and the number of usable good quality reads (Table S1, Supporting Information), indicating that, once purified, all DNAs exhibited a similar quality.", "Sample diversity", "In contrast, the assembly of a similar number of sequenced reads from the different datasets resulted in a highly variable number of contigs (\u22655\u00a0kb). As these values are linked to the complexity of the sample (species richness, number of different species; and their relative abundance, species evenness), this suggested that the samples exhibit globally different microbial population compositions and structures. As our samples are expected to be variable in richness and evenness while the number of reads is quite similar (except for sample B), the sequencing effort is expected to be different for each sample. This was confirmed by the Nonpareil tool that calculates the sequencing effort and an alternative to the Shannon diversity index computed from the k-mer diversity of reads (Rodriguez-R et\u00a0al. 2018). Prior to any taxonomical annotation we could thus estimate the sample diversity as well as the estimated sample coverage (i.e. the proportion of the sample diversity actually sequenced) that ranges from 0.39 (sample E) to 0.9 (sample L) (Fig. S2, Supporting Information). Given the same number of reads for two samples, a larger coverage corresponds to a lesser diversity. According to Fig.\u00a01, the richest is sample E and the poorest is sample L. There are large differences between samples, including among the Kamchatka surface samples that appear the most diverse. The Nonpareil diversity values do not significantly correlate with the amounts of DNA recovered from one gram of soil (Table S1, Supporting Information). In contrast and as expected, the diversity values negatively correlate with the median coverage of the contigs in each sample (Pearson correlation of \u22120.75, P< 0.005).", "Figure 1.Nonpareil diversity compared with sample depth. Nonpareil diversity was computed on reads over 35\u00a0bp in size. This metric is correlated to the Shannon index (Rodriguez-R et\u00a0al. 2018).", "Nonpareil diversity compared with sample depth. Nonpareil diversity was computed on reads over 35\u00a0bp in size. This metric is correlated to the Shannon index (Rodriguez-R et\u00a0al. 2018).", "When focusing on a given borehole, we found that the diversity appeared to increase with sample depth in a given borehole (Fig.\u00a01). However, diversity values were quite variable for samples taken at similar depths across different boreholes, in line with the lack of a consistent relationship between the diversity and the age (from radiocarbon dating) of the sample (Table\u00a01A).", "Global species content", "As depicted in Fig. S3A (Supporting Information), bacteria account for over 90% of the estimated abundance in most samples and 87% in average but they represent 95% of contigs (>5 kb).\u00a0This\u00a0is true for all modern cryosols and most ancient permafrost layers despite their different origins and DNA contents. Even higher proportions of bacterial sequences were computed by Kraken2 (Wood et al. 2019) (Fig. S3B, Supporting Information). However, we found this method to be less sensitive and was not used further in this study. Four samples, L, N, R and Q, appear to be poorer in bacterial sequences (\u226477%) due to their higher proportions of unclassified and Archaea sequences (Fig. S3A, Supporting Information).", "In all samples combined, Archaea represent 3.2% of the abundance but only 1.8% of the total contig number. In most samples, they are very rare except in sample Q (unfrozen talik) and three samples from different depths in the same borehole (L, R, N: respectively, 12, 16 and 19\u00a0m) where they represent 6.5\u201311.3% of the total abundance (Fig. S3A, Supporting Information). In the samples where they are in sizable amounts, the archaeal population is dominated by Bathyarchaeota (a recently described clade of methanogens belonging to the TACK phylum) (Evans et\u00a0al. 2015), Nitrososphaeria (a class of chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizing Archaea belonging to the Thaumarchaea and globally distributed in soils) (Hatzenpichler 2012) and Methanomicrobia (a class of methanogens belonging to the Euryarchaeota and previously noticed to be enriched in the sediment microbiomes associated with the rhizosphere of macrophytes) (Behera et\u00a0al. 2020) (Fig. S4, Supporting Information).", "Eukaryotic DNA represents <1% of contigs and 0.5% of the total abundance, except for two subsurface samples from the same borehole (R, N) with 1% and 2% of eukaryotes respectively (Fig. S3, Supporting Information). The Viridiplantae (land plants and green algae) and Unikont (mostly Fungi, Metazoan and Amoebozoa) constitute most of the represented clades except for samples E and O (Fig. S5, Supporting Information). The latter only exhibits 68 total eukaryotic contigs, 21 of which were attributed to the Bacillariophyceae (the class of diatoms). With 30 other contigs most likely originating from green algae, this suggests that this 40\u2009000-year-old layer originated from a lake bottom deposit (Table\u00a01A) (Fig. S5, Supporting Information).", "Finally, according to the LCA assignment method, viruses were predicted to only represent 0.4% of the global coverage of all samples (Fig. S3, Supporting Information), with one sample (R) standing out by reaching 2.3%. Such low representation prompted us to reanalyze our datasets using VirSorter, a leading software tool specifically dedicated to the identification of viruses in metagenomics data (Roux et\u00a0al. 2015). This new protocol increased the average abundance of virus to 2.68%, with only a handful of samples exhibiting values higher than 2%, including the R sample at 8.6% (Fig. S6, Supporting Information). The newly annotated viral (mostly phage) contigs originated from contigs attributed to Bacteria by the LCA method (Fig. S6B, Supporting Information). The family distributions between theses samples is quite variable but, in general, the most abundant viruses are Mimiviridae, Pithoviridae (the prototype of which was previously isolated from ancient permafrost; Legendre et\u00a0al. 2014), Caudovirales, Phycodnaviridae and Ascoviridae, all families known to gather giant or large DNA viruses. A detailed analysis of these virus populations will be published elsewhere.", "A high diversity that points out syngenetically trapped communities", "The global community analysis and an analysis of the k-mer frequencies of reads in each dataset do not consistently put samples from the same borehole close to each other (L-N-R, P-K, Q-M-O) (Fig. S7, Supporting Information). These analyses do not allow a meaningful clustering of samples originating from the different boreholes, or even distinguish surface samples from permafrost samples (Fig. S7, Supporting Information).", "Focus on the bacterial populations", "The relative abundances of phyla representing >0.5% of the total sum of coverages are depicted in Fig.\u00a02. Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are the two most abundant phyla. Although Proteobacteria appear globally dominant (40% of the estimated abundance and over 75% in sample E), it is not always the most abundant in every sample. The most extreme cases include sample P in which Actinobacteria are largely dominant, and sample Q in which Bacteroidetes is the leading phylum. The relative abundance of Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria and Verrumicrobia varies strongly across samples from up to 28%, 14%, 13% and 7.8%, respectively, almost down to zero. None of these characteristics appears to correlate with the geographic location, depth or age of the samples.", "Figure 2.Bacterial phyla abundances across samples. The abundance is estimated as the fraction of the total sum of coverages.", "Bacterial phyla abundances across samples. The abundance is estimated as the fraction of the total sum of coverages.", "Within a given phylum, such as the Proteobacteria (Fig. S8, Supporting Information), very distinct distributions across classes could be seen between different modern cryosols (C, D, E) or ancient permafrost layers either from the same borehole (L-R-N, Q-M-O) or from similar depth (16 m: M and N; 19 m: R and O). Species from the Alpha, Beta and Delta/Epsilon divisions constitute the bulk of the Proteobacteria populations, although with strong variations. For instance, Betaproteobacteria are quasi absent from the R and N samples, as are Alphaproteobacteria from sample E.", "At lower taxonomical ranks the distributions become scattered, as well as less informative given the smaller proportion of nonambiguously annotated contigs (66.3% at the phylum level, 43.6% at the order level, but only 16.4% at the genus level). The most abundant order overall is Rhizobiales that is present in all samples (Fig.\u00a03). Unclassified Actinobacteria are the second most abundant group suggesting that the cryosol Actinobacteria are very different from their cultured relatives. In samples taken individually, Rhizobiales is the most abundant order in samples N and R where they represent 53% and 23% of the bacterial abundance, respectively. Burkholderiales are the most abundant order in samples E, D and O and Clostridiales are the most represented in samples Q and O. In the other samples, unclassified Actinobacteria represent the major group. In some samples (C, D, E, B, L, O), the high abundance of Proteobacteria is divided between multiples orders in the phylum rather than due to a predominant one. In samples R, N, P, K, M on the other hand, Proteobacteria are mostly represented by Rhizobiales (Fig.\u00a03). Some of the orders found also in deep samples are known to be aerobic. This is the case for Vicinamibacteraceae (Huber and Overmann 2018) and Gaiellales (Albuquerque and da Costa 2014) but these together constitute only 2.4% of the bacterial abundance. Most groups present in these cryosols are thus facultative anaerobes and chemotrophs.", "Figure 3.Bacterial abundance across samples. Samples and most abundant bacterial orders (over 0.5% of the total normalized coverage) were clustered using the Bray\u2013Curtis distance. The abundance is estimated by the sum of coverages (normalized to 1 in each sample).", "Bacterial abundance across samples. Samples and most abundant bacterial orders (over 0.5% of the total normalized coverage) were clustered using the Bray\u2013Curtis distance. The abundance is estimated by the sum of coverages (normalized to 1 in each sample).", "The analysis suggests a lot of variability across samples, making it illusory to expect that a tractable number of bacterial orders could be used to classify the various types of cryosol and permafrost into recurrent taxonomical types. While surface samples and most deep samples form separate clusters (Fig.\u00a03), we should be careful in drawing conclusions as the surface samples come from separate locations. When samples from the same borehole do cluster together (L-N-R and P-K), their dominant bacterial communities still exhibit some variations (Fig.\u00a03). Interestingly, the large distance separating sample Q from the same borehole samples M and O is consistent with its unfrozen state as part of an under lake talik (Table\u00a01A). Statistical analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) confirms these observations (Fig. S7, Supporting Information) showing that the distances between samples from the same borehole are not significantly lower than the distances between samples from different boreholes (R = 0.388, P < 0.069).", "As a complimentary attempt to interpret the microbiome differences between samples, we screened the Pfam database, identified a total of 9481 motifs associated with specific protein families and/or molecular functions, and computed their distribution across samples. We expected that this type of analysis could reveal ecological/environmental constraints shared by various samples in spite of their different microbial communities. A list of the 50 most abundant Pfam motifs globally found in our dataset is given in Table S6 (Supporting Information). This list includes 7 of the 20 most abundant motifs found in the whole Pfam database, supporting the validity of our annotation protocol. Figure\u00a04A presents a Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity map computed from the Pfam counts in the samples. This map confirmed the functional similarity of the L-N-R samples, of the P-K samples (with the insertion of M from a different borehole, but from a similar depth and age as K) and to a lesser extent of two surface soil samples (D, E). The rest of the samples exhibited unrelated functional patterns, with the unfrozen talik-derived sample Q as the most dissimilar.", "Figure 4.Analysis of the functional similarity between samples.

(B) Heat map of the abundance of Pfam motifs potentially associated with bacterial virulence factors.", "Table S6 (Supporting Information) also indicated the presence of three Pfam motifs, found in proteins involved in bacterial antibiotic resistance: TetR-like transcription regulators (PF00440, ranked 29th/9481), metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (PF00753, ranked 44th) and glyoxalases (PF00903, ranked 46th). This prompted us to focus our next analysis on Pfam motifs putatively associated with virulence factors, the results of which are presented as a heat map in\u00a0Fig.\u00a04B. In this graph, three different protein families associated with bacterial antibiotic resistance appear to be largely dominant. The top one corresponds to a large family of enzymes catalyzing different reactions, including glyoxalases, dioxygenases and bleomycin/fosfomycin resistance proteins. Unfortunately, this Pfam motif is not specific enough to distinguish the minority of proteins truly involved in antibiotic inactivation from the rest of the family. Fortunately, the next most abundant functional families (\u03b2-lactamases and metallo-\u03b2-lactamases) are much better defined and for the most part correspond to enzymes active against various types of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Their distribution is further analyzed in the next section. Finally, the less abundant TetR (tetracycline resistance) family in the heat map is defined by an ambiguous motif found in a large diversity of DNA-binding proteins most of which are not involved in antibiotic resistance.", "Bacteria carrying \u03b2-lactamase genes", "Given the central role of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBL) in the spread of multiple bacterial antibiotic resistances (Cant\u00f3n et\u00a0al. 2012, Potron et al. 2015, Wright 2019) we specifically investigated the presence and diversity of these proteins/enzymes in our dataset. Although the ancient microorganisms trapped in the pristine permafrost layers studied here have little probability to come in direct contact with human beings, the risk remains that they might contribute to new \u03b2-lactam resistances once in contact with modern bacterial species.", "A total of 1071 \u03b2-lactamase genes were detected by diamond blastP against RefSeq and confirmed by a domain search (Fig. S9, Supporting Information). Among them, 1066 were found in bacterial contigs, 4 in an archaeal contigs and 1 in an ambiguous contig. Figure\u00a05 presents the numbers, origins and classes of bacterial \u03b2-lactamases. Although these numbers are small compared with the total number of contigs (Table S1, Supporting Information), they nevertheless suggest that, in average, most (87%) of the sampled Bacteria harbor one copy of a \u03b2-lactamase gene, once normalized by the frequency of 120 known single copy genes detected in each sample (Fig.\u00a05; Table S4, Supporting Information).", "Figure 5.Bacterial \u03b2-lactamase classes and copy numbers.

We noticed that the lowest prevalence of \u03b2-lactamase-encoding bacteria corresponds to samples from the same boreholes (L-R-N and Q-M), suggesting an actual ecological constraint. In most cases, we identified a single \u03b2-lactamase copy per contig, except for 17 contigs carrying several occurrences.

We thus simply compared the relative abundance of each bacterial phylum within the set of all cognate contigs with that of those exhibiting a \u03b2-lactamase gene. Bacteroidetes appeared to be the most enriched group in \u03b2-lactamase genes, while Planctomycetes exhibited the lowest proportion.

Accordingly, only 434 datasets were found suitable to be further analyzed by our protocol. If the average number of \u03b2-lactamase genes per bacteria was again found to be close to one, it was quite variable (mean: 1.09\u00a0\u00b1 0.77) (Fig.\u00a07). Interestingly, if our samples did not stand out, other permafrost samples from Alaska and north Sweden ranked high in the list (Fig.\u00a07). The samples with most occurrences of \u03b2-lactamase genes per bacteria were agricultural soils followed by riparian soils. There is significantly more \u03b2-lactamase copy number in agricultural samples than in other terrestrial soils except for the JGI permafrost samples and riparian soils (Fig.\u00a07). Bog and forest soils also exhibited \u03b2-lactamase gene copy numbers close to one.
