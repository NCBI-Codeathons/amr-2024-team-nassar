["Results", "Acute cytotoxicity of cadmium", "Continuous cadmium exposure for 8 or more weeks induces malignant transformation in RWPE-1 cells, producing the tumor-forming CTPE transformant (Achanzar et al. 2001). In the present study, CTPE and passage-matched RWPE-1 control cells were treated with cadmium for 24 hr, and cytotoxicity was measured. CTPE cells clearly acquired tolerance to the acute toxic effects of cadmium. The LC50 value for CTPE cells exposed to cadmium was 15.5 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcM compared with 7.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM in control cells\u2014a 2.2-fold difference reflecting a marked reduction in sensitivity.", "CTPE cells acquire generalized resistance to chemically induced apoptosis", "To determine if acquired apoptotic resistance occurred concurrently with cadmium-induced malignant transformation, control and CTPE cells were treated with cadmium and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Cadmium-induced apoptosis was markedly reduced in CTPE cells compared with control cells (Figure 1A). These results indicate that after transformation has occurred, cells acquired a marked resistance to apoptosis induced by cadmium. Furthermore, to detect whether the CTPE cells possessed generalized apoptotic resistance, control and CTPE cells were treated with etoposide, a DNA repair inhibitor and potent apoptogen, or cisplatin, a chemo-therapeutic compound, for 24 hr. Analysis of the flow cytometry data revealed that CTPE cells had about 40% fewer apoptotic cells than control when exposed to either etoposide or cisplatin (Figure 1B).", "Cadmium-transformed phenotype shows reduced JNK1/2 phosphorylation and JNK1/2 kinase activity", "The JNK and p38 pathways have been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis induced by various stimuli (Xia et al. 1995). Several recent articles have suggested that ERK might also be involved in apoptotic signaling (e.g., Mohr et al. 1998). To determine which signal pathway may be involved in cadmium-induced apoptosis, cells were acutely subjected to cadmium (0, 10, 50 or 100 \u03bcM) for 30 min. The levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 were determined by Western blot analysis. All three MAPKs were phosphorylated in a cadmium concentration-dependent fashion both in control and CTPE cells. Interestingly, the level of phosphorylated JNK1/2 was markedly decreased in the CTPE cells compared with control cells (Figure 2A). The membrane used to define the phosphorylated form was stripped, then reprobed with antibody against JNK that recognizes both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms to assess total JNK1/2. As shown in Figure 2B, no major differences were observed in the levels of total JNK1/2. Thus, the decrease in phosphorylated JNK represents a decrease in phosphorylation of the native protein in transformed cells rather than a reduction in total cellular JNK protein. The levels of both phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 did not show any significant differences between control and CTPE cells (data not shown). Dual phosphorylation of JNKs at Thr183/Tyr185 is essential for kinase activity and phosphorylation at these sites is an excellent marker of JNK activity. To confirm JNK activation, an in vitro kinase assay was performed using a c-Jun N-terminal fusion protein as the substrate. After acute cadmium exposure, JNK kinase activation was markedly reduced in CTPE cells compared with control cells in both the concentration\u2013response and time-course analysis (Figure 2C). The levels of phosphorylation of JNK determined by using the phospho-specific antibody were thus consistent with the kinase activity of JNK in cell extracts.", "Effect of Ro318220 on JNK1/2 kinase activity and apoptosis", "The compound Ro318220 (Ro) is a strong activator of JNK (Beltman et al. 1996; Sandau et al. 1999). Thus, studies were designed to determine if Ro318220 could bypass the blockage of JNK kinase activity in CTPE cells. Cells were pre-treated with Ro318220 (10 \u03bcM, 30 min) followed by acute cadmium exposure (100 \u03bcM, 30 min), and an in vitro kinase assay was performed using a c-Jun N-terminal fusion protein as the substrate. As shown in Figure 3A, after cadmium treatment JNK kinase activity was much lower in CTPE cells compared with control, confirming early experiments. However, pretreatment with Ro318220 before cadmium effectively bypassed this block in JNK activity, bringing JNK kinase activity in CTPE cells to control levels. EGF, used as a positive control for stimulating JNK activity, was much less effective in CTPE than control cells. These results suggest that the activation of the JNK pathway is perturbed in CTPE cells, specifically at the point of JNK phosphorylation. To confirm that the effects of Ro318220 depend JNK1/2 activation and are not due to protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition, similar experiments were performed with staurosporine (40 nM) and GF109203 (2.5 mM), two well-known PKC inhibitors (Beltman et al. 1996; Sandau et al. 1999). In contrast to the effects of Ro318220 on JNK kinase activation, both staurosporine and GF109203 did not affect JNK kinase activation in either control or CTPE cells. To determine if JNK activation through Ro318220 could bypass the apoptotic block seen after cadmium-induced transformation, cells were pretreated with Ro318220 before cadmium treatment and apoptosis was assessed (Figure 3B). Cadmium was again markedly less effective in inducing apoptosis in CTPE cells compared with control. The addition of Ro318220 before acute cadmium treatment significantly increased apoptotic rate between 2.6- and 3.7-fold in CTPE cells.", "Expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes", "Bax is an important pro-apoptotic protein and Bcl-2 is an important anti-apoptotic protein. It has been reported that multiple signal transduction pathways, including JNK, are capable of modifying Bcl-2 family members to reset susceptibility to apoptosis (Kharbanda et al. 2000; Yamamoto et al. 1999). Thus, the transcriptional levels of Bcl-2 and Bax in CTPE and control were determined. Both Bcl-2 and Bax transcript levels were significantly different in CTPE cells compared with control cells. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax transcripts was increased over 2-fold in CTPE cells compared with control cells (Figure 4A). These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Figure 4B). The levels of Bcl-2 protein were substantially increased (~ 5-fold), whereas the level of Bax protein was markedly decreased (~ 2-fold) in the CTPE cells. The densitometric analysis showed that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, which is though to be an important determinant in dictating apoptosis, was significantly increased (more than 4-fold) in CTPE cells (Figure 4C), a finding indicative of reduced apoptosis.", "Bcl-2 suppresses the JNK1/2 phosphorylation and apoptosis induced by cadmium", "To help define any possible interplay between Bcl-2 and JNK1/2, Bcl-2 was transfected via a murine expression vector into PT-67 cells. Expression of Bcl-2 protein was detected stably in Bcl-2\u2013transfected cells, but not in control cells (Figure 5A). Next, vector control and Bcl-2\u2013transfected cells were treated with cadmium (5 \u03bcM) or etoposide (50 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 hr, and apoptosis was determined. Cadmium-induced apoptosis was markedly reduced in Bcl-2\u2013transfected cells compared with vector control cells (Figure 5B). Moreover, etoposide-induced apoptosis was also significantly decreased in Bcl-2\u2013expressing cells. Furthermore, the effect of acute cadmium treatment on JNK1/2 phosphorylation in either vector control or Bcl-2\u2013trans-fected cells was examined. As expected, the level of phosphorylated JNK1/2 was markedly decreased in Bcl-2\u2013transfected cells (Figure 5C). The membrane used to define the phosphorylated form was stripped, then reprobed with antibody against JNK that recognizes both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms to assess total JNK1/2. No major differences were observed in the levels of total JNK1/2 (Figure 5D). Taken together, these data suggest that Bcl-2 might modulate the JNK signaling cascade, which in turn prevents cadmium-induced apoptosis.", "To determine whether the BH4 region of Bcl-2 is essential for its anti-apoptotic function, Bcl-2 Y21 mutant cell line was established by site-specific mutagenesis, which replaced the tyrosine with a serine at the 21st amino acid of Bcl-2 (Huang et al. 1997). Vector control, Bcl-2\u2013transfected, and Bcl-2 Y21 mutant cells were treated with cadmium or etoposide for 24 hr, and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Both cadmium- and etoposide-induced apoptosis were markedly reduced in Bcl-2\u2013transfected cells but restored largely in Bcl-2 Y21 mutant cells (Figure 6A). Furthermore, the effect of acute cadmium treatment on JNK1/2 phosphorylation in vector control, Bcl-2\u2013transfected, and Bcl-2 Y21 mutant cells was examined. Most interestingly, the level of phosphorylated JNK1/2 was markedly decreased in Bcl-2\u2013transfected cells but partially restored in Bcl-2 Y21 mutant cells (Figure 6B). The membrane used to define the phosphorylated form was stripped, then reprobed with antibody against JNK that recognizes both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms to assess total JNK1/2. No major differences were observed in the levels of total JNK1/2 (Figure 6C). These data indicate that the Bcl-2 BH4 domain is involved in modulating JNK phosphorylation and its anti-apoptotic function."]
