To test this hypothesis, we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of several plant-derived phytochemicals in the absence and presence of several known EPIs.", "Efflux inhibition increased ethidium bromide (EtBr) accumulation", "We started by testing the activity of the EPIs on Pb1692 efflux inhibition. For this purpose, a common assay measuring the accumulation of the EP substrate EtBr inside the bacterial cells was used (Coldham et\u00a0al., 2010). As shown previously by Coldham et\u00a0al., 2010, the concentration of EtBr is expected to increase within the cells in correlation with EP inhibition. The positive control in these assays are dead cells, where the efflux is abolished by the lack of an active electrochemical gradient, in which EtBr accumulates undisturbed inside the cells (Reens et\u00a0al., 2018). The control for the inhibitory effect is live Pb1692 cells, without exposure to EPIs, and thus, fully functional EPs. Therefore, we expect to have the highest fluorescent (i.e. EtBr accumulation) in the heat-killed bacteria and the lowest fluorescent in live cells where the EP is fully functional.", "EtBr accumulation (higher florescent level), revealed that PA\u03b2N was more effective in the inhibition of the efflux activity in Pb1692 than NMP or quinoline (\nFigure\u00a01\n). Even at 25 \u03bcM of PA\u03b2N and 0.1 mM of NMP the efflux activity was inhibited (\nFigure\u00a01A\n). In the case of quinoline, no accumulation of EtBr was observed leading to a similar pattern as the control treatment, for the tested concentrations 15 and 20 \u03bcM (\nFigure\u00a01B\n).
