["Results", "In vitro biosynthesis of the tetracyclic crocagin core", "It had been reported that the protein CgnB binds to the precursor peptide CgnA, and that a cgnB knockout abolished the production of crocagins A and B24. Interestingly, a knockout of the cgnB homologue cgnE (38% sequence identity; Supplementary Fig. 2) resulted in a reduction of crocagin production and the detection of two new species: one had a mass suggestive of 1 unmodified at the Trp C\u03b2 position, while the other agreed with a des-N-methyl, des-carbamoyl 1 (Supplementary Fig. 2).", "To begin our investigation of the biosynthesis of 1 and 2, we decided to focus on the operon containing cgnA, which encodes the precursor peptide CgnA, and putative biosynthetic gene products CgnB, CgnC, CgnD, and CgnE. CgnC was predicted to be a dioxygenase, and the putative esterase CgnD was a likely candidate for leader peptide removal. We thus initially focused on CgnB, CgnC and CgnE. Incubation of CgnA with either CgnB, CgnE or both did not result in any observable product peak (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3). Expression of CgnC required the use of an alternative, upstream start codon (Supplementary Fig. 4), and incubation with CgnA did not lead to observable product formation, unless FeCl2, ascorbic acid and \u03b1-ketoglutarate were added (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5). The addition of these cofactors, always implied in CgnC reactions from this point forward, yielded a new peak with a mass suggestive of hydroxylation (+16\u2009Da), but the predominant peak remained unmodified CgnA (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5). The addition of CgnE to CgnA\u2013CgnC led to the formation of an additional, minor peak with a mass shift of +28\u2009Da, which could indicate two oxidation events, for example, oxidation to ketones at the C\u03b2 atoms of the Tyr and Trp residues of the core peptides (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5). Intriguingly, the addition of the CgnE homologue CgnB led to a different result, with two additional product peaks detected when compared to CgnA\u2013CgnE or CgnA\u2013CgnC reactions (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5). One of these had a mass shift of +14\u2009Da, which could indicate the formation of the tetracyclic core structure (3a; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5). These data agree with the knockout studies, where the inactivation of cgnE led to reduced product formation, while the inactivation of cgnB abolished the production of 1 and 2. The addition of both CgnB and CgnE to CgnA\u2013CgnC reactions had a profound effect and led to the formation of a major product with high turnover (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5). This product, 3a, had a mass shift of +14\u2009Da, the same retention time as that observed for the +14\u2009Da product of CgnA\u2013CgnB\u2013CgnC reactions, and lost its UV absorption at 280\u2009nm, implying loss of aromaticity of the Trp side chain (Supplementary Fig. 5).Fig. 2In vitro biosynthesis of the crocagin core structure.a, Extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of CgnA (magenta) and reactions of CgnA with CgnB and CgnE; CgnC; CgnB and CgnC; CgnC and CgnE; or CgnB, CgnC and CgnE (from top left to right).

MS2 of the +28\u2009Da species was not possible due to low abundance, but MS2 of the +30\u2009Da peak placed +14\u2009Da on the core peptide\u2019s Tyr (keto group) and +16\u2009Da on the core peptide\u2019s Trp residue (hydroxylation; Supplementary Fig. 6). We were able to identify a low abundance +32\u2009Da species, and, as expected, MS2 analysis placed hydroxylations on the core peptide\u2019s Tyr and Trp (Supplementary Fig. 6). All mass errors can be found in Supplementary Table 1. A minor product with a mass shift of +12\u2009Da, 3b, was also observed. We reasoned that this could be an intermediate towards 2, with a mass of \u20132\u2009Da compared to crocagin A due to its additional double bond (Supplementary Fig. 5). NMR analysis of 3a confirmed the presence of the hexahydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole fused to a tetrahydropyrimidinone moiety (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2) and thus the successful in vitro biosynthesis of the tetracyclic crocagin core.", "CgnB and CgnE may have evolved from Zn2+-dependent aminopeptidases", "We were very intrigued by the different behaviour of the homologues CgnB and CgnE in biochemical assays. CgnB and CgnE did not show similarity to any family in the Pfam database, and a sequence-based search using the HHpred server28 returned only three hits with more than 50% sequence coverage, which were aminopeptidases (Pfam family Peptidase_M29). We did not observe aminopeptidase activity, and the sequence identities of CgnB and CgnE with the aminopeptidases were <25% (Supplementary Fig. 7). It was thus apparent that structural information would be valuable to better characterize these two proteins. First, the structure of CgnE was determined to 2.0\u2009\u00c5 (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 8).

We determined the CgnB structure to 2.3\u2009\u00c5 resolution but observed no electron density for CgnA, so the peptide may simply have acted as an additive to promote crystallization. As expected for homologous proteins, the C\u03b1 root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the structures of CgnB and CgnE was only 1.2\u2009\u00c5 over 284 residues (Supplementary Fig. 9). Curiously, CgnB contained a dinuclear metal centre that was partially occupied. The CheckMyMetal validation server29 suggested that either Zn2+ or Co2+ could be bound and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) identified the metals as zinc, with only traces of cobalt found (Supplementary Fig. 10). The binding sites comprised CgnB residues Glu161, Glu252 (shared between Zn2+\n1 and 2), Glu274 and His280 (Zn2+\n1) and His291 and Asp293 (Zn2+\n2; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 10). In CgnE, the metal binding site of Zn2+\n1 was disrupted by mutations in two metal-coordinating residues (CgnB numbering), Glu274Lys and His280Tyr, and no density for metal ions was observed in the CgnE structure (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 10). To exclude the possibility that CgnE may bind Fe2+, which is added as a CgnC cofactor to the reactions and could be oxidized and released from CgnE before structure determination, we incubated the protein with a large excess of fresh FeCl2 and processed the sample immediately for analysis by ICP-MS. No iron could be detected (Supplementary Fig. 10).", "A search for structural homologues of CgnB and CgnE using the DALI server30 returned only three viable hits, which concurred with the sequence-based results obtained from HHpred28: aminopeptidase T (Protein Data Bank (PDB) no. 2ayi), aminopeptidase PepS (PDB no. 4ics) and aminopeptidase AMPS (PDB no. 1zjc), which are structural homologues (C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. 4ics/1zjc\u2009=\u20092.2\u2009\u00c5; C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. 4ics/2ayi\u2009=\u20094.3\u2009\u00c5 over >90% of residues; Supplementary Fig. 10). The key difference between CgnB or CgnE and the aminopeptidases was found in the N-terminal portions of the proteins (Supplementary Fig. 11). The aminopeptidases form an extensive dimer interface, and the residues involved in its formation are largely missing in CgnB and CgnE, which rationalizes their monomeric state in the crystals. All three aminopeptidases harbour dinuclear metal centres in the same position as CgnB and contain either Zn2+ or Co2+. To test the effect of different metal ions on the reaction among CgnA, CgnB, CgnC and CgnE, we dialysed CgnB extensively with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and reduced the Zn2+ concentration to background (buffer) levels (Supplementary Fig. 10). Unfortunately, the protein denatured in the process, and activity could not be restored.", "Inference of protein complex formation between CgnB, CgnC and CgnE", "The requirement for all three components\u2014CgnB, CgnC and CgnE\u2014to be present for efficient catalysis of the formation of 3a or 3b implied that the proteins may interact. We probed each protein\u2019s ability to bind the substrate CgnA by microscale thermophoresis (MST) and found that CgnB and CgnE, but not CgnC, were able to bind CgnA (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 12). The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 10.5\u2009\u00b5M for the CgnA\u2013CgnB interaction is approximately one order of magnitude lower than that measured by surface plasmon resonance24 and five times weaker than the one we determined for the CgnA\u2013CgnE interaction (1.8\u2009\u00b5M; Fig. 3c). When we investigated the binding of the homologues CgnB and CgnE to CgnC, we found the CgnE\u2013CgnC KD to be ~1\u2009\u00b5M (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 13). The CgnB\u2013CgnC KD was weaker (~6\u2009\u00b5M), and no interaction could be detected for CgnB\u2013CgnE (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 13). We wondered if the presence of CgnA would change this behaviour and determined the KD of CgnC to CgnB in the presence of CgnA (400\u2009\u00b5M). The effect was an ~60-fold improved affinity to ~100\u2009nM (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 13). Addition of CgnA (400\u2009\u00b5M) to CgnC\u2013CgnE had very little effect (2-fold increase) on the CgnC\u2013CgnE affinity (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 14). It therefore appeared that CgnB and CgnE might be recruiting the substrate CgnA to CgnC. When we analysed the binding of CgnA to CgnB in the presence of a large excess of CgnE (250\u2009\u00b5M), we did not observe binding (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 13). This implied that CgnB and CgnE cannot bind simultaneously to the same substrate molecule. To support our MST data, we attempted pull-down assays. While these confirmed the interactions between CgnA and CgnB or CgnE, we could not find conditions that prevented CgnC from binding non-specifically to resin materials. The same was observed for surface plasmon resonance measurements (Supplementary Fig. 13).", "Size-exclusion chromatography data suggested that CgnB and CgnE were monomers in solution (as observed in the crystal structures), while CgnC was a dimer (Supplementary Fig. 13). Unfortunately, putative CgnB\u2013CgnC\u2013CgnE complexes were unstable in size-exclusion chromatography, and experiments to stabilize them for structure elucidation and detailed mechanistic studies are currently underway. The question we then asked was whether binding of CgnB and CgnE would occur at the same binding site on CgnC, as might be expected for homologues. We thus determined the affinity of CgnB\u2013CgnC in the presence of a constant, large excess (250\u2009\u00b5M) of CgnE. We obtained a KD of 28\u2009\u00b5M, which was approximately five times weaker than in the absence of CgnE, but these data still suggested that CgnB and CgnE can concurrently bind to CgnC (Supplementary Fig. 13). Taken together, our data imply that a complex may form during crocagin biosynthesis. If CgnC bound CgnB and CgnE at the same time, as MST measurements suggest it could, the dimeric nature of CgnC would likely result in a complex with the stoichiometry CgnB2/CgnC2/CgnE2 and have the ability to bind up to four CgnA molecules.", "Genome mining using CgnB and CgnE reveals crocagin-like BGCs", "The unique features of CgnB and CgnE prompted us to investigate their evolution. Sequence similarity searches in bacterial whole-genome sequencing contigs revealed that CgnB and CgnE homologues can be found in ~100 genomes from Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. In all cases, the similarity stretched over almost the entire protein length, and the homologues did not contain any additional domains, which makes CgnB and CgnE the founding members of a new protein family.", "In all genomes containing only one copy of a CgnB or CgnE homologue, the metal binding site was intact, despite an overall low sequence identity (between 21% and 42%). Finding two CgnB and/or CgnE homologues in the same genomic contig was much rarer (Supplementary Table 4), and in all cases, these two copies lie at a distance <2.1\u2009kbp. To investigate the evolution of the duplicated CgnB and CgnE homologues, we constructed a bootstrapped maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. 14 and Supplementary Information). Low bootstrap values did not allow many internal branches to be resolved with certainty, but it appears probable that three to five duplication events occurred during the evolution of this protein family. In every case, the second copy of the protein acquired deleterious mutations in the metal binding site that were different in each case. Mutations designed to restore metal binding in CgnE or disrupt metal binding in CgnB led to insoluble protein for all mutations tested. It is remarkable that at least three duplication events happened independently, which may be a sign of strong evolutionary pressure to acquire a second, mutated copy of the protein.", "Genome mining for novel RiPPs using instances of a single copy of CgnB or CgnE with the program RiPPER31 resulted in the discovery of a number of putative precursor peptides (Supplementary Data), which were used to create a sequence similarity network (Supplementary Fig. 15). In genomic contigs harbouring two CgnB or CgnE copies, we searched for a potential precursor and were able to find a candidate within <1.5\u2009kbp in all cases (Supplementary Table 4). Aligning these candidate peptides at their C termini revealed a strong conservation pattern for the Tyr and Trp positions of the core peptide (Ile-Tyr-Trp for crocagin; Supplementary Table 4). The Ile position is variable, and we found an Ile to Gly mutation to be a very good substrate for CgnB, CgnC or CgnE (Supplementary Fig. 16). Two other single leader peptide point mutations in highly conserved positions also had no effect on processing (Lys2Glu and Gly17Phe; Supplementary Fig. 16).", "The leader peptide is enriched with positively charged amino acids, and both CgnB and CgnE show a large, strongly negatively charged patch near the possible binding site (Supplementary Fig. 16). Of the six positively charged residues in the 18-amino-acid-long CgnA leader peptide (CgnALP), three are found in the N-terminal half, while the other three are close to the core peptide (Fig. 3d). Deleting residues 1\u20135 of CgnA (and thus two lysines; Fig. 3d) had no effect on turnover, but removing residues 1\u201310, which include a third lysine, abolished processing (Supplementary Fig. 17). To analyse the importance of the positively charged residues, we reacted a CgnA variant with the three N-terminal lysines mutated to alanine (CgnAN3A; Lys2Ala, Lys3Ala and Lys6Ala) with CgnBCgnC\u2013CgnE and found the reaction to be somewhat impaired (Supplementary Fig. 17). Exchanging the three C-terminal positively charged residues to alanine (CgnAC3A; Arg13Ala, Lys15Ala and Lys16Ala), on the other hand, severely reduced product formation (Supplementary Fig. 17). These data imply that essential CgnA residues for substrate recognition are located after position five and include four positively charged residues.", "The structures of the putative crocagin-like BGCs identified here differ in all genomes, but one can identify five key architectures (Fig. 3e). The crocagin BGC is an outlier, and intriguingly all other clusters contain a predicted glycosyltransferase instead of the carbamoyltransferase present in the crocagin BGC. This suggests that crocagin-like natural products may be glycosylated, which has thus far been a very rare modification in RiPPs. Some BGCs contain a predicted decarboxylase, which may remove the negative charge of crocagin-like molecules and thus improve membrane permeability in addition to providing biosynthetic access to new structural variants.", "Protease CgnD releases the crocagin core scaffold", "The product of the CgnB\u2013CgnC\u2013CgnE reaction, 3a, contained the crocagin tetracyclic ring system, and we thus suspected that proteolytic removal of the leader peptide by CgnD might be possible. When CgnD was added to the product of CgnA\u2013CgnB\u2013CgnC\u2013CgnE reactions containing 3a and 3b, we observed the slow production of 4a ([M]+ calculated, 495.2238; observed, 495.2239; mass error (\u0394)\u2009=\u20090.2\u2009ppm), which represents the crocagin core scaffold (des-methyl and des-carbamoyl) and also corresponds to the mass produced by the cgnE knockout (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 18). Interestingly, we again observed a minor peak of \u20132\u2009Da (4b; [M]+ calculated, 493.2082; observed, 493.2083; \u0394\u2009=\u20090.2\u2009ppm), which may be the core scaffold of crocagin B (Supplementary Fig. 18). Slow proteolytic processing of modified precursor peptides has been observed in a number of RiPP biosynthetic pathways and may be linked to biosynthetic timing32. In an attempt to accelerate the production of 4a, we replaced the Asn residue preceding the core peptide with a Lys. This mutant was a very poor substrate for CgnB\u2013CgnC\u2013CgnE, possibly because the introduced positive charge interfered with native substrate binding. The addition of trypsin did lead to the formation of traces of 4a (Supplementary Fig. 18). Rapid production of crocagin-like molecules will thus require the selection of alternative proteases or enzyme engineering of CgnD. To rationalize the slow turnover, we attempted to determine the affinity of CgnD for 3a, CgnA and the leader peptide, but were unable to detect binding by microscale thermophoresis (Supplementary Fig. 19). We hoped that the crystal structure of CgnD might yield additional insights and determined the structure to 2.35\u2009\u00c5 resolution (Supplementary Fig. 20). The two protomers found in the asymmetric unit form an intricate dimer interface (Supplementary Table 6), which is unlike that of the closest structural homologues identified by a Dali server30 search. Intriguingly, it appeared as if the dimer provides two antiparallel channels for substrate binding that terminated at the respective active sites (Fig. 4b). The catalytic triad comprised Asp325, His328 and Ser79, and the distance observed between the Asp325 atom O\u03b42 and His328 atom H\u03b42 was within the expected range (1.8\u2009\u00c5). The distance between His328 atom N\u03b52 and Ser79 atom H\u03b3 could not be determined because a sulfate ion was bound at the active site, which led to a rotation of the Ser side chain. Removal of the sulfate in silico and subsequent rotation of the Ser side chain did not allow the distance to decrease below 2.8\u2009\u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. 20). The resulting lack of nucleophilicity appeared a probable cause for the slow turnover and was supported by our inability to label CgnD with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Supplementary Fig. 20). This situation is reminiscent of PatA from the patellamide pathway, which also turns over very slowly32.Fig. 4Processing of 3a and 3b by CgnD and CgnL.a, In vitro biosynthesis of the crocagin A core scaffold, 4a, using CgnD. m/z represents mass divided by charge number and the horizontal axis in a mass spectrum is expressed in units of m/z. b, Surface representation of the CgnD dimer.

Based on sequence alignments, CgnL, named \u2018MT\u2019 in the original crocagin publication24, was the likely candidate. Indeed, incubation of 4a and 4b with CgnL and S-adenosylmethionine led to the formation of 5a ([M]+ calculated, 509.2395; observed, 509.2391; \u0394\u2009=\u2009\u20130.8\u2009ppm) and the \u20132\u2009Da 5b ([M]+ calculated, 507.2238; observed, 507.2239; \u0394\u2009=\u20090.2\u2009ppm; Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 21). The mass increase of +14\u2009Da suggested methylation and thus the production of des-carbamoyl 1 and 2.", "The crystal structure of CgnL in complex with S-adenosylhomocysteine was determined to a resolution of 1.96\u2009\u00c5 and appeared monomeric, which was consistent with the closest structural homologues of CgnL identified in a Dali search30. The overall shape of CgnL was typical for class I S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases with a Rossman fold (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 22). The electron density for S-adenosylhomocysteine was unambiguous as expected for a well-coordinated ligand (Supplementary Fig. 22). Interestingly, the closest structural homologues with a defined function are involved in natural product biosynthetic pathways: CcbJ (PDB no. 4hh4) N-methylates the antibiotic celesticetin33, while KedS8 (PDB no. 5bsz) N-methylates the chromophore of the anticancer chromoprotein kedaricidin34.", "A proposed mechanism for the biosynthesis of 3a and 3b", "The precise molecular mechanism of the initial step in crocagin biosynthesis, leading to the formation of 3a and 3b, will require further study. We favour the following sequence of events based on the knockout, biochemical and binding data (Fig. 5a): CgnA binds to CgnE, which may either be part of a CgnC\u2013CgnE complex, or bind to CgnC after binding CgnA. We found the binding of CgnE to the CgnALP to be almost 300 times weaker than binding to CgnA (KD\u2009=\u2009514\u2009\u00b5M; Supplementary Fig. 23). The main driver for binding thus appears to be the core peptide, and it is tempting to suggest that CgnE\u2019s role may be to recruit the substrate peptide to CgnC and present the core peptide in a particular way that enables or accelerates correctly timed catalysis. This would agree with our knockout and in vitro biochemical data, which show that the presence of CgnE without CgnB does not enable formation of the crocagin core structure. When we tested the mutant CgnA Y20F, we could only detect trace amounts of a +14\u2009Da species, and the major product peak had a mass increase of 16\u2009Da. (Supplementary Fig. 23). Unlike the +16\u2009Da product of a CgnA\u2013CgnC\u2013CgnE reaction (Trp hydroxylation; Supplementary Fig. 6), MS2 analysis of this intermediate revealed a mixture with hydroxylation of either Phe or Trp (Supplementary Fig. 24). Hydroxylation at the Tyr20 C\u03b2 position allows CgnB to catalyse an elimination reaction via its bound Zn2+ (or Co2+) ions, which results in a double bond between the Tyr20 C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 atoms, creating a conjugated amine. The transition state, in which the Tyr20 C\u03b1 hydrogen would possess a lowered pKa, could be stabilized by the Tyr side chain, rationalizing why a Tyr20Phe mutation is detrimental to turnover (Supplementary Fig. 23). Tyr20 then undergoes conjugate addition with the Trp21 indole nitrogen, and subsequent proton transfer completes the first ring-forming reaction. The second ring-closure reaction between the Trp \u03b1-nitrogen and \u03b41 carbon atom could then occur spontaneously to complete the formation of the tetracyclic ring system. It is unclear at which point hydroxylation of the Trp21 C\u03b2 position occurs, but the inferred biosynthetic complex would enable fast transfer from one substrate binding site to the next. Interestingly, CgnA binding by CgnB is not dependent on the core peptide to the same extent as observed for CgnE, with an 8-fold reduction in affinity for CgnALP compared to CgnA (Supplementary Fig. 23).Fig. 5Biosynthetic proposal leading to the formation of crocagins A (1) and B (2).a, Proposed mechanism for installation of the tetracyclic crocagin core. b, CgnB, CgnC and CgnE install two \u03b2-hydroxylations and facilitate the two ring-closure reactions. CgnD cleaves the core scaffold off the leader peptide, which is subsequently methylated and carbamoylated.

This was not the case for CgnB\u2013CgnC\u2013CgnE reactions, where turnover of the core peptide was marginal when the leader peptide was added in trans (Supplementary Fig. 23). This suggests that a physical connection between leader and core peptide is essential for catalysis, perhaps to enable efficient transfer of the substrate between CgnE and CgnB."]
