["RESULTS", "Genome sequence revealed biosynthetic potential of Sorangium sp. So ce836", "The So ce836 genome (GenBank accession: CP102233) has a size of 14,555,308\u2009bp and encodes 10,611 genes, including 10,570 protein\u2010coding sequences. Analysis with the bioinformatic tool antiSMASH (version 6.1.1) (Blin et al.,\u00a02021) predicted a total of 45 BGC regions. Our detailed analysis of the BGC regions showed that four of these likely constituted several BGCs (see below), resulting in a total of 52 BGCs. Among these BGCs, only six showed close similarity (i.e. above 60% amino acid similarity) to BGCs with known natural products reported in the MIBiG database (Table\u00a0S1) (Kautsar et al.,\u00a02019). Thirty BGCs encoded the syntheses of NRPs, PKs, or hybrids of these (Table\u00a0S1). Predicted BGCs encompassed a total of 414 genes, comprising 4% of all protein\u2010coding sequences in So ce836, and 307 of these (74%; 81 core biosynthetic, 131 additional biosynthetic, 42 transport\u2010related, 53 regulatory) were associated with the production of NRPs and PKs. The antiSMASH output labelled different types of genes with different colours, which we also utilize throughout this manuscript (\u2018core biosynthetic\u2019 in dark red, \u2018additional biosynthetic\u2019 in coral, \u2018transport\u2010related\u2019 in blue, and \u2018regulatory\u2019 in green).", "RNA sequencing identified temporal transcription patterns in a batch culture", "In a batch liquid culture incubated at 28\u00b0C with vigorous shaking, So ce836 grew with a minimum doubling time of 2.3\u2009days (Figure\u00a01).

These time points were selected on the basis of preliminary experiments to represent the phases of a full growth cycle. The transcription of 8311 genes (78% of all genes) varied significantly over the time\u2010course experiment, as indicated by a likelihood ratio test. These are referred to as \u2018differentially expressed\u2019 genes in the following text. In contrast, the transcription levels of 20% of all genes did not vary significantly between time points, and an additional 2% of genes were excluded from further analyses due to low read counts. To compare time courses of transcription between differentially expressed genes, we analysed deviations from the genes' mean transcription levels at five time points. We found that the timing of transcription varied widely, and k\u2010means clustering of these temporal patterns into five transcription groups clearly associated with maximal transcription at the different growth times (Figure\u00a02) (initially, a hierarchical clustering approach had justified the grouping into five groups; not shown). Genes in transcription group 1 (2435 genes, 29% of differentially expressed genes) showed a tendency for maximal transcription on day 4, that is during early exponential growth (Figure\u00a02). A majority of genes in transcription group 2 (1670 genes, 20%) were maximally transcribed on day 7 of the experiment, that is also during exponential growth (Figure\u00a02). In contrast, transcription group 3 (1876 genes, 23%) contained genes that were strongly transcribed at the beginning of the stationary phase (day 11), and the transcription of genes in groups 4 (1100 genes, 13%) and 5 (1230 genes, 15%) peaked on days 14 and 21, respectively (Figure\u00a02). Hence, in summary, transcription groups 1 and 2 mainly contained genes (totalling 39% of all genes) that reached their maximum transcription during exponential growth, whereas most genes in the other three transcription groups (3, 4, and 5; 40% of all genes) were maximally transcribed in later growth phases (Figure\u00a02).", "FIGURE 2Temporal transcription patterns of 8311 differentially expressed genes in the So ce836 genome.

However, a few BGC regions predicted by antiSMASH exhibited deviating transcription of their core genes over time, including BGC regions 7, 20, 25, and 41 (Figure\u00a0S2). Closer inspection showed that each of these regions likely constituted several BGCs (Figure\u00a0S3), since their BGC core genes were spatially separated or located on different DNA strands. Consequently, we split BGC region 7 into two subregions (7_1 and 7_2), corresponding to antiSMASH\u2010predicted core genes involved in the biosynthesis of resorcinol and a phenazine compound, respectively (Table\u00a0S1). Similarly, BGC region 20 was split into three subregions (20_1 \u2010 20_3) and region 41 was split into two (41_1, 41_2). BGC subregion 41_1 was predicted to encode the biosynthesis of a redox\u2010cofactor and the other subregions are likely involved in the production of NRPs or NRP/PK\u2010hybrids (Table\u00a0S1). We assigned genes other than core biosynthetic genes within overlapping regions to both BGC subregions (Figure\u00a0S3).", "FIGURE 3Temporal transcription of core biosynthetic genes of NRP\u2010 and PK\u2010related BGCs.

Region 25 included four spatially separated groups of BGC core genes (Figure\u00a0S4), three of which encoded thioesterase at the C\u2010terminal ends of their last core gene, suggesting independent biosynthetic pathways within this region (Schwarzer & Marahiel,\u00a02001). Subregion 25_3 represents the previously described epothilone BGC with a 100% protein similarity to MIBiG entries (BGC0000989\u2013BGC0000991; Julien et al.,\u00a02000; Moln\u00e1r et al.,\u00a02000; Tang et al.,\u00a02000; Zhu et al.,\u00a02013). Moreover, we indeed detected epothilone A production by So ce836 via LC/MS analysis (Figure\u00a04B). Subregion 25_4 shares 62% similarity and an identical gene order with the glidopeptin BGC (MIBiG entry BGC0001608; Wang et al.,\u00a02018).

A particularly large proportion of core biosynthetic genes (93%, 75 out of 81 core genes) were differentially expressed (p\u2010value\u00a0=\u00a04.88e\u20104).", "The majority of differentially expressed core genes from BGCs for PK and NRP syntheses were maximally transcribed on day 7 (60%) or day 4 (20%) (Figures\u00a03 and 5). Accordingly, 17 (23%) of the 75 differentially expressed core genes belonged to transcription group 1, and 44 (59%) to transcription group 2. This means a statistically significant over\u2010representation of core genes among the two groups, which both displayed a strong tendency for maximum transcription in the exponential growth phase (Figure\u00a02, Table\u00a0S2). Transport\u2010related genes and additional biosynthetic genes within BGCs often showed similar temporal trends of transcription as the core genes (Figures\u00a0S5 and S6). In contrast, transcription of regulatory genes from these BGCs exhibited deviating temporal patterns (Figure\u00a0S7). Of note, however, the smCOG\u2010based prediction of these accessory genes is less reliable than the rule\u2010based identification of core biosynthetic genes (Medema et al.,\u00a02011).

The transcription activity of most ribosomal protein genes also peaked during the exponential growth phase, but their temporal patterns nevertheless differed markedly from BGC core genes by showing additional transcription maxima on days 14 and 21 (Figure\u00a03, Figure\u00a0S8).", "Other BGC classes displayed more variable transcriptional patterns", "The So ce836 genome encodes 13 BGCs for potential RiPPs, six for terpenes, and one each for phosphonate, resorcinol, and phenazine compounds (Table\u00a0S1). The core genes of these BGC classes showed more diverse temporal transcription patterns compared to NRP\u2010 and PK\u2010related BGCs (Figures\u00a0S1, S9 and S10). From the 21 core genes of RiPP\u2010related BGCs, 15 were significantly differentially expressed and eight of these (53%) reached their maximal transcription level in the exponential phase (days 4 and 7) (Figure\u00a0S1). The BGCs associated with the production of terpenes contain six core genes (Figure\u00a0S9), only two of which were maximally transcribed in the exponential phase, whereas two reached their maximal transcription level in the death phase (at day 21). The resorcinol\u2010 and phenazine\u2010related BGCs are localized close to each other on the genome, but yet their temporal expression differed strongly, indicating different mechanisms of transcriptional regulation (Figure\u00a0S10). So ce836 was also predicted to produce a phosphonate, encoded by BGC region 38. The corresponding core gene was most strongly expressed in the early exponential phase (day 4) and in the death phase (day 21).", "BGC core gene expression was correlated with metabolite net production rates", "Strain So ce836 produced large amounts of the natural compound icumazole A. The concentration of icumazole A, as measured by HPLC based on its absorption of UV light (304\u2009nm, 15.27\u2009min retention time), was maximal on day 11 and decreased thereafter, suggesting the compound was catabolized by the bacterium or otherwise degraded (Figure\u00a04A, blue curve). We determined the net compound production rate (arbitrary units) at each time point by assessing the slope of the concentration curve and then related it to the concentration of bacterial cells in the culture at the same time point (as shown in Figure\u00a01) to estimate the net compound production rate per cell. As a result, we found that the net icumazole A production rate per myxobacterial cell peaked on day 7, that is during exponential growth (Figure\u00a04A, green curve). Strikingly, this net cellular icumazole A production rate correlated strongly with the transcriptional pattern of the 10 core genes from the icumazole BGC (r\u00a0=\u00a00.88; Xie et al.,\u00a02022), since the maximum deviation from mean transcription was also reached on day 7 (Figure\u00a04A, red curves).", "At the same time, we also detected epothilones in the metabolome of So ce836. Epothilone A was only weakly detectable by UV absorption (250\u2009nm, 9.05\u2009min retention time) at most time points, and since quantification of epothilone A by UV absorption and mass spectroscopy gave similar results for days 4\u201314 (Figure\u00a0S11), we relied on LC/MS mass peaks (494.2571\u2009m/z, 9.05\u2009min retention time) to estimate the relative concentration of epothilone A. Similar to icumazole A, the concentration of epothilone A in the growth medium was highest in the stationary phase (Figure\u00a04B, blue curve). Again, the net cellular production rate of epothilone A was maximal on day 7, and it correlated with the time course of transcription of epothilone BGC core genes (r\u00a0=\u00a00.78) (Figure\u00a04B, green and red curves).", "Taken together, we observed that bursts of BGC core gene transcription were accompanied by distinct surges in net production rates per cell for the two known compounds icumazole A and epothilone A. Even though temporal dynamics of normalized BGC core gene transcription and compound production rates were highly similar for these compounds (Figure\u00a04), absolute transcription levels of the core genes (i.e. sequencing read counts per kilobase) differed more than 100\u2010fold between associated BGCs (Table\u00a0S1, Figure\u00a0S8). Notably at maximum transcription on day 7, the median number of normalized sequencing read counts mapped to the icumazole BGC core genes was 428 per kilobase (1732\u201312,799 reads per gene), and for the epothilone BGC was only 3 per kilobase (13\u201355 reads per gene) (Figure\u00a06, Figure\u00a0S8). And on day 4, when almost no icumazole A net production was detectable, the median number of sequencing reads mapped to icumazole BGC core genes was at its minimum of 15 per kilobase (55\u2013399 reads per gene), but yet this number was larger than the maximal transcription level of the epothilone BGC core genes (Figure\u00a0S8). The transcript levels of other BGCs were intermediate between those of epothilone and icumazole BGCs, except for four BGCs with slightly lower read counts than the epothilone BGC and five BGCs that had even higher read counts per kilobase than the icumazole BGC, although we were unable to detect their (as yet unknown) natural products (Figure\u00a06, Table\u00a0S1).", "FIGURE 6Distribution of BGC read counts on their day of maximal transcription.

Out of 8311 differentially expressed genes, we could associate 6081 (73%) to COG categories using the eggNOG\u2010mapper (Cantalapiedra et al.,\u00a02021). We then performed an over\u2010/under\u2010representation analysis of COG categories within each of the five transcription groups (Table\u00a0S5). Among genes in transcription group 1 (maximally transcribed on day 4, i.e. during early exponential growth), COG categories E (\u2018Amino acid transport and metabolism\u2019), M (\u2018Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis\u2019) and F (\u2018Nucleotide transport and metabolism\u2019) were significantly over\u2010represented compared to their distribution among all annotated and differentially expressed genes in So ce836 (for adjusted p\u2010values based on the hypergeometric distribution with subsequent multiple testing correction, see Table\u00a0S5). In transcription group 2 (maximally transcribed on day 7), categories P (\u2018Inorganic ion transport and metabolism\u2019), J (\u2018Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis\u2019), H (\u2018Coenzyme transport and metabolism\u2019), and Q (\u2018Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism\u2019) were significantly over\u2010represented. Hence, the distribution of genes classified to COG category Q (\u2018Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism\u2019) confirmed our previous notion of BGC transcription mostly during exponential bacterial growth. In contrast, in transcription group 3 (maximally transcribed on day 11, i.e. during the early stationary phase), COG categories J, P, and E were significantly under\u2010represented, whereas category O (\u2018Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones\u2019) was over\u2010represented (although the latter was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing; Table\u00a0S5).
