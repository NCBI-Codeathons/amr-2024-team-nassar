["3. Results", "3.1. Inhibition of S. aureus Growth by IVM as Evidenced by Growth Curves and Time-Kill Kinetics", "The growth curve analysis demonstrated that IVM reduced the growth of O9, even at the low concentration of 1.56 \u03bcg/mL. On the other hand, IVM did not reduce the growth of O20 even at the high concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 1A,B). Similarly, the results of time-kill kinetics were the same as those of the growth curves. IVM showed reduction in CFU/mL as compared to the control (DMSO) for O9 but not for O20. The bacterial growth was completely inhibited by IVM at concentrations of \u226512.5 \u03bcg/mL for O9 whereas no inhibition was observed for the O20 strain in the presence of IVM up to 100 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 1C,D). Notably, as stated above since there are no established CLSI protocols for prediction of IVM resistance against S. aureus, hence for this study we have defined the sensitive and tolerant IVM strains as the ones which could be killed/survive in the presence of IVM at the concentrations of \u226512.5 or up to 100 \u03bcg/mL, respectively.", "3.2. Proteomic Analysis", "To observe if it is possible to distinguish why strains O9 and O20 were different towards their sensitivity to IVM, a two-shot proteomic analysis of S. aureus strains O20 and O9 was carried out. The protein contents of the bacterial isolates were analyzed by a LC-MS/MS MudPIT, which allows for a multidimensional analysis of the peptides (Figure 2).", "To increase the chances for identification and quantitation of peptides, in the LC-MS/MS analysis, a total of 12 unique gradients of the LC solvents were applied. This approach decreases the effect of co-isolation of peptides, resulting in a larger number of proteins identified. A total of 1846 proteins were identified in the dataset of strains O9 and O20, representing about 64% of the proteins from the reference proteome in UNIPROT database (total of 2889 protein entries in 2022) for S. aureus strain NCTC/PS47 (proteome ID: UP000008816). Specifically, 425 were only found in strain O9 and, 354 in strain O20 (Figure 3). After normalization of the label-free quantitative values by the emPAI method, the fold change calculation of only the characterized proteins (strain O9/strain O20) was performed.", "DNA binding (7.0% vs. 5.37%), RNA binding (5.76% vs. 6.90%), metal ion binding (9.42% vs. 10.73%), nucleotide binding (16.93% vs. 19.61%), catalytic activity (46.11% vs. 46.11%), were the main functions in most proteins of O20 vs. O9 strains, respectively. Interestingly, the function of transporter activity was found in about 5.23% of proteins from strain O20, while very few proteins with the transporter activity were detected in strain O9 (Figure 4). A total of 458 proteins were differentially expressed in O20 versus the O9 strain (fold change \u22651.65). Upon a functional enrichment analysis, 93 of these proteins have roles in cellular processes, 91 involved in metabolic processes, 14 in biological regulation, 9 involved in response to stimulus, 9 involved in localization, 8 are efflux pumps for transportation, 2 in cytolysis, 1 in cell adhesion, and 1 in cytokinesis (Figure 4, and Supplementary Materials (Protein Table)).", "Next, we performed a protein interaction network analysis. We matched the list of differentially expressed proteins to the known interactions of S. aureus within the STRING database. The connecting proteins in the networks are known interactors either as gene neighborhood, gene fusion, co-occurrence, co-expression, or homology (Figure 5A,B). The network of the upregulated proteins (Figure 5A) presented five main clusters, with the densest gene cluster (cluster 1) containing proteins related to cytoplasmic translation. Protein functions from clusters 2\u20135 were de novo IMP biosynthetic process, ATP synthesis, ligase activity, unfolded protein binding, respectively. The network of the downregulated proteins (Figure 5B) presented only one significative cluster containing proteins (cluster 1) with the nucleic acid binding function. The remaining proteins are involved in organonitrogen compound catabolic process (hutU and hutI genes), and biological regulation (leuS and valS genes).", "As our focus was to identify whether any transporters were involved in the IVM resistance phenotype so proteins only present or upregulated in strain O20 with roles in transportation are shown in Table 2. Proteins MsbA2, EmrB4, NorB3, and BTN44_13755 were only presented in the proteomic analysis of strain O20, while proteins EcsA3, YtrB1, MepA, and SwrC were more abundant (fold change >1.65) in strain O20. A list of all proteins quantified and normalized is presented in the Supplementary Materials (Protein Table). A hierarchical clustering analysis of the protein abundance is reported as a heatmap in Figure 6. For a detailed view of Figure 6, an interactive version can be found in the file \u201cHeatmap_SA.html\u201d, in the Supplementary Materials section.", "3.3. Validation of the Overexpressed Bacterial Proteins", "The mRNA quantification analysis by qPCR demonstrated that among the three target genes analyzed, swrC, mepA, and emrB were overexpressed in the O20 compared to the O9 strain (Figure 7)."]
