["2. Results", "2.1. CHD and CDCHD Were Effective against Clinically Relevant Uropathogens and Displayed Resistance-Breaking Properties In Vitro", "To further examine their broad-spectrum activities that were described previously [15,16,19], we tested both chelocardins against extended panels of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), with the compounds showing antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the low \u00b5g/mL range (Table S1). Besides their promising activity against MDR pathogens, both compounds were effective against typical uropathogens among these strains, supporting the potential use of chelocardins to treat UTIs [19,25]. This was further investigated by assaying MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of about 100 uropathogenic clinical isolates from a contemporary collection of the DZIF Microbial Genomic Resource Center (MGRC), including various MDR isolates (Table 1; all strains geno- and phenotyped).", "The antibacterial activity of both chelocardins was confirmed, and the MIC profiles of these uropathogenic isolates revealed to be similar for CHD and CDCHD. Although CDCHD tended to show slightly increased MICs, which is in contrast to results with non-clinical strains, the new lead molecule displayed a more favorable MBC profile compared to CHD. For selected K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates, MIC and MBC values were additionally determined in artificial urine (Table 2).", "Compared to values determined in standard test medium, CHD and CDCHD showed \u22484-fold improved antibacterial activities in artificial urine with a concurrent increase of bactericidal activity. The variation of pH between 5.5 and 8.5 in the artificial urine medium revealed generally pH-independent antibacterial activities (referring to MICs), but pH-dependent bactericidal activities with MBCs varying by factor 2\u201316 (Table S2). Altogether, the bactericidal activity of CDCHD was superior to CHD throughout the whole panel of isolates (except for Proteus sp.), and thus its improved potency was confirmed, also tendentially against P. aeruginosa, as reported previously [15]. Since Le\u0161nik et al. [15] presumed that differences in susceptibility against P. aeruginosa may rely on intrinsic resistance mechanisms such as efflux, we studied the activity of CHD and CDCHD against several efflux-deficient P. aeruginosa mutants [31,32,33]. A deletion of the major efflux pump MexAB increased susceptibility of both compounds up to 16-fold, which was also observed for tetracycline (Table S1), whereas deletions of efflux pumps MexCD, MexEF, and MexXY did not lead to increased activities of both compounds. However, since CDCHD is able to inhibit the non-clinical P. aeruginosa wild-type strains with 2\u20138 fold higher potency than CHD and tetracycline, CDCHD may at least partially overcome efflux-based resistance in P. aeruginosa for yet unknown reasons. Additionally, the previously reported capability of CHD to inhibit growth of tetracycline-resistant pathogens [21,22] was also shown for CDCHD by testing the susceptibility of strains carrying different sets of common tetracycline resistance determinants including efflux, ribosomal protection, and enzymatic inactivation factors (Table 3). The high potency of CDCHD to inhibit these strains confirmed its wide-ranging tetracycline resistance-breaking properties.", "2.2. CHD Resistance Development in Target Pathogens Revealed Mutation of ramR in K. pneumoniae", "Attempts to raise stable resistant mutants with CHD in E. coli or with CDCHD in K. pneumoniae and S. aureus were generally not successful, most likely due to strong bactericidal effects above threshold concentrations of one- to twofold MIC in the respective strains. In contrast, K. pneumoniae treated with increasing concentrations of CHD was susceptible to resistance development. The in vitro exposure to 2 \u00b5g/mL CHD led to strongly impaired growth of the wild-type strain K. pneumoniae DSM-30104 (Figure S1), and spontaneous resistant mutants occurring at an average frequency of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22128 (FoR) were isolated. Nine independent CHD-resistant mutants were selected and sequentially sub-cultivated until a final concentration of 8 \u00b5g/mL CHD was reached. All isolated resistant mutants displayed a significant and stable shift in MIC compared to the parent wild-type strain (Table S3). All mutants showed a normal, exponential growth behavior at 8 \u00b5g/mL concentration of CHD, with final cell densities comparable to the wild type (Figure S2), and thus no significant loss in fitness was observed. Cultivation of mutants under non-selective conditions (up to six passages of cultures grown from lag to stationary phase without CHD) did not reveal reversibility of the developed resistance, since a change of MICs was not observed after renewed exposure to CHD.", "Comparative whole-genome sequencing of the selected mutants vs. K. pneumoniae DSM-30104 wild type revealed, in addition to some inconsistent genomic changes, the regulatory gene ramR as the main target of CHD-dependent resistance mutations, which was affected either by nucleotide deletions, insertions, or substitutions (Table S4).", "2.3. Absence of Cross-Resistance to CDCHD", "Extended susceptibility studies of the resistant mutants revealed, in addition to the 4- to 16-fold elevated MICs for CHD compared to K. pneumoniae wild type, accompanying co-resistance to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and several tetracycline derivatives (Table S3). To confirm that decreased susceptibility relies on inactivated ramR, as suggested by the sequencing studies, we generated a K. pneumoniae DSM-30104 ramR knockout mutant (KP\u0394ramR) using a \u03bb-Red recombinase-based knockout system [34]. Indeed, susceptibility of KP\u0394ramR towards CHD was decreased by 8- to 16-fold, but only twofold towards CDCHD compared to wild type. Likewise, all tested CHD-resistant mutants showed no significant cross-resistance to CDCHD (Table S5).", "2.4. Resistance to CHD in K. pneumoniae Was Based on Efflux", "The gene product of ramR is a repressor of ramA, which, in turn, encodes a positive regulator of the AcrAB-TolC efflux system [35,36]. In the context of reduced antibiotic susceptibility, mutations in ramR have already been reported to be involved in efflux-mediated resistance to tigecycline in clinical K. pneumoniae isolates [37,38]. This led to the assumption that resistance to CHD might also rely on efflux. Thus, we examined the effect of the CHD-induced ramR mutations on the regulatory function of the AcrAB-TolC efflux system. In a first experiment, transcription levels of ramA, acrA, and acrB were analyzed by qPCR. As expected, in comparison to the wild type, an upregulation of ramA (up to 41-fold) with a concomitant upregulation of acrA (up to 12-fold) and acrB (up to 67-fold) was observed in all spontaneous K. pneumoniae-resistant mutants as well as in KP\u0394ramR (Table S5). In a second study, eight mutants (Mt8.1\u2013Mt8.8 with genomic changes indicated in Table S4) were subjected to gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq. This transcriptome study revealed that a broader range of regulatory factors was affected in the resistant mutants (Table 4). In addition to ramRA, further regulatory cascades involved in controlling acrAB-tolC gene expression were differentially expressed, among them the soxRS [39,40] and marRAB [36,41] operons, showing a strong upregulation of the soxS and marA activator genes, especially in mutants Mt8.3 and Mt8.6.", "This points to a more complex regulatory scenario involving cross-regulation and feedback regulation between and within these operons, which has been shown, for example, for the marbox-dependent activation of marRAB expression by a large number of regulators including RamA, SoxS, and MarA [42,43]. On the other hand, most of the mutants showed a downregulation of factors that negatively affect acrAB-tolC expression, including the acrR repressor gene [36] and the lon gene encoding Lon protease, which controls the protein levels of RamA, SoxS, and MarA by degradation [44,45].", "To further characterize the major effect of efflux on CHD resistance, we determined MICs by adding the efflux pump inhibitor phenylalanine arginine \u03b2-naphthylamide dihydrochloride (PA\u03b2N). All K. pneumoniae mutants showed both reduced resistance to CHD and reduced co-resistance to tetracycline, tigecycline, chloramphenicol, and ciprofloxacin in the presence of this inhibitor (Table S6), substantially reversing the developed resistance profiles shown in Table S3, while no difference in susceptibility was observed for the wild type. Importantly, PA\u03b2N had virtually no effect on the susceptibility towards CDCHD in all strains, demonstrating that its activity remains unaffected by the CHD-mediated resistance mechanism.", "2.5. ChdR Was Found to be the Primary Self-Resistance Factor in Natural CHD Producer A. sulphurea", "Upon identification of the CHD biosynthetic gene cluster [46], the chdR gene encoding a putative multidrug efflux resistance protein from the EmrB/QacA subfamily was hypothesized to provide a mechanism of self-resistance to A. sulphurea by serving as an exporter of the antibiotic. To test this hypothesis, a cosmid library of the A. sulphurea genome was prepared and expressed in A. mediterranei, a related species devoid of the CHD biosynthetic gene cluster and susceptible to CHD. It was found that only A. sulphurea genomic fragments carrying the chdR gene were able to confer resistance to CHD in A. mediterranei.", "Another attempt to identify further possible CHD resistance factors in the native producer was made by generating an A. sulphurea \u0394chdPKS \u0394chdAR double mutant devoid of the essential CHD biosynthetic genes chdPKS (encoding the minimal polyketide synthase) and the proposed resistance cassette chdAR (encoding ChdR and its regulator ChdA). The selected double mutant showed an MIC for CHD of 2.5 \u03bcg/mL, in contrast to the parent strain A. sulphurea \u0394chdPKS growing in the presence of >100 \u03bcg/mL of CHD [46], and was subjected to development of CHD-resistant mutants. Indeed, several resistant mutants carrying the \u0394chdPKS \u0394chdAR background were generated at CHD concentrations of 20\u201330 \u00b5g/mL (8- to 12-fold MIC), and a set of nine mutants was selected for further analysis (Table S7). A comparative whole-genome sequencing of reference strain vs. selected mutants revealed that all of the mutants carried single-point mutations within one specific target gene encoding the AfsR/SARP regulator (Table S8). The mutated regulator gene, a close homolog to the daunorubicin and doxorubicin biosynthesis and efflux master regulator DnrI in Streptomyces [47], locates next to genes of A. sulphurea that encode a homolog of the multidrug ABC transporter DrrAB, which is the daunorubicin efflux pump in Streptomyces peucetius [48].", "To test if an overexpression of the drrAB genes of A. sulphurea conferred CHD resistance to the A. sulphurea \u0394chdPKS \u0394chdAR double mutant, constructs for expression of either drrAB or chdR (under the control of strong promoters PactI and PermE*, respectively) or chdAR (under control of the native promoter) were generated and used for transformation of the double mutant. However, while transformants expressing chdR or chdAR showed resistance towards both CHD and CDCHD similar to A. sulphurea wild type [15,46], overexpression of drrAB did not lead to an increase in resistance, suggesting that drrAB genes alone are not sufficient to mediate resistance to chelocardins through efflux, and that the AfsR/SARP regulator of A. sulphurea might control further (yet unknown) genes involved in an alternative resistance-conferring route. In conclusion, ChdR was identified here as the primary efflux-based resistance determinant in the natural producer that accepts both CHD and CDCHD as substrates."]
