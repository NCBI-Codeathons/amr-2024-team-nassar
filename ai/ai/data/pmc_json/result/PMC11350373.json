["Results", "Impact of drug and target site modification of aminoglycosides on their antibacterial and antiphage activity", "Natural producers of secondary metabolites typically exhibit resistance to the antimicrobial molecules they synthesize (Hopwood 2007, Tenconi and Rigali 2018). This characteristic gains significance, particularly in the screening of small molecules for antiviral properties, as potential toxic effects on bacterial growth could mask any observed inhibition of phage infection. In a previous study, we showed the inhibition of phage infection for a broad range of aminoglycoside antibiotics by using strains resistant to the respective molecules (Kever et\u00a0al. 2022). In case of the used model aminoglycoside apramycin belonging to the subclass of aminoglycosides with mono-substituted 2-desoxystreptamin (2-DOS) ring (Krause et\u00a0al. 2016), this resistance mechanism relied on the acetylation of the 3\u2032 amino group of the 2-desoxystreptamin ring via aminoglycoside N(3)\u2010acetyltransferase AAC(3)-IVa (Magalhaes and Blanchard 2005) (Fig.\u00a01A). In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of diverse bacterial (self-) resistance mechanisms on the antiphage properties of different aminoglycoside antibiotics. Our goal was to discern whether the observed decoupling of antibacterial and antiphage properties through resistance mechanisms is a pervasive trait among different mechanisms found in bacterial genomes.", "Figure 1.Aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms via drug and target site modification do not interfere with the antiphage properties of structurally divergent aminoglycosides.

(2022), infection in absence of apramycin results in a complete culture collapse and a progressive phage amplification over time, whereas no more growth defect and increase in extracellular phage titer was detectable upon apramycin treatment for the virulent phage Alderaan infecting S. venezuelae (Fig.\u00a01B and\u00a0C).", "To investigate the antiphage properties of the unmodified compound, the 16S rRNA methyltransferase KamB encoded in the apramycin biosynthesis cluster of the natural producer S. tenebrarius was harnessed as an alternative resistance mechanism (Holmes et\u00a0al. 1991). This methyltransferase catalyses the N1\u2010methylation of the 16S rRNA at position A1408 conferring high-level resistance to the structurally divergent aminoglycosides apramycin, kanamycin, and tobramycin (Koscinski et\u00a0al. 2007) (Fig.\u00a01D). As observed for drug modification, target site modification abolished the antibacterial mode of apramycin, but simultaneously allowed a complete inhibition of phage infection to an almost identical extent as AAC(3)-IVa (Fig.\u00a01E and\u00a0F). The same applied to the other tested aminoglycosides tobramycin and gentamicin or kanamycin and tobramycin, which are also covered by the resistance spectrum of AAC(3)-IVa and KamB, respectively (Fig.\u00a01G, Figure S1). Although these compounds share the 2-desoxystreptamin (2-DOS) core structure with apramycin, they differ structurally in their substitutions and belong to the class of 4,6-disubstituted 2-DOS (Krause et\u00a0al. 2016).", "For resistance via acetyltransferase AAC(3)-IVa or methyltransferase KamB, analogous results concerning the influence of aminoglycosides were also obtained for infection of E. coli with the temperate phage \u03bb, which has previously been demonstrated to be sensitive toward apramycin and kanamycin treatment (Figure S2) (Kever et\u00a0al. 2022). Overall, this led us to the conclusion that acetylation neither positively nor negatively affects the antiphage activity of apramycin or tobramycin. Based on these findings, we infer that the inhibition of phage infection is most likely not due to a residual blockage of bacterial translation.", "Different aminoglycoside modifications do not interfere with the antiphage properties of the molecules", "To test whether this result is in fact of broad relevance, we tested different AMEs targeting different positions on the aminoglycoside scaffold. In case of apramycin, just two different AMEs are described in literature including the already used acetyltransferase AAC(3)-IVa and ApmA (Fig.\u00a02A). ApmA reveals a unique regiospecificity by acetylating apramycin at the N2\u2019 position of the octadiose element (Bordeleau et\u00a0al. 2021, Bordeleau et\u00a0al. 2023).", "Figure 2.Influence of different acetylation positions on the antiphage properties of apramycin.

(E) log10 fold change in PFU/ml during infection shown in (D). Assays shown in (D) and (E) were performed in biological triplicates.", "Since the apramycin resistance level mediated by the acetyltransferase ApmA was reported to be more than 8-fold lower than for AAC(3)-IVa (Bordeleau et\u00a0al. 2021), plaque assays offering higher resolution of the antiphage effect were used as a direct comparison of both modification positions. A gradual decrease in the number of plaques was detected upon increasing apramycin pressure independent of the underlying resistance gene (Fig.\u00a02B and\u00a0C). This was also in line with results gained during infection of E. coli with phage \u03bb. As with apramycin, different modifications of kanamycin via phosphotransferases APH(3\u2019)-Ia and APH(2\u2019\u2019)-IIa or the acetyltransferase AAC(6\u2019)-Ih did not interfere with the antiphage properties of this compound and caused a dose-dependent reduction in \u03bb\u00a0plaque formation. The same applied for modification of neomycin, an aminoglycoside with a 4,5-disubstituted 2-DOS, via APH(3\u2019)-Ia (Figure S2).", "To further verify the observed effects with a focus on apramycin effects on phage Alderaan infecting S. venezuelae, both acetyltransferases (AAC(3)-IVa and ApmA) were purified by affinity chromatography and used for in vitro modification of apramycin. Successful acetylation was confirmed by mass spectroscopy (Figure S3A). When supplementing acetylated apramycin to infection assays with the S. venezuelae wild type strain not resistant to the antibacterial effect of apramycin, no or just a slight effect on bacterial growth could be detected for AAC(3)-IVa- and ApmA-mediated acetylation, respectively. Under infection conditions, both acetylated versions severely impacted phage infection as indicated by an omitted cell lysis and a drop in titer after 24\u00a0h of infection (Fig.\u00a02D and\u00a0E). However, time-resolved quantification of phage titers revealed differences between the influence of intracellularly and extracellularly acetylated apramycin, which is likely caused by differences in uptake compared to the unmodified molecules. In case of AAC(3)-IVa-acetylated apramycin, phage titers rose in the early stages of infection before falling below the starting level, whereas ApmA-acetylated apramycin allowed no initial increase and a more pronounced decrease in titer of \u223c1000-fold after 24\u00a0h. (Figure S3B). The higher sensitivity of phage infection to ApmA-acetylated apramycin was also observed when the modified apramycin versions were added to spot assays with phage Alderaan and the S. venezuelae wildtype strain (Figure S3C). To conclude, together with the results presented in the previous sections, drug and target site modification were shown to efficiently abolish the antibacterial properties while retaining the antiphage properties.", "Dissecting the apramycin biosynthesis pathway reveals different intermediates with antiviral properties", "Our previous study about the antiphage properties of aminoglycosides revealed that the effect of the pure compound apramycin could be reproduced with spent medium of the natural apramycin producer S. tenebrarius (Kever et\u00a0al. 2022). To ascertain the role of apramycin as main antiphage molecule in the supernatant interfering with phage infection and to determine the position in the biosynthetic pathway at which antiphage properties appear, we tested spent media obtained from different S. tenebrarius mutant strains lacking different enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway (Lv et\u00a0al. 2016, Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021) (Fig.\u00a03A). To analyse the impact of these spent media on phage amplification, we harnessed the apramycin-resistant S. venezuelae strain encoding the 16S rRNA methyltransferase KamB to prevent further modification of the apramycin biosynthesis intermediates. Resistance via target site modification allowed complete inhibition of phage amplification by addition of S. tenebrarius wild type spent medium (Fig.\u00a03B).", "Figure 3.Influence of spent medium of different S. tenebrarius apramycin biosynthesis mutants on infection dynamics of phage Alderaan infecting S. venezuelae NRRL B-65442\u2013pIJ10257-kamB.

Supplementing of S. tenebrarius \u0394aprD4 spent medium to infection assays of the apramycin-resistant S. venezuelae strain carrying the methyltransferase KamB showed a similar extent of phage inhibition than the wild type spent medium. This could be traced back to the antiphage properties of oxyapramycin, as demonstrated by the addition of the purified intermediates to infection assays (Fig.\u00a03B and\u00a0C, Figure S4A). Contrary to this, deletion of aprU encoding an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and deletion of aprP encoding a putative creatinine amidohydrolase showed comparable amplification kinetics than the control infection without any supplementation, although slightly lower maximal phage titers were detected. This was in line with the successful phage infection upon addition of the acetylated demethylaprosamin and 7\u2019-N-acetylated apramycin shown to accumulate in the S. tenebrarius \u0394aprU and \u0394aprP mutant, respectively (Fig.\u00a03B and\u00a0C) (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021). However, comparing phage titers after 24\u00a0h of infection exposed a significant reduction in plaque-forming units upon addition of acetylated apramycin reaching almost the starting level, which could not be observed for the acetylated pseudotrisaccharide or paromamine (Figure S4A). Interestingly, a similar trend could be observed for the spent medium of the \u0394aprZ mutant lacking the extracellular alkaline phosphatase as final enzyme of the apramycin biosynthesis pathway (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021). Within the first 8\u00a0h, a similar extent of phage amplification was measured, but the decrease in titer after 24\u00a0h was substantially more pronounced dropping from \u223c4*109 PFU/ml at 8\u00a0h to \u223c2*107 PFU/ml at 24\u00a0h. This was accompanied by a less pronounced growth defect under infection conditions (Fig.\u00a03B and\u00a0C, Figure S4B). Accordingly, intracellular formation of phosphorylated apramycin appears to prevent autotoxicity by deactivating the antibacterial properties of the compound (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021), but at the same time provides some degree of protection against phage infection for the producer already during apramycin biosynthesis. Subsequent extracellular dephosphorylation activates the dual functionality of apramycin, which can be hypothesized to confer community-wide protection for resistant cells in the same ecological niche. Based on the results obtained for the different mutant strains defective in apramycin biosynthesis, we conclude that the antiphage properties of apramycin and its intermediates emerge after the 7-N\u2019-acetylated demethylaprosamine step, since no antiphage properties were observed for mutants lacking AprU or AprP.", "Cocultivation of S. venezuelae and S. tenebrarius confirms the antiphage impact of apramycin in the context of microbial communities", "To mimic community-wide antiphage defense more properly, phage-susceptible S. venezuelae NRRL B-65442\u2013pIJ10257-kamB was cocultured with apramycin-producing S. tenebrarius.

Furthermore, no negative effect of S. tenebarius mycelium and apramycin production on extracellular Alderaan phage particles was detected, further supporting the previously published hypothesis of interference with phage infection at an intracellular level (Fig.\u00a04A and\u00a0B) (Kever et\u00a0al. 2022). In contrast, continuous phage amplification and a complete culture collapse was observed in the presence of the S. tenebrarius \u0394aprQ mutant, altogether ruling out general issues in phage amplification due to the presence of other cocultured bacteria. (Fig.\u00a04C and\u00a0D). However, it is striking that no more cell growth was observed upon phage infection, even though Alderaan is not able to infect S. tenebrarius. This might be due to the release of as yet unidentified growth-inhibiting molecules or proteins, potentially accounting for the suppression of S. tenebrarius growth. In addition to showing the protective effect of S. tenebrarius against viral predation of S. venezuelae, these results highlight the need for a background level of apramycin already produced prior to phage attack."]
