["RESULTS", "AmiN provides tight substrate binding", "We report a unique bioscavenging kinase AmiN of Bacillus pumilus isolated from the oral microbiota of the Siberian bear (Ursus arctos collaris) by ultrahigh-throughput microfluidic droplet platform (11). Deep functional profiling of na\u00efve bear microbiome for antibiotic activity enabled single-cell screening of antibiotic producers and resistant bacteria (12). Unlike common antibiotic resistance kinases, the new AmiN has an outstanding catalytic efficiency kcat/KM = 3.4 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 108 M\u22121 s\u22121 that is close to the diffusion limit toward its natural substrate, amicoumacin (Ami) (Fig. 1). This extraordinary catalytic efficiency originates from the tight Ami binding, which is one of the strongest among the enzymes using low\u2013molecular weight substrates (13). The reaction rate follows the Michaelis-Menten kinetics at submicromolar Ami concentrations close to MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and displaying KM of 25 \u00b1 5.2 nM for Ami. These findings were in line with the observed Kd = 80 \u00b1 25 nM for Ami complexed with AmiN in the presence of nonhydrolyzable adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analog adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) (see table S1). We suggest that the exceptional specificity of AmiN toward Ami is mediated by the mechanism of its operation based on the Ami-driven closure of the active site and the existence of an additional substrate-binding loop forming unique \u03c0-box structure. The latter has not been reported for other antibiotic kinases.", "Fig. 1Reaction (top) and Michaelis-Menten kinetics (bottom) of Ami phosphorylation by AmiN.Reaction rates were determined in triplicate at saturating ATP\u2022Mg2+ concentrations, [ATP\u2022Mg2+] \u226b [Ami].

AmiN has numerous homologs in Bacilli (AmiN-like kinases) emphasizing its significance for its ecology and survival in the wild (12). AmiN and its homologs (hAmiN and YerI from Ami nonproducing B. pumilus and Bacillus subtilis, respectively) confer recombinant antibiotic resistance to Ami in bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, as well as in mammalian cells (see table S2). The alternative natural targets of AmiN-like kinases could include antibiotics of Bacilli, like cognate antibiotic zwittermicin (14) and paenilamicin (15) having structural similarity.", "A new kinase subfamily with unique structural features", "AmiN-like kinases are clustered in a distinct subfamily (32 to 98% identity) with low amino acid sequence identity (9 to 24% identity) in comparison with other characterized enzymes (Fig. 2, A and B). Multiple sequence alignment uncovered a number of amino acid residues like E36, N37, K/R52, H/R58, Brenner\u2019s motif (H200, D202, and N207), H204, metal chelation site (D219, D221, and D222), and R286 conserved in AmiN-like and related subfamilies (Fig. 2C). Amino acid residues K3, E41, R59, K111, E158-L/Q161, and F218 represent the hallmarks of AmiN-like enzymes. The most prominent feature of AmiN-like enzymes is the additional substrate-binding loop N238-E248 (fig. S1). Refined crystal structures of AmiN (Fig. 3 and fig.

S4). Other antibiotic kinases mediating the resistance toward aminoglycosides (PDB ID: 6fuc; identity: 12%; RMSD: 3.1 \u00c5) and macrolides (PDB ID: 5igh; identity: 13%; RMSD: 4.0 \u00c5) represent low sequence identity and structural similarity. AmiN kinase does not provide the resistance to aminoglycoside, macrolide, and tetracycline antibiotics (see table S4). AmiN shares a common protein kinase domain fold (Fig. 3); moreover, structurally similar protein kinase SrkA with an unidentified natural target phosphorylates myelin basic protein (MBP) in vitro (16). Therefore, to further understand the substrate specificity toward polypeptides, we studied phosphorylation of MBP and a combinatorial peptide library using radioactively labeled ATP (17). We identified that MBP and peptides P/I/R-S-W and Y-A-S mimicking an Ami sequence could be phosphorylated with AmiN (figs. S5 and S6). However, the protein kinase activity was more than two orders of magnitude lower in comparison with Ami (fig. S4).", "The exceptional kinetic characteristics of AmiN motivated us to define the key features of its functioning. There is a marked difference between the unliganded AmiN and liganded AmiN in complex with Mg2+, AMP-PNP, and Ami (Fig. 3A and fig. S2) arising from the closure of the AmiN active site. The AmiN closure is induced specifically by Ami rather than ATP (fig. S7) binding. The refined crystal structure of AmiN revealed common features with phosphotransferases\u2014ATP-binding domain, Brenner\u2019s phosphotransferase motif (H200-D202-N207), and metal-binding site (Fig. 3B). AmiN also has a special substrate-binding loop mentioned before, which forms a cavity\u2014\u03c0-box (complex \u03c0-stacking system organized by H204, H205, N238, W241, and Y242 amino acid residues) responsible for a high-affinity binding of Ami (Fig. 3C). The binding of Ami in the \u03c0-box itself is unable to induce AmiN closure, while it determines its outstanding specificity toward Ami-like molecules. Instead, AmiN closure is predetermined by stabilizing of an intramolecular network of interactions (fig. S8) between the N-terminal ATP-binding domain, substrate-binding domain, and the hydrophilic part of Ami (mostly the amine and terminal amide groups). This net is formed by H-bonds and charge interactions between NH3+Ami-E36-Q161-CONH2Ami (Fig. 3D) and Ami-D222D221-R58R59 residues (Fig. 3E) stabilizing AmiN closed structure. The AmiN closure results in Ami positioning and convergence of ATP with OHAmi residue and the formation of an oxyanion hole playing an active role in phosphotransfer (Fig. 3F). The specific amino acid residues essential for AmiN-based resistance that we associate with phosphotransfer (K52, D202, H204, N207, D219, D222, and R286) and AmiN closure (E36, R59, E159, Q161, and D221) were probed by a point mutagenesis (Fig. 3G and fig. S9). Single amino acid substitutions in the \u03c0-box do not lead to a complete loss of function, indicating the cooperativity in the complex \u03c0-stacking system.", "The mechanism of phosphotransfer is mediated by active site closure", "To clarify the mechanism underlying the AmiN functioning, we performed multiscale quantum mechanics (QM)/molecular mechanics (MM) simulations, which combine the precision of QM methods for the active center with the robustness of MM for the rest of the system (18). Molecular modeling revealed that AmiN in complex with ATP and Mg2+ exists in an open conformation, whereas a subsequent binding of Ami drives the enzyme active center closure (Fig. 4A). During this rearrangement (movie S1), the previously mentioned closure network (Fig. 3B) is formed. Positively charged N-terminal residues (the amino group of M1, H2, K3, and K6) also contribute to the process, specifically K3, which interacts with backbone oxygen at the C terminus of 270 to 290 alpha helix locking AmiN in the closed form (movie S1). Phosphorylation of Ami alters the conformational landscape in favor of open conformation, stimulating the product release. In line with this, kinetic and structural data demonstrated that Ca2+ ions, unlike Mg2+, abolished Ami phosphorylation (fig. S10), forming a stable complex with the open hAmiN form (fig. S11). The open hAmiN is stabilized by Ca2+-D221 chelation, inducing strong E36-R58 interaction; therefore, the oxyanion hole is not formed. Many different protein kinases are proposed to use two Mg2+ ions for optimal activity (19); however, at high Mg2+ concentrations, the product release becomes a rate-limiting step for them. Unlike these kinases, single Mg2+ is essential and sufficient for AmiN closure (Fig. 4A) and maximal activity (Fig. 5A), revealing ATP\u2022Mg2+ complex to be AmiN substrate (Fig. 5B).", "Fig. 4Multiscale modeling elucidated atomistic details of both closure dynamics and phosphotransfer reaction proceeding via dissociative mechanism.(A) Free energy surfaces (FES) indicate the Ami-induced AmiN closure and opening induced by the reaction products.

S11) stabilizes the enzyme-product complex in the closed conformation (Fig. 5C), resulting in the enzyme inhibition observed at the increased Mg2+ concentrations (Fig. 5A). Unlike the case of two metal ion-binding protein kinases, the excess of ATP did not inhibit AmiN (fig. S12), stressing that the second Mg2+ is not necessary for catalysis. Michaelis constant for ATP measured in the presence of saturating Ami KM = 0.14 \u00b1 0.02 mM (fig. S12) was similar to antibiotic kinases displaying KM in the 0.01 to 1.9 mM range (20), N-acetylhexosamine kinase KM = 0.17 mM (21), choline kinase KM = 0.35 to 0.41 mM (22), and protein kinases displaying KM in the 0.01 to 0.5 mM range (23).", "The QM/MM metadynamics indicated that the reaction proceeds through the dissociative mechanism (Fig. 4, B to E, and movie S1), and AmiN closure is essential for phosphotransfer (Fig. 5D). The estimated energetic barrier for open AmiN is substantially higher, indicating that the reaction rate in the closed form is more than eight orders of magnitude higher (Fig. 5D). At the first stage of the reaction, a gamma phosphate group is dissociated from the ATP molecule. A discrete stable intermediate state corresponds to the system with the dissociated metaphosphate anion and as yet the unactivated OHAmi nucleophile of the substrate (Fig. 4D). The metaphosphate is stabilized by H-bonding with H204, N207, and internal NHAmi amide and coordinated by Mg2+. At the second step of the reaction, OHAmi nucleophile is activated by proton transfer to D202, and P\u2500O bond is simultaneously formed. The D202 residue is stabilized in the appropriate conformation for the proton transfer via interactions with N207 and R286. In line with the previous observations, QM simulations stressed that single Mg2+ ion is sufficient for phosphotransfer, while the second Mg2+ ion does not affect the rate of the reaction (Fig. 5E).", "Metadynamics showed that phosphate transfer reaction is self-inhibited by the intramolecular Ami proton transfer from the positively charged NH3+Ami to the activated O-Ami reactive nucleophile of the substrate (see INH state on Fig. 4B and fig. S13A). The same NH3+Ami group is involved in proton exchange with the D222 amino acid residue (fig. S13B). The energetic barrier of 4.8 kcal/mol for the NH3+Ami-D222 proton transfer was low as compared with the reaction barrier, which indicates that D222 protects O\u2212Ami nucleophile, being the essential amino acid residue for the phosphotransfer. We suggest that it is a common feature of syn alkanolamine kinases facing intramolecular substrate proton transfer (Fig. 2C)."]
