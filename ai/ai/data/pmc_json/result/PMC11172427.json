["2. Results", "2.1. Results of Metabolites", "Metabolomics tests were performed on T1 and T2, and the quality control results showed that the proportion of substances with CV values of less than 0.5 in the T1 and T2 samples was higher than 85% (Figure 1A), indicating that the overall experimental data were stable. Repeated correlation assessment (Figure 1B) showed good reproducibility within the sample group and large differences between the groups. The PCA score plots of the T1 and T2 samples (Figure 1C) showed that the cumulative interpretation rate of the first two principal components was 75.3%. PC1 (61.3%) and PC2 (14%) could basically reflect the main characteristic information of all samples. The separation trend of the two groups of samples was obvious, indicating that the metabolite composition of the rice induced by pests had obviously changed. The prediction parameters of the OPLS-DA model (Figure 1D) were Q2 = 0.981 (p < 0.005) and R2Y = 1 (p < 0.005), indicating the best mode.", "Metabolites with statistically significant differences were screened based on OPLS-DA analysis, with fold change \u2265 2, fold change \u2264 0.5, and VIP \u2265 1 as conditions. As shown in the volcano plot (Figure 2A), 398 differential metabolites were obtained. Compared with the T2 group, 354 metabolites in T1 were significantly up-regulated, 44 compounds were significantly down-regulated, and the overall metabolite content showed an up-regulated trend. The cluster analysis of differential metabolites (Figure 2B) showed that lipids (28.64%), alkaloids (13.57%), and phenolic acids (17.84%) accounted for a large proportion of the differential metabolites. The content of flavonoids was mostly down-regulated, and a small part was up-regulated. Amino acids and their derivatives, organic acids, nucleotides and their derivatives, lignans, coumarins, and terpenes, with relatively low proportions, were mostly up-regulated.", "The KEGG enrichment diagram (Figure 3A) shows that 398 different metabolites were enriched in 79 metabolic pathways, and the enrichment degree was greater when the Rich factor was higher, and the lower the p-value, the more significant the enrichment. Among them, 14 metabolic pathways were highly enriched (p-value < 0.5). These included linoleic acid metabolism, terpene, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, \u03b1-linolenic acid metabolism, and so on. Among them, the top 20 metabolic pathways with the highest abundance tended toward a score of 1 in combination with the analysis of the differential abundance score (Figure 3B), indicating that the expressions of differential metabolites in T1 show an overall up-regulated trend compared with T2 (the more the DA score tends to be 1, the more the overall expression of the pathway tends to be up-regulated; the more it moves to \u22121, the lower it is). It was found that metabolic pathways with significantly up-regulated metabolites (p-value < 0.1) were linoleic acid metabolism, terpene, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, \u03b1-linolenic acid metabolism, lysine degradation, tryptophan metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism, which may be important metabolic pathways for insect resistance in rice.", "After feeding, 71 kinds of alkaloid metabolites in rice were significantly changed (Figure 4), among which 70 metabolites were up-regulated and 1 metabolite was down-regulated. Phenolamines were the most abundant among them including 29 kinds, which suggests that phenolamines may be involved in the resistance of rice to these insects. Finally, we screened six phenolamines that were significantly up-regulated differential metabolites\u2014N-trans-feruloyl-3-methoxytyramine (1), N-trans-feruloyltyramine (2), N-trans-p-coumaroyltyramine (3), N-cis-feruloyltyramine (4), N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine (5), and benzamide (6)\u2014and anti-insect activities of these six compounds (Figure 5) were determined.", "2.2. Results of Insecticidal Activity", "The results show that at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/g, compound 1 (Figure 6) could significantly inhibit the growth of Chilo suppressalis at 3, 6, and 9 days, and the inhibitory rate was the highest in the first 3 days, reaching 59.63%, and then decreased and stabilized at 42%. At a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/g, compounds 2\u20134 showed better anti-insect activity. Compounds 5\u20136 had no significant effect on the growth of Chilo suppressalis.", "2.3. Contents of Compound 1 in Different Treatments of Rice", "The concentration and peak area of compound 1 were used as the horizontal coordinate (X) and the vertical coordinate (Y), respectively. The standard curve of compound 1 was drawn (Figure 7), and the regression equation was obtained.\nY=45404.2X+40.1898\u00a0r2=0.999", "The contents of compound 1 in T1 and T2 were 8.55 ng/g and 0.53 ng/g, respectively. As shown in Figure 8, the content of compound 1 in T1 was significantly higher than that in T2, indicating the pest-induced synthesis of compound 1, and improved the resistance of rice to Chilo suppressalis.", "2.4. Effects of Compound 1 on Detoxification Enzyme Activities", "The enzyme activity assay showed that larval exposure to compound 1 significantly reduced the activities of GST, and the inhibition ratio was 41% (Figure 9A). The UGT (Figure 9B) and CarE (Figure 9C) activities showed no significant differences between the RT and CK groups.", "2.5. Results of Transcriptome Sequencing", "2.5.1. Quality of Transcriptome Sequencing", "Chilo suppressalis was fed an artificial diet containing 100 \u03bcg/g of compound 1 for 9 days as the treatment group (RT) and an artificial diet containing an equal volume of DMSO for 9 days as the control group (CK). RNA-Seq analysis was performed for the two groups. The raw reads were 22633197, 23337632, 22768375, 24100758, 23487995, and 21570901, respectively. The clean bases after filtering low-quality sequences were 21769138, 22542267, 21925915, 23138018, 22675237, and 20795171. The subsequent analysis was based on clean bases for high-quality data analysis.", "The error rate of the clean data obtained from the quality summary of the sequencing data (Table 1) was 0.03%, which met the standard. The bases with Phred values greater than 20 and 30 accounted for 97.34\u201397.63% and 92.3\u201392.91% of the total bases, respectively, indicating that the data quality was strictly controlled, the overall quality was good, and the GC content was about 42%, which belonged to the normal range.", "2.5.2. Quality of Transcripts", "As clean reads need to be spliced for transcriptomes without reference genomes, three independent software modules of Trinity (v2.6.6), namely, Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly, were used, therefore, to splice all clean reads and obtain preliminary transcripts. Then, redundant transcripts were aggregated by the Corset hierarchical clustering of the transcripts, so that the transcripts with expression differences between the samples were separated from the original cluster, and new clusters were established. Each cluster was defined as \u201cGene\u201d. The stitching quality was evaluated by using BUSCOs (benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs), with high accuracy and integrity, as shown in Figure 10.", "2.5.3. Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes between CK Group and RT Group", "The results of the repeated correlation assessment between the CK group and RT group (Figure 11A) showed good reproducibility within the sample group and large differences between the groups. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened with padj < 0.05 and |log2(foldchange)| > 1 as conditions. The DEGs had statistically significant expression levels. The results are shown in the volcano plot (Figure 11B). A total of 5219 DEG were detected, among which 3623 genes in the RT group were up-regulated (red dots), 1596 genes were down-regulated (green dots), and 42,657 genes were not significantly co-expressed (blue dots) compared with the CK group. The DEG expression showed an overall up-regulated trend.", "2.5.4. Functional Annotation and Enrichment Analysis of DEGs", "Goseq was used for the GO enrichment analysis. The GO database divides gene functions into three categories: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), or molecular function (MF). The significant enrichment analysis with the GO function (padj < 0.05) showed that biological functions were significantly correlated with the DEGs. The results show (Figure 12A) that the differentially expressed genes of the CK group and the RT group were annotated as MF, BP, and CC, and more of them were annotated as BP and MF.", "In the RT group, the up-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in the cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process, ATPase activity, biosynthetic process, intracellular interaction, organelle, chromosome, and phosphatase activity terms (Figure 12B). The down-regulated DEGs in the RT group were only significantly enriched in the oxidoreductase activity term related to energy metabolism (Figure 12C).", "According to the KEGG pathway analysis, the significantly up-regulated genes were mainly enriched in the ribosome, ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, cell cycle, DNA replication, proteasome, mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and other pathways (Figure 13A). All these pathways are involved in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation.", "The significantly down-regulated genes were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), thermogenesis, carbon metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, drug metabolism\u2014cytochrome P450, and other pathways (Figure 13B). These pathways are mainly related to energy metabolism.", "2.6. Verification by RT-qPCR", "Thirty-three differentially expressed genes were randomly selected and verified by RT-qPCR, including eighteen up-regulated and fifteen down-regulated differential genes. The 18 up-regulated differentially expressed genes belonged to the biosynthetic, cell cycle, DNA replication, and metabolic pathways of eukaryotic ribosomes. The 15 down-regulated differential genes belonged to metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism pathway. In the significantly up-regulated genes (Figure 14A), only REXO1 and MCM3 could be detected in the CK group, while the other target genes were only detected in the RT group, and these genes were significantly up-regulated in the RT group. In the down-regulated genes (Figure 14B), the gene expression levels in the RT group were significantly lower than those in the CK group, which was consistent with the transcriptome sequencing results. The up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways related to cell proliferation, and the down-regulated genes were significantly enriched in the pathways related to material and energy metabolism. The results confirm that compound 1 disrupted the normal growth and development of Chilo suppressalis larvae by promoting abnormal cell proliferation, inhibiting metabolism and energy supply, and inhibiting the growth of the larvae."]
