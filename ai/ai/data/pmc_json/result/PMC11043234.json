["Results", "Doxorubicin resistance screening", "S. peucetius SIPI-14, which has significantly increased doxorubicin levels, was generated by traditional mutagenesis in our study (Wang et al. 2018). Due to its strong cytotoxicity, doxorubicin has a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of S. peucetius strains themselves. In this study, doxorubicin was added to the seed medium to obtain strains with greater doxorubicin resistance through continuous resistance pressure screening. Initially, 50\u00a0mg/L doxorubicin was added to the liquid medium. After continuous cultivation, the concentration of doxorubicin in the seed medium was gradually increased from 50\u00a0mg/L to 150\u00a0mg/L to screen for high-yielding strains that could grow in a resistant environment (Fig.\u00a01a). Through continuous doxorubicin resistance screening, the biomass of the strains gradually increased from 12.5 to 14.8%, and the ability to produce doxorubicin was significantly enhanced. The high-yielding strain SIPI-7-14 was selected from seed medium containing 150\u00a0mg/L doxorubicin. The yield of doxorubicin reached 847\u00a0mg/L, which was 51.7% greater than that of SIPI-14 (Fig.\u00a01b).", "Fig. 1Improvement of doxorubicin yield by resistance screening a Fifty milligrams/L doxorubicin was added to the seed medium for 2 days of culture, after which 10% of the inoculum was transferred to fresh seed medium 2 times.

Therefore, genetic engineering was selected for strain modification. After producing daunorubicin and doxorubicin, the strains could also produce byproducts. According to the branch biosynthetic pathway of doxorubicin shown in Additional file: Fig. S1, the dnrU gene in the branch metabolic pathway encodes a ketoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of the intermediate daunorubicin at position C-13 to form 13-dihydrodaunorubicin. The genes dnrH and dnrX encode enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of baumycin-like glycosides from daunorubicin and doxorubicin. In this study, homologous double-crossover recombination was used to knock out the 351\u00a0bp fragment of dnrU (Fig.\u00a02a) to obtain the \u0394U1 mutant. The parent strain SIPI-7-14 and the \u0394U1 mutant were confirmed by PCR (Fig.\u00a02b). \u25b3H4 and \u25b3X1 were obtained using the same method by deleting dnrH and dnrX (Fig.\u00a02d and e), respectively. The biomass of the engineered strain \u25b3U1 decreased slightly compared to that of the parental strain SIPI-7-14, from 15 to 14%. However, the yield of doxorubicin produced by the engineered strain \u25b3U1 was 1005\u00a0mg/L, which was 21.5% greater than that produced by the parental strain. However, when the branch pathway genes dnrH and dnrX were knocked out, the yield of doxorubicin in the knockout strains \u25b3H4 and \u25b3X1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02c).", "Fig. 2Inactivation of competing pathway genes and overexpression of the resistance genes a Schematic representation of the disruption of the target gene dnrU in S. peucetius. b The parental strain SIPI-7-14 and the engineered strain \u25b3U1 were verified by PCR.

In contrast to the ATP-dependent efflux pump mechanism composed of drrA and drrB (Kaur 1997; Li et al. 2014), the drrC gene encodes a UvrA-like protein that binds to DNA and can remove daunorubicin from the insertion site, thus enabling actinomycetes to tolerate their own products (Lomovskaya et al. 1996; Prija and Prasad 2017). The integrated plasmid pSET152 was used to overexpress the drrC, drrAB and drrD genes in the strain \u25b3U1 to obtain the engineered strains \u25b3U1/drrC, \u25b3U1/drrAB and \u25b3U1/drrD, respectively. The engineered strains were verified by shake flask fermentation. The doxorubicin yield of the engineered strain \u25b3U1/drrC was 13.2% greater than that of the parental strain \u25b3U1, reaching 1128\u00a0mg/L (Fig.\u00a02f). The engineered strain \u25b3U1/drrAB produced 1098\u00a0mg/L doxorubicin. However, the engineered strain \u25b3U1/drrD produced 1010\u00a0mg/L doxorubicin in a shake flask, which was almost the same as that of the parental strain. Furthermore, the drrAB and drrC genes were overexpressed in the \u25b3U1 strain to obtain the engineered strain \u25b3U1/drrABC. However, the combined overexpression of the drrAB and drrC genes resulted in a lower fermentation yield than the single expression of drrC. In conclusion, the engineered strain \u25b3U1/drrC produced the highest fermentation yield in shake flasks. The transcription levels of the drrC gene in the engineered strain \u25b3U1/drrC and the parental strain \u25b3U1 were subsequently analyzed. The transcription level of drrC in \u25b3U1 decreased significantly during the culture process. The transcription level of drrC in the strain \u25b3U1/drrC was significantly greater than that in the \u25b3U1 strain (Fig.\u00a02g). A high level of drrC expression increases the tolerance of the strain to high concentrations of doxorubicin, resulting in maintenance of the biomass and the production of additional products.", "Fermentation medium optimization by RSM", "In our previous studies, Wang (Wang et al. 2018) found that maltodextrin and dry yeast powder had a positive effect on doxorubicin by using single-factor experiments. In addition to maltodextrin and dry yeast powder, we also found that calcium salts affect the synthesis of doxorubicin. The effects of four different calcium sources, calcium pantothenate, Ca(NO3)2, CaSO4 and CaCl2, on the yield of doxorubicin fermentation were studied, and CaCl2 was shown to improve the production of doxorubicin (Fig.\u00a03g). Therefore, S. peucetius \u25b3U1/drrC cultured in fermentation media supplemented with different concentrations of CaCl2 were investigated in shake flasks. When the concentration of CaCl2 was 0.6%, the yield of doxorubicin increased by 11.3%, reaching 1228\u00a0mg/L (Fig.\u00a03h). The components containing maltodextrin, yeast powder and calcium chloride were further optimized by the response surface method.", "For the response surface optimization experiment, a total of 17 formulations were designed (as shown in Additional file: Table S3), each with three parallel shake flasks. The center points were the same for 5 points and different for the remaining 12 points. Doxorubicin yields ranging from 921 to 1333\u00a0mg/L were observed in 17 experiments with three factors and three levels (Additional file: Table S3). The response of doxorubicin content was expressed by a second-order polynomial equation, which was obtained by multiple regression analysis (R2\u2009=\u20090.9548 and p\u2009<\u20090.0006):", "Here, Y represents the doxorubicin yield. A, B and C represent maltodextrin, dry yeast powder and CaCl2, respectively. ANOVA was used in the response surface model to verify the reliability of the statistical model and the statistical significance of the parameters, as described in Additional file: Table S4. The p value of the second-order PRS model is 0.0006, indicating that this model is significant. In addition, lack of fit was used to evaluate model reliability, and a nonsignificant lack of fit was satisfactory. In this model, the lack of fit F value is 0.69, which is insignificant relative to the pure error, indicating that the model is suitable. The predicted R2 is predicted by the response surface model.

On the 6th day, the yield of doxorubicin reached 1340\u00a0mg/L (Fig.\u00a04c), which was very close to the model-predicted value of 1323\u00a0mg/L, indicating that the prediction model was effective. The optimized formulation was more suitable for the growth of \u25b3U1/drrC; Thus, having more biomass resulted in a greater doxorubicin yield (Fig.\u00a04b). In addition, the pH of the optimized formulation was maintained between 6.4 and 6.6, which was lower than that of the original formulation, indicating that the strain underwent a slower aging reaction in the new medium than in the other media, thereby increasing the fermentation period (Fig.\u00a04a).", "Batch culture of \u25b3U1/drrC in 10\u00a0L fermenter for doxorubicin production", "To further expand the scale of cultivation, fermentation was carried out in a 10\u00a0L fermenter using the original and optimized media with S. peucetius \u25b3U1/drrC (Fig.\u00a04d and e).

The trend of the pH change in the optimized formulation was consistent with that in the original formulation, but the pH was maintained at approximately 6.4 during the later period, which was lower than that of the original formulation. The duration of doxorubicin production in the optimized formulation was longer, probably because the biomass in the optimized formulation was maintained for a longer time, and a lower pH was more favorable for strain production.
