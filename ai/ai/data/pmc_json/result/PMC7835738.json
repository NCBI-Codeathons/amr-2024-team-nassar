["2. Results", "The nucleoside-analog inhibitor PUM represents a highly hydrophilic compound. First, the experimental setup for detection of PUM was tested. Therefore, the reported wild-type producer strain Streptomyces sp. DSM26212 was cultivated in production medium (PM medium) for 5 days. The fermentation broth was cleared by centrifugation as well as filtration and PUM was enriched by strong cation-exchange chromatography, as previously described [1]. Subsequent high-resolution liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) analysis revealed the presence of PUM, ionizing as [M + H]+ ion in the enriched fraction. The identity of this ion could be corroborated by MS/MS fragmentation pattern analysis. A plausible decay mechanism yielding the observed fragments was proposed and fragments observed in the experiment could be matched (Figure 1).", "To generate a heterologous expression platform for PUM production, a streamlined assembly of the BGC was envisaged, meaning only genes involved in the biosynthesis should be cloned and it was planned to assemble the genes in a way that all face the same direction. However, to avoid autotoxicity, the genes pumB and pumL, encoding major facilitator superfamily (MFS)-type transporters, which might be essential for self-resistance, should be incorporated into all expression constructs. As a first construct, the previously identified genes to which a function in PUM biosynthesis was assigned (by experimental proof and, in some cases, putatively based on sequence similarity) were amplified from the natural producer strain Streptomyces sp. DSM26212 and were cloned into the E. coli/Streptomyces shuttle vector pCAP03. Hence, the genes pumB, D, G, E, I\u2013M were assembled in the shuttle vector and the resulting construct pCAP03-PUM\u0394F\u0394H was outfitted either with the constitutive Streptomyces ermE* promotor, or the inducible tcp830 promoter by \u03bbRED recombination, whereby the latter has a lower expression strength than ermE* (Figure 2). Subsequently, these constructs were transferred into S. coelicolor M1146 [11] by conjugation. Fermentation was performed in complex medium, i.e., in International Streptomyces Project medium 2 (ISP2) and tryptic soy broth (TSB). Thereby, the cultures carrying the tcp830 promoter were induced by addition of anhydrotetracycline (2 mg/L) to the cultures after one day of growth. PUM production was analyzed after 3 and 5 days of fermentation by UHPLC\u2013MS using the cleared culture broth. S. coelicolor M1146-pCAP03 (empty vector) served as negative control. However, heterologous expression using the construct pCAP03-PUM\u0394F\u0394H (see Figure 2, version I) did not result in detectable PUM production at all. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a lack of correctly phosphorylated uridine precursors prevents detectable PUM production. To verify this assumption, the adenylate kinase encoding pumH, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of a uridine-based substrate, was added to the construct, resulting in pCAP03-PUM\u0394F (Figure 2, version II). Heterologous expression using the latter construct enabled detection of minor traces of an ion corresponding to the calculated mass/charge ratio of the PUM [M + H]+ adduct. Such an ion was not present in the negative control. This result pointed towards the fact that this could be regarded as the minimal gene set necessary for production of PUM. However, it was questionable whether this very low expression yield justifies this as the minimal BGC.", "It was next determined whether a further gene is essential to enable a valid PUM biosynthesis. A promising candidate was pumF, which is located right in the middle of the BGC. BLASTp of the translated nucleotide sequence revealed homology to the mur33-encoded protein (77% query coverage; 43% identity) in the BGC coding for muraymycin C1\u2014the latter another nucleoside natural product. BLASTp search of pumF and mur33 showed homology (48% and 50%) to predicted serine/threonine protein kinases of Actinomycetes. Based on these observations, the pumF gene was incorporated into the expression construct pCAP03-PUM (Figure 2, version III). Fermentation of an heterologous host carrying the expression construct pCAP03-PUM_ermE*, in which the PUM genes are under control of the ermE* promotor, in ISP2 medium led to detection of a low intensity ion with m/z 487.1856 after 5 days incubation time. This matched the PUM sum formula of C17H26N8O9 [M + H]+ (8 ppm error) and retention time, and this ion was absent in the empty vector control. Prolonged incubation (20 days) of the strain led to accumulation of this ion and allowed more accurate detection with m/z 487.1896 (0 ppm error) (Figure 3). Furthermore, targeted MS/MS fragmentation of this ion revealed the presence of the characteristic signature ion of m/z 244.0920, which is indicative for the APU fragment (3 ppm error). Thus, the identity of the molecule as PUM was verified and the (indirect) involvement of PumF in PUM biosynthesis was shown. However, no ions corresponding to PUM could be detected in cultures grown in TSB medium and in strains that were harboring the expression constructs in which the streamlined BGC was under the control of the tcp830 promotor."]
