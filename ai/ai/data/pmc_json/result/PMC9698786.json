["2. Results and Discussion", "2.1. Overall Results", "Results from all three of our analyses failed to provide strong evidence to support the simple hypothesis that adaptive resistance results from convergent reductions or shifts in polar contacts within and among lineages. In fact, two approaches that maintained rigid amino acid sidechains (VINA-R and GNINA-R) suggested that polar contacts increased as correlates of increased TTX resistance in snakes and salamanders. The inclusion of flexible sidechains coupled with a more computationally intensive analyses (GNINA-F) did suggest that total number of polar contacts in super-TTX-resistant snake and salamander channels were reduced relative to their TTX-sensitive relatives, but polar contact loss was not convergent and did not occur at the same amino acid positions in these lineages. Data from estimates of binding energies within and among TTX-resistant lineages also failed to generate any pattern that was consistent with functional convergence associated with homologous substitutions.", "2.2. Polar Contact Number", "Analyses of TTX-sensitive channels provide a baseline estimate for the number of polar contacts between TTX and channels. However, we observed dramatic variation across models and lineages for TTX-sensitive channels (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4). For example, VINA-R predicted a docked position for TTX that forms six polar contacts with the TTX-sensitive mammalian channel (rNaV1.4), while the GNINA-R model forms four and the GNINA-F model forms seven (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 4). Similarly, the TTX-sensitive snake channel (TsNaV1.4IL) forms five (VINA-R), four (GNINA-R), and eight (GNINA-F) polar contacts with docked TTX (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3). Interestingly, the TTX-sensitive salamander channel (AmNaV1.4) was predicted to form fewer contacts with models that included rigid sidechains: three (VINA-R) and four (GNINA-R), but an increased number (10) for the model that incorporated flexible sidechains (GNINA-F).", "Consistent with our simple model of convergent evolution of TTX resistance among lineages, we would expect to see parallel reductions in polar contacts in our known \u201csuper-resistant\u201d channels (snake TsNaV1.4WC and salamander TgNaV1.4), but our results do not support this outcome. In fact, models that did not incorporate flexible amino acid sidechains (VINA-R and GNINA-R) actually predicted greater numbers of polar contacts between TTX and the TTX binding site (Figure 1 and Figure 2). For example, the VINA-R model forms six polar contacts with TsNaV1.4WC compared to five with the sensitive TsNaV1.4IL, and the same analysis estimated five polar contacts with TgNaV1.4 and three with the sensitive salamander channel AmNaV1.4 (Figure 1). Models that incorporated flexible sidechains (GNINA-F) did provide limited evidence that polar contact formation was reduced in \u201csuper-resistant\u201d snake and newt channels (Figure 3). This analysis predicted bound TTX positions that form 8 and 10 polar contacts with sensitive snake (TsNaV1.4IL) and sensitive salamander (AmNaV1.4), respectively, and a reduced number for \u201csuper-resistant\u201d snake (7; TsNaV1.4WC) and salamander (6; TgNaV1.4). Interestingly, this downward trend results from increases in estimated polar contacts for the sensitive channels in both lineages. Finally, the octopus channel (HlNaV1), which shares similar substitutions with both TsNaV1.4WC and TgNaV1.4, was predicted to form more polar contacts with TTX in the fixed sidechain analyses (8, VINA-R and 10, GNINA-R) and fewer in the flexible sidechain analysis (6, GNINA-F; Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 4).", "Polar contact predictions for intermediate TTX-resistant snake and salamander channels (TsNaV1.4BN, snake; TshanNaV1.4 and SsNaV1.4, salamander) provide no support for our hypothesis (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3). Polar contact estimates for these channels ranged from a low of 2 (TshanNaV1.4, VINA-R) to a high of 11 (TshanNaV1.4, GNINA-F). Even when compared within lineages and within different models, our intermediate channels did not form intermediate numbers of polar contacts (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3). In snakes, TsNaV1.4BN had either the same or a higher number of polar contacts compared to the sensitive TsNaV1.4IL for all analyses, and the same general pattern was true for both of the intermediate salamander channels (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3), though TshanNaV1.4 (VINA-R) and SsNaV1.4 (GNINA-F) form one less in individual analyses.", "2.3. Polar Contact Position Shifts", "Our results provide little evidence that convergent changes in polar contact position underlie the evolution of adaptive resistance to TTX in snake, salamander, and octopus channels. Although results from our analyses provide some support that TTX resistance is associated with shifts in the position of polar contacts, they do not generate a clear pattern of polar contact shifts among \u201csuper-resistant\u201d channels that suggest the changes are similar across lineages (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4). For snakes (TsNaV1.4IL, TsNaV1.4BN, and TsNaV1.4WC), data from the GNINA analyses (GNINA-R and F) suggest that resistance in TsNaV1.4WC results from a loss of polar contacts with amino acids in domain I and II and an increase in polar contacts with amino acids in domain III and IV, but these shifts are not supported by VINA-R and we see no equivalent pattern in salamanders (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4).", "Our results predict that the TTX-sensitive snake (TsNaV1.4IL) and mammal (rNaV1.4) channels form polar contacts between TTX and amino acids in the selectivity filter as well as backbone atoms from residues in domain III (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3) and are consistent with current understanding of the interaction between TTX and TTX-sensitive VGSCs [41,42]. Additionally, data from the VINA-R and GNINA-F analyses predict that TTX-sensitive snake (TsNaV1.4IL) and rat (rNaV1.4) channels form polar contacts with TTX at amino acid position in the outer negatively charged ring (Figure 1, Figure 3 and Figure 4). These results are also consistent with general models of TTX-channel interactions [41,42]. Notably, all of the TTX-sensitive snake channel docking models from all analyses form polar contacts with TTX and an aspartic acid in the domain I portion of the selectivity filter (D396, Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3). Additionally, the majority (two of three) of the channel docking models form a polar contact with TTX at the glutamic acid in the domain II portion of the selectivity filter (E798, Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3). Polar contact formation between TTX and the two negatively charged amino acids (D396 and E798) in the selectivity filter may be an important component of channel block, because the selectivity filter is the narrowest portion of the open pore and these negatively charged amino acids may coordinate sodium ion movement through the pore [41,43].", "Data from TTX-resistant snake channels suggest that amino acid substitutions linked to reduced TTX block alter the position of polar contacts between TTX and amino acids in the TTX binding site (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4). Data from the GNINA-F analysis predicted that the TTX-sensitive snake channel (TsNaV1.4IL) forms polar contacts between TTX and both negatively charged amino acids in the selectivity filter (D396 and E798, Figure 3). In the moderately resistant snake (TsNaV1.4BN) channel, polar contacts are altered and the channel only forms a contact with one of these two amino acids, the glutamic acid in domain II (E798, Figure 3). The polar contacts are altered again in the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d snake channel (TsNaV1.4WC) and no polar contacts are formed between TTX and the channel at these two positions (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Instead, TsNaV1.4WC forms contacts with amino acids in the outer negatively charged ring in domain II and IV, as well as the same set of amino acids in domain III as other snake channels. Data from the GNINA-R analysis predicted a similar shift in polar contacts (Figure 2). The TTX-sensitive snake channel (TsNaV1.4IL) forms a polar contact with TTX at the aspartic acid in the selectivity filter (D396). However, neither the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d or moderately resistant snake channels (TsNaV1.4WC and TsNaV1.4BN) form polar contacts between TTX and the negatively charged amino acids in the selectivity filter.", "In contrast, data from the GNINA analyses (GNINA-F and GNINA-R) do not provide a clear a pattern of polar contact shifts for channels in the salamander lineage (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4). Data from the GNINA-F analysis predicted that all channels in this lineage form contacts with either the negatively charged amino acid in the domain I or domain II portion of the selectivity filter (Figure 3). Additionally, a separate analysis of TTX docking with the GNINA-F tool predicted that the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d salamander channel (TgNaV1.4) would form polar contacts with TTX at both negatively charged amino acids in the selectivity filter (D167 and E570, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Data from the GNINA-R analysis of channels in the salamander lineage did not predict polar contact shifts away from the negatively charged amino acids in the selectivity filter of the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d salamander channel (TgNaV1.4, Figure 2). TTX-sensitive channels and moderately resistant salamander channels were not predicted to form polar contacts between TTX and the two negatively charged amino acids in the selectivity filter, and the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d salamander channel was predicted to form a polar contact with the aspartic acid in the domain I portion of the selectivity filter (D167, Figure 2).", "The blue-ringed octopus (HlNaV1) channel shares amino acid substitutions at multiple positions with both \u201csuper-resistant\u201d snake and salamander channels. Data from the GNINA-F analysis predicted that these substitutions would change the pattern of polar contacts in a similar way to the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d snake channel; however, data from other analyses did not follow this pattern (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 4). The toxin in the position predicted by GNINA-F analysis did not form polar contacts with the octopus channel (HlNaV1) at either of the two negatively charged amino acids in the selectivity filter (D363 and E933, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Instead, the channel formed polar contacts with TTX at two amino acids in the outer negatively charged ring, in domain I (E366) and domain III (T1406). In contrast, data from the rigid channel analysis (VINA-R and GNINA-R) predicted that the octopus channel would form a polar contact with the glutamic acid in the domain II position of the selectivity filter (E933, Figure 1 and Figure 2).", "The lack of convergent patterns in our data could be the result of fundamentally different structure\u2013function relationships in snake, salamander, and octopus channels. For example, TTX\u2013channel interactions are governed by complex state-dependent factors (e.g., use-dependent block) that are associated with conformational changes as the channel opens. Differences in key residues across snake, salamander, and octopus channels might also modulate these conformational changes and modify the formation of polar contacts between TTX and channels. However, little is known about these processes in non-mammalian channels and our data cannot address this directly. Though our data may not fully capture alterations in channel conformation, data from docking TTX in the TTX-sensitive mammalian channel (rNaV1.4) suggest that our analyses capture some of the important components of channel block (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 4). The data from all three analyses broadly agree with current understanding of the interaction between TTX and TTX-sensitive VGSCs [41,42]. In all of our data, TTX binding with rNaV1.4 is coordinated across the pore with the guanidine group on TTX forming a polar contact with the aspartic acid in the domain I portion of the selectivity filter (D400) and other portions of the toxin forming polar contacts with backbone amines in domain III (F1236 and G1238). Additionally, in the VINA-R and GNINA-F analyses, rNaV1.4 forms polar contacts with TTX at amino acid positions in the outer negatively charged ring (E403, VINA-R and E403 and E758, GNINA-F). Taken together, these results suggest that our models are generating appropriate interactions between TTX and VGSCs and could capture shared patterns of polar contact shifts between the snake and salamander lineages.", "2.4. Binding Affinity and CNN Scoring of TTX Poses", "The VINA and GNINA tools use different mechanisms for assessing ligand-channel interactions including ligand binding affinity scores. The VINA tool uses an empirical scoring function based on structural data to calculate the binding affinity of ligands docked in receptors [44]. The GNINA tool uses a form of machine learning to compare and score ligand poses [45]. The GNINA tool calculates a binding affinity score for docked ligands along with a score that evaluates the pose of the ligand, the convolutional neural network (CNN) score. Binding affinity scores from the VINA-R tool used in this analysis suggest that TTX does not bind as well to \u201csuper-resistant\u201d snake and salamander channels (Figure 1); however, none of the binding affinity scores from the GNINA tool (GNINA-R and GNINA-F) distinguish between the channels in this analysis (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4). Instead, the CNN scores for the docked ligands from the GNINA analysis provide some evidence that the flexible sidechain analysis (GNINA-F) may provide better predictions of the position of TTX bound in the channels.", "Comparisons of binding energy values based on binding affinity predictions from the VINA tool failed to differentiate between moderate and TTX-sensitive channels, but for known \u201csuper-resistant\u201d channels (salamander TgNaV1.4 and snake TsNaV1.4), this value was a good predictor of TTX resistance (Figure 1). Estimated binding energy values for rat (rNaV1.4) and TTX-sensitive snake (TsNaV1.4IL) channel were similar \u22126.8 kcal/mol and \u22126.6 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 1). The binding energy estimate for the moderately resistant snake channel (TsNaV1.4BN) was slightly more negative than either of these estimates at \u22126.9 kcal/mol. We estimated reduced binding affinity (\u22126.2 kcal/mol) for the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d snake channel (TsNaV1.4WC). Binding energy values for TTX-sensitive and moderately resistant salamander channels were similar to the binding affinity estimates for TTX-sensitive snake channels: \u22126.5 to \u22126.7 kcal/mol. By contrast, the binding energy for the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d salamander channel (TgNaV1.4) was severely reduced at \u22124.5 kcal/mol. Finally, we estimated a binding energy for the octopus channel (HlNaV1) of \u22126.8 kcal/mol. This value is comparable to the value estimated for the rat channel. These results suggest that the two homologous amino acid substitutions in domain IV that snakes, newts, and octopuses share do not change the interaction of TTX with the channels in the same way. For the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d snake (TsNaV1.4WC) and salamander (TgNaV1.4) channels, we estimated reduced binding affinity between TTX and the channels. However, though we identified changes in the pattern of polar contacts between the octopus channel and TTX compared to other channels, this pattern did not reduce the binding affinity values we calculated for the interaction (Figure 1).", "In contrast, none of the binding affinity values predicted by the GNINA tool were good predictors of TTX resistance (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4). The binding affinity estimates from the rigid channel analysis (GNINA-R) for channels in the snake lineage were all within 1 kcal/mol of each other and the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d snake channel had the lowest binding energy estimate of \u22128.5 kcal/mol. The binding affinity estimates for channels in the salamander lineage were also within 1 kcal/mol and, though the \u201csuper-resistant\u201d salamander channel had a more positive value for binding affinity than the TTX-sensitive salamander channel, it was not the most positive value calculated for the lineage. Finally, the octopus channel had the lowest binding affinity estimates of all the channels analyzed.", "The binding affinity estimates from the GNINA analysis with flexible sidechains (GNINA-F) were lower for all channels compared to the values estimated using rigid channel GNINA analysis (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4). The range of values for all channels in the GNINA-F analysis was 1 kcal/mol overall; an intermediate resistance salamander channel had the lowest binding affinity estimate (SsNaV1.4, \u221213.1 kcal/mol) and the blue ringed octopus had the most positive binding affinity estimate (HlNaV1, \u221212.1 kcal/mol). There was no clear trend in these values that predicted known TTX resistance for the channels.", "Docking analysis with the GNINA tool provides another score of the ligand pose, the convolutional neural network (CNN) score, which evaluates the three-dimensional representation of the ligand poses. The GNINA tool provides CNN score values ranging from 0 to 1, with a score of 1 indicating a perfect ligand pose [45]. We used CNN scores from both rigid channel and flexible sidechain GNINA analyses to evaluate poses with the lowest binding affinity values (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4). The CNN scores for flexible sidechain docking (GNINA-F) were consistently higher than the CNN scores for rigid channel docking (GNINA-R). The rat channel (rNaV1.4) had the largest score value increase, from 0.41 to 0.84, though the values for one salamander channel decreased (TshanNaV1.4, from 0.41 to 0.37). This overall increase in CNN score values for flexible sidechain docking suggests that flexible docking using the GNINA tool (GNINA-F) may provide better pose estimates for TTX binding to VGSCs than rigid channel docking (GNINA-R)."]
