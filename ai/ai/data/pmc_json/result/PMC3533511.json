["Results", "Conserved motifs analysis and model prediction of otrC", "The otrC gene contains two open reading frames (ORFs), which encode a putative ATP-binding subunit (OtrC-ORF1) of 38\u2009kDa and a putative transmembrane subunit (OtrC-ORF2) of 30\u2009kDa. A NCBI BLAST search of the amino acid sequence of the OtrC protein identified a number of similar proteins, the majority of which were ABC components of doxorubicin or MDR ABC transporters from various phyla.", "The ATP-binding subunit usually contains conserved sequence motifs that play important roles in protein function. Therefore, an alignment of OtrC-ORF1 with DrrA\n[16] and Msr-ORF1 from Streptomyces[17] was performed for the identification of conserved motifs (Figure\n1). The results showed that OtrC-ORF1 exhibits 41% amino acid identity with the doxorubicin resistance protein DrrA from S. peucetius and 43% identity with the multidrug ABC transporter ATP -binding subunit Msr-ORF1 from S. rochei F20. The N-terminal of OtrC-ORF1 contains the well-described conserved Walker A and B motifs and the ABC signature sequence. These motifs are intimately involved in ATP hydrolysis\n[18], which indicates that OtrC belongs to the ABC transporter superfamily. The alignment also showed the conserved LDEADQLA and LDEVFL motifs in the C-terminal region of OtrC-ORF1. These motifs exhibit 58.6% and 80% identity with those of DrrA and Msr-ORF1, respectively. However, the CREEM motif was absent from OtrC-ORF1 and Msr-ORF1. The LDEVFL motif is known to be involved in the doxorubicin-stimulated nucleotide-binding function and also exists in the MDR protein\n[18]. Therefore, it was speculated that the ATPase activity of OtrC-ORF1 is stimulated by doxorubicin and other drugs.", "Figure 1Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the OtrC-ORF1 region with DrrA and Msr-ORF1.

OtrC-ORF2 was then aligned with other ABC transporters (Figure\n2). The conserved EAA motif (E1AA3RALG7) that is present in MalG was believed to be present only in the importers of the ABC family, while the G\u22122E\u22121\u2026A3R/K4\u2026G7 motif present in BtuC, which has similarity with EAA motif, has been identified in both the import and export functions of ABC transporters\n[19]. The alignment analysis revealed the present of a G\u22122\u2026.R4 motif that was present in all ABC transporter proteins with an exporter function, including EpeA, DrrB, MsbA and BtuC. The G\u22122 residue has been identified to correspond with drug sensitivity by site-directed mutagenesis\n[19]. We therefore assumed that the G\u22122\u2026.R4 motif was involved in the drug export function of the ABC transporter and OtrC functions as a drug exporter.", "Figure 2Alignment of the amino acid sequence of predicted conserved motifs of the transmembrane subunit, OtrC-ORF2, MsbA, DrrB, BtuC and MalG.

The reported canonical ABC systems display a modular architecture composed of two nucleotide-binding domains/subunits and two transmembrane domains/subunits. Therefore, it can be concluded that the OtrC system is a tetrameric complex composed of two homodimeric constituents, similar to that of many other bacterial ABC transporters\n[17].", "Functional characterization of OtrC", "E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the indicated plasmid pETC02 (Additional file\n1: Figure S1), while OtrC expression was induced by IPTG and analyzed by Coomassie blue staining of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. A band that corresponded to the 30-kDa OtrC-ORF2 was detected in the cytoplasmic membrane by SDS-PAGE (Figure\n3); however, although the OtrC-ORF2 was fused with a His6-tag at the C terminal, the specific band of the gene product was absent in the Western blot analysis. This could have been due to the embedding of the His6-tag by protein folding. The specific band that corresponded to the 68\u2009kDa-OtrC, 38\u2009kDa-OtrC-ORF1 subunit could be visualized in whole cell protein fraction by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Figure\n3).

The efflux activity of OtrC was further confirmed by determining the effect of an ABC transporter inhibitor orthovanadate on the accumulation of EB in OtrC-expressing and OtrC-nonexpressing cells. As the glycolysis pathway also can be inhibited by orthovanadate, cells were energized with ATP instead of glucose. As shown in Figure\n5B, orthovanadate increased the level of EB uptake in OtrC-expressing cells, while no increase was observed in OtrC-nonexpressing cells.
