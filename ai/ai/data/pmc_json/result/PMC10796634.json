["Results", "Localized ginsenoside hydrolysis occurs in the lesion area of P. notoginseng leaves with round spot disease in open field", "Round spot caused by the necrotrophic fungus M. acerina is a primary foliar disease occurring in cultured P. notoginseng. Given its high prevalence and severe consequences, we investigated chemical changes of specialized metabolites in PNLs with round spot disease collected from the open field. Specifically, different zones (illustrated in Fig.\u00a01a) of infected leaves from a single P. notoginseng plant were harvested for chemical analysis by LC-UV, including analysis of the lesion area (Zone I), a healthy area of the same leaf (Zone II), and a healthy area of a neighboring leaf (Zone III). Surprisingly, the chemical profile of the lesion tissue was clearly different from those of the other two zones and healthy leaves from a non-infected plant (CON) (Fig.\u00a01b). The main components identified in healthy leaves and lesion tissue were designated compounds 1\u20134 and 1a\u20134a, respectively, by the aid of their reference standards and LC\u2013MS analysis. The most plausible explanation for these differences is that ginsenoside hydrolysis might occur locally in the lesion tissue of PNLs with round spot disease. Specifically, ginsenosides Rb1 (1), Rc (2), Rb2 (3) and Rb3 (4), the main components of PNLs, were hydrolyzed to gypenoside XVII (1a), notoginsenoside Fe (2a), ginsenoside Rd2 (3a), and notoginsenoside Fd (4a), respectively, via the selective hydrolysis of an outer glucose from the \u03b2 (1\u2009\u2192\u20092)-glycosidic linkage at C-3 without cleavage of other glycosidic linkages (Fig.\u00a01c). In contrast, Fc (5) conjugated with a Glu-Glu-Xyl carbohydrate chain at C-3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01) was not hydrolyzed. Furthermore, to quantitatively characterize the hydrolysis process in PNLs under various stresses, the ratios of Fd to Rb3\u2009+\u2009Fd and Fe to Rc\u2009+\u2009Fe were defined as the hydrolysis turnover. Rb3 (4) and Rc (2) were the most abundant and second most abundant ginsenosides in PNLs, and their hydrolysis products were Fd (4a) and Fe (2a), respectively. As a result, the hydrolysis turnovers in Zone I of PNLs with round spot disease were significantly higher than those in other zones and the leaves of noninfected plants (Fig.\u00a01d).Fig. 1Localized ginsenoside hydrolysis occurs in the lesion area of P. notoginseng leaves with round spot disease in open field.a Different zone of the infected PNL was harvested for chemical analysis.

Inoculation with A. panax, a black spot disease pathogen causing foliar necrosis in PNLs, resulted in the development of severe lesions at 5 DPI. Significantly higher hydrolysis turnovers were observed in decayed tissue, compared with that in other zones and CON leaves (Fig.\u00a02c). However, non-pathogenic fungi, such as F. oxysporum (a root rot disease pathogen, Fig.\u00a02d) and Colletotrichum orchidophilum19 (an anthracnose disease pathogen found on Bletilla striata leaves, Fig.\u00a02e), failed to either infect the leaves or trigger ginsenoside hydrolysis. Our data indicates that ginsenoside hydrolysis is exclusively activated in lesion tissues of PNLs infected by a foliar pathogenic fungus.", "To determine whether a broth culture of a pathogenic fungus could cause hydrolysis, Rb3 was spiked into an M. acerina culture, and the spiked culture was incubated for 11 days. The hydrolysis product Fd was not detected, and no significant difference in Rb3 content was observed at different intervals (Fig.\u00a02f), indicating that enzymes secreted by M. acerina cannot trigger Rb3 hydrolysis.", "Next, dynamic chemical changes during fungal infection were characterized in M. acerina- and mock-inoculated PNLs in a time-course analysis. At the initial infection stage (0\u20133 DPI), there was no significant difference in Rb3 and Fd levels in infected tissue (Zone I) between mock-inoculated and M. acerina-inoculated plants. At 5 DPI, round or nearly round water-soaked spots were clearly observed in the PNLs (Fig.\u00a02g). Additionally, the level of Rb3 in Zone I was significantly decreased, and its hydrolysis product, Fd, was generated accordingly (Fig.\u00a02h), indicating that ginsenoside hydrolysis was activated upon successful fungal colonization. Interestingly, the levels of the hydrolysis products peaked in infected PNLs at 11 DPI, and the molar amounts of Fd, Fe, Rd2 and XVII in M. acerina-infected PNLs were increased approximately 7.8-fold, 3.2-fold, 2.9-fold, and 2.2-fold, respectively, compared with the amounts of the intact ginsenosides in mock-treated PNLs (Fig.\u00a02h and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). This excessive accumulation of hydrolysis products in decayed tissue suggests that ginsenoside biosynthesis might also be enhanced, in addition to ginsenoside hydrolysis, to produce greater amounts of hydrolysis products upon fungal infection. Furthermore, no significant difference in Rb3 or Fd levels was observed in either Zone II or Zone III between mock-treated and fungus-infected PNLs during the entire infection period (Fig.\u00a02i, j), confirming that ginsenoside hydrolysis was locally activated in the lesion tissue of PNLs infected with the pathogenic fungus. Similar dynamic changes in other pairs of ginsenosides, including Rc/Fe (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a), Rb2/Rd2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b), and Rb1/XVII (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c) were also observed. Still, no significant difference in Fc levels in decayed tissue was found between mock-treated and fungus-infected PNLs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02d).", "PnGH1, a \u03b2-glucosidase, is responsible for ginsenoside hydrolysis in P. notoginseng leaves", "To identify the glucosidase potentially involved in regioselective ginsenoside hydrolysis in PNLs, the crude protein obtained from the PNL homogenate was fractionated following an activity-guided protein-purification procedure comprising ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a). This led to the successful purification of the expected glucosidase that could efficiently hydrolyze Rb3 (4) to Fd (4a). The purified protein was then digested with sequencing-grade trypsin and subsequently analyzed by Nano LC-LTQ Orbitrap MS to construct a peptide library of accessible amino acid sequences. RNA sequencing of samples from the leaves, stems, and roots of P. notoginseng yielded 328 transcripts and 125 unigenes annotated as glycosidases. Given that ginsenoside hydrolysis occurs predominantly in PNLs, 33 transcripts and 19 unigenes that were highly expressed in the leaves were selected as a candidate gene library (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03b). Then, mutual sequence alignment analysis between the peptide and transcript libraries was performed, resulting in the identification of three candidate genes (PnGH1-3) with a SEQUEST HT score >10 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a and Supplementary Table\u00a01), among which the protein encoded by PnGH1 had the highest match score of 509.45.", "Subsequent heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and purification via Ni2+ affinity chromatography allowed us to obtain the recombinant proteins PnGH1-3 (Fig.\u00a03a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). However, when these three recombinant proteins were individually incubated with Rb3 (4), only PnGH1 exhibited glucosidase activity resulting in the generation of 4a (Fig.\u00a03a). The molecule represented by this peak was unambiguously identified as Fd at the structural level through the analysis of its HRESI MS, 1D- and 2D-NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05\u20129). The in vivo biochemical function of PnGH1 was further investigated in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves via Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010), which also led to the generation of Fd after Rb3 was injected. PnGH1 remained active in a broad pH range from 3.0 to 9.0, and a temperature range from 10 to 80\u2009\u00b0C (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011). The kinetic analysis of PnGH1 under the identified optimal conditions (pH 5.0, 60\u2009\u00b0C) indicated a KM\u2009=\u2009677.0\u2009\u00b1\u200938.5\u2009\u00b5M, kcat\u2009=\u20093.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009s\u22121, and kcat/KM\u2009=\u20095.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009s\u22121\u2009\u00b5M\u22121 for Rb3 (Fig.\u00a03a), demonstrating the high substrate affinity and considerable catalysis efficiency of PnGH1. Remarkably, PnGH1 could accept structurally diverse PPD-type ginsenosides originating from Panax species, including Rb1 (1), Rc (2), Rb2 (3), Rb3 (4), Ra2 (6), Ra3 (7), Ra1 (8), Rd (9), and Rg3 (10), as substrates to produce the corresponding deglycosylated products (1a\u20134a and 6a\u201310a) via the regioselective hydrolysis of the common \u03b2 (1\u2009\u2192\u20092)-glycosidic linkage at C-3 (Supplementary Figs.\u00a012, 13). In contrast, PnGH1 could not accept the PPT-type ginsenoside Rf or the flavonoid glycoside baimaside as a substrate (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014).Fig. 3Functional, biochemical characterization, and structural investigation of PnGH1.a SDS\u2013PAGE analysis, HPLC chromatogram, and kinetic study of the PnGH1-conducted hydrolysis reaction of Rb3 to form Fd.

Phylogenetic analysis of PnGH1 and currently reported \u03b2-glucosidases involved in plant defence found that PnGH1 located at a distinct evolutionary branch compared with others (Supplementary Fig.\u00a015b)20,21. Signal peptide prediction using iPSORT22 revealed the presence of an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide in PnGH1. Transient expression of a PnGH1-GFP fusion product in Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that PnGH1 is a chloroplast-localized glucosidase (Fig.\u00a03b), which was consistent with the finding that ginsenoside hydrolysis occurs mainly in PNLs.", "The structural basis of the regioselective hydrolysis ability of PnGH1 was further explored based on homology modeling (Supplementary Figs.\u00a016, 17). The core structure of PnGH1 contained eight parallel \u03b2-strands surrounded by eight helices forming the (\u03b2/\u03b1)8 barrel fold as a substrate-binding pocket (Fig.\u00a03c). In addition, several salt bridges between Asp/Glu residues and Lys/Arg residues were observed, which could make great contributions to the temperature tolerance of PnGH1 by stabilizing the protein structure. Further in silico docking and simulation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018) of Rg3 with PnGH1 revealed that the \u03b2-(1,2)-linked glycosidic bond at C-3 was positioned deep within the catalytic pocket, while the other side of the substrate-binding pocket exhibited a wide, open entrance (Fig.\u00a03d), making it possible for the protein to accommodate various PPD-type ginsenosides with different substituents at C-20. PnGH1 retained the glutamic acid-containing catalytic motifs TFN(E/D)P and (V/Y)ITENG, which are highly conserved in other known GH1 \u03b2-glucosidases (Supplementary Fig.\u00a019)20. Comprehensive analysis of the amino acid residues lining the catalytic pocket (Fig.\u00a03e) revealed that the critical residues E232 in the TFNE/DP motif and E425 in the (V/Y)ITENG motif were indeed situated on opposite sides of the \u03b2-(1,2)-linked glycosidic bond, indicating a distance of 3.5\u2009\u00c5 between the OE2 atom of E425 (Onucleophile) and the anomeric carbon (Celectrophile) and 3.3\u2009\u00c5 between the OE2 atom of E232 and the oxygen atom of the leaving sugar group (Oleaving). The measured Onucleophile\u2013Celectrophile\u2013Oleaving angle was 173\u00b0 (Fig.\u00a03e). In addition, the distance between E232 and E425 was 5.0\u2009\u00c5 (Fig.\u00a03d), suggesting that PnGH1 is a retaining glucosidase rather than an inverting enzyme, in which the distance between these two catalytic residues would be ~10.0\u2009\u00c523. The above results suggest that PnGH1 employs the well-studied acid-catalytic retaining mechanism23 requiring the involvement of two critical carboxylate residues, E232 and E425 (Fig.\u00a03f). Accordingly, the mutagenesis of E232 and E425 to alanine deactivated the hydrolysis activity of PnGH1. In contrast, when E232 was replaced with aspartic acid, the enzyme activity could be effectively recovered (Fig.\u00a03g). This observation further indicated the crucial role of carboxylate residues in the hydrolysis process. Docking results showed that several other residues, in addition to E232 and E425, were located in the catalytic pocket of PnGH1 and interacted with the substrate (Fig.\u00a03e, Supplementary Table\u00a02) through hydrogen-bond interactions (including Q90, H186, N231, K398, E425, E493, and Y503) and hydrophobic interactions (Y234). Alanine screening mutagenesis of these residues also led to an apparent decrease in enzymatic activity (Fig.\u00a03g), which further supported their participation in the hydrolysis process.", "PnGH1 catalyzes the\u00a0hydrolysis upon chloroplast disruption caused by induced exoenzymes of M. acerina", "To reveal how chloroplast-localized PnGH1 triggers hydrolysis of ginsenosides that are possibly localized in the cytoplasm, we first investigated whether ginsenoside hydrolysis was activated in PNLs upon mechanical tissue damage. Homogenization with a bead mill was found to achieve adequate cell disruption, mimicking the tissue damage caused by attackers24. PnGH1 substrates (1\u20134) in fresh healthy PNLs were entirely hydrolyzed to their corresponding products (1a\u20134a), as measured by HPLC-UV (Fig.\u00a04a), indicating that ginsenoside hydrolysis occurs in healthy PNLs upon tissue damage.Fig. 4PnGH1 catalyzes ginsenoside hydrolysis upon chloroplast disruption caused by induced-exoenzymes of M. acerina.a HPLC-UV analysis of healthy PNL with (above) or without (below) homogenization by bead milling. b Representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs of PNL inoculated by PDA disc with and without M. acerina at 5 DPI (left, scale bars\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u03bcm; right, zoomed chloroplast, scale bars\u2009=\u20090.2\u2009\u03bcm). c Pectin methylgalacturonase (PMG) activities, n\u2009=\u20095 biologically independent samples. d Photographs of representative symptoms in PNL inoculated with controls and crude exoenzyme induced by PNL in vivo and in vitro, and pectin (Pec) at the concentration of 3 and 8\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121 at 5 DPI.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.", "To determine whether fungal infection caused chloroplast disruption in PNLs, the ultrastructure of infected PNLs was observed by TEM. In mock-treated PNLs, chloroplasts with an elliptical or lens-like shape were arranged along the plasma membrane, with distinct grana stacking and an intact chloroplast envelope (Fig.\u00a04b). Infection with M. acerina caused cell integrity loss, severe plasmolysis, and organelle disintegration of various degrees in the PNLs. Severe chloroplast degradation was observed, including disruption of the chloroplast membrane and degradation of grana and stroma thylakoids (Fig.\u00a04b), indicating that fungal infection causes chloroplast membrane disruption, following by the activation of ginsenoside hydrolysis.", "Extracellular enzymes, especially pectolytic enzymes, play a crucial role in the fungal colonization of plant hosts25. To further investigate how M. acerina infection causes cell chloroplast membrane disruption in PNLs, crude exoenzymes of M. acerina whose expression was induced by exposure to PNL tissue (both in vivo and in vitro) or pectin (induced exoenzymes) were obtained, and their effects on plant leaves were investigated by the inoculation of PNLs with the exoenzymes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a020a). The crude exoenzymes induced by PNLs and pectin promoted significantly higher polymethyl galacturonase (PMG, pectin hydrolase) activity than the broth culture of M. acerina, and the highest activity of PMG was found in medium containing pectin (Fig.\u00a04c). The blank (distilled water) and control samples, including steamed PNLs without fungal inoculation (Con_vivo, 8\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121) and M. acerina-inoculated medium without pectin or PNL tissue (Con_vitro, 8\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121), failed to produce any lesions on PNLs. However, the inoculation with crude exoenzymes at 3 and 8\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121 using absorbent cotton led to leaf wilting (Supplementary Fig.\u00a020b) and induced severe necrotic lesions in the leaves at 4 DPI (Fig.\u00a04d), especially in pectin-induced samples, indicating the possible involvement of induced exoenzymes in necrotic lesion development.", "The ultrastructure of exoenzyme-inoculated leaves observed by TEM indicated chloroplast degradation and membrane disruption (Fig.\u00a04e). The chemical analysis of decayed tissue also indicated that PnGH1 substrates were completely hydrolyzed after inoculation with induced exoenzymes, except in the in vivo group treated with a low concentration (3\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121, Fig.\u00a04f, Supplementary Fig.\u00a020b). A similar result was observed for the hydrolysis turnover (Fig.\u00a04g). Collectively, the symptoms, chloroplast ultrastructure and chemical changes observed in the leaves treated with induced exoenzymes were similar to those caused by infection with M. acerina, suggesting that PnGH1 catalyzes ginsenoside hydrolysis upon chloroplast membrane disruption caused by induced exoenzymes of M. acerina.", "Hydrolysis products participate in plant chemical defence by inhibiting pathogen growth", "To evaluate the possible biological significance of PnGH1-mediated ginsenoside hydrolysis for plant defence, the toxic effects of intact ginsenosides and their hydrolysis products against fungal growth were compared in vitro and in vivo. Refined total saponin extracts of PNLs before (TS-b) and after (TS-a) hydrolysis, mainly containing intact ginsenosides and hydrolysis products, respectively, were prepared and purified by transformation and using microporous resins26 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a021a). TS-b showed weak inhibitory activity against M. acerina growth, whereas growth inhibition by TS-a was dose-dependent and reached 80.8% at 4\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121. TS-a exhibited significantly stronger inhibitory effects against M. acerina growth at the applied concentrations (0.13\u20134\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121) than TS-b (Fig.\u00a05a, b). A similar tendency was observed in A. panax (Fig.\u00a05c, Supplementary Fig.\u00a021b) and F. oxysporum (Supplementary Fig.\u00a021c, d), indicating that refined extracts containing hydrolysis products are more toxic to a broad spectrum of fungi at the tested concentration ranges than intact ginsenosides. The inhibition of M. acerina growth after exposure to a series of concentrations of individual intact ginsenosides (i.e., Rb3, Rc, and Rb1) and their hydrolysis products (i.e., Fd, Fe, and XVII, respectively) was also examined. As expected, Fd, Fe, and XVII exhibited more potent inhibitory effects against M. acerina than their intact ginsenosides Rb3, Rc, and Rb1, respectively (Fig.\u00a05d, Supplementary Fig.\u00a021e\u2013g). Interestingly, Fd, the most abundant component in decayed PNLs, exhibited the most potent antifungal activity against M. acerina (Fig.\u00a05d).Fig. 5Hydrolysis products participate in plant chemical defence by inhibiting pathogen growth in vitro and in vivo.a, b Hydrolysis products suppressed the mycelial growth of M. acerina in a dose-dependent manner.
