["2. Results", "2.1. Screening for Cellulase Overproducing Mutant Strains", "In order to produce mutants, mutagens EMS and NTG with UV were utilized. Various doses of the mutagens EMS (0.620\u20131.48 mM), NTG (2\u20135 \u00b5g) grains and UV (1\u201310 min) were tested to find out the optimum dose. Optimal rates were observed at 0.931 mM of EMS, 2 \u00b5g grains of NTG, and exposure to UV for 3 min, respectively.", "After mutagenesis by the combination of EMS and UV, a total of 400 mutants were evaluated for increased cellulase production. Three mutants with increased cellulase production: EUA9, EUB8, and EUD6, were selected for further study. Similarly, after mutagenesis by NTG and UV mutagens, 298 colonies were evaluated, and NUA7, NUB2, and NUD8 were selected for recursive protoplast fusion. All six mutants had a slight increase in cellulase production in the range of 3.77\u20135.9 IU/mL compared to the wild type (3.77 IU/mL) referred to in Table 1.", "2.2. Genome Shuffling by Recursive Protoplast Fusion", "Protoplast preparation efficiency was enhanced to 70% by the addition of lysozyme in the protoplast buffer. Inclusions of Mutanolysin in the protoplast buffer further increased the frequency of protoplast formation to 92%.", "The six mutants with increased cellulase production (EUA9, EUB8, EUD6, NUA7, NUB2, and NUD8) were employed for the first round of fusion. After the first round of shuffling, ninety colonies were screened for faster growth and bigger zone of hydrolysis. The shuffled strains G1, G21, G24, and G56 had CMCase activity of 7.27 IU/mL, 7.69 IU/mL, 7.91 IU/mL, and 8.06 IU/mL with an enhancement of 93%, 104%, 110%, and 114%, respectively, over the wild type (3.77 IU/mL). The increase in the zone of hydrolysis ranged from 2.2\u20132.5cm. Four isolates were selected for a second round of genome shuffling. After the second round of genome shuffling, 50 isolates were screened. The colonies Gb2, Gc8, and Gd7 showed CMCase activity of 8.9 IU/mL, 9.5 IU/mL, and 10.08 IU/mL corresponding to a 136%, 151%, and 167% enhancement over the wild type, respectively, with a zone of hydrolysis ranging from 3.15 cm to 3.5 cm (Figure 1).", "The efficiency of improved strains utilization of other carbon sources was analyzed using filter paper, carboxy methyl cellulose, cellobiose, and cotton gin waste. Supernatants from cultures grown for 54 h on an 8% wheat bran medium in a shake flask had 53\u201375%, 136\u2013167%, 60\u201396% and 20\u201340% enhancement in FPase, CMCase, cotton gin waste, and Cellobiose assays compared to the wild type strain. Activities of FPase, CMCase, cotton gin waste, Cellobiose, and extracellular protein concentrations of the shuffled strains were higher than that of the wild types, as shown in Table 2. The wild type VS15 and the highest producer of all the fusants Gd7 were analyzed for CMCase, FPase, and cellobiase production with respect to the growth curve in an 8% Wheat bran medium at 37 \u00b0C (Figure 2a,b).", "2.3. Utilization of Cotton Gin Waste as a Substrate", "Acid pre-treatment increased enzymatic hydrolysis and sugar release of the cotton ginning waste. Initially, an increase in acidic concentration resulted in higher sugar releases from 8.93 IU/mL at 1% to 11.08 IU/mL at 3%. A further increase in the acid concentration past 3% caused decreases in the release of sugars to 7.56 IU/mL at 5% and 7.43 IU/mL at 7%. The optimum acid concentration for the pre-treatment was set at 3%. Gb-2, Gc-8 and Gd-7 isolates were used. At 3% concentration, acid showed 9.05 IU/mL, 9.78 IU/mL, and 11.08 IU/mL activity with an enhancement of 60%, 73%, and 96%, respectively, when compared to that of wild types (5.654 IU/mL) on cotton gin waste (Table 2).", "2.4. Hydrolysis Activity of VS 15 and the Shuffled Strains on the CMC Agar Plates", "Zone of clearance and colony diameter was measured by using Image J software after 16 h of incubation. Shuffled strains Gb2, Gc8, and Gd7 showed a maximum zone of hydrolysis in the range of 232\u2013244 cm2 around the colony, with a diameter in the range 79\u201389 cm2, an approximately 1.5 fold increase over the wild type zone of hydrolysis of 121 cm2 and colony diameter of 52 cm2.", "2.5. Bioethanol Production", "Previous studies reported that through the action of cellulase enzyme, bioethanol production was achieved involving simultaneous mechanism of fermentation and saccharification with saccharomyces cerevisiae [22]. In this study, the fermentation of VS15 and Gd7 in 8% wheat bran medium and saccharification with 1% saccharomyces cerevisae, converts the cellulose into ethanol. Further, the ethanol production was confirmed by the K2Cr2O7 method. Through the reaction of K2Cr2O7 with these samples, it was observed that a color change occurred from yellow-orange to green blue. These significant results showed that saccharomyces cerevisae utilized the liberated sugars from cellulose degradation and show that Bacillus subtilis VS15 and Gd7 strains are capable of fermenting wheat bran to facilitate the production of biofuel.", "2.6. Whole Genome Sequence", "Whole Genome sequence data is deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank for the strains VS15 and Gd7 under the accession numbers QFZO00000000 and MSEJ00000000, respectively.

Out of total 4358 affected genes in Gd7, 4176 genes are protein coding, 80 rRNA, 67 pseudogenes, 27 sRNA, 6 lincRNA, 1 antisense, and 1 ribozyme gene. The effect of variation in both the samples is more abundant in RNA encoding genes. 481 unique SNPs were found in VS15, whereas in Gd7, 6112 unique SNPs were found, which were represented in a Venn diagram (Figure 3). A total of 28 unique indels were predicted for sample VS15 and 374 unique indels were predicted by DELLY in Gd7 (Figure 4).

In sample Gd7, 8548 direct repeats have been predicted with the average length of 286 bp.", "2.8. Specific Gene Set Analysis for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)", "A total of eight genes playing a key role in cellulase production were selected. Four genes (bglA, bglC and bglH and EglS) cause hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. BGL family genes are \u03b2-glucosidases, which hydrolyze the non-reducing end \u03b2-D-glucosyl residues to release glucose. Among the three BGL family genes (bglA, bglC, and bglH), one unique mutation was observed in the bglH gene region at position 4033186 (A substituted with G) compared to its wild type. However, no change in the translated message could be found (Figure S3). EglS is a hydrolytic enzyme which hydrolyzes the \u03b2 (1\u20134) d-glucosidic linkage. A unique mutation in Gd7 was identified at position 1941335 (changing base A to G). This mutation does not affect the translated messenger RNA or repress the gene function.", "Three genes are involved in the regulation of cellulase production. Regulation is mainly caused by carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and LicT anti-termination. The antiterminator LicT specifically binds to the genes involved in cellulase production. LicT positively regulates bglC gene [24]. The absolute binding position of LicT on bglC genes is located in the region starting from 4035760 to 4035792 with +25 bp upstream and +57 bp downstream, and the binding sequence/cis-element is GGATTGTTACTGCGAAAGCAGGCAAAACCTAAA. Four SNPs are associated with the binding range of LicT on bglC. Out of these four SNPs, three were located within additional +54bp downstream to the absolute binding position, whereas one SNP occurred at 4,035,780 bp, within the actual LicT-bglC binding site (changing base G to A). Although we did not find any variation in the gene expression of the active gene, these mutations may indirectly influence the enhanced cellulase production.", "The CCR mechanism in Bacillus subtilis is controlled by CcpA and HprK phosphorylation. Sugar transportation is initiated by entry of glucose via the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) along with the EIICBAGlc component, which provides phosphorylation to the received glucose. The resultant glucose phosphate (Glc-P) activates Hpr that phosphorylates at two sites, serine and histidine. At the serine regulatory site, Hpr is phosphorylated as Hpr-S46-P, with the consumption of ATP. Later, Hpr-S46-P couples with regulatory protein CcpA. The Hpr-S46-P-CcpA complex binds to DNA at the cre (catabolite responsive element) site in the promoter region of the target gene that represses the transcription of the gene encoding hydrolytic enzymes (cellulase, xylanase etc.). In our study, within the CcpA region, nine SNPs were identified in Gd7, while six SNPs were identified in VS15, when the genome of those strains was compared to the reference strain Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168. Three unique mutations were identified in the mutant Gd7 at positions 3044276 (G to A), 3044348 (A to G), and 3044930 (C to T) compared to its wild type.", "In Bacillus subtilis, Hpr is a signaling intermediate which is phosphorylated by HprK. Eight SNPs were found in VS15, whereas eleven SNPs were found in Gd7 compared to the reference strain Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168. Among these eleven SNPs, three unique mutations were observed in the mutant (Gd7) at positions 3594559 (C to T), 3595004 (T to C), and 3595028 (C to T) compared to its wild type (VS15). However, no change in the amino acid sequence was observed.", "YxaL is a protein kinase enzyme, and repression or deletion of this enzyme results in various defects in glucose metabolism, which tends to force the cell under starvation condition and looking for the alternative source. This condition causes starved cells to switch to the production of hydrolytic enzymes and uptake of cellular storage . YxaL is important for the production of hydrolytic enzymes. Here we found three unique mutations at positions 4102465 (A to T), 4102474 (T to C) and 4102591 (A to C), although these mutations do not alter the translated message.", "The detailed SNP distribution among the specific gene set is shown in Table 5 and File S1a.", "2.9. Specific Gene Set Analysis for InDels", "For the selected gene set, InDels for both VS15 and Gd7 samples were analyzed and insertions were found in all of the samples. Three InDels in sample VS15 (Table 6 and Table 7) and seven InDels in sample Gd7 (Table 8 and Table 9) were found compared to the reference strain Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168. These InDels have been found upstream within 5 kb of the gene. Among these seven InDels in Gd7, BglC, and LicT genes were affected three times, whereas EglS, gene were affected two times. In wild type (VS15) BglC, EglS, and LicT genes had 1 InDel each. In Gd7, seven InDels were observed, with four being unique InDels when compared to the wild type (VS15). A nucleotide insertion was observed in BglC at a position 369225 (G is inserted at reference base T and the altered base composition was TG) \u22121.034 kb upstream to the gene.", "The licT gene had two insertions, one at a position 4011724 (GAG is inserted in the position T and the altered bases are TGAG) \u22121.142 kb upstream to the gene, and the other at the position 4011712 with three nucleotide insertions (ACA is inserted in the reference position T and the altered bases are TACA) \u22121.154 kb upstream to the gene.", "A single nucleotide insertion in EglS was observed at position 1938628 (T is inserted in the reference position G and the altered base pair is GT) \u22121.997 kb upstream to the gene region. All these InDels did not alter the translated messenger RNA.", "Besides Indels away from the orfs, Indels could also be located within genes also (Table 7 and Table 9). These deletions/insertions lead to frame shift in the reading frame of the ribosome leading resulting in altered translated sequence(as in fatR and GpsA; File S4) and can lead to altered expression of respective genes or loss of function. These altered expression of these genes possibly influence the cellulase expression."]
