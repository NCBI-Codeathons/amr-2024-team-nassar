["RESULTS", "Identification of an orphan SAH in Xanthomonas.", "In the Xanthomonas model organism X. campestris pv. campestris 8004, we identified a single-domain open reading frame (XC_RS15930, designated XccSAH hereafter) homologous to the hydrolase domain of the bifunctional synthetase hydrolase SpoT (Table\u00a02). Compared to Mesh1 in metazoans (28, 32), XccSAH belongs to the phylogenetically distinct sister group known as Mesh1-L (16). Unlike Mesh1, XccSAH does not have a well-defined nicotinamide ribose interaction motif, which has been proposed to allow NADPH hydrolysis (32) (Fig.\u00a01B). In general, XccSAH contains key domain architectures of an alarmone hydrolase, with conserved residues that are critical for nucleotide base coordination, metal coordination, and nucleophilic attack of the 3\u2032-phosphates (Fig.\u00a01B, HD1-6) (42). These features suggest that XccSAH is likely a functional alarmone hydrolase.", "Proteins exhibiting homology with the (p)ppGpp hydrolase domains of RelA and SpoT in X. campestris pv. campestris 8004", "Query sequence Gene ID (NCBI) Sequence identity (%) Function annotation P value.", "RelA hydrolase domain XC_RS05900 (relA) 100 Bifunctional (p)ppGpp 1.00E\u221297.", "XC_RS04795 (spoT) 36.43 Synthetase/guanosine-3\u2032,5\u2032-bis(diphosphate) 3.00E\u221210.", "XC_RS10860 35.85 \u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase 0.53.", "XC_RS21410 32.26 ATP-dependent DNA helicase Rep 0.92.", "XC_RS04970 44.12 Assimilatory sulfite reductase (NADPH) 4.9.", "XC_RS00080 33.87 Hypothetical protein 6.8.", "XC_RS00850 28.36 Aminotransferase 7.3.", "SpoT hydrolase domain XC_RS04795 (spoT) 100 Synthetase/guanosine-3\u2032,5\u2032-bis(diphosphate) 6.00E\u221298.", "XC_RS15930 (sah) 30.53 HD domain-containing protein 1.00E\u221212.", "XC_RS05900 (relA) 36.43 Bifunctional (p)ppGpp 9.00E\u221211.", "XC_RS06855 26.15 OsmC family peroxiredoxin 2.5.", "XC_RS09145 32.43 GGDEF-domain containing protein 2.6.", "XC_RS13715 38.71 Methionine synthase 6.9.", "XC_RS18395 23.64 Cystathionine beta-synthase 8.", "XccSAH hydrolyzes multiple alarmones and NADPH with different efficiencies.", "To examine the biochemical properties of XccSAH, we recombinantly expressed and purified XccSAH from Escherichia coli, performed in vitro enzymatic assays by incubating XccSAH with radiolabeled alarmones, and monitored the products of the reaction using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (Fig.\u00a02A to E). For comparison, the bifunctional RSH enzyme Rel (historically called RelA) (17, 43) from the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which has (p)ppGpp hydrolysis activity, and its hydrolase-defective variant RelR44Q were used as controls. Similar to B. subtilis Rel, XccSAH efficiently hydrolyzed ppGpp and pppGpp to GDP and GTP, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A and B) and required manganese (Mn2+) for its activity (Fig.\u00a02C). This metal selectivity was consistent with other previously reported (p)ppGpp hydrolases (29, 44). We found that B. subtilis Rel could also hydrolyze pGpp to GMP (Fig.\u00a02D) but had no detectable pppApp hydrolysis activity (Fig.\u00a02E). In contrast, XccSAH hydrolyzed all alarmones tested, including pGpp and pppApp, to GMP and ATP, respectively (Fig.\u00a02D and E). For pppApp hydrolysis, the additional spot under ATP is 32P-labeled pyrophosphate, since the pppApp was labeled with both 5\u2032-\u03b3-32P and 3\u2032-\u03b2-32P (Fig.\u00a02E).

Among the four substrates, XccSAH hydrolyzed pppApp most efficiently, with a kcat of 48.75\u2009\u00b1\u20092.99 s\u22121 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) and kcat/Km ratio (catalytic efficiency) of (10.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75)\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 s\u22121 M\u22121 (Table\u00a03). pppGpp and ppGpp hydrolysis was ~50% less efficient than pppApp, with kcat/Km ratios of (5.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.82)\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 s\u22121 M\u22121 for ppGpp and (4.93\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25)\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 s\u22121 M\u22121 for pppGpp (Table\u00a03).

Since XccSAH lacks a known nicotinamide riboside interaction (NR) motif (Fig.\u00a01B), we were unsure whether XccSAH would be able to hydrolyze NADPH. Therefore, we incubated NADPH with or without XccSAH in vitro, followed by chemical validation of the product in the reaction mix by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Interestingly, we detected significant (~80%) hydrolysis of NADPH to NADH in the presence of XccSAH, while no NADH generation was detected in the enzyme-free control (Fig.\u00a03A and B). This finding demonstrated that XccSAH is also an NADPH phosphatase. Next, we measured the catalytic parameters of XccSAH on NADPH hydrolysis by monitoring inorganic phosphate release in a malachite green assay (Fig.\u00a03C and D). XccSAH hydrolyzed NADPH with a Km of 132\u2009\u00b1\u200939.1\u2009\u03bcM and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of (3.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30)\u2009\u00d7\u2009102 s\u22121 M\u22121 (Fig.\u00a03E).

The guanylate alarmones pppGpp and ppGpp are induced by amino acid starvation in a variety of bacterial species (3). In the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, pGpp also accumulates to high levels during amino acid starvation through hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp (12). We measured the levels of pGpp, ppGpp, pppGpp, and NADPH using LC-MS (25) in wild-type X. campestris pv. campestris, \u0394sah, and \u0394sah::Psah complementation strains before and after treatment with a nonfunctional serine analog, serine hydroxamate (SHX), which mimics amino acid starvation in bacteria. In wild-type X. campestris pv. campestris, we detected increases of pGpp, ppGpp, pppGpp, and NADPH upon 30\u2009min of SHX treatment (Fig.\u00a04A to D), while no (p)ppApp was detected. The presence of pGpp suggests that X. campestris pv. campestris RSHs may be able to produce pGpp, as recently reported in Clostridiodes difficile (19), or that it contains Nudix hydrolases that can convert (p)ppGpp to pGpp, similar to NahA in B. subtilis (12). Importantly, the \u0394sah mutant showed elevation of pGpp (Fig.\u00a04A), ppGpp (Fig.\u00a04B), pppGpp (Fig.\u00a04C), and NADPH (Fig.\u00a04D) compared to the wild type (WT) or the \u0394sah::Psah complemented strain.

X. campestris pv. campestris lacking sah grew similarly to wild-type cells in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Fig.\u00a06C) but displayed compromised growth in morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) defined medium supplemented with amino acids, with an \u224810% reduction in growth rate (Fig.\u00a06D) and no detectable difference in the optical density/viability ratio (Fig.\u00a0S2). The growth reduction was complemented by ectopic sah expression (Fig.\u00a06D), suggesting that the defect is dependent on XccSAH. These results suggest that XccSAH modestly promotes growth of X. campestris pv. campestris, which will provide a selective advantage over the long run.", "Growth reduction of sah mutant is not due to difference in optical densities.

To test this hypothesis, we performed metabolite profiling of wild-type, \u0394sah, and sah complementation strains in the same media (Fig.\u00a06D) using LC-MS. Comparison of metabolite levels between wild type and \u0394sah mutants revealed that the levels of most metabolites, including nucleotides and cell wall precursors, were largely similar between the strains (Fig.\u00a07A). In addition, no (pp)pGpp or pppApp was detected in either WT or \u0394sah, indicating that the alarmones were not induced or were below the detection limit during exponential growth under this condition. However, the level of the NADH cofactor was significantly lower (~10-fold) in the \u0394sah mutant (Fig.\u00a07B). In addition, the \u0394sah mutant also displayed a small (~50%) increase in NAD+ compared to wild-type cells (Fig.\u00a07C), while NADPH and NADP+ levels had no significant differences (Fig.\u00a07D and E). The drop in NADH in the \u0394sah mutant was not due to defects in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a major source of NADH generation, since the levels of TCA cycle metabolites remained similar or even slightly higher in the mutant (Fig.\u00a0S3). Instead, the depletion of NADH due to loss of XccSAH corroborated our finding that XccSAH can generate NADH from NADPH in vitro (Fig.\u00a03A and B). Importantly, reintroducing the sah gene to the \u0394sah mutant restored NADH level back to wild-type levels (Fig.\u00a07A and B). Together, the results suggest that XccSAH contributes to the maintenance of the NADH pool through dephosphorylation of NADPH.", "FIG\u00a07XccSAH regulates NADH levels in X. campestris pv. campestris during growth in defined media supplemented with amino acids.
