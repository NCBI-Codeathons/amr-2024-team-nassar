["RESULTS", "Aminoglycosides inhibit a broad range of phages.", "To investigate a potential antiviral activity of aminoglycosides, we first constructed resistant strains carrying a plasmid-borne resistance cassette encoding an aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme (Table\u00a0S1 and S2A). With respect to the aminoglycosides selected for this study, we focused on antibiotics produced by Streptomyces species and included the atypical aminoglycoside streptomycin, aminoglycosides containing a monosubstituted deoxystreptamine ring (apramycin and hygromycin), kanamycin (4,6-di-substituted deoxystreptamine ring), and the aminocyclitol spectinomycin (13, 14). We challenged the aminoglycoside-resistant strains with a set of different phages using double-agar overlays with increasing aminoglycoside concentrations as screening platform (Fig.\u00a01a). In the screening, we included phages from three different viral realms (15): dsDNA viruses from the order Caudovirales in Duplodnaviria (families Sipho-, Myo-, and Podoviridae), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses from the family Inoviridae in Monodnaviria, and ssRNA viruses from the family Leviviridae in Riboviria (Table\u00a0S2B). The efficiency of plating comparing plaque formation under aminoglycoside pressure with aminoglycoside-free conditions was calculated for phages infecting either the actinobacterial model species Streptomyces venezuelae, Streptomyces coelicolor, and Corynebacterium glutamicum or the Gram-negative species Escherichia coli (Fig.\u00a01b).", "FIG\u00a01Aminoglycosides inhibit a wide range of phages.

In contrast, all phages infecting S. coelicolor, CL31 infecting C. glutamicum MB001, and the T phages, RNA phage MS2, and filamentous phages M13 and fd infecting E. coli displayed no susceptibility to the tested aminoglycosides.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a reinfection experiment, in which cells surviving the first round of infection were washed and exposed to the same phage again. In the first infection round, cultures without apramycin showed a strongly increasing phage titer associated with extensive lysis of the culture. In contrast, infection in the presence of apramycin was completely inhibited, showing no phage amplification during \u03bb infection and even an ~100-fold decrease in phage titers over time for Alderaan (Fig.\u00a02d and Fig.\u00a0S2c).", "Interestingly, removal of the antibiotic and reinfection of cells from apramycin-treated cultures resulted in similar amplification kinetics of Alderaan and \u03bb compared to an untreated control. Hence, these results do not support the selection of genetically encoded resistance traits or, in the case of \u03bb, an increased formation of lysogens but rather indicate a reversible antiphage effect of apramycin.", "Since elevated Mg2+ levels were previously shown to interfere with aminoglycoside uptake (16) and streptomycin-mediated inhibition of phage infection (12), we examined whether the antiviral effect of apramycin is alleviated in the presence of MgCl2. As shown in Fig.\u00a02e, phage infection was completely restored by the addition of 5\u2009mM MgCl2, as evidenced by the strong growth defect and the increasing phage titer during infection. Comparable results regarding the antagonistic effects of MgCl2 were also obtained for \u03bb (Fig.\u00a0S2d). Overall, these results suggest that the antiviral effect of aminoglycosides is based on an interference with phage infection at the intracellular level, probably during or shortly after phage DNA injection.", "Spent medium of a natural aminoglycoside producer provides protection against phage predation.", "As Streptomyces are the natural producers of aminoglycosides, we examined whether infection of S. venezuelae in spent medium of the apramycin producer Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius (formerly known as Streptomyces tenebrarius [17]) provides protection against phage predation. Alderaan infection was not impaired by spent medium of S. tenebrarius harvested after 1 day of cultivation. In contrast, cultivation in spent medium taken after 2 days completely reproduced the antiviral effect observed during experiments with supplemented purified apramycin, showing equivalent growth of infected and uninfected cultures (Fig.\u00a03a). Endpoint quantification of extracellular phage titers confirmed this inhibition of infection, as no more infective extracellular phages were detectable in the supernatants of the infected cultures (Fig.\u00a03b). Importantly, this protective effect of S. tenebrarius spent medium coincided with the presence of apramycin in cultures, as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Fig.\u00a03c). While the phage-inhibitory effect of the supernatants is very likely to be caused by the native levels of apramycin, we cannot exclude the possibility that this strain may produce other compounds with antiphage properties. Taken together, these data suggest that production of aminoglycoside antibiotics in natural environments might serve as a chemical defense providing protection against phage infection on a community level.", "FIG\u00a03Secondary metabolites produced by Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius inhibit phage infection.

We confirmed that this 15-min preincubation time was sufficient to reach the stage of irreversible adsorption of phage particles, as the control without apramycin showed strongly increasing titers following washing. Importantly, the outcome of phage amplification was determined only in the presence of apramycin in the main culture, as preincubation with apramycin had no influence on later phage titers. Taken together with the adsorption assay performed in the presence of apramycin (Fig.\u00a0S4a), these data suggest that apramycin does not inhibit irreversible adsorption but rather a later stage of the phage life cycle. In accordance with these findings, preincubation of phage particles with apramycin showed no impact on phage infectivity at physiologically relevant levels of 10 or 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL apramycin (Fig.\u00a0S5).

In the absence of apramycin, the phage DNA levels increased exponentially until 360\u2009min postinfection, indicating active genome replication across several rounds of infection (Fig.\u00a04b). Simultaneous measurement of extracellular phage titers showed stable titers until 120\u2009min, followed by a strong rise indicative of the release of new phage progeny after cells lysis (Fig.\u00a04c). Conversely, only a slight increase in intracellular DNA was obtained for infection under apramycin pressure (Fig.\u00a04b; note that measurement in the presence of apramycin is close to the detection limit). Relative phage concentrations then declined starting at 45\u2009min and were even similar to those measured in the uninfected controls at 360 and 450\u2009min, hinting at degradation of intracellular phage DNA. In the meantime, extracellular phage titers of apramycin-treated cultures declined from 120\u2009min (Fig.\u00a04c). Overall, these results suggest an inhibition of phage genome replication but do not exclude an interference with the injection process in S. venezuelae.", "Assuming that apramycin blocks an early step of phage infection prior to genome replication, addition of the antibiotic after the replication phase would not interfere with the infection. This hypothesis was indeed confirmed by supplementation of the aminoglycoside at different time points post infection (Fig.\u00a0S4b). Corresponding infection assays indicated that apramycin addition 30\u2009min after infection was sufficient to prevent a reproductive Alderaan infection. The observed decrease in extracellular phage titers is probably the result of adsorption and subsequent DNA injection of a fraction of phages without release of new infective viral particles.", "In contrast, no decrease in extracellular phage titers was observed when apramycin was added 1 to 2 h after infection, indicating that the first phages were able to complete their infection cycle before apramycin was added. Comparison of these results with the quantification of intracellular phage DNA (Fig.\u00a04b) further showed that this period corresponds to the replication phase, indicating that replication is a sensitive time point for the antiviral activity of aminoglycosides. In the case of the E. coli system, the measurement of potassium efflux is an established approach to probe the successful delivery of phage DNA into the bacterial cell (18). Applying this method to infection of E. coli with phage \u03bb confirmed that the injection process was not impaired by apramycin (Fig.\u00a0S2e).", "Next, we examined the influence of apramycin on phage DNA transcription. RNA sequencing revealed an increasing transcription of Alderaan DNA during phage infection under normal infection conditions, whereas addition of apramycin drastically hindered phage gene expression (Fig.\u00a04d and Fig.\u00a0S4c). In accordance with the previous results, these data suggest a blockage of phage infection prior to phage DNA replication and transcription, which is congruent with a recent report of inhibition of two mycobacteriophages by streptomycin, kanamycin, and hygromycin (19).", "To visualize intracellular phage infections in the presence and absence of apramycin, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization of phage DNA (phage-targeting direct-geneFISH) using Alexa Fluor 647-labeled probes specific for the phage genome. In this assay, the formation of bright and distinct fluorescent foci is indicative of advanced viral infections (20). When infecting E. coli with \u03bb, comparable amounts of injected phage DNA were detected for both infection conditions after 30\u2009min. This result is in line with the potassium efflux assay described above, which showed similar injection kinetics in the presence of apramycin for E. coli (Fig.\u00a0S2e). As the infection progressed, only samples without apramycin exhibited a strong increase in fluorescence intensity 90\u2009min and 180\u2009min postinfection, further hinting at an inhibited replication in the presence of apramycin (Fig.\u00a05a). For Alderaan, an increase in red fluorescence and thus intracellular phage DNA could be observed 4\u2009h after infection and was even more pronounced at 6\u2009h, reflecting phage DNA replication. In contrast, apramycin-treated samples showed only a very weak and more diffuse red fluorescent signal in the 6-h samples (Fig.\u00a05c), which is overall consistent with the quantification of intracellular phage DNA by qPCR (Fig.\u00a04b). Plotting the distribution of fluorescence intensity per pixel confirmed that the massive increase in fluorescence at the last time point (180\u2009min for \u03bb and 6 h for Alderaan, respectively) was inhibited in the presence of apramycin, supporting the blockage of replication exerted by apramycin (Fig.\u00a05b and d; Fig.\u00a0S6a and c). Interestingly, determination of the percentage of \u03bb-infected E. coli cells over time showed a peak at 30\u2009min in apramycin-treated samples followed by a decline down to almost no infected cell at 180\u2009min (Fig.\u00a0S6b).

LC-MS analysis of the reaction mixtures revealed complete acetylation of apramycin, as the peak of apramycin (m/z 540) disappeared in favor of the one corresponding to acetylated apramycin (m/z 582) (Fig.\u00a06b).", "The efficiency of the acetylation reaction being confirmed, we tested the effect of acetylated apramycin on phage infection in liquid medium, using wild-type S. venezuelae (not carrying a plasmid-borne acetyltransferase gene) and its phage Alderaan. As expected, apramycin fully prevented growth of S. venezuelae, while acetylated apramycin did not show any toxicity effect. Strikingly, phage infection was completely inhibited in the presence of acetylated apramycin, suggesting that acetylation of apramycin does not interfere with its antiphage properties (Fig.\u00a06c). Plate assays showed a comparable pattern: acetylation of apramycin suppressed its antibacterial effect but did not disrupt its ability to inhibit phage infection (Fig.\u00a06d). Altogether, these results suggest a decoupling of the antibacterial and antiphage properties of apramycin and further highlight the distinct molecular target accounting for apramycin\u2019s antiphage properties."]
