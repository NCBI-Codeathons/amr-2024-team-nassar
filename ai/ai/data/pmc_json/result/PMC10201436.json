["RESULTS", "The ABCF ARE1 subfamily member CplR is conserved in Clostridia", "While horizontally mobile ARE-ABCFs that are encoded in mobile genetic elements or plasmids mediate acquired antibiotic resistance, chromosomally-encoded ARE-ABCFs provide intrinsic antibiotic resistance and are likely to be predominantly inherited vertically. The three Gram-positive ARE-ABCF representatives characterised here\u2014CplR (standing for Clostridial pleuromutilin and lincosamide resistance; we propose this new name based on the resistance spectrum determined in the current study, see below), VmlR2 and Ard1\u2014are of the latter, intrinsic type. Despite this commonality, they belong to very different subfamilies of the ABCF family tree (Figure 1A). C. difficile CplR encoded by the gene CDIF630_02847 (RefSeq protein accession WP_011861613.1) is a member of the ARE1 subfamily, although it is phylogenetically distinct from the well-characterised mobile Vga- and Msr-like ARE1 proteins. CplR is found in a range of different Clostridia, including C. difficile, C. perfringens and C. sporogenes (Figure 1A). The core CplR group is found in various clostridia genera: Terrisporobacter, Clostridium, Clostridoides and Paeniclostridia (Supplementary Figure S3). However, there is a large diversity of CplR close relatives in bacillota, for which it is hard to establish orthology versus paralogy. The ARE2 subfamily of ABCFs can be subdivided into two phylogenetically distinct types: one subtype has a short \u2018arm\u2019 subdomain, as is seen in VmlR from B. subtilis (34), while the second form has insertions in the arm and \u2013 sometimes \u2013 the ARD/linker element, as is the case with Neobacillus vireti VmlR2 (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure S4). The Ard1 ABCF from Streptomyces capreolus is classified as being in the actinobacterial subfamily AAF1, closely related to ARE4 and ARE5 subfamilies (24). Just as with C. difficile CplR ARE-ABCF (54), Ard1 was originally mis-annotated as a transporter (52). While ABCF proteins do carry the ATP-binding cassette domain that is also found in many transmembrane transporters, they lack the necessary transmembrane domains for such a role. Ard1 is encoded as part of the A201A antibiotic biosynthesis gene cluster, acting as a self-resistance determinant (53).", "Figure 1.Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of selected ABCFs places CplR, Ard1 and VmlR2 in different clades of the ABCF family tree.

Only those 50% or higher are shown. CplR is a member of the ARE1 subfamily, but without any strongly supported specific association with Vga or Msr subtypes. There is strong support for Ard1 falling within the same clade as other actinomycete ARE subfamilies, all of which likely confer self-protection of the antibiotic producer.

This observation expands the spectrum of known VmlR-mediated resistance to nucleoside compounds. When B. subtilis VmlR is overexpressed in \u0394vmlR B. subtilis, the strain becomes PLSA- and nucleoside-resistant; no protective effect is detectable when an ATPase-deficient EQ2 variant of VmlR is expressed (Table 1). Expression of N. vireti VmlR2 confers the same PLSA and nucleoside resistance spectrum, despite the relatively long ARD, without any detectable resistance to macrolides (Table 1). Expression of S. capreolus Ard1 in Streptomyces lividuns is known to confer resistance to A201 (52), however no systematic characterisation of the Ard1 resistance spectrum was performed. The Phy-spank-driven expression of wild-type S. capreolus Ard1\u2014but not that of EQ2 Ard1\u2014confers \u0394vmlR B. subtilis moderate resistance to nucleoside\u2014but not PLSA\u2014antibiotics. The narrow spectrum of Ard1-mediated resistance suggests that Ard1 specifically confers self-resistance to A201A (Table 1). Finally, ectopic expression of C. difficile CplR confers \u0394vmlR B. subtilis resistance to PLSA antibiotics and has a moderate (2- to 4-fold increase in MIC) protective effect against nucleosides.", "Collectively, these results\u00a0(i) expand the resistance spectrum of ABCF-mediated resistance to nucleoside antibiotics, (ii) demonstrate that despite its relatively long ARD, N. vireti ARE2 VmlR has a PLSA and nucleoside resistance spectrum identical to that of the short-ARD B. subtilis ARE2 VmlR, (iii) establish S. capreolus Ard1 ARE-AAF1 as a dedicated narrow-spectrum nucleoside resistance factor and (iv) establish genome-encoded C. difficile ARE1 CplR as a PLSA resistance determinant.", "Cryo-EM structure of N. vireti VmlR2-70S complex", "Next, we aimed to determine cryo-electron microscopy structures of ribosome-bound ATPase-deficient (EQ2) C. difficile ARE1 CplR and N. vireti ARE2 VmlR2. To generate the ribosome-bound complexes we employed our well-established affinity purification strategy (26,33). While the C. difficile CplR structure would provide the necessary structural insights into intrinsic PLSA and nucleoside antibiotic resistance of C. difficile pathogen, the N. vireti VmlR structure would be instructive for structural rationalisation of the VmlR2N.vireti\u00a0resistance spectrum that is identical to that of short-ARD B. subtilis VmlR. S. capreolus Ard1 has not been prioritised for structural studies for two reasons: (i) the lack of established genetic tools for S. capreolus and (ii) the levels of nucleoside antibiotic resistance conferred in B. subtilis surrogate host are modest, indicative of imperfect functioning of the resistance determinant on the B. subtilis 70S ribosome.", "Unfortunately, our attempts to purify the FLAG3-tagged C. difficile CplR in complex with the ribosome were unsuccessful. As C-terminal FLAG3-tagging of C. difficile CplR abrogated the functionality of CplR in \u0394vmlR B. subtilis (Table 1; \u0394vmlR thrC::Physpank-cplRCd-FLAG3), we did not pursue this direction further. However, we were successful in isolating a complex of EQ2N. vireti VmlR2-HTF with B. subtilis 70S ribosomes (Supplementary Figure S1). The immunoprecipitated FLAG3-tagged EQ2 VmlR2 was eluted and applied to a cryo-EM grid for imaging in a Titan Krios followed by single-particle analysis using RELION (83). Three-dimensional classification revealed one major class of particles (72.3% of particles after 2D classification) consisting of VmlR2-EQ2 bound to the 70S ribosome (Supplementary Figure S2). This volume could be refined to an average resolution of 2.9 \u00c5 (Supplementary Figure S5A,\u00a0B). The VmlR2 NBDs and C-terminal extension (CTE) could be modelled by domain-wise fitting and adjustment of the AlphaFold2 model (Supplementary Figure S5C). While the density for the NBDs was not sufficient to draw conclusions about the precise geometry adopted by the catalytic region of the enzyme, the VmlR2 interdomain linker, consisting of two \u03b1 helices and a loop, and which extends into the core of the large ribosomal subunit, was well resolved and could be modelled de novo with high confidence (Supplementary Figure S5C). The VmlR2-70S structure is globally similar to other antibiotic resistance ABCF-70S complexes (26,33,34,41,43) (Figure 2A,\u00a0B). VmlR2-EQ2 is bound in the ribosomal E site with closed NBDs and density corresponding to two bound NTP molecules, presumably ATP (Figure 2A\u2013C, Supplementary Figure S6A,\u00a0B). The VmlR2 \u03b1-helical interdomain linker extends from the E site into the PTC, overlapping the canonical position of a P-site tRNA (Figure 2D,E). This results in a distorted tRNA occupying the P site, with the tRNA elbow contacting the VmlR2 NBD2, pulled towards the E site, and the acceptor stem highly distorted. Poor density for the P-tRNA acceptor stem indicates a high degree of flexibility in this region, and in particular the CCA-3\u2032 end could not be modelled (Supplementary Figure S6C).", "Figure 2.Cryo-EM structure of N. vireti VmlR2-EQ2 bound to the 70S ribosome.

An apparent Shine-Dalgarno\u2013anti-Shine-Dalgarno helix is positioned in the mRNA exit channel, close to, but not visibly contacting, the VmlR2 CTD (Supplementary Figure S6E). A sub-stoichiometric tRNA is present in the A site, as observed previously for the 70S-LsaA-EQ2 complex from Enterococcus faecalis, and sub-classification revealed that the A-site tRNA can adopt multiple conformations (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure S7). These observations imply that VmlR2-EQ2 had bound to and stalled the 70S ribosome after translation initiation, but before the first translocation event, which is the same state stalled by PLSA and nucleoside antibiotics (7,96).", "As expected from the high degree of sequence homology, the structure of VmlR2 bound to the 70S ribosome is globally similar to B. subtilis VmlR bound to the 70S, with a root square mean deviation (RMSD) of 1.44 \u00c5 between the two factors after least-squares fitting. In particular, the \u03b1-helices of the well-resolved interdomain linker, which travel through the path normally occupied by the P-tRNA to reach into the PTC, are highly structurally conserved (Figure 2D,\u00a0E). The ends of the \u03b1-helices and the ARD-loop linking them, diverge from the equivalent region in the B. subtilis VmlR (Figure 2E), as expected from the sequence alignment (Figure 1B). Compared to VmlR, the additional eight residues in the VmlR2 ARD are mostly oriented away from the PTC and drug binding site (Supplementary Figure S8A), similar to that observed for the ARDs of LsaA, VgaALC\u00a0and VgaL, which are also extended compared to B. subtilis VmlR despite sharing a similar spectrum of antibiotic resistance (Supplementary Figure S8B\u2013D) (26). Indeed, despite containing eight more amino acids than B. subtilis VmlR, the VmlR2 ARD reaches a similar site in the PTC as many other PLSA-specific ARE-ABCFs (Figure 2E, Supplementary Figure S8). Residue Ile261 of VmlR2 overlaps with the binding site of PLSA and nucleoside antibiotics, similarly to Phe237 of B. subtilis VmlR except inserted approximately 1.4 \u00c5 deeper into the PTC (Figure 2F, Supplementary Figure S9A\u2013H).", "We next mutated selected residues of the ARD-loop of VmlR2 to alanine and assessed the ability of the resulting VmlR2 variants to mediate antibiotic resistance in a \u0394vmlR B. subtilis background (Table 2). As observed for other antibiotic-resistance ABCFs, mutating the only residue that overlaps with the PLSA binding site, in this case Ile261 to alanine, did not appreciably shift the antibiotic resistance spectrum of VmlR2 (Table 1). However, due to the increased penetration of the VmlR2 ARD into the PTC, an alanine side chain at position 261 is also predicted to still overlap with the PLSA binding site (Supplementary Figure S9I\u2013K). Therefore, we next performed a more radical substitution and replaced Ile261 with glycine. The Ile261Gly substitution, which is predicted to remove overlap between VmlR2 and the drugs (Supplementary Figure S9L\u2013N), compromised the activity of VmlR2 against retapamulin and virginiamycin M1 but not against lincomycin and iboxamycin (Table 1). This antibiotic-specific loss of protective activity is reminiscent of the effect we have previously observed with the Phe237Val substitution in B. subtilis VmlR (34). We therefore conclude that while the Ile261 sidechain is not required for antibiotic resistance.", "Effects of CplR and Erm functionality on resistance of C. difficile to nucleoside and PLSA antibiotics", "MIC (\u03bcg/ml).", "C. difficile strain erm A201A Hygromycin A Retapamulin Lincomycin Clindamycin Iboxamycin Virginiamycin M1 Erythromycin Florfenicol.", "R20291 - 2 16 0.4 16 8 0.0625 128 >256 4.", "630 c-erm 4 16 0.4 >256 256 16 128 >256 4.", "630\u0394erm - 4 16 0.8\u20131.6 32 16 0.25 32 1 4.", "630\u0394erm \u0394cplR - 2 16 0.1 0.5 0.125 0.0156 16 1 4.", "630\u0394erm/pRFP185 - 1 8 0.2 16 4 0.03125 16 1 4.", "630\u0394erm \u0394cplR/pRFP185 - 1 4 0.05 0.25 0.03125 0.03125 8 1 4.", "630\u0394erm \u0394cplR/pRFP185-cplR - 2 8 1.6 32 8 <0.00781 16 1 4.", "630\u0394erm \u0394cplR /pRFP185-cplR\u0394C - 1 2 0.1 1 0.5 0.0625 8 1 4.", "C. difficile MIC testing was carried out in BHIS media, and growth inhibition was scored after 36\u201348 h of anaerobic incubation at 37\u00b0C. Plasmid-harboring strains were cultured in BHIS media supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/ml thiamphenicol (to maintain the plasmids) and 500 ng/ml anhydrotetracycline (to induce the expression of ARE-ABCF proteins).", "Mutation of other selected residues close to the drug-binding site resulted in a complex pattern of changes to antibiotic resistance (Supplementary Figure S10). Residues Arg259 and Gln260, positioned in the tip of the ARD, were insensitive to mutation to alanine despite making defined contacts with the 23S rRNA (Supplementary Figure S10A,\u00a0B). By contrast, VmlR2 Y266 was required for resistance to tiamulin and virginiamycin M. This residue is positioned similarly to B. subtilis VmlR Y240 and VgaALC Y223, with each residue stacking with 23S rRNA nucleotide U2585 (E. coli numbering; Figure 2G), and we previously found that a VgaALC Y223A variant also displayed reduced resistance against PLSA antibiotics (26). The adjacent residue, E265, also had a drastic effect on antibiotic resistance when mutated to alanine. E265 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of 23S rRNA residues A2450 and A2451, which form part of a region we have previously termed PTC loop 2 (PL2, Supplementary Figure S10C, (26)). Interactions between VmlR2 and the 23S rRNA in this region may serve to position the VmlR2 ARD in the PTC.", "Finally, we have truncated the very tip of the ARD including the above-mentioned Arg259 and Gln260. The \u0394254\u2013261 (\u0394SASERRQI) VmlR2 variant (Supplementary Figure S8A) displayed (albeit diminished) protective activity against all of the antibiotics tested, i.e. retapamulin, virginiamycin M1, iboxamycin and lincomycin. This result further reinforces the idea that VmlR2 acts allosterically to protect the ribosome.", "In summary, residues that interact with U2585 and A2450/A2451, located at the beginning of interdomain linker \u03b12, appear to be important for PLSA resistance mediated by VmlR2, while by contrast, mutating the residue that physically overlaps with the PLSA binding site or other residues in the extended tip of the ARD does not affect antibiotic resistance (Supplementary Figure S10C,D). These observations are consistent with previous mutagenesis studies of ARE-ABCFs (26,34). Previously, we proposed a model in which ARE-ABCFs confer antibiotic resistance by modulation of the antibiotic binding site (26,33,34). Similar to B. subtilis VmlR, VmlR2 modulates the conformation of several 23S rRNA nucleotides that form the PLSA binding site. In particular, nucleotides around A2451, part of PL2, are displaced in the VmlR2-bound structure compared to the antibiotic-bound structures or a stalled elongating ribosome (Figure 2H,I, Supplementary Figure S11). We therefore propose that binding of VmlR2 to a PLSA- or nucleoside-bound ribosome triggers a distortion of the antibiotic-binding site, in turn leading to dissociation of the antibiotic and ultimately allowing translation to resume after dissociation of the ARE-ABCF.", "CplR contributes to intrinsic PLSA resistance in Clostridia", "Next, we characterised the resistance mediated by C. difficile, C. perfringens and C. sporogenes CplR in the native bacterial hosts.", "In our C. difficile antibiotic sensitivity experiments we used two strains: the erm- R20291 and the erm\u00a0+\u00a0630. R20291 is an epidemic hypervirulent strain that belongs to PCR-ribotype 027 (97). The MIC values determined with this strain are directly comparable with erm- ATCC 700057 MICs reported by Mitcheltree and colleagues in the original iboxamycin study (12). Despite encoding a genomic copy of CplR, both R20291 and ATCC 700057 are sensitive to iboxamycin (MIC of 0.0625 \u03bcg/ml for R20291, MIC of 0.25 \u03bcg/ml for ATCC 700057 (12)) (Table 2).", "The C. difficile 630 wild-type reference strain is a clinical isolate that over the years gained popularity with the research community (98). The prophage region of the mobilizable, non-conjugative transposon Tn5398 present in the genome of C. difficile 630 encodes a tandem expression cassette for two identical copies of the ermB gene for rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase (55). This ubiquitous antibiotic resistance determinant confers resistance to macrolides as well as lincomycin and clindamycin (99,100). Compared to wild-type 630, the \u0394erm 630 C. difficile is more sensitive to pleuromutilin retapamulin (MIC for of 0.4 \u03bcg/ml vs 1.6 \u03bcg/ml) as well as lincosamides (MIC for lincomycin of 16 \u03bcg/ml vs\u00a0>\u00a0256 \u03bcg/ml, MIC for clindamycin of 16 \u03bcg/ml versus 256 \u03bcg/ml and MIC for iboxamycin of 0.25 \u03bcg/ml vs 16 \u03bcg/ml) (Table 2). Since in B. subtilis VmlR synergises with Cfr to grant high levels of resistance (48), we next tested the effects of CplR loss in \u0394erm 630 C. difficile. The strain is further sensitised to lincosamides (MIC for lincomycin, clindamycin and iboxamycin of 0.1, 0.5 and\u00a0<0.125 \u03bcg/ml, respectively) as well as virginiamycin M1 (MIC of 16 \u03bcg/ml) but not florfenicol or hygromycin A. The effect of CplR expression on nucleoside resistance is minor: a mere 2-fold increase in sensitivity to A201A, and no effect on sensitivity to hygromycin A (Table 2, compare 630\u0394erm \u0394cplR to 630\u0394erm as well as 630\u0394erm \u0394cplR/pRFP185 to 630\u0394erm \u0394cplR/pRFP185-cplR).

Conversely, ectopic overexpression of CplRCp from the pJIR 750 vector in the \u0394cplR background drastically increased the MICs against retapamulin, lincomycin, clindamycin and iboxamycin, exceeding that of the wild-type HN13 C. perfringens by 8-fold (Table 3).", "Effects of CplR functionality on C. perfringens resistance to PLSA and macrolide antibiotics", "MIC (\u03bcg/ml).", "C. perfringens strain erm A201A Hygromycin A Retapamulin Lincomycin Clindamycin Iboxamycin Virginiamycin M1 Erythromycin.", "wt/pJIR750 - 4 4 0.8 4 2 0.0156 3.2 1.", "\u0394cplR/pJIR750 - 4 4 0.025 0.25 <0.0625 0.0078 1.6 1.", "\u0394cplR/pJIR750-cplR - 8 8 12.8 32 16 0.125 3.2 1.", "The MIC test for C. perfringens was carried out in GAM media and the growth inhibition was scored after 24 h of anaerobic incubation at 37\u00b0C.

To deconvolute the effect of the introduced ermB gene on antibiotic resistance from that of cplRCs disruption, we also constructed a strain in which the intron-ermB marker is introduced into the sigD locus. Compared to the isogenic wild type, the cplR::intron-ermB strain is more sensitive to retapamulin (MICs of 0.025 \u03bcg/ml versus 25.6 \u03bcg/ml, Table 4) suggesting that CplR mediates resistance to pleuromutilins.

At the same time, the cplR::intron-ermB strain is more sensitive to iboxamycin (MICs of 0.031 \u03bcg/ml versus 0.125 \u03bcg/ml), consistent with the role of CplR in lincosamide resistance. The antibiotic resistance function of ClpR\u00a0is further supported by the clindamycin and iboxamycin MIC of the cplR-disrupted mutant being lower than that of the sigD mutant (compare cplR:intron-ermB to sigD::intron-ermB: clindamycin MICs of 8 \u03bcg/ml vs 128 \u03bcg/ml, iboxamycin MICs of 0.031 \u03bcg/ml versus 16 \u03bcg/ml) (Table 4). Finally, the effects on nucleoside antibiotic sensitivity are minor (2-fold increased sensitivity to hygromycin B, and no effect on sensitivity to A201A).", "Taken together, our results establish ARE1 CplR as a clostridial\u00a0genome-encoded PLSA resistance determinant and suggest that high PLSA resistance levels of C. difficile 630 are mediated through a combined action of direct ribosome protection by CplR and 23S rRNA modification by the ErmB methyltransferase.", "An antibiotic challenge induces the accumulation of C. difficilecplR full-length mRNA, and expression is re-repressed once bacterial growth is restored", "Expression of ARE-ABCFs is typically induced upon a sub-MIC antibiotic challenge through a de-repression mechanism, with the full-length mRNA levels being kept low in the absence of the cognate antibiotic due to premature transcription termination in the absence of ribosomal stalling on a regulatory uORF (27\u201332).", "Genome-wide mapping of transcriptional start sites (TSSs; identified using dRNA-seq) and termination sites (TTSs; identified using RNAtag-seq) in C. difficile 630 (54) revealed that i) the cplR ORF preceded by a 212 nucleotide-long 5\u2032\u00a0upstream region (CDIF630nc_084), and that ii) as expected for an ARE-ABCF, under non-inducing conditions, the transcript prematurely terminates at start codon of the cplR ORF (CDIF630_02847) (Figure 3A). Since antibiotic-induced ribosomal stalling by a regulatory uORF is a common regulatory strategy employed for inducible control of ARE-ABCF expression (27\u201332), we have mounted an in silico search for regulatory ORFs of CplR and close relatives using our bioinformatic tool for uORF detection, uORF4u (61). Sequence conservation analysis reveals that the uORF of Clostridial CplR has a consensus of MR[I/M], with C. difficile cplR uORF specifically encoding Met-Arg-Ile (Figure 3B,\u00a0C). The consensus is different from the uORF4u-computed uORF for VmlR (MIN, Figure 3C), VmlR2 (MK[L/Q], Figure 3D) and LsaA (MAGN, Figure 3F), despite the four ARE-ABCFs having similar resistance spectra. The identified short uORFs are likely to be stalled by PLSA and nucleoside antibiotics, which inhibit translation after initiation with little context-specificity (7,96). We could not identify an adequate number of sufficiently closely related homologues for the tool to be able to predict any conserved uORFs for Ard1.", "Figure 3.Nucleotide sequence and predicted secondary structures of the 5\u2032 leader region of cplR mRNA in induced and repressed conformations.

In the repressed conformation the 5\u2032\u00a0cplR leader region is predicted to form two stable stem loop structures (Figure 3G). The 5\u2032\u00a0hairpin sequesters the putative regulatory uORF(MRI). The 3\u2032\u00a0terminator hairpin is followed by a single-stranded polyU stretch, thus constituting a canonical signal for efficient intrinsic termination in bacteria (102\u2013105). Importantly, the stem loop of the terminator hairpin sequesters the Shine-Dalgarno element positioned to drive the expression of the cplR ORF, potentially mediating the suppression of the cplR expression from full-length mRNA transcripts that fail to terminate prematurely. In repressed conformation the terminator hairpin is not formed, with an anti-terminator stem loop formed instead which allows transcription of full-length mRNA (Figure 3H). Furthermore, the Shine-Dalgarno that drives the cplR expression is readily accessible for initiating ribosomes (Figure 3D).", "To test antibiotic-inducible expression of C. difficile cplR, we cultured 630\u0394ermR C. difficile in the presence of increasing sub-MIC concentrations of retapamulin (2\u2013200 ng/ml; MIC of 800\u20131600 ng/ml) and lincomycin (0.02\u20132.0 \u03bcg/ml; MIC of 32 \u03bcg/ml) and assessed the levels of cplR mRNA by RT-PCR using two primer pairs: one amplifying 5\u2032 leader region and the other targeting the ORF (Figure 4A).

We hypothesised that when the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic on translation is relieved by the ARE-ABCF, the expression of the factor should subside as the antibiotic-induced ribosomal stalling that drives the expression is abolished. To test this hypothesis, we contrasted the RT-PCR data with bacterial growth kinetics. The cplR expression quickly responded to the antibiotic challenge, peaking within 30 min after the addition of antibiotics (Figure 4C, left). Importantly, while the retapamulin-induced growth inhibition was severe and persisted for the whole duration of the experiment, the lincomycin-induced growth inhibition is much milder and at the later time points the growth kinetics are similar to that one the untreated control (Figure 4C, right). Consistent with the prediction, while in the presence of 200 ng/ml retapamulin the maximal levels of cplR mRNA are maintained throughout the 6 h of the RT-PCR time course, but the cplR mRNA levels gradually decreased as bacterial growth \u2013 and, by inference, protein synthesis \u2013 has recovered from the lincomycin challenge (Figure 4C, left).", "Collectively, our results suggest that (i) inhibition of translation by retapamulin or lincomycin induces accumulation of cplR mRNA and (ii) induction of cplR mRNA is abrogated once expression of the factor overcomes the drug-induced translation inhibition.", "The 5\u2032 leader region of cplR controls the induction of ABCF expression upon an antibiotic challenge", "To test the role of the predicted 5\u2032\u00a0cplR leader region elements in antibiotic-induced expression of cplR in C. difficile we used a series of reporter constructs in which the expression of the mCherry red fluorescent protein was driven by the native cplR promoter (PcplR) with either wild-type or mutated 5\u2032\u00a0leader variants (Figure 5A).

The muttermSL reporter in which premature transcription termination is ablated and the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) element that drives expression of cplR is made directly accessible for translation initiation is (i) constitutively active and non-responsive to addition of antibiotics, and (ii) the fluorescent signal is >10-fold higher than that of the fully induced wild-type 5\u2032\u00a0leader reporter construct (Figure 5C, D). By contrast, the expression of mCherry from the mutpolyU reporter is (i) tightly regulated by antibiotics, with only very weak signal detectable in the absence of retapamulin, (ii) in the presence of retapamulin, the fluorescent signal was about twice (2.3-fold) as strong as that in the case of the wild-type reporter (Figure 5C). In the case of the mutpolyU reporter the full-length mRNA is expected to be constitutively produced (just as in the case of muttermSL). Our RT-PCR experiments directly support this prediction: in good agreement with consistent production of the mutpolyU reporter mRNA, the maximum induced signal is higher for the mutpolyU reporter than for the wild-type reporter (Figure 5B). At the same time, the cplR SD element is expected\u2014just as in the wild-type reporter\u2014to be accessible only upon ribosomal stalling on the uORF, and, evidently, translational attenuation is sufficient to ensure the suppression of cplR expression in the absence of antibiotic.", "Collectively, our results establish that translational attenuation and transcriptional attenuation synergise to control the inducible expression of CplR in C. difficile."]
