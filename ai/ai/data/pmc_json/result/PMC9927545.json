["RESULTS", "Antimicrobial resistance in a pristine environment.", "We characterized the resistomes of GFS epilithic biofilms and assessed the distribution of AMR in twenty-one epilithic biofilm samples, across 8 individual glaciers originating from the Southern Alps in New-Zealand (SA1, SA2, SA3, and SA4) and the Caucasus in Russia (CU1, CU2, CU3, CU4). In total, we identified a high number (n\u2009=\u20091,840) of ARGs within 29 categories of AMR, with similar AMR profiles observed across all GFSs (Fig.\u00a01a), except for CU1, CU2, and SA3, where the differences were driven by elevated fluoroquinolone, peptide, glycopeptide, and phenicol resistance (Fig. S1). It is to be noted that while ARGs refer to the genes encoding specific resistance, AMR categories derived from metagenomic data in this context, typically reflect the functional potential associated with respect to the resistance encoded. Of the identified AMR categories, beta-lactam and multidrug resistance (i.e., resistance conferring protection against multiple antibiotic classes), followed by aminoglycoside resistance, were found to be highly abundant in all samples. We subsequently analyzed the diversity of ARGs within the various resistance categories and found beta-lactam resistance to represent the largest resistance category, contributing 930 unique ARGs to the resistome. This was followed by multidrug (179 ARGs) and aminoglycoside (176 ARGs) resistance (Table S2). In contrast, some resistance categories such as polymyxin and pleuromutilin resistance were only detected at very low levels within the epilithic biofilm resistomes.", "FIG\u00a01Epilithic biofilms in GFSs harbor a diverse resistome.

Prokaryotes within this study refer to bacteria alone, since archaea encoded an infinitesimal number of ARGs (<0.000001% RNum_GI; see Materials and Methods.), and therefore were excluded from further analyses. Among the eukaryotes, the phylum Ochrophyta (algae) was the dominant contributor and encoded most of the AMR categories (Fig.\u00a01c; Fig. S2a). In bacteria, AMR was more evenly distributed, with most of the phyla encoding ARGs across all categories (Fig.\u00a01c). However, members of the Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group encoded the highest overall ARG abundance (Fig.\u00a01c; Fig. S2b). Additionally, AMR categories such as aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, glycopeptide, and rifamycin resistance (among others) were widely distributed in both bacteria as well as among the eukaryotes. On the other hand, categories such as aminocoumarin, bacitracin, and diaminopyrimidine resistance were found to be primarily encoded by bacteria.", "Given the novelty of the identification of putative ARGs in eukaryotes, we applied additional checks to validate the ARG sequences. First, the eukaryotic ARG sequences were assessed for homology with known bacterial representatives from the CARD database. For example, both TETA (tetracycline) and ERM (MLS phenotype) sequences were the most representative for ARGs in ~95% of the eukaryotic MAGs and were therefore retrieved from the eukaryotic contigs. Additionally, these genes were chosen for assessment given the availability of different isoforms in CARD. Phylogenetic analyses subsequently revealed that several of the eukaryotic-encoded ARGs indeed shared considerable homology with their bacterial counterparts (Fig.\u00a02), as identified by their grouping within clades. A similar phenomenon was observed when comparing the ARGs retrieved from the GFS bacteria with the CARD reference ARGs (Fig. S3). Interestingly, several eukaryotic ARGs were distantly related, raising the hypothesis that they may be naturally occurring enzymes that may be distantly related homologs of the reference ARGs. To account for this possibility, all the ARG sequences from the eukaryotes were compared against the UniProtKB database (Fig. S4a and Table S3). With both TETA and ERM, we found that a majority (>73%) of the prokaryotic ARGs had hits in the database with at least 50% identity covering 90% of the total sequence length. Only ~8% of the eukaryotic ARGs demonstrated 50% identity with the database sequences, albeit with high E values suggesting poor or partial homology with existing reference sequences. We manually verified the partially homologous sequences from eukaryotic TETA resistance genes and found weak homology (<58%) to the existing list of entries in UniProtKB (representative example: Fig. S4b). Among the amino acids with substantial homology in terms of their positions, we found that 141 to 159 aa from the TETA genes found in UniProtKB were partially homologous with those of the eukaryotes\u2019 TETA genes. Nevertheless, it is at present unclear whether these amino acids form the active sites conferring tetracycline resistance. Due to the lack of functional information, we additionally used fARGene (24) to determine the likelihood that functional resistance genes were encoded by these genes and to subsequently classify any novel antibiotic resistance genes. Although fARGene classified and identified all bacterial ARGs, eukaryote-encoded ARGs were unclassified, likely due to their novelty or the lack of appropriate representatives in the database underlying fARGene.", "FIG\u00a02Phylogenetic analyses of putative eukaryotic ARGs.

Group in both figures indicates the origins of the sequence, i.e., CARD database or eukaryote.", "Antibiotic biosynthesis pathways and biosynthetic gene clusters.", "As described above, beta-lactam, multidrug, and aminoglycoside resistance were the most abundant resistance categories within GFS epilithic biofilms. This was not surprising as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides are natural and prevalent compounds (25, 26). Furthermore, multidrug resistance is typically conferred via efflux machineries which were also common in the GFS epilithic biofilms. These typically serve dual purposes in particular for protein export within most bacteria (27). Based on these results, it is therefore likely that pristine environments such as GFSs potentially reflect the spectrum of natural antibiotics and their resistance mechanisms, reinforcing their capacity to serve as natural baselines for assessing enrichments and spread of AMR.", "To further understand if these encoded resistance genes reflected natural antibiotic pressure, we investigated pathways associated with antibiotic biosynthesis using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database (28). In total, we identified seven different pathways corresponding to the biosynthesis of macrolides (MLS), ansamycins, glycopeptides (vancomycin), beta-lactams (monobactam, penicillin, and cephalosporin), aminoglycosides (streptomycin), and tetracyclines, which were present in various abundances in all samples (Fig. S5a). Importantly, the identified antibiotic synthesis genes thereby corresponded to the resistance categories identified within the epilithic biofilms. Interestingly, in most of the GFSs, antibiotic biosynthesis was primarily encoded by bacteria spanning multiple phyla (Fig. S5b, c). Exceptions to these were GL11 and GL15 in which biosynthesis pathways were equally distributed among eukaryotes, specifically Ochrophyta, in addition to bacteria.", "KEGG pathways described for the production of certain antibiotics tend to contain enzymes involved in far-upstream reactions. For example, the \u201cstreptomycin biosynthesis\u201d pathway in KEGG ortholog (ko00521) is defined with 21 KOs, including general and widespread genes such as glucose metabolism. Therefore, to further validate our observations regarding the antibiotic biosynthesis pathways, we assessed the abundance of BGCs, in the epilithic bioficlms within the MAGs, that are known to encode genes for secondary metabolite synthesis, including antibiotics. We found six different structural classes of BGCs by annotating 537 medium-to-high-quality (>50% completion and <10% contamination) bacterial and 30 eukaryotic MAGs using antiSmash (29) and DeepBGC (30). Using this ensemble approach, we identified one or more BGCs in most bacterial (n\u2009=\u2009490, ~91% of all bacterial MAGs) and eukaryotic (n\u2009=\u200928) MAGs. Of these BGCs, those annotated with an antibacterial function were dominant across the microbial populations, represented here by the MAGs, and were found across all phyla (Fig.\u00a03a). Overall, a wider variety of BGCs associated with cytotoxic activity, inhibitory, and antifungal mechanisms were also identified in bacteria. Eukaryotes, on the other hand, encoded a high prevalence of antibacterial BGCs (~93% of all eukaryotic MAGs) (Fig.\u00a03a). We further annotated those BGCs identified as antibacterial to determine their subtypes and found that most of them were \u201cunknown\u201d (Fig.\u00a03b). However, other identified subtypes include ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) such as bacteriocins, along with NRPs, PKs, and terpenes. In line with the abundance of aminoglycoside and beta-lactamase resistance genes, we found that ~19 of the MAGs encoded beta-lactamase gene clusters, while ~15% encoded aminoglycoside-associated BGCs, followed by BGCs of \u201cunknown\u201d classification.", "FIG\u00a03Biosynthetic gene clusters indicate the resistome potential.

(d) Genome plots indicating the location of the ARGs in relation to the biosynthetic gene clusters.", "According to the resistance hypothesis (14), within or close to each BGC there is at least one gene conferring resistance to its encoded secondary metabolite. To test this, we assessed whether the MAGs encoding a BGC also encoded corresponding ARGs. In line with this hypothesis, we identified BGCs and their respective resistance genes in close proximity to each other through their localization on the same contig. Consequently, we identified various BGCs encoded together with ARGs in both the bacterial and eukaryotic MAGs. For example, we found that an antibacterial BGC was encoded by Flavobacterium spp. on the same contig as both MLS (i.e., macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin) and beta-lactam resistance genes (Fig.\u00a03c). Incidentally, we also found that a candidate phyla radiation (CPR) bacterium (Aalborg-AAW-1; phylum Patescibacteria) also encoded both antibacterial BGC and MLS resistance on the same contig. Further closer inspection revealed that the ARGs were encoded within the BGCs in certain cases, while in other instances the ARGs directly flanked the BGC itself (Fig.\u00a03d). Importantly, we found that the closely encoded ARGs and BGCs were localized within a distance of 100\u2009bp to 2 Kb of each other."]
