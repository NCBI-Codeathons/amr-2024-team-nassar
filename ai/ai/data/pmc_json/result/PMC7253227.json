Melanin is produced starting from oxidation of amino acid L-Tyrosine. With our mass spectrometry techniques, it is possible to identify the tyrosine metabolism intermediates. The rate-limiting initial step in the biosynthesis of melanin is the hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and its immediate subsequent oxidation to DOPAquinone (DQ). Dopaquinone went through instantaneous intramolecular nonenzymatic cyclization forming leucochrome, which is rapidly oxidized by dopaquinone to dopachrome at the level of DOPAquinone point of switch. The pathway lead to the synthesis of melanin instead of cysteinyl DOPA. Since all the intermediates (leucoDOPAchrome, DOPAchrome, 5\u20136 dihydroxy indole, Indole 5,6 quinone) reached the maximum level in south exposed samples (p < 0.05), we have considered the melanin biosynthesis significantly enhanced in southern exposed rocks.", "10.1371/journal.pone.0233805.g005Fig 5Melanin synthesis pathway.The conversion of tyrosine to melanin involves several steps and we found overall up-regulation of Finger Mt. south intermediates whereas Cysteinyl DOPA decreases, confirming that samples from south increase the synthesis of melanin.
