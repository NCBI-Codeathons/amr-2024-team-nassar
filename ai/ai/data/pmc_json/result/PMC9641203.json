["Results", "edeB encodes a putative ParB family protein", "The protein EdeB (Genebank accession: ATF13884.1) encoded by the edeB gene consists of 256 amino acids with a molecular weight of 30.4 kDa. Bioinformatics analyses showed that EdeB protein was a member of the ParB family proteins, and the N-terminal of EdeB contained a SnbI_like domain (\nFigure\u00a01B\n). PROSITE analysis identified a number of functional sites in EdeB, including Protein kinase C phosphorylation, N-myristoylation, and N-glycosylation, and Casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (\nFigure\u00a01C\n). The amino acid sequences of EdeB and three homologs of ParB family proteins from other bacterial species were aligned and reviewed using the Jalview software. The results showed that EdeB was a member of the ParB family proteins with highly conserved sequences (\nFigure\u00a01D\n).", "Disruption of edeB significantly reduced edeine biosynthesis and inhibited the antibacterial activity of B. brevis X23", "In order to explore the role of edeB in edeine biosynthesis, the edeB gene was replaced by apramycin resistance gene through Red/ET homologous recombination, and the mutant was named as X23 (\u0394edeB)-apra. Then the Cre enzyme plasmid was transferred into X23 (\u0394edeB)-apra to finally obtain B. brevis X23(\u0394edeB) strain through removing the Aprar (\nFigure\u00a02A\n). We compared the cell growth curves of wild-type strain B. brevis X23, edeB-deletion mutant X23(\u0394edeB), complementary strain X23(\u0394edeB)(PAD-Apr-Px-edeB) in NB fermentation medium. The results showed that no significant difference in the cell growth curves was detected among the wild-type B. brevis X23, X23 (\u0394edeB), and X23(\u0394edeB)(PAD-Apr-Px-edeB).

The results showed that the inhibition zone of X23 (\u0394edeB) was significantly smaller than that of the wild-type B. brevis X23. The inhibition zone of the X23 (\u0394edeB) (PAD-Apr-Px-edeB) was significantly larger than that of wild-type B. brevis X23 (\nFigures\u00a02C, D\n). Taken together, edeB disruption significantly inhibited the antibacterial activity of B. brevis X23.", "To further explore the effect of EdeB on edeine biosynthesis, HPLC-MS was used to compare edeine production among wild-type B. brevis strain X23, X23 (\u0394edeB), and X23 (\u0394edeB) (PAD-Apr-Px-edeB). The results showed that X23 (\u0394edeB) still produced edeines, but the yield of edeine A and B decreased by 17.67% and 16.16%, respectively, compared with wild-type B. brevis strain X23. edeB gene complementation increased the yields of edeine A and B in X23 (\u0394edeB) (PAD-Apr-Px-edeB) by 20.88% and 13.53%, respectively, compared with wild-type B. brevis X23 (\nFigure\u00a03\n).

Greater than 2.0 or less than 0.5 means that the transcription level of the target gene is significantly increased or decreased. The RT-qPCR results showed that the transcription level of edeA, edeQ, and edeK in X23(\u0394edeB) significantly decreased compared with that in the wild-type B. brevis X23, suggesting that EdeB was a positive regulator in edeine biosynthesis (\nFigure\u00a04\n).", "Figure\u00a04Effects of edeB gene knockout on the transcription levels of edeA, edeQ, and edeK. * statistically significant difference.", "Effects of edeB gene knockout on the transcription levels of edeA, edeQ, and edeK. * statistically significant difference.", "Bioinformatics analysis of the main elements of promoter edepro in ede BGC", "The ede BGC promoter (~200 bp), namely edePro, has been previously identified and characterized (Liu et\u00a0al., 2022). Bioinformatic analyses identified a -10 and -35 region in the sequence of ede BGC promoter edePro (\nFigure\u00a05A\n). The transcriptional factor binding site (TFBS) sequences were involved in binding with transcription factors Crp (cAMP receptor protein) and arcA (Arginine deiminase).

In order to study whether EdeB regulates edeine biosynthesis through the same way, EMSA was used to evaluate the binding ability of EdeB with the promoter region of ede BGC. The results showed that EdeB inhibited the migration of promoter fragment edePro, suggesting that EdeB directly interact with ede BGC. The interaction between EdeB and ede BGC was further confirmed (\nFigure\u00a06\n).
