As a possible solution, it has been reported that metal-resistant bacteria/fungi inhabiting plant-related sphere have the ability to promote plant growth and tolerance upon the attack of toxic metal stress (Mishra et\u00a0al., 2017; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2020), forming plant-microbe interactions which might also provide an opportunity for plants to acquire metal-resistant genes originated from nearby microbial taxa. In accordance, we identified eleven HGT gene entries for metal resistance in the tested plant genomes (\nTable\u00a02\n), most of which are metal ion transport proteins (e.g., ChrA, CopA, CorA) that facilitate the efflux of cytosolic excessed toxic metal ions. Other HGT genes related to metal resistance might include phosphatase (\nTable\u00a02\n), which might be secreted to increase soil phosphorus availability and immobilize toxic metal ions by forming complex compounds with them (Bechtaoui et\u00a0al., 2021).", "To confirm the HGT origin of the mentioned plant metal resistance genes, we selected and built the phylogenetic trees with three representative genes as queries: chromate transporters (ChrA) of Ricinus communis, copper homeostasis protein (CutC) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and magnesium and cobalt transport protein (CorA) of Volvox carteri. As expected, all these suggested HGT genes in plant genomes are clustering with homologues of cross-phylum microbial taxa (putative HGT donors). To be specific, it is illustrated in the well-supported phylogenetic tree constructed with not-exclusive top BLASTP hit entries that: ChrA of Ricinus communis (eudicots) and several green algae (e.g., Chlorella spp., Chlamydomonas spp., Coccomyxa spp.) bear significant resemblance to the homologues of vast Proteobacteria and Firmicutes lineages (e.g., Methylophilus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Bacillales) (\nFigure\u00a01A\n); CutC homologues of green algae (e.g., Chlamydomonas spp., Volvox spp., Klebsormidium nitens) are completely nested within in bacterial taxa (e.g., Verrucomicrobiales, Bacteroidales, Rhizobiaceae), a pattern indicative of cross-kingdom HGT (\nFigure\u00a01B\n); besides, CorA homologues of green algae (e.g., Chlamydomonas spp., Scenedesmus spp., Volvox spp.) are closely clustering with fungal lineages (e.g., Colletotrichum spp., Spizellomyces spp., Kwoniella spp.) (\nFigure\u00a01C\n). Lastly, phosphatase homologues of green algae (e.g., Chlamydomonas spp., Ostreobium spp., Micromonas spp.) are clustering adjacent to bacterial taxa (e.g., Sphingomonas spp., Zoogloea spp., Pseudomonadales), indicating strong HGT signals (\nFigure\u00a01D\n).", "Figure\u00a01Phylogenetic tree of metal resistance proteins in plant genomes originated from microbial taxa.

(D) phosphatase.", "Osmotic and drought stress resistance", "Salinization and drought of arable land stand for major challenges to agriculture production worldwide. Salt accumulation and water scarcity would cause osmotic and water-deficit stress that restrict plant growth by affecting nutrient uptake and cell physiology (Bashir et\u00a0al., 2014; Hanin et\u00a0al., 2016). Acquisitions of osmotic and drought stress resistance genes from nearby microbes to enhance self-resistance might be an alleviating approach for plants. Accordingly, we found ten gene entries that putatively confer osmotic stress resistance in five tested plant genomes (\nTable\u00a02\n): eight ion/solute transporter (e.g., sodium/potassium ATPase, Na+/proline symporter, chloride channel protein and potassium/proton antiporter) and two organic osmolyte biosynthesis enzymes (choline dehydrogenase BetA and sarcosine oxidase SoxA). These genes are correspondent to two mechanisms of osmotic stress resistance: maintaining cellular ion homeostasis and recruitment of compatible solutes (e.g., proline, betaine, sarcosine) to stabilize proteins. These compatible solutes can also protect against drought, heat or cold stresses (Bashir et\u00a0al., 2014; Hanin et\u00a0al., 2016). Other putative HGT and osmotic/drought resistance genes detected in plants, as listed in \nTable\u00a02\n, may include: trehalose 6-phosphate synthase and trehalose hydrolase, and dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB), involving in the biosynthesis of protective sugar; cellulose synthase, significant for enhanced cell wall (Behr et\u00a0al., 2015). Besides, we have found in the plant genomes HGT-driven malate synthase and isocitrate lyase of the glyoxylate cycle, which were reported to be highly expressed under drought conditions (Todaka et\u00a0al., 2015; Kim et\u00a0al., 2020); Lastly, transaldolase, an upstream enzyme controlling erythritol (protectant) production, which was found up-regulated upon exposure to short-term drought stress (Liu et\u00a0al., 2015) and hyper-osmotic stress (Iwata et\u00a0al., 2015; Yang et\u00a0al., 2015).", "To further verify the occurrence of HGT on the plant stress resistance genes mentioned above, we chose and built the phylogenetic trees of three representative genes: sodium/proton antiporter (CPA1) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Na+/solute symporter from Arabidopsis thaliana, chloride channel protein (ClcA) and dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB) from Chlorella variabilis (\nFigure\u00a02\n). As observed from the well-supported phylogenetic tree of CPA1, homologues from Chlamydomonas spp. are tightly clustering with CPA1 from fungi (e.g., Basidiobolus, Rhizophagus, Actinomortierella), and remotely with CPA1 from cyanobacteria and actinobacteria (\nFigure\u00a02A\n). Likewise, the well-supported phylogenetic tree of Na+/solute symporter placed green algae/plant homologues (e.g., Scenedesmus, Coccomyxa, and Klebsormidium) in the vicinity of those of fungi (e.g., Batrachochytrium, Podila, Mortierella) (\nFigure\u00a02B\n). Similarly, in the well-supported phylogenetic tree of ClcA (\nFigure\u00a02C\n), homologues from Chlorella spp. (green algae) clustering with several homologues of other green algae (e.g., Chlamydomonas, Micractinium), are embedded in branches derived from archaeal taxa of phylum Euryarchaeota (Methanobacteriales, Methanomassiliicoccales) and high G+C Gram-positive bacterial taxa (e.g., Pseudonocardia spp., Mumia spp. and Microbacterium spp.), suggesting the occurrence of cross-phylum HGT. Finally, the phylogenetic tree of RmlB indicates that Chlorella virus Acanthocystis turfacea has facilitated the transitions of RmlB encoding genes (\nFigure\u00a02D\n), in consistence with previous studies (Parakkottil et\u00a0al., 2010).", "Figure\u00a02Phylogenetic tree of osmotic and drought stress resistance proteins in plant genomes originated from microbial taxa.

To cope with such conditions, gene inventions and expansions of heat/cold shock factor gene families into plant genomes are constantly happening during adaptive evolution (Wang et\u00a0al., 2018; Li et\u00a0al., 2021). In this study, we have also detected in tested plant genomes a wide range (26 gene entries) of microbial-originated HGT gene families related to heat/cold shock response (\nTable\u00a02\n), which mainly function as transcription factors and molecular chaperones regulated by the former, working corporately to maintain cellular protein homeostasis (Andr\u00e1si et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition, it is reported that chitinase is also involved in plants\u2019 cold and osmotic stress responses (Cao et\u00a0al., 2019), and correspondingly, HGT gene entries encoding chitinases are also detected (\nTable\u00a02\n). In addition, we have discovered HGT genes encoding ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit (Rubisco), carbonic anhydrase (CA), and photosystem II proteins putatively acquired from Bacteria (\nTable\u00a02\n). It is possible that plants might depend on generating more photosynthesis-related protein copies as a remedy strategy to cope with the impaired CO2-fixing efficiency resulted from malfunction of heat-liable Rubisco under heat-stress conditions (Nouri et\u00a0al., 2015).", "As before, we chose and performed phylogenetic analyses on several such genes to illustrate the likely evolutionary path. The first gene query is heat-shock protein DnaJ, which is reported to protect Rubisco activity under heat stress (Wang et\u00a0al., 2015). As expected, we found that DnaJ proteins from a group of green algae (e.g., Chlamydomonas, Tetrabaena, Edaphochlamys, Volvox) and eudicots (Erigeron canadensis) (\nFigure\u00a03A\n, marked with green color) are placed just next to homologues from bacterial lineages (e.g., Phycisphaerae, Anaerolineae, Pseudanabaenaceae). The second tested gene is heat shock protein Hsp20 (\nFigure\u00a03B\n). Likewise, a group of green algae (e.g., Chlorella, Micractinium, Scenedesmus) is located in the well-supported tree of Hsp20 next to various bacterial taxa (e.g., Marinobacter spp., Marinimicrobia, Nitrospirae). The final case present the phylogeny of typical cold-shock protein CspA that promotes the correct folding of RNA molecules (Rennella et\u00a0al., 2017). We found that several CspA-like proteins from eudicots (e.g., Ricinus communis, Lupinus albus) are in close homology to CspA proteins from Betaproteobacteria lineages (e.g., Burkholderiaceae, Methylophilaceae) (\nFigure\u00a03C\n). Together, these phylogenetic relations might be existing molecular evidence supporting the HGT origins of plant abiotic resistance genes.", "Figure\u00a03Phylogenetic tree of heat and cold stress as well as oxidative stress resistance proteins in plant genomes originated from microbial taxa.

As illustrated in our results (\nTable\u00a02\n), it seems a potential strategy for plants to cope with the omnipresent oxidative stresses by obtaining directly from nearby microorganisms relevant resistance genes belonging to the canonical antioxidant machinery (e.g., hame peroxidase, glutaredoxin, thioredoxin, peroxin, peroxiredoxin, glutathione-S-transferase, cysteine synthase and glutamate/glutamine synthase) (Gill and Tuteja, 2010; Hasanuzzaman et\u00a0al., 2019). Furthermore, miscellaneous HGT genes encoding components of oxidative electron transfer chain such as cytochrome oxidase (an oxygen-reducing reducing proton-pump) were also discovered (\nTable\u00a02\n), which are suggested to be involved in oxidative stress and acid stress tolerance (de la Garza-Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition, also discovered in tested plant genomes were bacteria/fungi-originated genes encoding an isocitrate dehydrogenase (in Arabidopsis thaliana), which might supply reductant NADPH to defend against oxidative stress (Komatsu et\u00a0al., 2014), a phytoene dehydrogenase (in Chlorella variabilis) that converts phytoene into antioxidant carotene, a homocysteine S-methyltransferase (in Volvox carteri) that generates antioxidant methionine, as well as genes related to biosynthesis of antioxidant vitamins thiamine and cobalamin in multiple plants (Rosado-Souza et\u00a0al., 2020; V\u00e1squez et\u00a0al., 2022), as well as selenophosphate synthase and selenocysteine lyase putatively conferring oxidative stress protection (Costa et\u00a0al., 2011) (\nTable\u00a02\n).", "As verified through phylogenetic analysis, the tested HGT genes in plants are all faithfully clustering with distant microbial taxa (the HGT donors), showing strong HGT signs (\nFigure\u00a03\n). To be specific, in the well-supported phylogenetic tree of peroxiredoxin, homologues from the green algae (e.g., Chlorella, Auxenochlorella, Micractinium) and charophytic algae Klebsormidium are embedded in those from fungi (e.g., Phakopsora, Puccinia, Irpex), which indicated that the green algae might have gained peroxiredoxin genes through gene exchange from nearby fungi (\nFigure\u00a03D\n); Similarly, as seen from the reconstructed phylogeny of heme peroxidase (PoxA), a group of green algae (e.g., Gonium, Volvox, Scenedesmus, Ostreobium) is placed in the vicinity of multiple bacterial lineages (e.g., Thiothrix, Rhodospirillaceae, Anaerolineales) (\nFigure\u00a03E\n); Lastly, in the phylogeny of glutathione S-transferase (GST), homologues from the green algae (e.g., Chlorella, Rhizophagus, Coccomyxa) are enveloped by those from multiple bacterial lineages (e.g., Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Burkholderiales), again, suggesting the cross-kingdom HGT of GST genes among such taxa (\nFigure\u00a03F\n).", "HGT genes contributed to pH homeostasis", "Environmental pH is considered as an important factor for plants since it influences soil physical, chemical properties and nutrient availability and thereby affects plant inner homeostasis and growth (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2022). Interestingly, we have excavated seven microbe-derived gene entries linking with pH homeostasis maintenance and acid stress resistance in five tested plant genomes (\nTable\u00a02\n): two basic amino acid/spermidine/putrescine transporter and a proton extrusion protein (PcxA) encoding genes acquired from Bacteria, and genes within the arginine deiminase pathway (argininosuccinate synthase, argininosuccinate lyase, carbamate kinase and arginine deiminase) derived from Bacteria and Amoeba, which might conduct pH regulation by neutralization of proton with base substrates like ammonia, arginine and polyamine. Besides, the mentioned osmotic stress resistance ion/proton transporter above might also take part in adaptive responses to pH perturbation.", "We further selected and constructed the phylogeny of two representative HGT genes, which encode arginine deiminase (ArcA) in Volvox carteri (chlorophyte algae) and basic amino acid/polyamine antiporter (YhdG) in Physcomitrella patens (mosses), to test the reliability of the HGT inference (\nFigure\u00a04\n). Consistency, the well-supported phylogenetic tree constructed with not-exclusive top hit entries showed that ArcA homologues of Volvox spp. are clustering with those of several green algae affiliations like Scenedesmus spp., Chlamydomonas spp., and Chlorella spp. etc. (\nFigure\u00a04A\n, marked with green color), which are wholly embedded in homologous sequences from protist (e.g., Carpediemonas, Fonticula, Plasmodiophora and Naegleria etc.), the most likely cross-phylum HGT donor(s), and also, remotely associated with a cluster of Bacteria (e.g., Desulfobacterales). Likewise, the well-supported phylogenetic tree of YhdG showed that homologues of Physcomitrella, closely clustering with homologues of other mosses (e.g., Sphagnum spp., Ceratodon purpureus), liverworts (Marchantia spp.), and a green plant (Klebsormidium nitens), are nested within homologues of fungi (e.g., Mucor spp. and Aspergillus spp.) and bacteria (e.g., Acidobacteria, Aminicenantes and Solimonas), strongly indicating that cross-phylum HGTs might contribute to the spread of YhdG from microbes to plants (\nFigure\u00a04B\n).", "Figure\u00a04Phylogenetic tree of acid resistance and DNA damage resistance proteins in plant genomes originated from microbial taxa.

The accumulation of such damages in the plant would ultimately cause genomic instability and cell death (Tuteja et\u00a0al., 2009). Apart from cellular DNA-damage response pathways encoded by plants themselves, our results suggested that many plants have also recruited plenty of genes with functions related to DNA repair/replication/recombination (68 gene entries, see \nTable S1A\n at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20530083.v1). For example, we have also found in the reconstructed phylogeny of UvrD, a DNA helicase involved in excision repair of UV-induced\u00a0DNA\u00a0damage, that green algae homologues (e.g., Micractinium, Chlorella, Raphidocelis) are placed in the vicinity of homologues from cross-phylum Streptomyces spp. (fungi), which indicated the occurrence of HGT event (\nFigure\u00a04C\n); Likewise, we found that several green algae (e.g., Volvox, Chlorella, Chlamydomonas) contain Rad25, a DNA helicase required for DNA repair and RNA polymerase II transcription, which is in close sequence homology to that from fungi (e.g., Podila, Lactarius, Auriculariopsis) (\nFigure\u00a04D\n).", "HGT genes contribute to organic pollutant resistance", "Organic soil pollution discharged by anthropogenic processes like herbicides overuse and chemical waste mismanagement can threaten the life of plants, and the association of endophytic or mycorrhizal microbes with host plants can reduce the harmful effect of organic pollutants to plant (Sun et\u00a0al., 2015; Rajtor and Piotrowska-Seget, 2016). Interestingly, we found that plants have integrated various enzymes related to organic pollutant catabolism and several multidrug transport proteins into their genomes, such as cytochrome P450s, laccase, beta-lactamase, alkanesulfonate monooxygenase, haloperoxidase, most likely through HGT from nearby microbes (81 gene entries, see \nTable S1B\n at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20530083.v1). The most commonly-seen HGT enzyme of these, cytochrome P450 (CytP450, six gene entries), is a group of oxygenase enzymes that can catalyze the catabolism of a wide range of organic pollutants using oxygen as the electron acceptor, undergoing various detoxification reaction, including hydroxylation, N-, O-, S-dealkylation, sulfurization, epoxidation, deamination, desulfurization, dehalogenation, peroxidation, and N- oxide reduction (Lin et\u00a0al., 2022). In addition to microbial CytP450, two laccases for removal of phenolic pollutants (Asadgol et\u00a0al., 2014) were found in the genomes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively, putatively acquired from fungi. While other organic degradation oxidases we found acquired by plants from microorganisms might target more specific organic compounds, such as alkanesulfonate, amine and beta-lactams (see \nTable S1B\n at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20530083.v1).", "As before, the HGT possibility was tested on representative genes.

With the aid of the excellent deep-learning-driven structure prediction programs, AlphaFold2 (Jumper et\u00a0al., 2021) and RoseTTAFold (Baek et\u00a0al., 2021), we have generated full-length structure predictions of proteins encoded by all detected microbe-originated HGT genes in plants related to abiotic stress resistance in this study. The outcoming models of both methods in this test are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20530026.v1. The TM-align-based comparison showed that the predicted models from both methods (AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold) agreed well with each other, giving an average pairwise TM-score of 0.80 (TM-score > 0.5 indicates similar fold), indicating that our protein structural models are very reliable. We further used such protein models as inputs of the deep-learning-driven structure-based protein functional annotation program DeepFRI (Gligorijevi\u0107 et\u00a0al., 2021) for functional assessment. Results showed that about 68.5% molecular function annotations of these HGT-driven proteins have reliable confident scores above the DeepFRI significance cutoff score of 0.5 (see \nTable S1C\n at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20530083.v1), strongly indicating that most of the aforementioned HGT-originated abiotic stress resistance proteins can fold themselves into a correct, recognizable, and functional 3D topology.

Comparisons of the CytP450 protein structure from the plant representative with that from the predicted microbial donor representative (Synechocystis sp. PCC) reveal a pair of folds showing highly identical topology with pairwise TM-score of 0.75 and average root mean square deviations (RMSD) of 1.99 Angstrom (\u00c5). Resemblance was further found as we compared ligand-protein interaction patterns of these two structures by conducting classical molecular dynamics for 5 ns (\nFigures\u00a05C, D\n). Results showed that both proteins used conserved residues like positively charged Arg and aromatic Tyr, Phe for ligand interactions throughout the simulation, suggesting strong evolutionary connection and reaction feasibility.

The codon adaption index (CAI) initially proposed by Sharp and Li (1987) can measure synonymous codon usage bias for a tested gene sequence by comparing the similarity between the synonymous codon usage of a gene and the synonymous codon frequency of validated highly expressed reference gene sets. CAI value ranges from 0 and 1, with higher value indicating higher synonymous codon usage similarity with the reference/higher expression level (Puigb\u00f2 et\u00a0al., 2008). The CAI method has been successfully used in various areas, such as the predictions on expression likelihood (Puigb\u00f2 et\u00a0al., 2007; Puigb\u00f2 et\u00a0al., 2008) and level (Li et\u00a0al., 2019) of heterologous/HGT gene, and deduction of lifestyles based on genomic data (Willenbrock et\u00a0al., 2006). In this study, the expression levels of all predicted HGT genes conferring abiotic stress resistance in the plant genomes were assessed utilizing the codon adaption index (CAI) as a numerical estimator. Results showed that many HGT-driven abiotic stress resistance genes in plant genomes possess relatively high CAI values (\nFigure\u00a06\n): averagely, metal resistance (0.683), osmotic and drought stress resistance (0.682), acid resistance (0.712), heat and cold stress resistance (0.697), UV light damage resistance (0.702), and organic pollutant resistance (0.681). The HGT genes related with pH homeostasis and DNA repair have relative higher CAI values, which might indicate that the pH turbulence and UV light radiation are the most commonly encountered abiotic stresses.", "Figure\u00a06Ranges of codon adaption index (CAI) values of different kinds of abiotic resistance genes with EF-Tu gene as a reference.", "Ranges of codon adaption index (CAI) values of different kinds of abiotic resistance genes with EF-Tu gene as a reference.", "Together, it means that the strategy of acquisitions of abiotic stress resistance genes by plants from microbes to enhance adaption might be successful and significant as far as our results corroborate."]
