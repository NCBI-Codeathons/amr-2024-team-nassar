["Results and discussion", "The total number of bacterial genome sequences is steadily increasing over the last 15 years. However, the number of complete genomes is still relatively scarce. For the Family Streptomycetaceae, as of 30 June 2023, only 501 complete genomes were deposited in the NCBI database (Figure 1A). Here, we present and analyze a dataset which more than doubles this number of publicly available, high-quality\u00a0and complete genomes from important genera of filamentous Actinomycetia (Figure 1A and\u00a0B). We then use the dataset to show how high quality assemblies can be used for analysis which were not previously possible with fewer or more fragmented genomes.", "Sampling and basic statistics on raw data and assemblies", "We isolated almost 2000 strains of filamentous Actinomycetia from soil, and sequenced >1000 of them, with \u223c90% of them assembling into complete chromosomes. The 1034 Actinomycetia strains presented here were primarily sampled in Denmark, with 575 strains from Denmark having GPS coordinates, and 155 strains not having recorded GPS coordinates (Figure 2A, map and inner green dots, respectively). The soil samples were taken from all parts of the country of Denmark including islands such as Anholt, Bornholm and Sams\u00f8. In addition, there are 304 strains in the dataset which stem from soil samples collected outside of Denmark (Figure 2A, outer green dots), primarily from Germany, USA, and the Netherlands (Supplementary Figure S2).", "Figure 2.(A) Map of Denmark showing the sampling locations of the strains presented in this study.

Using an optimized, transposase based nanopore library kit protocol (18), we achieved a median nanopore read N50 of 15376 bp (s.d.= 5720, n\u00a0=\u00a0881) for strains which assembled completely to chromosome level, and a median read N50 of 13055 bp (s.d. = 6721 bp, n\u00a0=\u00a0153) for strains which did not fully assemble (\u2018WGS\u2019 level in NCBI terminology). The median total amount of nanopore data per strain was 427\u00a0595\u00a0032 bp for chromosome level assemblies (s.d.= 393\u00a0977\u00a0543 bp, n\u00a0=\u00a0881), and 549\u00a0676\u00a0990 bp (s.d.\u00a0=\u00a0469 155\u00a0351 bp, n\u00a0=\u00a0153) for near-complete assemblies (Figure 2B, each dot represents one strain). The N50 of chromosome level assemblies is longer than that of near complete assemblies (median of 15 kb\u00a0vs 12 kb). The six genomes which did not yield complete assemblies when the N50 was longer than 25 kb\u00a0were due to manual filtration as the coverage plots for those strains could not be explained or the issues resolved. The median total nanopore data amount per sample is actually higher in near-complete than in chromosome level assemblies, which reflects extra sequencing effort for strains which did not fully assemble after the initial data generation. In cases where the full dataset assembled into an ambiguous chromosome, we subsampled to remove the shortest and poorest quality reads and reassembled (see Supplementary Table S1 for the subsampling metrics), which in some cases resolved the chromosome. For a comprehensive examination of genome assembly pitfalls, see (18,40).", "Each genome was polished with illumina data. The median number of read pairs for the 1034 illumina datasets are 5\u00a0802\u00a0158 read pairs (SD: 2 191\u00a0734, q1: 4 580\u00a0544, q3: 6 971\u00a0980 read pairs), which is the rough equivalent of coverage 175 for a 10 Mb\u00a0genome. However, for a single genome, the illumina coverage was below 30\u00d7 (coverage 8, NBC_00443, illumina read pairs: 246\u00a0947). From the Polypolish report we calculated the median number of bases not covered by the illumina reads to be 167 bp or 0.0019% of the chromosome length (SD: 9709 bp, q1: 59 bp, q3: 462 bp, uncovered bases on the longest contig in each assembly). However, in a few cases, the number of uncovered bases was larger, up to 208\u00a0161 bp (2.2918%) for the chromosome of strain NBC_01738, which could affect the polishing quality (Supplementary Table S1). A large number of uncovered bases can be caused by poor library quality, which again can be caused by fragmentation, insufficient amount of input DNA, or excessive PCR amplification. Since a median of only a few 100 bp are not covered by illumina data, we consider the quality of the generated illumina data optimal for polishing, however certain types of errors will remain when using short reads for polishing (25). In line with previous findings on GC bias in illumina data (17), more uncovered bases are seen for genomes with higher GC % (Supplementary Table S1).", "The genome size for the 1034 strains range between 2\u00a0470\u00a0643 bp (Micrococcus luteus NBC_00112) and 14 072\u00a0637 bp (Embleyasp. NBC_0888) with a median genome length of 9 088\u00a0824 bp (quantile 1: 8 295\u00a0182 bp, quantile 3: 10 182 039 bp, standard deviation 1 479\u00a0678 bp). The GC content in the genomes ranges between 65% (Nocardia vinacea NBC_01743) and 74% (Actinomycetosporasp. NBC_00405), with a median GC content of 71%. The number of protein coding genes vary from 2194 genes to 12\u00a0441 genes with a median 7816 genes (n\u00a0=\u00a01034, standard deviation 1263 genes). The number of rRNA operons vary from 2 (e.g. Kribbella soli NBC_00256) to 12 (e.g. Kitasatospora purpeofusca NBC_01629), though most genomes have around 6 rRNA operons. See Supplementary Table S1 for a comprehensive overview of the basic statistics of the 1034 genomes including number of tRNAs, rRNAs, the GC-content, genome lengths, BUSCO scores, etc.", "A key metric for genome quality is identification of essential, conserved genes, often referred to as core genes. We explored this using the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) system with the most specific dataset containing all 1034 genomes: the actinobacteria_class_odb10 dataset of 356 gene models. As seen in Figure 2C, almost all genomes have more than 99% complete BUSCO genes from the Actinobacteria_class dataset, with a minimum of 95.8% complete BUSCO gene models (NBC_01737). Though a median of 99.7% complete BUSCO gene models (SD 0.33%, q1 99.5%, q3 99.7%) can be considered close to perfect, closer inspection of the \u2018fragmented\u2019 and \u2018missing\u2019 BUSCO genes reveal that out of the 1466 total missing and fragmented BUSCOs in 1034 genomes, 886 of them (60%) have the same BUSCO gene marked as \u2018fragmented\u2019 (334658at1760, \u2018cold-shock protein\u2019). This potential artifact particularly affected the genus Streptomyces, where 858 out of 886 genomes (97%) were found to have the gene \u2018fragmented\u2019. This could be due to an adaptation in the Streptomyces genus, or a technicality in the actinobacteria_odb10 BUSCO dataset. We do not use the BUSCO category \u2018duplicated\u2019 as a quality metric, as the validity could be obscured by BGCs carrying resistant versions of the core gene product they are targeting (41), or simply by non-lethal gene duplications. We did, however, use the duplication score to exclude genomes from the dataset if >100 duplicated genes were identified. For three genomes, (NBC_00217, NBC_00887 and NBC_00899), the duplication score was high (16.9%, 26.7% and 27.2%, respectively), and is in all three cases caused by unusually long TIRs duplicating a part of the core genome, possibly as a result of recent and potentially unstable genomic rearrangements.", "Comparative genomics reveals a high taxonomic diversity of the G1034 dataset", "In order to estimate the diversity of the G1034 dataset, we performed taxonomic analysis at the whole genome level. GTDB-based taxonomic assignment showed that 1034 genomes were distributed across 27 genera including Streptomyces (n\u00a0=\u00a0885), Micromonospora (n\u00a0=\u00a036), Kitasatospora (n\u00a0=\u00a027)\u00a0and Nocardia (n\u00a0=\u00a021). This study significantly increased the number of complete genomes for several of these genera. One of the strains failed GTDB-Tk run (NBC_01635) and another (NBC_01309) was not assigned to any of the GTDB genera. This strain NBC_01309 with the assigned family Streptomycetaceae represents a potentially novel and unique genus based on genome sequence data. The taxonomic novelty was determined using the RED-score of 0.84. These two strains are not included in the analysis in this section.", "We further note that 570 of the 1032 genomes could be assigned to one of the 145 GTDB-defined species. The remaining 462 genomes were not assigned to any of the taxonomically or computationally defined species. Thus, they likely represent new species that have\u00a0not been described before and thus expand the existing phylogenetic diversity of the Streptomyces and other genera. We carried out MASH-based analysis (35) to detect diversity among these 462 genomes. A whole genome similarity network was reconstructed with 95% similarity as a cutoff for edges. Using a community detection algorithm, we identified 244 communities in the network that can be computationally assigned as different species with 95% similarity cutoff. Some of these MASH-based species had multiple genomes (e.g. 28, 16, 13, 10, etc.). As many as 171 of the 244 MASH-based species were represented by only a single genome, whereas 58 of the 145 GTDB-assigned species were represented by a single genome. Overall these statistics highlight the diversity of the sequenced collection. See Supplementary Table S1 for NCBI, GTDB-Tk and MASH taxonomic assignment for each strain.", "Next, we inferred phylogenetic trees of the G1034 dataset and the dataset of the genus Streptomyces with publicly available genome (Figure 1C, D) using GTDB-Tk (42). The different species in the G1034 dataset are widely distributed and include representatives of most sub-phyla. The phylogenetic tree of all complete Streptomyces genomes further illustrated the diversity of the dataset in the context of existing public data. We observed that there are certain clades of the tree that are overrepresented and very few that do not contain strains from our collection. It is likely that there is still high potential to isolate novel species from this genus and thereby expand the phylogenetic diversity of public databases.", "As expected, the G1034 dataset is a rich source of specialized biosynthetic gene clusters. In an analysis of antiSMASH7 annotations, 29\u00a0024 regions encoding BGCs were identified in the genomes. As also observed in other studies (43), there are clear correlations between genome size and the number of BGCs in the various genera in the dataset (Figure 3A). Many Actinomycetia BGCs are hybrids between several biosynthetic types (e.g., type I PKS and NRPS). To generate BGC abundance statistics, we used the antiSMASH proto-clusters (44), as the protocluster annotation level takes into account the composition of the hybrid BGCs. BGCs coding for the biosynthesis of terpenoids (5866), NRPS (5291) and type I PKSs (4099) are most abundant in the strains, but also siderophores (2396), RiPPs (1986), type III PKS (1848), butyrolactones (1766) and type II PKS (1545) containing BGCs are widespread.", "Figure 3.(A) Distribution of number of BGC regions against genome length.

Hybrid cluster types are represented in all individual protoclusters in these statistics.", "Streptomyces chromosomal organization", "While most bacterial genomes are circular, most Streptomyces genomes are linear and carry a linear inverted repeat on the ends of the chromosome arms (45), overlapping with, but not identical to the chromosome arms. Of the 1034 genomes in this publication, 886 belong to the genus Streptomyces, of which 742 are chromosome level assemblies. We used the assembly repeat graph from Flye (21) to manually determine the topology of each individual genome. In Figure 2D, six chromosome layouts are shown, exemplified by flye assembly repeat graphs. Both circular and linear topologies are found among the genomes presented here. The linear genomes often but not always were found to have large unresolved Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs), of up to 2.8 Mb\u00a0in length. The assembly repeat graphs has been suggested to be a useful guide in correctly assembling a chromosome where the repeats vastly outsize the read length, as is the case for most of the linear inverted repeats of Streptomyces (https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye/issues/610#issuecomment-1629027346).", "Streptomyces show strong variability in the length of the terminal inverted repeats", "Out of a total of 742 chromosome level Streptomyces genomes, TIRs could be identified in 79% (587/742), while in 21% (155/742), no TIR was identified using our BLAST based methodology. The strains without identified TIRs could either not contain them, or perhaps the assembly or identification process somehow fell short for these strains, for example the nanopore or illumina polishing could have truncated the extreme chromosome ends. Plotting the TIR lengths both as absolute values and as a fraction of the total chromosome length (including both TIRs in a genome) reveal that the size of the TIRs range from less than 100 bp to almost 3 Mb, and from <0.01% to >50% of the total chromosome size (Figure 2E and\u00a0F, see Supplemental Table 1 for the data used for the figures). Most of the TIRs are in the 10\u00a0000\u2013150\u00a0000 bp range or 0.3\u201310% of the total genome size (median 50\u00a0618 bp, q1: 14 006 bp, q3: 147 244 bp, SD: 274\u00a0156 bp). The huge size range of >1000-fold showcases the highly dynamic nature of the TIR. We then analyzed the distribution within the named species with more than 10 members (Figure 2E and\u00a0F, colored dots), and found that even within species, the length of the TIR is highly dynamic ranging for example from few 100 bp to more than 100\u00a0000 bp in the most abundant species in the dataset Streptomyces anulatus (Figure 2E and\u00a0F, red dots). This dynamic TIR correlates to observations of Streptomyces strains undergoing large changes in the TIR during growth in a laboratory, and to frequent reports of the loss of one or both chromosome arms due to double strand breaks (11,45). Understanding these processes also has very important implications for engineering Streptomyces, i.e. in knockout experiments, where a duplicate gene can be harder to modify or in the worst case even can cause megabase-sized deletions. Since BGCs are commonly examined and often found on TIRs, there is a high risk of misinterpreting experimental results if the TIR is not correctly accounted for.", "Streptomyces show conserved core gene placement", "In order to explore the genome organization of the 742 linear Streptomyces genomes, we first oriented all genomes according to the direction of the dnaA gene. For circular genomes, this gene is commonly used to rotate and orient the genome sequence (46). For four strains, there were two annotated dnaA genes, however in all cases the dnaA genes were located on the same strand. Around 50% of genome sequences were reverse complemented, as would be expected from a random initial genomic direction. We used the 124 HMM gene models in the bacteria_odb10 (v.2020-03-06) BUSCO dataset to identify single copy essential genes conserved in all Bacteria, as these can be considered the most conserved core genes. The position of each gene was then extracted from the genbank files and used for the probability density estimates in Figure 4A and\u00a0B, with the middle of gene coordinates being used for calculations. This revealed that the placement of the core genes in linear Streptomyces genomes is extremely structured: the dnaA gene is the most centrally placed conserved gene in the complete Streptomyces genomes, encoding the DNA replication initiation protein. It is located exclusively near the mathematical center of the linear chromosome with a median distance of \u221221\u00a0173 bp, just upstream of the chromosome center (q1: \u2212130\u00a0158 bp, q3: 77\u00a0679 bp, SD: 214\u00a0661 bp). An additional 11 genes are consistently located around the chromosome center, among them genes encoding ribosomal proteins and tRNA ligases (Figure 4A, red and orange hues).", "Figure 4.Kernel density plots of core genes and BGC protoclusters along the 742 complete linear Streptomyces genomes in the present study.

(B) Secondary copy core genes showing a distal placement for all but one core gene. (C) The six antiSMASH categories of protoclusters, showing a distal placement for all except for the \u2018other\u2019 category.", "Generally, all 124 bacterial core gene models seem to have a preferred distance to the chromosome center (see Supplementary Figure S3 for complete legend for Figure 4A. See Supplementary Table S2 for the tables used for Figure 4). From the small ribosomal subunit, 10 out of 17 genes are in the chromosome arms 12\u201325% of the arm length distance from the chromosome center (Figure 4A, green and yellow hues) in a clear focal point likely reflecting a cluster of ribosomal operons. In the same focal point, 14 out of 25 genes from the large ribosomal subunit are found. Other ribosomal proteins such as L20, L35\u00a0and S4 are positioned halfway towards the chromosome ends (Figure 4A, purples). Generally, only a few genes shared by all of Bacteria are placed outside of the inner 75% of the chromosome, which can be considered the central genomic region. For genes unaffected by the direction of replication, the density on either side of the chromosome center should be of equal size. However, there seem to exist a preferred position of a group of genes relating to the direction of the dnaA gene, where several of the ribosomal genes are more likely to be found downstream than upstream of dnaA. This effect can be observed for most core genes, but it seems that the effect decreases with the distance to the chromosome center. This observation of core gene placement is in agreement with previous observations on a smaller Streptomyces dataset (15,47) and several genome organization descriptions (48,49), where core genes were found close to the central chromosome in a \u2018central compartment\u2019.", "In most genomes, a few BUSCO genes are found in duplicate. A total of 2179 genes were found in duplicate from 742 complete Streptomyces genomes, giving an average duplicate count from the bacterial BUSCO dataset of approximately three genes per genome (Figure 4B). Most of the duplicated genes are positioned away from the chromosome center with a single prominent exception of the ribosomal protein S18 gene (1940575at2), which have densities both in the central chromosome and on the chromosome arms. For the remaining secondary duplicate genes, the density estimates are shifted towards the ends of the chromosome arms, away from the chromosome center. This observation is in line with the observation that BGCs often carry a resistant version of the target of the specialized metabolite\u00a0(41). The observation that duplicate core genes are placed towards the chromosome ends is affected by the methodology: the primary and duplicate gene copies are distinguished by the distance to the chromosome center, where the most central copy is assumed to be the primary copy. This forces the \u2018secondary\u2019 copy to be more distal than the \u2018primary\u2019 copy. The number of duplicated genes is only a small subset of the total number of genes visualized (Figure 4; 92\u00a0006 versus 2179 genes).", "BGC are not placed randomly on linear Streptomyces genomes", "Having documented the conserved placement of core genes along the linear Streptomyces chromosome, we next investigated the placement of BGCs. The observation that biosynthetic gene clusters often are located towards the linear chromosome ends has been suggested since the first complete Streptomyces genome sequences became available\u00a0(14). antiSMASH (v.7.0.0) operates with 81 rules, each describing the core biosynthetic requirements of a specific type of BGC, e.g. Type 1 Polyketide Synthase (T1PKS) or lassopeptide. Each cluster type has a predefined neighborhood on either side of the core cluster (e.g. 20 kb\u00a0on either side of T1PKS core genes), which together constitutes a protocluster. Overlapping protoclusters are annotated as a \u2018region\u2019, the primary output from the antiSMASH software. Each protocluster is annotated as one of six categories, responsible for production of the most common groups of compounds: non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS), polyketide synthase (PKS), terpenes, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPP), Oligosaccharide, and \u2018other\u2019. Depending on the purpose of the analysis, we either analyze protocluster or region in this paper. For a comprehensive overview of the annotation layers generated by antiSMASH, please refer to (6,44). For an overview of the protocluster types, categories, and counts, please refer to Supplementary Table S3.", "The global distribution of BGCs on linear Streptomyces chromosomes was explored using the six antiSMASH categories (Figure 4C). In all cases except for \u2018other\u2019, the BGC category is preferentially located towards the end of the chromosome, confirming previous observations that most specialized metabolite clusters are placed distally on the linear Streptomyces chromosome. The \u2018other\u2019 category includes a diverse range of BGCs, which could explain the lack of a clear pattern in the distribution. For the category oligosaccharide, the density is skewed to the right arm, however this could be an artifact from a low number of protocluster observations and an uneven taxonomic distribution (n\u00a0=\u00a0103). In total, this analysis is based on 29\u00a0933 Streptomyces protoclusters. We chose to represent the annotation level \u2018protocluster\u2019 to get a comprehensive overview of BGCs not impacted by adjacent BGCs which antiSMASH did not resolve. However, since some clusters are true hybrids consisting of more than one type of protocluster, this approach risks overestimating the total number of clusters in a dataset. Conversely, had we used the antiSMASH annotation level \u2018region\u2019, the number of common cluster types would certainly be underestimated, as clusters physically near\u2014but unrelated to\u2014other clusters would be in the same region and thus only be represented once, severely reducing the dataset near the linear chromosome ends.", "We then proceeded to analyze the placement of a few common antiSMASH cluster types, (T1PKS, T2PKS, T3PKS, trans-AT PKS), or cluster types which had a clear distribution along the linear Streptomyces chromosomes (NI-siderophore, NRP-metallophore, Ectoine, Melanin, Arylpolyene). Plots for the remaining cluster types (with enough observations for a density plot) can be found in Supplementary Figure S4. Some BGCs encoding the biosynthetic machinery for small compounds (e.g. furan and phosphonate) are located centrally on the linear chromosomes indicating that they may be conserved as part of the core genome. This raises the question of whether they are classical secondary metabolites, or have fundamental roles. Possibly some of these secondary metabolites are as important for survival as primary metabolites, or act multifunctionally. Phosphonates, for example, have innate bioactivities as antibiotics and have been suggested to be part of the signalling machinery (50,51). This suggests that there is no clear cut between primary and secondary metabolism, but more of a spectrum of importance.", "Polyketides", "For each of the four PKS types in Figure 5, there is a mostly symmetrical distal distribution, with very few protoclusters found in the central region of the genome. Trans-AT PKSs seem to be heavily skewed to the \u2018right\u2019 chromosome arm, however the number of observations is low (139) which means that the distribution could be skewed by a few common cluster families.", "Figure 5.Kernel density plots showing the placement of specific antiSMASH7 protocluster types along the linear Streptomyces chromosomes.

In bacteria, biosynthesis of these metallophores can be distinguished to be either dependent or independent of an NRPS (for an overview, see (52)). In Streptomyces genomes both the NRPS dependent type (called NRP-metallophore, Figure 5, middle right) and the NRPS independent type (called NI-siderophore, Figure 5, center) can be found. Notably, NI-siderophores tend to be placed more centrally on the chromosomes whereas NRP-metallophore clusters occur more distally.", "Ectoines", "Ectoine (Figure 5, lower left) is a compound which plays roles in protecting cells against osmotic stress. The BGCs responsible for production of Ectoine have a mostly symmetric distribution approximately halfway between the linear chromosome center and the chromosome ends, in an area where core genes are often found. This very localized placement suggests a conservation in the distribution along the linear Streptomyces chromosome.", "Melanines", "Melanin-type protoclusters (Figure 5, lower middle) are placed all the way along the linear chromosome, with peaks both in the distal parts and the more central parts. Melanin-type clusters are responsible for production of dark or colorful pigment compounds, with several subtypes performing different roles. The best known role for a melanin compound is UV protection in both eu- and prokaryotes, but some melanin-type clusters encode compounds with antibacterial and antiviral activity (53), hinting that the distribution of melanins along the linear chromosome could be more located if the BGC type was broken further down into cluster families.", "Arylpolyenes", "Arylpolyenes (Figure 5, lower right), which are pigments with functions similar to carotenoides, is encoded by a special subtype of T2PKS type BGCs (54). Arylpolyene BGCs have a prominently central location on the linear chromosome, potentially reflecting a role in primary metabolism.", "For the BGC types CDPS, NAPAA, NRPS, NRPS-like, hlgE-KS, terpene, lanthipeptide-class-iv, linaridine, redox-cofactor, RiPP-like, amglyccycl (Aminoglycoside/aminocyclitol), aminopolycarboxylic acid, betalactone, blactam, indole, nucleoside, and \u2018other\u2019, a distal distribution is also seen, whereas for the remaining types, the distribution is either central or spread out over the whole genome (See Supplemental Figure 4 for distribution plots of all cluster types with >50 observations).", "A treasure trove for specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters using trans-AT PKS BGCs as an example", "While statistics on the BGC-content give an excellent overview of the biosynthetic potential of the individual strains, they don\u2019t indicate the diversity of BGCs across the dataset. To analyze the biosynthetic potential of a dataset, BGCs can be assigned to gene cluster families (GCFs). GFCs contain similar BGCs that most likely are involved in the biosynthesis of identical or chemically closely related natural products. A common approach for GCF identification includes reconstruction of a similarity metric between BGCs and then grouping BGCs into GCFs based on clustering of the similarity networks. For example, BiG-SCAPE generates BGC-class specific combined distance metric based on similarity metrics(36). Inclusion of BGCs for known natural products from the MIBiG reference database allows the assessment if the identified GCFs contain BGCs involved in the biosynthesis of known molecules or if they code for potentially novel pathways (55). A similarity network analysis with BiG-SCAPE indicated that the 29\u00a0024 BGC regions of G1034 can be assigned to as many as 7193 GCFs. 190 of these could be associated with a BGC in the MIBiG reference dataset and thus likely code for known compounds or derivatives of these. We note that 4400 of the BIG-SCAPE GCFs are unique to individual isolates in the dataset. As the diversity of BGCs and GCFs in the G1034 dataset is enormous, we chose to focus on the BGC type trans-AT PKS as an example of how to query the dataset.", "Trans-acyltransferase polyketides constitute a highly diverse group of bacterial multimodular specialized metabolites. These compounds are biosynthesized through diverse biosynthetic pathways, posing significant challenges for their characterization using computational prediction tools. Unlike cis-acyltransferase polyketide synthases (cis-AT PKSs), where acyltransferase domains are integrated within the modules, trans-AT PKSs are characterized by the fact that the acyltransferase is encoded as a separate gene. The polyketide product often diverges from this expected module-based structure, however, common traits of trans-AT PKSs have aided the prediction of these intricate pathways (56). One example is the catalytic ketosynthase (KS) domains in the trans-AT PKS pathway, which can be grouped into clades correlating with distinct substrate specificity (56,57). For a detailed description of the trans-AT PKS biosynthesis see (58). These conserved features make detection of trans-AT PKSs possible, however, subsequent manual curation of the BGCs is beneficial when comparing novel BGCs as they may be assigned to a MIBiG reference because they share genes adjacent to the biosynthetic core but not necessarily synthesize similar molecules.", "In our analysis of the G1034 dataset, we identified 247 trans-AT hits matching the antiSMASH trans-AT classification rule. Of these, 122 BGCs showed high similarity to 14 BGCs of known compounds. This similarity was confirmed through manual inspection of each BGC by identifying the described core genes in the biosynthesis pathway, as detailed in the methods section. Remarkably, out of the 17 described trans-AT PKS reference BGCs found in the MIBiG database from the phylum Actinomycetia, 14 are found in the G1034 dataset. The 247 transAT-PKS BGCs stem from 87 different species which are represented with fewer than ten trans-AT PKS BGCs, and two species, Streptomyces sp003846175 with 26 trans-AT PKS BGCs and Streptomyces anulatus with 56 transAT-PKS BGCs. These two species are also among the most well represented in the G1034 dataset with 26 and 25 strains, respectively.", "Furthermore, our analysis revealed 41 trans-AT PKS BGCs that did not resemble a MIBiG reference with similar biosynthetic genes. These BGCs were categorized into 7 gene cluster families and 14 singletons with unique domain organization. Given their distinct profiles, these GCFs are presumed to be putative novel BGCs, potentially representing new natural products (see Figure 6B). The remaining 84 BGCs were not included in this analysis as they were found to be part of larger hybrid cluster regions, which if included would interfere with GCF assignment.", "Figure 6.GCF network and BGC region comparison of selected identified GCFs.

This cutoff highlighted substantial similarities among the BGCs, despite divergent features primarily due to neighboring genes to the biosynthetic core causing the BGCs to deviate from the main network cluster with BGCs that share biosynthetic core properties. A notable example of this scenario is the 5 kirromycin-like BGCs, which, despite a gene rearrangement and distinct flanking regions between its BGCs, share similar biosynthetic core regions, but are split into two network clusters (Figure 6B, yellow). Accession numbers can be found in Supplementary Figure S5 and the manually curated overview of trans-AT PKS BGCs can be found in Supplementary Table S4."]
