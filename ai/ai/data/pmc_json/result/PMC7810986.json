["Results", "Multitiered scaffolding strategy to derive a high-quality plant genome assembly", "Assembling a high-quality reference plant genome is challenging due to the inherent heterozygosity, polyploidy, and high repeat content of plant genomes. With the reduced cost of long-read sequencing and advances in scaffolding technologies; however, it has become feasible to achieve plant genome assemblies at the pseudomolecule level19. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, such as Bionano optical maps and Hi-C library sequencing provide valuable orthogonal evidence to validate and improve reference genomes, and to derive chromosome-level genome assemblies20,21. Despite this progress, nearly all plant genomes remain highly fragmented, with hundreds to thousands of remaining\u00a0assembly gaps (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). In this study, we used a stepwise integration and assembly validation approach using four complementary NGS technologies to derive O. pumila de novo genome assembly: PacBio single-molecule reads (~122\u00d7), Illumina paired-end reads (~96\u00d7), Bionano optical mapping (~250\u00d7), and Hi-C library sequencing (~90\u00d7; Fig.\u00a01a and Supplementary Data\u00a01). A contig-level genome assembly, optimized for different parameters and raw-read lengths using PacBio reads in the Canu assembler22, spanned the entire genome in 243 contigs (Supplementary Data\u00a02). Validation of the contig-level assembly using Bionano optical maps identified 15 assembly conflicts (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03), which were manually examined and subsequently corrected. The contig-level genome\u00a0assembly was subjected to scaffolding using either Bionano or Hi-C libraries, or sequential scaffolding using all possible combinations, i.e., scaffolding first through Bionano and subsequently through Hi-C, or vice versa. We observed an advantage of sequential scaffolding over a single scaffolding approach, with scaffolding first through Bionano and then by\u00a0Hi-C as the best combination (Table\u00a01). The final Ophiorrhiza genome assembly of 439.90\u2009Mb was achieved within 31 contigs, with contig and scaffold N50 values as 18.49 and 40.06\u2009Mb, respectively (Fig.\u00a01a, Table\u00a01, and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Full-length chromosome arms were assembled for half of the Ophiorrhiza chromosomes, with only\u00a021 remaining\u00a0assembly gaps in the entire genome assembly, including the 11 difficult-to-assemble and highly repetitive centromeres (Fig.\u00a01b). We also adopted our sequential scaffolding strategy to achieve phased diploid assembly of Ophiorrhiza using preliminary contig-level assembly derived from Falcon-unzip23, resulting in 11 chromosomes with scaffold N50 for haplotig1 and haplotig2 as 40.36 and 42.83\u2009Mb, respectively (Supplementary Figs.\u00a04 and 5, and Supplementary Data\u00a03 and 4).Fig. 1Multistage assembly validation to achieve chromosome-level genome assembly for a high repeat content plant genome.a The hierarchical genome assembly and assembly validation pipeline, and the improvement of assembly contiguity in terms of contig N50, scaffold N50, and assembly gaps of O. pumila genome.

Assembly validation, starting from PacBio, followed by Bionano, and finally Hi-C provided a stepwise improvement in assembly contiguity. With few remaining genome gaps and contig-level completeness, the Ophiorrhiza reference and phased genomes are, to the best of our knowledge, the most contiguous and complete de novo reference plant genomes to date (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02 and Supplementary Data\u00a05).", "Experimental validation for gaps is the missing piece of the next-generation genome assembly pipeline", "While scaffolding approaches align and order contigs, orientation of contigs within an assigned scaffold are prone to errors due to the lack of sequencing data evidence\u00a0at the\u00a0assembly gaps. This shortcoming of modern-day genome assemblies is widely acknowledged, yet it has been neglected and is regarded as a technical limitation of the genome assembly pipeline. To achieve an experimentally validated and accurate plant genome assembly, we next performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for each scaffold of the Ophiorrhiza genome at the assembly gaps (Supplementary Data\u00a06). All chromosomes, except chromosome 2, showed FISH signals at the ends of contiguous scaffold arms separated by assembly gaps, in accordance with our genome assembly (Fig.\u00a01b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). For chromosome 2, an orientation misalignment was detected at the gap between two contigs, as the sites that were expected to be adjacent to the assembly gaps were detected at the end of each of the chromosomal arms (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). We used FISH evidence to correct contig orientation within assigned scaffolds for chromosome 2. The chromosome sizes estimated using FISH analysis were consistent with the corresponding assembled chromosome sizes for the O. pumila genome (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07 and Supplementary Table\u00a01). The accuracy of the finalized reference and phased genome assemblies was also supported by Bionano optical map data, Bionano de novo assembly, and Hi-C chromosomal contact matrix (Fig.\u00a02, and Supplementary Figs.\u00a08 and 9).Fig. 2Hi-C contact map of high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of O. pumila.a\nO. pumila plant under controlled growth conditions. b\u2013l A Hi-C contact matrix visualization for individual chromosomes of O. pumila reference genome assembly.

Synteny analysis of the Ophiorrhiza genome showed synteny depths of 3:1 and 2:2 with the AEK and V. vinifera genomes, respectively (Supplementary Figs.\u00a010 and 11). The results showed a conserved and colinear relationship for the Ophiorrhiza genome with AEK and V. vinifera with minimal rearrangements, with 1 chromosome fission and 11 chromosome fusions, resulting in the present-day karyotype of the Ophiorrhiza genome. Comparison with AEK further supported the accuracy of the karyotypic order of the Ophiorrhiza genome and identified the whole-genome triplication (\u03b3) shared among eudicots, with no sign of further genome duplications (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010a\u2013c).", "We next compared the Ophiorrhiza genome with the genome of Coffea canephora29, also from the Rubiaceae family, which has previously been used as a representative asterid genome for paleogenomic interpretations28. Synteny analysis between the Ophiorrhiza and C. canephora genomes showed a potential karyotype rearrangement, with chromosomes 2 and 9 of Ophiorrhiza showing syntenic relationships with chromosome 2 of the coffee genome (Fig.\u00a03a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a010e). The chromosome 2 segment of the coffee genome with a syntenic relationship with chromosome 9 of the Ophiorrhiza genome showed associations with chromosome 13 and chromosome 16 of V. vinifera (Fig.\u00a03a). Given that the genome of Ophiorrhiza is near-complete with only 21 assembly gaps, whereas the coffee genome is only 80% complete and has 7250 assembly gaps, the observed syntenic and potential karyotype rearrangement could very well be a possible misassembly of the coffee genome (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012). Furthermore, the chromosome sizes estimated through FISH analysis supported the Ophiorrhiza genome assembly (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07 and Supplementary Table\u00a01). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis of coffee genome misassembly through FISH analysis in Coffea arabica, an allotetraploid genome resulting from hybridization between C. canephora and Coffea eugenioides. FISH analysis using probes designed for the two segments on chromosome 2 of the coffee genome that were in apparent synteny with two chromosomes of the Ophiorrhiza genome produced signals on two different chromosomes instead of on the same chromosome. The FISH analysis suggested a possible misassembly in the coffee genome (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). Plant genome paleohistorical scenarios and gene-cluster-based specialized metabolite analysis assume accurate gene order for the inputted plant genomes. However, this is most likely not the case for most plant genomes, as very few genomes have been verified. Ophiorrhiza genome assembly provides a valuable resource to validate and improve other plant genomes, and will serve as a model to understand the evolution of genome structure in asterids.Fig. 3O. pumila genomic landscape and convergent evolution of monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis.a Synteny blocks between O. pumila, C. canephora, and V. vinifera.

We used repeat analysis to locate the pericentromeric regions, which were confirmed using FISH analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a016). The near-complete genome assembly of Ophiorrhiza also allowed us to identify telomere regions for all eleven chromosomes (Supplementary Data\u00a011). Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog (BUSCO)30 analysis using the Ophiorrhiza reference and phased genome assemblies showed 97.1% and 91.2\u201391.4% completeness, respectively (Fig.\u00a03c).", "Repeat analysis showed 58.17% Ophiorrhiza genome comprised of transposable elements (TEs), the majority being long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, ~75% of which were classified as Gypsy-LTRs (Supplementary Data\u00a012). A comparison of TEs across other plant species showed Gypsy-LTR as the dominant repeat class in O. pumila, R. stricta, C. roseus, C. canephora, Nicotiana benthamiana31, and Solanum lycopersicum32, while the C. acuminata genome was dominated by Copia-LTR repeats (Fig.\u00a03d, Supplementary Fig.\u00a017, and Supplementary Data\u00a012). OrthoFinder33 analysis-based gene family classification for 33 plant genomes representing broader plant lineages, followed by phylogenetic analysis for single-copy genes using PAML MCMCTREE34 software estimated divergence times for Ophiorrhiza from coffee, C. roseus, and C. acuminata at ~47, ~68, and ~120\u2009Mya, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018). Synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) for the paralogs of O. pumila, C. roseus, C. acuminata, Arabidopsis thaliana, and coffee genome showed a distinct peak at Ks\u2009=\u20092, which represents well-reported and conserved whole-genome triplication across core eudicots35 (Fig.\u00a03e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a019).

The exceptions are MIA quinolone derivatives, e.g., camptothecin, which is synthesized by Rubiaceae members, such as Ophiorrhiza, as well as by C. acuminata in the Cornales. WGDs and TE are regarded as key mechanisms for evolving novel features in plants36\u201339. The differential repeat profiles across the O. pumila, C. roseus, R. stricta, and C. acuminata genomes and WGD in C. acuminata suggest different trajectories of acting evolutionary forces, yet resulting in similar chemotypes across MIA-producing plants from the Gentianales and Cornales orders. These results raise the possibility of either a convergent evolution of MIA biosynthesis in otherwise distant plant species or an ancient origin of MIA biosynthesis, which is subsequently lost repeatedly across plant species, while retained by the producing plants.", "Diverse indole alkaloids consistent with enzyme families evolved in the Ophiorrhiza genome", "Stable isotope labeling, coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry, offers a powerful approach to assign atom numbers and chemical information to the detected metabolites. It increases the confidence in molecular formula determination for identified metabolite features by eliminating false positives, while considering elemental compositions7,40,41. To expand the known chemodiversity of O. pumila, particularly nitrogen-containing specialized metabolites, we used a complete 15N-based stable isotope labeling and metabolome analysis approach as previously reported for complete 13C-based metabolome labeling for O. pumila and 11 other plant species\u00a0(Supplementary Fig.\u00a021)7,40. Complete 15N labeling of the Ophiorrhiza metabolome and previously acquired 13C-labeled metabolome annotation datasets allowed us to chemically assign 273 nitrogen-containing metabolites, mostly annotated as indole alkaloids (IAs), MIAs, and carboline moieties containing metabolites (Fig.\u00a04, Supplementary Fig.\u00a021, and Supplementary Data\u00a013 and 14). The Ophiorrhiza metabolome showed distinct and diverse nitrogen-containing metabolites, including MIAs, when compared with previously analyzed plant metabolomes (Fig.\u00a04)40. The MIA biosynthetic pathways are well conserved across producing plant species and are derived from strictosidine (or strictosidinic acid, in the case of C. acuminata)42. Along with derivatives of strictosidine, camptothecin, and known intermediates of the camptothecin biosynthetic pathway (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01), MIAs such as eburnamonine, nothapodytine, vincamenine, and D-glucopyranosyl vincosamide have also been identified in Ophiorrhiza. Specialized metabolite classes, including MIAs, IAs, and anthraquinones, accumulated in a tissue-specific manner, with the highest levels in the root and hairy root, and low levels in the leaf tissues (Supplementary Figs.\u00a022 and 23, and Supplementary Data\u00a015). Several of the assigned MIAs were also reported previously in C. roseus, G. sempervirens, and C. acuminata7. Consistent with MIA accumulation, gene expression analysis showed tissue-specific expression of secoiridoid biosynthesis-related genes, with high expression in the root and hairy root, and low expression in the leaf and cell suspension culture of O. pumila (Supplementary Figs.\u00a01, 24 and 26, and Supplementary Data\u00a016\u201318). Expression analysis showed that homologs of genes associated with secoiridoid and MIA biosynthesis were highly coexpressed, and were considered strong candidate MIA biosynthesis genes in O. pumila. Secoiridoid biosynthesis genes were highly coexpressed with homologs of MIA biosynthesis-associated\u00a0enzymes, including 10-hydroxycamptothecin O-methyltransferase, O-acetylstemmadenine oxidase (ASO/PAS), polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase (PNAE), perakine reductase (PR), rankinidine/humantenine-11-hydroxylase 3 (RH11H), sarpagan bridge enzyme (SBE), strictosidine beta-D-glucosidase (SGD), tabersonine-19-hydroxy-O-acetyltransferase (T19AT), tabersonine 3-oxygenase, and tetrahydroalstonine synthase (THAS; Supplementary Figs.\u00a025\u201327). Integration of metabolome and transcriptome profiling for multiple tissues of Ophiorrhiza identified strong candidate MIA biosynthesis genes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a027 and Supplementary Data\u00a019). The expression of genes associated with secoiridoids and MIA biosynthesis showed a strong correlation with MIA accumulation, indicating that the Ophiorrhiza\u00a0root and hairy roots are the sites of active biosynthesis (Supplementary Figs.\u00a023, 26 and 27, and Supplementary Data\u00a019).Fig. 4Ophiorrhiza pumila metabolome, assigned using 13C and 15N stable isotope labeling, compared with metabo-space of 11 plant species.Circuit A shows plant species used to compare metabolome space with that of O. pumila, and circuit B shows the connections between metabolite features, and are based on metabolite network relationships defined by a correlation coefficient >0.85. Highly accumulated metabolites across 12 plant species and their relationships in the form of metabo-ontology and scaled accumulation levels as a heat map are shown here.

Using OrthoFinder-based gene classification, we identified a total of 15,943 orthogroups shared among the four MIA-producing plants, with 64.8% of orthogroups being common to all four species and 513 orthogroups being specific to the MIA-producing plants (Supplementary Fig.\u00a028 and Supplementary Data\u00a020). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the MIA-specific orthogroups showed dioxygenase (OG:0016701) and oxidoreductase activities (OG:0051213), biochemical reactions essential for MIA biosynthesis and diversification, as the significantly enriched GO terms (Supplementary Fig.\u00a028c). The orthogroups were further analyzed to infer the ancestral and lineage-specific gene content along the phylogenetic tree, and to calculate posterior probabilities for gene family evolution and dynamics. Compared to Ophiorrhiza and other MIA-producing plants, the C. acuminata genome showed massive gene expansion, which is consistent with the WGD identified in this study. Overall, the Ophiorrhiza genome showed gain and expansion for 1047 and 1225 orthogroups, respectively (Fig.\u00a05 and Supplementary Data\u00a021), and GO enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment of processes associated with dioxygenase activity, hydrolase activities, hydroxyl-methyl glutaryl-CoA, and oxidoreductase activities. Several genes assigned to secoiridoid and MIA biosynthesis and highly correlated with metabolite accumulation patterns in Ophiorrhiza were among the gene families expanded or gained specifically to MIA-producing plants (Supplementary Data\u00a019\u201321). Unless there exists a completely independent pathway toward the biosynthesis of MIAs across producing plants, an unlikely scenario, the shared chemotype suggests the possible existence of conserved gene families and secondary metabolite gene clusters within these plant genomes, with positive gene selection or gene expansion occurring during the evolution of MIA biosynthesis2,7,42.Fig. 5Evolution as gain (red), expansion (purple), loss (blue), or contraction (gray) of the orthogene families in context of phylogenetic profile.Count software was used to calculate posterior probabilities to capture the dynamics of evolution through the reconstruction of ancestral gene content and changes at the key nodes, which correspond to the lineage-specific gene characteristics.

Source data are provided as a Source data file.", "The generation of strictosidine is the committed step in the biosynthesis of MIAs in Gentianales. Orthogene-based classification of genes showed that STR coding enzymes were divided into two distinct groups. Orthogene family OG0000148 was represented in all plants except Papaver somniferum and Amborella trichopoda, while OG0015245, which included all known and functionally characterized genes for strictosidine synthesis, was specifically gained and expanded in Gentianales, including those from O. pumila, C. roseus, and G. sempervirens (Fig.\u00a06a and Supplementary Data\u00a021). Compared to C. roseus and G. sempervirens, which included single-copy genes in the orthogene family OG0015245, the O. pumila genome included two genes resulting from tandem duplication, namely, Opuchr05_g0008300 and Opuchr05_g0008180. Gene family analysis of functional STR homologs of O. pumila across the genomes of 32 plant species showed no representatives from ancient plant genomes, monocots, and AEK (Supplementary Fig.\u00a029). The biosynthesis of MIAs in C. acuminata was previously attributed to strictosidinic acid and not strictosidine, which supports the absence of genes in orthogroup OG001524542,43.", "An alternate pathway for MIA biosynthesis in C. acuminata is through strictosidinic acid, which is synthesized by the condensation of secologanic acid with tryptamine42. Recently, Yang et al. functionally characterized Cac_g012666.t1 (CYP72A610) and Cac_g017137.t1 (CYP72A565) as bifunctional SLS-like enzymes, catalyzing the synthesis of loganic acid from 7-deoxyloganic acid and subsequently to secologanic acid43. The tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) enzyme, which synthesizes tryptamine from tryptophan, is represented by the orthogene OG0000823. Unlike orthogenes representing functional STR and SLS, OG0000823 was present in all plant species that we analyzed, suggesting an essential role of TDC in amino acid metabolism in plants. Phylogenetic analysis for orthogenes representing SLS and STR showed genes being assigned to two distinct groups, those present specifically in MIA-producing plants and those that are also present in the non-MIA-producing plants (Fig.\u00a06b\u2013d). Similar to functionally characterized STR and SLS enzymes, orthogenes corresponding to enzymes associated with MIA biosynthesis, such as SGD, THAS, SBE, T19AT, PNAE, ASO/PAS, and PR, were also specifically expanded in Ophiorrhiza and at least one of the other three MIA-producing plant genomes (Fig.\u00a06a and Supplementary Data\u00a021). Phylogenetic analysis of these specialized enzymes also showed MIA plant-specific gene family formation, which included previously functionally characterized enzymes involved in MIA biosynthesis (Supplementary Figs.\u00a030\u201340). Phylogenetic analysis and gene gain/expansion analysis showed a positive selection of gene sets specific to MIA-producing plants. Moreover, the emergence of specialized enzymes, including STR and bifunctional SLS, specific to MIA-producing plants and catalyzing the synthesis of strictosidine showed the importance of strictosidine biogenesis in facilitating the evolution of novel enzymes for MIA biosynthesis and diversification.", "WGDs and small-scale duplications (SSDs) are the major source of evolutionary novelty, providing gene pools to evolve new or specialized functions, and also play an important role in speciation44\u201346. Theoretical models for the evolutionary trajectories of duplicated genes propose that, in most cases, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while another copy neutrally evolves without any selective constraints, thus resulting in its inactivation due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations or even deletion47. In a small fraction of cases, the duplicate gene\u00a0undergoes gain-of-function mutations and is retained through positive selection forces46. The native genes undergo a rapid rate of mutation and thus should have a lower Ks value than the ancestral genes, resulting in the emergence of a new enzyme with a novel function. However, in contrast to this hypothesis, the median Ks for enzymes associated with secoiridoids and MIA biosynthesis in both MIA-producing and nonproducing plants was 1.586, which corresponds to the Ks median for OG0015245 (STR; Fig.\u00a06e). MIA-producing plants showed a lower Ks median than non-MIA-producing plants for OG000040 (G10H), OG0012198 (10-HGO), OG0013118 (7-DLGT), OG0014621 (LAMT), OG0013616 (SLS), OG0015245 (STR), OG0011713 (THAS), OG0010376 (PNAE), OG0003863 (ASO), and OG0007482 (PRX1), suggesting a higher rate of substitution and evolution for these specialized enzymes. The median Ks for TDC, an enzyme essential for tryptophan metabolism across all plant species, showed a similar substitution rate in MIA- and non-MIA-producing plants (Fig.\u00a06e and Supplementary Data\u00a022). For camptothecin-producing plants, the median Ks for genes associated with MIA biosynthesis was significantly smaller in O. pumila and C. acuminata but higher in the coffee genome, which shares otherwise high genome collinearity and sequence similarity with the Ophiorrhiza genome (Supplementary Fig.\u00a041). A higher median Ks for the MIA-associated orthogene families in the coffee genome suggests an ancient origin for the genes that otherwise would have been actively evolving, as suggested by the smaller median Ks value. Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood test and BUSTED analysis48 for orthogene families gained or expanded in MIA-producing plant genomes indicated positive selection for SLS (OG0013616) and STR (OG0015245) specific to the MIA-producing plant species (Fig.\u00a06b, d).", "Evolution of MIA biosynthesis is\u00a0centered around secondary metabolite gene clusters", "To gain insight into whether the physical location plays a role in positive selection and expansion of genes associated with MIA biosynthesis, we performed gene cluster analysis in the Ophiorrhiza genome. In total, we identified 358 metabolic gene clusters in the O. pumila genome, representing 3551 gene models across 11 chromosomes (Supplementary Data\u00a023). Coexpression analysis for a given gene cluster showed a low Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) value, with the median PCC value for 3/4th of the gene clusters being <0.3 (Supplementary Data\u00a024). We identified metabolic gene clusters, such as C1394, C1620, C1708, C1709, C1909, C1925, and C1959, which included 7\u201318 gene members, and were highly coexpressed. Using the presence of at least one orthogene family associated with MIA biosynthesis pathways from O. pumila gene models in the identified gene clusters as the selection criteria, we assigned 33 gene clusters as putative MIA gene clusters (Supplementary Data\u00a018, 23 and 24). While MIA biosynthesis-associated genes were highly coexpressed, MIA gene clusters showed low coexpression values among member genes. Among the MIA gene clusters, C1385 and C1749 showed coexpression between member genes. Although our results showed low coexpression coefficients for genes\u00a0within a gene cluster, we observed 261 gene clusters with at least one pair of genes having PCC values over 0.7. The fact that several of these gene clusters included genes with no expression within the\u00a0tissues analyzed\u00a0was one of the reasons for the low PCC scores within individual gene clusters. The behavior of the identified gene clusters and associated coexpression values were similar to previously reported trends in other plant genomes49,50, suggesting a lack of widespread coexpression among member genes of associated gene clusters in plants.", "Out of 358 secondary metabolite gene clusters identified, 91 gene clusters included at least one orthogroup specific to MIA-producing plants (Supplementary Data\u00a020 and 23\u201326). One of the key gene clusters identified in the Ophiorrhiza genome was C1541, which included functionally characterized TDC (Opuchr05_g0008370-1.1) and STR (Opuchr05_g0008300-1.1 and Opuchr05_g0008180-1.1) together with enzymes annotated as amino acid transporters, cytochrome P450 71A3, NAC domain-containing protein, and multi-antimicrobial extrusion (MATE) protein (Fig.\u00a06f). Previously, C. roseus and G. sempervirens genome analysis have also reported the presence of a STR-TDC-MATE gene cluster6. Synteny analysis showed conserved synteny between the C. roseus and G. sempervirens genomes at C1541, which included both functionally characterized STR, TDC, and MATE proteins. The coffee genome, which shares significant collinearity and sequence similarity with the Ophiorrhiza genome, also showed conserved gene cluster collinearity with C1541 (Fig.\u00a06f, and Supplementary Figs.\u00a012 and 15). However, the relatively conserved functional STR orthogenes present across strictosidine-derived MIA-producing plants at gene cluster C1541 were lost in the coffee genome, while other features of the gene cluster, including TDC coding enzymes, were retained (Fig.\u00a06f). Comparative genome analysis between Ophiorrhiza and coffee showed high sequence similarity and gene localization along chromosomes, yet loss of functional STR within the coffee genome at the gene cluster may have limited the opportunity to direct evolution toward MIA biosynthesis, which also explains the higher median Ks for enzymes associated with MIA biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a041). The entire secoiridoid biosynthetic pathway and MIA biosynthesis-associated genes from the Ophiorrhiza genome were present in 29 out of 33 MIA gene clusters (Supplementary Fig.\u00a026). The association of coexpressed genes assigned to secoiridoid and MIA biosynthesis pathways with gene clusters was statistically significant based on two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test with corrected p value\u2009<\u20090.05. Furthermore, at least one-third of the member genes of 20 out of the 33 MIA gene clusters showed conserved collinearity in the C. roseus, C. acuminata, and G. sempervirens genomes (Fig.\u00a07, Supplementary Figs.\u00a042\u201348, and Supplementary Data\u00a026). The gene cluster C1693 exhibited conserved synteny for functionally characterized genes encoding 10-HGO, ASO/PAS, and THAS3 in C. roseus, while an adjacent gene cluster, C1684, showed conserved synteny for the functionally characterized G10H in O. pumila and C. roseus (Supplementary Fig.\u00a046). Synteny between O. pumila and C. roseus or G. sempervirens genomes centered around gene clusters was statistically significant based on Fisher\u2019s exact test (p value <0.05), suggesting gene clusters as the critical genomic regions for the evolution and expansion of specialized metabolites (Supplementary Data\u00a026). The median Ks for gene clusters in the O. pumila genome in synteny with other MIA-producing plant genomes suggests conserved gene content and gene order (Supplementary Data\u00a025 and 26). Tandem duplications within O. pumila MIA gene clusters were also statistically significant, with genes encoding STR, SLS, 7-DLH, 7-DLGT, and other MIA-associated genes being duplicated and gained within identified gene clusters. These gene clusters represent the pangenome for MIA biosynthesis and include several functionally characterized genes, as well as potential genes involved in MIA biosynthesis, which also showed a high correlation with nitrogen-containing metabolites identified in the Ophiorrhiza metabolome (Fig.\u00a07 and Supplementary Figs.\u00a042\u201348).Fig. 7Monoterpene indole alkaloid gene clusters identified in chromosome 2 in the Ophiorrhiza genome.In total, we identified 33 MIA gene clusters in Ophiorrhiza genome distributed across eight of its chromosomes (Supplementary Figs.\u00a042\u201348).
