["Results", "Requirements for cleavage complex stabilization by albicidin", "All available crystal structures of DNA gyrase determined to date use the so-called gyrase cleavage core fusions, that is, truncated and fused constructs consisting of the C-terminal topoisomerase-primase (TOPRIM) domain of GyrB and the N-terminal part of GyrA (Fig. 1a). ATPase domains of GyrB and DNA-wrapping C-terminal domains (CTD) of GyrA, which are crucial for DNA supercoiling activity36, are absent in these protein constructs. Several attempts to co-crystallize core fusions with albicidin were not successful. Therefore, we switched to an alternative cryo-EM approach involving full-length E. coli gyrase and short DNA oligonucleotides reported by the Bax group37. However, we repeatedly failed to observe bound albicidin in the model.", "We hypothesized that albicidin binding might require a strand-passage event to reveal the hidden inhibitor binding pocket. As it is known that stabilization of the gyrase cleavage complex by microcin B17 requires a long DNA segment (>150\u2009bp) to be present38,39, we adopted a similar approach for albicidin. We thus tested a range of different DNA fragments, representing strong gyrase-binding sites (SGSs) of plasmid pBR322 or phage Mu, and found strong cleavage of the 217\u2009bp Mu SGS fragment (Mu217) in the presence of albicidin, ATP or its non-hydrolysable analogue ADPNP. Importantly, almost no cleavage was detected with fragments shorter than 150\u2009bp or in the absence of a nucleotide (Extended Data Fig. 1). A long DNA fragment able to engage the GyrA CTDs was thus essential to populate an albicidin-susceptible conformation of DNA gyrase. In summary, cleavage complex stabilization by albicidin critically depends on the presence of nucleotide and the length of the DNA substrate. We scaled-up the production of Mu217 (Methods) and used it to determine all the structures described below.", "Albicidin traps gyrase through asymmetric bicentric binding", "Cryo-EM micrographs of the gyrase\u2013DNA\u2013albicidin complex in the presence of ADPNP (Gyr\u2013Mu217\u2013albicidin) revealed high structural homogeneity and virtually no DNA static disorder. This allowed reconstruction of the enzyme cleavage core (residues 8\u2013524 of GyrA and 405\u2013804 of GyrB) at local resolution of 2.6\u2009\u00c5 (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and unambiguous assignment of the Mu217 DNA sequence, a dramatic improvement compared to the previously available data40. CTDs of GyrA with wrapped DNA and ATPase domains of GyrB were also observed but at much lower resolution (>5\u2009\u00c5) due to intrinsic flexibility (Fig. 1c) and were not modelled. The overall appearance of the holocomplex was similar to the only other available cryo-EM structure of E. coli gyrase in complex with gepotidacin (PDB: 6RKW and 6RKV)40. Apart from the DNA, the enzyme had almost perfect C2 symmetry, with ATPase domains centred roughly on the central axis of the complex above the GyrA/GyrA\u2032 protein\u2013protein interface (DNA-gate) with a small tilt towards one of the CTDs. The Mu217 DNA was cleaved, and the cleavage sites corresponded exactly to the positions known from biochemical41 or next-generation sequencing42 experiments (5\u2032-T/GATTT-3\u2032, and 5\u2032-A/AATCA-3\u2032 on the opposite strand; gyrase cleaves DNA leaving 4\u2009bp overhangs).", "A single bound albicidin molecule was clearly observed in the Coulomb potential density map (Fig. 1c,d). The N-terminal end of the L-shaped molecule (residues MCA1 and pABA2) intercalated between the cleaved DNA fragments right next to the phosphotyrosyl bond, between nucleobases T14 and G15 of the 5\u2032-T/GATTT-3\u2032 non-palindromic cleavage site (Fig. 2a,b). The same \u2018+1\u2019 pocket is occupied by FQs and related compounds, although the binding mode is completely different (see Extended Data Fig. 4 for the comparison of symmetric FQ- and asymmetric gepotidacin- and albicidin-binding sites)43. The terminal hydroxyl of MCA reached C18 and A19 on the opposite DNA strand, located within 5\u2009\u00c5 of GyrB Lys447. The requirement for intercalation of an oblong fragment explains the decreased activity of the kinked and thus shorter (Z)-MCA1 isomer of albicidin44,45. At the same time, the C-terminal segment of albicidin (pMBA5 and pMBA6) filled the space between two opposing helices \u03b13 and \u03b13\u2032 (residues 66\u201376), forming the GyrA/GyrA\u2032 dimer interface (DNA gate) (Fig. 2c). This required a substantial opening of the enzyme, evident by the sliding-door-like motion of the GyrA/GyrA\u2032 monomers: the GyrA tower domain is shifted 10\u2009\u00c5 outwards compared to the gepotidacin cryo-EM structure, while the aforementioned helix \u03b13 slides by 5\u2009\u00c5 and moves 3\u2009\u00c5 away from its opposing monomer. Similar shifts were observed for GyrB including the TOPRIM domain and insert (Supplementary Fig. 1). Formation of the phosphotyrosine pTyr122 led to an 8\u2009\u00c5 displacement of DNA ends (Supplementary Fig. 1). Our structure thus represents the previously unseen catalytic intermediate that can be placed between the partially open precleavage gepotidacin structure (PDB: 6RKV) and the fully open state (topo II\u03b1 structure, PDB: 5ZEN46 or open Streptococcus pneumoniae GyrA dimer47, PDB: 6N1P) (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movie 1). Interestingly, the position of GyrA CTDs also differed from earlier observations40. In our map, CTDs are moved considerably upwards in a symmetric fashion, nevertheless, the projected DNA path points away from the enzyme cavity (see Supplementary Fig. 2 for the rigid body fit). The observed position of CTDs might indicate the stage of the catalytic cycle at which the enzyme is trapped (Discussion).Fig. 2Albicidin-binding pocket.a, Enlarged view of the albicidin-binding site in the Gyr\u2013Mu217\u2013albicidin structure.

This asymmetric binding caused pronounced DNA distortion in the symmetry-related AA pocket (between 3\u2032A and 5\u2032A in strand 5\u2032-A/AATCA-3\u2032), which is smaller in size (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that while theoretically possible, we did not observe even low-occupancy density for albicidin in this smaller AA pocket. Therefore, the size of the intercalating group in conjunction with the properties of DNA must impose selectivity towards the TG pocket. We are not aware of previous examples of such strong selectivity shown by any topoisomerase poison.", "Albicidin binding nevertheless exploited the symmetry of the enzyme in an elegant way, with the virtually identical residues pMBA5 and pMBA6 bound in a pseudosymmetric manner. The methoxy groups of pMBA5 and pMBA6 occupied hydrophobic pockets formed by side chains of GyrA Ala67, Val70 and Met120 and their counterparts from the opposing GyrA\u2032 monomer (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3c). Interestingly, the same hydrophobic residues are also targeted by gepotidacin, but in an entirely different way (Extended Data Fig. 4). Residue Cya3 in albicidin, serving as a hinge point for the otherwise rather rigid molecule, was in close contact with catalytic Tyr122 of GyrA with a hydrogen bond forming between the N1 amide nitrogen and the scissile phosphate (3.3\u2009\u00c5). Another interaction was observed between the side-chain carboxylate of Glu744 (GyrB\u2032) and the nitrile (N2) nitrogen of Cya3 (Fig. 2c). Apart from these hydrogen bonds, the majority of interactions are hydrophobic as albicidin precisely filled the available space between \u03b13/\u03b13\u2032 helices or DNA bases. Therefore, binding of albicidin requires opening of the DNA gate and the precise positioning of the main gyrase catalytic residues, most probably occurring during a single round of DNA strand passage.Fig. 3Binding of albicidin derivatives.a, Chemical structure of parent albicidin, Albi-1, Albi-2 and Albi-3.

Ultraviolet irradiation of the Gyr-Mu217\u2013photo-Albi complex led to a shift in the position of the DNA band on a polyacrylamide gel (Extended Data Fig. 5). This shifted band did not appear upon irradiation of a non-photocrosslinkable analogue. Irradiation of a photo-Albi\u2013DNA mixture also did not lead to crosslinking, therefore indicating that the N-terminus of photo-Albi is positioned to interact with cleaved DNA only when gyrase is present and catalytic conditions are satisfied. Addition of a molar excess of the FQ ciprofloxacin (CFX) outcompeted photo-Albi and precluded the appearance of the shifted DNA band, in agreement with the partially overlapping binding loci of FQs and albicidin (the TG pocket) (Extended Data Fig. 4).", "There has been an ongoing debate regarding the exact mechanism of metal-ion-dependent DNA cleavage employed by type II topoisomerases; various crystal structures have been analysed and a range of occupancies at two metal-binding sites, termed A and B, have been reported43,48. Analysis of these structures has been complicated by the symmetry-related disorder present in many of them. In addition, different metals (Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+) have been used to obtain crystals which can considerably affect the interpretation. In our structure, a long substrate DNA is wrapped around GyrA CTDs, bound in a single orientation, and cleaved as the result of enzymatic activity, allowing us to observe a clear homogeneous state before DNA religation takes place. As the complex was prepared in 2.5\u2009mM Mg(OAc)2 (Methods) we assigned Mg2+ as the most probable identity for the observed single, well-defined density stretching from Asp500 of both GyrB protomers in the complex. The shape of the density was consistent with the expected octahedral coordination sphere (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 6). Partial opening of the DNA gate in our structure led to movement of GyrB subunits further apart, with the metal ion still being attached to Asp500. Thus, although the actual position of the metal was not directly equivalent to the one observed in the previously reported crystal structures, it nevertheless corresponded to the B configuration used to temporarily store the metal during strand passage43. As our structure most probably represents the conformation before the religation step (Discussion), the likely interpretation is that the metal ion remains attached to residue Asp500 throughout the catalytic cycle of DNA gyrase. This might help to anchor the nucleophilic 3\u2032OH group of the cleaved DNA to the GyrB TOPRIM domain and ultimately, to GyrA via the latter\u2019s N-terminal helix. Although the observation cannot be considered as a definite proof, our results are thus compatible with the single-ion mechanism, where the metal ion is stored in the so-called B configuration for a large part of the catalytic cycle while the DNA is cleaved, but moves towards the pTyr122 to catalyse religation. We cannot, however, exclude a temporary recruitment of a second metal ion immediately before the religation or cleavage takes place.", "Potentiated albicidin derivatives show binding heterogeneity", "Encouraged by our results, we moved to further characterize the structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) of para-aminobenzoic acid antibiotics. We started from a potentiated albicidin derivative Albi-1 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7) with features leading to improved pharmacological characteristics and nanomolar-range activity towards FQ-resistant pathogens26 (a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\u2009\u2264\u20090.016\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u22121 for E. coli; see also Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 8). This compound has the residues pABA2 and pABA4 substituted by pyridines, aza-histidine replacing Cya3, and an isopropoxy moiety in residue 5. The compound also has the N-terminal MCA1 replaced by p-cyanobenzoic acid, resulting in a shortened molecule. Initial analysis of collected cryo-EM data (Gyr\u2013Mu217\u2013Albi-1) converged with a consensus ensemble map consistent with a mixture of states in which Albi-1 occupied either the AA or the TG pocket with partial occupancy (AA and TG states). Moreover, an additional state of low occupancy was populated with the N-terminal segment of Albi-1 intercalated to the TG pocket, but with its C-terminal half oriented externally (XT state) and pointing towards the protein surface, instead of wedging the GyrA/GyrA\u2032 dimer interface (see Extended Data Fig. 9 for data processing and Extended Data Fig. 3 for compound density). As it was not sterically possible for these states to coexist in the same molecule, we used a masked three-dimensional (3D) classification to separate the data into three maps, representing the three binding modes (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 9). We refined models for AA and TG binding states separately, while the XT state density was not sufficient for unambiguous refinement. Hence, we only tentatively modelled the XT-bound state based on the rings\u2019 orientation observed in all other structures to obtain the likely conformation depicted in Fig. 3b. AA and TG maps also suffered from orientation bias and low number of particles; however, the density was sufficiently clear to allow unambiguous compound modelling. In both reported (AA and TG) Albi-1 models, the incorporated aza-histidine group was directed towards the catalytic Mg2+ ion at a 2.7\u2009\u00c5 distance between the presumed metal-coordinated water and the N2 atom of the triazole. We believe the coordination provided by the triazole might additionally stabilize the bound state. Further stabilization is provided by the larger isopropoxy group in residue 5 that can better occupy hydrophobic pockets at the dimer interface (Fig. 3c) and the pyridine N9 atom of residue 2 orienting towards the phosphate of pTyr122 at a 3.4\u2009\u00c5 distance (Fig. 3c). As the residue 6 of Albi-1 does not have methoxy or isopropoxy substituents, it appears that a single isopropoxy group on residue 5 is sufficient to anchor the compound in the hydrophobic pocket.Table 1MIC (\u00b5g\u2009ml\u22121) of albicidin derivatives used in this study against selected Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms (see Extended Data Fig. 7 for structures of all compounds)E. coli BW25113E. coli DSM116B. subtilis DSM10M. luteus DSM1790M. phlei DSM750S. typhimurium TA100Albicidina0.0630.0630.0630.063<0.250.251.01.02.02.00.063Azahis\u2013Albia<0.016<0.016<0.016<0.0160.0310.0630.0310.0310.1250.5<0.016<0.016Albi-1a<0.016<0.0160.0310.0310.0310.063<0.016<0.0160.250.5<0.016<0.016Albi-2b4.04.02.04.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.00.50.5Albi-3a<0.016<0.016<0.016<0.0160.0630.1250.0630.0630.51.0<0.016<0.016Alkyne\u2013Albia<0.016<0.016<0.016<0.0160.0630.125<0.016<0.0160.250.5<0.016<0.016AE-1c>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0AE-2c>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0AE-3c>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0AE-4c>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0AE-5c>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0>8.0One or two independent biological replicates are reported, with each done in technical triplicates.

Superscript letters indicate three activity groups: amost potent; bintermediate; cleast active.", "The observation that a shorter N-terminal p-cyanobenzoic acid of Albi-1 allowed it to occupy both the TG and AA pockets, along with the tolerance for hydroxy/methoxy groups in residue 6, prompted us to synthesize C-terminally truncated derivatives with the idea that two copies of shortened molecules could bind symmetrically and simultaneously to the gyrase homodimer. We removed pMBA6 and used only a substituted aniline as a C-terminal building block to avoid steric hindrance between the potentially opposing binders (Extended Data Fig. 7, AE-series). We observed severely decreased activity for these compounds in both MIC and gyrase assays (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 9). Therefore, both residues 5 and 6 are important to block the DNA gate and trap DNA gyrase. In contrast, the N-terminal arm of albicidin, which does not make any specific protein contacts apart from Lys447 of GyrB, could clearly endure substantial refactoring with the main requirement of being flat and providing \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions with DNA bases. Indeed, we found the alkyne derivative alkyne\u2013Albi, which is resistant to (E)\u2013(Z) photoisomerization44, to be as active as albicidin in a DNA cleavage assay (Table 1, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 9).", "Taking account of these data, we synthesized two further compounds Albi-2 and Albi-3 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7) where we replaced residue MCA1 of albicidin by decorated quinoline or naphthalene moieties with known ability to intercalate in DNA as flat aromatic molecules49,50. With Albi-2 we additionally explored electrostatic interactions with GyrA Asp82 by replacing the methoxy group of pMBA5 with an aminoethyl. Albi-3 was found to be highly bactericidal (MIC for E. coli, <0.016\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u22121), whilst Albi-2 showed severely diminished activity compared with both Albi-3 and albicidin in MIC assays (4\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u22121, that is, 60-fold increase in MIC for E. coli compared with the parent compound; Table 1). However, Albi-2 had ~4-fold better activity in the gyrase inhibition assay than Albi-3, indicating that the aminoethyl moiety compromises cell entry (Table 1, Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 8). Therefore, to better understand the effects of different structural variations of albicidin, we selected Albi-2 rather than Albi-3 to determine its conformation in the gyrase\u2013DNA complex (Gyr\u2013Mu217\u2013Albi-2) at 3.25\u2009\u00c5 resolution (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 10). The binding of Albi-2 displayed a degree of heterogeneity, but in contrast to Albi-1, the vast majority of particles fell into a single class corresponding to the occupied TG site (that is, similar to parent albicidin). We did not try to resolve alternative binding modes in this case. It seemed that the size of the N-terminal segment indeed controlled the positioning of the compound, with the larger N-terminal residues of albicidin and Albi-2 preventing intercalation into the smaller AA pocket. The amino group introduced in residue 5 of Albi-2 was not found to interact with Asp82 of GyrA, but instead rotated away towards the hydroxy group of residue 5. Non-optimal contact with GyrA Met120 and exclusion from a largely hydrophobic pocket is the likely reason.Fig. 4Effects of GyrA and GyrB mutations on susceptibility to albicidins.a, CC50 values for albicidin, Albi-1, Albi-2 and Albi-3 determined for WT E. coli gyrase and selected mutants.

We also could not observe any mutants when Tsx was externally supplemented on a pBAD plasmid. We therefore designed several gyrase mutants based on the Gyr\u2013Mu217\u2013albicidin structure to specifically impact albicidin binding. We also aimed to determine the effect of clinically relevant FQ-resistance mutations on albicidin\u2019s ability to inhibit gyrase. Hence, we targeted the main albicidin binding pocket, that is, the \u03b13/\u03b13\u2032 interface between GyrA monomers, and other neighbouring GyrA and GyrB residues (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3). To avoid introducing substitutions not existing in nature, we used multiple sequence alignments of GyrA subunits provided by the ConSurf server52. We then produced the gyrase variants, tested their enzymatic activity in supercoiling and cleavage assays and determined CC50 (concentration required to achieve half of maximum DNA cleavage) values for albicidin and its derivatives Albi-1\u20133 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 3\u20138).", "Three GyrA mutations affected gyrase activity: GyrAA67Q showed a 4-fold decrease in activity in both supercoiling and cleavage assays (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 5), while mutations GyrAR68A and GyrAM120A affected the supercoil setpoint of the enzyme (induced relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA substrate in the presence of ATP) (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). This relaxation effect could be ascribed to the weakening of the GyrA/GyrA\u2032 interface, potentially affecting the directionality of strand passage. Interestingly, the variant GyrAD82N, previously reported to decrease DNA cleavage with FQs and related drugs53, had no visible effect on gyrase cleavage activity in our hands nor did it affect cleavage with Albi-1 (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4 and 7).", "The FQ-resistance mutation GyrAS83L led to a modest 3-fold increase in CC50 values for the parent compound and a small decrease in the maximum amount of cleavage observed, in line with previous observations20, but had virtually no effect on activity of improved derivatives Albi-1 and Albi-3 (Fig. 4a,e and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). This is a striking result, because the majority of clinically relevant resistant variants are the alterations of GyrA Ser83 or Asp875,54,55. Unlike FQs, binding of albicidins is not controlled by the metal-dependent anchoring to GyrA Asp87 and Ser83, meaning that albicidins are unaffected by the quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR) of GyrA. In contrast, when the main hydrophobic \u03b13/\u03b13\u2032 binding pocket was altered in variants GyrAA67Q (smaller and more polar) and GyrAV70A (larger), the CC50 for albicidin increased more than 10- and 25-fold, respectively. Testing the resistance of these mutants to Albi-1 and Albi-3 showed that GyrAV70A is fully susceptible to these derivatives, while GyrAA67Q is still resistant (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs. 4, 7 and 8). Loss of susceptibility to the Val to Ala substitution can be rationalized by stronger binding as a result of a bulkier isopropoxy group (Albi-1) or a quinoline core (Albi-3). At the same time, the steric hindrance introduced by the Ala to Gln replacement dramatically increased resistance to all albicidins (Fig. 4). GyrAI74M, GyrAD72N and GyrAM120A did not show increased resistance to either Albi-1 or albicidin (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 7) judged by the CC50, but GyrAI74M demonstrated ~2-fold reduction in the maximal amount of cleavage observed with the parent compound (Supplementary Table 4).", "In GyrB, we targeted three residues: Lys447, implicated in FQ resistance56, and located 4\u2009\u00c5 from the N-terminus of albicidin, Glu744 and Lys740 (Fig. 4b). Variants GyrBE744A and GyrBK740A were incapable of fully supercoiling DNA, with the GyrBK740A variant causing increased DNA cleavage, and therefore were not used in further assays (Supplementary Figs. 3, 5 and 6). For Lys447 we initially screened three naturally occurring substitutions (Arg, Glu and Trp) (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 and Supplementary Table 3) and selected GyrBK447W for further assays because of more pronounced effects. GyrBK447W showed a 10-fold increase in CC50 compared with the parent compound and a more than 50-fold increase relative to the Albi-1; it also decreased the maximal cleavage observed with the parent compound 3-fold (Supplementary Table 4). However, the same variant was much more susceptible to the quinoline analogue Albi-3 with a bulkier bicyclic residue 1 (CC50\u2009=\u200990\u2009nM, 69% maximal DNA cleavage) and to Albi-1 (Fig. 4a,c, Supplementary Figs. 5, 7 and 8 and Supplementary Table 4).", "As the aminoethyl derivative Albi-2 was slightly less active (CC50\u2009=\u2009135\u2009nM) against wild-type (WT) gyrase compared to parent albicidin (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 8), we only tested quinolone-resistant variants GyrAS83L and GyrBK447W, and variant GyrAV70A which has shown high resistance to parent albicidin. Surprisingly, none of the mutations substantially increased resistance to Albi-2 measured by the CC50 although the maximal amount of cleavage was lower than with other compounds (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 4). Additionally, in a bid to understand the lower activity of the compound, we tested the GyrAM120A variant which reduces the potential steric hindrance caused by the aminoethyl moiety (Fig. 3a). However, the CC50 of Albi-2 against GyrAM120A was not affected by the mutation (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 8). The probable reason for the lower activity is the exclusion of the amine from the hydrophobic pocket.", "We demonstrated that the activity of albicidin derivatives remains almost completely unaffected by the known mutations in the QRDR of GyrA that confer quinolone resistance. While the Lys447 mutation in GyrB QRDR offered some resistance, especially to the parent compound, its effect could be successfully overcome by the alterations of the DNA-intercalating moiety as demonstrated by Albi-3. While the designed GyrAA67Q mutation provided some resistance to Albi-1 or Albi-3, this variant is unlikely to naturally evolve as it disrupts gyrase function. Notably, we could not generate this or any other gyrase mutation in selection screens.", "Albicidins target E. coli Topo IV", "One of the reasons for the difficulties encountered in selecting resistant mutants for albicidin could be dual-targeting, that is, the ability to target Topo IV alongside gyrase in bacteria. To test this possibility, we carried out initial E. coli Topo IV activity and cleavage complex stabilization assays in the presence of albicidin, Albi-1, Albi-2 and Albi-3 (Supplementary Fig. 11). All compounds, with the exception of Albi-2, could stabilize the cleavage complex with Topo IV, the most potent being Albi-1. A linear DNA band could be observed at 1\u2009\u00b5M concentration of Albi-1 compared with 10\u2009\u00b5M required for the parent compound. In the inhibition assays, 10\u2009\u00b5M of Albi-1 and Albi-3 was required for full inhibition of Topo IV relaxation activity, compared with 100\u2009\u00b5M for Albi-2 or the WT albicidin. Therefore, the albicidin derivatives described in this study can clearly inhibit Topo IV, albeit with lower efficiency than DNA gyrase, and chemical modifications can additionally increase the potency of these derivatives against this target."]
