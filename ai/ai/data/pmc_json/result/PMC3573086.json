["Results", "All four cytohesins were transcribed and ARNO was expressed in colorectal cancer cells", "RT-PCR was employed to detect the transcription of the cytohesin family. Cytohesin-1, -2 (ARNO), -3 (Grp1) and -4 were transcribed in all four cell lines, which included HT-29, SW620, SW480 and HCT-116. We found that mRNA of the four cytohesins was transcribed in all four cell lines, and ARNO mRNA had the highest expression level (Fig. 1A). Additionally, by an immunofluorescence assay, we demonstrated that ARNO was highly expressed in HT-29 cells and was located in the cytoplasm, near to the membrane (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the expression of EGFR in colorectal cells was detected by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1C). The expression of EGFR in HT-29 cells was higher than that of the other cell lines. Therefore, the HT-29 cell line was selected for EGF pathway research in the following study.", "siRNA-1 with the strongest inhibitory effects was selected for ARNO blocking", "To select the most effective siRNA for ARNO, three siRNAs (siRNA-1, -2 and -3) were designed to inhibit the expression of ARNO. Expression of ARNO was then detected under the inhibition of these three siRNAs. The greatest inhbitory effect was produced by siRNA-1; the maximum inhibition rate was 49.271%. Therefore, siRNA-1 was selected to be the ARNO siRNA inhibitor that was used in the present study (Fig. 2). The selected ARNO siRNA sequence pair was: 5\u2032-AGTGCATTAAAGCAGCCATCAG-3\u2032, and 5\u2032-TCAGTGTCGCTTCGTGGAG-3\u2032.", "Inhibition of cytohesins reduces EGF pathway signaling in HT-29 cells", "To detect the function of cytohesins in the EGF pathway, cytohesins were inhibited by SecinH3 and ARNO siRNA in HT-29 cells. In the assay, HT-29 cells were cultured in 35 mm glass-bottom dishes, marked as group A, B or C. All cells were cultured with 1% FBS culture medium. SecinH3 (or a mixture of 100 pmol ARNO siRNA in 5 \u03bcl Lipofectamine 2000) was added to dishes from group B when cells had spread to cover 70% of the dishes for 10 h. Simultaneously, 0.2% DMSO (or 5 \u03bcl Lipofectamine 2000) was added to dishes from groups A and C as a control; then 50 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech, Inc.) was added to dishes from groups A and B for 5 min. Western blot analysis was employed to test the expression of the EGF pathway-associated molecules, which included ARNO, EGFR, p-EGFR and p-ERK1/2. The results indicated that when cytohesins were blocked by SecinH3 or inhibited by ARNO siRNA, ARNO expression was reduced in HT-29 cells. Additionally, phosphorylated molecules of the EGF pathway, including p-EGFR and p-ERK1/2, were downregulated in HT-29 cells (Fig. 3).", "Blocking cytohesins inhibits the proliferation of HT-29 cells", "To detect whether cytohesins are involved in the proliferation of HT-29 cells, we used the specific cytohesin antagonist SecinH3 and the EGFR-expressing human colorectal adenocarcinoma-derived HT-29 cells. HT-29 cells were treated with SecinH3 and then proliferation was detected by an MTT assay. DMSO was added to the cell culture medium in the control group. After culture for 24, 48 and 72 h, the inhibition rates of SecinH3 compared with the control group were 56.77, 58.72 and 57.22%, respectively (n=3, Fig. 4A).", "The ARNO siRNA described previously was used as an inhibitor to identify whether ARNO downregulation is capable of reducing the proliferation of HT-29 cells. The MTT assay results demonstrated that the growth and proliferation of tumor cells were significantly inhibited by ARNO siRNA at 24 and 48 h, while the inhibition rates were 68.63 and 58.95%, respectively, compared with the Lipofectamine 2000 group (n=3, Fig. 4B)."]
