["Results", "Irrigation induces a significant change in the soil microbiome", "The ability of irrigation to protect root vegetables against S. scabies infection is agriculturally important and widespread, but poorly understood. It is likely that the irrigated soil microbiota plays a role in mediating scab suppression, but how this occurs is unclear. We therefore assessed the impact of irrigation on the total bacterial population of a commercial potato field in the United Kingdom. Multiple soil samples were taken from two sites (A1 and B1) within this field, immediately prior to potato planting in January. Following potato planting, one site was irrigated as normal (site A), while the second was protected from irrigation (site B). Tuber-associated soil was sampled from both sites in May (A2 and B2) when tubers were just forming, and the plants were most susceptible to S. scabies infection. Total genomic DNA was then extracted from replicate samples of each site after each sampling event, and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to examine the bacterial population in each of these sites (Figure 1).", "Figure 1.Effect of irrigation on the microbial population of a potato field.(A) The 26 bacterial orders whose populations were determined to significantly differ across one or more sampling sites using voom with a false discovery rate of 0.05.

In total, changes were observed for 26 bacterial orders (Figure 1A), with the most significant changes observed between January and May regardless of irrigation. This partially reflects an increase in bacterial orders that have previously been associated with the potato root microbiome (Pfeiffer et al., 2017; Weinert et al., 2011), including Rhizobiales, Sphingomonadales, and Flavobacteriales. Significant population changes (FDR < 0.05) were also observed for eight bacterial orders between the irrigated (A2) and nonirrigated (B2) sites (Figure 1B and C), including a larger proportion of Pseudomonadales bacteria in the irrigated site. In contrast, despite the potential for microbial heterogeneity across the fertilized field prior to planting, no significant changes were observed between pre-planting sites A1 and B1.", "Phenotypic, phylogenetic, and genomic analysis of the P. fluorescens field population", "Taxonomic identifications using 16S rRNA amplicon analysis showed order-level changes to the field microbiome between sites (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1) but were unable to accurately capture diversity within genera or species groups. Therefore, biologically relevant variation within the populations of genetically diverse species groups such as P. fluorescens is potentially overlooked. To investigate the diversity of the fluorescent pseudomonad population, we isolated 240 individual Pseudomonas strains from our pre- and post-irrigation field sites (Supplementary file 1). These strains were screened for multiple phenotypes including motility, protease production, fluorescence (siderophore production), and on-plate suppression of S. scabies using a cross-streak assay (Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2). Each phenotype was scored on an ordinal scale between 0 (no phenotype observed) and 3 (strong phenotype). The cross-streak assay provided a rapid read-out of bacterial antagonism for both contact-dependent and diffusible mechanisms of growth inhibition. On-plate suppression of S. scabies was a surprisingly rare trait, with 79% of Pseudomonas isolates outcompeted by S. scabies in this assay. To determine whether this suppressive activity correlated with specific genetic loci, 69 isolates were selected for whole-genome sequencing, where almost half (32 strains) exhibited on-plate suppression of S. scabies and the remaining strains represented a diverse selection (based on phenotypic variation and 16S rRNA sequencing) of nonsuppressive strains. We hypothesized that a comparative analysis of a similar number of genomes from suppressive and nonsuppressive strains would identify those BGCs that play important roles in suppressive activity.", "The phylogeny of the 69 sequenced strains was analyzed alongside various model pseudomonads, including representatives of the eight phylogenomic P. fluorescens groups defined by Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016. Our sequenced strain collection spans much of this characterized global phylogenetic diversity and contains representatives of at least five of the eight P. fluorescens phylogenomic groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016), as well as strains belonging to the Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas syringae groups (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3). This genetic heterogeneity was also reflected in the diverse specialized metabolome of these strains, as predicted by a detailed analysis of the BGCs encoded in their genomes. Each genome was subjected to antiSMASH 5.0 analysis (Blin et al., 2019), which was further refined by extensive manual annotation to improve the accuracy of predicted pathway products. This second annotation step was particularly important for BGCs that are atypically distributed across two distinct genomic loci (e.g., viscosin and pyoverdine). Our analysis was further expanded to include BGCs not identified by antiSMASH 5.0, including BGCs for hydrogen cyanide (HCN) (Pessi and Haas, 2000), microcin B17-like pathways (Metelev et al., 2013), and the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (McClerklin et al., 2018; Palm et al., 1989). This was achieved by searching the genomes with a curated set of known Pseudomonas BGCs using MultiGeneBlast (Medema et al., 2013) (see Appendix 1 for further details). This manual annotation provided a level of resolution superior to that provided by automated cluster-searching algorithms alone and provided confidence that the majority of natural product biosynthetic potential had been identified. Within a given pathway type (e.g., nonribosomal peptide synthetases [NRPSs]), likely pathway products were assigned where possible (e.g., CLPs) or assigned a code when a conserved uncharacterized BGC was identified (e.g., NRPS 1). All BGCs were mapped to strain phylogeny (Figure 2).", "Figure 2.Comparison of phylogeny, S. scabies suppression (red color scales).P. infestans suppression (green color scale), G. graminis pv. tritici (take-all) suppression (blue color scale), phenotypes (gray color scales), natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (filled circles = presence of a gene or gene cluster), and the accessory genome (separated from biosynthetic gene clusters [BGCs] by a dotted line).

In addition to pyoverdine BGCs (C\u00e9zard et al., 2015) in almost all strains, numerous other siderophore BGCs were identified, including pathways predicted to make achromobactin (Berti and Thomas, 2009), ornicorrugatin (Matthijs et al., 2008), pyochelin-like molecules (Patel and Walsh, 2001; Appendix 1\u2014figure 1), and a pseudomonine-like molecule (Mercado-Blanco et al., 2001). A variety of polyketide synthase (PKS), terpene, and NRPS BGCs with no characterized homologues were also identified (Figure 2). Furthermore, BGCs were identified that were predicted to make compounds related to microcin B17 (Metelev et al., 2013), fosfomycin-like antibiotics (Kim et al., 2012), lanthipeptides (Repka et al., 2017), safracin (Velasco et al., 2005), a carbapenem (Coulthurst et al., 2005), and an aminoglycoside (Kudo and Eguchi, 2009; Appendix 1\u2014figure 3).

All 69 strains had at least one BGC for the production of the electron-transport cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) (Puehringer et al., 2008; Appendix 1\u2014figure 4), reported to function as a plant growth promoter (Choi et al., 2008). Surprisingly, BGCs for numerous well-characterized Pseudomonas specialized metabolites were not found, including phenazine, pyrrolnitrin, or 2,4-diacylphloroglucinol BGCs (Gross and Loper, 2009). In total, 787 gene clusters were identified that could be subdivided into 61 gene cluster families (Figure 2).", "The P. fluorescens species group possesses a highly diverse array of nonessential accessory genes and gene clusters. These are often critical to the lifestyle of a given strain and can include motility determinants, proteases, secretion systems, polysaccharides, toxins, and metabolite catabolism pathways (Mauchline et al., 2015). These accessory genome loci were identified using MultiGeneBlast (details in Appendix 1), which revealed a high degree of genomic diversity across strains. Specialized metabolism BGCs and accessory genome loci were mapped to strain phylogeny (Figure 2), which indicated that for some loci (e.g., the psl operon, auxin catabolism, HCN biosynthesis) there is a close, but not absolute, relationship between phylogeny and the presence of a gene cluster.", "Correlation analysis identifies potential genetic determinants of S. scabies inhibition", "We hypothesized that genes associated with suppression of S. scabies could be identified by a correlation analysis between S. scabies cross-streak inhibition and the presence of BGC families or accessory genes. We therefore calculated Pearson correlation coefficients for each BGC with S. scabies inhibition (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1). The top 10 positively correlating genotypes and phenotypes (Figure 3) comprised four BGC families (Pep1, CLP, Pep2, and HCN) (Appendix 1\u2014figure 2), four accessory genome loci (chitinase ChiC, protease AprA, chitinase class 1, and the Pga operon), and two phenotypes (motility and secreted protease production). The production of HCN and/or CLPs by Pseudomonas strains has been previously associated with the suppression of various plant pathogens including fungi (Michelsen et al., 2015; Zachow et al., 2015) and oomycetes (Hultberg et al., 2010; Hunziker et al., 2015), and can also contribute to insect killing (Flury et al., 2017; Jang et al., 2013), but have not been linked to the suppression of bacteria. A variety of genotypes associated with plant-microbe interactions were moderately negatively correlated with suppression (\u03c1 < \u20130.3), including BGCs for PQQ biosynthesis and catabolism of the plant auxins IAA and phenylacetic acid (PAA) (Figure 3A).", "Figure 3.Correlation of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and accessory genome loci with S. scabies inhibition.(A) Heatmap showing the 10 genotypes and phenotypes that correlated most strongly (positively and negatively) with on-plate suppression of S. scabies.

Correlation does not equate to causation, especially considering the significant evolutionary association seen for some BGCs (Figure 2). The importance of correlating BGCs to S. scabies suppression was therefore investigated experimentally using a genetically tractable subset of suppressive isolates.", "Production and role of CLPs in the suppression of S. scabies", "The strong positive correlation between putative CLP gene clusters and S. scabies suppression prompted us to investigate whether CLPs play a role in suppressive activity. Pseudomonas CLPs have previously been associated with a wide array of functions, including fungal growth inhibition, plant colonization, and promotion of swarming motility (Alsohim et al., 2014; Raaijmakers et al., 2010), although there are no reports of Pseudomonas CLPs functioning as inhibitors of streptomycete growth. However, prior work has shown that surfactin, a CLP from Bacillus subtilis, inhibits Streptomyces coelicolor aerial hyphae development (Straight et al., 2006), while iturin A, a CLP from Bacillus sp. sunhua, inhibits S. scabies development (Han et al., 2005).", "To determine the identity of each CLP, we combined bioinformatic predictions of the NRPS products (Blin et al., 2019) with experimental identification using liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In every strain that contained a CLP BGC, a molecule with an expected mass and MS/MS fragmentation pattern was identified (Figure 4, Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1\u20137). These data showed that P. fluorescens strains from a single field have the collective capacity to make viscosin (m/z 1126.69, identical retention time to a viscosin standard) (de Bruijn et al., 2007), a viscosin isomer (m/z 1126.69, different retention time to viscosin standard) (Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2), as well as compounds with BGCs, exact masses, and MS/MS fragmentation consistent with tensin (m/z 1409.85, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3; Nielsen et al., 2000), anikasin (m/z 1354.81, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4; G\u00f6tze et al., 2017), and putisolvin II (m/z 1394.85, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5; Kuiper et al., 2004). In addition, an array of related metabolites were observed that differed by 14 or 28 Da, which is characteristic of different lipid chain lengths. This analysis also proved that the linear lipopeptides syringafactin A (m/z 1082.74) and cichofactin (m/z 555.38, [M + 2 H]2+) were made by strains harboring BGCs predicted to make these phytotoxins (G\u00f6tze et al., 2019; Pauwelyn et al., 2013; Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 6 and 7).

The resulting Ps682 \u2206visc strain was unable to make the viscosin-like molecule (m/z 1126.69, Figure 5B) or to undergo swarming motility (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1). This is in agreement with earlier work on the role of viscosin in the motility of P. fluorescens SBW25 (Alsohim et al., 2014) and the observation that possession of a CLP BGC was the genotype that most strongly correlated with motility (\u03c1 = 0.65, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1). A cross-streak assay with S. scabies revealed an active role for this CLP in on-plate S. scabies inhibition (Figure 5D). Wild-type (WT) Ps682 appeared to specifically colonize the S. scabies streak, whereas Ps682 \u2206visc was unable to restrict S. scabies growth. Alternatively, it was possible that this instead could reflect diffusible inhibition of Streptomyces development by WT Ps682, leading to a \u2018bald\u2019 S. scabies phenotype (Fl\u00e4rdh and Buttner, 2009). To distinguish between these possible inhibition modes, a constitutively expressed lux operon was integrated into the chromosomal att::Tn7 site (K.-H. Choi et al., 2005) of Ps682 to visualize this interaction by bioluminescence.

NMR analysis revealed that the molecule has an identical amino acid composition to viscosin (3-hydroxydecanoic acid-Leu1-Glu2-Thr3-Val4-Leu5-Ser6-Leu7-Ser8-Ile9, Figure 5B), which was fully supported by detailed high-resolution MS (calculated viscosin [M + H]+ = 1126.6970, observed [M + H]+ = 1126.6964) and MS/MS fragmentation data (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2). The LC retention time of this CLP is different to viscosin, but is almost identical to WLIP (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C), which is a viscosin isomer that has a D-Leu5 residue instead of L-Leu5 (Rokni-Zadeh et al., 2012). However, comparison of NMR data in DMF-d7 revealed some minor shift differences between published WLIP spectra (Rokni-Zadeh et al., 2012) and the Ps682 CLP, such as the \u03b3-CH2 group of Glu2 (WLIP = \u03b4H 2.54 ppm, \u03b4C 30.3 ppm; Ps682 CLP = \u03b4H 2.24 ppm, \u03b4C 34.8 ppm). Therefore, we could not conclusively confirm the absolute configuration of the Ps682 CLP and thus named it viscosin I (for viscosin Isomer). A disk diffusion assay of purified viscosin I with S. scabies (Figure 5C) demonstrated that it directly inhibited S. scabies growth with a minimum inhibitory concentration of approximately 20 \u00b5g/mL. Long-term growth of S. scabies in the presence of viscosin I (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 14) indicated that the inhibition of S. scabies is temporary and growth partially resumes after several days. These data show that in addition to its role as a surfactant viscosin I functions by inhibiting the growth rate of S. scabies, consistent with the on-plate data for Ps682 \u2206visc.", "HCN and CLP production both contribute to on-plate S. scabies inhibition", "Pan-genome analysis showed that HCN production was predicted for a significant number of suppressive strains (\u03c1 = 0.47, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1), where 17 of the 19 strains containing HCN gene clusters were inhibitory towards S. scabies (Figure 2). The HCN pathway is encoded by the hcnABC gene cluster (Appendix 1\u2014figure 2) and has previously been associated with insect and fungal pathogen inhibition in other Pseudomonas strains (Flury et al., 2017; Hunziker et al., 2015; Siddiqui et al., 2006). HCN is toxic to a wide variety of organisms, but not to Pseudomonas owing to their branched aerobic respiratory chain that has at least five terminal oxidases, including a cyanide-insensitive oxidase (Comolli and Donohue, 2002; Ugidos et al., 2008). We confirmed that nearly every strain with the hcnABC gene cluster produced HCN (18 out of 19) using the Feigl\u2013Anger colorimetric detection reagent (Feigl and Anger, 1966; Supplementary file 1) and used this assay to identify HCN producers across the original collection of 240 Pseudomonas strains. This wider analysis showed that HCN production strongly correlated with S. scabies inhibition (\u03c1 = 0.52, Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1), in accordance with our analysis of the sequenced strains.", "To examine the role of HCN in S. scabies suppression and whether it exhibited a synergistic effect with CLP production, Ps619 was investigated as this strain produces both HCN and a tensin-like CLP (Figures 2 and 6A). A tensin BGC has not previously been reported, but the predicted amino acid specificity, mass (Figure 6A), and MS/MS fragmentation (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3) indicated that seven isolates produce tensin-like CLPs (Figure 4). The hcn and ten gene clusters were inactivated by in-frame deletions to generate single and double mutants of Ps619, and the resulting \u0394hcn, \u0394ten, and \u0394hcn\u0394ten mutants were subjected to cross-streak assays (Figure 6B). A comparison of WT, single, and double mutants showed that HCN inhibits S. scabies growth and development across the entire plate, while tensin is important for Pseudomonas motility and helps the Pseudomonas to grow competitively at the cross-streak interface. Furthermore, this suppressive effect is additive: the Ps619 \u0394hcn and \u0394ten single mutants both retained some inhibitory activity towards S. scabies, whereas the Ps619 \u0394hcn\u0394ten double mutant could not inhibit S. scabies.", "Figure 6.The role of the Ps619 cyclic lipopeptide (CLP) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gene clusters in S. scabies suppression.(A) Predicted structure of the tensin-like molecule and liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of CLP production in wild-type (WT) Ps619 and a mutant (Ps619 \u2206ten) with an in-frame deletion of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene 02963 (see Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 for biosynthetic gene cluster [BGC] information).

Notably, Ps619 \u0394hcn was able to induce a developmental defect in S. scabies at the microbial interface that was not present in Ps619 \u0394ten or Ps619 \u0394hcn\u0394ten, showing that the tensin-like CLP induces a developmental defect in S. scabies that is independent of Pseudomonas motility, comparable to the inhibitory effect of isolated viscosin I. This analysis also clearly showed that at areas distant from the bacterial interaction S. scabies grew more vigorously when cultured with \u0394hcn strains, consistent with the volatility of HCN enabling a long-range inhibitory effect. A similar volatile effect was seen when Ps619 strains were separated from S. scabies by a barrier, where only those strains producing HCN inhibited growth and development (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B).", "To further probe how tensin and HCN affected the interaction between Ps619 strains and S. scabies, the interfacial regions of cross-streaks were imaged using cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM). WT Ps619 was able to colonize the S. scabies streak, meaning that the interfacial region imaged was further from the cross-streak intersection than all other co-cultures (Figure 6C). Here, Ps619 inhibited S. scabies development, which appears as a mixture of deformed aerial hyphae and vegetative growth reminiscent of a \u2018bald\u2019 phenotype (Tschowri et al., 2014). Cryo-SEM indicated that both the Ps619 \u0394hcn and \u0394ten mutants induced a similar partially bald phenotype in S. scabies, but the \u0394hcn\u0394ten double mutant was unable to trigger the same developmental defect as S. scabies could develop aerial mycelia close to the microbial interface (Figure 6C, Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3). This appears as a clear boundary between Ps619 \u0394hcn\u0394ten (single cells in background, bottom right panel of Figure 6C) and S. scabies (hyphae in the foreground). The volatile HCN can inhibit growth and development at a distance, whereas CLP inhibition of development only occurs close to the microbial interface. Both inhibitory mechanisms enable Ps619 to obtain a competitive advantage at the microbe-microbe interface (Figure 6C, Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3), while the CLP also functions as a surfactant enabling Ps619 motility, promoting Pseudomonas invasion of the Streptomyces cross-streak.", "Tensin is a key determinant of in planta inhibition of potato scab", "To examine the in planta biocontrol properties of Ps619 and Ps682, and to determine the contribution of HCN and CLPs to activity, potato scab suppression assays were carried out in glasshouse trials. Maris Piper potatoes were infected with S. scabies 87-22 and scored for disease severity after 16 weeks using the method of Andrade et al., 2019. A subset of plants was also treated with Pseudomonas spp. and associated BGC mutants. Ps619 conferred significant protection against potato scab, where disease severity was reduced to levels similar to uninfected control plants (Figure 7). This suppressive ability was lost for Ps619 \u0394ten and Ps619 \u0394hcn\u0394ten, resulting in disease severity similar to scab-infected tubers. In contrast, Ps619 \u0394hcn was just as effective as WT Ps619 at suppressing potato scab, which differed from the on-plate results for HCN. The significance of these results was supported by an independent in planta biocontrol experiment, where equivalent results were obtained for each strain (Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1). This result indicates that tensin plays an important role in the biocontrol of potato scab. In contrast to its on-plate suppressive activity, potato scab assays showed no significant antagonistic activity for Ps682 against S. scabies infection. Unfortunately, this meant that the role of viscosin I could not be determined in planta.", "Figure 7.Potato scab biocontrol assay.The bar chart shows the percentage of diseased tubers following infection with S. scabies (\u2018Scab\u2019) along with treatment by Ps619, Ps682, and associated mutants.

These assays revealed strong congruence between the genotypes that correlated with suppression of each pathogen (Appendix 2\u2014figure 1A). HCN and CLPs have both previously been identified as inhibitors of oomycete and fungal growth (Hunziker et al., 2015; Michelsen et al., 2015). To assess whether these natural products are critical for inhibition of P. infestans and G. graminis by Ps619 and Ps682, the HCN/CLP mutants were tested for inhibitory activity (Appendix 2\u2014figure 1). Surprisingly, neither HCN or tensin were required for Ps619 inhibition of either G. graminis or P. infestans (Appendix 2\u2014figure 1), indicating the production of at least one other secreted inhibitory factor. In contrast, inactivation of the viscosin I pathway in Ps682 abolished activity towards both pathogens (Appendix 2\u2014figure 1D). These data indicate that a subset of pseudomonads can function as generalist pathogen suppressors, possessing multiple growth inhibition mechanisms (e.g., Ps619) and/or by producing molecules with broad bioactivity (e.g., Ps682).", "Multiple other genome loci are strongly correlated with pathogen suppression (Figure 3A, Appendix 2\u2014figure 1A), including chitinases (Folders et al., 2001) and the extracellular metalloprotease AprA (Laarman et al., 2012). Phenotypically, extracellular protease activity also positively correlates with suppression. The BGC that correlated most strongly with S. scabies suppression was Pep1 (\u2018Peptide 1\u2019), while the related Pep2 also correlated strongly (Figure 3A). These were identified by antiSMASH as putative \u2018bacteriocin\u2019 BGCs and encode short DUF2282 peptides alongside DUF692 and DUF2063 proteins (Appendix 1\u2014figure 2). The DUF692 protein family includes dioxygenases involved in methanobactin (Kenney et al., 2018) and 3-thiaglutamate (Ting et al., 2019) biosynthesis. Other studies indicate that DUF692 and DUF2063 proteins may be involved in heavy metal and/or oxidative stress responses (Clark et al., 2014; Price et al., 2018; Sarkisova et al., 2014). Further work is required to determine the significance of both the Pep BGCs and the accessory genome loci for pathogen inhibition.", "The effect of irrigation on the soil Pseudomonas population", "Irrigation is currently the only effective way to control potato scab, so we hypothesized that this may lead to an increase in the number of inhibitory bacteria associated with the soil and/or tuber, especially as the Pseudomonadales population moderately increased in irrigated soil (Figure 1C). However, a greater number of strongly suppressive strains (inhibition score \u22652) were isolated from nonirrigated sites (7/60 strains) than from irrigated sites (1/60 strains). A similar pattern was observed for strongly motile (score \u22652) strains (six nonirrigated versus two irrigated). Analysis of the BGCs in our sequenced strains revealed a similar result, where 5/18 unirrigated strains contained CLP BGCs versus 0/16 irrigated strains. This counterintuitive observation led us to hypothesize that irrigation enables nonmotile, nonsuppressive bacteria to survive and colonize plant roots, whereas highly motile bacteria that produce multiple biological weapons can more effectively colonize plants in drier, more \u2018hostile\u2019 conditions.", "To test these hypotheses, we sampled irrigated and unirrigated sites in a neighboring field 2 years after the first sampling event. 48 strains were isolated from bulk soil and the rhizospheres of tuber-forming potato plants, with and without irrigation, providing a total of 192 P. fluorescens strains (Supplementary file 1). These strains were scored for motility, HCN production, and S. scabies suppression (Figure 8A). Our results were in strong agreement with the first sample set, including strong positive correlations between S. scabies inhibition, motility, and HCN production (Figure 8B). A negative correlation was observed between irrigation and S. scabies suppression on the plant roots, but not in the surrounding soil. This appeared to be driven primarily by differences in the unirrigated samples, where a substantially greater proportion of suppressive isolates were associated with roots than with the surrounding soil. We observed a strong positive correlation between motility and root association for unirrigated samples, while the reverse was true for irrigated plants (Figure 8A). This effect of irrigation on the distribution of motile bacteria was striking \u2013 in dry plants, the motile population was almost entirely associated with roots, while in irrigated plants a comparable proportion of motile bacteria were found in the soil and roots (Figure 8A).", "Figure 8.The effect of irrigation and environment (soil versus root) on the P. fluorescens population.(A) Plots showing the proportion of strains exhibiting a particular phenotype from each environment (n = 48 for each condition). Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production was scored on a scale of 0\u20132 based on a qualitative assessment of the color change in the Feigl\u2013Anger assay. The size of each circle is proportional to the number of strains with a given phenotypic score. Statistical comparisons were carried out using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney tests where ns (not significant) = p\u22650.05, *p<0.05, ** p<0.01, ***p<0.001.

Upon irrigation, the difference between the bulk soil and root pseudomonad populations is much less significant. The mechanism for this population change is not yet defined, and these changes are counterintuitive in relation to the suppression of potato scab upon irrigation, given there is a drop in suppressive strains colonizing the potato root following irrigation. Irrigation did lead to moderately more motile pseudomonads in bulk soil versus unirrigated conditions, but this was not associated with more suppressive strains or HCN producers (Figure 8A and B). The mechanism and significance of this irrigation effect require further investigation. It is possible that a protective microbiome in irrigated conditions actually contains a mixture of S. scabies-suppressive \u2018biocontrol\u2019 Pseudomonas strains alongside other nonmotile pseudomonads that interact with the plant in important ways due to traits usually absent from the \u2018biocontrol\u2019 strains, such as their ability to produce PQQ and catabolize auxins (Choi et al., 2008; Leveau and Gerards, 2008). Profound irrigation-associated changes in antibiotic-producing Pseudomonas populations have previously been observed for the wheat rhizosphere (Mavrodi et al., 2018; Mavrodi et al., 2012)."]
