["Results", "Statins range in herbicidal activity", "Previous studies have shown several statins to exhibit herbicidal activity against several plant species including Lemna gibba, Raphanus sativus, Scoparia dulcis and A. thaliana31\u201333,36,37. However, there is a lack of comparative data regarding the herbicidal efficacy of statins especially for second-generation, synthetic statins. To assess herbicidal activity, we treated a model dicot and a monocot (A. thaliana and Eragrostis tef, respectively) with a dose range of eight commercially available statins on soil, pre- and post-emergence (Fig.\u00a01). All statins were more herbicidal against the dicot and in general were more effective post-emergence. In line with their physicochemical properties more closely matching those of post-emergence herbicides (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). The synthetic statin rosuvastatin was the most herbicidal statin being lethal to A. thaliana at ~15\u2009\u03bcM without formulation beyond including a wetting agent. Given that under the same conditions formulated glyphosate (Roundup\u00ae) is lethal at ~35\u2009\u03bcM (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b, c), we surmised that HMGR could represent a potential herbicide target.Fig. 1Herbicidal activity of statins varies between a model dicot and a monocot.a Representative images from the post-emergence treatment of a model dicot, A. thaliana, and pre-emergence treatment of the monocot E. tef, with statins: rosuvastatin (Ro.), pravastatin (Pr.), simvastatin (Si.), mevastatin (Me.), lovastatin (Lo.), fluvastatin (Fl.), atorvastatin (At.) and pitavastatin (Pi.). b\nA. thaliana (green) and E. tef (grey) treated with a range of statins at 62.5\u2009\u03bcM pre- (light colour) and post-emergence (dark colour) on soil.

The N-terminal transmembrane domains of HMGR are highly divergent between species and absent from class II HMGRs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). By contrast, the conserved extracellular domain of AtHMG1 shares ~54% sequence identity with HsHMGCR and strictly conserved catalytic residues (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). To develop plant-specific statins and mitigate off-target effects, we solved the crystal structure of the core domain of apo AtHMG1 and in complex with pitavastatin to resolutions of 1.9 and 2.1\u2009\u00c5, respectively, in space groupI 41 2 2. Attempts were made to crystallise type I statins as described previously24; however, electron density for these ligands was ambiguous. The structure of the apo AtHMG1 displayed a single monomer in the asymmetric unit which through crystallographic symmetry forms a homotetrameric assembly (Fig.\u00a02a), consisting of two canonical class I homodimeric HMGR folds, with high structural similarity to HsHMGCR (PDB 1HWK, r.m.s.d. 1.1\u2009\u00c5 over 371 C\u03b1 atoms, Fig.\u00a02b).Fig. 2AtHMG1 active site adopts a unique conformation.a Apo AtHMG1 displays a single monomer in the asymmetric unit (dark-blue cartoon) which through crystallographic symmetry forms a homotetrameric assembly (ribbon) consisting of two canonical class I homodimeric HMGR folds (blue and green). b Overlay of human HMGR (orange cartoon, PDB 1HWK) with apo AtHMG1 (a) illustrates their conserved fold. c AtHMG1 (blue ribbon and sticks) has a highly conserved active site with HsHMGCR (orange ribbon and sticks).

Topology designation from HsHMGCR49.", "Closer inspection of the statin-binding pocket revealed two substitutions in AtHMG1 with respect to HsHMGCR located at the hydrophobic CoA binding region of the active site pocket39, specifically, Ile562/Leu857 and Ile389/Val683 in AtHMG1/HsHMGCR respectively (Fig.\u00a02c, d). Furthermore, a plant conserved Val to Pro (Pro236/Val530\nA. thaliana/human) substitution at the start of the L\u03b21-strand is the likely cause of conformational flexibility and lack of electron density in the N\u03b14-L\u03b21 loop adjacent to the active site-delineating L\u03b22-L\u03b11 loop (Fig.\u00a02e, Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a, b and Supplementary Table\u00a01). This flexibility results in the loss of a type II \u03b2-turn found within the HsHMGCR L\u03b22-L\u03b11 loop that is stabilised by hydrogen bonding between a conserved Glu (Glu234/Glu528 AtHMG1/HsHMGCR) and a Cys backbone amine (Cys267/Cys561 AtHMG1/HsHMGCR) (Fig.\u00a02f). This altered conformation of the L\u03b22-L\u03b11 loop is not seen in any of the previous class I and II HMGR crystal structures24,26,30,40\u201350 and allows alternative conformations of the Cys267 residue (Fig.\u00a02e, g, h). Importantly, the arrangement of the AtHMG1 L\u03b22-L\u03b11 loop results in Glu265 being unable to form a hydrogen bond with the O5-hydroxyl group of the HMG moiety of statins or the equivalent thioester oxygen of HMG-CoA, as it is shifted 2.5\u2009\u00c5 away, creating a wider pocket (Fig.\u00a02g). In this orientation it is more likely that Lys397 acts as a proton donor in the catalytic reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate as is suggested to occur in bacteria50 and with molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations with HsHMGCR51. Together, these differences increase the solvent-accessible area of the statin pocket from ~314\u2009\u00c53 in HsHMGCR to ~357\u2009\u00c53 in AtHMG152.", "The complex of AtHMG1 with pitavastatin (Fig.\u00a03a, b) revealed a binding mode highly similar to fluvastatin in HsHMGCR24 (Fig.\u00a03c). Conserved polar interactions occur with the residues local to the cis loop Arg296, Ser390, Asp396, Lys397, Lys398, Asn461 (HsHMGCR Arg590, Ser684, Asp690, Lys691, Lys692, Asn755) and a salt-bridge between the terminal carboxylate of the HMG moiety with Lys441 (HsHMGCR Lys735) (Fig.\u00a03a). The fluorophenyl group of pitavastatin maintains conserved stacking interactions with Arg296 (HsHMGCR Arg590) and hydrophobic interactions between the quinoline and cyclopropyl moiety with residues Leu268, Ile389, Leu558, Asp561 (HsHMGCR Leu562, Val683, Leu853, Asp856). This complex structure however also revealed two notable differences between the binding mode of class II statins in AtHMG1 and HsHMGCR; (i) loss of hydrogen bonding to the O5-hydroxyl group of the HMG moiety of statins from Glu265 (HsHMGCR Glu559), despite a slight shift of Glu265 towards the bound inhibitor (Fig.\u00a03a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c), and (ii) the loss of hydrophobic interactions with Gly266, His458 and Ile562 (HsHMGCR Gly560, His752 and Leu857). Unique hydrophobic contacts were made between pitavastatin and residues Ser271 and Ser367 of AtHMG1 (HsHMGCR Ser565 and Ser661).Fig. 3AtHMG1 E265 does not hydrogen bond with statins.a AtHMG1 with pitavastatin (magenta) bound.

Activity of the atorvastatin scaffold against HsHMGCR was previously found to be reduced with increasing size of the alkyl substituent53 whereas the wider pocket of AtHMG1 might accommodate larger groups. In addition, the loss of interactions with O5-hydroxyl group of the HMG moiety with Glu265 could be targeted by incorporating a hydrogen bond donor (Fig.\u00a02e, g). Thus 1\u20139 were synthesised (Supplementary Method\u00a01) and assessed for herbicidal activity on soil with A. thaliana (Fig.\u00a04a) and for species-specificity against HsHMGCR and AtHMG1 in vitro by a fluorometric, NADPH-depletion assay (Fig.\u00a04b\u2013d).Fig. 4Modifying the isopropyl group of atorvastatin affects species selectivity.a Herbicidal activity of atorvastatin and its analogues (1\u20139) against A. thaliana with pre- and post-emergence treatments.

Sequence alignment of a HMGR gene (lvrA) from the A. terreus genome revealed several mutations in the cluster-associated copy that were not present in the housekeeping copy (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). The corresponding residues of the AtHMG1 crystal structure revealed a Leu (Leu558) to Thr mutation, whose equivalent was conserved in all A. terreus genomes in the NCBI database.

It has previously been shown that overexpressing AtHMG1 in A. thaliana can give rise to a 40-fold rise in mRNA levels and a modest rise in resistance to lovastatin compared to non-transformed WT controls58. Here we found with data collated from 19 independent T2\n35\u2009S::AtHMG1 lines and 14 independent 35\u2009S::AtHMG1-L558T T2 lines that both constructs conferred similar resistance to the selectable marker hygromycin (Fig.\u00a06a, d). However, the 35\u2009S::AtHMG1-L558T lines were over sixfold more resistant to rosuvastatin (IC50 300\u2009\u00b5M vs \u00b118\u2009\u00b5M) than 35\u2009S::AtHMG1 lines (IC50 46\u2009\u00b5M \u00b15\u2009\u00b5M) and more than 100-fold more resistant than non-transformed WT (IC50 3\u2009\u00b5M vs \u00b11\u2009\u00b5M) (Fig.\u00a06b, d). Furthermore, analysis of the effects of rosuvastatin revealed 35\u2009S::AtHMG1-L558T lines were up to 16-fold less sensitive to treatment than 35\u2009S::AtHMG1 lines (Fig.\u00a06c).
