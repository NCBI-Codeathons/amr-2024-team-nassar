["Results", "Genome mining employing griEF as bait identifies the mycoplanecin biosynthetic pathway", "Our search for BGCs including griE and griF homologs in all actinobacterial genomic sequences in the NCBI nuccore and assembly revealed dozens of hits (Fig.\u00a01b and Supplementary Table\u00a01). This mining strategy was effective as it found the BGCs known to produce compounds containing 4-MePro, such as GM4 and acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics10 (Fig.\u00a01b, c). Among the unknown hits which are mainly nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or NRPS hybrid BGCs, one hit similar to the GM pathway drew our attention because it exhibited significant differences. However, only a partial BGC could be recovered due to the low genome sequence quality. This short contig containing griEF homologous genes belongs to the genome of Actinoplanes awajinensis subsp. mycoplanecinus NRRL B-1671211. Additional genes that are absent in the GM pathway were identified, including such encoding a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) protein, an acyl carrier protein (ACP), and a 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) III homolog (Fig.\u00a01b, d). Fortuitously, we found that this NRRL strain is equivalent to A. awajinensis subsp. mycoplanecinus subsp. nov. ATCC 33919 (Strain No. 41042) producing anti-mycobacterial MP peptides discovered in the 1980s12\u201316. Notwithstanding the structural similarity to GM, MPs possess unique characteristics, including the exceptional N-terminal \u03b1-keto butyric moiety, as well as the other two 4-alkylprolines: 4-EtPro and 4-propylproline (4-PrPro), homoleucine (5-Methyl-norleucine), and N-methyl-homonorleucine (N-methylheptanoic acid) (Fig.\u00a02).Fig. 2MP biosynthetic gene cluster and proposed biosynthetic pathway.a The gene organization and comparison of GM and MP biosynthetic gene clusters. b The MP biosynthetic pathway proposal.

The putative MP BGC comprises 15 genes divided into three hypothetical operons that encode NRPSs, precursor biosynthetic enzymes, and a self-resistance protein (Fig.\u00a02a, Supplementary Table\u00a02). We found a DnaN-encoding gene mypR nearby transposase genes, which was also observed for griR in the GM pathway4. Furthermore, mypR is found to be the second DnaN gene in the genome of strain ATCC33919, implying that MPs are potential DnaN inhibitors, and mypR confers self-resistance against MPs3. The majority of genes are clustered in one operon, which encodes NRPSs MypABC, the MbtH protein MypD, redox enzymes MypP (P450), MypE (hydroxylase), and MypF (dehydrogenase), the thioesterase MypG, the discrete ACP MypI, and the ketosynthase MypJ, as well as a radical SAM enzyme MypH. Inconsistencies in the assembly of the NRPS gene mypA caused by repetitive sequences were solved by comprehensive PCR amplification and restriction digestion analysis (Supplementary Figs.\u00a01\u20133). The three gene operon comprising mypKLM is located upstream adjacent to the primary operon and oriented in opposite direction (Fig.\u00a02a). MypK and MypL show sequence similarity to enzymes involved in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis. MypM is a SAM synthetase probably involved in regenerating the cofactor required by MypH.", "MypA, MypB, and MypC comprise six, three, and one single NRPS module, respectively. The substrate specificity prediction of adenylation (A) domains correctly suggested the incorporation of Thr3, Leu4, Pro8, Leu9, and Gly10 (Fig.\u00a02b). The four N-methyltransferase (MT) domains align with the N-methylation of Val1, Thr3, Val7, and Leu9 in MPs. However, modules 1 and 7 were inappropriately predicted to activate Thr instead of Val. Intriguingly, several nonproteogenic amino acid building blocks were found in the biosynthesis of MPs. A6 is predicted to activate ornithine, but l-homoleucine was found incorporated in MPs in this position. The A9 domain has a promiscuous substrate tolerance since l-N-methyl-homonorleucine and l-N-Methyl-Leu are present in different MPs at this position. The substrate specificity of A2, A5, and A8 was predicted as proline, indicating that the current bioinformatic analysis could not discriminate proline from different alkyl-prolines4. The substrate specificity of A2 is flexible as three different 4-alkylproline residues are incorporated in different MP derivatives. However, it is also possible that different 4-alkylproline residues are formed by post-modifications of 4-MePro in MP B (Fig.\u00a02b). It is noteworthy that uncommon genes responsible for lipopeptide chain initiation are found in the MP pathway, partially similar to the proposed pathway for calcium-dependent antibiotics (CDAs)17. Here, it is hypothesized that the holo-MypI (ACP) is either malonylated by the malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT) FabD or functions as a self-priming ACP that widely exists in fatty acid biosynthesis18,19. Subsequently, the KAS III-like enzyme MypJ extends the acyl chain by a molecule of acetyl-CoA to form the acetoacetyl-S-ACP species, which is probably reduced to butyryl-S-MypI by reductases from the type II fatty acid biosynthesis. A P450-dependent oxidase encoding gene mypP is assumed to be responsible for the cryptic \u03b1-keto group formation, albeit the mechanism and oxidation timing are still unexplored (Fig.\u00a02b, Supplementary discussion).", "Isolation and structure elucidation of MPs with unusual building blocks", "Mycoplanecins were first investigated four decades ago due to their activity against Mycobacteria while possessing low cytotoxicity, but no subsequent studies are known from the literature. The absolute configurations of MPs are not completely clear12\u201316, nor is the biosynthesis or the molecular target. Given the presence of the putative self-resistance gene mypR and the finding of novel biosynthetic genes, we re-isolated these potent anti-tubercular compounds aiming to identify unprecedented derivatives for subsequent characterization.", "The three most abundant derivatives were purified and structurally elucidated as the previously described MP A, B, and D (Fig.\u00a03a)12,13,15. A complete set of 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments was acquired for each derivative to underpin the structures and to supplement previous MP spectral data (Supplementary NMR Data)12,13,15. The last derivative isolated, MP E, is structurally novel with a 4-PrPro and a N-methyl-homonorleucine residue incorporated, the largest of the MPs (Fig.\u00a03a). Comprehensive studies of COSY, HSQC and HMBC spectra indicate the presence of \u03b1-ketobutyrate, N-methyl-valine, leucine, 4-methylproline, 5-methylnorleucine, proline, glycine and N-methyl-threonine analog to the known derivatives MP A, B and D. Furthermore, the spectral data reveal that MP E contains the same 4-propylproline moiety as described in MP D, which is substituted by 4-methylproline in MP A and 4-ethylproline in MP B. N-methylleucine found in MP A, B and D is replaced by the rare N-methylheptanoic acid building block in MP E. This moiety is characterized by the three methylene signals at \u03b4(1H)\u2009=\u20091.16 (2H, m) \u03b4(13C)\u2009=\u200938.9, \u03b4(1H)\u2009=\u20091.26 (2H, m) \u03b4(13C)\u2009=\u200927.3 and \u03b4(1H)\u2009=\u20091.64 (2H, m) \u03b4(13C)\u2009=\u200924.9 as well as the more shielded methyl signal at \u03b4(1H)\u2009=\u20090.90 (3H, m) \u03b4(13C)\u2009=\u200914.1 ppm. Besides this, the chemical shifts of the remaining structure of MP D and MP E exhibit a deviation of less than 0.12 ppm for \u03b4(1H) and 2.5 ppm for \u03b4(13C) (Supplementary NMR Data). We proposed the stereochemistry of all derivatives through Marfey\u2019s analysis and biosynthesis analysis, confirming that MP A comprises N-methyl-valine, 4-EtPro, leucine, 4-MePro, proline, N-methyl-threonine in l-configuration while N-methyl-leucine is the only d-configured amino acid underlined by the only epimerization (E) domain (Fig.\u00a02b and Supplementary Figs\u00a021-28, 35\u221241, 48-55, 60-67).Fig. 3Chemical structures and bioactivity of MPs.a The chemical structures of MPs isolated in this study. b The comparison of bioactivity of MPs and GM against Mycobacteria and dissociation constants against DnaN from M. smegmatis mc2155.

Additional MPs tested against M. smegmatis revealed potent activity from 0.0625 to 0.5\u2009\u00b5g/mL. Although MPs remain relatively effective against a GM-resistant M. smegmatis strain3 with MIC values ranging between 4 to 8\u2009\u00b5g/mL, there was a clear MIC shift (ranging between 16 to 64-fold), indicating that mycoplanecins have the same target as GM. It should be noted that resistance against griselimycins is associated with severe fitness loss in the mutants3. While MPs were less potent against the virulent M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv than the attenuated H37Ra, they still exhibit an impressive ~24-fold more potent bioactivity than GM (Fig.\u00a03b). Surprisingly, the best MIC was 0.083\u2009\u00b5g/mL for the new congener MP E, while the MIC of GM is 2\u2009\u00b5g/mL. MPs were additionally tested against a panel of Gram-positive (S. aureus Newman and B. subtilis DSM 10) and Gram-negative (E. coli BW25113, C. freundii DSM 30039 and A. baumannii DSM 30008), but exhibited no activity up to 64 ug/mL (Supplementary Table\u00a06). The mycobacteria-specific inhibitory bioactivity of MPs highlighted the high selectivity of this compound class, also concerning members of the human microbiota that are likely spared in the potential use of MP in TB therapy. In addition, MPs showed no cytotoxicity against CHO-K1 cells up to a concentration of 37\u2009\u00b5g/mL, which underpins the high potential of MPs in the application to combat mycobacterial infections. DNA damage response after exposure to MP A was evaluated in M. smegmatis reporter strains harboring mycobacterial promoters that drive the expression of DNA damage-inducible genes, recA and radA. Strong induction of luminescence was observed for the reporter strains upon treatment with 2x MIC MP A, indicating that the target of MPs is involved in DNA metabolism that results in genotoxic stress. (Fig.\u00a03c, d).", "MPs bind to DnaN in nanomolar affinity", "The homology of the self-resistance gene griR from the GM BGC with mypR in the MP BGC and MPs\u2019 structural analogy to GM implied that DnaN is the molecular target of MPs. We determined the binding affinity of all isolated MPs as well as GM to DnaN by microscale thermophoresis (MST). The highest affinity to M. smegmatis DnaN (msDnaN) was observed for GM with KD\u2009=\u20096.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9\u2009nM. Lower DnaN binding affinities were determined for MPs as the KD-value for MP A was 95.4\u2009\u00b1\u200958.0\u2009nM while MP B showed strongest binding to msDnaN among the congeners with a KD\u2009=\u200924.4\u2009\u00b1\u200911.9\u2009nM. The other two MPs showed a similar binding range to msDnaN (Fig.\u00a03b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Interestingly, GM manifests a slightly stronger DnaN binding affinity than the MPs but is less active than MPs against mycobacteria. This intriguing phenomenon is unresolved but is likely a result of MPs\u2019 improved physicochemical properties including increased lipophilicity, which is important for TB activity.", "Crystal structure of DnaN in complex with MP A", "Although the co-crystal of msDnaN and MP A could not be obtained after intensive attempts, DnaN of E. coli (ecDnaN) was overproduced in E. coli and co-crystallized with MP A, GM and cyclohexyl-GM (CGM). Despite sharing only 29 % sequence identity with msDnaN, the binding pocket of ecDNA shows a sufficient degree of conservation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). The crystal structures were solved at resolutions of 2.12\u2009\u00c5 (MP A), 1.65\u2009\u00c5 (GM) and 1.50\u2009\u00c5 (CGM) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06 and Supplementary Tables\u00a08, 9). MP A was found to bind in the same mode to ecDnaN as GM or CGM. The binding pocket can be divided into a larger (subsite 1) and a smaller cavity (subsite 2) and as has been shown previously for GM and mycobacterial DnaN, all compounds occupy both subsites of the binding pocket. All three substances form hydrogen bonds to only 2 \u2013 3 protein residues, but the additional oxygen in the N-terminal \u03b1-keto butyrate residue of MP A provides a second hydrogen bond acceptor for Arg365 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07), which is also conserved in mycobacterial DnaN. The compounds bind mainly via van der Waals interactions with interfaces ranging from 550 \u00c52 for GM to 590 \u00c52 for CGM to 600 \u00c52 for MP A. Compared to available structures of uncomplexed DnaN, only a few residues undergo significant conformational changes upon binding of the compounds - most notably Met362, which has been described to function as a gate between the subsites (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08)20. The linear, N-terminal part of the ligands in subsite 2 superimposes almost perfectly, while MP A seems to be tilted slightly (approximately 7-10 \u00b0 compared to GM/CGM) away from the protein in the region around Pro8. This tilting can be attributed to the longer 5-methyl-l-norleucine residue of MP A at position 6, whereas leucine is present at the same position in GM and CGM (Fig.\u00a04 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). The comparison with the previously published mycobacterial GM/DnaN complexes shows that whereas the N-terminal parts of the ligands in subsite 2 superimpose very well, there is higher variance on the opposite side of the molecules around Pro8 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). In the complex with msDnaN, GM adopts a conformation very similar to that of MP A in the ecDnaN complex, although GM lacks the 5-methyl-l-norleucine at position 6 and the residues lining the protein pocket around this position are conserved between mycobacteria and E. coli. In complex with M. tuberculosis DnaN, the tilt of GM away from the protein is less pronounced, instead the macrocycle seems to be tilted approximately 7\u00b0 towards positon 7 in comparison to the msDnaN complex. Although differences in crystal packing make a direct comparison of the binding strength difficult, the linear part of the ligands (1-3) and the residues adjacent to the bifurcation (4-5, 10) seem to be bound tighter/show less flexibility than the opposing residues (6-9) in all structures of DnaN/GM complexes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010).Fig. 4Binding of MP A to ecDnaN.a Superimposition of the ecDnaN co-crystal structures containing MP A (8CIZ, dark/light green for the two entities in the asymmetric unit), GM (8CIX, orange), and CGM (8CIY, violet).

For instance, 4-ethyl-l-proline/4-propyl-l-proline, l-homoleucine, and l-homonorleucine as present in MPs, often contribute to the bioactivities whereas their biogenesis remains mysterious. We proposed the biosynthesis of the homo-amino acid residues in MPs as biosynthetically sharing an analogous process to leucine biosynthesis, as previously also suggested for a few other homo-amino acids. Two homologous genes of leucine biosynthesis were identified within the MP BGC. mypK encodes a 2-isopropylmalate synthase-like enzyme that likely catalyzes the condensation of different six-carbon \u03b1-keto acids, including 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (1), 2-oxohexanoate (2), and 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (3) with acetyl-CoA. The other gene encodes a didomain enzyme MypL, which contains a putative N-terminal isopropylmalate isomerase subunit (LeuD) homolog and a C-terminal pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminase domain. Although the dedicated dehydrogenase (leuB) and the other isopropylmalate isomerase subunit (leuC) genes were not found in the MP pathway, the broad substrate tolerance of leucine biosynthesis enzymes was nevertheless considered to be important for homo-amino acids biosynthesis as well21. Thus, MypK, MypL, together with aaLeuB and aaLeuC from primary metabolism of A. awajinensis ATCC 33919, were proposed to biosynthesize the homo-amino acid residues (10,\n11, and 12) (Fig.\u00a05a).Fig. 5The homo-amino acid building blocks of MPs are built by a pathway mimicking BCAA biosynthesis.a Proposed subpathway and intermediates of l-homoleucine (10), l-homonorleucine (11) and l-homoisoleucine (12) formation.

We speculated that MypE/F form 4-MePro as described in the GM pathway (Fig.\u00a06b). However, the timing of subsequent methylation by the radical SAM MT MypH is still elusive (Fig.\u00a06c). MypH might iteratively methylate the unreactive methyl-carbon of nascent substrates at different stages, including the \u03b1-keto acids before chain elongation, the homo-amino acids before hydroxylation by MypE, or 4-MePro (Fig.\u00a06c). In addition, we can not exclude that 4-EtPro and 4-PrPro-containing MPs could be produced by modifying MP B by MypH as a post-assembly tailoring enzyme.Fig. 6The biosynthesis of alkylproline residues in MPs.a MS analysis of production of MPs by fermentation without (I: MP B, III: MP A, V: MP D) or with (II: MP B, IV: MP A, VI: MP D) l-Methionine-(methyl-13C). b Proposed subpathway of 4-EtPro and 4-PrPro formation in MP biosynthesis. c Potential methylation timepoints by MypH. d UV/Vis spectra of MypF and heat-inactivated MypF in the assay.", "Fig. 6The biosynthesis of alkylproline residues in MPs.a MS analysis of production of MPs by fermentation without (I: MP B, III: MP A, V: MP D) or with (II: MP B, IV: MP A, VI: MP D) l-Methionine-(methyl-13C). b Proposed subpathway of 4-EtPro and 4-PrPro formation in MP biosynthesis. c Potential methylation timepoints by MypH. d UV/Vis spectra of MypF and heat-inactivated MypF in the assay.", "The biosynthesis of alkylproline residues in MPs.", "a MS analysis of production of MPs by fermentation without (I: MP B, III: MP A, V: MP D) or with (II: MP B, IV: MP A, VI: MP D) l-Methionine-(methyl-13C). b Proposed subpathway of 4-EtPro and 4-PrPro formation in MP biosynthesis. c Potential methylation timepoints by MypH. d UV/Vis spectra of MypF and heat-inactivated MypF in the assay.", "The formation of 4-hydroxymethyl-l-homoisoleucine (13) was observed as a new mass with a 16\u2009Da increase in the d-FDLA derivatized reaction product of recombinant MypE incubated with homoisoleucine (stereoisomer mixture) since the pure (2\u2009S,4\u2009R)-homoisoleucine is not commercially available. Surprisingly, three individual new peaks with the same m/z were observed after derivatization by d-FDLA, suggesting loose stereospecificity of MypE (Fig.\u00a07b). A series of structural analogs were investigated for substrate tolerance of MypE, but no conversion was detected with l-valine, d-isoleucine or d-allo-isoleucine. In contrast, a trace amount of products of d-leucine and l-isoleucine, and nearly complete conversion of l-leucine and l-allo-isoleucine was observed by LC-MS (Fig.\u00a07b). These results indicated MypE is a promiscuous enzyme recognizing substrate stereoisomers, however, preferring l-forms of amino acids, especially the l-allo form amino acid in the case of two stereocenters.Fig. 7In vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis of homo-amino acid and alkylproline residues.a In vitro analysis of the extender unit reconstitution.
