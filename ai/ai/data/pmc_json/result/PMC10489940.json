["3. Results", "3.1. Effect on the TMA Productivity of the Medicinal Herbal Extract", "In our previous study, the microbiota analysis performed on the cecal samples collected from dysbiosis-induced mice by ethanol feeding showed that the relative abundance of putative RF32 order, which has been reported to correlate with the serum TMAO level [16], was increased by ethanol intake [15]. In the present study, we first tried to compare the TMA concentration of the cecum samples in ethanol-fed mice (PC group) with a negative control group of mice (NC group; without ethanol feeding). However, the TMA concentrations could not be determined by spectrophotometric assay [28,29], which may have been due to its measurement limit. Thus, we measured and compared the TMA production in the cultured broth of the cecum samples (Figure 1). The results showed that ethanol feeding altered the cecal contents to have latent TMA productivity (about 15-fold). Thus, we used the TMA production level as an indicator of cecal dysbiosis.", "Next, whether or not the medicinal herbal extract altered the latent TMA productivity was confirmed by using 20 kinds of extract (Figure 2). When compared with the without-extract sample, some of the herbal extracts reduced the TMA production, especially in Gardeniae Fructus (ID 19) and Lycium Fructus (ID 20). On the other hand, the extracts from Glycyrrhizae Radix (ID 1) and stevia (leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, ID 2) showed marked TMA inducibility.", "3.2. Inhibitory Activity Alteration of Medicinal Herbal Extract before and after LAB Fermentation", "Among the tested samples, the extracts from Gardeniae Fructus and Lycium Fructus were used for further study to compare the anti-TMA production activity of the herbal extracts before and after LAB fermentation. In this study, 10 kinds of LAB strains, which were isolated in our research group and expected to be useful and helpful for human health care (Table 1), were used to ferment these herbal extracts. As compared with the unfermented extract of Gardeniae Fructus, the fermented extracts by LP28, LY45, and SN35N strains showed relatively higher reduction abilities against TMA production (Figure 3A), whereas, in Lycium Fructus, the anti-TMA activity of the fermented extracts tended to be reduced (Figure 3B). Based on these results, these three strains were used for further analysis.", "To further confirm the effect of LAB fermentation on the herbal extracts, we again compared the inhibitory activity against the TMA production of all of the tested herbal extracts before and after LAB fermentation (Figure 4). Among the three strains, the activity seemed to be improved in the LY45-fermented extracts. Interestingly, LAB fermentation markedly decreased the TMA induction observed in the unfermented extracts from Glycyrrhizae Radix and stevia, especially by LY45 fermentation. Because Glycyrrhizae Radix contains a large amount of glycyrrhizin, which has been recognized to counteract antihypertensive medications by its pseudo-aldosterone effect [31,32], the LY45-fermented stevia extract was used for the additional in vivo verification experiment.", "3.3. Improving the Effect of Fermented Stevia Extracts on Alcohol-Poisoning-Model Mice", "The LY45-fermented or unfermented stevia extracts were orally administrated, and the differences in their effect on improving alcohol-poisoning-model mice before and after fermentation were evaluated (Figure 5). The improvement observed in hepatic parameters AST and ALT, which significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the ethanol-fed group (positive control, PC), as compared with the negative control group (NC, without ethanol-feeding), were not significant in the unfermented group (Unf), but were significant (p < 0.05) in the fermented group (Fer) (Figure 5A,B). Similar results were observed in LDH, but there were no significant differences among the treatment groups (Figure 5D). When the latent TMA productivities of the cecal contents collected from each mouse were compared, the increased TMA production observed in the PC group was repressed in the Fer group, with statistical significance (p < 0.05, Figure 5G). In the other items, there were no noticeable effects caused by the treatments.", "3.4. Alterations of Cecal Microbiota", "The cecal microbiota of the alcohol-poisoning-model mice treated with the samples were also compared (Figure 6 and Table 2). We focused on the increased (which became detectable or increased by four times or more) or decreased (which became non-detectable or decreased by four times or more) categories after ethanol feeding. The abundance of some genera (Allobaculum, Sutterella, Lactobacillus, Adlercreutzia, Anaerofustis, and Prevotella) was remarkably decreased by the administration of ethanol; however, of those, only Adlercreutzia was found to be restored by taking the fermented (Fer) or unfermented (Unf) stevia extracts. On the other hand, although the ratio of Escherichia, Bacteroides, Enterococcus, SMB53 (putative), and Dorea genera were notably increased by ethanol feeding, these phenomena disappeared with the administration of the fermented stevia extract. The increased abundance of Lactococcus, Clostridium, and Staphylococcus also observed in the ethanol-fed group (PC) was not restored by the extracts. Only in the Streptococcus genus, which also increased in the PC group, did it remain unrestored in the Fer group, but not in the Unf group. The unfermented stevia extract also improved the Bacteroides alteration."]
