["Results and discussion", "In vitro/in vivo characterization of Orf1", "BD-12 features an unusual N-formimidoyl functional group at the terminus of its glycyl sidechain in contrast to a typical ST that displays primary amine groups at its oligo(\u03b2-Lys)n sidechain. Previously, we identified the BD-12 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in Streptomyces luteocolor NBRC 13826 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01) and heterologous host strains (Streptomyces lividans TK23 and Streptomyces avermitilis SUKA17) expressing the BGC that produces BD-12(ref24). It has been known that the glycyl moiety is transferred to streptothrisamine by a Fem-like enzyme (orf11) at the expense of one molecule of Gly-tRNA to form 1 prior to the addition of the N-formimidoyl group24. The orf1 gene that encodes a N-formimidoyl fortimicin A synthase-like enzyme in the BD-12 BGC was thought to commit the formimidoylation reaction in the presence of glycine27. To confirm this hypothesis, the orf1 gene was inactivated by an in-frame deletion and introduced into S. avermitilis SUKA17. The resulting transformant, SUKA17-BD-12-\u0394orf1, was cultured and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-HR-ESI-MS). Compared to TK23-BD-12, carrying the BD-12 biosynthetic gene cluster (wild type), the deletion of orf1 abolished the biosynthesis of BD-12 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b). In a further HPLC-HR-ESI-MS analysis of the culture broth, the TK23-BD-12-\u0394orf1 strain was shown to produce a compound (m/z 460.215 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+) rather than BD-12 (m/z 487.226 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+). The mass decrease by 27\u2009Da was in good agreement with the fact that the orf1 gene homologous to an N-formimidoyl synthase gene was inactivated; the \u039427 Da compound seemed to be 1. To confirm the chemical structure of 1, it was purified from the culture broth, and NMR analysis clarified that compound 1 is indeed glycinothricin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02; Supplementary Table\u00a01). Moreover, these results strongly suggested that 1 was the biosynthetic precursor of BD-12 and a substrate of the orf1 gene product (N-formimidoyl synthase).", "Two glycylation reactions executed by two different types of enzymes in a row are rare if any. The N-formimidoyl modification is peculiarly intriguing as a barrage of reactions apparently goes with the territory starting with free glycine oxidation and ending on a bulky recipient with a unique N-formimidoyl substitution. To explore this fascinating issue, recombinant Orf1 expressed in E. coli displays yellow tetrameric proteins in the solution while eluting out of gel filtration chromatography (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a, b). The yellow color indicates each polypeptide chain harbors a flavin prosthetic group as opposed to the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), which is a copper I dependent enzyme39. This yellow cofactor was determined to be flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) by subjecting the supernatant of denatured proteins to LC-MS analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c). Biochemical assays were performed in parallel, wherein reaction mixtures containing glycine and a chemically synthesized glycylthricin (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 4) instead of 1 were quenched in due course and subjected to LC analysis. When compared with the control (addition with denatured Orf1), a new peak that emerged on the LC trace matched with the synthetic standard in the same retention time, mass unit and fragmentation pattern, suggesting that Orf1 is a flavin-dependent enzyme capable of N-formimidoylating the terminal glycyl sidechain of glycylthricin to 5 in the presence of glycine. To confirm that the N-formimidoyl moiety is derived from an intact molecule of glycine, we performed Orf1-mediated reactions with the addition of glycine, (15N)-glycine, (1\u221213C)-glycine, (2\u221213C)-glycine, (2\u221213C \u221215N)-glycine, or (1,2\u221213C2\u221215N)-glycine alongside 4. LC-MS spectra clearly demonstrate that the N-formimidoyl group is derived from one intact molecule of glycine by an increment of 1 or 2\u2009Da respectively from (15N)- or (2\u221213C \u221215N)-glycine but no change from (1\u221213C)-glycine (Fig.\u00a02a, b). In the EIC (selected at m/z 459.2) trace a small peak emerged other than 5 (Fig.\u00a02a), indicating an N-iminoacetyl-glycylthricin (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 6) as shown by gaining 44\u2009Da of a carboxyl group. The 6 was further confirmed given an increment of 3\u2009Da in the presence of (1,2\u221213C2\u221215N)-glycine, where the moiety of 5 in the spectra suggested it is a daughter ionic fragment of 6 (Fig.\u00a02c). The enzymatic reactions in the presence of ST-F (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 7) alongside glycine or isotopically labeled glycine suggested that the product is N-iminoacetyl-ST-F (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 8) (Fig.\u00a02d, e). NMR analysis of 8 purified from the reaction mixture revealed that the N-iminoacetyl group was attached to the \u03b5-amino group of the \u03b2-lysine moiety (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04; Supplementary Table\u00a02).Fig. 2The biochemical examinations for Orf1 and mutants thereof against glycylthricin and ST-F.a The EIC traces of formimidoyl-glycylthricin (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 5) (m/z 459.2 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+) for reactions catalyzed by (i) denatured Orf1, (ii) Orf1, (iii) C281A, (iv) C281S, (v) E312A, or (vi) F316A. b Mass spectra of 5 produced in the Orf1-mediated reactions in the presence of 4 and (i) glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009459), (ii) 15N-glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009460), (iii) 1-13C-glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009459), or (iv) 2-13C-15N-glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009461). c Mass spectra of iminoacetyl-glycylthricin (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 6) produced in the Orf1-mediated reactions in the presence of 4 and (i) glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009503), or (ii) 13C2-15N-glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009506). d The EIC traces of ST-F (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 7) (m/z 503.2 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+) and iminoacetyl-ST-F (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 8) (m/z 574.2 [M\u2009+\u2009H]+) for reactions catalyzed by (i) denatured Orf1, (ii) Orf1, (iii) Orf1 with addition of DTT, (iv) C281S, (v) R342A, (vi) C281S and R342A, (vii) ThiO and R342A, (viii) E426Q, (ix) E312A, or (x) F316A. e Mass spectra of the Orf1-mediated reactions in the presence of ST-F and (i) glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009574), (ii) 15N-glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009575), (iii) 1-13C-glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009575), (iv) 2-13C-15N-glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009576), or (v) 13C2-15N-glycine ([M\u2009+\u2009H]+\u2009=\u2009577).

Among these, only amikacin and sisomicin were found N-formimidoylation (Supplementary Figs.\u00a07, 8). We subsequently assayed Orf1 versus synthetic 3-aminopropionylthricin (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 9), 4-aminobutylthricin (Fig.\u00a01a, compound 10) or 7 in the presence of glycine. Surprisingly, in addition to the N-formimidoyl modification, a new N-glycine imine akin to that in kasugamycin was found amid the selected acceptors40, where the ratio of N-glycine imination versus N-formimidoylation is positively proportional to the length of the sidechain (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). The N-glycine imination is unexpected and perplexing as it is somewhat in conflict with the general FAD-mediated decarboxylation reactions (see below). Both the N-formimidoylation and -glycine imination are useful biotransformations concerning diversity-oriented diversification/complexification, not least a strategy to counter aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (e.g. aminoglycoside-acetylating enzyme, AAC) to avoid drug resistance (see below).", "Crystal structures and substrate-binding sites", "Regarding the glycine-derived formimidoyl transfer reaction, it must proceed through a multitude of chemical reactions as mentioned above. Our instinct tells us that the enzyme should be similar to a typical FAD-dependent monooxygenase, where the oxidized imino acid intermediate should undergo a nucleophilic attack of FAD-associated peroxide, thus resulting in an oxidative decarboxylation consequence. However, an issue that arises right away is when the addition and transfer reaction take place and how it works out in sequence at the same reaction site. To crack the reaction order and corresponding mechanisms, we took advantage of X-ray crystallography, whereby snapshots of complexes in phases may help illustrate the overall reaction continuums. At the protein level, Orf1 is a flavoprotein similar to glycine oxidases ThiO and GO (both are members of the glutathione reductase 2 (GR2) family of proteins)41,42 containing two domains: one for FAD binding and the other for substrate binding (the Dali Z-score and r.m.s.d. are 41.7 and 2.4\u2009\u00c5 (359\u2009C\u03b1 atoms)43, respectively). Orf1 is a protein of 491 amino acid residues longer than ThiO or GO by an additional 100 or so residues at the sequence level, which is folded into 12 \u03b1-helices and 17 \u03b2-strands into a three-dimensional (3D) structure (Fig.\u00a03a, b). It has a quaternary structure of four subunits (tetrameric) in solution. The 3D structure of Orf1 in the presence of glycine was crystallized and determined at 1.9\u2009\u00c5 as illustrated in Fig.\u00a03a, wherein an asymmetric unit contains 8 polypeptide chains as a result of the low-symmetry P1 point group. The quaternary structure of Orf1 was confirmed by PDBePISA with an immense tetrameric buried area (11390 \u00c52)44. Each individual polypeptide chain is folded into three structural domains, a FAD binding domain, a substrate binding domain and a twisted 4-helix bundle domain (additional 100 C-terminal residues in consistency with sequence analysis), which has no known function with no equivalents in all GR2 family proteins reported thus far (see below, Fig.\u00a03b), presumably taking part in protein-protein interaction at the quaternary structure level.Fig. 3Overall structures of Orf1.a Orf1 is a tetrameric complex of a dimer of dimers in solution, of which each protomer contains a FAD prosthetic group. b Each protomer is comprised of three domains, a FAD binding domain (red), a substrate binding domain (green) and a C-terminal domain (blue).

The FAD prosthetic cofactor in Orf1 is akin to that in other GR2 subfamily proteins, where the binding site is distant from the monomer-monomer interfaces. It adopts an extended conformation with the isoalloxazine ring compartmentalizing the FAD-binding domain and the glycine-binding domain that sits above the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013f).", "The compartment divided by the FAD cofactor is enclosed by four splayed \u03b2-strands curving around the isoalloxazine ring with two loop regions that define the glycine binding site (Fig.\u00a03f). The crystals treated with glycine or sarcosine showed an extra electron density where the \u03b1-C atom of glycine or sarcosine is best described as a sp3 configuration. Except for G55 and H284, the residues A54, M57, R368 and R342 that surround the glycine/FAD reaction center are conserved between Orf1 and ThiO in the secondary and ternary sequence level (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010). The glycine is anchored in place by: (a) N\u03b72 and N\u03b5 of R342 that H-bond with the terminal carboxylate of glycine (2.8 and 2.9\u2009\u00c5) and \u03c0-stack with the guanidine group of R368; (b) the \u03b1-C atom of glycine is at a H-bonding distance to the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring (3.0\u2009\u00c5); (c) the amine group of glycine forms a H-bond with the carbonyl group of R368 (2.9\u2009\u00c5).

Moreover, R342 is another conserved residue in GO (glycine oxidase), DAAO (D-amino acids oxidase) and SOX (sarcosine oxidase) that electrostatically interacts with the COO- group of substrates42,45,46.", "An appreciable volume of a cavity (539 \u00c53) close to the FAD/glycine binding site was initially considered the glycylthricin binding site, as it appears accessible through a narrow entrance for the glycyl side chain of glycylthricin to reach the oxidized glycine (Fig.\u00a03f; Supplementary Fig.\u00a011a). The true binding site, however, is located at the tetrameric inter-junction entwined by the C-terminal four-bundle domains on the opposite side of the one misdeemed. This site will not be known until the determination of the glycylthricin-glycine-Orf1 ternary complex structure (Fig.\u00a03g; Supplementary Fig.\u00a012), where it is composed of two neighboring domains with a tangible volume of 1415 \u00c53 (Fig.\u00a03h). Glycylthricin resides nicely inside the cavity lined by interacting residues (F279, R306, S310, E313, E312, T423, E434, W435, M438, T466 and F470). Specifically, the carbamoylated D-gulosamine and streptolidine lactam moieties are held by residues E434, T423, T466 and E312 through H-bonding networks (Fig.\u00a03i; Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). The side chains of E312 and E434 likely experience significant conformational changes upon substrate binding (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). Mutant E312A confirmed the necessity of changes in recognizing substrates, whereby the binding affinity versus ST-F dropped 10-fold, in addition to losing the reactivity to form 8 (Fig.\u00a02d (ix); Supplementary Table\u00a03). Both glycylthricin and 4-aminobutylthricin (10, a product analog) were observed in the same cavity in structures, suggesting that it is an intrinsic binding site for glycylthricin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012a, b). However, the glycine amine of glycylthricin is distant from the \u03b1-C atom of glycine in the glycine binding site as far as 13.5\u2009\u00c5 (Fig.\u00a03j). Geographically, the antiparallel-\u03b2-sheet (\u03b211- \u03b215) of the glycine binding domain serves as a physical barrier, separating glycylthricin from glycine. Such an arrangement negates multiple reactions in one site but instead supports two separate but adjacent reaction centers. Namely, the reactive product generated from glycine oxidation in the FAD-mediated reaction is safeguarded and swiftly transferred to the glycylthricin binding site, allowing subsequent addition, decarboxylation, dehydration reactions to proceed towards the N-formimidoylated or N-iminoacetylated modification in order.", "Identification of a covalently-modified adduct at C281", "In the Orf1-glycine complex structure, an extra chunk of electron density extended from the terminal thiol group of C281, which was unexpectedly spotted (the only residue out of 12 cysteine residues in a single polypeptide chain) at the glycylthricin binding site, a location next door to the glycine binding cavity and 14.7\u2009\u00c5 away from the N5 of FAD (Fig.\u00a03j). This electron density appears to exhibit two different lobes a short one and an extended one (at the \u201cH subunit\u201d of the structure) (Fig.\u00a04a). For the latter, it best fits with a trans glycine imine-N\u2013O\u2013S-C281 species based on the density contour, a structure reminiscent of the NOS bridge recently reported in transaldolases (NgTAL), where a covalent crosslink between cysteine and lysine residues was determined as an allosteric redox switch (see below, Fig.\u00a04b, c)47. We found that the geometric properties of the glycine imine NOS bridge (N-S distance 2.64\u2009\u00c5, NOS angle 119.9\u00b0, N-O distance 1.4\u2009\u00c5 and O-S distance 1.65\u2009\u00c5) fully comply with the criteria defined by Tittmann et al. for a NOS bridge in proteins48. The C281 residue, nonetheless, is in a reduced form in all polypeptide chains in the structures added with no glycine. It is worth noting that each data set collected from crystal diffraction of X-ray has an accumulated average absorbed dose of 0.67 MGy, which is far lower than the dose needed to provoke radiation damage thereby suggesting that the C281-adduct is not a result of X-ray radiation but rather an intrinsic NOS covalent adduct. We reasoned that the thiol group is subject to reactive oxygen species (ROS, e.g. H2O2)-mediated cysteine oxidation to form sulfenic acid (Fig.\u00a01c), a relatively short-lived transient species, which is pivotal to its transformation to other oxidative post-translational modifications (e.g., sulfinic acid (Fig.\u00a05a) and disulfide bond)49.Fig. 4The glycine imine-N\u2013O\u2013S-C281 bridge in the Orf1-glycine complex structure.a An intrinsic electron density (contrasted by 2Fo-Fc map contoured at 1 \u03c3 in gray and the Fo-Fc map contoured at 3 \u03c3 in green) was unexpectedly found nearby residue C281 at the glycylthricin binding site. b The chemical model that best fits into the electron density region (2Fo-Fc map at 1 \u03c3 colored blue) is a glycine imine adduct in a covalent linkage to C281 through a N\u2013O\u2013S bridge. c The C281-iminoglycine adduct is surrounded by residues T298, E312, E313, F316 and E426.

Biochemical assays confirmed that the both residues and the NOS bridge are essential for the reaction to proceed, as neither one led to the end product (Fig.\u00a02a (iii, iv), d (iv, viii)). In contrast, both C281A and E426Q mutants still exhibited similar glycine oxidation activity, and the R342A lost the glycine oxidation ability but held the same ST-F binding affinity as the wild type (Supplementary Table\u00a03). In terms of conformations, the mutants showed no difference from the wild type except for the sidechain of R368 in the R342A mutant (Fig.\u00a03e, k). Residue R342 turned out to be critical because the sidechain of R368 was misplaced by intruding into the glycine binding site as manifested in the crystal structure of R342A (Fig.\u00a03e). Next, we performed coupled assays to detect the end product to see if it could be formed by complementary pairs C281S/R342A or ThiO/R342A (Fig.\u00a02d (vi, vii)). No product was found, suggesting that (1) glycine imine (the product of ThiO) is not the intermediate for R342A (with intact C281); (2) the first-reaction-phase product formed by C281S is water-labile and unable to transfer undamagedly from C281S to R342A. Given that 4 is in close proximity to the C281-S\u2013O\u2013N-glycine imine adduct (see below), the reactions, such as addition, decarboxylation, and dehydration, are likely to take place in sequence towards the formation of N-formimidoyl-glycylthricin. We also observed that 90% of the enzyme activity was lost when reactions were conducted in a DTT-containing (100\u2009mM) reaction solution, likely because glycine oxidation cannot proceed and/or C281 is fully reduced (underscoring the essentiality of the post-translational modification) (Supplementary Table\u00a03). The residues nearby the C281-adduct include T298, E312, E313, F316 and E426 (Fig.\u00a03c), of which F316, E312 and E313 may cooperatively allow nucleophilic addition and cofactor-free decarboxylation reactions to proceed in sequence. Our reasoning is that F316 stabilizes the planar imine glycine adduct through the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction. The importance of this residue was ascertained by mutational experiments, whereby F316A brings on 6 as the major product (Fig.\u00a02a (vi)). Overlaying two complexes (the C281-adduct and the glycylthricin-containing structures) reveals that the glycylthricin ligand is positioned by residues E312 and E313 in place, making the terminal amine group of glycylthricin in close proximity to the \u03b1-carbon of the oximinoacetate adduct by 3.1\u2009\u00c5 with a Burgi-Dunitz angle of 99.7\u00b0 an approach trajectory (Fig.\u00a04d, e). The nucleophilicity of the terminal amine may be enhanced after deprotonation by the main chain carbonyl group of N299 (2.7\u2009\u00c5). The attack of the amine group from the re face onto the F316-stabilized C281-adduct should reconfigure the planar (sp2) trans imine to a tetrahedral (sp3, S-configuration) geminal diamine species, whereby the \u03c0-\u03c0 stabilization no longer holds. The charged carboxyl group is neutralized after the entropy-driven decarboxylation reaction ensuing in response to the repulsion force incited between the charged and hydrophobic groups. The left electron lone pair could flow into the \u03c3-antibonding orbital of the nitrogen atom of the anti-periplanar N\u2013O\u2013S bridge in a way akin to an E2-like elimination reaction, which differs to the canonical PLP or thiamine-dependent (both cofactors serving as an electron sink) decarboxylation reactions. E312 another key residue collaborates with F316 to facilitate the decarboxylative reaction by introducing a repulsive electrostatic force. The fact is that the residue experiences a substrate-induced conformational change bringing the terminal carboxylate group in a short distance (3.3\u2009\u00c5) to the carboxylate group of the oximinoacetate moiety (Fig.\u00a04f; Supplementary Fig.\u00a013) evidenced by mutational experiments whereby compound 6 becomes the major product in the presence of E312A (Fig.\u00a02a (v)). As a result, E312 undergoes a substrate-induced conformational change, in which upon addition the induced decarboxylation should facilitate \u03b2-elimination. On the other hand, superposition of the F316A-ST-F and C281-adduct complex displays that the long side chain of ST-F is subject to a geographic effect (Fig.\u00a04g), resulting in flipping of the amide group away from E312 to accommodate the entire aliphatic sidechain. This posture is somewhat unexpected as the \u03b5-amine of the \u03b2-lysine is a bit extended away from the \u03b1-carbon of the oximinoacetate adduct likely due to the absence of the phenyl ring (F316A). E312 not only recognizes the streptolidine base but also ushers the \u03b2-lysine to crawl into the binding site in a compact manner. In this context, E312A is able to catalyze the formation of 5 and 6 but no more 8, as opposed to F316A, which catalyzes the formation of 8, the dominant product (Fig.\u00a02a (v), d (ix, x)).", "Catalytic mechanisms", "Since the glycine imine is not the intermediate based on the coupled assays (ThiO/R342A and C281S/R342A), a glycine imine-like reactive intermediate produced at the FAD-reaction center should act on the relatively electrophilic sulfur of C281-SOH to give rise to the glycine imine-N\u2013O\u2013S-C281 adduct. This reactive species is not trappable because of water lability. This reactive species formed at the first reaction center is tunneled to the second one, where it is placed with its carboxylic group in association with the Glu426-water dyad. One tunnel that possibly channels the oxidized glycine into the N-formimidoylation site was located using CAVER 3.0 there are four predicted tunnels around the FAD/glycine reaction center one for the oxidized glycine channeling and the other three for entrance of glycine, (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011a)53. Five residues that constitute the tunnel and would block the intermediate tunneling if mutated were individually made (L124D, L124E, A278V, A280S and H419Y). Except for insoluble L124E, all the mutants L124D, A278V and H419Y lost the N-iminoacetylation activity unable to form 8, while they are still structurally sound and active for glycine oxidation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011b, c). The intermediate should be analogous to N-OH-glycine imine or equivalents (e.g., glycine epoxide (carboxyl oxaziridine), or cyclic glycine peroxide) (Fig.\u00a01c). This given setting aligns the nucleophilic hydroxylamine towards the electrophilic sulfur atom of C281-SOH, resulting in the trans oximinoglycine with a N\u2013O\u2013S covalent linkage to the protein. The adduct is stabilized by the Glu426-water dyad through a low barrier H-bond (2.5\u2009\u00c5) and poised for a nucleophilic addition reaction with glycylthricin as described above. To our knowledge, the NOS-mediated decarboxylation is unorthodox to all known biological decarboxylation reactions, not least \u03b1-amino acids that typically require a pyridoxal-phosphate cofactor30. The protein-NOS-mediated decarboxylation reaction empirically follows the heterolytic ionic mechanism because no radical signal was detected by EPR as that of glycyl radical enzymes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d). Notwithstanding other likelihoods, several oxime-like precedents do exist. For instance, the plant cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (Cyp79A1) in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin is a close example54,55. Cyp79A1 catalyzes two consecutive N-hydroxylation reactions to yield N,N-(OH)2-tyrosine, which then undergoes dehydration and tautomerization to \u03b1-nitrosocarboxylic acid. The resulting \u03b1-nitroso species serves as an electron sink and is protonated intermolecularly by the terminal carboxylic acid leading to (E)-p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime (retaining the N\u2013O linkage) upon decarboxylation. In the present study, the N\u2013O linkage of oximinoglycine is cleaved as a consequence of nonoxidative decarboxylation, whereby C281-SOH is pushed away in a good leaving group manner. On the other hand, given ST-F the reaction gives rise to N-iminoacetyl glycinthricin, where the terminal carboxylic group is retained and the N\u2013O bond undergoes dehydration afterwards. This N\u2013O\u2013S bridge acts as though a linkage rod with two scissile bonds. The chain length of the nucleophile is another determinant, of which the stress/strain provoked in the binding site as well as the trajectory of the nucleophilic addition reaction together leverages the bond cleavage at either the nitroxide (N\u2013O) or sulfur oxide (O\u2013S) site (Fig.\u00a01c).", "Orf1 counteracts SttE", "Almost all ST BGCs encode a ST-resistant N-acetyl transferase (NAT), a self-resistance enzyme, that acts on STs. Given the sttE gene encoded in the Streptomyces lavendulae BCRC12163, the gene product was expressed and subjected to probe its drug resistance scope. A new major peak emerged on the LC trace in a reaction solution containing acetyl-CoA, glycylthricin and SttE when compared with control in which SttE was omitted or glycylthricin was replaced by N-formimidoyl glycylthricin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014). The mass-spectrometric analysis showed that the molecular weight of the peak is increased by 42\u2009Da in the solution containing 4, suggesting that glycylthricin but not 5 is subject to N-acetylation. In the microbial susceptibility assay, the E. coli test strain that harbored a sttE-containing plasmid displayed a diminished inhibition zone, in which glycylthricin or ST-F was added, indicating that SttE is a ST-modifying enzyme and the N-fomimidylation or N-iminoglycination is antagonistic towards the acetylation of SttE (Supplementary Fig.\u00a015). The bifunctional aminoglycoside modifying enzyme AAC(6\u2019)-Ie-APH(6\u201d)-Ia inactivated glycylthricin by N-acetylation to some extent in in vitro assay (Supplementary Fig.\u00a016)56, while the N-formimidoylated glycylthricin was not sensitive to this given modifying enzyme. It is likely owing to the steric hindrance, reaction orientation as well as the reduced nucleophilicity of the sp2\nN-formimidoyl group of 5 where the double bond may resonate between two nitrogen atoms at the terminal of the side chain.", "We then determined the structures of SttE in complex with ST-F or glycylthricin with CoA, of which crystals were packed in space group P1 and P212121 and determined at resolutions of 2.42 and 2.36\u2009\u00c5, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017). The structure of SttE revealed a single core domain of a general control non-derepressible 5 (GCN5)-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) architecture, which is composed of seven extended \u03b2-strands and three \u03b1-helices. Both the extended strand \u03b27 and \u03b2-hairpin between \u03b1A and \u03b22 establish the substantial protein interface promoting protein dimerization, where D164 specifically interacts with R101 and W139 via electrostatic interactions. These binary complexes identified two ligand-binding sites where strands \u03b23 and \u03b24 splay out evolving a typical \u03b2-bulge motif. The AcCoA donor sits astride the fork with the acyl head facing the sidechain of the glycylthricin acceptor. The AcCoA binding site is composed of \u03b24, \u03b1B, \u03b25 and \u03b1C. Glycylthricin, on the other hand, is held by interacting residues (K75, F59, P60, D63, G54, W98, E105, D106, E141, T143, L167, Y168, S173 and E176), which as a whole define the ST binding site. In brief, residues D63, E141 interact with the guanidino group of streptolidine lactam by three H-bonds, while residues S176 and E176 associate the carbamoylated D-gulosamine with two H-bonds. The amine group is in close proximity to the sulfur atom of CoA in distances of 3.3\u20134.8\u2009\u00c5 (c.f. SttE-glycylthricin vs. SttE-ST-F). D106 appears to be the base deprotonating the \u03b2-amine group for the acetylation modification to take place, while it is a bit far away from the terminal amine group of 4. Its nucleophilicity, nonetheless, may well be enhanced by two mainchain oxo groups (E105 and E141), thus accounting for the equivalent activity of SttE towards 4 and 7 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017c).", "In this study we report on a noncanonical FAD-dependent enzyme, Orf1, classified in the group-transferase protein family that contains two adjacent but separate reaction centers. The first center runs a FAD-mediated oxidation-oxygenation dual reaction to give rise to a N-hydroxyl glycine imine-like product in a net 4-electron oxidation manner. The second center is 13.5\u2009\u00c5 away from the first one, where residue C281 plays an indispensable role. To become a fully active enzyme, the sulfhydryl group of C281 undergoes a post-translational modification with ROS (e.g., leaking H2O2 from the FAD-dependent reaction) to sulfenic acid (Fig.\u00a05b). The sulfenic group is capable of reacting with an oxygenated glycine imine species passed down from the first reaction center via a subtle one-way tunnel to form the NOS-covalent adduct. This enzyme-bound adduct then reacts with glycinothricin or glycylthricin following a barrage of chemical reactions, including nucleophilic addition, cofactor-free decarboxylation, \u03b2-elimination and dehydration, to bring on BD-12 (N-formimidoyl glycylthricin). This group-transfer modification is unprecedented as it seamlessly integrates two unrelated chemical strategies at two separate locations in one single enzyme by utilizing oligomerization to invent a second reaction center/substrate binding site. The resultant N-formimidoylation is no longer sensitive to AAC aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, a biochemical strategy that the producing strain evolved to reinvigorate its armory to counter the orthodox drug-resistance mechanism leveraged by competing species. The substrate scope of the enzyme is not limited to the innate ones but is expandable at both ends of donors and acceptors, thereby befitting as a versatile biocatalyst in view of diversifying/complexifying privileged compounds. The NOS-mediated chemistry catalyzed by Orf1 should not be the sole case, the sequence fingerprint characterizing the activity associated with this type of chemistry may guide in finding more enzymes featuring the same mechanism (Fig.\u00a01c)."]
