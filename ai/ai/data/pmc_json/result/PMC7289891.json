["Results", "A total of 66 articles were selected and then divided into dynamic and/or isometric/isokinetic short-duration maximal exercises. Forty-four articles assessed time-of-day effects on dynamic short-duration maximal exercise performance, including swimming, tennis, jumping, cycling, sprinting and resistance exercises (Table\u00a01). On the other hand, 32 articles assessed time-of-day effects on isometric and isokinetic exercise performance, including electrically induced contractions, reflex contractions, maximal and submaximal voluntary isometric contractions, isokinetic leg contractions and magnetic stimulation of the cortex (Table\u00a02). Most articles compared time-of-day effects on short-duration maximal exercise performance under acute exercise conditions; however, 11 articles assessed time-of-day effects on short-duration maximal exercise performance after a period of training (from 5 to 10 weeks) (Tables\u00a01 and 2).Table 1Summary of the literature about time-of-day effects on dynamic short-duration maximal exercise
