["2. Results", "2.1. Phenotype Microarrays", "Phenotype microarrays were performed as detailed in the Methods section and a summary of the results is presented in Table 1. For the purposes of comparative analyses, substrates were divided into four categories on the basis of growth as determined by OD750 readings as follows: (1) little to no growth: OD750 = 0\u20130.15, (2) poor growth: OD750 = 0.15\u20130.3, (3) moderate growth: OD750 = 0.3\u20130.6, and (4) robust growth: OD750 > 0.6). Amongst the 190 carbon sources tested, R. lauricola showed little to no growth on 122 (64%) of these substrates (Supplemental Figure S1, Note: in all instances compounds and/or conditions that resulted in little to no growth are listed in the Supplemental data section). These compounds included acetoacetic acid, sorbic acid, and both d and l galactonic acid-\u01b4-lactone. R. lauricola showed poor growth on 51 carbon sources (27%), including pectin, d and l arabitol, and salicin; moderate growth on 16 substrates (8%), including gentiobiose, \u01b4-cyclodextrin, and d-glucosamine, and robust growth on only 1 compound (0.5%), gelatin (Figure 1).", "R. lauricola showed little to no growth on 57 (60%) out of 95 simple nitrogen sources tested (Supplemental Figure S3). These substrates included histamine, d-serine, and d-lysine. R. lauricola showed poor growth on 26 compounds (27%), including ammonia, nitrate, and l-arginine, and moderate growth on 12 substrates (13%), including d-glucosamine, and the dipeptides, gly-asn, and ala-asp (Figure 2). No robust growth was noted for any of the simple nitrogen substrates tested. Amongst an additional 282 peptide nitrogen sources tested, R. lauricola showed little to no growth on 114 (40%) of these, including val-tyr-val, pro-hyp (hydroxy proline), and asp-trp (Supplemental Figure S3). R. lauricola showed poor growth on 129 compounds (46%), including arg-met, leu-ser, and ser-asp, moderate growth on 39 substrates (14%), including arg-ser, thr-arg, and arg-arg. No robust growth was noted on any of these peptide nitrogen sources tested. R. lauricola was capable of at least poor growth on all of the 94 phosphorus and sulfur sources tested. Poor growth was seen on 28 compounds (30%), including thiophosphate, S-methyl-l-cysteine, and tetramethylene sulfone (Figure 1). R. lauricola showed moderate growth on the remaining 66 compounds (70%), including pyrophosphate, l and d-methionine, and inositol hexaphosphate. No robust growth was noted for any of the phosphorus and sulfur sources tested. An additional 94 different nutrient supplements were tested as potential growth substrates, and R. lauricola showed little to no growth on 81 (86%) of these including l-proline, spermidine, and l-ornithine (Supplemental Figure S2). R. lauricola showed poor growth on 9 substrates (10%), including glutathione (reduced form), folic acid, and thiamine, and moderate growth on 4 compounds (4%), including nicotinamide, orotic acid, and cytosine. No robust growth was noted on any of the nutrient supplements tested (Figure 1).", "High sensitivity to a number of osmotic stress and denaturant conditions was noted for R. lauricola. Among 96 conditions tested, R. lauricola showed little to no growth under 48 (50%) conditions, including 5\u201310% NaCl, 2\u20136% sodium formate 2\u20136%, and 3\u20137% urea (Figure 3). R. lauricola showed poor growth on 12 substrates (13%), including 1\u20134% NaCl, 200 mM sodium phosphate pH 7, and 4% potassium chloride, moderate growth on 32 substrates (33%), including 6% NaCl + trehalose, 1\u20136% sodium lactate, and 10\u201380 mM sodium nitrate, and robust growth on 4 compounds (4%), including 100 mM sodium nitrate, 2\u20133% sodium sulfate, and 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7. Interestingly, loss of growth in 6% NaCl was rescued by the addition of sarcosine, dimethyl sulfonyl propionate, MOPS, N-acetyl-l-glutamine, GABA, trehalose, or trigonelline (Figure 3). Amongst 96 different pH conditions tested, R. lauricola showed little to no growth on 39 (41%), including under alkaline conditions, i.e., pH 8\u201310, as well as in the presence of a number of supplements added at pH 9.5, and poor growth on 15 conditions (16%), including within the lower pH ranges (3.5 to 4) (Figure 3). R. lauricola showed moderate growth on 36 conditions (38%), including within the pH ranges 5\u20137. Robust growth was seen for 6 conditions (6%), including at low pH (pH 4.5) supplemented with l-homoserine or l-glutamic acid. Of note, the alkaline sensitivity of R. lauricola could be rescued by the addition of either l-leucine or l-norleucine (at pH 9.5). Under one condition, pH 9.5 + l-tyrosine, an artificially high reading was noted, as the substrate precipitated out of solution during incubation, forming an opaque layer at the bottom of the well. Within this panel of compounds, a series of 12 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl- (X-) linked substrates were included. Cleavage of the X-moiety results in the release of the indicated carbon sources, and thus these substrates reflect enzymatic activities that include esterases (C8), \u03b1- and \u03b2-galactosidases, \u03b1- and \u03b2-glucuronidases, \u03b2-glucosamidases, \u03b2-galactosamindases, \u03b1-mannosidases, alkaline-phosphatases, and aryl-sulfatases. R. lauricola displayed from moderate to robust growth on all X-linked substrates, with the exception of X-caprylate (Figure 3).", "Among the 120 chemicals tested in chemical sensitivity assays, R. lauricola showed little to no growth on 31 (26%) (Figure 4). These chemicals included sodium azide, sodium cyanate, and zaragozic acid A. R. lauricola showed poor growth on 59 compounds (49%) including in the presence of nystatin, malic acid, and tobramycin (Figure 4). Moderate fungal growth was seen on 30 compounds (25%) that included EDTA, hygromycin B, and chloroquine.", "2.2. R. Lauricola Fatty Acid Utilization", "Fatty acid utilization and mobilization has been linked to a wide variety of fungal pathogenic processes. The growth of R. lauricola on a range of fatty acids (at 0.05%) was examined in standard (PDA) media and in PDA media amended with 0.05% butyric acid (C4), hexanoic acid (C6), octanoic acid (C8), decanoic acid (C10), lauric acid (C12), myristic acid (C14), palmitic acid (C16), and oleic acid (C18) (Figure 5). Fatty acids below chain length C12 completely inhibited the growth of R. lauricola, whereas the fungus showed robust growth on fatty acids C12\u2013C18. However, a number of differences in colony morphology were noted on the different fatty acids. On standard PDA media, fungal colonies formed as a thick mat of mycelia at the inoculation point that spread and become thinner and more web-like as growth emanated towards the edges of the plates (Figure 5). Colonies were also noted to begin as a tan color and darken to a yellow color with age (15 d incubation). Compared to the standard PDA plate, colonies growing in the presence of oleic, myristic, or lauric acid became pigmented earlier (12 d), whereas pigmentation in plates containing palmitic acid occurred as on standard media (15 d); however, at this time, these colonies appeared to be the most brightly pigmented amongst the conditions tested.", "2.3. Assessment of Fluorescent Lipid Dyes for Lipid Droplet (LD) Visualization", "In order to further probe the dynamics of lipid utilization, a total of five different lipid dyes: Lipi-Blue, Lipi-Red, Lipi-Green, Nile Red and BODIPY were evaluated to determine their relative efficacies in visualizing lipid droplet (LD) physiology in R. lauricola. Fungal cells were grown over a 24-h time course in standard liquid media (potato dextrose broth, PDB) and PDB supplemented with 0.05% oleic acid and aliquots were taken and stained with the various dyes as detailed in the Methods section. Representative images of R. lauricola cells grown in PDB and stained with the Lipi-dyes; i.e., either Lipi-Red, Lipi-Blue, or Lipi-Green revealed weak staining of initially germinating (12 h) R. lauricola conidia with the Lipi-Green and Lipi-Red dyes, and a somewhat clearer staining of punctate (LD) structures within the cells when using the Lipi-Blue dye (Supplemental Figure S4). Both an increase in intensity and overall staining of LDs could be seen over the examined time course of cell (hyphal) growth, i.e., at the 16, 20, and 24 h time points using Lipi-Red. Less consistent results were seen using the Lipi-Green and Lipi-Blue dyes (Supplemental Figure S4). Staining of R. lauricola cells grown in PDB supplemented with 0.05% oleic acid, showed a marked increase in staining using Lipi-Red, particularly at the later time point. Similarly, Lipi-Green staining was increased and LDs easier to visualize in PDB + oleic acid grown cells, whereas inconsistent/no clear increases were seen using the Lipi-Blue dye.", "Both BODIPY and Nile Red showed clear staining of large globules in R. lauricola conidia harvested from PDA plates (Figure 6 and Supplemental Figure S5). Subsequent growth in PDB and PDB amended with 0.05% oleic acid revealed conidium and emerging germ tubes (12 h time point) and discrete punctate staining of LDs in growing hyphae. Signals were enhanced 2\u20136 fold over a similar time course of R. lauricola cells grown in PDB supplemented with oleic acid as compared to unamended PDB, with Nile Red showing a clearer increase in response over the time course examined. Quantification of the observed fluorescent signals was performed for samples stained with the BODIPY and Nile Red dyes, and these data revealed higher fluorescence in oleic acid treatment groups as compared to control (PDB) groups (Supplemental Figure S5). Nile Red fluorescence was initially similar between control and supplemented groups during early timepoints; however, fluorescence intensity increased dramatically in the oleic acid-treated group whereas the intensity remained relatively stable in the control group. BODIPY fluorescence was observed to be consistently higher in the oleic acid-treated group compared to the control group across all timepoints, although to a lesser degree than Nile Red. Based on these results, we selected Nile Red and BODIPY as the best candidate lipid dyes for use in further LD visualization experiments.", "2.4. Lipid Droplet Physiology: Effect of Different Fatty Acids", "As BODIPY and Nile Red were demonstrated to give the most consistent results in terms of LD staining in R. lauricola, the analyses of LD formation was extended to growth on other fatty acids including lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids. Fungal cells were grown on the indicated fatty acids (0.05% and including unamended PDB and PDB + oleic acid) and aliquots of cells harvested over a time course (12\u201324 h) and stained with either BODIPY or Nile Red (Figure 7). As compared to LD physiology in un-supplemented media, a number of different LD phenotypes were observed: (1) strong induction of LD formation by oleic acid, as noted by larger and brighter punctate spots of fluorescence distributed across cells, (2) intermediate induction of LDs in myristic and palmitic acids, and (3) diffuse, less intense, (BIODIPY or Nile Red) signals, that were evenly distributed across the entire length of most conidia and hyphae in the presence of the shortest fatty acid chain length tested (that allowed for growth), namely lauric acid (C12). Furthermore, growth appeared stunted in the presence of lauric acid, with shorter swollen/bulging hyphae noticeable. Comparisons between Nile Red and BODIPY-stained samples within corresponding treatment groups revealed generally comparable LD distribution and size/shape; however, in the lauric acid-grown samples, diffuse fluorescence gave way to punctate spots of fluorescence at later time points using Nile Red, but not with BODIPY, suggesting that the two dyes may have slightly different lipid affinities and thus may provide useful complementary information on lipid droplet physiology when used in parallel."]
