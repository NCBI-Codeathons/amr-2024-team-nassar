Prior to sequencing, the competence of this strain as a tetromadurin producer was tested. A. verrucosospora NRRL B-18236 was fermented for seven days on oatmeal agar followed by LC-MS analysis of the organic extract, where tetromadurin ([M+Na+] = 783.8, \u03bbMAX = 252 nm, 300 nm (MeOH)) was clearly detectable (S2 Fig).", "Whole-genome sequencing was then performed using a combined shotgun and long-range mate pair MiSeq approach. The genome was assembled into a single 10.215 Mbp scaffold (Genbank: CP053892) and analysed by AntiSMASH 4.0 [16] to identify biosynthetic gene clusters. Only one of the detected biosynthetic gene clusters, ca. 110 kbp and featuring 32 genes (CP053892:2037887\u20132164555), possessed the biosynthetic features likely required for tetromadurin biosynthesis. The exact boundaries of the tetromadurin biosynthetic gene cluster (the mad gene cluster) were decided on the basis of flanking genes whose annotation suggested no obvious connection with tetromadurin biosynthesis (such as primary metabolism). The proposed functions of the genes in the mad gene cluster, predicted using BLAST [17], is presented in Fig 2. A diagram of the spatial organisation of the mad gene cluster is presented in Fig 3.

No thioesterase (TE) domain is present in any of the modules, as expected for a polyketide tetronate pathway [18]. The loading PKS module (MadAI_KS_LM) could be differentiated from the extension modules by its KS domain catalytic cysteine being replaced by a glutamine (KSQ domain) (S3 Fig) [19]. The order in which the remaining PKS enzymes process the tetromadurin intermediate was then predicted based on the agreement of the proposed product with the actual structure of tetromadurin. The linear polyketide predicted by ordering the PKS enzymes MadAI-MadAVII (13) (i.e, MadAI initiates tetromadurin biosynthesis and performs two extension cycles before transferring the nascent polyketide chain to downstream to MadAII etc\u2026) is in near perfect agreement to the linear polyketide we predicted from retrobiosyntheic analysis of tetromadurin itself (14) (Fig 6). The placement of the C5-C6, C10-C11, C12 and C13 double bonds in 14 was guided by the recently isolated partially cyclised tetronasin intermediate [7].", "10.1371/journal.pone.0239054.g006Fig 6Hypothetical ACP-bound linear tetromadurin backbone.13: the hypothetical linear tetromadurin intermediate predicted to be produced by the MadAI-MadAVII arrangement. 14: the hypothetical linear tetromadurin intermediate predicted from the structure of tetromadurin itself.", "Hypothetical ACP-bound linear tetromadurin backbone.", "13: the hypothetical linear tetromadurin intermediate predicted to be produced by the MadAI-MadAVII arrangement. 14: the hypothetical linear tetromadurin intermediate predicted from the structure of tetromadurin itself.", "The substrate selectivity of the acyltransferase (AT) domains were predicted from the presence of specific amino acid motifs, particularly the presence of a (H/T/V/Y)AFH (acetate-incorporating), or (Y/V/W)ASH (propionate-incorporating) motif (S4 Fig) [20\u201322]. The AT domain of the loading module contains the hybrid HASH motif, previously found in modules with a relaxed selectivity that can incorporate both malonyl-CoA and (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA [23]. However, no congener of tetromadurin with one fewer methyl group has been reported, indicating that (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA is still specifically recruited by the loading module. The AT domain of module 13 (MadAVI_AT_13) contains a YASH motif, indicating selectivity for a (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA. However, based on the structure of tetromadurin this module should actually incorporate (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP to form the C4 methoxy group. The selectivity motifs of AT domains that incorporate (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP are poorly defined and typically resemble either a malonyl-CoA or (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA selective domain [24]. However, given the mad gene cluster contains the genes to synthesise (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP (discussed below), it is likely that MadAVI_AT_13 really is selective for this uncommon extension unit.", "With one exception, the tally of reducing domains present in each module is also consistent with the structure of tetromadurin. Modules 2, 4, 8, and 11 all contain a ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and enoylreductase (ER) domain, consistent with complete saturation at C27, C23, C15, and C9, respectively (S5 Fig). Since modules 4 and 11 incorporate propionate units, the ER domains in these modules also determine the configuration of the C33 and C37 \u03b1-methyl groups, respectively. These ER domains both contain amino acid motifs associated with the d-configuration (lacking the key tyrosine residue) [25], consistent with the d-configured \u03b1-methyl substituents at these positions (S5 Fig).", "The DH domains of modules 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, and 13 are all appropriately placed to form the \u237a-\u03b2 double bonds at C29, C25, C19, C13, C11, and C5, respectively. Although module 5 contains a DH domain, C21 contains a hydroxyl group in the final tetromadurin structure, suggesting that MadAIII_DH_5 is inactive. Closer examination of MadAIII_DH_5 confirmed this inactivity, as it is missing the tyrosine from the YGP motif. The tyrosine side chain of the YGP motif in DH domains is proposed to assist binding to the \u03b2-hydroxyl group of the substrate [19] and has been shown experimentally to be essential [26]. The remaining DH domains all appear to be active (S6 Fig).", "KR domains exert significant stereochemical influence over growing polyketide chains, determining the stereochemistry of the \u03b2-hydroxyl group and (where appropriate) the \u03b1-group of each extension unit. In the proposed MadAI-MadAVII module order, the KR domains of module 5, 7, and 12 are appropriately placed to form the hydroxyl groups at C21, C17, and C7, respectively. In the case of tetromadurin, all backbone \u03b2-hydroxyl groups and the \u03b1-methyl groups adjacent to these hydroxyls (C35 and C38) are in the d-configuration, indicating the activity of B1 type KR domains [19]. The distinguishing features of a B1 KR domain are an (L,V,I)DD motif and the absence of a proline (a feature of B2-type KRs) two residues C-terminal of the catalytic tyrosine [27, 28]. Protein sequence analysis confirmed that the KR domains from modules 5 and 7 are indeed B1, but modules 12 and 14 and appear to be inactive (S7 Fig). The module 12 and 14 KR domains both lack the key catalytic tyrosine residue, with module 12 also containing a deletion in its NADPH binding site [19, 29]. While the inactivity of KR_14 is consistent with the C3 keto group of tetromadurin, the inactivity of KR_12 is not. An inactive KR domain at this position should result in a keto group at C7 rather than the C7 d-hydroxyl group observed in the tetromadurin (Fig 6). Module 12 also contains a seemingly active DH domain that should reduce a C7 d-hydroxyl by a C6-C7 trans double bond. How the tetromadurin C7 hydroxyl group is formed is therefore unclear.", "Genes for tetronate biosynthesis", "The mad gene cluster contains homologues of all five glycerate-utilisation operon [18] genes: mad7, mad8, mad16, mad17, and mad18. mad7 and mad8 respectively encode a FkbH-like protein and a standalone acyl carrier protein (ACP) found in the biosynthetic pathways of other tetronates [8, 30]. Mad7 likely catalyses formation of glyceryl-ACP from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate using Mad8 as the ACP scaffold. Mad16 is the FabH-like protein known for catalysing tetronate formation and chain release [18]. Finally, Mad17 and Mad18 are homologues of the acyltransferase Agg4 and the dehydratase Agg5, respectively, responsible for exocyclic double bond formation in agglomerin biosynthesis [31]. Mad17 likely catalyses the acetylation of the C41 hydroxyl, followed by Mad17 catalysing elimination of the acyl group to form the exocyclic C40-C41 double bond (S8 Fig).", "Genes for (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP biosynthesis", "Several polyketide natural products are known to incorporate the unusual methoxymalonate extender unit derived from (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP [32], the first example being the macrocyclic immunosuppressant FK520 [24]. Five genes in the FK520 BGC were identified as responsible for the biosynthesis of (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate [24]. Homologues of these five genes have since been found in the BGCs of other natural products known to incorporate (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP, such as tautomycin [33], oxazolomycin [34], and geldanamycin [35, 36]. The mad gene cluster also contains homologues of these genes: mad11, mad12, mad13, mad14, and mad15, which appear to be part of a single operon. The gene mad14 encodes a second FkbH-like protein, distinct from Mad8, that appears to catalyse formation of a second pool of glyceryl-ACP using 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate and Mad12, another standalone ACP. Whether the two pools of glyceryl-ACP can interchangeably be used in tetronate formation or (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP biosynthesis is unknown. The primary hydroxyl group of glyceryl-ACP undergoes two oxidation events to form (2R)-hydroxymalonyl-ACP. Based on its similarity to the dehydrogenase enzymes in the FK520 pathway, Mad11 is proposed to catalyse the first oxidation, forming 2-hydroxy-3-oxopropionyl-ACP. Mad13 then catalyses the second oxidation to form (2R)-hydroxymalonyl-ACP. The O-methyltransferase Mad15 likely converts (2R)-hydroxymalonyl-ACP into (2R)-methoxymalonyl-ACP (S9 Fig). The exact timing of O-methylation is uncertain, with some evidence suggesting it precedes the oxidation steps [37].", "Tetrahydrofuran ring formation", "The mad gene cluster encodes an epoxidase (MadC) and an epoxide hydrolase (MadB), homologues of which are present in the BGCs of many other tetrahydrofuran-containing polyethers [7, 8, 37\u201339]. In a mechanism first proposed for monensin [40], the epoxidase and epoxide hydrolase catalyse a regio- and stereospecific oxidation cyclisation to form one or multiple rings. It is likely that MadC catalyses the stereospecific epoxidation of the C24-C25 and C28-C29 E double bonds. MadB then catalyses opening of the two epoxide rings to form two tetrahydrofuran rings (S10 Fig). The timing of tetrahydrofuran formation in polyether is not certain, though evidence from other polyether pathways suggests it may occur whilst the intermediate is still bound to the PKS [7, 39, 41].", "Cyclohexane and tetrahydrofuran ring formation", "The gene mad10 is homologous to tsn11 and tmn9 from the tsn and tmn gene clusters, respectively. All three genes encode homologues of PyrE3, the [4+2] cyclase (Diels-Alderase) responsible for catalysing dialkyldecalin formation in the biosynthesis of pyrroindomycin A [42]. The discovery that PyrE3 catalyses an apparent [4+2] cycloaddition was surprising given its homology to MtmOIV-family FAD-dependent monooxygenase. Tsn11, despite also resembling an FAD-dependent monooxygenase, was recently demonstrated to catalyse an apparent inverse-electron demand hetero-Diels-Alder reaction to convert a tetronasin precursor 17 (in which the cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings have not yet formed) (Fig 9C) into an oxadecalin-containing intermediate [7]. We therefore propose that Mad10 catalyses an equivalent reaction in tetromadurin biosynthesis (S11 Fig). In support of this, Mad10, like Tsn11, also contains mutations in several of four conserved arginine residues involved in NADPH utilisation, indicating it is not a functional monooxygenase (S12 Fig) [7, 43, 44]. Further, inspection of a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree revealed that while Tmn9, Mad10, and Tsn11 form a clade together, they are more related to the PyrE3-like [4+2] cyclases [42, 42, 45\u201348] than to their homologues that are bona fide FAD-dependent monooxygenases [43, 49\u201351] (S13 Fig).", "mad31 is a homologue of tsn15 and tmn8, and all are homologs of vstJ, which encodes an enzyme responsible for catalysing spirotetronate formation via an intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition in versipelostatin biosynthesis [46]. Tsn15 was recently demonstrated to catalyse the final step in tetronasin biosynthesis, dismantling the oxadecalin intermediate produced by Tsn11 and forming the tetrahydropyran ring [7]. The crystal structure of Tsn15 has been solved and a tryptophan residue essential for substrate binding identified [7]. Mad31 contains a tryptophan at the equivalent locus, suggesting that tetromadurin biosynthesis also proceeds via an oxadecalin intermediate [7] (S14 Fig).", "Hydroxylation of C36 and C38", "Two cytochrome P450 enzymes are encoded in the mad gene cluster. One of these, Mad29, is homologous to Tsn12 (51% identity) and Tmn14 (32% identity)\u2014the cytochrome P450s encoded by the tsn and tmn gene clusters, respectively [7, 8]. Tmn14 is predicted to catalyse the hydroxylation of C28 in tetronomycin while Tsn12 is predicted to catalyse the hydroxylation of the equivalent carbon (C30) in tetronasin biosynthesis (S15 Fig) [7, 8]. By analogy, Mad29 is therefore proposed to catalyse hydroxylation of C36 in tetromadurin, leaving the second cytochrome P450, Mad30, to catalyse hydroxylation of C38 (S15 Fig). No ferredoxin gene is present in the mad gene cluster, so presumably one encoded elsewhere in the genome is used to regenerate the cytochrome cofactor.", "Other genes in the mad gene cluster", "Finally, the mad gene cluster contains several other genes likely involved in transcriptional regulation or export of tetromadurin itself. On one end of the mad gene cluster the genes mad1 and mad2 encode predicted SARP [52, 53] and LuxR [54] transcriptional regulators, respectively. Another gene, mad27, encodes a putative MarR (multiple antibiotic resistance regulator)-like transcriptional regulator. First described in E. coli, MarR is a transcriptional regulator of several genes that confer antibiotic resistance [55]. Adjacent to mad27 are the genes mad25 and mad26 that encode an ABC transporter and an ABC transporter ATP-binding protein, respectively, both of which are likely involved in exporting tetromadurin from the cytoplasm [56]. Mad27 may induce expression of mad25 and mad26 in the presence of tetromadurin, resulting in self-resistance [57, 58].", "The gene mad3 encodes a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase, required for activating ACP domains by attaching a 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. Adjacent to mad3 is the phosphoesterase mad4, homologues of which are found in BGCs of other polyketides [8, 59], the products of which may hydrolyse ACP-bound 4'-phosphopantetheine groups [59\u201361]. mad6 is predicted to encode type II thioesterase, likely having an \u201cediting\u201d role in hydrolysing PKS active sites containing mis-acylated intermediates [62, 63]. The only gene that could not be assigned a plausible function is mad20, which encodes a hypothetical protein with no characterised homologues.", "Creation of in-frame deletion mutants in mad10 and mad31", "To verify experimentally that the mad gene cluster is indeed responsible for tetromadurin production (as the bioinformatics-based analysis strongly suggested), we performed in-frame deletions in the putative cyclase genes mad10 and mad31. Each gene was individually knocked out in A. verrucosospora using a homologous recombination method, creating A. verrucosospora \u0394mad10 and A. verrucosospora \u0394mad31 respectively (S16 Fig). Tetromadurin production was completely abolished in the A. verrucosospora \u0394mad10 mutant, indicating that, like Tsn11 and its homologue encoded in the tmn gene cluster, Tmn9, Mad10 is an essential biosynthetic enzyme.

However, in trans complementation of mad31 using pIB139 did not rescue tetromadurin production (Fig 7). The failed mad31 complementation, paired with the mad10 complementation only restoring tetromadurin production in A. verrucosospora \u0394mad10 to 28% wild type levels, suggest expression issues of the streptomycete-optimised vector pIB139 within A. verrucosospora.", "The finding that the A. verrucosospora \u0394mad10 no longer produces tetromadurin, as previously shown for the analogous S. sp NRRL \u0394tmn9 and S. longisporoflavus \u0394tsn11 mutants [7, 8], confirms that the PyrE3-like [4+2] cyclase family is essential for the biosynthesis of all three polyether tetronates. Likewise, A. verrucosospora \u0394mad31 and the previously analysed S. longisporoflavus \u0394tsn15 [7] mutant indicate that a conserved VstJ-like cyclase is also essential for polyether tetronate biosynthesis.

The \u2666 indicates an unrelated compound that is also detectable in the WT strain.", "T-17 was produced by A. verrucosospora \u0394mad10 at ca. 50% the level of tetromadurin production by wild type A. verrucosospora. The mass spectra of T-17 contains peaks for putative [M+H]+ (m/z = 745.6), [M+NH4]+ (m/z = 762.6), and [M+Na]+ (m/z = 767.7) ions, all of which are 16 Daltons less than the equivalent ions of tetromadurin (Fig 8C and 8D). A mass difference of 16 is diagnostic of an absent hydroxyl group, indicating that T-17 has the molecular formula C42H64O11. Likely candidates for this missing hydroxyl are either the C36 or the C38 primary hydroxyl group, predicted to be added by the cytochrome P450 enzymes Mad29 and Mad30, respectively. Closer examination of the mass/UV spectra of T-17 revealed striking similarities to the spectra of tetronasin intermediate 17 produced by S. longisporoflavus \u0394tsn11, in which the cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings are unformed [7]. Like 17, the UVmax of T-17 is also 236 nm (Fig 8D) [7]. Furthermore, also as reported for 17, the major ion of T-17 detected is the [M+H\u2212H2O]+ adduct (m/z = 727.7) [7]. In contrast, the major ion detected for tetronasin and tetromadurin in organic extracts of their respective producer strains is the [M+Na]+ adduct (Fig 8). These data indicate that in addition to lacking one of the primary hydroxyl groups added by a cytochrome P450, T-17 also contains a labile hydroxyl group that is readily lost in the mass spectrometer. The likely explanation for this observation is that T-17 is the tetromadurin equivalent of tetronasin intermediate 17, containing a labile hydroxyl group due to the yet-unformed tetrahydropyran and cyclohexane rings (Fig 9). It appears that in the absence of the cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings, one of the cytochrome P450-catalysed hydroxylations, either at C36 (15) or C38 (16), is unable to occur (Fig 9A and 9B).", "10.1371/journal.pone.0239054.g009Fig 9Possible structures of T-17.A. verrucosospora \u0394mad10 no longer produces tetromadurin but produces a tetromadurin derivative, T-17. The mass spectrum of T-17 indicates that it is missing a primary hydroxyl group. The primary hydroxyl groups of tetromadurin are located at C36 and C38. Two possible structures of T-17 are therefore possible where either: a, the C38 hydroxyl group (15) or b, the C36 hydroxyl group (16) is absent. c, the structure of the tetronasin derivative 17 produced by Streptomyces longisporoflavus \u0394tsn11 [7].", "Possible structures of T-17.", "A. verrucosospora \u0394mad10 no longer produces tetromadurin but produces a tetromadurin derivative, T-17.

C36 is the equivalent position to C30 in 17, offering a strong argument in favour of T-17 having the structure 15. The second hydroxylation at C38 must occur after the cyclohexane ring has formed, suggesting it could be the final enzymatic step in tetromadurin biosynthesis (as has been depicted in Fig 5). Alternatively, the hydroxylation may precede tetrahydropyran formation.", "Understanding the substrate tolerance of Mad10 and Mad31 could be important for using them as synthetic biology tools to create novel polyether tetronate antibiotics. In our previous study on tetronasin biosynthesis, we showed that Tmn9 and Tmn8 from the tetronomycin biosynthesis pathway could not substitute for Tsn11 and Tsn15, respectively [7]. Such a result is perhaps unsurprising, given that tetronasin and tetronomycin possess opposite configuration at their cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings. On the other hand, given that the stereochemistry of the cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings in tetromadurin is identical to tetronasin, we reasoned Mad10 and Mad31 would have a greater chance of successfully substituting for the equivalent tsn enzymes. To test this, mad10 was expressed in trans in the S. longisporoflavus \u0394tsn11 mutant and mad31 was expressed in trans in the S. longisporoflavus \u0394tsn15 mutant. However, HPLC analysis of these S. longisporoflavus mutants revealed that tetronasin production was not rescued in either case (S19 Fig), indicating that Mad10 and Mad31 are unable to accept the tetronasin intermediates."]
