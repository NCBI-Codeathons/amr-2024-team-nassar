["3. Results", "3.1. Effect of Surfactin Treatment on Bacterial Cell Growth", "While it is already known that Gram-positive bacteria show a higher sensitivity to biopharmaceuticals than Gram-negative bacteria, it is imperative to determine an overall effect of surfactin as an antimicrobial biosurfactant against a variety of microbes. Accordingly, model organisms or well-established representatives used in both fundamental research and biotechnological applications were employed for initial stress approaches with high surfactin amounts (Table 1). For more insights into the surfactin used in the stress approaches, mass spectrometric analyses were carried out. More specifically, the most abundant surfactin version exhibited the well-known peptide structure E-L-L-V-D-L-L. In this context, the highly active surfactin C isoform comprised about 28%. A more detailed overview of the quantitative mass spectrometric analyses of the surfactin isoforms is provided in the Supplementary Data. To test the effect of surfactin solutions on both types of bacteria, the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium glutamicum and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida were used.", "To ensure relatively comparable bacterial growth without limitations, the cultivations were carried out in LB medium. After reaching an optical density of about 1, surfactin solution dissolved in distilled water was added to the respective cell suspensions (Figure 1, please see Supplementary Material). After surfactin treatment, a relatively small but detectable reduction in growth rate was measured for B. subtilis and E. coli, while no effect was observed for C. glutamicum and a slightly stimulatory effect for P. putida. In detail, untreated B. subtilis cultures reached an OD600 of 5.2, while the addition of 50 and 100 g/L surfactin reduced the final OD600 to 4.5 and 4.3, respectively, corresponding to a biomass reduction of 13 to 17%. For the other Gram-positive bacterium, C. glutamicum, no effects on cell growth were observed, resulting in OD600 values of 2.83 (50 g/L surfactin) and 2.63 (100 g/L surfactin) compared to an unaffected OD600 of 2.77. Comparable to B. subtilis, E. coli cultures showed a reduction in OD600 values of about 9 and 22% after addition of 50 and 100 g/L surfactin, respectively. In contrast, absolutely no negative effect was observed for P. putida cell growth, resulting in slightly increased optical densities of about 20% for 50 and 100 g/L surfactin.", "In summary, only for B. subtilis and E. coli a slight reduction in cell growth was observed after addition of high amounts of surfactin, while absolutely no effect (C. glutamicum) or even a stimulating effect (P. putida) was observed. Since relatively high surfactin concentrations were used for the stress approaches, surfactin appears to have only low antimicrobial properties.", "3.2. Comparative Analyses of Microbial Sensitivity to Rhamnolipids and Sophorolipids", "While the surfactin stress approaches showed that the addition of high amounts of surfactin led to a slight reduction in cell growth for some strains, the surfactin concentrations used were not comparable to minimal inhibitory concentrations of other bioactive metabolites described for their antimicrobial properties. For validation, rhamnolipids and sophorolipids were used in comparable stress approaches as previously described for surfactin (Figure 2, please see Supplementary Material).", "Compared to surfactin, a broad spectrum of microbial tolerances and sensitivities was determined through the stress approaches with rhamnolipids and sophorolipids as further exemplary bioactive metabolites. Specifically, rhamnolipids at a final concentration of 50 mg/L show a bactericidal effect for B. subtilis, while a concentration of 20 mg/L also showed an effect on B. subtilis cell growth (Figure 2A). No cell lysis was observed for the other Gram-positive representative, C. glutamicum. While rhamnolipid concentrations of 50 mg/L showed absolutely no effect, 100 mg/L rhamnolipids reduced cell growth for the next 4 h of cultivation before a comparable optical density was reached (Figure 2B).", "With respect to E. coli and P. putida, heterologous production of rhamnolipids by genetically modified strains has been demonstrated in several studies [59,60]. However, in E. coli, both rhamnolipid treatments at 20 and 50 g/L resulted in a bacteriostatic effect. More specifically, significantly reduced cell growth was observed after addition of 20 g/L, resulting in comparable maximum optical densities relative to untreated cultures after a delay of 3 h. In contrast, no further cell growth was detected in E. coli treated with 50 g/L rhamnolipids. In P. putida, no change in cell growth was observed after treatment with 20 g/L rhamnolipids, while a bacteriostatic effect and a reduction in cell growth of about 61% was detected with 50 g/L.", "In studies with sophorolipids, a clear difference in tolerance was observed between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, no effects were observed for E. coli and P. putida at sophorolipid concentrations of up to 1 g/L. In comparison, cell growth of B. subtilis was affected at both 100 mg/L and 200 mg/L of sophorolipids, resulting in cell lysis within the next 1 h. In C. glutamicum, treatment of 100 mg/L and 200 mg/L sophorolipids induced an arrest of cell growth, followed by a slight decrease in optical density over time. Overall, although both Gram-positive microorganisms displayed impaired cell growth, C. glutamicum appears to use different defence strategies against antimicrobial biosurfactants compared to B. subtilis.", "Regarding B. subtilis, which seems to be the most sensitive bacterial strain in this comparative study, it appeared particularly clear that a multiple less of the substance amount of rhamnolipid (50 mg/L) and sophorolipid (100 mg/L) was required not only to reduce cell growth but also to induce cell lysis, as demonstrated by a noticeable reduction in optical density. In comparison, only a reduction of B. subtilis cell growth of about 17% was measured after addition of 100 g/L surfactin. To simulate this growth-reducing effect of accumulating surfactin during B. subtilis bioprocesses, a mineral salt medium used in bioreactor fermentrations for surfactin production [6] was applied to reproduce the effect on B. subtilis growth in combination with pre-existing surfactin concentrations.", "3.3. Effect of Surfactin Present during the Cultivation Process of B. subtilis", "In several studies, the production of surfactin was carried out in defined mineral salt medium [6,40,42]. To simulate the effect of surfactin accumulated during B. subtilis cultivation, increasing amounts of surfactin were added to main cultures with B. subtilis KM0 using 8 g/L of glucose (Figure 3, please see Supplementary Material). In the reference process, a maximum OD600 of 6.8 and a growth rate \u00b5 of 0.454 were achieved during the exponential phase of cultivation before glucose was depleted and the OD600 decreased [61]. After an extended lag phase, a similar maximum OD600 value was observed during cultivation with 10 g/L surfactin, resulting in an OD600 of 5.6, although the growth rate \u00b5 was drastically reduced during the exponential growth phase (\u00b5 = 0.186; reduction of 59%). A subsequent increase in surfactin concentration led to a substantial decrease in B. subtilis cell growth. Accordingly, the presence of 30, 50 and 70 g/L surfactin reduced the maximum OD600 values to 3.7, 2.4 and 1.5 and the growth rates \u00b5 during the corresponding exponential phase to 0.166, 0.157 and 0.149, respectively.", "3.4. Proteomic Alterations of Unadapted B. subtilis Cells after Surfactin Treatment", "Since bacterial adaptation mechanisms are induced immediately after stress induction, adaptation of the B. subtilis proteome to high surfactin amounts was detected with non-adapted B. subtilis KM0 cells, which are not capable of surfactin production. For this purpose, the mineral salt medium commonly used for B. subtilis-mediated surfactin production was applied. For the investigations of protein-based stress adaptation to high amounts of surfactin, as should also occur in bioreactor fermentations if possible, 75 g/L surfactin was used.", "While the reference process without surfactin treatment showed growth rates of approximately 0.37, a reduction about 38% was observed after addition of 75 g/L surfactin, resulting in growth rates of 0.23 (Figure 4A). To gain insight into the initial proteome adaptations, samples were taken immediately before and 10 min after surfactin treatment. Changes in the proteome were measured by NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS experiments and visualised by Volcano plots and Vonoroi treemaps (Figure 4B,C).", "Overall, 38.5% of the theoretical proteome could be identified, with 3.5% (57 proteins; Figure 4B, red) significantly increased and 2.0% (33 proteins; Figure 4B, blue) reduced in abundance after addition of surfactin compared to the reference cultivation. Classification using information from the SubtiWiki database [55] in a coloured Voronoi treemap showed that a large number of 66 proteins could be assigned to the category \u201ccoping with stress\u201d. Other classifications with relatively high proportions of proteins with altered abundances were \u201ccell envelope and cell differentiation\u201d (19 proteins) and \u201cprotein synthesis, modification and degradation\u201d (11 proteins) (Figure 4C).", "Specifically, genes encoding a notable proportion of the proteins significantly induced after surfactin treatment were described as targets of the alternative sigma factors \u03c3B and \u03c3W. Overall, according to the SubtiWiki database [55], about 52% of all significantly induced proteins were part of the \u03c3B regulon and about 19% were regulated by \u03c3W. In this context, the results also showed the induction of redox-sensitive modulators of the general stress response, Spx and MgsR, indicating the presence of intracellular oxidative stress [62,63]. Consequently, proteins associated with sub-regulatory networks, such as YsnF, YdbD, YdaD, YdaG, YhxD and YhdF, which are only detectable after redox-sensitive MgsR activation, could be measured as significantly induced (Table 2) [64].", "In addition to the relevance of alternative sigma factors, the identification of LiaH as the most strongly induced protein revealed the activation of the two-component system LiaRS. Previous studies have shown that LiaRS is part of the stress response to antibiotics that are active on the cell wall (e.g., bacitracin, nisin, ramoplanin, vancomycin and daptomycin), but also to bioactive biosurfactants, such as rhamnolipids [30,65,66].", "Another aspect noted after surfactin treatment was an increased formation of enzymes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis (TrpA, TrpB and TrpE). Comparable observations were previously described in heat shock experiments with B. licheniformis [67], suggesting that the increased tryptophan biosynthesis is part of a general bacterial stress response.", "In contrast, most of the proteins classified in \u201ccell envelope and cell division\u201d (52% of all significantly reduced proteins) showed a reduction in their abundances after treatment with surfactin, indicating a general decrease in bacterial metabolism and thus cellular reproductive capacity. In particular, lower abundances were found for the autolysins LytC, LytE and LytF. These hydrolytically active enzymes are important for cell wall turnover and consequently for cell elongation and cell separation [68]. The reduced protein level of autolysins is consistent with the reduced growth rates calculated after addition of increasing surfactin concentrations (Figure 3 and Figure 4).", "Table 2 gives an overview of the significantly changed protein abundances with differences \u00b1 1.5."]
