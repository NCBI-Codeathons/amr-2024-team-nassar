["Results", "Identification of a fungal parasite on the rocaglate-producing plant Aglaia", "Considering that Aglaia plants possess antifungal rocaglates (Engelmeier et al., 2000; Iyer et al., 2020), parasitic fungi should have difficulty infecting rocaglate-producing plants. In contrast to this idea, we identified a fungus growing on the surface of the stem of the Aglaia odorata plant with tremendous vitality (Figure 1A). To characterize this fungus, we isolated the RNA, conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), reconstructed the transcriptome, and annotated the functionality of each gene (Supplementary file 1).", "Figure 1.Identification of Aglaia-parasitic Ophiocordyceps sp.

Ophiocordyceps spp. are members of the phylum Ascomycota and constitute the taxonomic groups with the highest number of entomopathogenic species among all fungal genera. In most cases, each Ophiocordyceps spp. has a specific host insect species, develops fruiting bodies from the remains of host insects, and produces spores. In addition to insect infection, a moth parasite, Ophiocordyceps sinensis, has been found to reside on many plant species, suggesting that Ophiocordyceps also has an endophytic lifestyle (Wang et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2014). We performed a BLASTn search (Camacho et al., 2009) using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) between rRNAs as a query and found that, among all the deposited nucleotide sequences in the database, 29 of the top 30 hits were from Ophiocordyceps species (Supplementary file 2).", "To identify the species-level taxon of the Aglaia-infecting fungus, we conducted a multilocus phylogenetic analysis for comparison with currently accepted species in the Ophiocordyceps genus (Supplementary file 3). For this purpose, sequences of the ITS, small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU), large subunit rRNA (LSU), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1\u03b1), and RNA polymerase II largest subunit (RPB1) were used as previously reported for the classification of Ophiocordyceps species (Xiao et al., 2017; Supplementary file 3). These sequences from 68 isolates were aligned, trimmed, and concatenated, resulting in a multiple sequence alignment comprising 3910 nucleotide positions, including gaps (gene boundaries ITS, 1\u2013463; LSU, 464\u20131363; SSU, 1364\u20132248; RPB1, 2249\u20132922; TEF1\u03b1, 2923\u20133910). Then, the best-scoring maximum likelihood (ML) tree was generated from the concatenated sequence alignment using the selected DNA substitution models for each sequence (Figure 1B). This analysis indicated that the Aglaia-infecting fungus was distinct from the other species of Ophiocordyceps (Figure 1B). In particular, the strain isolated from Aglaia was positioned on a long branch separated from the most closely related strain, O. coccidiicola NBRC 100682, as supported by the 95% bootstrap value. The separation of Aglaia-infecting fungus from other Ophiocordyceps species was also confirmed by single-locus alignments (Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20135), although the positions of the Aglaia-infecting fungus in the tree were different. We note that RPB1-locus alignment was an exception since the de novo-assembled transcriptome from the Aglaia-infecting fungus lacked the sequence of the homolog.", "Given that the most closely related Ophiocordyceps species is sufficiently distinct from the Aglaia-infecting fungus in sequence and that no similar fungi grown in Aglaia plants were reported before, we named the fungus Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 (Berkeley, Ryan Muller, strain 1). Consistent with its isolation from the Aglaia plant, this fungus was closely related to known endophytic Ophiocordyceps spp. (Figure 1B and Supplementary file 3; Wang et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2014).", "Transcriptome assembly uncovers the unique mutation in eIF4A of the Aglaia-infecting fungus", "The parasitic nature of Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 on plants producing the antifungal rocaglate led us to hypothesize that the fungus may have a mechanism to evade the toxicity of the compounds. Indeed, the host plant Aglaia achieves this task by introducing an amino acid substitution in eIF4A, a target of rocaglates (Iwasaki et al., 2019). The substituted amino acid (Phe163, amino acid position in human eIF4A1) lies at the critical interface for rocaglate interaction (Figure 2A and D; Iwasaki et al., 2019). Accordingly, we investigated possible amino acid conversions in eIF4As of the Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1. Among the de novo-assembled transcriptome, ~60 DEAD-box RNA binding protein genes, including 4 transcript isoforms of eIF4A, were found (Supplementary file 1).", "Figure 2.The effect of an amino acid substitution found in Ophiocordyceps sp.

Unlike ADP + Pi, the nonhydrolyzable analog AMP-PNP allowed basal binding to polypurine RNAs in the absence of RocA. The affinity was further increased by RocA in eIF4A with a Phe or His residues at 163 (human position). In contrast, the proteins with the Gly residue showed the relatively small affinity changes (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3I and Table 1).", "Taking these biochemical data together, we concluded that the Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A evades rocaglate targeting by substituting a critical amino acid involved in its binding. When Phe163 was replaced by Gly in the crystal structure of the human eIF4A1\u2022RocA complex (Iwasaki et al., 2019), the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking with ring C of RocA was totally lost (Figure 2D and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C), likely leading to reduced affinity for RocA. This mechanism to desensitize eIF4A to rocaglates was distinct from the Leu substitution found in Aglaia, which fills the space of the rocaglate binding pocket and thus prevents the interaction (Iwasaki et al., 2019).", "Our data showed that eIF4A with His at position 163 (human position) is also a target of rocaglate (Figure 2C, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3, and Table 1). This is most likely due to the functional replacement of the aromatic ring in Phe by the imidazole ring in His for stacking with ring C of rocaglates (Figure 2D). Although compared to the Phe substitution, the His substitution in human and Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4As was accompanied by an attenuated potency of RocA (Figure 2C, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3, and Table 1), our data suggested that a wide array of fungi that possess the His variant (Figure 2A), including C. orbiculare (see below for details), are also susceptible to rocaglates.", "Gly153 found in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A confers resistance to rocaglate-induced translational repression", "The reduced affinity to polypurine RNA gained in the Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A by Gly substitution led us to investigate the impact on rocaglate-mediated translational repression. To test this, we applied a reconstituted translation system with human factors (Iwasaki et al., 2019; Machida et al., 2018; Yokoyama et al., 2019). As observed in an earlier study (Iwasaki et al., 2019), this system enabled the recapitulation of translation reduction from polypurine motif-possessing reporter mRNA but not from mRNA with control CAA repeats in a RocA dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). In contrast, replacing wild-type human eIF4A1 with the Phe163Gly mutant prevented the translation repression mediated by RocA (Figure 3A), consistent with the affinity between the recombinant human eIF4A1 proteins and polypurine RNA (Figure 2C, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3, and Table 1).", "Figure 3.The amino acid substitution in the Ophiocordyceps sp.

The p values in (C\u2013F) were calculated by the Mann\u2013Whitney U test.", "Given that rocaglate-mediated translational repression is driven by a gain of function (Chen et al., 2021; Iwasaki et al., 2016; Iwasaki et al., 2019), Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A should not have this mode. To investigate this possibility, we used a preformed RocA-eIF4A-mRNA complex for the translation reaction (Iwasaki et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2016). We first preincubated recombinant Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A or the corresponding Gly172His mutant protein with a reporter mRNA possessing polypurine motifs in the presence or absence of RocA. If RocA could target the eIF4A protein, eIF4A should be stably clamped on the polypurine tract, providing steric hindrance to scanning ribosomes and thus repressing protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Whereas WT Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A could not alter translation (Figure 3B, left) due to its weaker ability to clamp on polypurine RNAs, the Gly172His mutant could act as a translation repressor (Figure 3B, right). These data indicated that Gly172His in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A restores the gain-of-function mechanism of RocA.", "We further tested the impact of the Gly conversion in eIF4A in a fungus. Due to the difficulty of culturing and manipulating the genetics of Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 (data not shown), we instead harnessed C. orbiculare, an anthracnose-causing fungus (Gan et al., 2019; Gan et al., 2013). Through homology-directed repair induced by CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated genome cleavage, we replaced endogenous eIF4A with wild-type (WT) or Gly-mutated (His153Gly) C. orbiculare eIF4A (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A and B). Notably, we did not find any significant growth defects resulting from these genetic manipulations (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C and D).", "Since the culture of the isolated strains requires a significant amount of the compounds, we used aglafoline (methyl rocaglate) (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C), a less expensive, commercially available natural derivative of rocaglates (Ko et al., 1992), instead of RocA. The difference between RocA and aglafoline is the dimethylamide group versus the methoxycarbonyl group (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C), which do not contribute to the association with eIF4A or polypurine RNA (Iwasaki et al., 2019), suggesting that the compounds should have similar mechanisms of action. As expected, aglafoline resulted in essentially the same molecular phenotype of ATP-independent polypurine clamping of the Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H and Table 1) as RocA (Figure 2C, right, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2F\u2013H; and Table 1).", "To understand the translational repression induced by aglafoline in a genome-wide manner, we applied ribosome profiling, a technique based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected RNA fragments (i.e., ribosome footprints) generated by RNase treatment (Ingolia et al., 2019; Ingolia et al., 2009; Iwasaki and Ingolia, 2017), to the isolated fungus strains. The ribosome footprints obtained from C. orbiculare (in the culture of conidia and mycelia) showed the signatures of this experiment: two peaks of footprint length at ~22 nt and ~30 nt (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A), which respectively represent the absence or presence of A-site tRNA in the ribosome (Lareau et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2019), and 3-nt periodicity along the open reading frame (ORF) (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B and C). By normalizing the footprint reads by the RNA abundance as measured by RNA-Seq, we calculated the translation efficiency and quantified its change induced by aglafoline treatment.", "Strikingly, this genome-wide approach revealed that His153Gly confers translational resistance to aglafoline on C. orbiculare. Consistent with the mRNA-selective action of the compound, we observed that a subset of mRNAs showed high aglafoline sensitivity in terms of translation efficiency in conidia (Figure 3C) and that the reduction was compound dose dependent (Figure 3D). Intriguingly, we observed that genes associated with the ribosome and its assembly were susceptible to rocaglate-mediated translational repression (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A). The reduction in translation efficiency mediated by aglafoline was attenuated by the His153Gly substitution (Figure 3E). This conclusion was also supported by global translation assessment (Figure 3F), which is based on cytosolic ribosome footprint alterations normalized to the mitochondrial footprints as internal spike-ins (Iwasaki et al., 2016). Consistent with earlier reports (Chen et al., 2021; Chu et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2016; Iwasaki et al., 2019), the reduction in translation efficiency was associated with the presence of polypurine motifs in the 5\u2032 UTR (Figure 3G). However, the His153Gly substitution compromised the polypurine-dependent translational repression. Although the mycelial stage of the fungus showed the similar trends in translational repression mediated by aglafoline (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013F), the sensitive mRNAs were distinct from those in conidia (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3G), suggesting differential impacts of rocaglates during the fungal life cycle.", "Rocaglate-resistant fungi show an advantage in infection of plants with rocaglates", "We were intrigued to test the role of Gly substitution in the parasitic property of fungi. Here, we used the infection process of C. orbiculare on cucumber leaves as a model system. The conidia of WT or His153Gly eIF4A-recombined strains were sprayed on Cucumis sativus (cucumber) cotyledons, and the biomass after inoculation with rocaglate was quantified (Figure 4A). Indeed, aglafoline reduced the biomass of the WT eIF4A-recombined strain on cucumber leaves, showing the antifungal effect of rocaglate (Figure 4B). In stark contrast, the His153Gly mutation in eIF4A affected fungal growth on cucumber leaves and resulted in rocaglate resistance in the fungi (Figure 4B). We note that the differential biomass of C. orbiculare could not be explained by the damage to cucumber leaves by aglafoline treatment as no morphological alteration of the leaves was observed under our conditions (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A). These results demonstrated that the Gly substitution found in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A provides the molecular basis of antirocaglate properties and allows the growth of the parasitic fungus in the presence of rocaglate (Figure 5).", "Figure 4.Phenotypic comparison of the C. orbiculare eIF4AWT and eIF4AHis153Gly strains during infection in the presence of rocaglate.(A) Workflow for monitoring the biomass of C. orbiculare eIF4AWT or eIF4AHis153Gly strains on cucumber leaves under treatment with aglafoline.
