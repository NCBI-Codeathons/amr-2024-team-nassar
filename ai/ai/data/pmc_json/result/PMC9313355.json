["3. Results", "3.1. BCP Alleviated OGD/R Injury-Induced Decreases of Cell Viability and Apoptosis", "To examine the exact role of BCP on OGD/R injury, we first determined biologically safe doses of BCP for HT-22 cells under normoxic conditions using an MTT assay. The results showed that BCP concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 mM exerted no significant toxic effects on cell viability under normoxic conditions (Figure 1A). Subsequently, OGD/R-treated HT-22 cells were exposed to biologically safe concentrations of BCP (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 50 mM). We found that BCP obviously rescued cell viability following OGD/R injury in a dose-dependent manner, especially 10 mM BCP, which could significantly improve the decrease in cell viability caused by OGD/R injury relative to the control group (Figure 1B). Furthermore, the number and morphology of HT-22 cells after treatment with BCP at 5, 10, and 20 mM revealed alleviation of the effects of OGD/R injury (Figure 1C). In addition, apoptosis was reduced by treatment with BCP in a dose-dependent manner after OGD/R injury (Figure 1D,E). Collectively, these results indicate that BCP protected HT-22 cells against OGD/R injury.", "3.2. Identification of Mitophagy Regulators by Metascape Online Analysis", "Since activating mitophagy seems to be critical for neuronal survival following CIR injury, we selected 36 mitophagy regulators gene (Table S1) from published papers to analyze their possible biological processes by Metascape online analysis (https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1 (accessed on 22 April 2022). GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed these mitophagy regulators interrelated to biological processes such as pathways of neurogeneration, regulation of apoptotic process and growth which are closely connected with CIR-mediated neuroinjury (Figure 2A\u2013D). Additionally, these essential mitophagy regulators interacted with multiple genes in PPI network (Figure 2E,F). We can found from Figure 2F that the PINK1-PARK pathway is close to the process of mitophagy. TOMMs and VDACs are the representative molecule of mitochondrion.BECN1, SQSTM1, ATG5, ATG12 and ULK1 are the representative molecule of autophagy. Therefore, we supposed that mitophagy may be the mechanism for BCP-mediated protection against CIR injury.", "3.3. BCP Enhanced Mitophagy in OGD/R-Injured HT-22 Cells", "To address the role of BCP in regulating mitophagy of OGD/R cells, the level of mitophagy was detected. First, we found that the OGD/R cells exhibited moderate decreases in protein expression of mitochondrial markers TOM20 and p62, and a moderate increase about the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio compared with the control cells. Notably, BCP treatment prominently decreased the expression of TOM20 and p62, and remarkably increased the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio compared with the OGD/R cells (Figure 3A\u2013D). Furthermore, accumulation of autophagosomes was observed in OGD/R cells compared with the control cells. However, numbers of autophagosomes in cells treated with BCP were significantly increased, and autophagic vacuoles wrapping around damaged mitochondria and organelles could be seen that were absent in the OGD/R cells (Figure 3E,F). In addition, double-immunofluorescence staining of LC3 and the VDAC1 (a mitochondrial marker) was investigate to colocalization of mitophagy. We observed less fluorescence of LC3 in the control group. After the OGD/R operation, increased LC3 expression suggested a higher level of autophagy. Moreover, the expression of LC3B/VDAC1 were higher in the OGD/R cells compared with the control cells, suggesting that mitophagy was activated. Significantly higher expression of LC3B/VDAC1 were observed in the BCP treatment cells compared with the OGD/R cells (Figure 3G,H). Quantitative analysis also suggested increased the expression of LC3B/VDAC1 in the BCP treatment cells compared with the other cells. Finally, qRT-PCR revealed a moderate decrease of mtDNA copy numbers in the OGD/R cells compared with the control cells, and mtDNA copy numbers were sharply diminished in the BCP treatment cells compared with the OGD/R cells (Figure 3I). These results illustrated that BCP pre-treatment was important for facilitating mitophagy to clear damaged mitochondria in OGD/R cells.", "3.4. BCP Activates the Pink1/Parkin2 Pathway in OGD/R-Injured HT-22 Cells", "To examine the mechanism by which BCP mediated mitophagy in OGD/R cells, effects of BCP on the Pink1/Parkin2 pathway were observed. Our results show that the OGD/R group exhibited moderate increases in Pink1 and Parkin2 protein expression levels compared with the control group, while BCP treatment significantly increased Pink1 and Parkin2 protein expression levels compared with OGD/R and control groups (Figure 4A\u2013C).", "Parkin2 is recruited to mitochondria, where is remains localized during mitophagy. Double-immunofluorescence staining results shown that Parkin2 was expressed at low levels during mitochondrial translocation in the control group, while moderate increases the expression of Parkin2/VDAC1 were observed in the OGD/R cells. Additionally, significant increases the expression of Parkin2/VDAC1 were observed in the BCP-treated OGD/R cells (Figure 4D,E). These results implicated that the Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway is activated in OGD/R cells.", "3.5. Facilitating Mitophagy via the Pink1/Parkin2 Pathway Plays an Important Role in BCP Protection against OGD/R Injury of HT-22 Cells", "To clarify the involvement of activated mitophagy in BCP-mediated protection against OGD/R injury of HT-22 cells, mitophagy was blocked with the mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1. MTT assay results showed that BCP treatment markedly promoted the growth and survival of OGD/R cells, whereas Mdivi-1 obviously blocked BCP-induced growth and survival of OGD/R cells (Figure 5A). Moreover, BCP treatment alleviated the number and morphology of OGD/R cells, whereas Mdivi-1 blocked the protective role of BCP against these changes in OGD/R cells (Figure 5B). Furthermore, BCP treatment reduced apoptosis of OGD/R cells, a feature that was also blocked by Mdivi-1 (Figure 5C,D).", "Additionally, we evaluated mitophagy levels after exposure to Mdivi-1. We found that Mdivi-1 reversed the BCP-mediated decreases in expression of TOM20 and p62, and increase in the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio in OGD/R cells (Figure 6A\u2013D). Consistently, Mdivi-1 blocked the BCP-induced increase of autophagic vacuoles wrapping around damaged mitochondria in OGD/R cells (Figure 6E,F). Furthermore, Mdivi-1 blocked the significant BCP-induced increase of Parkin2/VDAC1-positive cells following OGD/R injury (Figure 6G,H). In addition, Mdivi-1 reversed the BCP-mediated decrease in mtDNA copy numbers in OGD/R cells (Figure 6I). Finally, Mdivi-1 reversed BCP-mediated increases in Pink1 and Parkin2 protein expression levels in OGD/R cells (Figure 7A\u2013C). In accordance with mitochondrial translocation assay results, Mdivi-1 blocked BCP-mediated increases of Parkin2/VDAC1-positive cells (Figure 7D,E). Therefore, BCP mediated protection against OGD/R-mediated injury in HT-22 cells mainly by facilitating mitophagy via the Pink1/Parkin2 pathway.", "3.6. BCP Protected against Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Facilitating Mitophagy in C57BL/6 Mice", "To determine whether BCP contributes to protection against CIR in a manner dependent on mitophagy in vivo, as shown in Figure 8A, C57BL/6 mice were divided into groups treated with 36 mg/kg, 72 mg/kg, or 144 mg/kg BCP (low-, middle-, and high-dose groups) before undergoing a transient MCAO procedure. Mdivi-1 was injected intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion (3 mg/kg). Mice were sacrificed 24 h after reperfusion. Severe neurological deficits were present in the MCAO/R group compared with sham and BCP-treated sham groups, and BCP treatment reduced neurological scores in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 8B). MCAO/R group mice exhibited reduced times in rotarod testing compared with respective sham and BCP-treated sham groups. Treatment with BCP increased times spent on the rotarod after MCAO/R in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 8C), especially 72 mg/kg BCP, which prominently protected against MCAO/R-mediated nerve injury. However, Mdivi-1 abolished these neuroprotective effects, as indicated by increased neurologic scores and reduced times on the rotarod (Figure 8B,C). Infarct volumes were assessed by TTC. Compared with outcomes in the MCAO/R group, BCP treatment markedly decreased infarct volumes in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that BCP improved functional outcomes after MCAO/R injury (Figure 8D,E). In addition, H&E stained sections were analyzed the necrotic cells in the hippocampal CA1 region. As shown in Figure 8F, neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region were arranged in nomal rows, shown intact cell structures, and had clear nuclear outlines in sham and BCP-treated sham groups (black arrows). After 24 h of reperfusion, neurons were necrotic and shrank, cellular edema, and nuclear condensation (red arrows). However, BCP significantly prevented neuron damage and improved the pathology associated with MCAO/R in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, Mdivi-1 blocked this neuroprotection in MCAO/R mice, as indicated by increased infarct volumes and CA1 neuronal injury (Figure 8D\u2013F). These results suggest that BCP protected against MCAO/R injury in vivo in an autophagy-dependent manner.", "3.7. BCP Facilitated Mitophagy after Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in C57BL/6 Mice", "Western blot results showed moderate decreases in protein expression of mitochondria markers TOM20 and p62, as well a moderate increase in the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio in the MCAO/R group compared with the sham group. Compared with the MCAO/R group, BCP pretreatment significantly increased the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio and TOM20 expression, and decreased p62 expression. However, changes in expression of these proteins were reversed by treatment with a mitophagy inhibitor (Mdivi-1) (Figure 9A\u2013D). In addition, electron microscopy results showed that healthy mitochondria were present in the sham group. Neurons in the MCAO/R group displayed mitochondrial swelling, loss of matrix density, autophagic vacuoles, partially degraded mitochondria, small numbers of autophagic vacuoles, and double-membraned autophagosomes containing damaged mitochondria. In contrast, mitochondria with some slight swelling and nearly normal matrix densities were observed in the BCP group. Additionally, typical autophagosomes were frequently observed in the BCP group, and were more abundant compared with the MCAO/R group. In contrast, only a small number of autophagosomes were found in the BCP + Mdivi-1 group and no typical autophagosomes were observed in the Mdivi-1 group (Figure 9E,F).", "We further detected expression of the mitochondrial membrane protein VDAC1 and LC3 by immunofluorescence co-staining. As reflected in Figure 9G,H, there was little increase in LC3/VDAC1-positive cells in the control group, while BCP pretreatment significantly increased the percentage of LC3/VDAC1-positive cells compared with the MCAO/R group. In contrast, the percentage of LC3/VDAC1-positive cells was clearly decreased in the BCP + Mdivi-1 group. Finally, we examined relative amounts of mitochondria in different groups by qPCR. mt-Atp6/Rpl13 ratios were significantly decreased in the BCP group compared with the MCAO/R group, confirming that the loss of mitochondria was due to autophagy. Employment of the mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 significantly increased the mt-Atp6/Rpl13 ratio (Figure 9I). Collectively, these results revealed that BCP can clear MCAO/R-induced damaged mitochondria by accelerating mitophagy.", "3.8. Pink1/Parkin2 Pathway-Dependent Mitophagy Is Implicated in BCP-Induced Protection against CIR Injury", "We detected expression of Pink1 and Parkin2 proteins by Western blot. The results suggested an increase in Pink1 and Parkin2 protein expression levels in the MCAO/R group compared with the sham group. The BCP treatment group exhibited significantly upregulated expression of Pink1 and Parkin2 compared with the MCAO/R group (Figure 10A\u2013C). However, administration of Mdivi-1 inhibited BCP-induced upregulation of Pink1 and Parkin2 expression levels. In addition, we examined the recruitment of Parkin2 to mitochondria. Parkin2 and VDAC1 localization were detected by immunofluorescence staining in ischemic hippocampi of MCAO/R mice. We found that translocation of Parkin2 to mitochondria was increased in the BCP group compared with the MCAO/R group (significant increase of Parkin2/VDAC1-positive cells). In the BCP + Mdivi-1 group, translocation of Parkin2 to mitochondria was decreased compared with findings from the BCP group (Figure 10D,E). Therefore, these results indicated that the Pink1/Parkin2 signaling pathway is required for BCP-induced mitophagy activation in BCP-induced protection against CIR injury."]
