["Results", "Changes of Conventional Composting Indicators", "The key indicators of composting are temperature, pH, moisture, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and C/N. The results are shown in Figure 1. Swine manure aerobic composting was performed for 32 days. The maximum temperature in AB was 62.1\u00b0C, the maximum temperature in CK was 60.9\u00b0C, and the temperatures of the two groups both lasted more than 3 days above 55\u00b0C (Figure 1A). It reached the standard of harmless treatment of reactor compost. The moisture content continued to decline during composting and that of the AB group dropped faster than the CK group (Figure 1B). This is because the microbial activity in the AB group compost was stronger, the temperature during the thermophilic phase was higher, and the high temperature lasted longer, so the water loss rate was more rapid. The pH increased gradually in the early stage of composting and declined slowly and stabilized (Figure 1C). In the early stage of composting, the ammonification was strong, the pH value rose rapidly, and the nitrification increased in the maturation phase; then, the pH value began to decrease, and the final pH value was stable between 8 and 9. The TC content in composting process showed a downward trend (Figure 1D). The carbon content of the AB group declined rapidly during the thermophilic phase, which may indicate strong microbial activity in the early stage of composting and converting the organic matter into carbon dioxide or minerals. The change in TN content of the composting piles first decreased and then increased (Figure 1E). The content of TN in the AB group was higher than that in the CK group in the maturation phase, which may be attributable to compound microbial inoculants playing a role in nitrogen preservation. The initial carbon and nitrogen ratio of the material was \u205320. At the end of composting, the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the AB group was 13.15 and that of the CK group was 15.08 (Figure 1F). Both compost groups reached a mature state. The above results show that adding compound microbial inoculants can increase the maximum temperature of compost, prolong the high-temperature period, and accelerate water loss and nitrogen fixation during swine manure composting. The addition of compound microbial inoculants can accelerate and strengthen the composting process and improve the fertilizer efficiency of composting products.", "Figure 1Physicochemical changes during swine manure composting.

ARGs showed the same trend in the two groups (Figures 2, 3). The abundances of ARGs ranged from 3.6 \u00d7 103 to 1.13 \u00d7 108 copies/g. The ARGs with the highest abundance was sul2, and the lowest was blaCTX. For nine tetracycline resistance genes, the abundance of tetW gene is the highest, and the tetG abundance is the lowest (Figure 2). As the compost goes on, the reservoir of 11 ARGs (tetH, tetL, tetM, tetO, tetQ, tetW, ermB, ermQ, blaCTX, blaTEM, and tn916) are reduced at the end of composting. The total removal rates are 22.8\u201399.7%. tetM, tetO, tetQ, ermB, ermQ, and blaTEM were significantly reduced at the end of the thermophilic phase on the 5th day. At the end of composting, the reduction effect of ARGs (tetH, tetL, tetM, blaCTX, and tn916) in the AB group was significantly higher than that in the CK group. Compound microbial inoculants increased these ARGs removal in swine manure with increasing rates of 3.7\u201323.8%. At the same time, we also studied the spatial distribution and variation characteristics of ARGs during composting. We found that the contents of ARGs at different layers of the composting piles were significantly different. The abundance of ARGs in the middle and lower layers of compost showed the same trend. Overall, the reduction effect of ARGs was as follows: middle layer > upper layer > lower layer. On the other hand, we found that tetA, tetC, tetG, ermA, ermC, ermF, sul1, sul2, and intI1 proliferated. These ARGs began to proliferate on the 5th day, and the abundance increased significantly on the 12th day. This may be due to the proliferation of bacteria carrying these ARGs during the maturation phase.", "Figure 2Abundances of tetracycline resistance genes during swine manure composting.

The sequences data reported in this study have been deposited in NCBI SRA with the accession number PRJNA663659 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/; PRJNA663659). Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetae, and Proteobacteria were the most dominant flora during the two kinds of composting. However, their relative abundances varied significantly at different phases of composting (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the structural composition of AB and CK between the mesophilic phase and thermophilic phase. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were dominant flora during the mesophilic phase. However, Firmicutes accounted for more than 95% during the thermophilic phase. In the maturation phase, there was a significant difference in community structure between AB and CK. Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria in group AB were 23.8 and 3.1% higher than those in group CK, respectively. But Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in group AB were 17.3 and 9.5% lower than those in group CK, respectively.", "Figure 4Structure and abundance of flora at the phylum level.

In the mesophilic phase, the composition of CK and AB flora was similar. Kurthia showed the highest abundance, followed by Acinetobacter, Escherichia, Shigella, Streptococcus, and Treponema. In the thermophilic phase (day 2), Bacillus showed the highest abundance. The Bacillus abundance of the AB group was higher than that of the CK group, which may be due to the addition of compound microbial inoculants. At the end of composting, the abundance of Bacillus dropped dramatically, replaced by Sphingobacterium, Ochrobactrum, Cellvibrio, etc. From the results, the microbial community structure at different stages of the composting was quite different. The addition of compound microbial inoculants changed the community structure during composting.", "Figure 5Heat map of species abundance at the genus level in compost.

HPB assigned to 10 genera were detected during composting, among which Unclassified Bacilli, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, and Escherichia/Shigella were dominant. The abundance of pathogens decreased sharply during the thermophilic phase on the 2nd day of composting. At the end of composting, the relative abundance of HPB in the CK group decreased by 78.16%, and the AB group decreased by 86.77%. At the end of composting, the composition of composting bacteria in the two groups was different.

The results showed that the selected environmental variables explained a total of 79.48% of species changes. Temperature, moisture, TC, TN, and C/N were significantly correlated with microbial communities, and pH had little effect on the community. Actinobacteria and Tenericutes were more affected by environmental factors. The change of TN content had a greater influence on Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Temperature and C/N changes were closely related to Firmicutes. Combined with the stage of composting, TC, and moisture played important roles in mesophilic phase. At the thermophilic phase, temperature and C/N played important roles. During the maturation phase, TN and pH affected microbial community changes.", "Figure 7Redundancy analysis between environmental factors and microbial community structure (phylum level).

As shown in Figure 8, tetL, tetO, tetW, and intI1 were significantly positively correlated with Streptococcus, Christensenellaceae, and Ruminococcaceae. ermQ and blaTEM were significantly positively correlated with Acinetobacter. ermB, tetH, blaCTX, tetQ, tetM, and tn916 were significantly positively correlated with Acinetobacter, Kurthia, and Treponema_2. These microflora occupy a dominant position in the early stage of composting and were greatly reduced in the maturation phase, so these ARGs were also reduced. On the other hand, tetA, tetC, tetG, ermF, sul1, and sul2 were significantly positively correlated with Sphingobacterium, Paenochrobactrum, Ochrobactrum, and Cellvibrio. These microflora occupy a dominant position during the maturation phase of composting, so these ARGs proliferate at the end of composting. However, ermA and ermC failed to match the related flora, and possibly because of the low abundance of host bacteria, they could not enter the forefront of species matching.", "Figure 8Correlation between antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and microbial community.
