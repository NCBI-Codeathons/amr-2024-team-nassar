Cell cultures were exposed to a low concentration of BTZ (IC10: 1.5 nM) which was gradually (stepwise) increased to 100 nM of BTZ over a period of 6 months. JY cells stably growing in BTZ concentrations of 35nM (JY/35) and 100nM (JY/100) were used for further characterization.", "Figure\n1A shows the growth inhibition profiles of JY/WT, JY/35 and JY/100 cells after 72 hrs treatment with BTZ, revealing a clear shift in drug concentrations causing 50% cell growth inhibition (IC50 value) in JY/35 and JY/100 cells.

This mechanism included BTZ-induced single point mutations in the PSMB5 gene, as well as a selective overexpression of mutant PSMB5 protein\n[38,39,41]. Here, we tested whether this mechanism would also apply for BTZ-resistant JY cells. We first determined whether PSMB5 harbored any of the previously described mutations\n[38-41]. Indeed, in JY/35 cells as well as JY/100 cells, a single G to T nucleotide shift was identified at nucleotide position 311 in exon 2 of the PSMB5 gene (Additional file\n1: Figure S1). In the mature and functional \u03b25-subunit protein, this mutation introduced a Met to Ile substitution at amino acid 45. It is noteworthy that the mutation in PSMB5 in JY/35 and JY/100 cells is heterozygous, indicating that these cells would still harbor one unaffected allele. We next determined the expression of the constitutive and immunoproteasome subunits at both mRNA and protein levels (Figure\n2). Compared to JY/WT cells, mRNA levels of the constitutive proteasome subunits, in particular PSMB5 (\u03b25) and PSMB7 (\u03b22), were significantly increased (up to 4.5 fold) in JY/BTZ cells, whereas the increase in the mRNA of immunoproteasome subunits was much less pronounced (Figure\n2A). Consistent with these data, protein levels of constitutive proteasome subunits were increased in BTZ-resistant JY cells (up to 2-fold), whereas the expression levels of immunoproteasome subunits remained largely unaltered (Figure\n2B-D).", "Figure 2Constitutive and immunoproteasome composition in JY cells and BTZ-resistant variants.

In fact, no significant changes were found in the cell surface expression of HLA-ABC (MHC-class I), HLA-DR (MHC-class II), and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD40 in JY/35 and JY/100 cells compared to JY/WT cells (Additional file\n1: Figure S2). Further confirmation that BTZ selection had no impact on antigen presentation was provided by the observation that JY/WT and BTZ-resistant cells showed no difference in their capacity to induce allogeneic T-cell proliferation (Additional file\n1: Figure S3). Of note, short term (24 hr) incubations with maximal non-toxic concentrations of BTZ also did not affect their ability to induce proliferation of allo-T-cells (Additional file\n1: Figure S3).", "Cytokine release capacity by BTZ-resistant JY cells", "Activated B cells are able to produce cytokines and consequently contribute to inflammation\n[43] or protective cytokine environments\n[44]. To this end, we examined the secretion profile of the prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 by activated JY cells and explored whether or not this profile is altered in JY/BTZ cells. Beyond basal secretion levels, we also assessed the impact of co-incubation with BTZ on TNF-\u03b1 production. Upon activation with PMA and ionomycin, JY cells produced TNF-\u03b1 levels of 7000 \u00b1 3700 pg/ml, which was diminished by 20% in the presence of 10 nM BTZ (Figure\n3). Basal levels of TNF-\u03b1 production in JY/35 cells was approximately half of JY/WT cells, and could be further suppressed in the presence of 35 nM BTZ. Strikingly, basal TNF-\u03b1 production in JY/100 was markedly decreased to levels < 5% of JY/WT cells. Together, these results indicate that upon acquisition of BTZ resistance, JY cells are markedly suppressed in their capacity to secrete TNF-\u03b1.", "Figure 3TNF-\u03b1 release by JY/WT cells and BTZ-resistant variants JY/35BTZ and JY/100BTZ.

Consistent with this notion, we observed that CD20 expression was significantly decreased on JY/WT cells exposed for up to 48 hrs to 5 nM BTZ (Figure\n5A). In comparison, no effect of BTZ treatment was observed for HLA-DR expression (Figure\n5B). Unlike in JY/WT cells, treatment of JY/35 and JY/100 cells with BTZ (35 nM and 100 nM BTZ, respectively) had no significant effect on CD20 expression (Figure\n5A). In order to establish whether protein ubiquitination status after short-term (24\u201348 hr) BTZ treatment is associated with down-regulation of CD20 expression in JY/WT cells and unaltered CD20 expression in JY/BTZ cells, Western blot analysis of total ubiquitinated proteins was performed with control and BTZ- exposed cells. Figure\n5C shows a typical smear of (poly) ubiquitinated proteins when JY/WT cells were incubated with 10 nM BTZ for 24 hrs. Conversely, no accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins were observed in JY/35 and JY/100 cells exposed to 35 nM and 100 nM BTZ, respectively.
