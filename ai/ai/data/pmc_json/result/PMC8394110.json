["3. Results and Discussion", "3.1. Species Classification of Strain B28", "Strain B28 was isolated from kimchi and identified as B. polyfermenticus in a previous investigation [19]. However, currently, the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain B28 had 99.9% identity with those of B. amyloliquefaciens MT45 and B. siamensis SCSIO 05746 (Figure 1A). By MLST, which is used for discrimination among Bacillus species [31], B28 clustered with B. siamensis and separated from B. amyloliquefaciens (Figure 1B). In phylogenetic analysis of the eight housekeeping genes used for MLST, B28 grouped with B. siamensis (Figure S1). ANI values of the B28 genome sequence were 98.61%, 97.73%, 94.28%, and 94.06% with B. siamensis KCTC 13613T, B. siamensis SCSIO 05746, B. velezensis Y2, and B. amyloliquefaciens DSM7T, respectively. Thus, strain B28 was reclassified as Bacillus siamensis.", "3.2. General Genome Characteristics of Strain B28", "The complete genome of B. siamensis strain B28 included a circular chromosome (3,946,178 bp) and two circular plasmids (Table 1). The G+C mol% of the genome of strain B28 was 45.85%. The genome contained 86 tRNA genes and 27 rRNA genes. The genome of strain B28 was bigger than that of the strain type KCTC 13613T and smaller than that of strain SCSIO 05746, which was the only other complete genome of a B. siamensis strain available by 15 March 2021 (Table 1).", "Analysis using COG functional categorization and SEED subsystem categorization, respectively, predicted 3573 and 1663 coding sequences (CDSs) in the genome of strain B28. COG analysis was revealed that amino acid transport and metabolism (291 genes, 8.14%) was the most abundant category, followed by transcription (266 genes, 7.44%) and carbohydrate transport and metabolism (214 genes, 5.99%) (Figure S2A). The order of abundance was similar in strain KCTC 13613T and SCSIO 05746 (Figure S2A).", "In data from the SEED subsystem, 297 genes in the strain B28 genome (17.86%) were assigned to amino acid biosynthesis (Figure S2B). The next most abundant subsystem category was protein metabolism (211 genes, 12.69%), followed by carbohydrates (191 genes, 11.49%). These patterns were similar in the genome of strain KCTC 13613T and SCSIO 05746.", "Strain B28 possessed the two circular plasmids pB2801 (6.1 kb) and pB2802 (5.4 kb). Two replication protein genes (B28_04055 in p2801 and B28_04064 in pB2802), which are related to plasmid replication, were detected. However, most of the genes were annotated as hypothetical protein genes.", "To identify the unique genes of strain B28, we analyzed the shared genes between the genomes of B28 and SCSIO 05746, but not KCTC 13613T as the genome is incomplete. The number of genes shared by the genomes of B. siamensis strains B28 and SCSIO 05746 is illustrated in a Venn diagram (Figure S3). The two strains share 3487 CDSs in their core genome, corresponding to approximately 91.2% and 84.0% of the CDSs in strains B28 and SCSIO 05746, respectively. The majority of strain-specific genes are associated with hypothetical proteins (Table S1). However, unique assigned CDSs of strain B28 included a relaxase, transposase, \u03b1-galactosidase, and triacylglycerol lipase. The \u03b1-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22; gene locus: JD965_RS14670) and triacylglycerol lipase (EC 3.1.1.3; JD965_RS01465) genes were located on the chromosome. \u03b1-Galactosidase is an exoglycosidase, which breaks terminal \u03b1-1,6 galactosidase bonds of melibiose, raffinose and polymeric galactomannans [36]. This enzyme contributes to the mitigation of intestinal discomfort in humans by improving the digestibility of carbohydrates such as melibiose and stachyose, which are contained in soybean foods [37]. Triacylglycerol lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol and generates free fatty acids, monoacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and glycerol. This enzyme contributes to the enhancement of flavor during food fermentation [38]. Therefore, these genes in strain B28 may contribute to the enhancement of human health and the sensory properties of foods if the bacterium were used as a probiotic or fermentation starter, respectively.", "3.3. Insights into Virulence of B. siamensis Strain B28", "The food pathogen B. cereus produces several enterotoxins: three hemolytic enterotoxins, (NblA, NblC, and NblD), three nonhemolytic enterotoxins (NheA, NheB, and NheC), and one enterotoxin T (BcET) [35,39]. Although B. siamensis is a member of the same genus as notorious pathogenic B. cereus, B. siamensis is nonpathogenic. The absence of enterotoxin-encoding genes in B. siamensis strain B28 was verified by PCR (Figure S4). Moreover, no toxin-related genes were identified in the strain B28 genome.", "We also checked the antibiotic susceptibility of, and hemolysis by, strain B28. The strain was sensitive to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamycin, lincomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin, and did not exhibit \u03b2-hemolytic activity (Figure S4).", "The genome of strain B28 does encode a hemolysin-III like protein gene (hlyIII; JD965_RS10690). A homologous gene was also identified in B. siamensis strain SCSIO 05746, and in the closely related species B. amyloliquefaciens and B. velezensis (Table 2). Although hemolysis was verified for HlyIII from Vibrio vulnificus on overexpression in E. coli [40], its homolog in Bacteriodes fragilis was not linked to hemolytic activity [41]. Moreover, in our previous studies, the hlyIII gene was detected regardless of phenotypic hemolysis [42,43,44,45]. Therefore, we suggest that the hlyIII gene in B. siamensis strain B28 is not related to hemolysis.", "Putative efflux pumps or transporter genes for bicyclomycin, lincomycin, multiple drugs, and tetracycline were identified on the chromosomes of B. siamensis strains B28 and SCSIO 05746 (Table 2). However, strain B28 did not exhibit resistance to lincomycin or tetracycline (Figure S4). These genes have previously been identified in the genomes of several strains that did not show resistance to the respective antibiotics [15,42], and the genes were detected on the chromosomes of B. amyloliquefaciens and B. velezensis, not on plasmids. These results imply that these were not acquired antibiotic resistance genes (Table 2). Therefore, we suggest that the annotated chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes in the B28 genome are not strain-specific and may not actually contribute to antibiotic resistance.", "Overall, phenotypic and genomic analyses suggest that B. siamensis strain B28 is a safe bacterium for use in food and medicine.", "3.4. Probiotic Properties of B. siamensis Strain B28", "The live microorganisms in probiotics have health benefits for humans and animals [46]. Generally, the requirements for probiotics are acid tolerance for passage through the gastric tract (to reach the intestine); the ability to survive in harsh conditions, including in manufacturing processes and the human/animal gut; adherence in the gut; antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria; carbohydrate, lipid, and protein use; and health enhancement, such as enhancement of immunogenicity.", "3.4.1. Survivability of Strain B28", "The genome of B. siamensis strain B28 suggests that spore-forming ability, biofilm formation, and cholylglycine hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.24; a bile salt hydrolase) might aid survival of this strain in extreme conditions (Table S2). The B28 genome encodes spore-forming genes including spore wall synthetic proteins, as well as proteins for spore germination. Species that can form spores can withstand the harsh conditions used by the food processing industry, such as high temperatures. Biofilm-producing bacteria can also persist in extreme environments, and strain B28 possesses genes related to biofilm formation. These results indicate that B. siamensis strain B28 might reach the intestinal tract via biofilm formation, spore formation, and/or the deconjugation of bile salts.", "3.4.2. Adhesive Ability of Strain B28", "Successful probiotics should be able to adhere in the gut [47]. Biofilms, exopolysaccharide (EPS), fibronectin, and flagella are factors related to adhesion [48,49,50,51]. The B28 genome suggests that EPS can be produced during biofilm formation (Table S2). It also contains genes related to fibronectin biosynthesis and flagellum formation.", "3.4.3. Antibacterial Activity", "The antibacterial activity of B. siamensis strain B28 against eight foodborne pathogens was evaluated via an agar plate diffusion method. The strain inhibited the growth of the Gram-positive strains B. cereus and S. aureus and the Gram-negative strains Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, E. coli, Flavobacterium, Salmonella enterica, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Figure 2).", "The B28 genome includes two bacteriocin-related operons\u2014the bacitracin operon and the mesentericin operon (Figure 2). Bacitracin is a branched cyclic dodecylpeptide antibiotic synthesized nonribosomaly [52] that interferes with cell wall synthesis [53]. The bacitracin operon of strain B28 includes genes encoding a small membrane protein (liaI), phage shock protein (liaH), antibacterial peptide (liaG), transporter (liaF), sensor kinase (liaS), and response regulator (liaR) (Figure 2). Mesentericin is a small non-lantibiotic bacteriocin that shows bactericidal activity [54]. These gene sets might confer the phenotypical antibacterial activities of strain B28. Bacteriocin-producing bacteria have an advantage in the gut. These results suggest that strain B28 is a potential probiotic with antimicrobial activity.", "3.4.4. Potential for Health Enhancement by Strain B28", "The strain B28 genome indicates the ability to supply the essential amino acids, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine, in the intestine via synthesis from glucose (Table S3 and Figure 3). Strain B28 also possesses genes for the production of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from glutamate and branched chain fatty acids (BCFAs) from isoleucine, leucine, and valine (Figure 3). GABA and BCFAs are bioactive compounds that are important for human health; for example, they show anti-proliferative activity [55,56]. Genomic analysis also revealed that strain B28 encodes two gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) genes (EC 2.3.2.2; JD965_RS09945 and JD965_RS17695) involved in the production of \u03b3-glutamyl peptide from free amino acids; \u03b3-glutamyl peptide has beneficial effects in human tissue, such as antioxidation and anticancer activities [57]. The B. siamensis B28 genome possesses a subtilisin-encoding gene (EC 3.4.21.62; nattokinase; JD965_RS05730); subtilisin shows antithrombotic and antihypertensive effects [58]. These analyses suggest that strain B28 might supply essential amino acids and bioactive compounds to a human host through the gut.", "Previously, B. siamensis strain B28 was found to inhibit the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and \u03b2-catenin in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. \u03b2-catenin is important for carcinogenesis and tumor progression. We assumed that the effect on microphthalmia-associated transcription factor contributed to the whitening effects of strain B28 [19]. To find the genetic basis for these effects, we searched the strain B28 genome for tyrosinase inhibitors (for the whitening effect) and regulators of \u03b2-catenin expression. Tyrosinase plays a key role in melanogenesis in mammals, and bacteria produce tyrosinase inhibitors during fermentation [59]. The B28 genome possesses genes for uracil, lipoteichoic acid, and glutathione synthesis; these compounds are tyrosinase inhibitors found in microorganisms [59,60] (Figure 4 and Table S4). Moreover, glutathione is involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species, which induces \u03b2-catenin expression [61]; the B28 genome also encodes several enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, and superoxidase dismutase) that scavenge reactive oxygen species (Table S4). Additionally, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (EC 2.7.11.1) activity could affect \u03b2-catenin expression, and the B28 genome contains eight genes for the production of glycogen synthase kinase-3 [62] (Table S4).", "Bacillus siamensis was registered in 2010 [63] and the predominant species in fermented foods [64,65]. Bacillus siamensis showed the enzymatic activities which conferred the enhancement of sensory properties [64,65]. Therefore, B. siamensis was suggested as a starter candidate species for food fermentation. Our current experimental results provide genomic insights into B. siamensis strain B28 and suggest that it lacks acquired antibiotic resistance, hemolysin, and enterotoxin genes. The genome indicates that strain B28 possesses genes for survival in harsh conditions, adhesion, antibacterial activity against foodborne pathogens, essential amino acid synthesis, and the enhancement of human health. These results suggested the possibility of using B. siamensis strain B28 as a safe probiotic strain. B. siamensis strain B28 could be developed for use as a valuable food by the functional food, feed, and medical industries."]
