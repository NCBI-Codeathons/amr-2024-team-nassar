["2. Results and Discussion", "2.1. Discovery and Purification of the Myxobacterial Biarylitide MeYLH", "A previously conducted phylogenetic analysis of bytO-related genes revealed that the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus sp. CA032A harbors a genetic operon that putatively encodes a cytochrome-P450-dependent enzyme and a pentapeptide precursor [24], indicating the presence of an associated myxobacterial biarylitide. Similar to Pyxidicoccus sp. CA032A, the myxobacterial strain Pyxidicoccus fallax An d48 (formerly known as Angiococcus disciformis An d48)\u2014a strain that has already been shown to be a prolific producer of bacterial secondary metabolites [25,26,27]\u2014contains the biarylitide ORF bytA with the encoded peptide sequence MNYLH. In contrast to previously reported members of the biarylitide BGC family, the precursor peptide encoding gene bytA is not only clustered with a bytO gene homolog encoding a cytochrome-P450-dependent enzyme (91.5% amino acid identity to Pyxidicoccus sp. CA032A homolog and 40.7% identical sites to Planomonospora sp. ID82291/ID107089, Figures S2 and S3) but also with an S-adenosyl-methionine-(SAM)-dependent methyltransferase gene that we named bytZ (Figure 2).", "Analysis of the secondary metabolome of the corresponding bacterium P. fallax An d48 revealed compound 1 as a peak in the liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) chromatogram at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 222.615 [M + 2H]2+, supporting the deduced molecular formula C22H31N5O52+ at a retention time of 0.7 min (Figure 3A). The polar nature of 1, which is reflected by its early elution during LC-MS analysis, is consistent with the characteristics of previously reported biarylitides [24]. In addition, the deduced molecular formula of 1 (C22H31N5O52+) matches the mass of a methylated cyclic tripeptide with the sequence YLH. In addition to that, the identified molecule shows a neutral loss fragment, which was clearly assigned in the tandem MS spectrum of 1 as leucine/isoleucine (Figure S7). These findings strongly supported our assumption that the discovery of 1 can be assigned as the first myxobacterial biarylitide MeYLH.", "Interestingly, the production of 1 is dependent on the myxobacterial culture medium (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, the production of 1 is only observed when P. fallax An d48 is cultivated in a medium containing microorganisms that have been inactivated by autoclaving. Apart from that, the type of inactivated microorganism in the fermentation medium (in our case E. coli or S. cerevisiae) seemed to only play a minor role in the production levels. The finding that biotic or abiotic elicitors can enhance the production of natural products has been described before for numerous different microorganisms [28,29,30]; myxobacteria in particular are well-known for their complex connection between secondary metabolite production and cellular development stages [2,31]. Nevertheless, the molecular regulation mechanism responsible for biarylitide production in P. fallax An d48 remains elusive.", "To isolate secondary metabolite 1, P. fallax An d48 was cultivated in a VY medium in larger-scale batch fermentation. Since the poor solubility of 1 in organic solvents and water hindered efficient compound purification, a tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group was introduced at the N-terminal secondary amine moiety by stirring the culture supernatant with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) at an ambient temperature to yield the semi-synthetic compound 2 (Scheme 1). The purification of 2 was achieved by liquid/liquid partitioning of the reaction mixture followed by semi-preparative HPLC with MS detection. The deprotection of 2 to regain the original secondary metabolite, 1, was achieved by stirring the pure compound suspended in dichloromethane with 20% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at room temperature until full conversion was observed.", "2.2. Structure Elucidation of 1 and 2", "HRESIMS indicates an [M + H]+ monoisotopic mass peak for 2 at m/z 544.2765, consistent with the molecular formula C27H38N5O7 (m/z calculated for [M + H]+ 544.2766) with 12 double-bond equivalents (DBEs). 1H-NMR and HSQC spectra in methanol-d4 reveal five aromatic double-bond signals at \u03b4(1H) = 7.94 (1H, s) \u03b4(13C) = 138.5, \u03b4(1H) = 7.03 (1H, d, J = 8.13 Hz) \u03b4(13C) = 130.2, \u03b4(1H) = 6.91 (1H, s) \u03b4(13C) = 118.9, \u03b4(1H) = 6.89 (1H, brs) \u03b4(13C) = 118.1 and \u03b4(1H) = 6.84 (1H, m) \u03b4(13C) = 126.1 ppm. Three \u03b1-proton signals are located at \u03b4(1H) = 4.86 (1H, s) \u03b4(13C) = 52.8, \u03b4(1H) = 4.66 (1H, m) \u03b4(13C) = 59.7 and \u03b4(1H) = 4.61 ppm (1H, dd, J = 12.62, 2.78 Hz) \u03b4(13C) = 55.2. Furthermore, two diastereotopic methylene signals could be observed at \u03b4(1H) = 3.55, 2.56 (2H, dd, J = 15.19, 11.77 Hz) \u03b4(13C) = 34.2 as well as at \u03b4(1H) = 3.32, 2.82 (2H, dd, 16.47, 12.62 Hz) \u03b4(13C) = 33.0 with another methylene signal at \u03b4(1H) = 1.58 (2H, m) \u03b4(13C) = 43.7 ppm. Lastly, one methine signal appears at \u03b4(1H) = 1.60 (1H, m) \u03b4(13C) = 26.1 and three methyl signals at \u03b4(1H) = 2.90 (3H, s) \u03b4(13C) = 30.7, \u03b4(1H) = 1.48 (9H, s) \u03b4(13C) = 28.8 and \u03b4(1H) = 0.94 (6H, m) \u03b4(13C) = 23.8 ppm. Comprehensive analysis of COSY and HMBC correlations confirmed the presence of a cyclic tripeptide consisting of leucine, histidine and a Boc-protected, N-methylated tyrosine with a characteristic C\u2013N-biaryl bond between histidine and tyrosine (Figure 4). The signal at \u03b4(13C) = 177.8 ppm exhibits a downfield shift characteristic for free carboxyl functions and shows HMBC correlations to the methine signal at \u03b4(1H) = 4.61 ppm as well as the diastereotopic methylene signal at \u03b4(1H) = 3.32, 2.82 ppm of the histidine part. Moreover, HMBC correlation of the methyl signal at \u03b4(1H) = 2.90 ppm to the \u03b1-proton signal at \u03b4(1H) = 4.66 ppm proves the N-methylation of the tyrosine part. Additionally, Boc protection of the same nitrogen could be underpinned by the HMBC correlation of the mentioned methyl signal at \u03b4(1H) = 2.90 ppm to the carbonyl signal at \u03b4(13C) = 157.6 ppm possessing a characteristic shift for carbamate function. The corresponding three methyl groups of the Boc moiety can be observed at \u03b4(1H) = 1.48 ppm exhibiting HMBC correlations to the quaternary carbon at \u03b4(13C) = 81.9 ppm. For additional evidence an 1H-15N HMBC experiment was carried out using standard parameters and uncovered a characteristic low field 15N NMR chemical shift for N20 of the imidazole moiety with \u03b4(15N) = 247.3 ppm showing correlations to the respective aromatic double-bond signals at \u03b4(1H) = 7.94 and 6.91 ppm as well as to the diastereotopic methylene signals at \u03b4(1H) = 3.32, 2.82 ppm. Furthermore, \u03b4(15N) = 174.6 ppm is the chemical shift for N19, which also evince correlations to the respective two aromatic double-bond signals. The peptidic NH18 of the histidine exhibits a signal at \u03b4(15N) = 123.1 ppm with correlations to the diastereotopic methylene signals at \u03b4(1H) = 3.32, 2.82 ppm. Unfortunately, no 1H-15N HMBC signal could be observed for peptidic NH17, but the presence of leucine was underpinned by Marfey\u2019s derivatization experiments. Finally, the methylcarbamate N16, with a characteristic high field chemical shift at \u03b4(15N) = 84.7 ppm, possesses a correlation to the methyl signal at \u03b4(1H) = 2.90 ppm, which is additional proof for the position of methylation. Selective 1D NOESY experiments were performed to propose the biaryl bond to be located between C6 and N19 or N20 using standard parameters and a mixing time of 350 \u00b5s. The first experiment was adapted for the selective excitation of C5\u2033 at \u03b4(1H) = 7.94 ppm with a distance of 17.20 Hz resulting in no additional signals in the 1H spectrum, which could indicate the spatial distance to the tyrosine ring. The second measurement was optimized for the excitation of C6\u2033 at \u03b4(1H) = 6.91 ppm with a distance of 20.32 Hz. Hereby, an additional 1H signal at \u03b4(1H) = 7.03 ppm (C9) appeared, which is likely to be the correlation between C9 and C5 at \u03b4(1H) = 6.84 ppm that was also excited under the given conditions. Since no correlation between C5\u2033 and C5 could be found, the biaryl bond is most likely located between C6 and N19.", "NMR experiments for 1\u2014after Boc deprotection\u2014were carried out in DMSO-d6 due to previously mentioned solubility issues. Therefore, the majority of observed signals are more upfield shifted. More prominent shift changes could be observed for the two proton signals of the histidine at \u03b4(1H) = 9.35 (1H, s) \u03b4(13C) = 135.6 and \u03b4(1H) = 7.16 (1H, s) \u03b4(13C) = 120.4 ppm. Due to the presence of both histidine protons, the characteristic C\u2013N-biaryl bond between histidine and tyrosine is again ensured. The same is true for the N-methylation of the tyrosine, with a methyl signal at \u03b4(1H) = 2.50 (3H, m) \u03b4(13C) = 31.3. Furthermore, COSY and HMBC spectra exhibit correlations for two amide protons at \u03b4(1H) = 8.86 (1H, d, J = 9.52 Hz) and \u03b4(1H) = 9.21 (1H, d, J = 8.56 Hz) ppm as well as for the N-H proton of the N-methylated amine at \u03b4(1H) = 8.79 (1H, brs) ppm. The latter seems to isomerize with a N-H signal at \u03b4(1H) = 9.31 (1H, brs), which could be due to the deprotection reaction at this amine.", "The assignment of the absolute configuration was based on Marfey\u2019s derivatization method. [32] Acidic hydrolysis and the derivatization of the hydrolysis product of 1 with d-respective l-(1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-leucine amide) (FDLA) revealed C2, C2\u2032 and C2\u2033 to be S and the tyrosine, leucine and histidine to thus be l-configured as the respective products have the same retention time as the derivatized l-amino acid standards (Figures S24\u2013S29). These results are in line with expectations, since 1 most likely originates from a RiPP biosynthesis pathway. In order to validate the ribosomal origin of 1 (and the prediction of the stereochemical configurations in 1) we attempted to perform heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes bytA, bytO and bytZ in the established myxobacterial host, M. xanthus DK1622 [31].", "Compounds 1 and 2 showed no antimicrobial activity in the performed biological assays (Table 1). The outcome of the bioactivity profiling of 1 and 2 reflects previous findings that these bridged tri/tetrapeptide RiPPs such as the cittilins and biarylitides are not active as antimicrobial compounds [21,24]. Thus, the biological function of these compounds remains unknown.", "2.3. Heterologous Expression and Biosynthesis", "The small genetic operon in P. fallax An d48 consisting of bytA, bytO and bytZ was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the expression vector pFPVan_mx8, a derivative based on the plasmid pFPVan_pcyA [26] (Tables S9\u2013S13). The resulting expression plasmid, pFPVan_mx8_bytAOZ, features a kanamycin resistance gene for clonal selection in the heterologous host M. xanthus DK1622, a vanillate-inducible promoter system to control the expression of bytAOZ and the Mx8 integrase gene, which enables the integration of the expression plasmid pFPVan_mx8_bytAOZ into the attB1 or attB2 sites of M. xanthus DK1622 [31].", "The host strain M. xanthus DK1622 was transformed with the generated expression construct via electroporation, and genetically verified transformants were investigated via LC-MS for the production of 1. Subsequent heterologous expression of the myxobacterial biarylitide MeYLH BGC did yield 1 at low concentrations according to LC-MS analysis after vanillate supplementation of the transformants\u2019 fermentation cultures (Figure 5). The respective mutant strain showed, without vanillate supplementation, only trace amounts of 1, presumably due to the basal expression of bytAOZ; previously developed biotechnological production platforms using the vanillate-inducible promoter system displayed even higher production titers of the associated natural product under un-induced cultivation conditions [33]. One possible explanation for the rather inefficient heterologous production of 1 might be that in the heterologous production setup the catalytic enzyme responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal residue is missing. For that reason, the N-terminal cleavage might be catalyzed by a different protease in M. xanthus DK1622 that shows lower catalytic activity.", "Combining the results from the heterologous expression with the current knowledge of biarylitide biosynthesis, we conclude that the biosynthesis of 1 starts with the ribosomally synthesized pentapeptide MNYLH, which is processed by the cytochrome-P450-dependent enzyme BytO to install the C\u2013N biaryl linkage between the histidine and tyrosine. This modified pentapeptide is cleaved by the catalytic action of a generic protease to yield the non-methylated biosynthetic intermediate 1a. This generic protease could also derive from another (RiPP) BGC, as previously described for the biosynthesis of argicyclamides [34]. The final tailoring step is probably catalyzed by BytZ to methylate the N-terminal free amine (Scheme 2). In conclusion, the successful heterologous production of 1 in M. xanthus DK1622 does not only prove the connection of the initially identified biarylitide BGC to its secondary metabolite, but also strongly supports the prediction of the absolute configuration of 1 as (2S, 2\u2032S, 2\u2033S)."]
