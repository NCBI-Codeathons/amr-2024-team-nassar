["2. Results", "2.1. High-Scale Ami Production and Purification", "The deep functional microbiome profiling method reported recently [5] consists of encapsulating single microorganisms of exotic microbiomes in isolated biocompatible microcompartments, estimating their biological or biochemical activity with fluorescent probes, and selecting subpopulations of interest based on a combination of fluorescent reporters (Figure 1). This technology is based on the application of droplet microfluidics allowing the generation of double water-in-oil-in-water (W/OW) emulsion droplets with precisely controlled size, in particularly mild emulsification conditions. Droplets serve as microbioreactors in which cultivation, co-cultivation, biocatalytic assays, or vital staining can be carried out. Specific combinations of fluorescent reporters indicate the functionality of the encapsulated species. The combinations of fluorescent reporters trigger FACS-assisted selection of the populations of interest. The selected populations are analyzed by classical cultivation-based assays including downstream activity profiling, proteomics, and metabolomics or examined by whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics to trace unculturable or slow-growing species.", "The described functional profiling platform was applied for the isolation of Ami-producing B. pumilus strains, and we exploited it to select the most efficient Ami producers from the same source of the microbiota. We isolated more than 50 Ami-producing B. pumilus clones totally, which were evaluated for Ami production. About 28% of them had a similar level of antagonistic activity, and we associated them with the same strain of origin. The isolated B. pumilus strains produced remarkable (>40 mm) zones of clearance that were observed using a reporter S. aureus (MRSA) strain (Figure 2A, 2B). However, cultivation in a nutritionally rich 2YT medium with limited aeration resulted in mediocre Ami production (Figure 2C), while increased aeration facilitated Ami production by more than sixfold (Figure 2C). Hence, we concluded that the cultivation conditions are particularly important for efficient Ami production. Previous proteomics observations [5] indicated that the activation of inosine monophosphate (IMP) biosynthesis, peptidoglycan synthesis, as well as flagellum organization correlate with cultivation in the thin layer associated with Ami production. Taking this into account, we suggested boosting the activation of Ami biosynthesis by high carbohydrate concentrations, in turn mediating the activation of IMP synthesis and facilitating the formation of peptidoglycan [21]. Previously, we associated flagellum organization in B. pumilus with biofilm formation. Hence, we reasoned that stimulation of cell\u2013cell contacts is essential for high-scale Ami production, and this results in differences in Ami production during cultivation in liquid and semi-liquid growth medium. We stimulated cell\u2013cell interactions and adhesion by the addition of calcium carbonate microparticles. The resulting SYC medium allowed a more than eightfold increase in Ami production in comparison with 2YT medium (Figure 2D). The concentration of Ami in 2YT medium could be increased by cultivation in shaking flasks in a decreased volume. However, this will not be convenient for Ami high-scale production.", "The subsequent purification was simplified by solid-phase extraction (SPE) with a polystyrene-based resin (Figure 3A) followed by subsequent polishing on a C18 HPLC column (Figure 3B\u2013D).", "SPE resulted in a highly Ami-enriched fraction eluted with 35% acetonitrile (ACN), which was efficiently purified by C18 RP-HPLC, resulting in pure Ami (Figure 3D). These steps are scalable and could be adopted for extensive bioproduction.", "2.2. The Activity Spectrum of Ami", "The purified Ami was used to characterize its activity spectrum using standard cultivation assays and deep functional profiling of microbiomes for Ami resistance. Deep functional profiling of microbiomes for Ami resistance is based on the cultivation of single bacteria from a particular microbiome in droplets with various concentrations of Ami, followed by their viability staining, FACS-based selection, metagenomic sequencing, and quantitative estimation of live bacteria via bioinformatics [5]. Here, we used a broad panel of clinical isolates to provide a more comprehensive description of the Ami activity spectrum (Figure 4).", "Generally, Ami is active against Gram-positive non-spore-forming bacteria, including Lactobacillales and Staphylococcaceae. Ami is inactive toward Bacillus that we associate with homologs of AmiN kinase reported previously. Ami displayed antibacterial activity against some laboratory strains of Escherichia coli [11]. However, it showed only mediocre activity against E. coli wild strains. Moreover, Ami was ineffective against an especially valuable Gram-negative cohort of ESKAPE pathogens (K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species), while it was highly active against the overwhelming majority of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus strains (referred to as \u201cE\u201d and \u201cS\u201d ESKAPE pathogens, respectively). These bacteria represent the most clinically relevant fraction of Gram-positive pathogens, particularly associated with AR. Distinct Bacteroides, including Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides vulgatus, were also sensitive to Ami (Figure 4). However, the majority of strains representing mutualistic gastrointestinal microbiota components were resistant to Ami, indicating Ami limited potential against this critical microbiota component.", "2.3. Exceptional Instability of Ami", "It was previously reported [9,20], and we also observed [5], that Ami (AmiA) is not stable in aqueous solutions and transforms into biologically inactive products, i.e., amicoumacin B (AmiB) and amicoumacin C (AmiC) (Figure 5A).", "Ami has a terminal amide bond that is exceptionally unstable, and we decided to study this feature in detail. We observed that Ami decomposition is pH-dependent, accelerating rapidly from low acidic to neutral pH and reaching a maximum at pH 7\u20139 (Figure 5B,D). The analysis of Ami decomposition kinetics revealed that Ami spontaneously converts into lactone AmiC, which subsequently hydrolyzes to AmiB (Figure 5C). Our data indicate that even if direct conversion of Ami into AmiB was observed, it should be more than an order of magnitude slower than the transition of Ami into AmiC. Hence, the rate-limiting step of Ami hydrolysis is the first reaction, resulting in AmiC formation by intramolecular lactonization. We suggest that Ami structure determines Ami instability by the formation of the energetically favored five-membered ring transition state, accelerating its self-inactivation by lactonization (Figure 5A). Hence, AmiC lactone acts as an improvised intermediate state, substantially decreasing the energetic barrier of amide hydrolysis. We suppose this self-lactonization step provides the main contribution to Ami instability, decreasing its half-life from years, as reported for other terminal amides [22], to less than 2 h at pH 8 and 37 \u00b0C. The observed pH dependence indicates the potential impact of the Ami amine group on self-lactonization. This amine group has an estimated pKa of ~7.2. We suggest its protonation is critical for the self-conversion of Ami into AmiC, accelerating when pH increases from 5 to 7 and reaching a maximum at pH 7\u20139. We speculate that the effect of the protonated amine is mediated by intramolecular stabilization of the \u2013OH\u03b4- nucleophile. Alternatively, the protonated amine could serve as an intramolecular proton donor for the ammonia leaving group. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of this particular Ami instability should be thoroughly investigated in the future and supported by quantum mechanics simulations and calculation of energetic profiles of Ami self-lactonization."]
