["2. Results", "2.1. The Effects of Different NaCl Concentrations on the Seed Germination", "The germination potential (GP), germination rate (GR), germination index (GI), vigor index (VI) and shoot length (SL) of F. tataricum seeds all decreased as the concentration of NaCl treatment increased (Table 1). VI and SL decreased significantly under 50 mmol L\u22121 NaCl compared to those under 0 mmol L\u22121 NaCl (p < 0.05); and GI, VI, and SL were significantly inhibited under the 100 mmol L\u22121 NaCl treatment (p < 0.05) (Table 1). However, all five germination indices further decreased under the 150 and 200 mmol L\u22121 NaCl treatments (p < 0.05) (Table 1). As the concentration of NaCl treatments was increased from 0 to 50, 100, 150 and 200 mmol L\u22121, VI decreased by 77.0%, 88.2%, 91.9%, and 95.2%, respectively; and SL decreased by 75.6%, 82.4%, 85.7%, and 89.0%, respectively (Table 1). In summary, 50 mmol L\u22121 NaCl significantly reduces GP, GR and GI, and significantly inhibits VI and SL by more than 75.0% (Table 1). Therefore, going forward, this study used 50 mmol L\u22121 NaCl solution to induce seed stress (Table 1).", "2.2. The Effects of H2O2 Pretreatment and NaCl Stress on the Seed Germination", "The 50 mmol L\u22121 NaCl treatment had no significant inhibitory effect on GP, GR, and GI of F. tataricum seed (p < 0.05) (Figure 1A\u2013C); however, it did significantly reduce their VI (p < 0.05), which was 76.6% lower than the CK (Figure 1D). Under NaCl stress, treatments of increasing H2O2 concentration caused an initial increase and then a decrease in the GP, GR, GI, and VI of F. tataricum seeds (Figure 1A\u2013D). The GP, GR, and GI of seeds reached their maximum values under the treatment of NaCl + 5 mmol L\u22121 H2O2; increasing by 14.5%, 8.7%, and 18.4%, respectively, compared to those of seeds treated with NaCl alone (Figure 1A\u2013C). VI reached its maximum value under NaCl + 10 mmol L\u22121 H2O2, which was 3.1 times higher than that under NaCl treatment alone (Figure 1D). Under the treatment of NaCl + 100 mmol L\u22121 H2O2, the GP, GR, GI, and VI all noticeably decreased compared to their values under the CK treatment, and NaCl alone (Figure 1A\u2013D). These results suggest that pretreatment with H2O2 could alleviate the inhibitory effects that F. tataricum seeds experience under salt stress.", "2.3. The Effects of H2O2 Pretreatment and NaCl Stress on Shoot Length and Fresh Weight", "Compared with the measurements in the CK treatment, shoot length (SL) and shoot fresh weight (SFW) decreased significantly under all other treatments (p < 0.05) (Figure 2A,B). In the NaCl treatment, SL and SFW of F. tataricum seedlings reduced significantly to 25.5% and 48.2% of the control values, respectively (Figure 2A,B). Excluding the control treatment, SL and SFW first increased and then decreased with increasing H2O2 concentration, reaching their highest values at 0.5\u201310 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 (Figure 2A,B). Under the 10 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment, SL was 2.8 times higher than that of the NaCl treatment (Figure 2A); while SFW was 1.6 times higher (Figure 2B). However, they both reached their lowest values under the 100 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment (Figure 2A,B).", "2.4. The Effects of H2O2 Pretreatment and NaCl Stress on Root Growth", "The NaCl treatment had a significant effect on the root growth of F. tataricum seedlings compared to that of the control treatment (Table 2). Root length (RL) and Root surface area (RSA) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) by 36.3% and 38.9%, respectively (Table 2); Root average diameter (RAD) and Root volume (RV) were significantly reduced by 4.1% and 35.7%, respectively (Table 2); whereas root fresh weight (RFW) increased significantly by 35.7% (Table 2). Excluding the control treatment, RL, RSA, RAD, RV, and RFW all increased and then decreased as H2O2 concentration increased (Table 2). Under the NaCl + 0.5 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment, RL, RSA, and RFW reached their maximum values at 1.6, 1.9, and 1.4 times higher than those in the NaCl treatment (Table 2). RAD and RV reached their maximum values under the NaCl + 10 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment, which were 7.3 and 3.4 times those of the NaCl treatment, respectively (Table 2). The RSA of F. tataricum seedlings decreased significantly at H2O2 concentrations of 5\u2013100 mmol L\u22121, while the RAD increased significantly (Table 2). These results suggest that pretreatment with H2O2 can generally alleviate NaCl\u2019s inhibitory effect on the root growth of F. tataricum seedlings; however, its effect on RSA was certainly different.", "2.5. The Effects of H2O2 Pretreatment and NaCl Stress on Antioxidant Enzyme Activity", "Excluding the CK treatment, CAT and SOD first increased and then decreased in response to increasing H2O2 concentrations; whereas POD first decreased and then increased (Figure 3A\u2013C). Under the NaCl + 10 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment, the activity of CAT and SOD in F. tataricum seedlings reached maximums at 196.6 and 1.7 U g\u22121, respectively (Figure 3A,B). POD activity reached its minimum of 1177.0 U g\u22121 under the treatment of NaCl + 5 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 (Figure 3C).", "The SOD and POD activities increased significantly under NaCl stress in F. tataricum seedlings (p < 0.05) (Figure 3B, C). SOD activity increased significantly in all treatments when compared to that of the control; specifically, by 47.8% in the NaCl + 10 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment (Figure 3B). POD activity in most treatments was higher than in the control, except for that of the NaCl + 5 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 and NaCl + 10 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatments (Figure 3C).", "The CAT activity was significantly inhibited in F. tataricum seedlings under NaCl stress (p < 0.05) (Figure 3A). At low (0.1\u20130.5 mmol L\u22121) and high (50\u2013100 mmol L\u22121) H2O2 concentrations, the CAT activity was significantly reduced (Figure 3A). It reached its lowest activity level, at 55.2% below the maximum, under the NaCl + 50 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment (Figure 3A).", "2.6. The Effects of H2O2 Pretreatment and NaCl Stress on MDA and Pro Contents", "The MDA content of F. tataricum seedlings under the NaCl-only treatment increased significantly by 16.5% (p < 0.05) compared to that of the control treatment (Figure 4A). Under the treatments of increasing H2O2 concentration, MDA content generally decreased first and then increased (Figure 4A). Its minimum value was 8.2 nmol g\u22121 under the NaCl + 20 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment, which was 68.7% of the MDA value in the NaCl treatment (Figure 4A). The MDA content increased significantly under the NaCl + 50 mmol L\u22121 and NaCl + 100 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatments, indicating that H2O2 pretreatment significantly reduced the effects of NaCl stress on F. tataricum seedlings (Figure 4A). These results indicate that soaking seeds in different H2O2 concentrations can have varying effects on MDA content.", "The Pro content of F. tataricum seedlings in each treatment was significantly higher than that of the control treatment (p < 0.05) (Figure 4B). It first increased and then decreased with increasing H2O2 concentration (Figure 4B); reaching its peak under the NaCl + 10 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment which was 2.7 and 1.4 times that of the CK and NaCl treatments, respectively (Figure 4B). Thereafter, further increases in H2O2 concentration caused a significant decrease in seedling Pro content (Figure 4B); with Pro content of the NaCl + 100 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment decreasing by 23.1% compared to that of the NaCl + 10 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment (Figure 4B). These results indicate that H2O2 pretreatment increased the content of osmotic adjustment substances in F. tataricum seedlings under NaCl stress to a certain extent.", "2.7. Hierarchical Clustering and Correlation Analysis", "The clustering heat map indicates that the high values of all parameters, except POD and MDA, appeared in the 0.5\u201320 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatments (Figure 5). Under NaCl stress, the growth and material accumulation of F. tataricum seedlings above and below ground were reduced (the smaller value) (Figure 5). The germination characteristics and morphological characteristics of F. tataricum seedlings above and below ground were weakened (the smaller value) by treatments of 50 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 or higher. All the salt tolerance indices, except POD, MDA, and Pro, were reduced (the smaller value) under the NaCl + 100 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatment (Figure 5). The maximum values of the above parameters were all reflected in seedlings in the CK, NaCl + 5 mmol L\u22121 H2O2, and NaCl + 10 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 treatments (Figure 5).", "Correlation analysis indicates whether there is any dependency between the parameters; furthermore, it reveals the strength of the relationship, if any. As shown in Figure 6, SL, VI, and SFW shared a strong, positive correlation (p < 0.01). The strongest correlation was between SL and SFW (r = 0.997; p < 0.01) (Figure 6). GI was positively correlated with SL, VI, and SFW (p < 0.05) (Figure 6); GR shared a strong, positive correlation with GP, CAT, RV, and RL (p < 0.01) (Figure 6); and the maximum correlation coefficient was 0.964 (Figure 6). GP shared a strong, positive correlation with CAT and RV (p < 0.01); as well as RL (p < 0.05) (Figure 6). MDA and POD were negatively correlated with most indices, while they were positively correlated with one another (r = 0.492) (Figure 6). Through the cluster analysis and correlation analysis, the results of the two were consistent (Figure 5 and Figure 6).", "2.8. Screening Biological Indicators of the H2O2 Pretreatment and NaCl Stress", "2.8.1. Principal Component Analysis", "The Origin 2019b Software was used to conduct a principal component analysis (PCA) of the 16 single indices of F. tataricum germination and salt tolerance. The eigenvalues of the first three components (PC1, PC2, PC3) were 8.625, 3.795, and 1.726, respectively (Table 3). Their contribution rates were 53.905%, 23.716%, and 10.790%, respectively, and their cumulative contribution was 88.411% (Table 3). As such, PC1, PC2, and PC3 accurately represent all the data contained in the original 16 indices (Table 3).", "The eigenvector matrix reflects the load of each index on each principal component. In PC1, GP, CAT, RL, SFW, GR, RV, VI, SL and GI had higher loads and were the main factors of this principal component (Table 3). Thus, PC1 mainly represented the germination characteristics, morphological characteristics, and material synthesis and accumulation of F. tataricum seeds (Table 3). In PC2, Pro and SOD were the main factors and had relatively large loads of 0.962 and 0.942, respectively (Table 3). Thus, PC2 mainly represented the antioxidant enzyme activity and osmotic adjustment substances of the seedlings (Table 3). RSA and RAD were the main factors of PC3, indicating that this principle component mainly represented the morphological characteristics and material synthesis and accumulation of the seedlings underground. As such, GP, CAT, RL, SFW, GR, RV, VI, SL, and GI were used as first-level indicators for evaluating salt tolerance of F. tataricum seeds treated with different concentrations of H2O2; Pro and SOD were used as second-level indicators; RSA and RAD were used as third level indicators (Table 3). In summary, 13 indices could be used as comprehensive indicators for evaluating the effects of pretreatment with different H2O2 concentrations on the germination of F. tataricum seeds under NaCl stress (Table 3).", "2.8.2. Stepwise Regression Analysis", "A mathematical model for the evaluation of salt tolerance was established through stepwise regression. The comprehensive evaluation D value was the dependent variable, and each index value was used as an independent variable in the stepwise regression analysis. The optimal regression equation was set up with the coefficient of determination R2 = 1.000, and variance F = 118,710.98.\nY = \u22120.008X1 + 0.241X2 + 0.062X3 + 0.034X4 + 0.048X5 \u2212 0.058X6 + 0.327,\nwhere Y is the predicted comprehensive evaluation value of F. tataricum seeds under salt stress with different H2O2 pretreatment concentrations; X1\u2013X6 represent GP, SFW, RSA, RAD, CAT, and SOD, respectively. The correlation coefficient R = 1.000 (P = 0.002) between the predicted salt tolerance value, Y, and the salt tolerance evaluation value, D, of F. tataricum seeds, indicates that this equation is accurate and has a high predictive capability. Furthermore, it indicates that the indices used are key to evaluating the influence of different H2O2 concentrations on F. tataricum seeds under NaCl stress."]
