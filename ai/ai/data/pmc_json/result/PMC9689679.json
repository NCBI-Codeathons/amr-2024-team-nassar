["3. Results", "Our screening of publicly available genomic records revealed the presence of vanHAXRS and related genes in four classes of Gram-positive bacteria beyond the phylum Actinobacteria, i.e., Bacilli, Clostridia, Erysipelotrichia, and Ktedonobacteria, as well as in one class of Gram-negative bacteria\u2014Anaerolineae (Table 1)\u2014all belonging to the Terrabacteria superphylum [71]. To our best knowledge, van genes have not been previously reported in representatives of the last three classes. Notably, we did not include van loci found in MAGs in this analysis. For example, at least one MAG containing van loci was also found in the classes Acidobacteria, Fusobacteria, Negativicutes, and Thermotogae. However, the analysis of genes up- and downstream of these van loci showed them to be identical or homologous to genes from different Actinobacteria spp. (namely, micrococci). This allowed us to reasonably suspect anomalies in the MAG assembly, presuming that the final genome reconstruction was \u201ccontaminated\u201d with nucleic acid sequences from other bacteria.", "In the following subsections, the organization and genetic background of vanHAXRS for each taxonomical class is further investigated.", "3.1. van Genes in Class Anaerolineae", "A single set of van genes was discovered in one of the species from a still poorly investigated class of Gram-negative bacteria\u2014Anaerolineae [53]. Here, the organization of van genes in Al. lenta MO-CFX2 SCF03 (vanRSWHAX, Figure 1a, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cAnaerolineae\u201d worksheet) resembled the one described in the Ecc. faecalis BM4382 pIP834+ plasmid-borne Tn1549 transposon, although it lacked vanY homolog. In addition, a set of genes coding for putative transposases, recombinases, and integrases was found near the van locus (see Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cAnaerolineae MGERG\u201d). However, none of them showed significant similarity to the counterparts from previously published MGEs carrying van genes (summarized in ESM Table S1).", "3.2. van Genes in Class Erysipelotrichia", "Most studied representatives of the class Erysipelotrichia belong to the gut microbiota, while the class itself was recently delineated as a sister taxon of the Clostridia class within the phylum Firmicutes [72]. Our screen indicated the presence of van genes in the genomes of Lct. caecimuris 3BBH23 (isolated from healthy human feces [73]) and of unclassified clinical Erysipelotrichaceae isolate 66202529 (CP046174, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cErysipelotrichia\u201d). Both vanRS and vanHAX operons were found in Lct. caecimuris 3BBH23, with a gene coding for a VanYD DacC-like carboxypeptidase [74] in between (Figure 1b). The chromosome of Erysipelotrichaceae isolate 66202529 carried a set of vanRSYWHAX genes (Figure 1b), like in the Ecc. faecium MLG229 Tn1549-like transposon. In both Lct. caecimuris 3BBH23 and isolate 66202529, we found a pair of genes coding for excisionase and a tyrosine-based site-specific integrase downstream of van loci (Figure 1b), as well as multiple other MGE-related genes (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cErysipelotrichia\u201d). Peculiarly, the integrase coded downstream of van loci in Lct. caecimuris 3BBH23 lacked any significant similarity to homologs in previously published MGEs carrying van genes (summarized in ESM Table S1). Thus, van loci in Lct. caecimuris 3BBH23 are likely to be a part of a novel MGE. On the contrary, the integrase from isolate 66202529 appeared to share 100% aa sequence identity with the integrases found downstream of van loci in Ecc. faecium MLG229 and Clostridium sp. MLG245 Tn1549-like transposons, implying that isolate 66202529 carries the latter MGE.", "3.3. Peculiarities of Organization and Genetic Context of van Genes in Class Ktedonobacteria", "For the first time, our screen revealed that van genes are present in representatives of the class Ktedonobacteria (phylum Chloroflexi) (Table 1, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cKtedonobacteria\u201d). These enigmatic organisms belong to an unusual group of filamentous Gram-positive soil dwellers. Ktedonobacteria spp. resemble filamentous sporulating actinomycetes in certain aspects of morphology and lifestyle [55,75], implying that a sophisticated machinery for cell-wall rearrangement might exist there.", "The arrangements and genetic contexts of van genes in Ktedonobacteria spp. were unprecedented: in all of them, we observed a tendency to lose vanX (Figure 1c, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cKtedonobacteria\u201d). However, this loss was correlated with the gain of a novel gene pair positioned between vanRS and vanHA (Figure 1c). Remarkably, these two genes were found to code for peptidases. One peptidase belonged to the MEROPS [76] M15B subfamily of metallopeptidases, while the second resembled peptidases of the MEROPS C39 family. Typical VanX proteins also belong to the M15B subfamily but are quite different from M15B metallopeptidases from the Ktedonobacteria spp. mentioned above. VanX from S. coelicolor A3(2) (taken as a reference) shares only ca. 15% aa sequence identity with any of the Ktedonobacteria spp. M15B metallopeptidases, and it is shorter (202 aa vs. ca. > 320 aa). Moreover, Kb. racemifer DSM 44963 contained an additional gene coding for a MEROPS M19 family dipeptidase just after vanA (thus directly replacing the canonical position of vanX, Figure 1c). Other relevant genes were co-localized with van loci in Ktedonobacteria spp., including genes for MurF (a UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide ligase), a GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT), a VanYD-like DacC d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase, and a d-Ala-d-Ala ligase (Figure 1c, Supplementary Excel File S1). Another interesting feature was observed in Ktedonobacter sp. SOSP1-52, where vanH and vanA were fused (Figure 1c); however, it remains unknown whether the fusion protein is produced or whether what we observed is just an error of genome sequencing and annotation.", "Further analysis of the close genomic neighborhood of van loci in Ktedonobacteria spp. (except Db. alpinus Uno16) revealed a striking number of genes coding for transposases (often incomplete or frameshifted, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cKtedonobacteria MGERG\u201d) belonging to different insertion sequence (IS) families. Most of them had DDE catalytic residues [77]. In addition, we discovered multiple short and long inverted repeats. Genes coding for recombinase/integrase-like enzymes were also found (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cKtedonobacteria MGERG\u201d), although they did not show repetitive patterns across different Ktedonobacteria spp.", "To study the last aspect more comprehensively, we created a detailed map of the genomic neighborhood of van loci in Kb. racemifer DSM 44963 (given in Figure 2). The examined region (ca. 50 kbp up- and downstream of van loci) contained 21 genes for transposases (4 of them were pseudogenes), 2 genes for integrase-like enzymes, and one gene for a restriction endonuclease. Three segments surrounded by large inverted repeat regions were found upstream of the van loci (Figure 2): in two cases, these inverted repeats were duplicated genes for transposases, while the third case involved the duplication and inversion of the vanRS locus. Moreover, two intact ISKra4-like IS elements and one ISKra7-like IS element were found up- and downstream of the van loci, respectively. Another putative IS element composed of a gene for an IS1380-family transposase with 36 bp inverted repeats was found downstream of van loci; however, neither the transposase nor the repeat regions were significantly similar to any entries of the ISfinder database [63]. Finally, two peptidase genes (M15B and C39, see above) might also belong to an unknown IS element in Kb. racemifer DSM 44963. Both genes were co-localized with an IS200/IS605-family transposase gene and flanked with 58 bp inverted repeats (Figure 2). Interestingly, the same inverted repeats were found flanking M15B- and C39-peptidase genes in other Ktedonobacteria spp., although the IS200/IS605-family transposase gene was present only in Kb. racemifer DSM 44963.", "3.4. Updates on vanHAXRS Gene Distribution in Bacilli Class", "Bacteria belonging to the Bacilli class are well known to carry vanHAXRS genes; these are either opportunistic pathogens such as staphylococci and enterococci or non-harmful soil dwellers (see summary in ESM Table S1). Since our previous bioinformatic analysis [25], multiple novel genomic records for Bacilli spp. have become available in GenBank and RefSeq. This allowed us to significantly update the picture of the vanHAXRS distribution in the Bacilli class: vanHAXRS genes were discovered in 48 novel strains from this class (Table 1, Supplementary Excel File S1\u201cBacilli\u201d).", "The arrangements of van genes varied across different strains and are summarized in Figure 3. The simplest one\u2014only vanHAX genes with no MGE-related genes nearby\u2014was discovered in Pba. dendritiformis J6TS7 (Figure 3a, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli\u201d). An additional vanS pseudogene was present in Pba. flagellatus DXL2 (Figure 3b, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli\u201d); however, vanS was found at the 5\u2032-end of the available contig, suggesting that it could be intact and likely followed by a vanR gene. No adjacent MGE-related genes were discovered in Pba. flagellatus DXL2, either. The van genes in Brevibacillus sp. SKDU10 also lacked the vanRS locus, and they were arranged as vanHAXYZ. A vanH pseudogene, another copy of vanZ, and a transposase pseudogene (Figure 3c, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli\u201d, \u201cBacilli MGERG\u201d) were discovered further downstream.", "A set of five Pba. macerans strains, together with Pba. oralis KCOM 3021 (Figure 3d), carried vanRSHAX genes with a highly conserved gene for a tyrosine-type site-specific recombinase lying downstream. This recombinase did not share any similarity with the recombinases already reported to be co-localized with van loci. Some other MGE-related genes were also discovered up- and downstream of van loci in these six strains, although they were not strictly conserved (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli MGERG\u201d). Furthermore, van genes were organized as vanRSHAX in eight additional strains (Figure 3e\u2013i, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli\u201d). In addition, van loci were co-localized with transposase genes in Paenibacillus sp. SM 69 and Pba. zanthoxyli JH29 and with a gene for an unprecedented tyrosine-type site-specific recombinase in Paenibacillus sp. cl123 and Paenibacillus sp. UNCCL117 (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli MGERG\u201d). Notably, in Paenibacillus sp. SM 69, Pba. elgii MER 157, and Pba. mesophilus SYSU K30004, a gene for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramyl-(pentapeptide) pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol N-acetylglucosamine transferase (MurG) was found downstream of van loci (Figure 3e,i). A slightly different arrangement\u2014vanRSWHAX\u2014was observed in three other Paenibacillus spp. (Figure 3j). Here, no MGE-related genes were discovered nearby, but a gene for MurG was again found downstream of van loci (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli\u201d).", "In Paenibacillus sp. YIM B00624, van genes were organized as vanZRSHAX (Figure 3k), again with no MGE-related genes nearby, but followed by a gene for MurG (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli\u201d).", "Only two strains, namely, Alic. shizuokensis NBRC 103103 and Paenibacillus sp. YIM B00362, were found to carry a gene for a DacC-like VanYD carboxypeptidase within van loci, organized as vanRS(W pseudogene)HAX(YD) and vanRSHAX(YD), respectively (Figure 3l,m). In Alic. shizuokensis NBRC 103103, van loci were surrounded by two transposase pseudogenes, while Paenibacillus sp. YIM B00362 had no MGE-related genes near van loci (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli MGERG\u201d). As in some of the other abovementioned Paenibacillus spp., Paenibacillus sp. YIM B00362 had a gene for MurG just downstream of van genes (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli\u201d).", "Next, in Anox. sediminis PCH 117, Brevibacillus sp. MCWH, and Brevibacillus sp. NL20B1 van genes were organized as vanRSHAXY (Figure 3n). No MGE-related genes were found to co-localize with van genes in these three strains. One additional gene\u2014vanZ\u2014was found downstream of vanRSHAXY in Bba. laterosporus B9, Pba. thiaminolyticus BO5, and W. ginsengihumi Gsoil 114 (Figure 3o). Notably, in Bba. laterosporus B9, van loci were carried on a plasmid. Another group of four Brevibacillus spp. had a similar arrangement of van genes: vanRSHAX and vanYZ loci separated by a non-correlated gene (Figure 3p), also sharing a transposase pseudogene just upstream of vanR (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli MGERG\u201d).", "Pba. physcomitrellae CGMCC 1.15044 and Pba. physcomitrellae XB represented a rather unique case among Bacilli spp., where van genes were organized as vanRSZYHAX, and a set of three MGE-related genes was found upstream (Figure 3q). These three genes code for an ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecG, a CRI phage replication protein, and an unprecedented serine-type recombinase (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli MGERG\u201d). The RecG and recombinase proteins shared high similarity with counterparts in the genomes of phages of the order Caudovirales [78].", "Three distinct combinations of vanH, A, X, R, S, and Z genes were observed in the following strains: vanHAXRSZ in Thermoactinomyces sp. CICC 10735 (Figure 3r); vanRSHAXZ in Nba. jeddahensis MGYG-HGUT-01469, Nba. jeddahensis JCE, and Bacillus sp. JCA (Figure 3s); and vanRSZHAX in Pba. sonchi X19-5, Pba. sonchi IIRRBNF1, and Pba. jilunlii DSM 23019 (Figure 3t). In Thermoactinomyces sp. CICC 10735, Nba. jeddahensis MGYG-HGUT-01469, Nba. jeddahensis JCE, Pba. sonchi X19-5, and Pba. jilunlii DSM 23019, van loci were not accompanied by MGE-related genes, while the genomic neighborhood of van genes in Pba. sonchi IIRRBNF1 and Bacillus sp. JCA was enriched with genes and pseudogenes for transposases of different types (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli MGERG\u201d). In Pba. sonchi X19-5, Pba. sonchi IIRRBNF1, and Pba. jilunlii DSM 23019, a gene coding for an N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate etherase (MurQ) was found just downstream of vanX.", "Finally, the vanRSZYWHAX arrangement was discovered in Pba. nasutitermitis CGMCC 1.15178, Pba. apiarius MW-14, Bba. halotolerans J5TS2, Alkalihalobacillus sp. EGI L200015, and Bba. laterosporus SAM19 (Figure 3u). In each of these strains, van loci were accompanied by variable sets of genes and pseudogenes for transposases of different types (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cBacilli MGERG\u201d). Notably, a gene for an unprecedented tyrosine-type site-specific integrase was found downstream of van loci in Pba.\napiarius MW-14.", "3.5. Updating the Picture of vanHAXRS Gene Distribution in Clostridia Class", "To date, at least two Clostridia spp. carrying vanHAX and vanRS loci as a part of a Tn1549-like transposon have been reported (ESM Table S1). Bizarrely recombined van loci lacking vanH orthologs were also discovered in different strains of Dsf. hafniense [52] (ESM Table S1). Our screen added new results to previous data: vanHAX, vanRS, and related genes were found within the genomic records of 23 strains from the Clostridia class (Table 1, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d). The arrangements of vanHAX, vanRS, and related genes were found to be quite variable.", "The simplest one\u2014the vanHAX locus only\u2014was observed in Am. terrae CBA3637 and Bl. producta ER3 (Figure 4a, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d). Additionally, in Am. terrae CBA3637, genes for UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamate-2,6-diaminopimelate ligase (MurE) and a serine-based recombinase were found upstream of vanHAX (Figure 4a, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d and \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d). This recombinase did not share any similarity with other van-loci-associated recombinases published previously.", "The vanHAXRS arrangement was found in Bed. massiliensis GM1 (Figure 4b, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d), although no MGE-related genes were found nearby.", "Next, in Cli. tagluense CS002, van genes were arranged as vanHAXYRS with additional genes for MurE and undecaprenyl-diphosphate phosphatase downstream, and no MGE-related genes were found nearby (Figure 4c, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d).", "The vanRSHAX arrangement was observed in Cuneatibacter sp. NSJ-177, with an upstream gene coding for a tyrosine-based site-specific recombinase/integrase (Figure 4d, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d and \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d). Again, this recombinase shared no similarity to the previously reported ones associated with van loci.", "Cli. argentinense 113/29 exhibited the vanRSHAXYZ arrangement of van genes, with no MGE-related genes nearby (Figure 4e, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d).", "In An. chartisolvens DSM 27016, we found the vanRS locus, followed by vanK, vanYD (coding for a DacC-like carboxypeptidase), and vanHAX (Figure 4f, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d); the van genes were surrounded by genes coding for a RecG-like DNA helicase and a restriction endonuclease. Finally, a gene coding for a serine-based recombinase was found downstream of van loci; as in the cases above, this recombinase shared no similarity with previously published van-loci-associated recombinases (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d).", "A vanRS(YD)HAX arrangement was found within the genomic records of several Clostridia spp. The first group of them included Lachnospiraceae bacterium M18-1, Rcc.\ngauvreauii DSM 19829, Rcc. gauvreauii MGYG-HGUT-01690, [Clostridium] scindens MSK.5.24, Bar. massiliensis DFI.1.181, and Ext. muris DSM 28560 (Figure 4g, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d). All six of these bacterial strains shared a common gene for an unknown highly conserved tyrosine-based site-specific recombinase/integrase just after vanX. In addition, the genomic neighborhood of van loci in Lachnospiraceae bacterium M18-1 and Ext. muris DSM 28560 contained a rich repertoire of putative MGE-related genes (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d). Although many of them were homologous to genes found in phages from the order Caudovirales [78], neither Phaster nor PhisDetector tools were able to identify prophage regions near van loci in M18-1 and Ext. muris DSM 28560.", "The same arrangement of van genes was observed in Bl. pseudococcoides SCSK and Blautia sp. NBRC 113351 (Figure 4h,i). In the first strain, an additional vanZ gene was found downstream of the main van loci (Figure 4h, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d), as well as a gene for an unprecedented serine-based recombinase (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d). At the same time, a gene for an IS110-family transposase was downstream of van loci in Blautia sp. NBRC 113351 (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d). A peculiar case was observed for Rba. lactatiformans 668, where the vanRS(YD)HAX arrangement was interrupted by the insertion of ten genes into the open reading frame (ORF) of vanX (Figure 4j, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d). Two of these genes code for a MobM-like relaxase and a serine-based recombinase, respectively (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d); neither of them was similar to the MGE-related genes found before in association with van loci. Finally, the vanRS(YD)HAX arrangement was also found in Lachnotalea sp. AF33-28 and [Clostridium] symbiosum MSK.7.21 (Figure 4k,l). The genetic context of van loci in both of these strains was quite interesting. Multiple genes coding for MGE-related proteins were found upstream of van loci in Lachnotalea sp. AF33-28 (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d). All of these proteins lacked counterparts in previously published MGEs carrying van genes but appeared similar (\u226556% aa sequence identity) to proteins encoded in genomes of phages from the Caudovirales order [78]. When prophage identification analysis was performed on Lachnotalea sp. AF33-28 using Phaster, an incomplete prophage region was indeed identified upstream of van loci. The most similar phage for this region was identified as Faecalibacterium phage FP_Brigit (NC_047909). A similar situation was observed in [Clostridium] symbiosum MSK.7.21 (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d). However, neither Phaster nor PhisDetector prophage detection tools were able to discover prophages near van loci in [Clostridium] symbiosum MSK.7.21.", "Another arrangement\u2014vanRSYWHAX\u2014was discovered in [Clostridium] indolis DSM 755, [Clostridium] methoxybenzovorans SR3 (Figure 4m, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d), and Candidatus Formimonas warabiya DCMF (Figure 4n). Notably, in [Clostridium] methoxybenzovorans SR3, the vanY ORF was interrupted by a transposase pseudogene, while in Candidatus Formimonas warabiya DCMF, the vanW ORF contained a six-gene insertion. An IS1634-family transposase gene was also found upstream of van loci in the latter strain (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d).", "Ox. pfennigii DSM 3222 carried a vanRSZHAX(YD)W arrangement (Figure 4o), with no MGE-related genes nearby.", "Finally, a vanRSZYWHAX arrangement was observed in Clostridium sp. M3/9, with vanZ and vanY genes containing mutations that interrupt ORFs (Figure 4p, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia\u201d). A set of pseudo- and functional genes for transposases was found up- and downstream of van loci (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d).", "3.6. Building a Consensus Scheme for Phylogenetic Relations between Newly Discovered van Proteins and Those from Phylum Actinobacteria", "Thus, our screen revealed multiple novel van genes from representatives of five bacterial classes. To integrate this information, we further aimed to fulfill two goals: (a) create a reliable phylogenetic tree representing the evolutionary interrelationships among Van proteins encoded by different bacterial classes; (b) see whether the genetic context of van genes (i.e., co-localized MGE-related genes) correlates with their phylogeny.", "To achieve these goals, we first reconstructed separate phylogenies for VanH and VanA (i) encoded within the genomes of Actinobacteria spp. (using datasets from our previous work [25]), (ii) from nucleic acid sequences of pathogens and non-harmful soil bacteria published before (see ESM Table S1), and (iii) discovered in the current work. Separate phylogenetic reconstructions for the two proteins were coherent (see ESM Figures S1 and S2), allowing us to reasonably assume that vanHA (and corresponding proteins) evolved as a single unit (with insignificant exceptions). We moved onward to the creation of a representative phylogenetic tree using concatenated sequences of VanH and VanA proteins, encoded in a single locus. Unfortunately, we could not also use VanX sequences, since all of the representatives of the Ktedonobacteria class lack the corresponding genes (see Section 3.3). Sequences from Dsf. hafniense strains were also not included, since corresponding van loci lack vanH orthologs [52].", "The final tree is shown in Figure 5. An analysis of its topology allowed us to make some important observations. At first glance, a very recent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event involving van genes from Actinobacteria seemed evident: VanHA sequences from all Ktedonobacteria spp. and from some Clostridia spp. (namely, An. chartisolvens DSM 27016, Cli. tagluense CS002, Ox. pfennigii DSM 3222, and Candidatus Formimonas warabiya DCMF) rooted deep in the core Actinobacteria clade (further referred to as \u201cCore Actinobacteria\u201d) (Figure 5), being a sister clade to VanHA from Stackebrandtia nassauensis DSM 44728. Notably, VanA sequences from Dsf. hafniense strains also belonged to an analogous clade of the VanA tree (ESM Figure S2). The repertoire of MGE-related genes co-localized with van loci in all of these species was variable, hindering the comprehension of transmission vectors (Figure 5, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d and \u201cKtedonobacteria MGERG\u201d). However, in Ktedonobacteria spp., multiple IS transposase genes were co-localized with van loci, as well as with seemingly intact IS elements (Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cKtedonobacteria MGERG\u201d).", "In addition to the \u201cCore Actinobacteria\u201d, five major clades were defined within the tree. Clade (I) (Figure 5) appeared to be a sister clade of the \u201cCore Actinobacteria\u201d. It consisted of sequences from 12 strains of Paenibacillus, Tba. xylanilyticus XE (all 13 belonging to the class Bacilli), and Am. terrae CBA3637 (class Clostridia)\u2014the last one being a basal taxon of clade (I). In all of these species, MGE-related genes co-localized with van loci were quite different (Figure 5, Supplementary Excel File S1 \u201cClostridia MGERG\u201d and \u201cBacilli MGERG\u201d). Clade (II) was composed of VanHA sequences mainly from Bacilli spp. These were six strains of the genus Paenibacillus, four strains of Brevibacillus, Thermoactinomyces sp. CICC 10735, two strains of the genus Clostridium, and Al. lenta MO-CFX2 (class Anaerolineae) (Figure 5). VanHA sequences from Pba. physcomitrellae strains formed the basal branch of clade (II). Again, here, we did not observe any reproducible pattern of MGE-related genes co-localized with van loci (Figure 5, Supplementary Excel File S1). Notably, it appeared that one of the clade (II) species, namely, Bba. laterosporus B9, carries van loci on a plasmid. Unfortunately, the quality of genome assemblies of another clade (II) species did not allow us to understand whether they carry van loci on plasmids as well.", "VanHA sequences from Clostridia spp. (with the single exception of Lct. caecimuris 3BBH23, class Erysipelotrichia) formed clade (III) (Figure 5). The basal taxon of clade (III) was Lachnotalea sp. AF33-28. In contrast to clade (II), we observed a certain similarity in the repertoire of MGE-related genes co-localized with van loci in strains forming clade (III) (Figure 5). In some of the strains, most notably in Lachnotalea sp. AF33-28, [Clostridium] symbiosum MSK.7.21, Lachnospiraceae bacterium M18-1, and Ext. muris DSM 28560, large assemblages of putative MGE-related genes were associated with van loci (see Section 3.5). These assemblages resembled prophages, although an incomplete prophage region was identified only in Lachnotalea sp. AF33-28.", "The last two clades\u2014(IV) and (V)\u2014deserve special attention. Clade (IV) was composed of VanHA sequences from [Clostridium] methoxybenzovorans SR3, [Clostridium] indolis DSM 755, Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 66202529 (class Erysipelotrichia), and a set of strains known to carry van loci as a part of Tn1549-like transposons, namely, Atopobium (Atpb.) minutum 10063974 (phylum Actinobacteria), Clostridium sp. MLG245, Cld. difficile AI0499, Ecc. faecium E525, Ecc. faecium RBWH1, Ecc. faecium MLG229, Ecc. faecalis BM4382, and Ecc. faecium E155 (see ESM Table S1 for references) (Figure 5). While Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 66202529 clearly carried genes from the Tn1549-like transposon near van loci (see Section 3.2), no MGE-related genes were discovered near van loci in [Clostridium] methoxybenzovorans SR3 and [Clostridium] indolis DSM 755.", "Clade (V) included a large portion of VanHA sequences from different Bacilli spp.; the repertoire of MGE-related genes co-localized with van loci was rather poor in species belonging to this clade (Figure 5). Finally, a subclade of clade (V)\u2014(V\u2019)\u2014appeared to be composed of VanHA sequences from plasmids carrying Tn1546-like transposons, isolated from clinically relevant enterococci and staphylococci from all over the world (Figure 5, see also ESM Table S1 for references). Bacillus circulans VR0709 was a basal taxon of (V\u2019) (Figure 5), where a single MGE-related gene was found adjacent to the van loci [50,79]. This was a gene for an IS200/IS605-family (Y1) transposase (CAB61226) that had no homologs in other clade (V\u2019) strains. Peculiarly, Ecc. faecium RBWH1 pRBWH1.3+ [32] appeared to carry two sets of van genes simultaneously: one as a part of the Tn1546-like transposon on the plasmid (pRBWH1.3), and another as a part of the Tn1549-like transposon integrated into the chromosome.", "Concluding the analysis of the tree, it seems interesting to note that VanHA sequences encoded in putative MGEs from two actinobacteria\u2014Parvibacter (Prv.) caecicola DSM 22242 and Enterorhabdus (Enr.) mucosicola NM66_B29\u2014formed the basal branch of the whole tree (Figure 5)."]
