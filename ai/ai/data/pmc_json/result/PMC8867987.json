The genome of B. brevis X23 was sequenced on the PacBio sequencing platform and submitted to NCBI (accession number: NZ_CP023474.1) (Chen et\u00a0al., 2012). Based on antiSMASH (Blin et\u00a0al., 2017) and Big\u2010SCAPE (Navarro\u2010Mu\u00f1oz et\u00a0al., 2020) analyses, 12 potential secondary metabolite BGCs were identified, one of which showed high sequence similarity to the predicted ede BGC of B. brevis Vm4 reported by Westman et\u00a0al., (2013) (Fig.\u20092A). The identified ede BGC in B. brevis X23 shared the same organization as that in the B. brevis Vm4 genome. Briefly, the ede BGC (45.1\u2009kb) in B. brevis X23 consisted of 17 open reading frames, designated edeA to edeQ according to the homologous sequences in B. brevis Vm4 (Fig.\u20092A).", "Fig. 2Antimicrobial activity and HPLC\u2010MS analysis of X23\u2010WT and X23\u0394ede strains.A.

To confirm whether the predicted ede BGC was responsible for the biosynthesis of edeines, we knocked out the promoter region and the starter module edeP (RS18545) of the ede operon to generate the mutant strain B. brevis X23\u0394ede (Fig.\u20092B and C). Then, both the wild\u2010type X23 (X23\u2010WT) and mutant strains were subjected to antimicrobial activity and comparative metabolomic analyses. The X23\u2010WT strain exhibited considerable antimicrobial activities against Ralstonia solanacearum and B. subtilis in the plate assay. However, the X23\u0394ede culture supernatant had completely lost antimicrobial ability against R. solanacearum (Fig.\u20092D\u20101) and B. subtilis (Fig.\u20092D\u20102). High\u2010performance liquid chromatography\u2010mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2010MS) analysis demonstrated abolished production of edeines A and B in the crude extract of the supernatant of X23\u0394ede culture compared with X23\u2010WT (Fig.\u20092E and F). Taken together, these results suggested that the identified ede BGC was responsible for the production of antibiotic edeines A and B in B. brevis X23.", "Construction of promoter\u2010engineered B. brevis X23 strains", "The present study showed that all the edeine biosynthetic genes in B. brevis Vm4 (edeA\u2010edeP) were present on the same ede operon, which shared a single promoter, Pede (Fig.\u20093). Therefore, we hypothesized that it would be possible to improve the expression of the edeine BGC by replacing the original promoter Pede with stronger promoters. Thus, six strong promoters that are commonly used in B. brevis and B. subtilis, including three constitutive promoters (Pshuttle\u201009 (Yang et\u00a0al., 2013), P43 (Ye et\u00a0al., 1999) and Pmwp (Mizukami et\u00a0al., 2010)) and three inducer\u2010free promoters from inducible promoters (PxylA (Kim et\u00a0al., 1996), Pgrac (Phan et\u00a0al., 2006) and Pspc (Yansura and Henner, 1984)) generated by removing the repressor protein component, were selected to replace the original Pede promoter to improve edeine production (Tables S2 and S3). By double\u2010crossover homologous recombination via temperature\u2010sensitive integration vectors (Fig.\u00a0S1) carrying the homologous regions from upstream and downstream of the Pede region of X23\u2010WT, the original promoter Pede was replaced with either one of the abovementioned six promoters (Fig.\u20093). The transformants were first identified by PCR (Fig.\u00a0S2) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The transformants were designated X23 (Pede::Pmwp), X23 (Pede::PxylA), X23 (Pede::P43), X23 (Pede::Pshuttle\u201009), X23 (Pede::Pgrac) and X23 (Pede::Pspc).", "Fig. 3Schematic diagram of promoter engineering of the ede BGC in X23\u2010WT.

However, the cell turbidity (OD600) of the six promoter\u2010engineered strains was 7.5\u201315.3% lower than that of the X23\u2010WT at 36 and 48\u2009h (decline phase) (Fig.\u20094B), suggesting that the promoter substitution affected both the growth and biomass of B. brevis X23.

Thus, the yield of edeines was roughly consistent with the antimicrobial activity of B. brevis X23. Although edeines have broad inhibitory activity against Gram\u2010positive and Gram\u2010negative bacteria, B. subtilis was chosen to evaluate the antibacterial activity of all B. brevis strains because it exhibited the highest sensitivity to edeines based on our previous results (Lu, 2014). Therefore, to evaluate the effects of promoter substitutions on the yield of edeines, we first performed plate inhibition assay to assess the antibacterial activity of X23\u2010WT and six promoter\u2010engineered strains against B. subtilis 168 after 6, 9, 12, 24, 36 and 48\u2010h incubations.

After 48\u2009h of incubation, the radii of the inhibitory zones of X23(Pede::Pmwp), X23(Pede::Pgrac), X23(Pede::Pshuttle\u201009), X23(Pede::Pspc), X23(Pede::PxylA) and X23(Pede::P43) were increased by 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2, 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2, 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2, 1.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1, 1.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 and 0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2010fold, respectively, compared with the X23\u2010WT strain (Fig.\u20095B and C). Of note, there was no significant difference in the radius of inhibition zone between the promoter\u2010engineered X23(Pede::Pmwp) and X23(Pede::Pgrac) strains.

The total yield of edeines (edeine A and B) reached 83.59\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 in X23(Pede::Pmwp) (Table\u00a0S4). Given that the yield of edeine B was much lower than that of edeine A and that edeine B contains an unusual guanyl\u2010spermidine reside rather than spermidine, we speculated that the availability of the precursor guanyl\u2010spermidine might limit edeine B production."]
