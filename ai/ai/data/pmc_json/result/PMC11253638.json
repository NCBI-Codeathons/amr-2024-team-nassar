["RESULTS", "B. brevis HK544 exhibited a respiration inhibitory activity with a robust antifungal activity", "In the search for new natural resources exhibiting respiratory inhibition activity, we found that the HK544 CF (20%, vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the NFYG medium but not in the YG medium, which was similar to the strobilurin fungicide kresoxim-methyl that has a role as a mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex inhibitor (see Fig. S1). At various concentrations, HK544 CF inhibited the growth of S. cerevisiae in the range of 55%\u201399% when they were grown in NFYG medium, whereas the growth inhibition of S. cerevisiae grown in YG medium ranged from 3% to 11% (Fig. 1A).

As a result, we observed that the HK544 strain inhibited the mycelial growth of F. graminearum based on the dual culture assay. The HK544 CF also had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.25% against F. graminearum when a conidial suspension was used (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether the HK544 CF has a respiratory inhibition activity against F. graminearum, we measured the ATP production of F. graminearum with and without HK544 CF treatment. When the mycelia were treated by 0.1% and 1% of the HK544 CF, the ATP production decreased by 21.9% and 64.5% compared to the non-treatment control after a 1 h treatment incubation, respectively. At 4 h after the treatment, the ATP production decreased by 83.5% and 100% compared to the non-treatment control (Fig. 1C). These results support the possibility that the HK544 CF is involved in the respiratory inhibition of F. graminearum.", "The HK544 strain was previously identified as a B. brevis at the genome level (20). Prior to the chemical identification of the respirator inhibitor from B. brevis HK544 CF, we analyzed and compared the secondary metabolites derived from the HK544 genome with several Brevibacillus and Bacillus species (21, 22). Based on the antiSMASH analysis, we found that B. brevis HK544 contains 17 biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs), including non-ribosomal peptide, polyketide synthases, and post-translationally modified peptide clusters, suggesting that the HK544 strain can produce various bioactive compounds such as tyrocidine and zwittermicin A (Fig. 1D). When compared with other Brevibacillus spp., the composition of HK544 BGCs was similar with other Brevibacillus spp. although the number of BGCs differed (Fig. 1D). Based on the previously reported bioactive compounds from B. brevis, limited information is available regarding the respiratory inhibitory activity of the bioactive compounds by B. brevis.", "B. brevis HK544 produced EB1 as a major active compound for respiratory inhibition", "To isolate the active compounds showing respiratory inhibition activity from the B. brevis HK544 CF, we performed chromatography analyses based on the growth comparison of S. cerevisiae in NFYG and YG media. Consequently, the active compound HKC1 (117 mg) was obtained as colorless needles from the HK544 CF. The UV/Vis spectrum of HKC1 showed an end absorbance below 210 nm. The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectrum of HKC1 showed molecular ions at m/z 797 [M+H]+ and m/z 819 [M+Na]+. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data of HKC1 (see Table S1) wholly agreed with those of EB1, which is comprised of \u03b2-tyrosine, \u03b2-serine, \u03b1,\u03b2-diamino-propionic acid, \u03b1-2,6-diamino-7-hydroxyazelaic acid, glycine, and polyamine (Fig. 2A) (23). EB1 inhibited the growth of S. cerevisiae in the NFYG medium in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, growth inhibition in the YG medium was less than 6% at the tested concentrations (Fig. 2B).

When F. graminearum conidia were treated with EB1, conidial germination was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner compared to the non-treatment control; at a concentration of 20 \u00b5g/mL, the conidial germination was inhibited by 75% (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, at the same concentration, we observed that EB1 has higher antifungal activity for inhibiting conidial germination compared to mycelial growth (Fig. 2C and D). Considering that AMPs can cause morphological changes in the plasma membrane and cell wall and increase cell permeability, we observed morphological alterations on F. graminearum grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium supplemented with EB1. The morphology of hyphae treated with EB1 was similar to that of the normal control hyphae based on SEM observation (Fig. 2E). When conidia treated with EB1 (10 \u00b5g/mL) were stained by propidium iodide, the EB1-treated conidia exhibited no red fluorescence similar to the non-treatment control (Fig. 2F). By contrast, ethanol-treated conidia as a positive control exhibited a much stronger red fluorescence than that of the control and EB1 treatment (Fig. 2F), suggesting that EB1 did not trigger fungal cell membrane defects. Given that EB1 exhibits respiratory inhibition activity, we observed the mitochondria of F. graminearum treated with EB1 using transmission electron microscopy. Our results showed that there were no observable morphological changes in mitochondrial structure by EB1 treatment (see Fig. S2). Furthermore, along with no morphological changes of mitochondria, we observed there was no change in mitochondrial superoxide generation in F. graminearum treated with EB1 (see Fig. S3). Taken together, our results suggest that EB1 seems to indirectly regulate mitochondrial respiration in F. graminearum.", "Considering that the peptide antibiotic edeine binds between the P-site and the E-site of the small subunit of the ribosome and consequently impairs protein synthesis (24), we investigated the effects of EB1 on protein synthesis based on fluorescence in fungal cells. As a result, we observed strong green fluorescence signals from the germinated conidia of F. graminearum (Fig. 2G). However, when F. graminearum was treated with 5 and 10 \u00b5g/mL of EB1, the fluorescence intensity was reduced by 72% and 91%, respectively (Fig. 2G); as a positive control, we observed that a translation inhibitor cycloheximide treatment also exhibited a reduced fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2H). Furthermore, when F. graminearum was co-treated with EB1 and cycloheximide, the fluorescence intensity decreased more than that of the single treatment, supporting that EB1 and cycloheximide target different sites on the eukaryotic ribosome (24).", "EB1 downregulated genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation", "Considering that edeines have been widely used as transcriptional inhibitors to study ribosomal function and protein synthesis (25), we performed transcriptomic analysis of the F. graminearum wild-type strain from which the fungal mycelia were treated with EB1 and incubated for 1, 2, and 4 h (Fig. 3A). We considered differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showing differences in transcript accumulation with a log2 fold change of greater than 1 or less than \u22121 (P < 0.05). Compared to the non-treatment control, a total of 7,876 DEGs were identified from F. graminearum mycelia, with 982 and 635 genes exhibiting a significant increase and decrease in all time points, respectively (Fig. 3B). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis on the 1,617 DEGs revealed that the up- and downregulated genes were mainly enriched in \u201cubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis (fgr00130),\u201d \u201cpentose phosphate pathway (fgr00030),\u201d \u201cglycolysis/gluconeogenesis (fgr00010),\u201d \u201cABC transporters (fgr02010),\u201d and \u201cnucleotide metabolism (fgr01232)\u201d (Fig. 3C). In particular, all analyzed genes within the \u201cubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis\u201d pathway exhibited changes in expression levels in the samples treated with EB1 for 4 h (Fig. 3D). Given the crucial role of ubiquinone as a key component of the electron transport chain in the oxidative phosphorylation process (26, 27), these results imply that EB1 has effects on oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, when Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed, the DEGs were highly enriched in GO terms related to ribosomal function such as rRNA processing (GO:0006364), ribosome biogenesis (GO:0042254), and ribosomal large subunit assembly (GO:0000027) in the biological process category (see Fig. S4). In the category of molecular function, ATP binding (GO:0005524) was a dominant term, and translation initiation-related GO terms were identified, including translation initiation factor activity (GO:0003743), RNA helicase activity (GO:0003724), and translation initiation factor binding (GO:0031369). For the cellular component, the DEGs were enriched in nucleolus (GO:0005730), mitochondrion (GO:0005739), and mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743). These results suggest that EB1 may play an important role in the ribosome biogenesis, translation, and mitochondrial function of F. graminearum.", "Fig 3Transcriptome analysis of F. graminearum treated with EB1.

EB1 showed potent antifungal activity against wild-type S. pombe cells for 21 h (GI50 = 80 \u00b5M; see Fig. S5). DIH by EB1 in various S. pombe heterozygous deletion mutants revealed that the fitness scores of 10 gene deletion mutants were over 2.5 among the mutants, and a mpc1-deleted strain had the highest fitness value of 3.99 (Fig. 5A and B). Among the F. graminearum homologs to the 10 S. pombe genes, we found that six homologs were differentially expressed in response to EB1 (Fig. 5C). In particular, two genes FGSG_09250 encoding NADH dehydrogenase flavoprotein 1 in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and FGSG_07074 encoding mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 were assigned to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (fgr00190) and mitochondrial biogenesis (fgr03029) of F. graminearum KEGG database, respectively. To further determine whether the target deletion of six homologs (FGSG_07074, 08530, 09250, 09683, 13011, and 13152) leads to chemical sensitivity to EB1, we generated gene deletion strains (see Fig. S6) and compared the growth of the wild-type and the deletion strains according to the treatment of EB1.

They were selected because their expressions were significantly increased and decreased by EB1, respectively (Fig. 6A).

As a result, the \u039401981 strain was more sensitive to EB1 compared to the wild-type strain below a concentration of 12.5 \u00b5g/mL; in particular, the greatest difference (2.7-fold) was shown at a concentration of 3.1 \u00b5g/mL (Fig. 6B). In addition, when we investigated the growth difference to fluopyram which binds to the ubiquinone-binding sites in the succinate dehydrogenase complex composed of four subunits (SdhA, SdhB, SdhC, and SdhD), the deletion of FgSdhC1 also led to a change in fluopyram sensitivity (Fig. 6B).

The non-treatment control exhibited typical head blight symptoms, which manifested as discoloration, at 5 days post-inoculation (dpi), whereas the treatments with HK544 CF and EB1 led to suppressed FHB development in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A and B). In addition, given that chemical fungicides inhibiting mitochondrial respiration induce trichothecene production of F. graminearum (16, 17), we investigated whether HK544 CF containing EB1 induces trichothecene production. The results showed that the cultures treated with HK544 CF produced reduced trichothecenes in a dose-dependent manner without the differential expression of the trichothecene biosynthetic genes TRI5 (FGSG_03537; trichodiene synthase) and TRI6 (FGSG_03536; transcription factor) between the treated and untreated cultures (Fig. 7C and D).

First, we determined the MIC values of each ETC inhibitor against F. graminearum.

Because the fractional inhibitory concentration index estimates the drug interactions at the MIC levels, we used a zero interaction potency (ZIP) model to understand the interactions over the entire range of concentrations (28). When EB1 (ranging from 1.6 to 25 \u2009\u00b5g/mL; MIC value of 12.5 \u2009\u00b5g/mL; see Fig. S9) was combined with ETC inhibitors, the highest average synergy score (18.337) was observed in the combination of EB1 + rotenone among the tested combinations although the 2D and 3D plots of the model-specific statistic showed regions of synergy in all the tested combinations (Fig. 8).

When EB1 was combined with the complex I inhibitor fenazaquin (MIC, >200 \u00b5g/mL) and complex II inhibitor fluopyram (MIC, 100 \u00b5g/mL), the average ZIP score was 14.107 and 5.864 (Fig. 8), respectively, suggesting that there was a synergistic effect between EB1 and the complex I inhibitor fenazaquin. These results show that EB1 synergistically interacts with complex I inhibitors rotenone and fenazaquin for the respiratory inhibition of F. graminearum."]
