["Results", "Trapping phototoxins in LDs serves as a resistance mechanism in an endolichenic fungus", "Our previous investigation of an endolichenic fungus, Phaeosphaeria sp., from the lichen Heterodermia obscurata (Nyl.) Trevis (Fig. 1A\u2013E), led to the discovery of a series of PQs that harbour cytotoxic activity due to the high yields of reactive oxygen species (ROS) they produce upon light irradiation2526. We sought to understand the self-resistance mechanisms that this producer evolved to these phototoxins.", "The perylenequinonoid skeleton of PQs makes fluorescent microscopic analysis a convenient method by which to study these compounds. Examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that the thallus of the lichen was composed of filaments and algae cells (Fig. 1B,C). Stereoscopic analysis using z-stacks demonstrated that the filaments were embedded within the lichen (Supplementary Results and Supplementary Video 1). The filaments produced substances that displayed orange and red fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Video 1), in agreement with the characteristics of isolated PQs25. The endolichenic fungus Phaeosphaeria sp., which produces the phototoxins, was isolated and purified (Fig. 1D,E). When the fungus was exposed to light, it grew at a much slower rate compared with that cultured in darkness (Supplementary Fig. 2A). We observed that pigments accumulated in the LDs of the fungi filaments, as indicated by BODIPY staining of the LDs (Fig. 1F,G). By contrast, red fluorescent granules were secreted by the dark-cultured organisms (white arrow, Supplementary Fig. 2B). Because PQs can be activated by light to generate high quantum yields of ROS, especially singlet oxygen (1O2), which results in phototoxicity252627, the ability of the microorganism to trap PQs in LDs led us to hypothesise that LDs may play a key role in self-resistance.", "To test this hypothesis, we used the PQ derivative HA (Fig. 1H), which is the main constituent in Phaeosphaeria sp. and displays potent antifungal, antibacterial and antivirus activities2527282930, as a molecular tool for an in vitro study. Because it is a hydrophobic agent, HA has a very high octanol-water partition coefficient (KOW) with a Log P greater than 4, and it is easily dissolved in lipophilic solvents. When HA was dissolved in different solvents of variable polarity or in solvents containing triglycerides to mimic LD components, light-driven 1O2 production by HA was proportional to the polarity of the solvents (Fig. 1I). The lower ROS production observed when HA was in nonpolar solvents suggested that their localisation in LDs may be a resistance mechanism in this endolichenic fungus.", "To explore whether this specific mechanism is also used by other fungi, further experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of LD size or LD formation on resistance to the phototoxicity of HA.", "Large LDs confer resistance to lipophilic toxins in yeast", "To determine the relationship between LD size and resistance to external toxins, HA was again used to assess light-induced toxicity in the pathogenic fungus C. albicans. The majority of C. albicans strain SC5314 cells were rapidly killed by HA when exposed to light irradiation, with few viable sub-populations remaining (Fig. 2A). The in-dark test verified that HA was accumulated in vesicle-like structures identified as LDs by BODIPY staining31 (Fig. 2B) rather than in vacuoles or the nucleus, as indicated by CMAC and DAPI staining, respectively3233 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Further tests showed that the trapped HA reached its peak concentration within 10\u2009minutes of incubation (Supplementary Fig. 4). Using two other PQ derivatives, phaeosphaerin A (PA) and phaeosphaerin C (PC), as probes (Supplementary Fig. 5) or by changing the host from C. albicans to S. cerevisiae (Supplementary Fig. 6), we observed that the phototoxic PQs were trapped in the LDs of the fungal cells. CLSM examination showed that the surviving yeast cells were phenotypic variants with large LDs (Fig. 2C).", "To further demonstrate that an increase in the size of the LDs confers resistance, oleate was used to increase LD size (Supplementary Fig. 7). We found that larger LDs trapped larger amounts of HA when cells were cultured in YPD medium containing oleate (YPDO), which confirmed the storage function of LDs (Fig. 2D). We then studied the relationship between the size of LDs and cell fate in response to HA-mediated phototoxins in real time. Time-lapse experiments showed that the onset of cell death was greatly delayed in cells with larger LDs (LLDs) that were cultured in YPDO medium compared to cells with small LDs (SLDs) that were cultured in YPD medium (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Videos 2 and 3). Furthermore, statistical analysis of survival times revealed that cells with LLDs were much more resistant to HA-mediated phototoxins than did cells with SLDs (Fig. 2E).", "LD-deficient yeast mutants are much more sensitive to lipophilic toxins", "To validate the important role of LDs in drug resistance, we tested the susceptibility of LD mutant strains to the toxicity of HA. The core lipids\u2014triacylglycerols (TAGs) and sterol esters (SEs)\u2014are known to be the major constituents of LDs20. In S. cerevisiae, Are1p and Are2p are primarily responsible for the synthesis of SEs, and Dga1p and Lro1p are responsible for the formation of the majority of the TAGs34. Based on the homologous genes in S. cerevisiae, the genes ARE2 (orf19.2248), LRO1 (orf19.6018) and DGA2 (orf19.6941) in C. albicans, which share sequence identity with their S. cerevisiae orthologues of 45.54%, 55.00% and 32.99%, respectively, were analysed to determine their roles in LD formation. The mRNA levels of ARE2, DGA1 and LRO1 were upregulated in response to oleate stimulation, suggesting a possible function for these genes in driving LD formation (Supplementary Fig. 9). We then created the mutant strains are2\u0394/are2, lro1\u0394/lro1\u0394 and dga2\u0394/dga2\u0394 via homologous recombination (Supplementary Methods). CLSM observations and flow cytometry measurement revealed that only the dga2\u0394/dga2\u0394 strain lost the ability to form LDs (Fig. 3A,B), consistent with a recent report that the two isoforms of diacylglycerol acyltransferase are responsible for neutral lipid synthesis in Candida tropicalis35. We then tested the susceptibility of the mutant strain dga2\u0394/dga2\u0394 to HA-mediated photodynamic inactivation. The dga2\u0394/dga2\u0394 strain became more susceptible to HA compared with the parent strain BWP17 when exposed to light irradiation (Fig. 3C).", "The LD-deficient mutants of S. cerevisiae31 were also used to test susceptibility to HA-mediated photodynamic inactivation. A single defect in TAG synthesis (are1\u0394 are2\u0394) or SE synthesis (dga1\u0394 lro1\u0394) had a smaller effect on sensitivity to HA-mediated phototoxicity. However, the quadruple mutant strain (dga1\u0394 lro1 \u0394are1\u0394 are2\u0394), which does not form neutral lipids, was highly susceptible to the photodynamic inactivation of HA (Fig. 3D).", "LDs quench intracellular ROS production caused by HA", "Based on the above findings that neutral lipids or lipophilic agents trap HA and quench ROS formation (Figs 1I and 2), we next investigated the effect of HA-mediated phototoxicity on ROS production in C. albicans cells. Large amounts of ROS were produced in the HA-treated cells cultured in YPD medium (Fig. 4A,C). However, C. albicans cells harboured larger LDs and produced less ROS when cultured in YPDO medium (Fig. 4B,D). The C. albicans mutant strain dga2\u0394/dga2\u0394, which has a reduced ability to form LDs, generated much more ROS in the presence of HA-mediated photodynamic inactivation compared with its parent strain BWP17, as indicated by DCF fluorescence (Fig. 5A,B). As expected, measurements of HA-mediated phototoxicity in S. cerevisiae showed that much lower yields of intracellular ROS were generated in the wild type strain BY4742 compared with the LD-deficient mutant strain (dga1\u0394 lro1 \u0394are1\u0394 are2\u0394) (Fig. 5C,D). Based on these results, we concluded that LD-induced resistance is a result of the cells escaping oxidative damage by compartmentalising toxins into LDs and the consequent sequestration of ROS formation.", "LD-deficient mutants are more sensitive to some fungicides", "Taking into consideration the central roles of LDs in self-resistance to endotoxins and drug resistance to extracellular toxins, we were interested in assessing the impact of yeast LDs on other antibiotics. The susceptibility of C. albicans cells cultured in YPD or YPDO medium to clinically-used antifungal agents36 and the quorum sensing molecule farnesol3738 was tested. We found that the growth inhibition caused by fluconazole (FLC), terbinafine (Ter), caspofungin (CAS), amphotericin B (AmB) and miconazole (Mic) was not significantly different in the cells cultured in the above two culture media (Supplementary Fig. 10A, B). By contrast, C. albicans cells with large LDs were resistant to farnesol compared with cells with small LDs, possibly due to differences in intracellular distribution (Supplementary Fig. 10C). By examining the intracellular fluorescence distribution of dansyl-labelled amphotericin B (AmB-Ds)39, we found that AmB-Ds was bound to the cytoplasmic membrane and spread throughout the cytoplasm of dead cells rather than localising to specific LDs in C. albicans (Supplementary Fig. 11), in accordance with a previous report showing that AmB aggregates in the cell membrane and extracts ergosterol from the lipid bilayers40. This suggested that LDs had a smaller effect on the trapping of most of these clinically used antifungal agents. However, AmB or Mic treatment stimulated an increase in the number and size of LDs in C. albicans (Supplementary Fig. 12A). A similar result was obtained when farnesol was studied, whereas no significant effects were observed following Ter, CAS or FLC treatments (Supplementary Fig. 12B). These results suggest that the increased size or number of LDs was a stress response to treatment with antifungal agents, although the cells with large LDs did not escape death (Supplementary Fig. 12C). This is consistent with a previous finding that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducers, such as tunicamycin and brefeldin A, stimulate LD formation in S. cerevisiae but do not guarantee cell survival during ER stress41.", "Further testing of dga2\u0394/dga2\u0394 in growth inhibition assays with CAS, FLC, Ter, farnesol, AmB and Mic showed that dga2\u0394/dga2\u0394 was more susceptible to farnesol, AmB, and Mic than its parent strain BWP17. However, no significant differences were observed between dga2\u0394/dga2\u0394 and BWP17 in their responses to other drugs (Supplementary Fig. 13). Moreover, susceptibility testing of S. cerevisiae showed that the LD mutants were also highly susceptible to farnesol, AmB, and Mic, especially the strains that could not synthesise TAGs (RSY3290) or neutral lipids (RSY3077) (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15). These data collectively demonstrate that disruption of LD formation renders yeast cells more susceptible to some antifungal agents, although LD-induced resistance was not a universal response to all types of drugs."]
