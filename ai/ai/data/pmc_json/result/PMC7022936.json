["3. Results", "3.1. Prediction and Analysis of the Gliotoxin Biosynthesis Cluster of D. cejpii", "The genome of D. cejpii was sequenced, assembled, and annotated. Approximately 8065 genes were predicted, and the length of the total genome sequence was 23,887,422 nt. The gene clusters for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were predicted using antiSMASH version 5.0.0. Seventeen gene clusters comprising gli cluster for gliotoxin biosynthesis were found in the genome of D. cejpii (Figure S1). A total of 12 putative gliotoxin synthetic genes (approximately 27.5 kb) were predicted, and the functional annotation of the genes using eukaryotic orthologous groups indicated that almost all genes in the gli cluster of D. cejpii can be found in the gli cluster in A. fumigatus, suggesting the similar function of these genes including gliZ as gliotxin biosynthetic genes (Figure 1). However, the difference in the genes\u2019 arrangements between the gli clusters of D. cejpii and A. fumigatus suggested the different biosynthetic mechanisms of gliotoxins for the two fungi. Furthermore, the gliM gene was annotated as an O-methyltransferase by gene prediction, and the gliH gene (function remains unclear) was related to the synthesis of gliotoxin lacking in D. cejpii, indicating that different chemical modification by the enzymatic reaction might exist. The promoters of genes in the gli cluster of D. cejpii were predicted and named as pG, pM, pCP, pI, pTF, pN, and pA, respectively.", "3.2. Conserved Domain of Zn2Cys6 Transcriptional Factor DcGliZ", "The complete genome sequence of D. cejpii enabled the robust prediction of the gli cluster transcriptional factor DcGliZ. The Zn2Cys6 domain of DcGliZ was located in the region between amino acids at the positions of 16 and 59 according to Pfam analysis, and the 3D model of partial sequence of DcGliZ (mainly Zn2Cys6 region) was created using SWISS-MODEL and PyMol (Fig.S2A). The model illustrated that the structure of Zn2Cys6 contained an \u03b1-helix and two \u03b2-sheets, and the amino acid in DcGliZ including cys22, cys25, cys32, cys38, cys41, and cys48 were covalently linked with two zinc ions, which facilitated the formation and stabilization of the finger configuration, and thus ensured the regulatory function of DcGliZ by completely inlaying the major groove of the specific DNA sequence.", "For the determination of the phylogenetic relationship of DcGliZ with other Zn2Cys6-type GliZs derived from different fungi, alignment analysis was carried out. The similarity between DcGliZ and AclZ, AflaGliZ, SirGliZ, AfGliZ, PlGliZ, and TvGliZ was 37.5%, 38.5%, 38.5%, 53.2%, 48.2%, and 35.4%, respectively. The results indicated that the DcGliZ sequence of D. cejpii showed high similarity to other fungal GliZs in the DNA binding region Zn2Cys6 (Figure 2A), suggesting that the regulatory mechanism for gliotoxin biosynthesis in D. cejpii is similar to that in other fungi. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree constructed using the Geneious program indicated that the DcGliZ showed the highest genetic relationship with that of A. fumigatus GliZ (Figure 2B). The similarity of the two GliZs was 38.5%, implying the similar function of DcGliZ as a positive regulator for the gliotoxin biosynthesis.", "3.3. Heterologous Expression and Purification of Full-Length DcGliZ and DcGliZ Core Proteins from E. coli", "To verify the function of the full-length DcGliZ and the Zn2Cys6 domain of DcGliZ, the plasmids containing the full-length DcGliZ and core DcGliZ were constructed (Figure 3A); one was the pET22b-core region of DcGliZ expression system containing the first 160 amino acid sequences of full-length DcGliZ, which mainly consisted of the Zn2Cys6 domain (Molecular weight-17.45 kDa, pI-8.6; Figure 3B), and the other was the pET22B-DcGliZ full-length expression system containing the full DcGliZ protein sequence (Molecular weight-50 kDa, pI-6.46; Figure 3C). The DcGliZ core protein expressed in E. coli was soluble, whereas the full-length DcGliZ protein expressed in E. coli was insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs). Thus, a more effective strategy was proposed for the recovery of the misfolded full-length DcGliZ protein and retention of its bioactivity. The results indicated that full-length DcGliZ protein was successfully recovered and purified from IBs and the DcGliZ core protein was also purified from the supernatant of E. coli containing recombinant plasmid after sonication. Finally, we got approximately 5 mL full-length DcGliZ protein (100 mg/mL) and 3 mL DcGliZ core protein (100 mg/mL).", "3.4. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay between Full-Length DcGliZ or DcGliZ Core Protein and Functional Gene Promoters of the Gli Cluster", "To determine which gene promoter within the gli cluster can combine with the full-length DcGliZ transcriptional factor in D. cejpii, pG, pM, pCP, pI, pTF, pN, and pA promoters for gliotoxins biosynthesis were cloned and their corresponding probes were prepared (Figure 4A). The in vitro EMSA experiment results indicated that the full-length DcGliZ protein can only bind to pG, pM, and pN promoters, and the retardation band of the pG promoter probe with DcGliZ was more clear compared with those of the other two promoters (Figure 4B). The sequences of promoters pG, pM, and pN were labeled with biotin, and then the DcGliZ core protein was added to finish the EMSA assay. The retardation band was observed in DcGliZ core protein\u2013pG complex, however, no such retardation band was observed in DcGliZ core protein\u2013pM complex and DcGliZ core protein\u2013pN complex. The sequence of pG promoter was divided into three segments of equal length (G1-1, G1-2, and G1-3) and retardation bands were observed in DcGliZ core protein\u2013G1-1 complex and DcGliZ core protein G1-3 (Figure 4C). The results indicated that, although the core Zn2Cys6 domain of DcGliZ plays a dominant role in the regulation of gliotoxin biosynthesis, other domains or structures in DcGliZ may exist for some unknown regulatory mechanism, owing to the non-binding DcGliZ core protein\u2013pM complex and DcGliZ core protein\u2013pN complex.", "3.5. Affinity and Kinetics Analysis between DcGliZ and Gli Cluster Gene Promoters", "To acquire the accurate binding affinity between full-length DcGliZ and promoters for gliotoxins biosynthesis, the commercial Biacore T200 SPR instrument was employed to a achieve highly specific and sensitive analysis. The factual ligand (full-length DcGliZ) coupling amount (RL) measured by Biacore T200 was 325. The optimal pH condition of 10 mM sodium acetate for the full-length DcGliZ immobilization on the surface of the CM5 chip was 3.0, which was confirmed by the pH scouting experiments, and adequate ligand for promoter capture was provided. Then, glycine-HCl buffer with an optimal pH value of 2.0 for the surface test and regeneration to scout four different promoters guaranteed the accuracy of the affinity and kinetic data.", "The affinity screening results illustrated that full-length DcGliZ showed strong and stable binding capacity with pG, pM, and pN promoters, and the response unit between the full-length DcGliZ and pG, pM, and pN promoters increased with promoter concentration until the response reached saturation status (Figure 5A). Furthermore, the kinetics screening curve indicated that the binding of full-length DcGliZ with the pG, pM, and pN promoters fitted the kinetics model, which slowly increased, steadily reached the saturation point, and then gradually decreased to the original level (Figure 5B). However, the negative control pCP promoter showed no relevant affinity and kinetics binding capacity with the full-length DcGliZ. The affinity and kinetics parameters calculated by the Biacore system indicated that the binding affinities of the full-length DcGliZ to the pG, pM, or pN promoter were 1.60 \u00d7 10\u22127, 1.62 \u00d7 10\u22127, or 1.04 \u00d7 1\u22127 M, respectively (Table S2), which was in accordance with the EMSA results."]
