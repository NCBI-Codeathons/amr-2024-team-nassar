["Results", "Environmental pseudomonads have a large diversity in viral particles that exhibit phylogenetic-specific activities", "To better understand the role of viral particles as weapons in competition between kin bacteria, we selected phylogenetically closely-related environmental Pseudomonas of the Pp and Pc subgroups that encompass the bacterial model Pseudomonas protegens type strain CHA0 (Supplementary Table\u00a01). We first looked at the distribution of viral particle encoding loci in the genomes of this set of Pseudomonas strains using the prediction tool PHASTER (PHAge Search Tool Enhanced Release35), manually verifying each region to classify them as either incomplete or complete prophages. None of the Pseudomonas genomes selected is free of viral particle loci (Fig.\u00a01). Two viral families were identified: Siphoviridae and Myoviridae. PHASTER also classified as intact prophages another set of gene clusters that are incomplete, as they no longer contain the genes encoding the synthesis of the viral capsid. These regions correspond to gene clusters encoding phage tail-related structures designated as R-tailocins and are present in all Pseudomonas genomes used in this study (Fig.\u00a01). Interestingly, there is no correlation with the number or the classification of encoded viral particles and the phylogenetic position of a strain.Fig. 1Intraspecific sensitivity of Pseudomonas protegens (Pp) and Pseudomonas chlororaphis (Pc) subgroup strains when confronted to their viral particles.The viral particle loci inventory was generated using PHASTER35 and manually inspected to discriminate tailocin gene clusters from prophages by checking for genes encoding capsid-related proteins. The prophages were classified as either siphoviruses or myoviruses. No other phage family was detected. Soft agar cultures of the Pseudomonas strains (columns) were challenged with viral particles extracted from cultures of these same strains (rows). Strains producing clear, semi-clear or opaque lysis zones were scored sensitive to the viral particles, while strains producing no lysis zone were considered resistant.

We found that strains were overall more sensitive to the viral particles extracted from phylogenetically closely-related relatives (i.e., from the same subgroup, Pp or Pc) and even to the viral particles extracted from the same species (Fig.\u00a01). Additionally, some Pseudomonas strains, specifically AU13582, AU11706 and AU20219, had no targets within the tested Pp and Pc collection (even though they harbor viral particle loci in their genomes) (Fig.\u00a01). This absence of effect may also be due to the non-production of viral particles following induction. Indeed, some prophages can be maintained as defective prophages20. Pseudomonas sp. AU11706 and Pseudomonas chlororaphis R47 are the only strains that were resistant to all the viral particles extracted from the strains tested in this study (Fig.\u00a01). P. chlororaphis O6 appeared to be sensitive to its own viral particles (Fig.\u00a01). This self-sensitivity reaction could be a cause of the reinfection by one of the two prophages contained in this bacterial strain.", "Together these results support the hypothesis that some viral particles are produced to target particularly phylogenetically closely-related strains.", "Viral particle dissection unveils individual species and subgroup target specialization", "When we focused on the model CHA0, PHASTER found three prophage-like sequences (Fig.\u00a01). Two of these regions encode complete phages belonging to the Myoviridae and Siphoviridae families, respectively. Conversely, the third region lacks the genes specifying capsid formation and was identified as the gene cluster encoding the production of two distinct phage tail-like particles that we termed tailocin #1 and tailocin #2 of CHA0 (see below). To determine the specific activity spectrum of each viral particle of CHA0, we deconstructed them by deletion of their coding regions (Supplementary Tables\u00a02, 3, 4) and tested the individual and combined effects of the extracted viral particles on the Pseudomonas strains of this study. A total of six strains were impacted by at least one of the viral particles of CHA0 (Fig.\u00a02a). Affected strains all belong to the Pp subgroup (i.e. BRIP, Cab57, Pf-5, PF, Os17 and CMR5c), amongst which four belong to the P. protegens sensu stricto species (Fig.\u00a01), alongside type strain CHA0 (as they have more than 97% of genomic identity). None of the Pc subgroup strains were affected by the viral particles of CHA0 (Fig.\u00a02a). Moreover, there is a specialization of each viral particle in accordance with the Pseudomonas phylogeny. Tailocin #1 impacted strains from the broader Pp subgroup (i.e. P. protegens PF, Pf-5, Os17 and CMR5c), while the strains affected by the siphovirus are part of the same species (i.e., P. protegens BRIP, Cab57 and Pf-5) (Fig.\u00a02a). Only P. protegens Pf-5 was sensitive to both tailocin #1 and the siphovirus. The sensitivity of those strains to either tailocin #1 and the siphovirus were similar according to serial dilutions performed (Supplementary Data\u00a01). Tailocin #2 and the myovirus of CHA0 did not lyse any of the Pseudomonas strains tested (Fig.\u00a02a).Fig. 2The viral particles of Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 exhibit different activity spectra towards strains belonging to the Pseudomonas protegens (Pp) subgroup and the Pseudomonas chlororaphis (Pc) subgroup.a Pp (blue) and Pc (orange) strains were challenged with viral particles extracted from the following mutants that were induced or not by 3\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121 of mitomycin C: Tailocins #1 and #2, \u0394myo\u0394siph, CHA5299; Tailocin #1, \u0394tail2\u0394myo\u0394siph, CHA5302; Tailocin #2, \u0394tail1\u0394myo\u0394siph CHA5301; Siphovirus and myovirus, \u0394tailcluster, CHA5285; Siphovirus, \u0394tailcluster\u0394myo CHA5289; Myovirus, \u0394tailcluster\u0394siph CHA5292 (Supplementary Table\u00a02).

We observed the two R-tailocins of CHA0 in the extended (sheath uncontracted) and contracted (sheath contracted, and tube expulsed) forms. Furthermore, the size differed between both R-tailocins as tailocin #1 was longer than tailocin #2 (Fig.\u00a02b, Supplementary Table\u00a05). However, we were not able to visualize the predicted myovirus that we suspect to be a cryptic prophage. This hypothesis is supported by the growth curve of the mutant with only the sequence of the myovirus (\u0394tailcluster\u0394siph) as the cells behave in a similar manner as the mutant lacking all regions encoding viral particles (\u0394tailcluster\u0394siph\u0394myo) in MMC inducing conditions. In fact, in the absence of MMC induction, the mutations leading to the deletion of the different viral particles of CHA0 did not affect bacterial growth (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). When MMC was added, only the mutant no longer producing viral particles (\u0394tailcluster\u0394siph\u0394myo) as well as the mutant harboring only the myovirus sequence (\u0394tailcluster\u0394siph) continued to elongate and did not lyse due to the removal of their lytic systems (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b, 1c, 1d). By contrast, a mutant lacking all viral particles but still harboring the lytic enzymes encoded by the R-tailocin gene cluster (\u0394tail1\u0394tail2\u0394myo\u0394siph) lysed in presence of MMC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b).", "This demonstrates that the viral particles of CHA0 are produced following MMC induction and affect strains from the same subgroup and highly impact strains belonging to the same species.", "Tailocin diversity mirrors the phylogenetic distance between pseudomonads", "As tailocins display a high specificity, we then centered our focus on the genomic region encoding these viral particles. The R-tailocin genomic region of the model CHA0 is flanked by the genes mutS and cinA/recA, respectively. It is composed out of 36 phage-like genes and encodes the structural components to assemble the two distinct R-tailocins (tailocin #1 and tailocin #2) identifiable by TEM (Fig.\u00a02b), including their baseplates, tail spikes, tubes, sheaths, tail fibers, and putative assembly chaperones (Fig.\u00a03a, Supplementary Table\u00a04). Each CHA0 R-tailocin is predicted to have its own tail tape measure protein (Fig.\u00a03a) that by analogy with related proteins36,37 is thought to scaffold the respective tail tubes during their assembly. Interestingly, the coding sequence of the tail tape measure protein for tailocin #1 is markedly longer than the one for tailocin #2, which explains the different lengths of the two particles (Supplementary Table\u00a05). The R-tailocin cluster of CHA0 is also equipped with a set of genes encoding a holin, two endolysins and a spanin complex (Fig.\u00a03a, Supplementary Table\u00a04), i.e. all components known to be required for the lysis of the bacterial cell wall and the release of the phage-like particles38. The organization of the genes specifying these structural components is different for the two R-tailocins indicating that they have most probably evolved from two independent prophage infections.Fig. 3Architecture of the R-tailocin gene cluster of Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 and diversity of tailocin clusters among strains of the Pseudomonas protegens (Pp) subgroup and Pseudomonas chlororaphis (Pc) subgroup.a The R-tailocin gene cluster of P. protegens CHA0 is composed out of 36 phage-related genes that encode two distinct R-tailocin complexes (tailocin #1, tailocin #2).

The analysis of the synteny of the various genomic clusters identified loci encoding four different viral particle groups, i.e., three distinct R-tailocins and one F-tailocin (Fig.\u00a03b). One of the R-tailocin loci is conserved amongst all the genomes selected and is conserved with tailocin #2 of CHA0 (green-colored gene clusters), while the other two R-tailocin loci are separated between the Pp, which corresponds to tailocin #1 of CHA0 (purple-colored gene clusters), and Pc subgroups (orange-colored gene clusters) (Fig.\u00a03b). The F-tailocin locus is only present in the genome of some strains belonging to the Pp subgroup (blue-colored gene clusters, Fig.\u00a03b). Interestingly, within this hotspot region, the strain P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens O6 carries a complete prophage in addition to two R-tailocin loci (Fig.\u00a03b). We hypothesize that this is a recent acquisition that may be later domesticated to form a tailocin-type weapon. Although the clusters of the four different types of tailocins are conserved amongst the various genomes, there are differences, notably in the genes encoding the tail fibers (Fig.\u00a03b). This is probably a consequence of the specialization in activity spectra as these structures are involved in host specificity39,40. Additionally, there is only a limited similarity amongst the genes located at the extremities of the clusters (Fig.\u00a03b). All the investigated tailocin loci encode a protein similar to PrtR, a regulator of tailocin production in pseudomonads31, as well as conserved proteins involved in the release of these particles such as holins and lysins (Fig.\u00a03b).", "To conclude, tailocin loci are omnipresent in the genomes of the selected Pseudomonas strains and, even though they are conserved between the different strains, the significant variations of sequences encoding some structural components, notably tail fibers, may account for the various specificities and divergences in the activity spectra of the different viral particles.", "Visualization of the production dynamic of R-tailocins reveals a specific migratory pattern prior to cell lysis", "Following the analysis of the R-tailocin gene cluster of CHA0, we monitored the cellular production dynamics and the release of both R-tailocins simultaneously by fluorescently labeling the sheath proteins of tailocin #1 and tailocin #2 with mScarlet-I and sfGFP, respectively, and visualizing the cells with time-lapse microscopy following induction with MMC.", "During the first 90\u2009min post-induction, cells elongated (Fig.\u00a04a, Supplementary Movie\u00a01). This can be explained by the fact that MMC induces double-strand breaks in the DNA affecting DNA replication and inhibiting cell division41,42. Fluorescent R-tailocins started being visible around 90\u2009min post induction (Fig.\u00a04a, Supplementary Movie\u00a01). Interestingly, the R-tailocins of CHA0 appeared to be produced at the center of the cell and then migrated to the cellular poles where they accumulated and formed distinct foci prior to cell lysis (Fig.\u00a04a, b, Supplementary Movies\u00a01, 2).Fig. 4Temporal and spatial formation and release of tailocins #1 and #2 in Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 cells following induction with mitomycin C.Panels a, b, c show the different examples of the production dynamic of the two R-tailocins. a and b R-tailocins are produced at the center of the cell and migrate to cell poles.

The transition between spherical shape and complete lysis occurred rapidly. Strikingly, when cells completely lysed, there appeared to be a strong ejection force thrusting fluorescent R-tailocins far from their point of origin (several tens of micrometers) (Fig.\u00a04c, Supplementary Movie\u00a03). We observed this extent of tailocin dispersion in all time-lapse experiments performed (more than 10 with at least 10 different positions observed). Although this may be a consequence of explosive cell lysis, it could be a mechanism to target cells that are further away. After cellular lysis, both fluorescently labeled R-tailocins became visible in the background (Fig.\u00a04c, Supplementary Movie\u00a03), demonstrating that once ejected from the producing cells, R-tailocins speckle the medium.", "Visualization of the killing activity of individual R-tailocin in direct competition between two strains", "Once produced and thrusted in the medium, R-tailocins are thought to adsorb to the surface of targeted competing cells25. Hence, we wanted to determine if R-tailocins have an effect on the competitiveness of cells during competition towards their kin, both in non-induced condition and upon artificial induction of tailocin production by MMC. Therefore, we selected a strain sensitive to tailocin #1 of CHA0, namely Pf-5 (Fig.\u00a02), and first confirmed its sensitivity to this viral particle in liquid cultures through the addition of purified tailocin #1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c). Second, we observed Pf-5 in direct competition with CHA0 expressing fluorescently labeled R-tailocins (tailocin #1 with mScarlet-I, tailocin #2 with sfGFP) using time-lapse microscopy. As the production of R-tailocins is a rare event without induction (less than 1%, Supplementary Fig.\u00a03, Supplementary Data\u00a02), since their production is a fatal decision for the individual cell, we induced their production in CHA0 with MMC prior to placing the so-primed strain into cell-to-cell competition with Pf-5. CHA0 cells were thoroughly washed 30\u2009min following induction as not to induce Pf-5 cells by the chemical. As observed previously, following the induction of CHA0, fluorescent R-tailocins were produced at the center of the cell and migrated to the cell poles (Fig.\u00a05, Supplementary Movies\u00a04, 5). Following the production of the R-tailocins, CHA0 cells lysed and thrusted the viral particles in the environment where they attacked cells of the competitor Pf-5. The production of R-tailocins and the lysis of different CHA0 cells resulted in the lysis of several Pf-5 cells in their vicinity (Fig.\u00a05, Supplementary Movies\u00a04, 5), providing live cellular support for the idea that these phage tail-like devices are efficient weapons for killing kin competitors. However, we expected that the production of R-tailocins would have a more drastic impact on the competitor as Pf-5 is notably sensitive to preparations of purified tailocin #1. We hypothesized that the presence of the fluorescent tag may have an influence on the conformation of tailocin #1, thus impacting its activity. Indeed, examination of purified mScarlet-I tagged tailocin #1 by TEM revealed that the tagged sheath is more compact and therefore it likely has more difficulty efficiently contracting compared to the native form (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a, b, Supplementary Table\u00a05). Activity testing against Pf-5 cells in liquid cultures confirmed a loss of efficacy compared to the native form (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c, d).Fig. 5Following induction of Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 R-tailocins are thrusted in the environment to kill competing Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5.CHA0 cells with tagged tailocin #1 (mScarlet-I) and tailocin #2 (sfGFP) were induced with mitomycin C, washed and confronted with Pf-5 mTurquoise2 cells and monitored with epifluorescence time-lapse microscopy (see Supplementary Movie\u00a04).

Importantly, assays were carried out in non-induced conditions, i.e. without prior MMC induction of CHA0. We observed that the lysis and assumedly the production of R-tailocins and more specifically tailocin #1 had a pronounced effect on the survival of the kin competitor Pf-5. Representative confrontations are shown in Fig.\u00a06 and Supplementary Movie\u00a06, 7, 8. The time-lapse observations show that following the lysis of one CHA0 wild-type cell, on average 17.6 Pf-5 cells were killed (Fig.\u00a06a, Supplementary Table\u00a06, Supplementary Movie\u00a06). Moreover, following the lysis of one CHA0 \u0394tail2\u0394myo\u0394siph cell (producing exclusively tailocin #1), on average 12.6 Pf-5 cells were killed (Fig.\u00a06b, Supplementary Table\u00a06, Supplementary Movie\u00a07). On the contrary, the lysis of CHA0 cells producing only tailocin #2 (CHA0 \u0394tail1\u0394myo\u0394sipho) did not affect the survival of Pf-5 cells (Fig.\u00a06c, Supplementary Movie\u00a08). The killing effect of the CHA0 tailocin #1 during kin bacterial competition against Pf-5 was amplified by inducing CHA0 cells with MMC prior to competition (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04, Supplementary Movies\u00a09, 10, 11). Furthermore, we observed that the tailocin #1 of CHA0 could target Pf-5 cells that were not in close vicinity of a tailocin-producing CHA0 cell (Supplementary Movie\u00a012).Fig. 6Exclusive involvement of tailocin #1 of Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 during the direct competition against Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 in non-induced conditions (i.e. no mitomycin C induction of CHA0).The competition between Pf-5 mTurquoise2 and a CHA0 wild type (Supplementary Movie\u00a06), b the CHA0 mutant able to produce exclusively tailocin #1 (\u0394tail2\u0394myo\u0394siph) (Supplementary Movie\u00a07), or c the CHA0 mutant able to produce only tailocin #2 (\u0394tail1\u0394myo\u0394siph) (Supplementary Movie\u00a08) was followed by time-lapse microscopy.

The fitness of CHA0 was significantly higher in liquid competitions when it could produce only tailocin #1 instead of only tailocin #2 (Fig.\u00a07). However, this gain in fitness was limited as it did not allow CHA0 to outcompete Pf-5 (Fig.\u00a07a). Conversely, this fitness gain is dependent on environmental conditions as no differences were observed on solid medium (Fig.\u00a07b). We hypothesize that this difference may be due to limited spatial diffusion of R-tailocins on solid medium compared to liquid medium.Fig. 7Tailocin #1 contributes to the competitiveness of Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 toward P.\u00a0protegens Pf-5.The competitiveness of CHA0 wild type and mutants producing exclusively the tailocin #1 (\u0394tail2\u0394myo\u0394siph) or the tailocin #2 (\u0394tail1\u0394myo\u0394siph), or none of the viral particles (\u0394tail1 \u0394tail2\u0394myo\u0394siph) was assessed in 1:1 mixtures with Pf-5 during 24\u2009h in liquid (a) and on solid (b) media.

Compared to investigations by microscopy as highlighted in the present study, classical co-culture assays may not always be an adequate and sensitive tool to detect phage-like particle-mediated microscale interactions."]
