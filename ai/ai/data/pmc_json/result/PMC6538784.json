["RESULTS", "The ABC transporter systems encoded by the zms gene cluster are not required for zeamine resistance in D. zeae EC1.", "As the transporter systems present within the antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters often confer resistance to the encoded antibiotics, we conducted bioinformatics analysis of the five transporter genes, i.e., zmsP, zmsQ, zmsR, zmsL, and zmsM (NCBI accession no. WP_016943528.1, WP_016943529.1, WP_016943530.1, WP_016943542.1, and WP_016943543.1, respectively) within the zms gene cluster of D. zeae EC1 (Fig.\u00a01) (12). These genes share similar genetic organization (Fig.\u00a01) and high levels of identity and similarity in amino acids (above 69% and 82%, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2) to their homologs found in S. plymuthica and other Dickeya species and strains with the zms gene clusters (8). Among them, sequence analysis showed that zmsP encodes a potential HlyD family protein, zmsR and zmsM encode potential ABC transporter permeases, and zmsQ and zmsL encode potential ABC transporter ATPases. The homologs of zmsM and zmsL were hypothesized to encode a zeamine transporter, conferring self-resistance against zeamines in S. plymuthica RVH1 (6). As a previous study indicated that the HlyD family protein could form a functional transport system with ABC transporter proteins (22), ZmsP was considered a part of the ABC transporter systems encoded by the zms gene cluster. To elucidate the potential roles of these genes in zeamine resistance, in-frame deletion was performed to generate the deletion mutants of zmsR and zmsM, respectively, which represent the two putative transport systems encoded by the zms gene cluster of D. zeae EC1. Zeamines were purified from the cell culture of D. zeae EC1 and confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material) and used for determination of MIC against different bacterial strains in this study. The results showed that inactivation of zmsR or zmsM could not cause any change in the MIC of zeamines compared with those of the wild-type strain EC1 (data not shown). These findings preclude the possible association of these ABC transport systems with zeamine resistance, and their roles remain to be further investigated.", "FIG\u00a01Organization of transporter genes within and adjacent to the zms gene cluster in Dickeya species and Serratia plymuthica strains.

One of the gene clusters encodes a putative AcrA-like adaptor protein, and the other encodes a potential AcrB-like inner membrane protein. The AcrAB-TolC RND efflux system has been well characterized as being associated with multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli, including \u03b2-lactams, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and rifampin, with acrAB located together in the genome and tolC at a distant location (15). We proposed to name these two genes desA and desB, for Dickeya\nefflux system proteins A and B (Fig.\u00a01). Interestingly, the desAB genes are not present within the vicinity of the zms gene cluster in S. plymuthica strains (Fig.\u00a01).", "Topological analysis of DesB revealed typical features of inner membrane transporter protein in an RND efflux system with 12 transmembrane helix domains (TM) and 2 large periplasmic loops spanning from TM1 to TM2 and TM7 to TM8 (Fig.\u00a0S2) (23). In RND efflux systems, a tripartite complex is required for the full function of substrate transportation. To identify the outer channel protein for DesAB, a BLAST search was conducted to identify the homolog of E. coli outer membrane protein TolC. The result showed that only one tolC homolog (74% identity and 86% similarity at the amino acid level) is present in the genome of D. zeae EC1, which was designated desC accordingly. To elucidate the role of the DesABC system in zeamine resistance, three des genes were deleted in-frame separately at the background of the strain defective in zeamine production, i.e., zmsA in-frame deletion mutant. Inactivation of desA and desB led to about an 8-fold decrease in the MIC of zeamines, while deletion of desC led to about a 32-fold decrease in MIC (Table\u00a01). Consistent with the above-described results, in trans expression of desB and desC in the corresponding mutants could increase the zeamine resistance level of the mutants (Table\u00a01). In addition, we found that heterologous expression of desABC under the control of the lac and tetO promoter in E. coli DH5\u03b1 increased the MIC of zeamines by 2-fold (Table\u00a01).

For example, MexY from P. aeruginosa is required for streptomycin resistance (24), MexB and AcrB from P. aeruginosa and E. coli are associated with chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance (25, 26), CmeB from Campylobacter jejuni plays a role in resistance against ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and tetracycline (27), and AdeB in Acinetobacter baumannii BM4454 is involved in tetracycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and kanamycin resistance (28). To understand the potential substrate profile of the DesABC efflux pump, a phylogenic tree was constructed with DesB of D. zeae EC1 and its homologs (sequence similarity above 93%) found by blastp search in Dickeya species, other proteobacterial species, including the homologs (sequence similarity above 80%) from S. plymuthica strains containing the zms gene cluster, as well as the above-mentioned inner membrane proteins with known functions (Table\u00a0S3). The DesB phylogeny was largely consistent with known evolutionary relationships among the bacterial genomes. All of the Dickeya DesB proteins formed a monophyletic clade in the tree, whereas the homologs from other genera were more distantly related (Fig.\u00a0S3). Notably, the inner membrane proteins with known substrate profiles were clustered together on the tree and showed considerable divergence from the DesB homologs from Dickeya species. The result suggests that DesB and its homologs from Dickeya species have a different substrate profile than their counterparts from other bacterial species.", "Phylogenic relationship of DesB with the inner membrane proteins of other RND efflux pumps.

MIC assay was also performed using antibiotics which belong to different classes and have different targets (Table\u00a0S4).

At the early stage after inoculation (12 to 24\u2009h), the growth rate and zeamine production were comparable between strain EC1 and the desB mutant (Fig.\u00a03A). However, the growth of the desB mutant was arrested in the subsequent stages after 24\u2009h (Fig.\u00a03A), and similarly, accumulation of zeamines in bacterial supernatant was also flattened after 24\u2009h (Fig.\u00a03B).

As a control, we also tested whether expression of desAB could be induced by polymyxin B by incubation of the \u0394zmsA(pDesABgfp) strain with polymyxin B at the same concentration as zeamines. The results showed that unlike zeamines, polymyxin B could not trigger the expression of desAB genes (Fig.\u00a04D).
