1. Introduction The family Streptomycetaceae within the phylum Actinobacteria is one of the most diverse and ubiquitous soil bacterial groups [1] represented by three genera, classified as Streptomyces, Kitasatospora and Streptacidiphilus, which are closely related on phylogenetic and phenotypic aspects [2]. The representatives of this family are well-known for their roles in biodegradation (e.g., lignocellullose, chitin), secondary metabolite (SM) production and plant growth-promoting potential [3]. Among these three genera, Streptacidiphilus includes acidophilic species, and is phylogenetically more related with Kitasatospora as compared to Streptomyces [4,5]. They form branched substrate mycelia and aerial hyphae which are differentiated into long straight to flexuous chains of smooth surfaced spores. The whole-organism hydrolysates of Streptacidiphilus cell wall peptidoglycan contain LL-diaminopimelic acid (LL-DAP), a feature also observed in Streptomyces [5]. The cell wall peptidoglycan of Kitasatospora, on the other hand, contains either LL-DAP or meso-DAP in different parts of the mycelial structures [6]. Actinobacteria in general have been a great source of novel antibiotics, but the majority of these microbial compounds, such as cycloheximide [7], avermectins [8], hygromycin [9], and many others with known biological implications, have been derived from the family Streptomycetaceae, especially from Streptomyces. Similarly, the genus Kitasatospora has also been the producer of several important SMs, such as setamycin, phosalacine, and endophenaside antibiotics that are mainly active against eukaryotic organisms [10,11,12,13]. Representatives of Streptomycetaceae are also considered as the key organisms in carbon recycling because of their potential to degrade biopolymers [3]. However, only Streptomyces has been the focus of study in most of these studies [14,15]. Nevertheless, the potential of Kitasatospora in the degradation of biopolymers, chitosan in soil for example, has been demonstrated in a limited number of studies [16,17]. Recently, a group of tripeptides designated acidiphilamides were discovered as the first known SMs from a representative of Streptacidiphilus, namely Streptacidiphilus rugosus AM-16T [18]. These acidiphilamides significantly inhibited cellular autophagy and highlighted the fact that under-investigated rare actinobacterial genera could serve as a good resource for novel bioactive natural products. With the advancement in the genome sequencing technology, it was revealed that microorganisms still represent an essential source for novel natural products that need to be explored [19]. For example, the genome information of two well-studied species, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) [3] and Streptomyces avermitilis [20], revealed the presence of several cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), thereby highlighting their potential to produce new metabolites in addition to the existing ones from these organisms [21]. Since the complete genome sequence of Str. coelicolor A3(2) was first reported [3], a large number of genomes for this genus have become available in the public databases (e.g., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/). Similarly, the genomes of other two under-represented genera, viz, Kitasatospora and Streptacidiphilus, are also available in these databases, albeit to a limited extent. The genus Streptacidiphilus currently includes 15 validly named (http://www.bacterio.net/streptacidiphilus.html) acidophilic species, which in general grow in the pH range between 3.5 and 6.5, with optimum values around pH 4.5â€“5.5 [5]. Similar to Streptomyces and Kitasatospora, the distribution of Streptacidiphilus has also been reported from diverse terrestrial habitats such coal mine waste, acid mine drainage, and acidic forest soils [22,23]. Acidophilic actinobacteria are believed to be promising sources of compounds with antifungal activity and acid-stable enzymes [24,25]. Because soil acidophilic actinobacteria have to face competition with fungi in natural habitats, it is anticipated that they may have higher potential than their neutrophilic counterparts in some activities, e.g., antifungal activity [26,27]. Considering the rapid increase in the reports of new species in recent years, Streptacidiphilus may become a main source of novel metabolites together with the two neighboring genera. Currently, 15 Streptacidiphilus genomes representing 11 species are available in public databases, which makes the genus the least studied one among the three genera of Streptomycetaceae, especially at the genome level. This is supported by the fact that no detailed genomic investigations have been carried out for this genus to date, although there are several brief reports for a limited number of Streptacidiphilus providing basic levels of analysis [4,28,29,30]. This study is a first comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of Streptacidiphilus to get a better understanding of their phylogeny, SM production and biodegradation capabilities. These Streptacidiphilus genomes were further compared with the representative Kitasatospora and Streptomyces species.
