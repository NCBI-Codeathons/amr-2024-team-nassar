1. Introduction Escherichia coli (E. coli) are a group of Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated from multiple body sites of almost every individual, paradoxically implicated in both intestinal homeostasis and various pathologies depending on species and subspecies classification [1]. Certain E. coli strains, primarily from the B2-phylogroup, harbor a pathogenic island termed pks. This biosynthetic gene cluster is widely distributed throughout various Enterobacteriaceae and encodes for a secondary metabolite named colibactin, putatively acquired through horizontal gene transfer as part of a mobile genetic element [2]. The widespread distribution, prevalence, and evolutionary persistence of pks genes in this bacterial family suggest that this biosynthetic gene cluster may promote host fitness. In contrast, these compounds have deleterious effects in eukaryotic cells, inhibiting cell-cycle progression and inducing DNA damage [3,4]. Recently, the structure of colibactin has been identified [5]. Colibactin contains dual electrophilic warheads each capable of binding DNA, suggesting that colibactin causes DNA damage by inducing interstrand DNA-crosslinks [5,6,7]. The production of a genotoxic cyclomodulin by a common commensal microbe (E. coli) led to the hypothesis that these microbes may play a causative role in a subset of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, as exposure to environmental genotoxins may promote specific somatic mutations implicated in a variety of cancers [8]. In murine models of colitis-associated cancer, administration of pks+ E. coli promotes tumor formation [4]. Furthermore, pks+ E. coli are identified in tumor biopsies from CRC (66.7%) and IBD cases (40%) at a higher rate than healthy individuals (20.8%) [4]. Subsequent studies utilizing in vitro models ascertained a unique mutational signature occurring after exposure to pks+ E. coli consistent with the hypothesized nucleotide binding activity of the recently proposed colibactin structure, and identified these mutational signatures in approximately 5% of colorectal cancer patients [9]. Collectively, these studies have generated a high amount of research aimed at elucidating colibactin’s mutagenic potential in the context of CRC etiology. However, colibactin itself is a highly unstable molecule and cancer development is dependent on specific biological context, leading to some debate regarding its role as an initiator of tumorigenesis [10]. Thus, a number of recent studies have focused on identifying how colibactin regulation and pks+
E. coli biology may influence the oncogenic capacity of the compound [11,12,13,14,15,16]. In this review, we will summarize how advances in our understanding of colibactin’s structural mode-of-action have begun to clarify the role pks+ E. coli may play in CRC, and how new findings describing pks regulation shed a light on how physiologic contexts may influence its carcinogenic potential.
