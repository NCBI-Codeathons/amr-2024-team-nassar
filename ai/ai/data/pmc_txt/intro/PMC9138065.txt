1. Introduction Polyether antibiotics, also called polyether ionophores, are a broad class of natural compounds produced by actinomycetes, with the vast majority being derived from the genera Streptomyces and Actinomadura [1]. In recent years, with the discovery of over 120 novel molecules, these chemicals have received more and more attention. Typical polyether antibiotics, including salinomycin, nigericin, lasalocid, and monesin (Figure 1), feature 2–5 ether oxygen atoms and a carboxyl group [2]. This structure enables them to chelate with metal cations, such as Na+ and K+, and protons to form neutral coordination compounds, which cross the cell membrane and subsequently change ion gradients and osmotic pressures, thus resulting in cell death [1]. Salinomycin, a polyether antibiotic produced by Streptomyces albus DSM41398 and its derived strains [3], is widely applied in husbandry because it has properties that kill Gram-positive bacteria and coccidia [4]. Recent studies have found that salinomycin also inhibits the growth of leukemia stem cells [5] and epithelial cancer stem cells [6], indicating that it is a potential anti-tumor drug [6]. The high-titer Streptomyces albus strain BK3-25 produces 18 g/L salinomycin under lab conditions [7], but the intracellular accumulation of salinomycin poses a threat to cell growth, which can be released by the strain’s resistance ability [8,9,10]. However, the mechanism underlying this antibiotic resistance remains elusive. According to our previous work, SLNHY_261 (slnTII) and SLNHY_262 (slnTI) in a salinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), encoding the ATP-binding subunit and transmembrane subunit, respectively [11], were thought to form an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) complex participating in salinomycin export. When slnTI and slnTII were deleted in Streptomyces albus XM 211, the salinomycin titers of the corresponding mutants declined by only 27.2% and 45.4%, respectively [12], indicating that there are additional genes involved in salinomycin export, which may be located beyond the salinomycin BGC regions. Actinomycetes have large-capacity transporter protein systems, which participate in cell metabolism, intercellular communication, biosynthesis, and proliferation [13]. The ABC superfamily [14] and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) [15] are two well-studied classes of transporters. Whole-genome sequencing has illustrated that there are numerous ABC and MFS transporter genes in an actinomycetal genome both inside and outside of secondary metabolite BGCs [13,16]. Wang et al. analyzed transcriptome expression differences with expression profile chips and discovered 13 candidate transporter genes outside the natamycin BGC from Streptomyces chattanoogensis L10 [17]. Chu et al. built a step-by-step workflow based on the TCDB database BLAST, and they included substrate analysis, transporter classification analysis, and phylogenetic analysis to mine BGC-independent exporters. Together with a tunable plug-and-play exporter module with replaceable promoters and ribosome-binding sites, they realized the titer improvement of macrolide biopesticides in different Streptomyces producers [18]. Nevertheless, the current commonly used approaches are mainly sequence-dependent or based on known exporters, and the methods of BGC-independent exporter mining still need development. Soybean oil serves as the main carbon source in salinomycin fermentation, supplying energy through primary metabolism and precursors, such as malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, and ethylmalonyl-CoA, for salinomycin biosynthesis. Usually, 15% (w/v) of soybean oil is added to the fermentation medium, which is extremely high compared with other antibiotic fermentations. Our previous work revealed that increased soybean oil addition resulted in higher salinomycin production [19], and, thus, we hypothesized that higher concentrations of soybean oil cause a higher transcription of exporter genes. Herein, a strategy based on comparative transcriptomic analysis under different concentrations of soybean oil supplementation was developed to identify salinomycin exporter genes (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Our work provided universal exporters for the titer improvement of polyether antibiotics in Streptomyces. Furthermore, our method might broaden transporter engineering toolkits for the titer improvement of other valuable products in Streptomyces.
