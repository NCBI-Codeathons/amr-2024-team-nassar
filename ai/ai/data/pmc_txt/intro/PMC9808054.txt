Introduction Perylenequinones (PQs) comprise a basic 4, 9-dihydroxy-3, 10-PQ structure (Supplementary Figure S1; Daub et al., 2013). They can be substituted in position 2, by two methoxy groups, in positions 1 and 12 by a six-or seven-membered ring, or by two 2-hydroxy-or 2-acyloxy-propyl side chains, and in positions 6 and 7 by a methylenedioxy group, or by two methoxy groups (Daub et al., 2013). These PQs have been divided into four classes based on the substitutional groups (Geris et al., 2022). The PQs progresses of class A, C and D have been reviewed previously (Falk, 1999; Barnes et al., 2001; Miskovsky, 2002; Dumas et al., 2004; Saw et al., 2008; Geris et al., 2022). Therefore, this review is focused on the class B perylenequinones. In the presence of light, PQs are photoactivated and catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from singlet oxygen. Excessive ROS can disrupt the balance of cellular redox status and cause oxidative stress, thereby causing oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules, resulting in the inhibition of metabolism and cellular apoptosis in pathogenic microorganisms and cancer cells (Qi et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). Consequently, PQs have been widely applied as photosensitizers in the medical, food, cosmetic, agricultural, and material fields (Table 1; Gao et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2018).

The high demand for PQs has stimulated research into improving their production and purity, such as sequencing of the potential PQ biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs), which have served as sequence libraries for improving and diversifying PQ biosynthesis of the full range of PQs, and has improved PQ yields in many instances (Blin et al., 2017). However, no systematic review of PQs is available. To fill this gap, this comprehensive review covers progress in PQ research in three sections: (1) the sources, structural diversity, and biological activity of microbial PQs, (2) elucidation of PQ biosynthetic pathways, associated genes and mechanisms of regulation, and (3) advances in pathway engineering and future potential to modify cellular metabolism and improve PQ production.
