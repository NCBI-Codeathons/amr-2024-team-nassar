1. Introduction Acrostalagmus is a genus of ascomycete fungi in the class Sordariomycetes, order Glomerellales, family Plectosphaerellaceae. There are four species (A. annulatus, A. cf. luteoalbus, A. cf. luteoalbus CK1, A. luteoalbus) of the genus Acrostalagmus in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/data-hub/taxonomy/tree/?taxon=461148 (accessed on 27 July 2023)). The colony of Acrostalagmus is brick red, because of its red spores, with white mycelium at edge. The mass production of spores causes the overall colony to present a ring pattern with different shades. With the extension of culture time, the color gradually deepened and darkened, showing rust red [1]. Most of the fungi belonging to the genus Acrostalagmus are alkalitolerant [2,3] or alkalophilic [4] fungi, and are widely distributed in different ecological environments, including forest [5], sand ridge state [6], marine [7,8] and polar ecosystems [9]. The genus Acrostalagmus can survive in different circumstances due to its ability to produce kinds of enzymes [10,11,12] and secondary metabolites [13] with a variety of bioactivities [6,14,15]. The crude extracts of some Acrostalagmus species exhibited significant brine shrimp lethality, as well as antibacterial, antifungal and DPPH radical scavenging activities [9,16], meaning they have potential to produce abundant natural products with remarkable activities. Gas chromatography mass (GC-MS) [17], high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS [18], and ultra-HPLC-MS/MS spectrometry [9] have been used to analyze the secondary metabolites of the genus Acrostalagmus and further demonstrate the great ability of this genus to produce bioactive compounds. To date, there has been no summary reviewing the natural products of the Acrostalagmus genus. In consideration of the above-mentioned facts, the chemical structure types, sources, distribution, biological activities, and biological synthesis of the compounds isolated from Acrostalagmus from 1969 to 2022 are comprehensively reviewed in this paper.
