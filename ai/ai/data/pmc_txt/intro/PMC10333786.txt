Introduction The mechanisms by which bacteria acquire resistance to antimicrobial agents can be classified into four types: inactivation of antimicrobial agents by degradation or chemical modification; antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to a change in the antimicrobial target, in which the site of antimicrobial action is mutated in the bacteria; drug resistance due to changes in membrane permeability; mechanisms that cause bacteria to become resistant by actively exporting antimicrobials and reducing their intracellular concentrations [1]. The first two mechanisms confer resistance to specific or the same class of antibiotics, while the latter two mechanisms increase resistance to a variety of structurally unrelated antibiotics. In many clinically isolated multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, multiple mechanisms are present in the same strain, causing bacterial resistance to many drugs. Because a single multidrug efflux pump can export many structurally unrelated substrates, the elevated expression of even one pump can cause bacteria to become resistant to many compounds. Bacterial drug efflux pumps can be classified into the following seven families based on their energy utilization and structural aspects: (1) the major facilitator superfamily (MFS); (2) the resistance–nodulation–division (RND) superfamily; (3) the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family; (4) the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily; (5) the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family; (6) the proteobacterial antimicrobial compound efflux (PACE) family; and (7) the p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate transporter (AbgT) family [2–6]. Drug efflux pumps, named because of their involvement in bacterial drug resistance, have been conserved across bacterial species since before humans used antimicrobial agents [7, 8]. These efflux pumps may have been necessary to counter competition among heterologous bacteria in the environment with antibiotic-producing microbes [9]. Additionally, drug efflux pumps play a fundamental role in survival in various natural environments, including host environments. In particular, RND-type efflux pumps are of interest because of their many functions: pH tolerance and resistance to toxic natural products, metal ions, bile acids, fatty acids and antimicrobial peptides produced by host cells. These RND-type pumps are coupled to an outer membrane protein (OMP), bridged together by periplasmic adaptor proteins (PAPs). Multidrug efflux pumps are also involved in biofilm formation. As 90 % of naturally occurring bacteria form biofilms, which are involved in causing clinically significant infections in host cells, including in humans, the impact of efflux pumps on biofilm formation and drug resistance is immense. Furthermore, several bacterial species perform intercellular communication through quorum sensing. Although quorum sensing signals (QSSs) accumulate in proportion to cell density, efflux pumps also play an essential role in regulating quorum sensing processes. This review summarizes the drug resistance and physiological roles of RND multidrug efflux pumps in 

Salmonella enterica

 (Fig. 1), 

Escherichia coli

 (Fig. 4) and 

Pseudomonas aeruginosa

 (Fig. 5). We focus on these three bacteria because they are clinically important in human coexistence and because the characteristics of their RND multidrug efflux pumps have been studied in more experiments than those of other species. A phylogenetic comparison between all 26 RND-type efflux pumps mentioned in this review can be seen in Fig. 2 and their sequences are in Table S1 (available in the online version of this article).

The three main clusters are the MexI/W-family, the TriC/HME and heterotrimeric-like pumps and the homotrimeric pumps. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using Kalign v3 [146], and the tree was made with iTol [147]. HME, heavy metal efflux subfamily; Pa,
