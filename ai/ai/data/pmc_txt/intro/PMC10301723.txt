Introduction: Streptomyces-plant interactions and their role in crop protection Microbial biocontrol offers an attractive ‘green’ alternative to widely used synthetic chemicals in the management of plant diseases and weeds, and there is a long history of bioprospecting for novel biocontrol strains (Barratt et al., 2018; Collinge et al., 2022). A microbial biological control agent (MBCA) is defined as a microorganism – or its natural products – used to combat pests, weeds, and diseases. MBCAs can function through one or more modes of action, (Collinge et al., 2022). These include competition for nutrients and space, parasitism, host-induced resistance, or antibiosis through the action of antimicrobial specialised metabolites, hydrolytic enzymes, or phytotoxins (Köhl et al., 2019; Boro et al., 2022). Differing modes of action can be delivered through individual microbes, with varying specificity and efficacy towards individual pathogens, or alternatively, brought together in assembled microbial consortia (Mukherjee et al., 2013; Fira et al., 2018; Mukhopadhyay and Kumar, 2020; Blake et al., 2021; Boro et al., 2022). The association of multiple MBCAs leads to combined modes of action that can act synergistically, providing more effective disease control than individual microbes (Bahkali et al., 2014; Minchev et al., 2021). Recent studies highlight that the strategic combination and deployment of multiple modes of action should be considered to overcome current gaps in the design of microbial inoculants for crop protection. Identifying the ecological function and chemical diversity of microbial specialised metabolites is essential to predict synergistic interactions in biocontrol consortia and during host microbiome assembly. Members of the Streptomyces genus are of great interest as microbial inoculants due to their extensive secondary metabolism, producing over 70% of the natural products currently used in medicine and agriculture (Alam et al., 2022). In the field of plant health, Streptomyces spp. can exhibit beneficial functional traits through the production of specialised metabolites that enhance nutrient uptake, promote plant growth, alleviate abiotic stress, induce resistance, and prevent pathogen or pest invasion and establishment through nematicidal or insecticidal activities (Barka et al., 2016; Rey and Dumas, 2017; Newitt et al., 2019; O’Sullivan et al., 2021a; Park et al., 2023). Although predominantly associated with beneficial relationships, a small group of Streptomyces can produce phytotoxins and show pathogenic characteristics towards plants (Rey and Dumas, 2017; Alam et al., 2022). Several products containing Streptomyces microbial cells, or their purified metabolites, have been commercialised as biocontrol agents (Viaene et al., 2016; Rey and Dumas, 2017; Shi et al., 2020; Collinge et al., 2022). A non-exhaustive list of Streptomyces-derived specialised metabolites, which have been tested on live plants with a view to controlling plant disease, is shown in 
Table 1
. The development of new biological control products is based on our ability to detect them within complex systems and confirm their bioactivity using sufficiently tailored screening methods. For example, many bioactivity screens and observable phenotypes will only detect the most abundant and/or most bioactive specialised metabolites. Compounding this issue, specialised metabolites produced by MBCAs in vitro are often much higher in concentration than levels produced in plant associations or in soil (reviewed in Köhl et al., 2019). Thus, better screening tools are required to place microbial specialised metabolite discovery and function into an ecological context.

In this review, we focus on the Streptomyces specialised metabolites that mediate host interactions with pathogens or host associated communities. We focus on the discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo analysis of Streptomyces biocontrol agents. This review brings together the disciplines of biocontrol and microbial ecology to compare metabolites produced by MBCAs and the range of novel specialised metabolites found in plant microbiomes which are yet to be characterised, and how these metabolites can be exploited for plant health and post-harvest applications. Finally, we highlight some of the challenges and new approaches used for in vivo metabolite characterisation such as the use of biosensors, and novel culturing techniques for the discovery, deployment, and manipulation of Streptomyces and their specialised metabolites for plant protection.
