INTRODUCTION Signal transduction is the process through which microorganisms regulate their cellular programs according to their extracellular environment. Microorganisms are known to transduce information from outside the cell to the cytoplasm via two-component and one-component signal transduction systems (1, 2). Two-component signal transduction cascades are typically composed of a membrane localized sensor histidine kinase that, when stimulated, transfers a phosphate to a soluble response regulator, resulting in a cellular response (1–3). In contrast, one-component signal transduction systems are composed of a single protein that both directly detects a stimulus and modulates a cellular response (1–3). The vast majority of signal transduction systems in bacteria are one-component systems with most harboring DNA-binding domains and thereby controlling gene expression (2). A majority of one-component regulators are predicted to be localized within the cytoplasm, presumably to have unimpeded access to their DNA target(s) (2). Nonetheless, there are known examples of one-component regulators that are localized to the cytoplasmic membrane (Table 1). Here, we define these one-component regulators and those with similar features (i.e., the presence of a predicted transmembrane [TM] region and a predicted DNA-binding domain) as TM transcription regulators (TTRs). Functional TTRs are found in bacteria and archaea, but not in eukaryotes, due to the separation of the cytoplasmic membrane and their genomes by the nucleus (2, 4, 5). Within archaea, TTRs are known to regulate motility and pilin gene expression in response to dangerous temperatures and nutrient-limiting conditions (6, 7). TTRs are better studied in bacteria, where they have been shown to regulate bile salt resistance (8, 9), toxin production (10, 11), antibiotic resistance (12, 13), acid resistance (14–16), natural competence (17), pilin/fimbria expression (18–24), type 3 secretion systems (25, 26), biofilm formation (27, 28), and metabolism (29–31), and have been implicated in modulation of the human immune system (32) (see Table 1 for additional details).

Localization to the cytoplasmic membrane has been shown to be critical for some TTRs to influence expression of their target genes (33). TTRs are counterintuitive as their subcellular localization reduces their diffusion and thereby their ability to bind target promoter(s). However, there is a possibility that TTRs evolved from two-component systems. It is known that in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a two-component system consisting of PilS, the membrane localized histidine kinase, and PilR, the response regulator, regulates activity of RpoN (24). The Neisseria gonorrhoeae genome encodes a chimeric protein called Rsp, which includes the membrane localized receptor of PilS at its N terminus and the PilR DNA-binding domain at its C termini and represses pilA expression (34). Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a constituent of the human microbiota, contains 32 hybrid histidine kinases, each with a DNA-binding domain within its genome (35). To gain a deeper understanding of TTRs, we performed a large-scale genomic analysis of TTRs across archaeal and bacterial species.
