1. Introduction Ansamitocin P-3 (AP-3) is an important antitumor agent with potent activity against various cancer cell lines [1,2]. Since 2012, AP-3 has been used as the ‘warhead’ molecule of the currently commercialized antibody-conjugated (ADC) drug trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for the treatment of breast cancer [3]. T-DM1 is also under clinical trials for the treatment of HER2-positive lung cancer [4]. In eukaryotic cells, binding of AP-3 on β-tubulin inhibits microtubule assembly and chromosome segregation during the interphase and mitotic phase resulting in cell apoptosis [5]. AP-3 has a strong interaction with β-tubulin with a dissociation constant (KD) of 1.3 ± 0.7 µM [5]. In a high-resolution crystal structure of tubulin in complex with maytansine, an AP-3 analogue [6], it was found that binding of maytansine interferes the interaction of longitudinal tubulin in microtubule assembly. The identified maytansine-binding site is distinct from the vinblastine-binding site, and is also shown as the common binding site of a rhizoxin variant and PM060184 [6]. Since tubulin is not present in bacterial cells, the intracellular targets of AP-3 in bacteria are still unknown. The cell division protein FtsZ has been shown to have similar function and architecture with tubulin [7,8,9]. Both FtsZ and tubulin work as cytoskeletons and form filaments with GTP hydrolysis [10,11]. Several compounds, such as curcumin, taxanes and plumbagin, are found to inhibit the function of tubulin as well as FtsZ [9]. Whether AP-3 is also an inhibitor of FtsZ remained to be studied. As an important drug precursor, various strategies have been applied to improve AP-3 yield [12,13,14,15,16,17]. Previously in our lab, a high-yield AP-3 producing strain Actinosynnema pretiosum NXJ-24 was constructed by engineering the post-modification steps, which resulted in a 5-fold increase in AP-3 yield to 246 mg/L [14]. However, the AP-3 yield could not be further improved despite several attempts, suggesting a cell inhibition or toxicity effect caused by high concentrations of AP-3. In this study, the cell toxicity of AP-3 against its producing strain was observed and investigated. The interaction of AP-3 with FtsZ was validated by SPR biosensor analysis, in vitro assembly assay and docking analysis. Further overexpression of FtsZ improved the resistance of the resulting strain and the yield of AP-3 as well.
