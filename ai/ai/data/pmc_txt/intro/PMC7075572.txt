Introduction Fungi in the genus Cercospora cause devastating crop losses on a wide range of crop plants world-wide including sugar beet, corn, and coffee as well as many vegetable and ornamental species [1]. The wide host range and lack of disease resistance in many host species has been attributed to the fungus’ production of a photoactivated perylenequinone toxin, cercosporin (for review see [2–4]). Cercosporin is a photosensitizing compound that absorbs light energy to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) as well as other reactive oxygen species (ROS) [5–8]. In host plants the cercosporin-generated ROS cause peroxidation of the host cell membrane lipids, leading to membrane breakdown, death of host cells and leakage of nutrients needed by the fungus for tissue colonization [9–11]. Studies in several Cercospora-host systems have documented the importance of cercosporin in disease by documenting reductions in disease development by mutants deficient for cercosporin production [12–17]. The importance of light, required for cercosporin photoactivation, in disease symptom development has also been documented in both coffee and sugar beet [18, 19]. Singlet oxygen is a non-radical, but highly reactive species of ROS [4]. Unlike free-radical forms of ROS such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen is not a common part of cellular reactions, and most cells lack effective resistance mechanisms. Compounds have been identified that quench singlet oxygen [20]. Carotenoids are among the most effective quenchers of singlet oxygen, and play a role in defense against singlet oxygen generated as part of photosynthesis [21]. But there is little evidence for a role for quenchers in resistance to photosensitizer toxicity in cells [3]. Consistent with its production of singlet oxygen, cercosporin has been shown to be almost universally toxic, with toxicity documented not only to plants, but also to mice, bacteria, oomycetes, and many fungi [8, 22]. Although cercosporin has been shown to be almost universally toxic, Cercospora species are resistant to its toxicity [22]. Thus, extensive studies have been conducted to characterize autoresistance mechanisms in Cercospora fungi as a strategy to identify genes that may have utility in engineering cercosporin-resistant plants. Characterization of endogenous quenchers including carotenoids, as well as antioxidant enzymes and general antioxidant activity were not correlated with cercosporin resistance in fungi (for review see [3, 23]). Vitamin B6 production was correlated with autoresistance, however expression of Cercospora B6 biosynthetic genes (PDX1, PDX2) in tobacco did not elevate B6 levels or cercosporin resistance due to down-regulation of the endogenous tobacco PDX genes [24]. Identification of the zinc cluster transcription factor CRG1 that regulates cercosporin resistance and production [25] led to the recovery of putative resistance genes through the use of a subtractive hybridization strategy of genes differentially expressed between the wild type strain and a crg1 mutant [26]. Differentially regulated genes identified through this strategy have subsequently been characterized for a possible role in resistance through characterization of mutants [27] as well as by the ability to impart cercosporin resistance to the cercosporin-sensitive fungus Neurospora crassa [28, 29]. Another strategy for engineering resistance is to use host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) with RNA interference (RNAi) to silence expression of critical pathogenicity genes. The utility of HIGS to protect plants against fungal pathogens was first demonstrated by Nowara et al. [30] with the obligate powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis. It has since been shown to function against fungi with diverse modes of pathogenicity, including other obligate pathogens such as rusts [31], as well as species of Fusarium [32], Verticillium [33], and Sclerotinia [34] (for review see [35]). The biosynthetic pathway for cercosporin production has been characterized. The polyketide synthase (PKS) in the pathway was first identified through recovery from cercosporin-deficient mutants of C. nicotianae created by restriction enzyme-mediated insertion (REMI) [13]. Other genes in the pathway were then identified through sequencing of flanking regions. This work identified a cluster of eight genes (CTB1-CTB8) encoding methyltransferases, oxidoreductases, a transporter, and a transcription factor in addition to the PKS [36]. In addition, a recent genomic study of C. beticola found five additional loci flanking the cluster (CTB9-12) that have a role in biosynthesis [37]. Characterization of cluster genes has led to the identification of the metabolic intermediates involved in cercosporin production [38]. Here we report on the transformation of tobacco to express three autoresistance genes (ATR1, CFP, and 71cR) identified through our subtractive hybridization work with the crg1 mutant [26], as well as silencing constructs targeting the CTB1 and CTB8 genes in the biosynthetic pathway [36]. ATR1 encodes an ABC transporter involved in both cercosporin production and autoresistance [27]. CFP, also identified through our subtractive hybridization study, encodes an MFS transporter that was previously identified as a light-induced gene involved in both cercosporin production and resistance [12]. Significantly, the C. beticola genomic study cited above identified CFP as among the flanking loci to the CTB cluster that have a role in cercosporin biosynthesis [37]. Transformation of CFP into ‘Xanthi’ tobacco has been previously reported to reduce lesion size caused by C. nicotianae [39]. The gene 71cR encodes a hypothetical protein that has been shown to impart cercosporin resistance when expressed in N. crassa [29]. Efforts to silence the pathway utilized CTB1, encoding the polyketide synthase, the first step in the biosynthetic pathway [13], as well as CTB8, the pathway regulator [36].
