Introduction Marine Streptomyces sp. BRA-346, isolated from the Brazilian endemic tunicate Euherdmania sp., produces epoxyketone peptides, such as dihydroeponemycin (DHE, 1), eponemycin (EPN, 2), dihydro TMC-86A (DH-TMC, 3), and TMC-86A (TMC, 4; Figure 1). Both DHE and an epoxyketone-containing enriched fraction were evaluated by Furtado et al. (2021) in glioma cell lines, displaying high cytotoxicity to HOG and T98G cells (GI50 of 1.6 and 1.7 ng/ml for DHE, and 17.6 and 28.2 ng/ml for the BRA-346 fraction, respectively). The enriched fraction inhibited the proteasome ChTL activity with IC50 of 45 ng/ml (Furtado et al., 2021). Additional studies showed that the epoxyketone-containing fraction (at GI50 levels) led to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and upregulation of genes related to ER-stress response, correlating to the observed proteasome inhibition. DHE alone induced similar effects in treated cells, but at concentrations 25 times its GI50, suggesting that the other epoxyketone compounds contained in Streptomyces sp. BRA-346 samples might boost proteasome inhibition and further cellular effects in glioma cells. These findings reinforced the potential of these marine bacteria in producing a cocktail of structurally related compounds that affect the viability of glioma cells through proteasome inhibition.

The proteasome is an enzymatic protein complex of ~750 kDa, which is responsible for non-lysosomal cell proteolysis. Natural and synthetic molecules have been shown to selectively inhibit the proteasome, especially its chymotrypsin-like catalytic activity. These proteasome inhibitors selectively kill cancer cells by promoting protein stress and inducing apoptosis in highly replicating and protein synthesis active cells (reviewed by Kisselev et al., 2012). Proteasome inhibitors were first approved for treating multiple myeloma (MM) and still represent one of the best alternatives for treating MM (Moreau et al., 2012; Hungria et al., 2019; Ito, 2020). More recently, proteasome inhibitors are also being repositioned to solid tumors (Roeten et al., 2018) as glioblastoma (Huang et al., 2017; Roth et al., 2020), and breast cancer (Jones et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016a; Weyburne et al., 2017). Peptide epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors such as the natural eponemycin (Sugawara et al., 1990; Meng et al., 1999), epoxomicin (Hanada et al., 1992; Kyung et al., 1999; Groll et al., 2000), carmaphycin (Pereira et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013; Trivella et al., 2014), and the synthetic approved drug carfilzomib (Fostier et al., 2012) inhibit the proteasome with high potency and selectivity. They are irreversible inhibitors of the three proteasome proteolytic activities. DHE (1), EPN (2), and further analogs were found in BRA-346 cultures, from which the crude extract and an enriched fraction showed potent proteasome and cancer cell growth inhibition (IC50 < 20 ng/ml; Furtado et al., 2021). The diversity of eponemycin analogs found in BRA-346 cultures stimulated further investigation on their biosynthesis and regulation. Compound production by bacteria can be tightly regulated. It is estimated that less than 10% of the bacterial genome capacity is expressed under laboratory conditions (Rutledge and Challis, 2015; Liu et al., 2021). This is due to BGC expression regulation by specific BGC regulators (Fuqua et al., 1994; Santos et al., 2012; Rajput and Kumar, 2017) and also by broader epigenetic modulation (Trivella and de Felicio, 2018; Tomm et al., 2019). The “one strain many compounds” (OSMAC) approach, originally introduced by Bode et al. (2002) and recently reviewed by Pan et al. (2019), has shown that chemical elicitation of bacterial cultures by epigenetic modulators, as HDAC inhibitors (Moore et al., 2012), co-cultivation, culture media, and specialized metabolites, as antibiotics, can induce the production of bacterial metabolites, including the production of rare compounds (Bode et al., 2002; Abdelmohsen et al., 2015; de Felício et al., 2021). In addition, genome mining and BGC cloning have provided alternative approaches for controlling and overproduction of bacterial secondary metabolites under laboratory conditions (Rigali et al., 2018; Mukherji et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021), for example, by deletion of the negative regulators from the cloned BGC (Yamanaka et al., 2014). Here, we show that epoxyketone peptides production by BRA-346 is modulated by growth conditions and chemical elicitors and can be overexpressed in a heterologous host. BRA-346 can produce a variety of epoxyketone peptides and other classes of secondary metabolites that are also regulated under laboratory conditions. The production of the target compound DHE (1) and structurally related analogues, such as DH-TMC (3) and TMC-86A (4), could be upregulated by the fungal antibiotic ampicillin, used as a chemical elicitor, and culture media containing high salt concentrations and soluble starch as the carbohydrate source. On the other hand, epoxyketone peptide production by BRA-346 is downregulated when other specialized metabolites are produced by this bacterium. The biosynthetic gene cluster coding for BRA-346 epoxyketone peptides was located by mining the draft genome of BRA-346, also revealing additional BGCs and a complex repertory of regulatory systems coded in the genome of this bacterium. The epn/tmc BGC was cloned into the “antibiotic null” Streptomyces coelicolor M1146, showing overproduction of epoxyketone peptides compared to the wild-type organism and the plasticity of the epn/tmc BGC of BRA-346 in producing a variety of epoxyketone peptides congeners, including 1, 3 and 4, and further obtaining eponemycin (2). Phylogenetic analyses of the epn/tmc BGC give further insights on the preference for 2 or 4 biosynthesis and reveal horizontal gene transfer of this BGC. In addition, a variety of transcription regulators in phylogenetically related BGCs, point this BGC might be tightly regulated at the transcription and translational levels. In particular, in BRA-346, and in close related BGCs, a LuxR transcription factor was found. The BRA-346 LuxR predicted protein shows an N-terminal PAS-regulatory domain, suggesting an additional sensor regulating the epn/tmc BGC transcription in Streptomyces BRA-346. The data presented here shows the wild type BRA-346 can produce epoxyketone peptides and a myriad of natural products, being the secondary metabolism tightly regulated by complex regulatory systems, which are in turn influenced by culture media, chemical elicitors and potentially redox balance and aeration. Gamma-butyrolactones (GBL) systems and TetR repressors present in other BGCs coded by the BRA-346 genome appear to be regulated in an opposite direction as the epn/tmc BGC, competing with this biosynthetic pathway in the wild-type organism. Biosynthetic precursor competition appears as the main factor controlling BRA-346 specialized metabolome expression, although quorum sensing crosstalk cannot be ruled out. In addition to the heterologous expression of BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC in “antibiotic null” strains as S. coelicolor M1146, eventual artificial control of its LuxR transcription factor are alternatives for further improving biotechnological production of epoxyketone peptides encoded by the epn/tmc BGC.
