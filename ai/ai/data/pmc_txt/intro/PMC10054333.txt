1. Introduction Cancer poses a severe threat to humans, and its resulting economic burden may increase in the future [1,2]. Although cancer incidence and fatality rates may recede due to early diagnosis, the treatment cost remains unaffordable for most patients [3]. To address this issue, researchers are gearing up to develop efficient antitumor medicines, and impressive advancements have been achieved in this regard. Extant antitumor medicines are roughly divided into eight categories, including alkylating agents [4], hormone antagonists [5], antimetabolites, cytotoxic antibiotics [6], plant alkaloids [7], platinum compounds [8], protein kinase inhibitors [9], and monoclonal antibodies [10]. Belonging to cytotoxic antibiotics, anthracycline antitumor agents have been widely used for the clinical treatment of cancer for half a century. Of the reported anthracycline antitumor agents, aclacinomycin (ACM), also known as aclarubicin (ACL), is actually the mixture of ACM-A, ACM-B, and ACM-Y, typically synthesized by Streptomyces galilaeus ATCC 31133 [11,12]. ACM-A manifests a long side-chain structure, in which three sugar residues, including L-rhodosamine, 2-deoxyfucose, and L-cinerulose A, are tethered to aklavinone. As an anticancer medicine used in Japan and China, ACM-A exhibits remarkable inhibitory activities against leukemias, gastric cancer, and lung cancer [13,14,15,16]. In principle, anthracyclines exhibit antitumor activity due to the targeting of the minor groove of DNA to form a stable complex [17] (Figure 1). This reversible targeting can repress topoisomerase II and therefore hamper the transcription and replication of DNA in this complex. Consequently, double-stranded DNA unwinds and the accumulated DNA fragments, triggering programmed cell death [18]. ACM-A was also found to evict histones and damage chromatin [19,20]. Compared to doxorubicin (DXR) and daunorubicin (DNR), the two anthracyclines isolated from Streptomyces peucetius ATCC 27952, ACM-A exhibits higher antitumor activity but much lower cardiotoxicity [21]. The chemical synthesis of ACM-A is challenging due to its bulky and complex structure. Aklavinone is an important member of tetrahydronaphthol whose benzylic hydroxy group can be easily eliminated. In previously reported synthesis, Dielsâ€“Alder reactions were found to be crucial for the synthesis of aklavinone, which raised the issue of regioselectivity [22,23]. It was reported that refinement led to only a 68% yield ratio of oligosaccharides in ACM-A [24,25]. Clearly, high stereoselectivity is desired, but the modulation of stereoselectivity is laborious and troublesome [26]. Although strategies have been developed (e.g., donor-controlled stereoselectivity), the multi-step syntheses of ACM-A is tedious and seems to be inevitable [27,28]. In addition, the organic synthesis of ACM-A shows shortcomings such as the need for toxic catalysts, low yield, and severe pollution [29]. In contrast, the bioproduction of ACM-A shows merits such as low cost, easy manipulation, and less environmental pollution. ACM-A is mainly obtained by the fermentation of Streptomyces sp.NO.MA144-MI ATCC 31133 or its mutants. Of reported Sreptomyces species, Streptomyces lavendofoliae is the most employed for the industrial production of ACM-A [30]. Since ACM-A is a secondary metabolite and indirectly produced from the core metabolic pathways in Streptomyces, its production is therefore low and needs to be substantially enhanced. Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering raise the hope for the high-level production of ACM-A based on rational design and the subsequent construction of biological systems. In this review, we not only outline the reported biosynthetic pathways of ACM-A, but also discuss the catalytic mechanisms of key enzymes. Furthermore, we come up with protocols for the overproduction of this economically important medicine.
