1. Introduction Plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites, that indirectly participate on their physiological growth, regulating the interactions between plants and their environment, through various functions such as defense against pests, herbivores and phytopathogens [1]. For humans, these secondary metabolites could be used as bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals of anti-microbial, antioxidant and anticancer activity [2]. Secondary metabolites include terpenoids, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, sulfur and nitrogen-containing compounds [3]. Approximately 50% of the most effective drugs are derived from natural products [4]. Plant terpenoids such as Taxol, sterols, gibberellins and carotenoids are implemented in commercial and pharmaceutical industries. Taxol has been reputed as the most effective anticancer drug with more than 15 billion dollars annual sale by the pharmaceutical industry [5]. Taxol is one of the most clinically valuable terpenoids since its discovery in 1970 from the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia [6]. It has been recognized as blockbuster anticancer compound, the most successful broad range drug against proliferation of numerous cancers such as breast, ovarian and AIDS-related sarcoma; it has been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994 [7]. Taxol has a unique mode of action by binding to β-tubulin, promoting the microtubule assembly and disrupting the mitotic division of the target cells [8]. The current approaches for Taxol production are; 1- Natural sources from the bark of T. brevifolia (most productive source), however, the yield of taxol based on this approach was ranged from 0.001–0.05%, thus for producing of one gram purified Taxol it need about 8–10 kg of plant bark, which collected from about 4 to 5 plants [9]. However, the scarce availability and higher vulnerability of this plant to unpredicted fluctuation with the ecological and environmental conditions [10] are the challenges for this source [3,11,12,13]. 2-Semisynthetic process via 10-decaetylbaccatin III intermediate from the needles of T. baccata is the current approach for taxol production [14,15], however, the lower yield of this intermediate, selectivity over unwanted byproducts, heterogeneity, reproducibility, in addition to the epigenetic and mutational changes of T. baccata are the current hurdles [16,17]. 3-Endophytic fungi from Taxus spp. opened a new avenue for industrial Taxol production due to their fast growth, cost effectiveness, independence on climatic changes and feasibility for genetic manipulation [18,19]. Taxomyces andreanae was the first reported Taxol producer endophyte from Taxus spp. [18]. More than 150 fungal endophytes were identified from T. baccata and about 10% of this population has the potentiality to produce Taxol [20]. However, the anticipation of endophytic fungi for industrial Taxol production has been challenged by the loss of Taxol productivity with multiple subculturing [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. Downregulation of the expression of Taxol genes upon subculturing of the endophytic fungi was reported frequently [29]. Thus, searching for novel fungal saprophytes having a stable molecular machinery system for conceivable production of Taxol independently is the ultimate objective for biotechnologists [22,30].
