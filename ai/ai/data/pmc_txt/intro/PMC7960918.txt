Introduction Surfactin was firstly isolated in 1968 by Arima et al. as a new biologically active compound produced by Bacillus with surfactant activities, leading to its appellation. Its structure was elucidated firstly through its amino acid sequence (Kakinuma et al., 1969a) and then its fatty acid chain (Kakinuma et al., 1969b). Surfactin was thus characterized as a lipopeptide composed of a heptapeptide with the following sequence: L-Glu1-L-Leu2-D-Leu3-L-Val4-L-Asp5-D-Leu6-L-Leu7, forming a lactone ring structure with a Î²-hydroxy fatty acid chain. Bearing both, a hydrophilic peptide portion and a lipophilic fatty acid chain, surfactin is of amphiphilic nature, leading to exceptional biosurfactant activities and diverse biological activities. Surfactins are actually considered as a family of lipopeptides, sharing common structural traits with a great structural diversity due to the type of amino acids in the peptide chain and the length and isomery of the lipidic chain (Ongena and Jacques, 2008). More than one thousand variants can potentially be naturally synthesized. This remarkable biodiversity mainly results from their biosynthetic mechanism. This review is composed of 4 main sections. At first, a detailed description of the biosynthesis mechanisms will allow to understand origin of the biodiversity. Secondly, the diversity of variants will be seen, as well as its enhancement possibilities. Thirdly, the link between surfactin's varying structure and its properties and activities will be described. Lastly, the production process and its optimisation will be discussed, either for the whole surfactin family or for specific variants.
