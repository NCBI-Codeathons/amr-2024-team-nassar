1. Introduction Angucyclines are by far the largest group of aromatic polyketides solely produced by actinobacteria [1,2]. These natural products have diverse biological activities, including antibacterial, anticancer, antiviral, enzyme inhibitory, fungicidal, and others. Angucyclines are assembled by the repetitive condensation of malonyl-CoA to produce a common benz[a]anthracene intermediate [2]. This reaction is performed by type II polyketide synthase enzymes. Two pathways to form the benz[a]anthracene aglycone of angucyclines exist. In most cases, the initial decaketide chain undergoes a series of cyclizations and aromatizations dictated by cyclases/aromatases to produce an angular core structure [3]. This major route takes place in the biosynthesis of vineomycins [4], jadomycins [5], and landomycins [6], for example. However, at least in two cases, BE-7585A and PD116198, the polyketide chain is folded into an anthracyclinone intermediate that further undergoes oxidative A-ring opening and rearrangement into an angular benz[a]anthracene structure [7,8]. The first common benz[a]anthracene intermediate for both routes, UWM6, can be preserved or further modified by a series of oxidation and reduction events and decorated by extensive glycosylation or other modifications [2]. Glycosylation is a distinctive feature of many angucyclines sharing a common aglycone structure. The length and composition of oligosaccharide chains have a strong impact on biological activities [9]. Saquayamycins are a large group of angucyclines that, together with urdamycins, derive from the aquayamycin-type aglycone (Figure 1) [10]. More than ten derivatives of saquayamycins are known that mainly differ by the glycosylation pattern [4,11,12,13,14,15]. The largest representative of this group of natural products, saquayamycin Z, contains nine sugars [16]. Vineomycins and grincamycins as well as recently discovered Sch 47554–47555 and saprolmycins A–E also possess an aquayamycin-type aglycone [17,18]. Several other natural products have a modified aquayamycin-like aglycone structure, namely moromycins A and B and N05WA963 A–C, that lack the angular hydroxyl groups at positions 4a and 12b, resulting in a fully aromatic ring B [19,20]. N05WA963 A–C possesses an additional methoxy group at C-5. Lastly, several natural products with an opened ring A are known to derive directly from aquayamycin-type angucyclines. These include fridamycins A–E, himalomycins A and B, vineomycin B2, amicenomycins A, and the recently discovered vineomycin D [21,22,23]. It is still under discussion if these compounds are true naturally occurring products of biosynthetic pathways or are derived from the acid hydrolysis of respective angucyclines [21,24,25,26,27]. The distinct feature of the aquayamycin-type angucyclines is the presence of oligosaccharide chains attached at positions C-9 and C-3 (Figure 1). Typically, the first sugar at the C-9 position is C-linked d-olivose as in the case of saquayamycins, vineomycins, moromycins, grincamycins and N05WA963 A–C. At the same time, saquayamycins, vineomycins, moromycins, and grincamycins at C-3 have O-glycosidically attached l-rhodinose. N05WA963 A–C do not have a saccharide chain at C-3 [20]. Differences in the length and composition of the attached oligosaccharide chains determine the variety of aquayamycin-type angucyclines. Saquayamycins (except saquayamycin Z) and moromycins have diverse disaccharides at C-3 and C-9 [11,15,19]. Grincamycins and vineomycins have a trisaccharide at C-9 consisting of d-olivose, l-rhodinose and the ketosugar l-aculose or l-cinerulose (aculose derivative) [14,21]. A similar glycosylation pattern was observed in saprolmycins A–E with either trisaccharide or disaccharide at C-9 and l-aculose or l-cinerulose as a first and the only sugar at the C-3 position [18]. Sch 47554 and Sch 47555 also contain l-aculose at C-3 but carry C-bound d-amicetose (stereoisomer of rhodinose) at C-9 extended with either l-amicetose or l-aculose [17]. Lastly, amicenomycins A and B have the trisaccharide l-amicetose-l-amicetose-l-rhodinose at C-3 and a single d-olivose at C-9 [22]. As can be seen, despite the common aglycone, aquayamycin-type angucyclines represent a diverse group of natural products due to differences in the glycosylation pattern. The glycosylation events are well studied in the case of saquayamycin Z and saquayamycins G-K [16,28]. The saquayamycins G–K biosynthetic gene cluster (sqn) contains three genes sqnGT1–3 encoding glycosyltransferases. However, only SqnGT2 was shown to be essential for decorating the aglycone, while the other two, SqnGT1 and SqnGT3, are proposed to act as chaperons, modulating the SqnGT2 activity [28]. Similarly, the Sch 47554 and Sch 47555 biosynthetic gene cluster also encode three glycosyltransferases (schS7, schS9 and schS10) [29]. Genetic studies have shown that SchS7 attaches d-amicetose at C-9 and SchS9 further extends the saccharide chain when SchS10 attaches l-aculose at C-3 position [30]. Gene clusters for saprolmycins (spr) and grincamycins (gcn) biosynthesis have been recently cloned and were found to contain three genes encoding glycosyltransferases [27,31]. This implies that the different decoration pattern of these angucyclines results from the differences in functional properties of the glycosylation enzymes. Here we report the characterization of the new aquayamycin-type angucycline antibiotics baikalomycins A–C produced by Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A. The strain was isolated from the Lake Baikal endemic gastropod Benedictia baicalensis. Baikalomycins demonstrated moderate anticancer and antibacterial activities. The genome sequencing and mining led to identification of a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of baikalomycins. Heterologous expression and gene deletion experiments supported this finding and provided hints on the glycosylation steps in baikalomycins biosynthesis.
