Introduction Metabolic syndrome (MS) may be defined as a cluster of signs that increases the risk to develop diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), cardiovascular disease and some types of cancer. The cardinal signs of this condition are abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia with altered fasting glucose levels. Clinical diagnostic is determined when three or more of these signs are present [1]. In the last years there has been a growing interest to study the relationship between MS and psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. However, the results obtained so far have been rather contradictory. Carroll and colleagues [2] showed evidence for a positive association between general anxiety disorder and MS within a large population of male US veterans from the Vietnam War. Likewise, Weiss et al. (2011) [3] found that post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] is associated with increased rates of MS within an african-american urban population. More recently, Albert et al., [4] using a cross-sectional approximation, found that the prevalence of MS in a sample of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is higher than those reported in the Italian general population. Additionally, in the last year, Tang and collaborators reported that anxiety has a significant positive association with MS using a meta-analytic approach [5]. In contrast with these findings, Hildrum et al., [6] did not find an association between anxiety and MS in a Norwegian cohort. Furthermore, in 2011, Linnville and collaborators [7] stated that the overall prevalence of MS was the same in repatriated prisoners of the Vietnam War with and without PTSD in comparison with a control group. Thus, it is clear that the information generated from human studies is not enough to clarify whether or not exists a relationship between MS and anxiety disorders [5] and the nature of this association. For this reason, experimental strategies to model MS/DM2 based on changes in the amount of either fat or sugar (sucrose) in the diet of rodents (for a review see [8], [9]) have been successfully attempted. However, information on their usefulness as paradigms to study the relationship between these metabolic entities and anxiety is rather scarce and contradictory. Furthermore, such studies have been so far practically restricted to animals kept under a high-fat diet (HFD) and their results are depending upon the length of feeding and the presence of stress [10–13]. Accordingly, whereas mice kept under a medium-term HFD (either 6, 12 or 14 weeks) developed an anxiogenic-like profile in different anxiety paradigms [14–17], rats eating a similar diet for a week show instead an anxiolytic-like behavior in the elevated-plus-maze (EPM) [18, 19]. In addition, no effects in anxiety were however found when mice were evaluated after a moderate-term (13 weeks) HFD in a triple anxiety test (open-field test (OFT) + EPM + light-dark box test (LDBT) [20]. Studies on the effects of a high carbohydrate diet (HCD) on anxiety, on the other hand, have been less conclusive and differ from those obtained using the HFD model. Thus, in the same studies rodents under HCD usually composed of sucrose (producing glucose and fructose upon digestion) as a source of carbohydrate displayed anxiolytic effects in the OFT [20] but have no effects in the EPM [18]. In contrast, Santos and colleagues reported that mice under a HCD (composed of 10% of sucrose) for 12 weeks exhibited an anxiogenic profile in the contextual fear conditioning test and in the EPM (only when animals suffered 2 h of restraint stress) [21]. Also, rats who were fed with a high-fructose diet for 8 week showed anxiogenic effects in the OFT and the LDBT [22]. Interestingly, rats subjected to a powdered diet containing a moderate amount of sucrose (7.9%) failed to induce any change in anxiety-like behavior at 52 weeks, as compared with rats that were kept under a sugar-free diet [23]. Although in both models (HFD or HCD) there is an increase in the animal’s caloric intake, they may differ in the way MS is induced [9, 24] and perhaps in the mechanism linked to their behavioral consequences since fructose, which is produced by sucrose digestion has been reported to have a number of effects, independently of its caloric contribution [24, 25]. Recently, Larqué et al. [8] reported that the exposure of young adult Wistar rats to high-sucrose (20%) in drinking water for 8 weeks induces a MS-like condition, i.e., abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure and dyslipidemia. Moreover, when the animals are kept under the above experimental conditions for longer periods (24 weeks), a slight hyperglycemia is added to these signs [26]. It has been demonstrated that a chronic, low-grade inflammatory condition is developed during MS, which is characterized by an increased secretion of adipocyte-related cytokines (adipokines) such as leptin, adiponectin and resistin, and some other cytokines secreted by other tissues, including the brain [27–29]. Their plasma levels are inversely (adiponectin) or directly (resistin) correlated to obesity, and they have opposite effects on insulin sensitivity [27, 30]. Furthermore, obesity has been associated with a high prevalence of emotional reactivity and cognitive dysfunction [29, 31]. Some works have linked obesity and an increase in anxiety-like behavior in the EPM [32]. However, the possible role of leptin and resistin as a pathophysiologic mechanism in the generation of anxiety-like behavior is not completely understood. Since MS is induced in rodents under a high-sucrose diet but changes on anxiety-like behavior are contradictory, the aim of this study was to ascertain whether a long-term high-sucrose diet (24 weeks) may be a useful rodent model to study the association between a MS-like condition and anxiety as well as its underlying factors. Metabolic and physiologic markers to ascertain whether or not MS was induced by the high-sucrose diet used were also measured.
