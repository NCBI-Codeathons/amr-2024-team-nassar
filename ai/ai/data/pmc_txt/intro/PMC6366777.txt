Introduction Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection [1]. Epidemiological studies suggest that more than 30 million cases of sepsis occur annually world-wide [2]. In the U.S., sepsis is the most expensive disease treated in hospitals with estimated hospital costs of > 20 billion US $ annually [3]. Mortality rates have been declining in high-income countries due to improved treatment and range from 20–50% depending on disease severity and other factors [4,5]. Immunologically, sepsis is characterised by concurrent proinflammatory and immunosuppressive alterations [6–10]. A prominent feature contributing to immunosuppression in sepsis is an early massive loss of lymphocytes due to apoptosis [8–12], which is recapitulated in mouse models of sepsis [8–10,13]. Profound or persistent lymphopenia in sepsis patients is associated with increased mortality [14,15]. Another important mechanism of sepsis-induced immune-suppression is the expansion of immunosuppressive cell populations including regulatory T lymphocytes, IL-10-producing B lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) [8–10,16]. We have recently shown that numbers of IL-10 producing B lymphocytes and MDSC remain increased for months after sepsis [16]. Sepsis-induced immune-suppression renders patients susceptible to secondary opportunistic infections [17,18] and reactivation of latent viral infections [19], both of which contribute to late sepsis mortality [4,5,20]. It is currently unclear how long the sepsis-induced immunosuppression lasts and if an immunological restitutio ad integrum is reached in sepsis survivors. Most clinical and experimental studies to date have focussed on the immunopathology of acute sepsis. Clinical and epidemiological data indicate a massively increased morbidity and mortality of sepsis survivors for years after discharge from the hospital [4,21–23] and it is currently unknown how much persistent immunological alterations contribute to this disease burden. Boosting the immune response in sepsis patients is a promising approach to improve survival [4,9,10]. One candidate approach is the cytokine Interleukin (IL)-7, which is important for T-cell survival [24]. Early IL-7 treatment has been shown to improve survival in murine sepsis models [25,26] and to restore normal lymphocyte counts and functions in septic patients [27,28]. On the other hand, late IL-7 treatment prolongs the sepsis induced expansion of immunosuppressive IL-10 producing B-lymphocytes and MDSC after sepsis [16]. We therefore studied the long-term recovery of different T cell subsets after sepsis with or without IL-7 treatment in the model of peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI) [16,29]. We analyzed the recovery of naive and effector/memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets and analyzed thymic output and T-cell receptor (TCR)-repertoire diversity 1 week, 1 month and 3.5 months after sepsis induction, representing the post-acute, late and very late time points, respectively. At 30 days after sepsis we also immunised mice with a fungal antigen and analyzed the T-cell response quantitatively and qualitatively.
