Introduction Fungi that infect plants are of great economic relevance because they cause severe crop losses (~10%) worldwide (Oerke, 2006). Therefore, the mechanisms underlying plant–fungus interactions have attracted great interest and have been extensively studied (Lo Presti et al., 2015). Secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activities are among the means naturally developed by plants for the control of fungal infections (Collemare et al., 2019). For example, tomatine, a glycoalkaloid secreted from the leaves and stems of tomato, has both fungicidal properties and insecticidal activities (Vance et al., 1987). Camalexin, an indole alkaloid produced by Brassicaceae plants, including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, also has antifungal properties (Nafisi et al., 2007). However, some fungi can overcome these toxic compounds to infect plants. The best-known strategy is the detoxification of antifungal compounds by the secretion of specific enzymes (Crombie et al., 1986; Osbourn et al., 1995; Pareja-Jaime et al., 2008). Thus, plants and infectious fungi are engaged in an arms race during the course of evolution. However, other than detoxification, the mechanistic diversity of the plant–fungus competition centered on plant secondary metabolites is largely unknown. Rocaglates, small molecules synthesized in plants of the genus Aglaia, exemplify antifungal secondary metabolites (Engelmeier et al., 2000; Iyer et al., 2020). In addition to its antifungal properties, this group of compounds is of particular interest because of its antitumor activities (Alachkar et al., 2013; Bordeleau et al., 2008; Cencic et al., 2009; Chan et al., 2019; Ernst et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2009; Manier et al., 2017; Nishida et al., 2021; Santagata et al., 2013; Skofler et al., 2021; Thompson et al., 2021; Thompson et al., 2017; Wilmore et al., 2021; Wolfe et al., 2014). Moreover, recent studies have suggested potency against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (Müller et al., 2021; Müller et al., 2020) and hepatitis E virus (Praditya et al., 2022). Rocaglates target translation initiation factor (eIF) 4A, a DEAD-box RNA binding protein, and function as potent translation inhibitors with a unique mechanism: rocaglate treatment does not phenocopy the loss of function of eIF4A but instead leads to gain of function. Although eIF4A activates the translation of cellular mRNA through ATP-dependent RNA binding, rocaglates impose polypurine (A and G repeated) sequence selectivity on eIF4A, bypassing the ATP requirements and evoking mRNA-selective translational repression (Chen et al., 2021; Chu et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2016; Rubio et al., 2014; Wolfe et al., 2014). The artificial anchoring of eIF4A (1) becomes a steric hindrance to scanning 40S ribosomes (Iwasaki et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2016), (2) masks cap structure of mRNA by tethering eIF4F (Chu et al., 2020), and (3) reduces the available pool of eIF4A for active translation initiation events by the sequestration of eIF4A on mRNAs (Chu et al., 2020). Since eIF4A is an essential gene for all eukaryotes, Aglaia plants must have a mechanism to evade the cytotoxicity of the rocaglates they produce. This self-resistance is achieved by the unique amino acid substitutions at the sites in eIF4A proteins where rocaglates directly associate (Iwasaki et al., 2019). Given the high evolutionary conservation of eIF4A and thus its rocaglate binding pocket (Iwasaki et al., 2019), these compounds may target a wide array of natural fungi. Irrespective of the antifungal nature of rocaglates, we found a parasitic fungus able to grow on Aglaia plants. De novo transcriptome analysis from the fungus revealed that this species belongs to the Ophiocordyceps genus, whose members infect ants and cause a 'zombie' phenotype (Andersen et al., 2009; Araújo and Hughes, 2019; de Bekker et al., 2017), but constitutes a distinct branch in the taxon. Strikingly, eIF4A from this fungus possessed an amino acid substitution in the rocaglate binding site and thus showed resistance to the compound. Using Colletotrichum orbiculare, a cucumber-infecting fungus, as a model, we demonstrated that the genetically engineered fungus with the substitution showed insensitivity to the translational repression induced by rocaglates, facilitating its infection of plants even in the presence of this compound. Our results indicate fungal resistance to plant secondary metabolites independent of detoxification enzymes and a unique contest between plants and fungi centered on secondary metabolites synthesized in the host plant.
