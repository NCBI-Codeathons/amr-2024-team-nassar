1. Introduction Antibiotics have been applied extensively in the clinic, veterinary medicine and farming as antibacterials. Of these antibiotics, macrolides are an important group of antibiotics, which account for 20% of all antibiotics prescribed. At least 500 kinds of macrolide antibiotics are known, most of which are derived from Streptomyces species. The frequently used macrolide antibiotics are erythromycin [1], oleandomycin [2,3], josamycin [4,5], midecamycin [4,6], spiramycin [7,8], roxithromycin [9,10], azithromycin [11,12], and clarithromycin [13,14]. Macrolides exhibit high activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and are thus used widely as excellent bacteriostatic agents due to their low toxicity and broad-spectrum activities. Macrolide antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the nascent peptide exit tunnel of the bacterial ribosome, thus leading to growth arrest or cell death. The action mechanism of macrolides is determined by the location of sugars and specific functional groups on their macrolactone rings [15,16,17]. However, as with other antibiotics, the misuse and overuse of macrolides will inevitably result in antibiotic resistance [18], which usually causes the decline or loss of antibiotic efficacy. Antibiotic-resistant infections can be difficult and sometimes impossible to treat, thereby resulting in extended hospital stays, higher medical costs and increased mortality. Antibiotic resistance is regarded as one of the biggest threats to healthcare, veterinary and agriculture industries in our time. Hence, it is urgent to explore the underlying mechanisms of macrolide resistance. To date, several mechanisms including antibiotics efflux, modifications of the antibiotic targets and antibiotic inactivation have been reported [19,20,21]. Of these mechanisms, antibiotic inactivation is achieved by enzyme-mediated structural modifications, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation and acylation [19,20]. Under the actions of modifying enzymes like phosphotransferases (PTs), glycosyltransferases (GTs) and acyltransferases (ATs), macrolide antibiotics are modified to form derivatives with structural alterations, which can impair target binding [18,19,20]. Enzymatic modification of antibiotics has been known as one of the most common resistance mechanisms, which is extensively present in antibiotic producers [18,22]. Enzymatic modifications are effective strategies to inactivate antibiotics, thereby avoiding their damage to producers, which is also called self-resistance [23]. GT-mediated macrolides inactivation has been observed in diverse producers, like Streptomyces vendargensis [24], S.
lividans [25,26,27], S.
antibioticus [28,29,30,31,32], Saccharopolyspora erythraea [33], Nocardia Species [34,35], S.
hygroscopicus [36] and S.ambofaciens [37]. Many macrolides, such as erythromycin [24,25,27], tylosin [25,27], rosaramicin [25,26,27,28], chalcomycin [26,27], lankamycin [26,27,28], methymycin [26,27,28], pikromycin [26,27], oleandomycin [26,27,28,29], spiramycin [26,27], azithromycin [26,27] and rapamycin [38] could be inactivated by glycosylation modifications. The glycosylation inactivation was deemed as a common self-protection mechanism in these macrolide-producing strains. Diverse macrolide-inactivating GTs had been isolated and functionally identified. The exemplifying macrolide-inactivating GTs were OleI and OleD from S. antibioticus [31], MGT from S. lividans [25], BaGT from Bacillus atrophaeus, BamGT from B.
amyloliquefaciens, BcGT-1 from B.cereus, BgGT from B.
glycinifermentans, BpGT from B.
paralicheniformis, as well as BsGT-1 and BssGT from B.
subtilis [38,39]. These GTs have been demonstrated to be acceptor promiscuous, recognizing multiple macrolides. Both OleI and OleD displayed activity against, for example, oleandomycin, carbomycin, tylosin and erythromycin [31]. MGT could recognize diverse macrolides such as chalcomycin, lankamycin, rosaramicin, methymycin, pikromycin and erythromycin [25,26,27]. Besides acceptor promiscuity, many antibiotic-inactivating GTs like OleI, OleD and MGT showed a wide donor tolerance [40], attaching diverse sugar moieties to an aglycon through a process named glycodiversification. The underlying mechanisms causing macrolide inactivation was elucidated through the structural identification of glycosylated macrolides. MGT usually inactivates methymycin, erythromycin, azithromycin or tylosin through the glucosylation on 2′-OH in their mycaminosyl moiety [25,26,27]. Likewise, both OleD and OleI inactivate oleandomycin by 2′-glucosylation in the mycaminosyl moiety [28,30,31,32,40,41,42,43]. Nocardia species inactivated chalcomycin and tylosin by the glucosylation at 2′-OH in the mycaminosyl moiety of the two antibiotics [35]. In addition, rapamycin inactivation was proved to be caused by glucosylation at its C-28 or C-40 position [38]. These evidences indicated that glucosylation modification at inactivation sites (C-2′, C-28, C-40) was the main glycosylation inactivation pattern of these macrolides. However, the effect of other glycosylation modifications, such as xylosylation and O-GlcNAcylation, on macrolide inactivation is still unknown. Midecamycin, a naturally occurring 16-membered macrolide, is synthesized from Streptomyces mycarofaciens [44,45]. It contains a 16-membered lactone ring, to which a disaccharide moiety 4′-O-(α-L-mycarosyl)-β-D-mycaminosyl is attached [46]. Midecamycin is active against both erythromycin-susceptible and efflux-mediated erythromycin-resistant strains [47]. Moreover, midecamycin and its derivatives are also active against mycoplasma species [4,6]. Hence, it has been widely applied in the clinic to treat upper and lower respiratory tract infections [48]. In addition, midecamycin and other macrolides were supplemented in feeds for food-producing animals to treat infectious diseases and promote the health [49,50]. Due to the important roles in clinical therapy and animal-derived food safety, midecamycin resistance has attracted significant attention [34,35]. Midecamycin resistance was due to drug inactivation caused by phosphorylation, reduction, deacylation, or a combination thereof [34,35]. It was not clear, however, that the glycosylation modifications including glucosylation of midecamycin could inactivate midecamycin. Herein, midecamycin inactivation caused by varied glycosylation modifications was demonstrated. Specifically, OleD was screened from four candidate GTs as the most favorable biocatalyst to glycodiversify midecamycin, generating five 2′-substituted glycosides, most of which had low yields (Figure 1). Protein engineering was then conducted with the aim to improve the conversions of OleD towards five reactive donors. Q327F and Q327A were thus identified as the most favorable biocatalysts capable of increasing the conversion towards UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Xyl, respectively. OleD, Q327F and Q327A were thus used as the biocatalysts for scale preparation of midecamycin 2′-O-glucopyranoside, midecamycin 2′-O-acetylglucosamine and midecamycin 2′-O-xylopyranoside, respectively. The antimicrobial activities of the three midecamycin 2′-O-glycosides were lost completely. These data indicated that glycosylation inactivation could contribute to midecamycin resistance. Besides glucosylation, other glycosylation patterns could result in midecamycin inactivation, suggesting glycosylation inactivation of midecamycin was independent of the type of attached sugar moieties. This study will lay a foundation for the mechanism clarification of macrolide resistance and the development of GT inhibitors as drugs.
