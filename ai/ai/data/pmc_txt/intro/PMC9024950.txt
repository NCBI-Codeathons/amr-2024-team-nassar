1. Introduction Over the last decades, harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased in intensity and frequency and have turned into a serious ecological issue in coastal waters worldwide [1,2,3,4]. Toxic bloom-forming dinoflagellates can not only negatively influence their predators, including heterotrophic dinoflagellates [5], copepods [6], ciliates [7] and other zooplankton [8], but also have significantly negative impacts on co-occurring phytoplankton by releasing secondary metabolites as allelopathic chemicals [9]. Alexandrium pacificum, a typical toxic-HAB-causing dinoflagellate capable of discoloring seawater with sufficient cell densities, is commonly observed in estuarine and coastal waters around the world [10,11]. Frequent blooms of this species have been reported in the South China Sea, Ofunato Bay, Japan, Jinhae-Masan Bay, Korea, and Bizerte Lagoon, resulting in significant ecological damage and economic loss [12,13,14,15]. Furthermore, A. pacificum is a major producer of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) [16]. Although PSP does not directly lead to the death of marine animals, it enters the human body through the food chain after being ingested by marine animals, and then poses a threat to human health and life safety [17,18]. In aquatic ecosystems, microalgae–bacteria interactions are complex. Many bloom-forming algal species have been known to form some associations with certain bacteria, but the reasons for these associations remain obscure [19]. The bacteria that closely associate with phytoplankton are believed to be involved in a wide range of interactions, including nutrient provision or competition [20,21,22], cell differentiation [23], and algicidal or bacterioprotective effects [24]. Previous studies have shown that algicidal bacteria have effective, species-specific, and environment-friendly features, which make them more outstanding than other chemical and physical methods in HABs control [25,26,27]. The ecological significance of algicidal bacteria was gradually recognized along with revelation of their specificity and diversity, stimulating attention towards the biological characteristics and ecological significance of these marine microorganisms. Most known algicidal bacteria belong to the Cytophaga–Flavobacteria–Bacteroidetes (CFB) group or Proteobacteria, such as Alteromonas, bacillus, Flavobacterium, Micrococcus, Pseudoalteromonas, Pseudomona, and Vibrio [25,26,28]. Mechanisms of algicidal bacteria-lysing algal cells mainly take a few pathways: destruction of cell structure, alteration of enzymatic activities, and influence on algal photosynthesis or respiration [29,30]. Physiological and biochemical responses of algal cells were detected, including the decrease of chlorophyll a, interruption of the electron transport in photosystem II, decrease of the effective quantum yields, accumulation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibition of antioxidant enzymes activities, and increase of malodialdehyde (MDA) content [25,26,28]. Algicidal effects are regulated in the species of algicidal bacteria and target cells, and in a dose-dependent manner [26,28]. For Alexandrium, the general dosage is 1–5% (v/v), and the algicidal rate can reach more than 80% within 48 h [29,31]. Up to now, many algicidal bacteria have been identified to control Alexandrium, and the morphological structure, physiological and biochemical responses, and functional gene expression of algal cells after exposure to algicidal bacteria were analyzed to clarify their algicidal mechanism [29,31], but few studies have focused on algicidal bacteria against A. pacificum. Herein, a highly effective algicidal bacterium, Shewanella Y1 (against A. pacificum), was isolated from Jiaozhou Bay and further confirmed with molecular characterization (16S rDNA sequencing). The objective of this study was to investigate its algicidal activity against the toxic dinoflagellate A. pacificum. By analyzing a series of changes of A. pacificum, we were able to identify the physiological characteristics of A. pacificum during the algicidal process. These findings will foster our understanding of complex algae-bacteria interactions and contribute to better understanding of the ecological roles of algicidal bacteria in the marine ecosystem.
