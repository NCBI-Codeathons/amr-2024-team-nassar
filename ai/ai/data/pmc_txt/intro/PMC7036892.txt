1. Introduction Nature’s ever-growing repository of chemical structures and reactions continues to shape the fields of chemistry and biology. Of particular note is the impact of natural products in modern medicine. It is estimated that anywhere from 50 to 70% of all clinically approved drugs are natural products, natural product derivatives, or inspired by natural products [1]. Specifically, 51% of anticancer new chemical entities (NCEs) and 59% of antibiotic NCEs from 1981 to 2014 were natural products or directly derived from there [1]. As nature’s small molecules are optimized through years of evolution, their affinity to their molecular targets is often exquisitely high. Thus, the discovery of natural products, especially with known targets, affords privileged chemical scaffolds for drug discovery and development [2]. Along with inspiration for drug design, natural product research presents critical questions about evolutionary ecology from individual species to entire biospheres [3,4]. At the micro-ecology scale, inter- and intra-species interactions are often mediated through small molecules that can grant evolutionary advantages to the producer [5]. Understanding these interactions can provide insight into complex biological systems and potentially provide a means to precisely manipulate these microecosystems [6]. This is epitomized by human gut microbiome studies, where understanding gut dysbiosis has led to prophylactic and responsive therapies [7]. On a larger scale, natural products can affect entire ecosystems. For example, harmful algal blooms releasing toxic small molecules can decimate entire aquatic ecosystems and, consequentially, influence socioeconomic systems [8]. Due to the inarguable utility of natural products, researchers have questioned the scope of structurally distinct molecules that can be produced by nature. While over the past 60 years there has been an attenuation in the natural product discovery rate and overall structural complexity, structurally-intriguing metabolites with diverse biological activities are continually disclosed each year [9]. Reports of unique structures are often identified from a broad phylogenetic range of organisms, ultimately suggesting that a vast proportion of nature’s chemical space remains undiscovered [9]. While typical natural product producing organisms still generate novel chemical structures, rediscovery has presented an obstacle [10]. One way to circumvent this is to innovate discovery methods and explore phylogenetically diverse organisms from various environments [9]. Over the past 20 years, genomic, transcriptomic, and bioinformatic advances have ignited natural product discovery approaches. Genetics-guided techniques, including genome mining, afford considerable advantages [11], especially in efforts to explore uncharted chemical space [12], or discovering metabolites with predicted molecular targets [13]. With a plethora of genome sequencing data publicly available [14], researchers can use bioinformatic platforms, such as antiSMASH [15], PRISM [16], and many others [17,18,19], to identify BGCs and test various hypotheses. Not only has this approach led to the identification of novel structures but it has also helped answer basic science questions surrounding gene cluster activation [20], self-resistance [21], and horizontal gene transfer [22], among others. Additionally, advances in automated DNA synthesis has greatly facilitated genome mining expeditions [23] and they provide an efficient auxiliary to molecular biology-based assembly of BGCs [24]. As the price per base for DNA synthesis continues to decrease [25,26], purchasing large BGCs of interest becomes less financially burdensome, enabling expression of BGCs in heterologous hosts. Meticulous investigation of how nature synthesizes molecules has not only inspired retrosynthetic design [27] but has also uncovered synthetically useful enzymes to facilitate previously elusive reactions [28]. Within bacteria, the workflow from the initial discovery of a natural product or BGC to chemoenzymatic functionality is versatile and can be approached from different paths. Biosynthetic investigation of the bacterially produced antibiotic, platensimycin, is one of many examples that displays how nature’s ability to manufacture molecules can directly enhance our synthetic tool kit (Figure 1). Through molecule discovery [29], gene cluster identification [30], and subsequent biosynthesis elucidation [31], an enzyme from this pathway has been successfully utilized in multiple chemoenzymatic total syntheses of difficult-to-access natural products [32]. In an ideal situation, researchers will have a specific application in mind and will be able to use bioinformatics to identify enzymes with the desired utility. Tremendous chemical and enzymatic diversity exist outside of bacteria and fungi, however, a multitude of technical difficulties impede discovering and harnessing these resources. A first step towards this goal is unlocking the biosynthetic potential of phylogenetically diverse organisms and continuing efforts to improve bioinformatics, genetics, enzymology, heterologous expression systems, and more in eukaryotes. Advancing available genome mining techniques in non-fungal eukaryotes faces a myriad of technical obstacles, especially due to the vast phylogenetic disparities between organisms. Despite this, diligent and creative approaches are enabling the field to unlock the biosynthetic potential of eukaryotes. Herein, we explore the recent advances in linking genes to previously known molecules, as well as genetics-guided approaches to find new molecules in phylogenetically diverse organisms.
