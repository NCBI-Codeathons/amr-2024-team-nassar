1. Introduction Actinobacteria produce the majority of naturally occurring antibiotics, and approximately two-thirds of naturally derived antibiotics in current clinical use were produced by actinobacteria [1,2]. As magic bullets, antibiotics have always been the most effective antimicrobials [3,4]; however, the bottleneck of rediscovery of known strains and antibiotics from the actinobacteria dwelling in traditional environmental niches decreases the efficiency of new antibiotic discovery and pushes researchers to shift the bioprospecting of pharmaceutical actinobacteria to underexplored genera and ecological niches or untapped sources [5,6], such as rare actinobacteria or extreme geographical locations including deserts [7], mangroves [8], caves [9], deep-sea [10], etc. [11]. However, the antibiotic discovery of actinobacteria isolated from saline lakes has thus far been minimal, which needs more research to focus on the source [12,13]. Saline lakes are widely distributed in the world and are categorized into three zones based on their location, including the southern hemisphere lake zone, the northern hemisphere lake zone, and the equatorial lake zone [14]. In addition to being hypersaline, saline lake ecosystems are often characterized by other harsh environmental conditions, such as high alkalinity, low oxygen concentration, low nutrient availability, and high solar irradiation, depending on the geographical area [15,16]. Although considered to be a hostile environment for the growth of most organisms, saline lakes are often teeming with a large diversity of microbial communities, including bacteria, archaea, viruses, and eukaryotes [17,18]. Over the past two decades, extensive studies based on culture-dependent and independent techniques have been conducted to survey the microbial diversity of the saline lake environments, as exemplified by the Great Salt Lake in the United States [19], the Dead Sea [20], Chott El Jerid Lake in Tunisia [21], Meyghan Lake in Iran [22], the Solar Lake in Egypt [23], Chaka Lake, Keke Lake, and Aiding Lake in China [24,25,26]. Moreover, groups of novel halophilic or halotolerant bacteria found in saline lakes have been described. To the best of our knowledge, up to the end of January 2022, a total of 64 novel species of actinobacteria, including two new orders (Nitriliruptorales [27] and Jiangellales [28,29]), three new families (Nitriliruptoraceae [27], Jiangellaceae [28,29] and Ruaniaceae [30]) and 13 new genera, have been reported from the inland saline environment. Microorganisms inhabiting inland saline environments have been reported to produce versatile substances of interest, such as hydrolytic enzymes, compatible solutes, pigments, and antibiotics [31]. Some anti-tumor and antimicrobial substances have been discovered from actinobacteria inhabiting saline environments, such as salternamides A-E [32,33], salinazinones A-B [34] and xiamycins C-E [35] from Streptomyces; erythronolides H-I [36] and actinopolysporins A-C [37] from Actinopolyspora; and borrelidins C-E [38] and nocarbenzoxazoles A-G [39] from Nocardiopsis. Chemical types of these entities are composed of anthraquinones, benzofurans, sesquiterpenoids, oxazinones, macrolides, etc. However, reports on the bioactive metabolites produced by actinobacteria from the inland saline environment are still scant, which is incomparable with those reported from other extreme environments such as deserts, mangroves, and deep seas [40]. Therefore, the pharmaceutical potential of actinobacteria residing in pristine saline lakes needs to be further deeply explored. China is one of the countries with the most extensive distribution of saline lakes. These lakes spread over four regions: the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau region, the Northwestern region, the North-central region, and the Eastern region [41]. Tibet is situated on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, which is known as the “Roof of the World” and “The Third Pole” due to its average height above sea level of over 4000 m, and it is the second-largest store of ice on Earth after the Arctic or Antarctic [42]. The Northern Tibetan Plateau, also known as “Qiangtang Plateau," is the main part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, covering about 0.6 million square kilometers with an altitude exceeding 4500 m above sea level [43]. There are approximately 221 saline lakes in Tibet, with the vast majority (214) distributed in the Northern Tibetan Plateau (Qiangtang Plateau) [44]. However, the challenging climate, low oxygen levels, high radiation, and shortage of supplies in this region make it extremely formidable for researchers to explore its scientifically valuable resources, such as saline lakes. Therefore, exploration of the actinobacterial diversity of the saline lakes on the Northern Tibetan Plateau is quite rare, and their associated bioactive secondary metabolites are hitherto uncharacterized. The present study focuses on the exploration of actinobacterial strains as potential pharmaceutical resources for the production of biomolecules with antimicrobial or anti-tumor properties in extreme or unusual environments instead of traditional and easily accessible environments. Specifically, we isolated cultivable actinobacteria from the sediments of four saline lakes located on the Northern Tibetan Plateau, namely Dangqiong Co., Dong Co., Nieer Co., and a nameless saline lake. To assess the antibacterial activity of these isolates against the “ESKAPE” [45] pathogens, the OSMAC approach in conjunction with a 24-well microbioreactor system, known in-lab as MATRIX cultivation [46,47] was employed. Multi-omics approaches, including UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS-based metabolomics profiling, molecular networking, and genome mining, were utilized to identify potential secondary metabolites produced by two Streptomyces strains with DNA-damage activity. The findings of this study could provide valuable information for bioprospecting new sources of antibiotics for further research in the saline lakes of China.
