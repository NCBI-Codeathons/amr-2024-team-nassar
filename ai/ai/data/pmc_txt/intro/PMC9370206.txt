1. Introduction Soybean is a well-known leguminous crop with a high percentage of protein and oil in seed [1]. Despite having its origin in China [2], it is extensively cultivated in most parts of the world [3]. Due to its adaptability to different climatic zones, soybean gained popularity and became one of the top crops, i.e., wheat, paddy and maize (http://faostat.fao.org/, accessed on 1 July 2022). Soybean is employed in the production of various food as well as industrial products. Apart from these applications, it is also used as animal feed [4]. An array of biotic [5,6] and abiotic [7,8,9,10,11] factors are responsible for yield reduction in soybean. Most of the abiotic factors depend upon climatic conditions [12]. Nevertheless, biotic factors involve pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, nematodes, etc. [13]. Among the diseases reported in soybean, 29 are fungal, 6 bacterial, 18 viral, 6 nematodal and 3 mycoplasmal [14]. Amongst all fungal diseases, about 10 have a consistent presence in diverse parts of the world. Of these, six pathogens, viz., Sclerotium rolfsii, Macrophomina phaseolina, Colletotrichum truncatum, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, Cercospora sojina and Cercospora kikuchii, are severe in India. Even though a lot of control measures have been developed and adopted, a combined approach for management of these pathogens is stilllacking [15]. Diseases caused by these pathogens are generally controlled by means of chemicals [16]. Controlling diseases with the application of chemicals is costly at the farmer level. It also causes environmental and water pollution because of the dangers associated with these chemicals [17]. Development of resistant varieties reduces the use of chemicals [18], andalso helps in the reduction in environmental pollution and providing safe food to humans [19]. Identification or development of resistant soybean genotypes against different diseases is a major challenge [20]. Molecular breeding technologyhas proven its efficiency in the transfer of genes toa desired cultivar. These tools are less time consuming in comparison to traditional plant breeding [21] as desired plants can be selected at the initial stage of their growth. Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) provides basic information about the association of a specific molecular marker with desired trait [22]. It also defines the distance between a flanking marker and gene of interest. Resistance in soybean has been reported to be mono or polygenic. The present review provides an insight into molecular breeding approaches adopted in the identification of biotic stressresistance genes and markers associated with the targeted genes in soybean.
