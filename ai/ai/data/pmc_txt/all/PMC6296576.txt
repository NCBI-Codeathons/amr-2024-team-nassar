The need for a new antibiotic pipeline to confront threat imposed by resistant pathogens has become a major global concern for human health. To confront the challenge there is a need for discovery and development of new class of antibiotics. Nature which is considered treasure trove, there is re-emerged interest in exploring untapped microbial to yield novel molecules, due to their wide array of negative effects associated with synthetic drugs. Natural product researchers have developed many new techniques over the past few years for developing diverse compounds of biopotential. Taking edge in the advancement of genomics, genetic engineering, in silico drug design, surface modification, scaffolds, pharmacophores and target-based approach is necessary. These techniques have been economically sustainable and also proven efficient in natural product discovery. This review will focus on recent advances in diverse discipline approach from integrated Bioinformatics predictions, genetic engineering and medicinal chemistry for the synthesis of natural products vital for the discovery of novel antibiotics having potential application. Keywords Introduction Introduction Microbial natural products (MNPs) have been a prominent source for drug discovery since the discovery of the penicillin by Alexander Fleming. MNPs has been critical importance in therapeutically viable drugs against infectious diseases, antioxidants, cancer, diabetes, etc. [1] During the age of antibiotic discovery 1940–1970 has been accounted for major antibiotics known today as a result of vast screening efforts by natural product researchers. FDA assessment of natural products reveals that nearly one-quarter of these has been derived from microbial sources [1], [2]. The long-established approach of ‘herbal remedy’ has been substituted with precise compounds emerging from the gene and molecular altered microbial products. Hence, microbial natural products have replaced plant-derived compounds as a source of therapeutic agents and has been a potential source for the discovery of novel therapeutics in the past decades. In recent years, there has been declination of natural products but an increase in their synthetic derivatives. This has greatly impacted therapeutic pipeline from the exploration of novel natural products being abandoned in the last decade by pharmaceutical industries. The perception of all the major classes of antibiotics had been found to be the main reason for the abandonment. Synthetic drugs have been preferred as screening methods for natural products, resulted in redundant isolates than novel compounds, also due to large-scale amount and time required for discovery [3]. Nowadays, the funding opportunities have been provided through academia, charities and governmental institutions for the quest. Due to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the antibiotic pipeline for combating serious life-threatening infections is almost empty against drug-resistant pathogens [1], [2]. But, the diversity of chemical skeletons provided by MNPs has been a ray of hope. To tackle the unmet clinical challenge posed by multidrug resistance and also to cure ailments there is a need to readdress the issue with a new class of antibiotics through innovative approaches with completely different new framework using a directed synthesis of MNPs [2]. Earlier studies state natural products, as a result of evolutionary modification by mutation or through variation leading to change in the biosynthetic pathways for emergence bioactive molecules with the potency and selectivity to bind to biological targets [3], [4]. This has attracted natural product researchers to explore the enzymology and biosynthesis for modulation possibilities for new molecular entities. There have been several new techniques developed for the natural product discovery in the recent years, initiating a ‘new era in natural therapeutic discovery’.

Microbial natural products as therapeutics Microbial natural products as therapeutics Threat imposed by drug-resistant pathogens has been a global concern. The inefficacies of available antibiotic pipeline in combating existing multidrug-resistant pathogens has been a critical issue in recent years. This has been attributed due to overexploitation antibiotics resulting in resistance to these pathogens. MNPs could be a prominent strategy for meeting the present preclinical requisite exerted by drug-resistant pathogens. MNPs have unusual chemical skeletons and diversification which could target varied regions leading to the potential for drug discovery. The regained interest of natural products with the amalgamation of cutting-edge developments in drug discovery has gained utmost importance for a targeted approach. MNPs have offered an efficient source of new drug leads, however, it is attributed to evolutionary advantage by selective mutation for the organism. In this regard concoction of untapped sources with recent advances in drug discovery techniques would enable to provide a new class of antibiotics. MNP analogue libraries could provide a base for medicinal chemistry for pharmaceutical profiling for enhancing the desired phenotype as well as providing insights on target and pathways [5], [6].

Antibiotic resistance Antibiotic resistance Antibiotics had been effective against prevalence and prevention of infections in the yesteryears. But, recently there has been a complication of resistance adopted by most of the pathogens in the pipeline of available antibiotics. The resistance has been linked to overexploitation of antibiotics leading to molecular, gene, cellular and community level resistance. Antibiotics have high affinity to the targets if there is a single point of mutation could trigger the surface resulting in resistance and proliferation as well transfer of resistance gene by transformation. Enzyme catalysed inactivation of antibiotics by hydrolysis has been crucial reason for failure β lactam antibiotics preventing cell penetration, alteration of targets and resisting the action of antibiotics [7]. Formation of biofilms has been one of the major reasons for antibiotic failure. Microbes conglomerate to form biofilms leading to irreversible attachment to the biotic/abiotic surface. Biofilms aid consortia of microbes against oxidative stress, increase in specific efflux pumps and also protection by providing an outer layer of extracellular polysaccharide layer. In addition, the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer is found to be in increased levels [8], [9]. Hence, the concentration of antibiotic to inhibit these planktonic cells is much higher when compared to sessile cells.

Regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis Regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis Antibiotics are secondary metabolites without a functionalised role in cell growth or reproduction. Antibiotics inherit specialised functions, which trigger intra/intracellular signalling (such as Carbon Catabolite Regulation, Nitrogen Metabolite Regulation, Phosphate Regulation), either for communication, nutrition and defence. The major diversity of antibiotics is attributed to combination synthesis of polyketides (PKS), non-ribosomal peptides (NRPS) pathways [10], [11].

Conventional discovery and development of antibiotics Conventional discovery and development of antibiotics Drug discovery involves identification of compounds with potential for blocking a single gene, gene product or molecular mechanism determined by genetic analysis or biological observations associated with the disorder [12]. Drug discovery involves multistep process Fig. 1.

The target could be an enzyme or protein which needs to be either blocked or activated to induce response for the cure of abnormality. Assay development involves a quest for bioactive compounds e.g., bioautography, paper disk method inhibiting the target to restore homeostasis. Screening enables high-throughput data for analysing a multitude of compounds. Hits and leads stage, a variety of parameters are examined such as the specificity, toxicity, and molecular structure of the bioactive molecule. Lead optimization is employed to ameliorate specificity, reduce toxicity, and also to enable a wide antibiotic spectrum of lead compound [14]. Once the criteria are achieved according to standards, drug development and clinical trials are followed. The drug is tested for safety and efficacy, in animal models preliminarily, followed in three stages on humans in clinical settings.

Genome mining Genome mining Genome mining In the past decade, genome mining as an alternate strategy which has been considered against traditional screening for drug discovery. The genome mining approach aid in identifying and prediction analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters from genes to molecules. With a large library of information of DNA existing with the computational approach, there is the probability of wide array of novel molecules encoded in genome providing a new class of antibiotics. Genome mining has proved to be fast, the user-friendly and reliable technique also cost effective. Mining of genome has been potential for previously unfeasible antibiotics. The mining approach would enable target directed discovery by predicting the chemical structure and class using bioinformatics in amalgamation with bioassay-guided isolation, along with silent gene activation and heterologous expression techniques for novel bioactive metabolites [17], [18]. For instance, polyketides (PKs) and non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) represent abundances of molecules with biological diversity such as daptomycin, erythromycin, and many others. NRPs and PKs of microbial origin represents a significant proportion of natural bioactive products. The accumulated knowledge of the NRPSs or PKSs constituting biosynthetic pathways or another type of NPs gene clusters helps to predict and isolate new gene clusters, engineering or production of NPs in heterologous hosts. There has been a significant development in a number of algorithms developed based on probabilistic approach, evolutionary distances in the genome to understand the pathways for biosynthesis of natural products. Most of the algorithms presently employed are based on domains and Pfam regions in well-known secondary metabolite pathways such polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthatases (NRPS).

Cluster Assignment by Islands of Sites (CASSIS) was developed by Wolf et al. CASSIS scans the genome (FASTA format) for key enzymes prerequisite for secondary metabolite production such as polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and dimethylallyltryptophan synthases [19]. Another program antiSMASH 3.0 was developed by Weber et al. an updated version of the previous server-based program. The program uses the probabilistic approach and allows the user to input using multi-FASTA, GenBank and EMBL formats. The embedded modified Cluster Blast and ClusterFinder with better sensitivity and specificity to identify biosynthetic gene clusters has potential for discovering novel drugs [20]. A new PKS-NRPS hybrid product, haliamide was determined by in silico genome analysis using antiSMASH from myxobacterium Haliangium ochraceum. The biosynthetic gene cluster constituted one NRPS module with four PKS modules having 21.7 kbp. The putative gene cluster harboured in myxobacterium could lead to the isolation of additional compounds with biological potential [21]. Salinilactam, a polyene macrolactam was discovered along with 17 novel biosynthetic gene clusters coding for polyene derivatives from a marine actinomycete Salinispora tropica
[22]. Genome mining and genetic manipulations strategies were employed on marine actinomycete Streptomyces olivaceus yielded two new naphthoquinone macrolides olimycins A and B [23]. A 92 kb cryptic biosynthetic gene comprising hybrid polyketide and nonribosomal peptide marine Streptomyces pactum, was activated by genetic modification resulted in a novel sulfonate containing analogue totopotensamide C [24]. Sweeney et al. reported the genome mining of Streptomyces nodosus, the organism constituted several biosynthetic gene clusters for polyketides, peptides, siderophores and terpenes synthesis. These compounds were found to be expressed in low quantities or silent in comparison with amphotericin expression [25]. The notable anti-infectives through mining approach include clarepoxcins and landepoxcin [26], cypemycin, [27] haloduracin [28], Lactocillin [29], microcyclamide [30], teixobactin [31] reistomycin [32], microviridin [33] and microbisporicin [34] to mention in few.

Streptomyces coelicolor genome mining revealed locus SCO 7131 of estA gene suggested that it might differ in substrate specificity with respect to members of the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) family of lipases and esterases. The estA gene was expressed using His-tagged protein in Escherichia coli, enzyme purified was found to be an esterase, which hydrolyzed the acetate ester of p-nitrophenol, but possessed mild activity on esters with longer side chains and exhibited optimal activity against caproate (C6) esters. Modification using site-directed mutagenesis led to an increased activity against butyrate and caproate esters but affected by reducing the thermostability of the enzyme. Using the genome mining data, the changes in the amino acid in conserved regions to indicate active sites could be employed for characterization of novel enzymes [48]. Genome mining of Streptomyces coelicolor revealed beyond 50 presumptive genes for putative lipolytic enzymes. EstC, purified recombinant enzyme from the gene cluster exhibited cold-active esterase activity along with the production of valuable esters. The enzyme possessed alcohol and organic solvent tolerance, which could be employed for organic synthesis of short-chain esters such as flavours [49].

Combinatorial biosynthesis Combinatorial biosynthesis Combinatorial biosynthesis Combinatorial biosynthesis can be generally referred as “induced evolution” for designer antibiotics through genetics and/or medicinal chemistry. The engineering of novel chemical entities by combinatorial approach utilises the key enzymes involved in secondary metabolite of antibiotic synthesis pathways such as polyketide synthase (PKS), nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS), thioesterase (TE), acyl transferase (AT), 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS), dehydratase (DH), enoyl reductase (ER), ketoreductase (KR) and ketosynthase (KS). The combinatorial synthesis has been proven successful between antibiotic-producing organisms for producing hybrid gene products. The feasibility of technique has been efficient among organisms constituting PKS gene (PKS Type I and II) due to the fact PKS families consist of variable and multifunctional roles [57], [58], [59]. PKS and NRPS assemblies constitute large enzymes composed of polypeptides ranging from 100 kDa to MDa. The antibiotic synthesis involves gene to enzyme creating chemical triggers in assembly-line fashion to synthesize the final product. To achieve effective biosynthesis natural product researchers must balance the antibiotic synthesis pathway with host cell growth which could possibly by achieved genetic engineering in certain scenarios.

NMR-based metabolomics with proteomic approach facilitated identification of gene cluster which deciphered an enzyme indole prenyltransferase that catalyzed the conversion of tryptophan into 7-prenylisatin [69]. Wu et al. reported novel C-glycosylpyranonaphthoquinones in Streptomyces sp. MBT76 utilising combined approach of NMR based metabolomics and mining strategy. The qin gene cluster of type II PKS pathway was activated leading to 8-C-glycosylation, 5,14-epoxidation, and 13-hydroxylation also fusing deoxy aminosugar to the pyranonaphthoquinone.

Metabolomic analysis using high-resolution LC-MS and NMR for dereplication purposes was employed in the study of 64 actinomycetes was isolated from 12 different marine sponge species. The LC-MS/NMR based detection aided in prioritizing two isolates belonging to the genera Streptomyces (SBT348) and Micromonospora (SBT687) which exhibited distinct chemistry profiles. The isolates possessed potent anti-trypanosomal activities. The chemically unique strains were profiled rapidly with utilisation hyphenation techniques of metabolomics [71]. Chemical communication in co-culture of Cladosporium sp. WUH1 and Bacillus subtilis CMCC (B) 63,501 resulted in the production of previously reported diphenyl ethers with polyhydroxy sidechains including a novel antibiotic. The metabolomic approach integrating LC-MS analysis, along with statistical tools and molecular networking revealed diphenyl ethers might be a defensive response against growth inhibition resulting from surfactins by B. subtilis
[72]. A series of lipidic spirohemiaminals possessing broad antimicrobial activity were reported by surveying unique molecular signatures identified in the mass spectrometry data obtained by co-culture of Streptomyces nigrescens HEK616 and Tsukamurella pulmonis TPB0596 [73]. NMR-based metabolomics combined with multivariate data analysis was employed in the determination of secondary metabolites produced by co-culture of revealed A. niger and S. coelicolor. The biotransformation studies revealed synthesis of novel compounds (E)-2-(3-hydroxyprop-1-en-1-yl)-phenol and (2E, 4E)-3-(2-carboxy-1-hydroxyethyl)-2, 4-hexadienedioxic acid, respectively [74]. The comparison of the metabolome profile of the co-culture with that of the individual microorganisms would enlighten differentiation of induced metabolites present in co-culture but absent in monocultures, also these de novo-engineered molecules have high chances of being novel compounds or new derivatives with biological activity. Metabolomics approach for natural product discovery greatly depends on natural product libraries which enable rapid characterization of known compounds. Spectroscopic data libraries such as TCM Database@Taiwan, traditional Chinese medicine integrative database (TCMID), Chinese ethnic minority traditional drug database (CEMTDD), SuperToxic, NPACT, 3DMET DNP (Dictionary of Natural Products), Dictionary of Marine Natural Products, ACD/Labs NMR, ACD/Spectrus, UCSD Natural Products Database Napralert, NuBBE and SuperNatural have been developed over the recent years [75], [76].
