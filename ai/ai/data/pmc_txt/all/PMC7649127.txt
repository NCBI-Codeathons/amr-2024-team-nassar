The typical vibriosis, acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), has resulted in mass mortality and devastating economic losses. Thus, therapeutic strategies are highly needed to decrease the risk of vibriosis outbreaks. Herein, we initially identified that the growth of the causative agent of AHPND, Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND) and other vibrios in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was inhibited by a Bacillus subtilis strain BSXE-1601. The natural products amicoumacins A, B, and C were purified from the cell-free supernatant from the strain BSXE-1601, but only amicoumacin A was demonstrated to be responsible for this anti-Vibrio activity. Our discovery provided the first evidence that amicoumacin A was highly active against shrimp pathogens, including the representative strain VPAHPND. Furthermore, we elucidated the amicoumacin A biosynthetic gene cluster by whole genome sequencing of the B. subtilis strain BSXE-1601. In addition to amicoumacin A, the strain BSXE-1601 genome harbored other genes encoding bacillibactin, fengycin, surfactin, bacilysin, and subtilosin A, all of which have previously reported antagonistic activities against pathogenic strains. The whole-genome analysis provided unequivocal evidence in support of the huge potential of the strain BSXE-1601 to produce diverse biologically antagonistic natural products, which may facilitate further studies on the effective therapeutics for detrimental diseases in shrimp. Introduction Introduction The greatest challenge in the global shrimp industry is a disease particularly that of bacterial origin and chief among these is Vibrio species (Ajadi et al., 2016; Hoseinifar et al., 2018). The acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), formerly known as shrimp “early mortality syndrome” (EMS), is a newly emerging vibriosis that has caused severe mortality (up to 100%) and devastating economic effect in the global shrimp industry (Lightner et al., 2012; Joshi et al., 2014; Kongrueng et al., 2015; Boonsri et al., 2017). Infected shrimp show slow growth, an empty stomach and midgut, and severe atrophy of hepatopancreas (Joshi et al., 2014; Kongrueng et al., 2015; Sirikharin et al., 2015; Han et al., 2020). Originally, the etiological agent of AHPND has been reported to be Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND) (Tran et al., 2013). Recent studies have shown that other Vibrio spp., such as Vibrio punensis (Restrepo et al., 2018), Vibrio owensii (Liu et al., 2015), Vibrio harveyi-like (Kondo et al., 2015), and Vibrio campbellii (Dong et al., 2017a,b) are also capable of inducing AHPND in shrimp. Besides AHPND, other vibrioses were frequently reported in farmed shrimp caused by Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio anguillarum, V. harveyi, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio splendidus, V. campbellii and Vibrio fischeri (Lavilla-Pitogo et al., 1990; Lightner, 1996; Lavilla-Pitogo et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2000; Jayasree et al., 2006; Longyant et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2016; Chandrakala and Priya, 2017; Karnjana et al., 2019). Furthermore, non-Vibrio species such as Aeromonas spp. (Dierckens et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 2019), Streptococcosis spp. (Hasson et al., 2009), Shewanella spp. (Wang et al., 2000), Flavobacterium spp. (Chandrakala and Priya, 2017) and Pseudoalteromonas spp. (Zheng et al., 2016) were also documented to cause severe diseases in fish and shrimp aquaculture. Hence, strategies that focus on restraining the growth or activity of pathogenic bacteria are highly needed. The greatest challenge in the global shrimp industry is a disease particularly that of bacterial origin and chief among these is Vibrio species (Ajadi et al., 2016; Hoseinifar et al., 2018).

Hence, strategies that focus on restraining the growth or activity of pathogenic bacteria are highly needed. Recently, Bacillus spp. have been suggested to present a high interest as a promising therapeutic agent against vibriosis and other diseases in aquaculture, because of their antagonistic properties against aquatic pathogenic microorganisms, and their non-pathogenic and non-toxic characteristics (Rengpipat et al., 2003; Aly et al., 2008; Ran et al., 2012; Hoseinifar et al., 2018; Kuebutornye et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). The bacteriostatic properties of Bacillus spp. are linked primarily to the bioactive natural products produced by themselves (Kuebutornye et al., 2019). These natural products are not necessary for the survival of their producers but offer advantages under particular environmental conditions (Hug et al., 2020). They are highly optimized in the course of evolution for interactions with biological targets and, thus, exhibit various biological functions, such as antibacterial, antifungal and immunosuppressive activities (Hug et al., 2020). Genus Bacillus can produce a large variety of biologically active natural products, including non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) (e.g., bacillibactin, bacilysin, fengycin, surfactin), polyketides (PKs) (e.g., bacillaene, difficidin, and macrolactin), ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) (e.g., lanthipeptides, lasso peptides, sactipeptides), polyketide-peptide hybrids (e.g., amicoumacin and ieodoglucomide), terpenes and alkaloids (Reimer and Bode, 2014; Li et al., 2015; Bartholomae et al., 2017; Greule et al., 2017; Kaspar et al., 2019; Hug et al., 2020). Nonetheless, the Bacillus spp. with broad-spectrum bacteriostatic activity utilized to control shrimp diseases especially AHPND are poorly documented and it is less clear by what mode of action these bacteria mitigate infections and facilitate shrimp culture.

Nonetheless, the Bacillus spp. with broad-spectrum bacteriostatic activity utilized to control shrimp diseases especially AHPND are poorly documented and it is less clear by what mode of action these bacteria mitigate infections and facilitate shrimp culture. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the biologically active natural products produced by Bacillus spp. against AHPND and other vibriosis in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). To fulfill this goal, we chose a bacterial strain named BSXE-1601 as a therapeutic agent candidate. This strain was isolated from both the intestine of shrimp and the sediments of shrimp culture ponds during August 2013 at Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province, China. In the present study, an assessment of the antagonistic activity in vitro was conducted to identify the therapeutic potential of the strain BSXE-1601 against vibriosis. Moreover, a bioactive metabolite responsible for this anti-Vibrio activity was isolated, structure analyzed, and bioactivity determined. To interrogate the potential biosynthetic pathways of the bioactive metabolites and the biosynthetic capability of the strain BSXE-1601, the whole genome sequencing of the strain BSXE-1601 was conducted. Our whole-genome analysis of BSXE-1601 provides a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the anti-Vibrio properties and its high potential to be used as a multifunctional biological agent in aquaculture by suppressing pathogenic microbes of shrimp.

Structure Elucidation of the Compounds Structure Elucidation of the Compounds Structure Elucidation of the Compounds Careful analysis of the bioactive fractions obtained from B. subtilis BSXE-1601 using LC-MS revealed three isocoumarins like components from the chromatogram, which were further tested to be bioactive against several aquatic pathogens (Figure 3A). Large-scale fermentation, as well as chromatographic purification, allow further characterization of these three compounds as amicoumacins A-C (compounds 1-3) (Figure 3B), based on a careful comparison of their 1D NMR and ESI-MS with the published data (Itoh et al., 1982; Table 3). We observed the fast interconversion between 2 and 3 in methanol under room temperature, which was consistent with the previous description (Itoh et al., 1982), partly due to the spontaneous intramolecular condensation between the -COOH and its γ-OH in 2, as well as the hydrolysis of 5-membered lactone ring in 3. The product ratio of 1-3 was calculated to be 4.8: 1.5: 1 based on their peak area.

Discussion Discussion The growth of AHPND causative agent, VPAHPND 2S01, as well as V. alginolyticus AR-1, V. harveyi SRTT9, V. vulnificus S01P2, Pseudoalteromonas sp. LPE40 and S. marisflavi AP629 was inhibited by the bioactive strain BSXE-1601 isolated from both shrimp intestine and shrimp culture ponds in this study. These bacterial pathogens are not only the most important causative agents of bacterial infections in shrimp but also responsible for fatal diseases in fish, shellfish and sea cucumber (Wang et al., 1999, 2000; Li et al., 2010, 2011; Austin et al., 2012; Petton et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2016; Boonsri et al., 2017; Chandrakala and Priya, 2017; Karnjana et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2019). The isolated strain BSXE-1601 was then identified as B. subtilis by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Recently, Bacillus species have been frequently reported to have the antagonistic properties against aquatic pathogenic bacteria, such as V. parahaemolyticus (Vinoj et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013), V. harveyi (Liu et al., 2014; Zokaeifar et al., 2014), V. splendidus (Zhao et al., 2012), V. alginolyticus (Zhang et al., 2011), A. hydrophila and E. tarda (Ran et al., 2012). Hence, Bacillus species presented a high interest as a promising therapeutic agent against vibriosis and other diseases in aquaculture (Aly et al., 2008; Ran et al., 2012; Hoseinifar et al., 2018).

Hence, Bacillus species presented a high interest as a promising therapeutic agent against vibriosis and other diseases in aquaculture (Aly et al., 2008; Ran et al., 2012; Hoseinifar et al., 2018). The biologically active natural products are mainly responsible for the bacteriostatic properties of Bacillus spp. (Kaspar et al., 2019; Kuebutornye et al., 2019). In the past decade, a new complex of the isocoumarins group has been extracted from the cell-free supernatant of Bacillus spp. (Saeed, 2016). Amicoumacins were the most studied and well-characterized isocoumarins which are composed of the low molecular weight phenylpropanol derivative substances. Amicoumacin A was first discovered from B. pumilus by Itoh et al. (1981) and then from different Bacillus strains (Pinchuk et al., 2002; Zidour et al., 2017; Terekhov et al., 2018) and Xenorhabdus bovienii (Park et al., 2016). The strong anti-inflammatory and antiulcer properties of amicoumacin A were reported in the 1980s (Itoh et al., 1981; Iron et al., 1982), which was subsequently associated with its anticancer activity (Li et al., 2012; Prokhorova et al., 2016). Furthermore, amicoumacin A was documented to display a pronounced bactericidal activity against clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori (Pinchuk et al., 2001) and the “superbug” methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Berrue et al., 2009; Lama et al., 2012; Han et al., 2013; Terekhov et al., 2020). Noteworthily, besides the clinical applications, amicoumacin A produced by B. pumilus H2 also exhibited antagonistic effect toward the fish pathogen V. vulnificus CZ-A2 in vitro (Gao et al., 2017). The discovery gave a new insight into the mechanism of the anti-Vibrio activity of Bacillus spp. However, there was limited information about the mitigation infection of amicoumacin A on aquatic animal pathogens, and its activity against the representative strain VPAHPND and other shrimp pathogens was not previously described.

In our research, the biologically active metabolite which was responsible for the antagonistic activity of B. subtilis BSXE-1601 was identified as amicoumacin A, according to its physicochemical characterization and NMR spectral data analysis. Furthermore, the MICs determination for familiar aquatic animal pathogens suggested that amicoumacin A was very effective on VPAHPND 2S01, V. alginolyticus AR-1, V. harveyi SRTT9, V. vulnificus S01P2, Pseudoalteromonas sp. LPE40 and S. marisflavi AP629, which was matched by the antagonistic properties of the strain BSXE-1601 culture broth. Our discovery provided the first evidence that amicoumacin A was highly active against the especially important Gram-negative shrimp pathogenic bacteria. These pathogens are also responsible for fatal diseases in fish, shellfish and sea cucumber (Li et al., 2010; Austin et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2019). Hence, our work may facilitate the application of the B. subtilis strain BSXE-1601 as the effective therapeutic for detrimental diseases in aquaculture. In our research, the biologically active metabolite which was responsible for the antagonistic activity of B. subtilis BSXE-1601 was identified as amicoumacin A, according to its physicochemical characterization and NMR spectral data analysis.

Hence, our work may facilitate the application of the B. subtilis strain BSXE-1601 as the effective therapeutic for detrimental diseases in aquaculture. To elucidate the mechanism of the action of amicoumacin A, many functional studies were conducted. Lama et al. (2012) found that when amicoumacin A was exposed to MRSA, it reduced the activity of murein hydrolase, called autolysin, which was highly needed in the regulation of continued wall extension and cellular division (Higgins et al., 1970; Gilpin et al., 1972). The recent research demonstrated that the mode of action of penicillin-induced explosive lysis of Streptococcus pneumonia, a decades-long puzzle, was also because of autolysin disorder (Flores-Kim et al., 2019). Interestingly, with the assistance of confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, Gao et al. (2017) found that amicoumacin A, secreted by a marine probiotic strain, can damage the surface structure of V. vulnificus cells, as reflected by the formation of cell cavities, the presence of membrane holes, and consequent cell lysis. As a further step, Polikanov et al. (2014) suggested that amicoumacin A, as a potent protein synthesis inhibitor, could interfere with translation by locking the mRNA in the mRNA-binding channel of the 30S subunit. It indicated that amicoumacin A could interfere with bacterial and eukaryotic translation, which could be the reason for its antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties (Itoh et al., 1981; Canedo et al., 1997; Li et al., 2012; Polikanov et al., 2014; Prokhorova et al., 2016). Noteworthy, according to proteomics and metabolomics, Terekhov et al. (2018) revealed a distinct mechanism of Bacillus self-resistance to amicoumacin A, based on a subtle equilibrium of its activation and deactivation by phosphatase AmiO and kinase AmiN, respectively. Understanding the target mechanism of amicoumacin A and the on/off mode of activity switching has the potential to find novel ways of developing therapeutic treatments against aquaculture diseases.

Understanding the target mechanism of amicoumacin A and the on/off mode of activity switching has the potential to find novel ways of developing therapeutic treatments against aquaculture diseases. To interrogate the potential biosynthetic pathway of amicoumacin A, the whole genome sequencing of the strain BSXE-1601 was conducted in our study. Gene clusters related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were predicted based on the analysis with antiSMASH. It revealed that the secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster 7 in the strain BSXE-1601 encoded a hybrid modular polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS), and 17 genes (gene3131-3147) in this cluster were proposed to be responsible for amicoumacin A biosynthesis. Inspection of this genetic locus identified a PKS-NRPS hybrid protein encoded by gene3138, three PKS encoded by gene3134-3136, and two NRPSs encoded by gene3137 and gene3146. This was consistent with the results of Li et al. (2015), who succeeded in the heterologous expression of amicoumacin A biosynthesis genes amiA-O and provided unequivocal evidence that the ami locus encodes amicoumacin biosynthesis. Moreover, with the successful heterologous expression of the amicoumacin biosynthetic gene cluster and the ability to readily inactivate individual ami genes, they identified that inactive preamicoumacin precursors were first synthesized and then hydrolyzed by the asparagine-specific peptidase (encoded by amiB) into the active component amicoumacin A.

Additionally, in the present study, with the antiSMASH analysis, another 9 secondary metabolic gene clusters were found in B. subtilis BSXE-1601 genomes: three encoding NRPSs, two terpene synthases (TSs), one Type III PKS, one trans-Acyl transferase polyketide synthetase (TransATPKS)-otherKS, one TransATPKS-NRPS hybrid, one sactipeptide synthase. The diverse secondary metabolic pathways indicated the high biosynthetic capability of the strain BSXE-1601. Cluster 1, 4, 8, 9, and 10 were highly similar to the known clusters encoding bacillibactin, fengycin, surfactin, bacilysin, and subtilosin A, all of which have antimicrobial/antibacterial activities (Arguelles-Arias et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009). For instance, bacilysin is one of the simplest non-ribosomal peptides produced by B. subtilis, with antagonistic properties against several bacteria and fungi (Kenig and Abraham, 1976). Surfactin, the most powerful biosurfactant known to date, is another NRP which inhibits the biofilm formation of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus (Mireles et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2019). Subtilosin A is one of the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides from B. subtilis, which displayed activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (Shelburne et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009). A large number of beneficial genes BSXE-1601 possessing means that the strain BSXE-1601 may have a high potential to be used as a multifunctional biological agent in aquaculture by suppressing pathogenic microbes of aquatic animals. However, the related functional genes still need to be verified. Since the yields of secondary metabolites differ in different species and even under different culture conditions, the isolation and identification of the biologically active metabolites from B. subtilis BSXE-1601 still need to be investigated for a better understanding of BSXE-1601. Furthermore, because of ecologically adaptive changes, members of B. subtilis exhibit considerable genomic diversity (Earl et al., 2008). Hence, to testify if the biosynthetic capabilities of amicoumacin A, bacillibactin, fengycin, surfactin, bacilysin and subtilosin A are BSXE-1601 specific, a further comparative genome study should be performed between BSXE-1601 and other B. subtilis strains.

Conclusion Conclusion In conclusion, the results may provide new insights into the possible mechanism of antagonistic activity of B. subtilis strain BSXE-1601 against the bacterial pathogens of shrimp. Amicoumacins A, B, and C belonging to isocoumarins, were purified from the cell-free supernatant from the strain BSXE-1601 but only amicoumacin A was demonstrated to be responsible for this anti-Vibrio activity. Our reports gave the first description in which the resistances of amicoumacin A against shrimp pathogens, including the AHPND-causing strain V. parahaemolyticus VPAHPND 2S01. However, whether amicoumacin A specifically targets the primary virulence factor mediating AHPND etiology and mortality in shrimp or not still needs to be clarified. The complete genome sequence of BSXE-1601 aided to elucidate amicoumacin A biosynthetic gene cluster and its potential metabolic pathway. This work may further facilitate the heterologous expression of the natural product amicoumacin A biosynthetic pathway to increase the yield of amicoumacin A. The predicted diverse secondary metabolic pathways indicated the ability of BSXE-1601 to produce a variety of effective antibacterial products, and its high potential to be applied as a multifunctional biological agent in aquaculture by suppressing pathogenic microbes of aquatic animals. Sustainable aquaculture may be assured with the exploration of this modest microbicidal technique.
