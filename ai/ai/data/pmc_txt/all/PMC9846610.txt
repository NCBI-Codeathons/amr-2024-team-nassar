However, the stalks of some varieties are prone to lodging under high density conditions. Much research has been done on the evaluation of maize lodging resistance. But there are few comprehensive reports on the determination of maize lodging resistance in situ without injury under field conditions. This study introduces a non-destructive in situ tester to determine the lodging resistance of the different maize varieties in the field. The force value can be obtained by pulling the stalk to different angles with this instrument, which is used to evaluate the lodging resistance of maize varieties. From 2018 to 2020, a total of 1,172 sample plants from 113 maize varieties were tested for the lodging resistance of plants. The statistical results show that the values of force on maize plants at 45° inclination angles (F45) are appropriate to characterize maize lodging resistance in situ by nondestructive testing in the field. According to the F45 value, the maximum lodging resistance Fmax can be inferred. The formula is: Fmax =1.1354 F45 – 0.3358. The evaluation results of lodging resistance of different varieties of this study are basically consistent with the test results of three-point bending method, moving wind tunnel and other methods. Therefore, the F45 value is the optimal index for nondestructive evaluation of maize stalk-lodging resistance under the field-planting conditions. Introduction Introduction Maize is the most widespread global food and feed crop. Reasonable densing planting can make full use of natural resources and is the most effective way to achieve high-yield and high-efficiency maize cultivation (Li et al., 2017). Increased maize planting density increases harvest ears and grain yield. However, when the planting density increases beyond a certain extent, lodging is prone to occur (Sun et al., 2021). Maize lodging is extremely harmful to production, not only affecting the stalk character of maize and greatly reducing yield and quality, but also bringing difficulties to field management and harvesting (Deng et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Sun and Wang, 2020). Therefore, the accurate evaluation of maize stalk lodging resistance has important practical significance for realizing high-yield and high-efficiency cultivation of maize. Maize is the most widespread global food and feed crop. Reasonable densing planting can make full use of natural resources and is the most effective way to achieve high-yield and high-efficiency maize cultivation (Li et al., 2017). Increased maize planting density increases harvest ears and grain yield. However, when the planting density increases beyond a certain extent, lodging is prone to occur (Sun et al., 2021). Maize lodging is extremely harmful to production, not only affecting the stalk character of maize and greatly reducing yield and quality, but also bringing difficulties to field management and harvesting (Deng et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Sun and Wang, 2020). Therefore, the accurate evaluation of maize stalk lodging resistance has important practical significance for realizing high-yield and high-efficiency cultivation of maize. Maize lodging generally occurs after the jointing stage, and can be caused by storms, cultivation measures, diseases, insect pests, etc., and especially by strong wind, which causes the maize plants to tilt or fall to the ground after rain (Kamara et al., 2003; Sun and Wang, 2020). The lodging of maize plants can occur in three ways: (1) the bending strength of the stalk is not sufficient to resist the external wind pressure and the stalk is broken (the phenomenon of “stem breaking”); (2) the rigidity of the stalk may be sufficient to resist the external wind force, but the root system has insufficient grip to resist the external wind pressure (the phenomenon of “root collapse”); or (3) the root system has a strong grip and can resist the external wind pressure, and the stalk has poor rigidity and is sufficiently tough that it does not break under the external wind pressure (Robertson et al., 2017), but the inclination exceeds 45° (the phenomenon of “stem lodging”). The lodging degree of maize plants can be divided into mild (tilting 0°–30°), moderate (tilting 30°–60°), and severe (above 85°). Different degrees of lodging have different effects on maize yield. Generally, light lodging reduces yield by 10%–20%, moderate lodging reduces yield by 30%–45%, heavy lodging reduces yield by more than 50%, and even more severe lodging can result in a 100% reduction in yield (Huang and Zhang., 2007; Cheng et al., 2011; Li, 2012). Much research has been done on the evaluation of maize lodging resistance. Laboratory methods of testing stem lodging resistance mainly include the crush test (Zuber and Grogan, 1961; Thompson, 1963), the peel penetration test (Peiffer et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014), and the bending test (Kokubo et al., 1989; Ennos et al., 1993; Li et al., 2003; Gou et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2013; Robertson et al., 2014). In addition, if a correlation between various chemical or morphological factors of plants (e.g., stem diameter, stem lignin content, and stem bark thickness) and the lodging resistance of stems is established, it could be used to predict the lodging resistance of plants. However, these methods usually require a great deal of labor and time, and cannot directly determine the lodging resistance in situ of plants in the field. Sibale et al. (1992) measured the puncture resistance of the rind using a modified electronic penetrometer to aid in the selection of plants with higher maize stalk strength. Zhang et al. (2018) evaluated the crushing strength of stems by measuring the force required to break the stems using a hydraulic press. Wen et al. (2019) used a mobile wind turbine to conduct an in situ assessment of the stalk lodging resistance of different maize varieties; this research has shown that a new cumulative lodging index (CLI) is more reliable than mechanical properties, failure wind speed (FWS), and wind speed reduction index (RI) when evaluating lodging resistance in terms of reliability and resolution. Cook et al. (2019) invented a maize lodging resistance tester called Darling that breaks the maize stalk by giving it a thrust at a fixed height to obtain the maximum lodging resistance and bending moment, which can evaluate the lodging resistance of maize stalks in the field. Darling is a device capable of inducing a natural destruction and, as such, the device was destructive in assessing maize lodging resistance. Although methods of measuring maize stem strength are becoming convenient and efficient, they are all performed under controlled conditions and can cause some damage to the plant. There are few comprehensive reports on the determination of maize lodging resistance in situ without damage under field conditions. When testing the lodging resistance of maize plants from jointing stage to mature stages, it is best to use a non-destructive method and the same population (sample); this can not only objectively evaluate the differences of lodging resistance among different genotypes, but effectively reduce the workload and error caused by different populations (samples). Maize researchers urgently need a technology for the evaluation of maize lodging resistance that can achieve non-destructive in situ determination in the field.

Maize researchers urgently need a technology for the evaluation of maize lodging resistance that can achieve non-destructive in situ determination in the field. Therefore, a simple lodging resistance evaluation method was developed in situ for maize plants in the field, which showed simple, fast, efficient and accurate determination of maize lodging resistance. The instrument used the lever principle to pull the maize plants to different angles and measure the real-time pulling force at different angles, which performed the synchronous acquisition of the three parameters of angle, force and displacement (i.e., distance between the main machine and the rotating shaft of the tester). The testing instrument is used to determine the maize lodging resistance using non-destructive measurement in situ. The goals of the current study were (1) to establish a simple method for evaluating lodging resistance in the field and (2) to quantify the plant lodging resistance of different maize varieties.

When the tilt angle was below 45°, the breaking ratio was relatively low. When tilt angle was between 5° and 40° the cumulative proportion of breaking plants was 10.41%; at 45° the proportion was 4.27%, and at 50° the proportion was 11.60%, indicating that a plant tilt angle of 45° was the critical point for a significant decrease in the survival rate of plants. The proportion of plants breaking increases slowly as tilt angle increases up to<45°, and the survival rate of plants has a curve slope of –0.3527; when the tilt angle goes beyond 45°, the survival rate of plants decreases quickly, accompanied by a curve slope of –1.8749 (

The traits of plants from different varieties, planting density, and development period were principal factors for the lodging resistance of maize plants. The planting density usually is negatively associated with F
max, that is, higher planting density usually led to a lower F
max. Under low-density conditions, the differences of varieties are significant, that is, the data of lodging resistance from a population consisting of different varieties show great heterogeneity, while at high density, the differences between varieties become smaller. Maize plants at different developmental stages or in different reproductive periods show obvious differences in lodging resistance. From

Discussion Discussion Advantages of non-destructive testing in the field Advantages of non-destructive testing in the field Advantages of non-destructive testing in the field In 2019, Cook published a paper in which a lodging resistance tester, Darling, was developed. Darling was the first instrument for the lodging resistance measurement of crops in the field. The Darling tester produces a thrust at a fixed height to assess the lodging resistance of maize and sorghum, but actually evaluates the strength and toughness of the plant stalk. The Darling uses a destructive test for maximum lodging resistance. In 2019, Cook published a paper in which a lodging resistance tester, Darling, was developed.

The Darling uses a destructive test for maximum lodging resistance. The purpose of our test is to assess the lodging resistance of plants in a non-destructive way, which is important for the selection of commercial cultivars and cultivation of crops. For the lack of appropriate tools and test methods, the maximum lodging resistance of plants was determined and used to evaluate the maize lodging resistance, which is based on the stalk-breaking of plants and tensile strength from different angles, and inevitably causes the breaking of plants, resulting in maize plants that could not grow normally after the test. In order to evaluate maize lodging resistance in maize without injuring the plant, the maize stalk breaking rate and tensile value at different angles were determined. F
45 gave an index of maize lodging resistance with a very low breaking rate, and from the correspondence between F
max and F

By using digital detector FGJ-5, the stem breaking resistance of different varieties of maize was rated as XY335 > ZD958 > XD20, and the bending resistance of plant was ZD958 > XD20 (Cheng, 2010). By using a mobile wind tunnel to detect lodging resistance, Wen rated the wind resistance performance of different varieties as XY335 > ZD958 > XD20 (Wen et al., 2019). The results from non-destructive testing used in this study were nearly identical. Conclusion Conclusion This non-destructive in situ method can test the lodging resistance of a maize stem by determining the angle values of bending plant in constant pull force, or reading the values of pull force on a plant that is inclined 45°°, based on the force strength on the plants in the field, composed of gravity and wind force. Non-destructive determination for maize lodging resistance in the field by using the lodging resistance tester can be successfully performed. The accuracy of the method was examined with different plants of 113 varieties for 3 years under different planting densities and developmental periods. F
45 on maize plants at a 45° inclination was suitable to characterize maize lodging resistance in the field, and was the best index for the evaluation of maize lodging resistance in this study. According to the F
45 value, the maximum lodging resistance F
max can be inferred, and the formula is F
max = 1.1354F
45 – 0.3358.
