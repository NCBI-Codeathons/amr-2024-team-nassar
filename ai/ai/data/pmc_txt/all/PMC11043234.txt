Doxorubicin is an important class of anthracycline antitumor antibiotics produced by Streptomyces peucetius. The doxorubicin fermentation yield of the wild-type strain was very low, so it could not be produced directly by fermentation at an industrial scale due to the high cost. In the present study, S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 was obtained from SIPI-14 through several rounds of doxorubicin resistance screening. Then, the ketoreductase gene dnrU was knocked out to reduce (13S)-13-dihydrodaunorubicin production, and the resistance gene drrC was overexpressed to further enhance resistance to doxorubicin. The resulting engineered strain S. peucetius △U1/drrC produced 1128 mg/L doxorubicin, a 102.1% increase compared to that of SIPI-14. Then, fermentation medium was optimized using the response surface method. In the optimized fermentation medium, the yield of doxorubicin was increased to 1406 mg/L in shake flask on the 7th day. Furthermore, batch culture was carried out in a 10 L fermenter, and the concentration of doxorubicin reached 1461 mg/L after 7 days of culture, which was the highest yield reported to date, indicating the potential for industrial production of doxorubicin by fermentation.

Keywords Introduction Introduction Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic, and its analogs include daunorubicin, epirubicin and idarubicin. As a chemical drug, doxorubicin has a broad array of anticancer activities and is used to treat various cancers, especially hemangioma and solid tumors (Mattioli et al. 2023). For most cancers, doxorubicin remains a first-line chemotherapy agent, either alone or in combination (Sritharan and Sivalingam 2021; Turinetto et al. 2023). At present, daunorubicin is produced by fermentation, followed by separation, purification and chemical synthesis to produce doxorubicin. Chemical synthesis requires side chain group protection and deprotection, polluting the environment and having high production costs. In 1969, it was first reported that doxorubicin is produced in S. peucetius ATCC27952 by fermentation (Arcamone et al. 1969). The use of doxorubicin directly obtained by fermentation is limited by the low titer used during fermentation. If a large amount of doxorubicin can be obtained directly by fermentation through a high-yielding strain and by optimizing the fermentation process, this approach will be an environmentally friendly and efficient method.

The use of doxorubicin directly obtained by fermentation is limited by the low titer used during fermentation. If a large amount of doxorubicin can be obtained directly by fermentation through a high-yielding strain and by optimizing the fermentation process, this approach will be an environmentally friendly and efficient method. The biosynthetic pathway of doxorubicin can be divided into three main pathways (Gao et al. 2022; Hutchinson and Colombo 1999). The synthesis of ɛ-rhodomycinone is the first pathway involved. Under the action of a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) encoded by the dpsABCDGEFY genes, 12-deoxyacranic acid is synthesized by a multistep reaction with propionyl CoA as the starting unit and malonyl CoA as the extension unit. Then, the ɛ-rhodomycinone aglycone is produced by oxygenase, methyltransferase, cyclization and reductase. The second synthesis pathway of doxorubicin is that of TDP-L-daunosamine. Through a six-step reaction, D-glucose-1-phosphate from the central metabolic pathway is synthesized to produce TDP-L-daunosamine, which involves a cluster of dnm genes, including dnmL, dnmM, dnmU, dnmT, dnmJ, and dnmV. Finally, glycosylation and postmodification of daunorubicin and doxorubicin occur. Rhodomycin-D is produced by ɛ-rhodomycinone and TDP-L-daurosamine through the action of glycosyltransferase. After postmodification (demethylation, decarboxylation and hydroxylation), daunorubicin and doxorubicin are obtained. In the branch pathway, daunorubicin is converted to 13(S)-13-dihydrodaunorubicin via catalysis by the enzyme encoded by the dnrU gene. Moreover, daunorubicin and doxorubicin are converted into acid-sensitive baumycin by the enzymes encoded by the genes dnrH and dnrX, as shown in Additional file: Fig. S1.

In S. peucetitus ATCC 27,952, the yield of doxorubicin is low, making its large-scale production difficult and high-cost. To address this problem, several efforts have been made to increase the production of doxorubicin by genetic engineering. Based on the biosynthetic pathway of doxorubicin, its production may be limited by several key enzymes, such as glycosylated genes and a P450 enzyme DoxA. Therefore, they were engineered to increase the fermentation yield of doxorubicin. The overexpression of glycosylated genes has been utilized to increase the fermentation yield of doxorubicin. Malla (Malla et al. 2009) achieved a 5.6-fold increase in doxorubicin production (approximately 10 mg/L) by simultaneously overexpressing the gene glycosyltransferase dnrS/dnrQ and the sugar synthesis pathway gene desIII/desIV. Recently, Zhang (Zhang et al. 2023a) obtained a DoxA mutant, DoxA(P88Y), showed a 56% increase in the conversion efficiency of daunorubicin to doxorubicin. These results indicated that some enzymes are limiting factors in the biosynthetic pathway and their engineering is an important approach to improve doxorubicin production. In addition, it was reported that the synthesis of the secondary metabolite doxorubicin is tightly regulated. The fermentation yield of doxorubicin was increased by disrupting negative regulatory genes and overexpressing positive regulatory genes. Noh(Noh et al. 2010)enhanced the doxorubicin fermentation yield by approximately 35% (approximately 75 mg/L) by disrupting the downregulation of the gene wblA. In addition, the expression of the AfsR homologous regulatory gene (AfsR-p) in S. peucetius ATCC27952 led to a 4-fold increase in doxorubicin production (approximately 80 mg/L) (Parajuli et al. 2005). ParK (Park et al. 2005) increased the fermentation yield of doxorubicin by 30.8-fold (approximately 11 mg/L) through the overexpression of the regulatory gene dnrI in a high-copy-number plasmid combined with the optimization of the medium. Moreover, Malla(Malla et al. 2010a) increased the fermentation yield of doxorubicin by 4.3 times (approximately 7 mg/L) by simultaneously overexpressing the regulatory gene dnrN-dnrI-afsR. However, in all these studies, improving the yield of doxorubicin were focused on wild-type strains with low doxorubicin yields. Therefore, genetic modification of high-yielding strains is important for industrial application.

In our previous study, we generated a S. peucetius SIPI-14 strain with significantly improved doxorubicin levels by combining the traditional method of UV and ARTP mutagenesis (Wang et al. 2018). In the present study, a strain with doxorubicin resistance was obtained from SIPI-14 for further genetic modification combined with fermentation medium optimization to significantly improve the yield of doxorubicin, which laid a foundation for the large-scale industrial production of doxorubicin by direct fermentation in the future.

The S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 genome was used as a template to obtain the 1121 bp upstream and 1450 bp downstream homology arms of dnrU by PCR amplification with the primers dnrU-UP-F/R and dnrU-DOWN-F/R. The upstream and downstream homology arms were fused together by overlapping PCR with the primers dnrU-UP-F/dnrU-DOWN-R. The PCR product was digested with HindIII/XbaI and then assembled on the pSET vector to construct the plasmid pSET-△dnrU (Additional file: Fig. S2a), which was used to delete the dnrU gene.

Results Results Doxorubicin resistance screening Doxorubicin resistance screening Doxorubicin resistance screening S. peucetius SIPI-14, which has significantly increased doxorubicin levels, was generated by traditional mutagenesis in our study (Wang et al. 2018). Due to its strong cytotoxicity, doxorubicin has a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of S. peucetius strains themselves. In this study, doxorubicin was added to the seed medium to obtain strains with greater doxorubicin resistance through continuous resistance pressure screening. Initially, 50 mg/L doxorubicin was added to the liquid medium. After continuous cultivation, the concentration of doxorubicin in the seed medium was gradually increased from 50 mg/L to 150 mg/L to screen for high-yielding strains that could grow in a resistant environment (Fig. 1a). Through continuous doxorubicin resistance screening, the biomass of the strains gradually increased from 12.5 to 14.8%, and the ability to produce doxorubicin was significantly enhanced. The high-yielding strain SIPI-7-14 was selected from seed medium containing 150 mg/L doxorubicin. The yield of doxorubicin reached 847 mg/L, which was 51.7% greater than that of SIPI-14 (Fig. 1b).

Therefore, genetic engineering was selected for strain modification. After producing daunorubicin and doxorubicin, the strains could also produce byproducts. According to the branch biosynthetic pathway of doxorubicin shown in Additional file: Fig. S1, the dnrU gene in the branch metabolic pathway encodes a ketoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of the intermediate daunorubicin at position C-13 to form 13-dihydrodaunorubicin. The genes dnrH and dnrX encode enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of baumycin-like glycosides from daunorubicin and doxorubicin. In this study, homologous double-crossover recombination was used to knock out the 351 bp fragment of dnrU (Fig. 2a) to obtain the ΔU1 mutant. The parent strain SIPI-7-14 and the ΔU1 mutant were confirmed by PCR (Fig. 2b). △H4 and △X1 were obtained using the same method by deleting dnrH and dnrX (Fig. 2d and e), respectively. The biomass of the engineered strain △U1 decreased slightly compared to that of the parental strain SIPI-7-14, from 15 to 14%. However, the yield of doxorubicin produced by the engineered strain △U1 was 1005 mg/L, which was 21.5% greater than that produced by the parental strain. However, when the branch pathway genes dnrH and dnrX were knocked out, the yield of doxorubicin in the knockout strains △H4 and △X1 decreased (Fig. 2c).

The error bars indicate the standard deviations Overexpression of the resistance genes drrC, drrAB, drrD or drrABC increases doxorubicin production Overexpression of the resistance genes drrC, drrAB, drrD or drrABC increases doxorubicin production Overexpression of the resistance genes drrC, drrAB, drrD or drrABC increases doxorubicin production Antibiotic-producing actinomycetes maintain self-resistance through the presence of resistance genes. In contrast to the ATP-dependent efflux pump mechanism composed of drrA and drrB (Kaur 1997; Li et al. 2014), the drrC gene encodes a UvrA-like protein that binds to DNA and can remove daunorubicin from the insertion site, thus enabling actinomycetes to tolerate their own products (Lomovskaya et al. 1996; Prija and Prasad 2017). The integrated plasmid pSET152 was used to overexpress the drrC, drrAB and drrD genes in the strain △U1 to obtain the engineered strains △U1/drrC, △U1/drrAB and △U1/drrD, respectively. The engineered strains were verified by shake flask fermentation. The doxorubicin yield of the engineered strain △U1/drrC was 13.2% greater than that of the parental strain △U1, reaching 1128 mg/L (Fig. 2f). The engineered strain △U1/drrAB produced 1098 mg/L doxorubicin. However, the engineered strain △U1/drrD produced 1010 mg/L doxorubicin in a shake flask, which was almost the same as that of the parental strain. Furthermore, the drrAB and drrC genes were overexpressed in the △U1 strain to obtain the engineered strain △U1/drrABC. However, the combined overexpression of the drrAB and drrC genes resulted in a lower fermentation yield than the single expression of drrC. In conclusion, the engineered strain △U1/drrC produced the highest fermentation yield in shake flasks. The transcription levels of the drrC gene in the engineered strain △U1/drrC and the parental strain △U1 were subsequently analyzed. The transcription level of drrC in △U1 decreased significantly during the culture process. The transcription level of drrC in the strain △U1/drrC was significantly greater than that in the △U1 strain (Fig. 2g).

In addition to maltodextrin and dry yeast powder, we also found that calcium salts affect the synthesis of doxorubicin. The effects of four different calcium sources, calcium pantothenate, Ca(NO3)2, CaSO4 and CaCl2, on the yield of doxorubicin fermentation were studied, and CaCl2 was shown to improve the production of doxorubicin (Fig. 3g). Therefore, S. peucetius △U1/drrC cultured in fermentation media supplemented with different concentrations of CaCl2 were investigated in shake flasks. When the concentration of CaCl2 was 0.6%, the yield of doxorubicin increased by 11.3%, reaching 1228 mg/L (Fig. 3h).

For the response surface optimization experiment, a total of 17 formulations were designed (as shown in Additional file: Table S3), each with three parallel shake flasks.

There was no significant difference in the fermentation yield of △U1/drrC between the optimized formula and the original formula during the five days of shaking flask fermentation. However, with the optimized formula, △U1/drrC produced more products after the 6th day, and the highest yield of doxorubicin was 1406 mg/L on the 7th day (Fig. 4c). On the 6th day, the yield of doxorubicin reached 1340 mg/L (Fig. 4c), which was very close to the model-predicted value of 1323 mg/L, indicating that the prediction model was effective. The optimized formulation was more suitable for the growth of △U1/drrC; Thus, having more biomass resulted in a greater doxorubicin yield (Fig. 4b). In addition, the pH of the optimized formulation was maintained between 6.4 and 6.6, which was lower than that of the original formulation, indicating that the strain underwent a slower aging reaction in the new medium than in the other media, thereby increasing the fermentation period (Fig. 4a). There was no significant difference in the fermentation yield of △U1/drrC between the optimized formula and the original formula during the five days of shaking flask fermentation. However, with the optimized formula, △U1/drrC produced more products after the 6th day, and the highest yield of doxorubicin was 1406 mg/L on the 7th day (Fig. 4c).

The optimized formulation was more suitable for the growth of △U1/drrC; Thus, having more biomass resulted in a greater doxorubicin yield (Fig. 4b). In addition, the pH of the optimized formulation was maintained between 6.4 and 6.6, which was lower than that of the original formulation, indicating that the strain underwent a slower aging reaction in the new medium than in the other media, thereby increasing the fermentation period (Fig. 4a). There was no significant difference in the fermentation yield of △U1/drrC between the optimized formula and the original formula during the five days of shaking flask fermentation. However, with the optimized formula, △U1/drrC produced more products after the 6th day, and the highest yield of doxorubicin was 1406 mg/L on the 7th day (Fig. 4c).

Batch culture of △U1/drrC in 10 L fermenter for doxorubicin production Batch culture of △U1/drrC in 10 L fermenter for doxorubicin production Batch culture of △U1/drrC in 10 L fermenter for doxorubicin production To further expand the scale of cultivation, fermentation was carried out in a 10 L fermenter using the original and optimized media with S. peucetius △U1/drrC (Fig. 4d and e). In the original formulation, the agitation increased rapidly during the first three days, at which point the strain grew rapidly. The biomass of the strain reached a maximum of 15% on the 4th day. The titer of doxorubicin reached 1158 mg/L on the 5th day of fermentation. During fermentation, the trend of the change in pH first increased, then decreased, and finally increased again. The fermentation period was short, and the biomass decreased rapidly (Fig. 4d). With the optimized formula, the growth rate increased rapidly in the first two days, the strains grew rapidly, and the biomass was slightly greater than that of the original formulation, reaching 15.5%; However, the biomass was maintained for a longer time. The trend of the pH change in the optimized formulation was consistent with that in the original formulation, but the pH was maintained at approximately 6.4 during the later period, which was lower than that of the original formulation. The duration of doxorubicin production in the optimized formulation was longer, probably because the biomass in the optimized formulation was maintained for a longer time, and a lower pH was more favorable for strain production. The yield of doxorubicin reached a maximum of 1461 mg/L on the 7th day (Fig. 4e), which was slightly greater than the yield of the shaker culture. To further expand the scale of cultivation, fermentation was carried out in a 10 L fermenter using the original and optimized media with S. peucetius △U1/drrC (Fig. 4d and e). In the original formulation, the agitation increased rapidly during the first three days, at which point the strain grew rapidly. The biomass of the strain reached a maximum of 15% on the 4th day.

The cytotoxicity of doxorubicin can inhibit the growth of S. peucetius and hinder product production. In our study, S. peucetius was continuously cultivated in seed medium containing doxorubicin, which made the strains more tolerant to the toxicity of their own products. By adaptive evolution, the resulted S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 showed higher biomass and doxorubicin yield than that of S. peucetius SIPI-14. The high-yielding strains can be used as better cell factories for doxorubicin production. To further increase the product tolerance, overexpression of resistance genes is another widely applied approach. Cellular resistance in S. peucetius is mediated by genes, including drrA, drrB, drrC and drrD (Karuppasamy et al. 2015). An efflux pump composed of the proteins drrA and drrB removes doxorubicin from cells (Kaur 1997). Like UvrA, the protein drrC may recognize and eliminate daunorubicin, which is embedded in DNA, thus allowing DNA replication and transcription to continue (Prija and Prasad 2017). Expression of drrC in the Escherichia coli uvrA strain can significantly increase the daunorubicin resistance of the strain (Lomovskaya et al. 1996). Directly downstream of drrA and drrB lies drrD, which is involved in self-resistance as well. S. peucetius drrD deletion mutant showed reduced self-resistance, but the molecular mechanism has not yet been known (Karuppasamy et al. 2015). In our study, overexpression of drrA and drrB resulted in an increase in the production of doxorubicin. In addition, overexpression of the resistance gene drrC produced 1128 mg/L doxorubicin, a 102.1% increase compared to that of SIPI-14. However, the combination of the genes drrA, drrB and drrC did not result in a greater yield than did the overexpression of drrC alone. This phenomenon is consistent with the findings of previous reports in the literature, in which the expression of both resistance systems was shown to be worse than the expression of an individual resistance system (Malla et al. 2010b). We have also tried to overexpress drrD in △U1, but the strain showed almost the same productivity as the parental strain. Secondary metabolites are generally toxic to their producers.

We have also tried to overexpress drrD in △U1, but the strain showed almost the same productivity as the parental strain. Secondary metabolites can generally be enhanced by deleting genes of competing pathways. In the pathway of doxorubicin biosynthesis, the dnrU coding product can catalyze daunorubicin to produce byproducts, while the dnrH and dnrX coding products can use daunorubicin and doxorubicin to produce baumycin analogs. It was reported that in S. peucetius 29,050, blocking the dnrU and dnrX increased the yield of doxorubicin by three times, compared with that of the parent strain. Inactivation of dnrH led to an 8.5-fold increase in daunorubicin production and doxorubicin production also increased (Lomovskaya et al. 1998, 1999; Scotti and Hutchinson 1996). In this study, gene dnrU was disrupted in the S. peucetiuss SIPI-7-14 and the yield of doxorubicin was 21.5% greater than that of the parent strain. However, the higher fold enhancement reported in the literature may be due to the low yield of the original strain. Surprisingly, after deletion of the branch genes dnrH and dnrX, the yield of doxorubicin decreased instead, which is inconsistent with the findings of previous reports. The biomass of the engineered strain △H4 and △X1 decreased compared to that of the parental strain SIPI-7-14, from 15 to 11% and 12%, respectively. We speculated that the toxicity of doxorubicin is higher than the glycosylated product baumycin, which has a great effect on the growth of S. peucetius. The baumycin is sensitive to acid and can be easily converted into doxorubicin by adjusting the pH to 1.5–1.8, so it will not affect the doxorubicin yield. These results indicate that there is a significant difference in the results of genetic engineering modification between high-yielding strain and wild-type strain.

These results indicate that there is a significant difference in the results of genetic engineering modification between high-yielding strain and wild-type strain. As the genetic background of strains changed after genetic engineering, it is necessary to optimize the medium or culture conditions to explore the production potential of engineered strains. This phenomenon has also been found in other strains(Li et al. 2022; Wan et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2023b). RSM was widely used to design experiments and determine the optimal medium with fewer experimental trials and obtain more responses at the same time. The medium obtained through RSM method was better than previously reported single-factor optimization. The production of doxorubicin reached 1406 mg/L in the shake flask on the 7th day, which was 24.6% higher than before.

In conclusion, the yield of doxorubicin can be effectively improved by combination of resistance screening, genetic engineering and optimization of culture media, a 150.6% increase compared with the parent strain SIPI-14, which was the highest reported so far (Table 2). This will make it possible to produce doxorubicin through one-step fermentation instead of existing chemical semi-synthetic production method. Meanwhile, some other products derived from actinomyces fermentation can also use this strategy to improve the fermentation yield.
