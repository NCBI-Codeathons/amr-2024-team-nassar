Abstract The zeamines produced by Dickeya oryzae are potent polyamine antibiotics and phytotoxins that are essential for bacterial virulence. We recently showed that the RND efflux pump DesABC in D. oryzae confers partial resistance to zeamines. To fully elucidate the bacterial self‐protection mechanisms, in this study we used transposon mutagenesis to identify the genes encoding proteins involved in zeamine resistance in D. oryzae EC1. This led to the identification of a seven‐gene operon, arn
EC1, that encodes enzyme homologues associated with lipopolysaccharide modification. Deletion of the arn
EC1 genes in strain EC1 compromised its zeamine resistance 8‐ to 16‐fold. Further deletion of the des gene in the arn
EC1 mutant background reduced zeamine resistance to a level similar to that of the zeamine‐sensitive Escherichia coli DH5α. Intriguingly, the arn
EC1 mutants showed varied bacterial virulence on rice, potato, and Chinese cabbage. Further analyses demonstrated that ArnBCATEC1 are involved in maintenance of the bacterial nonmucoid morphotype by repressing the expression of capsular polysaccharide genes and that ArnBEC1 is a bacterial virulence determinant, influencing transcriptional expression of over 650 genes and playing a key role in modulating bacterial motility and virulence. Taken together, these findings decipher a novel zeamine resistance mechanism in D. oryzae and document new roles of the Arn enzymes in modulation of bacterial physiology and virulence. The arn
EC1 genes play multiple roles in bacterial physiology and virulence in Dickeya oryzae. Liang, Z.

INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Dickeya oryzae is a gram‐negative bacterial plant pathogen, recently separated from Dickeya zeae (Wang et al., 2020). The diseases caused by D. oryzae pose a great threat to rice production in Asian and European countries and potato production in Australia (Bertani et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Pritchard et al., 2013). Unlike most Dickeya species, which infect only dicot plants, D. oryzae is capable of infecting both monocot and dicot plants (Hussain et al., 2008). Similar to the well‐studied Dickeya dadantii (Reverchon & Nasser, 2013), D. oryzae produces various cell wall‐degrading enzymes that contribute to its virulence and pathogenesis (Lv et al., 2018; Reverchon & Nasser, 2013; Zhou et al., 2016). In addition, our recent studies unveiled two key virulence determinants in D. oryzae, that is, bacterial motility and the group of zeamine phytotoxins. Mutants defective in cell motility are severely compromised in rice seed invasion and systemic infection (Chen et al., 2020, 2022; Hussain et al., 2008; Lv et al., 2018, 2022; Shi et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2016). Zeamines are a group of structurally related polyamine compounds produced by D. oryzae, which are phytotoxins that inhibit rice seed germination and damage plant tissues (Cheng et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2011). Inactivation of zmsA, a key gene required for zeamine biosynthesis, drastically reduces the virulence of D. oryzae EC1 against rice, Chinese cabbage, and potato (Zhou et al., 2011).

Mutants defective in cell motility are severely compromised in rice seed invasion and systemic infection (Chen et al., 2020, 2022; Hussain et al., 2008; Lv et al., 2018, 2022; Shi et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2016). Zeamines are a group of structurally related polyamine compounds produced by D. oryzae, which are phytotoxins that inhibit rice seed germination and damage plant tissues (Cheng et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2011). Inactivation of zmsA, a key gene required for zeamine biosynthesis, drastically reduces the virulence of D. oryzae EC1 against rice, Chinese cabbage, and potato (Zhou et al., 2011). In addition to their role as phytotoxins, zeamines are also potent antimicrobial agents with broad‐spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and oomycetes (Hellberg et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2015; Masschelein, Clauwers, Awodi, et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2010). Zeamines inhibit bacterial growth by damaging the cell envelope of gram‐negative bacteria in a way similar to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) (Masschelein, Clauwers, Stalmans et al., 2015). As a producer of zeamines, self‐protection mechanisms against these polyamine antimicrobials are of vital importance for the survival and growth of D. oryzae, with which the pathogen could tolerate a several‐hundred‐fold higher dose of zeamines than zeamine‐sensitive bacterial species such as Escherichia coli (Liang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2010). We found recently that zeamines could induce the expression of the desAB genes, which encode components of the zeamine‐specific RND (RND refers to resistance, nodulation, and cell division) efflux pump DesABC (Liang et al., 2019). However, given that the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of zeamines for D. oryzae EC1 was more than 500‐fold higher than that for the zeamine‐sensitive strain E. coli DH5α, but only 8‐ to 32‐fold higher than those for the desABC gene mutants, we hypothesized that DesABC might not represent the sole zeamine resistance mechanism in D. oryzae (Liang et al., 2019). In addition to their role as phytotoxins, zeamines are also potent antimicrobial agents with broad‐spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and oomycetes (Hellberg et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2015; Masschelein, Clauwers, Awodi, et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2010).

The arn (arnBCADTEF) or pmr (pmrHFIJKLM) operon is widely conserved in gram‐negative bacterial species, including the pathogenic strains belonging to Salmonella enterica (Gunn et al., 2000), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (McPhee et al., 2003), Yersinia pestis (Winfield et al., 2005), Proteus mirabilis (Jiang et al., 2010), Serratia marcescens (Lin et al., 2014), Proteus vulgaris (Baron et al., 2018), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Cheung et al., 2020), and D. dadantii (Costechareyre et al., 2013). The products of the arn operon are responsible for the biosynthesis of 4‐amino‐4‐deoxy‐l‐arabinose (l‐Ara4N) and transfer of l‐Ara4N to the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cell envelope of gram‐negative bacteria (Breazeale et al., 2005; Trent et al., 2001; Yan et al., 2007). As addition of l‐Ara4N creates a positively charged LPS that could minimize the binding of CAMPs, the Arn LPS modification system thus becomes an important bacterial resistance mechanism against CAMPs such as polymyxins (Gunn et al., 2000; Poirel et al., 2017). It was also noted that inactivation of the arn genes could weaken bacterial virulence, which was believed to be due to poor survival of the arn mutants in the presence of antimicrobial peptides from host organisms (Costechareyre et al., 2013; Gunn et al., 2000).

To elucidate the uncharacterized zeamine resistance mechanisms in D. oryzae, we generated transposon insertional mutants using the zeamine‐minus mutant ∆zmsA as the parental strain, which was derived from D. oryzae EC1 (Zhou et al., 2011), and screened for mutants with increased zeamine sensitivity. We found that mutation of the arn homologues (designated as the arn
EC1 genes) in strain ∆zmsA significantly decreased its resistance to zeamines and polymyxin B. Intriguingly, the individual mutants of the arn
EC1 genes showed substantially varied levels of virulence against rice, Chinese cabbage, and potato, which led us to speculate that the arn
EC1 products may have other biological functions in addition to their role in zeamine and CAMP resistance. Subsequent analyses unravelled the role of ArnBCATEC1 in maintaining the nonmucoid morphotype of D. oryzae EC1 and the implication of ArnBEC1 in modulation of bacterial cell division and motility.

RESULTS RESULTS Identification of zeamine resistance genes in D. oryzae Identification of zeamine resistance genes in D. oryzae Identification of zeamine resistance genes in D. oryzae To identify zeamine resistance genes in D. oryzae EC1, its zeamine‐minus mutant ∆zmsA was mutated with the mariner‐based transposon carried by pBT20 (Seet & Zhang, 2011). Mutant ∆zmsA was chosen for transposon mutagenesis to eliminate a putative toxic effect of the self‐produced zeamines on the growth of transposon insertional mutants that are sensitive to zeamines. The resultant library was screened for mutants with altered sensitivity to zeamines. After screening about 11,800 transposon insertional mutants, nine mutants designated as Zs1–Zs9 showing higher levels of zeamine sensitivity than the parental strain ∆zmsA were obtained. The flanking regions adjacent to the insertion sites were amplified by fusion primer and nested integrated PCR (FPNI‐PCR; Wang et al., 2011) and sequenced for BLASTn analysis to localize the insertion sites. The results showed that the mutants Zs1–Zs9 harbour transposon insertions within a putative seven‐gene operon (Figure 1a, Table S1), which shows over 88% similarity at the nucleotide level to the previously characterized arn operon of D. dadantii 3937 (Costechareyre et al., 2013). This putative operon was hence named the arn
EC1 operon (Figure 1a) and selected for subsequent analysis. Two Zs mutants, Zs4 and Zs7, with transposon insertions in the arnA
EC1 and arnT
EC1 genes, respectively, were randomly selected for the MIC assay. The results showed that they were 8‐fold more sensitive to zeamines than their parental strain ∆zmsA. In trans expression of arnT
EC1 in the mutant Zs7 fully restored its zeamine resistance to the level of strain ∆zmsA (Table 1), suggesting that the arn

EC1 operon also shares a conserved genetic organization with the arn operon (the pmr operon) in S. enterica (Figure 1a) (Gunn et al., 2000). Reverse transcription‐PCR (RT‐PCR) results indicated that these seven genes were cotranscribed in a way similar to their homologues in S. enterica (Figure 1b) (Gunn et al., 2000). In S. enterica, the arn operon confers bacterial resistance to polymyxin B, which also acts by damaging the bacterial cell envelope, similar to zeamines (Masschelein, Clauwers, Stalmans, et al., 2015). To further elucidate the roles of the arn
EC1 operon, in‐frame deletion mutants of arnBCADT
EC1 were generated in the background of the mutant ∆zmsA. MIC assay results showed that inactivation of these arn
EC1 operon genes resulted in an over 8‐fold decrease in the MIC of zeamines and an over 300‐fold decrease in the MIC of polymyxin B (Table 1). Conversely, in trans expression of the corresponding arn
EC1 genes, except for arnE
EC1 and arnF
EC1, in the mutants could fully restore the MICs of zeamines and polymyxin B (Table 1). These findings established the key roles of the arn
EC1 operon in conferring zeamine and polymyxin B resistance in D. oryzae. Bioinformatics analysis showed that in the arn

EC1 (NCBI accession no. W909_RS19715) and arnF
EC1 (NCBI accession no. W909_RS19720), encode two putative l‐Ara4N‐phosphoundecaprenol flippase subunits. The proteins encoded by the arn
EC1 genes have high levels of similarity (above 57%) with their counterparts in S. enterica (McClelland et al., 2001), P. aeruginosa (McPhee et al., 2003), and D. dadantii (Costechareyre et al., 2013) (Table S3). In addition, the arn

EC1, in the mutants could fully restore the MICs of zeamines and polymyxin B (Table 1). These findings established the key roles of the arn

EC1 operon in LPS modification and thus resistance to CAMPs, the arn
EC1 operon from D. oryzae EC1 was cloned and introduced into D. dadantii 3937, a zeamine‐ and polymyxin B‐sensitive strain (Table 1), together with the ugd
EC1 gene (NCBI accession no. W909_RS06165), whose homologue in E. coli was found to be epistatic to the arn operon for lipid A modification (Yan et al., 2007). MIC assay results indicated that heterologous expression of the arn
EC1 operon and the ugd
EC1 gene in D. dadantii 3937 could increase bacterial resistance to zeamines and particularly polymyxin B (Table 1). These findings suggest that the arn
EC1 operon from D. oryzae EC1 could effectively modify and reinforce the cell envelope of D. dadantii 3937, conferring strong resistance to the CAMP polymyxin B as well as zeamines. To further validate the role of the arn

Our previous study unveiled that the RND efflux pump DesABC plays a key role in zeamine resistance in D. oryzae EC1. Inactivation of desB resulted in an about eightfold decrease in the MIC of zeamines (Liang et al., 2019). Similarly, inactivation of arnB
EC1 in the zmsA mutant background resulted in a 16‐fold decrease in the MIC of zeamines (Table 1). To test the synergistic effect of the DesABC efflux pump and the Arn LPS modification system, we generated a triple deletion mutant, ∆zmsA∆arnB
EC1∆desB, which showed a 128‐fold decrease in the MIC of zeamines compared to the parental strain ∆zmsA (Table 1). Significantly, double deletion of arnB
EC1/desB brought down the MIC to the level of the zeamine‐sensitive E. coli DH5α (Table 1), suggesting that the DesABC efflux pump and the Arn LPS modification system are dominant self‐protection mechanisms of D. oryzae against its self‐produced zeamines.

EC1 operon is also zeamine‐dependent, the promoter region of the arn
EC1 operon was fused with the gfp‐coding region in plasmid pPROBE‐NT (Miller et al., 2000) to generate the reporter construct pArnEC1gfp. The relative fluorescence of the wild‐type strain EC1 and the zeamine‐minus mutant ∆zmsA harbouring the pArnEC1gfp construct, that is, EC1(pArnEC1gfp) and ∆zmsA(pArnEC1gfp), was determined in LS5 medium, which was optimized for zeamine production (Liao et al., 2014). The results showed that the relative fluorescence of EC1(pArnEC1gfp) increased along with the growth of D. oryzae EC1 (Figure 2a,b), suggesting that expression of the arn
EC1 operon is growth‐dependent. In addition, the relative fluorescence of EC1(pArnEC1gfp) and ∆zmsA(pArnEC1gfp) was comparable at different bacterial growth stages (Figure 2c), suggesting that unlike desAB, whose expression could be triggered by zeamines (Liang et al., 2019), expression of the arn
EC1 operon is independent of the exposure of zeamines. Moreover, the relative fluorescence of EC1(pArnEC1gfp) was higher than the relative fluorescence of EC1(pDesABgfp), a desAB reporter strain for determining desAB expression in the wild‐type strain EC1 (Liang et al., 2019), at different bacterial growth stages, especially at the early one when zeamines were not highly accumulated (Figure 2a,d), suggesting that the arn

EC1 in in‐frame deletion mutants was assayed against rice seeds, Chinese cabbage, and potato tubers. The results showed that compared to the wild‐type strain EC1, the virulence of the five single mutants with one of the arnBCADT
EC1 genes deleted was attenuated in inhibition of rice seed germination when challenged with 108‐fold dilutions of cell resuspensions (Figure 3a).

EC1 in‐frame deletion mutants, we noticed that inactivation of any of the arnBCAT
EC1 genes resulted in a phenotypic conversion from nonmucoid to mucoid when bacterial strains were cultured on minimal medium (MM) agar plates supplemented with 5% (wt/vol) sucrose (Figure 4a), which could be rescued by in trans expression of corresponding arn
EC1 genes in the mutants (Figure S2). In contrast, deletion of arnD
EC1 did not seem to affect bacterial morphology (Figures 4a and S2). A bacterial mucoid phenotype is often associated with the overproduction of capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) and biofilm formation in bacteria (Mann & Wozniak, 2012). Consistent with their potential roles in LPS modification and CPS production, we showed that the arn

EC1 genes abolished the biofilm formation of D. oryzae EC1 (Figure 4b). Conversely, expression of the corresponding gene in trans could restore biofilm formation (Figure 4b).

EC1 was compared to that in the wild‐type strain EC1 by reverse transcription‐quantitative PCR (RT‐qPCR) analysis. The results showed that compared to the wild‐type strain EC1, cps1 expression was increased 15‐ to 48‐fold in these four mutants (Figure 7b). In‐frame deletion of cps1 in the backgrounds of single mutants in the arnBCA
EC1 genes led to conversion from a mucoid to a nonmucoid phenotype (Figures 4a and S2). These findings indicate that ArnEC1 proteins maintain the nonmucoid morphotype of D. oryzae EC1 through repression of CPS production.

EC1 (Table S5). KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the ribosome pathway was significantly affected in mutant ∆arnB
EC1 (p

Previous studies with E. coli and Bacillus subtilis unveiled that the genes in the S10 ribosomal protein gene cluster, that is, L2, L3, L17, and S11, are essential for bacterial growth, cell division, and swimming motility (Klitgaard et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2014; Takada et al., 2014; Zouine et al., 2000), which are the phenotypes modulated by ArnBEC1 in D. oryzae EC1.

EC1 (Figure 7e), mutant ∆arnB
EC1 had a lower amount of RNA than the wild‐type strain EC1 and mutant ∆arnD

DISCUSSION DISCUSSION Zeamines are phytotoxins produced by the phytopathogen D. oryzae that play vital roles as key virulence determinants in bacterial pathogenesis (Cheng et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2011). In addition, these polyamine compounds are also potent antibiotics against fungi, nematodes, and a range of bacterial pathogens (Hellberg et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2015; Masschelein, Clauwers, Awodi et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2010). The zeamine producer D. oryzae presents a remarkable higher level of zeamine resistance than a range of bacterial pathogens (Liang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2010). Obviously, such a superior self‐protection mechanism would be of critical importance for the bacterium to become a formidable pathogen and habitat dominator, as it allows the bacteria to produce sufficient phytotoxins/antibiotics to compete against the host and other microorganisms. In this study, we documented a new zeamine resistance mechanism encoded by the arn
EC1 operon that confers on D. oryzae an ability to protect itself against the toxicity of zeamines. Inactivation of the arn
EC1 operon genes drastically decreased D. oryzae EC1 resistance to zeamines (Table 1). In addition, significantly, we found that the arn
EC1 genes also play roles in modulation of CPS production (Figures 4a and S2), cell division (Figure 6), and bacterial growth (Figure 5a), thus influencing certain virulence‐related traits, including motility (Figure 5b), biofilm formation (Figure 4b), and pathogenesis (Figure 3). This study thus deciphers a new zeamine resistance mechanism and expands our understanding on the biological roles and significance of the ArnEC1 system in microbial pathogens. Zeamines are phytotoxins produced by the phytopathogen D. oryzae that play vital roles as key virulence determinants in bacterial pathogenesis (Cheng et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2011).

This study thus deciphers a new zeamine resistance mechanism and expands our understanding on the biological roles and significance of the ArnEC1 system in microbial pathogens. The arn operon is known for its role in bacterial resistance against CAMPs such as polymyxin B (Gunn et al., 2000; Jiang et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2014; McPhee et al., 2003; Winfield et al., 2005). The operon contains seven genes encoding the enzymes for modification of bacterial outer membrane LPS with the cationic l‐Ara4N moiety, which reduces the net negative charge of LPS and limits the binding, accumulation, and permeation of CAMPs (Yan et al., 2007). Among these seven genes, arnA encodes a decarboxylase/UDP‐4‐amino‐4‐deoxy‐l‐arabinose formyltransferase catalysing the first reaction step for the biosynthesis of UDP‐4‐ketopentose from UDP‐glucuronic acid. A UDP‐4‐amino‐4‐deoxy‐l‐arabinose‐oxoglutarate aminotransferase encoded by arnB converts UDP‐4‐ketopentose to UDP‐β‐l‐Ara4N at the second reaction step. At the third reaction step, an undecaprenyl phosphate‐4‐deoxy‐4‐formamido‐l‐arabinose transferase encoded by arnC transfers 4‐deoxy‐4‐formamido‐l‐arabinose from UDP to undecaprenyl phosphate for ArnD deformylation to form undecaprenyl phosphate‐α‐l‐Ara4N. The undecaprenyl phosphate‐α‐l‐Ara4N may be transported from the inner membrane to the outer membrane by two l‐Ara4N‐phosphoundecaprenol flippase subunits, ArnE and ArnF. At the last step, an undecaprenyl phosphate‐α‐4‐amino‐4‐deoxy‐l‐arabinose arabinosyl transferase encoded by arnT transfers l‐Ara4N from undecaprenyl phosphate‐α‐l‐Ara4N to lipid A (Breazeale et al., 2005; Trent et al., 2001; Yan et al., 2007). Bioinformatics analysis showed that the ArnEC1 enzymes are highly similar to the well‐characterized Arn homologues in S. enterica, P. aeruginosa, and D. dadantii with an amino acid similarity of over 57% (Table 1) and proposed conserved functions. MIC assay results unveiled the involvement of arn
EC1 genes in Dickeya tolerance against zeamines and polymyxin B (Table 1). Similar to polymyxin B, zeamines also contain positive charged amino groups and act by damaging the cell envelope of gram‐negative bacteria (Masschelein, Clauwers, Stalmans, et al., 2015), implying that addition of the l‐Ara4N moiety in LPS by the ArnEC1 system could reduce the chance of zeamines damaging the bacterial cell membrane. In addition, we found that the ArnEC1 system plays an essential role in D. oryzae biofilm formation, which is a well‐established antimicrobial and stress tolerance mechanism (Flemming et al., 2016). A previous study showed that inactivation of an arnA
EC1 homologue, pmrI, led to partially decreased biofilm formation in P. mirabilis (Jiang et al., 2010). In the present study, we found that biofilm formation in the arn
EC1 deletion mutants of D. oryzae was almost completely abolished (Figure 4b). Previous studies underlined the positive contributions of LPS to two key steps of biofilm formation, namely, bacterial initial attachment and adhesion to the abiotic surface (Ruhal & Kataria, 2021), and a general negative impact of CPS overproduction on biofilm formation (Limoli et al., 2015). As inactivation of the cps1 gene did not restore biofilm formation in arn
EC1 mutants, we proposed the complete abolishment of biofilm formation resulted from the negative impact of LPS changes after inactivation of arn
EC1 genes, but not a general negative influence of CPS overproduction caused by inactivation of arn
EC1 genes. Taken together, we conclude that the ArnEC1 system confers zeamine and CAMP resistance through modification of LPS and facilitation of biofilm formation in D. oryzae EC1. The arn operon is known for its role in bacterial resistance against CAMPs such as polymyxin B (Gunn et al., 2000; Jiang et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2014; McPhee et al., 2003; Winfield et al., 2005).

EC1 genes, but not a general negative influence of CPS overproduction caused by inactivation of arn
EC1 genes. Taken together, we conclude that the ArnEC1 system confers zeamine and CAMP resistance through modification of LPS and facilitation of biofilm formation in D. oryzae EC1. We recently reported that the RND efflux pump DesABC is involved in zeamine resistance (Liang et al., 2019). Interestingly, null mutation of the DesABC pump in D. oryzae EC1 causes an about eightfold decrease in zeamine resistance (Liang et al., 2019). In addition, transcriptional expression of desAB is inducible and triggered by exogenous addition of zeamines but not polymyxin B (Liang et al., 2019). In contrast, however, transcriptional expression of the arn
EC1 genes appeared to be cell density‐dependent and was not affected by zeamines (Figure 2a–c), and deletion of arn
EC1 genes caused a more severe loss of resistance to polymyxin B than to zeamines (Table 1). These findings suggest that DesABC is a zeamine‐specific resistance mechanism, whereas ArnEC1 is more likely a broad‐spectrum resistance mechanism against various CAMPs produced by the hosts and the competitors of D. oryzae in the environment. Such high expression of the ArnEC1 system at the early bacterial growth stage may facilitate D. oryzae survival upon exposure to CAMPs from the hosts and in the presence of competitors of D. oryzae when zeamines are not highly produced and accumulated for competition in the environment. Importantly, we found that simultaneous knockdown of arnB
EC1 and desB decreased the zeamine resistance of D. oryzae EC1 to a level similar to that of the zeamine‐sensitive E. coli DH5α (Table 1), indicating that the DesABC efflux pump and the ArnEC1 LPS modification system are the predominant self‐protection mechanisms of D. oryzae against its self‐produced toxic zeamines. We recently reported that the RND efflux pump DesABC is involved in zeamine resistance (Liang et al., 2019). Interestingly, null mutation of the DesABC pump in D. oryzae EC1 causes an about eightfold decrease in zeamine resistance (Liang et al., 2019).

Importantly, we found that simultaneous knockdown of arnB

In addition to validation of the role of the ArnEC1 LPS system in CAMP resistance and biofilm formation (Figure 4b, Table 1), which have been documented in other bacterial species as well (Gunn et al., 2000; Jiang et al., 2010), interestingly, the results from this study unveiled several new biological functions associated with the ArnEC1 system or its components. Transcriptomics analysis performed between the wild‐type strain EC1 and the arnB
EC1 mutant not only suggested the bacterial growth and virulence conferred by ArnBEC1 are associated with the contribution of ArnBEC1 to the regulation of the expression of hundreds of genes in D. oryzae, especially those belonging to ribosome, carbon metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, but also unveiled the similarities and dissimilarities of ArnEC1 components in regulating biological functions. Firstly, ArnBCATEC1 have similar roles in conferring a nonmucoid phenotype through repressing CPS genes. Transcriptomics analysis results unveiled that inactivation of arnB
EC1 resulted in overexpression of CPS genes (Table S4), which subsequently led to the finding that ArnCATEC1 also influenced the conversion between mucoid and nonmucoid phenotypes through modulation of CPS gene expression (Figures 4a, 7b, and S2). Notably, ArnDEC1 plays a dissimilar role in conferring the bacterial nonmucoid morphotype. Inactivation of arnD
EC1 up‐regulated CPS gene expression (Figure 7b), but this did not result in a mucoid phenotype as inactivation of the arnBCAT
EC1 genes (Figure 4). We proposed that in addition to a similar role in the regulation of CPS gene expression, ArnDEC1 may play additional roles in modulating metabolic pathways required for the biosynthesis of CPS components. This was evident as ArnDEC1 had a higher contribution to bacterial growth than other ArnEC1 components (Figure 5a). Such multifaceted impact of ArnDEC1 on bacterial metabolism may lead to the difference between ArnDEC1 and other ArnEC1 components in regulating the conversion between mucoid and nonmucoid phenotypes. Secondly, it is intriguing to find that although ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have regulatory roles in bacterial growth and swimming motility, ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have distinct regulatory mechanisms. Transcriptomics analysis results unveiled that ArnBEC1 induces the expression of S10 ribosomal genes, whose counterparts in E. coli and B. subtilis are involved in bacterial growth, cell division, and swimming motility (Klitgaard et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2014; Takada et al., 2014; Zouine et al., 2000). However, unlike ArnBEC1, ArnDEC1 did not play a significant role in inducing the expression of S10 ribosomal genes and a process associated with ribosomal protein production, that is, RNA biosynthesis (Figure 7d,e). We proposed these observations may result from the fact that ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have different substrate specificity, as ArnBEC1 is a proposed putative UDP‐4‐amino‐4‐deoxy‐l‐arabinose‐oxoglutarate aminotransferase, whereas ArnDEC1 is a proposed 4‐deoxy‐4‐formamido‐l‐arabinose‐phosphoundecaprenol deformylase. Although the mechanisms of action of ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 are still unclear, studies of the biological functions of arnB
EC1 and arnD
EC1 mutants provided useful clues on how ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 affect the virulence of D. oryzae. The present study demonstrated the roles of ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 in the regulation of swimming motility and bacterial growth (Figure 5). Bacterial motility is one of the key virulence determinants of D. oryzae that plays important roles in bacterial invasion and systemic infection (Chen et al., 2020, 2022; Hussain et al., 2008; Lv et al., 2018, 2022; Shi et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2016). It seems rational that the larger contributions of ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 than other ArnEC1 components to D. oryzae virulence resulted from the positive regulation of swimming motility by ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1. Given that ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have different regulatory roles in cell division, expression of S10 ribosomal genes, and RNA synthesis (Figures 6 and 7d,e), we proposed the contributions of ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 to D. oryzae virulence are redundant. In addition to validation of the role of the ArnEC1 LPS system in CAMP resistance and biofilm formation (Figure 4b, Table 1), which have been documented in other bacterial species as well (Gunn et al., 2000; Jiang et al., 2010), interestingly, the results from this study unveiled several new biological functions associated with the ArnEC1 system or its components. Transcriptomics analysis performed between the wild‐type strain EC1 and the arnB
EC1 mutant not only suggested the bacterial growth and virulence conferred by ArnBEC1 are associated with the contribution of ArnBEC1 to the regulation of the expression of hundreds of genes in D. oryzae, especially those belonging to ribosome, carbon metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, but also unveiled the similarities and dissimilarities of ArnEC1 components in regulating biological functions. Firstly, ArnBCATEC1 have similar roles in conferring a nonmucoid phenotype through repressing CPS genes. Transcriptomics analysis results unveiled that inactivation of arnB
EC1 resulted in overexpression of CPS genes (Table S4), which subsequently led to the finding that ArnCATEC1 also influenced the conversion between mucoid and nonmucoid phenotypes through modulation of CPS gene expression (Figures 4a, 7b, and S2). Notably, ArnDEC1 plays a dissimilar role in conferring the bacterial nonmucoid morphotype. Inactivation of arnD
EC1 up‐regulated CPS gene expression (Figure 7b), but this did not result in a mucoid phenotype as inactivation of the arnBCAT
EC1 genes (Figure 4). We proposed that in addition to a similar role in the regulation of CPS gene expression, ArnDEC1 may play additional roles in modulating metabolic pathways required for the biosynthesis of CPS components. This was evident as ArnDEC1 had a higher contribution to bacterial growth than other ArnEC1 components (Figure 5a). Such multifaceted impact of ArnDEC1 on bacterial metabolism may lead to the difference between ArnDEC1 and other ArnEC1 components in regulating the conversion between mucoid and nonmucoid phenotypes. Secondly, it is intriguing to find that although ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have regulatory roles in bacterial growth and swimming motility, ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have distinct regulatory mechanisms. Transcriptomics analysis results unveiled that ArnBEC1 induces the expression of S10 ribosomal genes, whose counterparts in E. coli and B. subtilis are involved in bacterial growth, cell division, and swimming motility (Klitgaard et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2014; Takada et al., 2014; Zouine et al., 2000). However, unlike ArnBEC1, ArnDEC1 did not play a significant role in inducing the expression of S10 ribosomal genes and a process associated with ribosomal protein production, that is, RNA biosynthesis (Figure 7d,e). We proposed these observations may result from the fact that ArnBEC1 and ArnDEC1 have different substrate specificity, as ArnBEC1 is a proposed putative UDP‐4‐amino‐4‐deoxy‐l‐arabinose‐oxoglutarate aminotransferase, whereas ArnDEC1 is a proposed 4‐deoxy‐4‐formamido‐l‐arabinose‐phosphoundecaprenol deformylase.

In summary, this study unveils a new zeamine resistance mechanism mediated by the ArnEC1 LPS modification system in D. oryzae EC1; this mechanism and the previously identified DesABC efflux pump constitute the foremost resistance mechanisms against zeamines. These findings improve our understanding of how D. oryzae could safeguard itself while producing formidable toxic molecules to infect host organisms and attack its potential competitors and may facilitate engineering of D. oryzae strains able to overproduce this family of potent antimicrobial compounds. In addition, importantly, characterization of the ArnEC1 system led to the discovery of new roles of the ArnEC1 system and its components in bacterial physiology and virulence, which provide not only valuable insight into the biological functions of the widely conserved Arn system, but also useful clues for further elucidating the complicated and sophisticated regulatory mechanisms that govern bacterial physiology and virulence.

Transposon mutagenesis analysis Transposon mutagenesis analysis Transposon mutagenesis analysis To identify the genes that are involved in zeamine resistance in D. oryzae EC1, the mutant ∆zmsA was randomly mutated with the mariner‐based transposon carried by pBT20 (Seet & Zhang, 2011) through biparental mating on YEB agar plates (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L KCl, 10 g/L sucrose, 0.5 g/L MgSO4⸱7H2O, 18 g/L agar, pH 7.0). Zeamine sensitivity of each mutant was monitored by determining its growth in LB medium containing zeamines at half the MIC of zeamines for the mutant ∆zmsA (900 μg/mL) in 96‐well plates. The mutants showing no visible growth after overnight culturing in LB medium with zeamines were considered as the desired mutants.

Fifteen individual cells from three different microscopic views were randomly selected for measurement of bacterial cell length using ZEN 2 (blue edition) v. 2.0 software. For transmission electron microscopy analysis, a copper grid was floated on a drop of bacterial cell culture for 1 min. After the adsorption process, the copper grid was rinsed three times with double‐distilled water and then stained with TI blue (Nisshin EM Co., Ltd) for 1 min. Samples were imaged by Talos L120C (Thermo Fisher) and at least three representative cells of each sample were photographed.

RNA extraction, transcriptomics, RT‐PCR, and RT‐qPCR RNA extraction, transcriptomics, RT‐PCR, and RT‐qPCR RNA extraction, transcriptomics, RT‐PCR, and RT‐qPCR Total RNA of bacterial cells was extracted with the SV Total RNA Isolated System kit (Promega). RNA density was measured by a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and RNA integrity was analysed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies). For transcriptomics analysis, the libraries were prepared using the TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3‐cBot‐HS (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced using an Illumina Novaseq platform. Two biological replicates were applied in this assay. Data were aligned by Bowtie v. 2‐2.2.3. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq R package (v. 1.18.0), and genes with log2[fold change] ≥ |1| and adjusted p value ≤ 0.05 (p
adj ≤ 0.05) were considered as differentially expressed. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed by testing the statistical enrichment of differentially expressed genes using KOBAS software. For RT‐PCR analysis, the intergenic regions of arnBC
