The effects of rare earth mining on rice biomass, rare earth element (REE) content and bacterial community structure was studied through pot experiment. The research shows that the REE content in rice roots, shoots and grains was significantly positive correlated with that in soil, and the dry weight of rice roots, shoots and grains was highly correlated with soil physical and chemical properties, nutrient elements and REE contents; The exploitation of rare earth minerals inhibited a-diversity of endophytic bacteria in rhizosphere, root, phyllosphere and leaf of rice, significantly reduced the abundance index, OTU number, Chao, Ace index and also significantly reduced the diversity index–Shannon index, and also reduced uniformity index: Pielou’s evenness index, which caused β-diversity of bacteria to be quite different. The exploitation of rare earth minerals reduces the diversity of bacteria, but forms dominant bacteria, such as Burkholderia, Bacillus, Buttiauxella, Acinetobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Candida koribacter, which can degrade the pollutants formed by exploitation of rare earth minerals, alleviate the compound pollution of rare earth and ammonia nitrogen, and also has the function of fixing nitrogen and resisting rare earth stress; The content of soil available phosphorus in no-mining area is lower, and the dominant bacteria of Pantoea formed in such soil, which has the function of improving soil phosphorus availability. Rare earth elements and physical and chemical properties of soil affect the community structure of bacteria in rhizosphere and phyllosphere of rice, promote the parallel movement of some bacteria in rhizosphere, root, phyllosphere and leaf of rice, promote the construction of community structure of bacteria in rhizosphere and phyllosphere of rice, give full play to the growth promoting function of Endophytes, and promote the growth of rice. The results showed that the exploitation of rare earth minerals has formed the dominant endophytic bacteria of rice and ensured the yield of rice in the mining area, however, the mining of mineral resources causes the compound pollution of rare earth and ammonia nitrogen, which makes REE content of rice in mining area significantly higher than that in non-mining area, and the excessive rare earth element may enter the human body through the food chain and affect human health, so the food security in the REE mining area deserves more attention. Subject terms Introduction Introduction China is a major producer, exporter and consumer of rare earth resources in the world. It was reported that China owns about 50 percent of the world's rare earth resources and provides about 90 percent of the global supply of rare earth1. South China, with Ganzhou City of Jiangxi Province as the center, is an important distribution area of ion-type rare earth resources in the world, and its reserves account for about 70% of the world's total reserves2. The illegal and disorderly exploitation of rare earth resources caused large amount of rare earth elements to enter the soil and water environment, which affects the growth of plants, animals and microorganisms in the environment, thus changes the ecological environment and affects human health through the food chain3,4. Rice is the main grain of south China, and the yield and quality of rice are closely related to the ecological environment of cultivated land. Microorganism is the most sensitive indicator of farmland ecological environment. The microorganism is affected by soil physical and chemical properties, plant species/genotypes, and also affected by heavy metal pollution5,6.

Microorganism is the most sensitive indicator of farmland ecological environment. The microorganism is affected by soil physical and chemical properties, plant species/genotypes, and also affected by heavy metal pollution5,6. With the extensive use of rare earth resources in many industries, the world's demand for rare earth resources increased from 136,000 tons in 2017 to 151,000 tons in 20207. The impact of rare earth mining and smelting on the environment has attracted much attention. It is reported that the REE content in soil of rare earth mining area in South China is 396–2314 mg/kg8, which is much higher than the average REE content in soil of China. The concentration of rare earth in water is 1000 times9 higher than that in ordinary fresh water. Rare earth elements in ecosystems not only affect plants and animals, but also affect the growth, reproduction, migration and colonization of microorganisms10,11. Rare earth elements affect the growth indexes of plants, including the biomass of above-ground and underground parts. It affects the index of plant resistance system, such as plant enzyme activity, etc. It also affect the REE content in plants12,13. The appropriate concentration of rare earth elements can promote the growth and reproduction of microorganism and the increase of metabolites, while high concentration of rare earth can inhibit growth and reproduction of microorganism14. Chu et al.15 found that La3+ has strong toxic effect on bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi and other microorganisms in the microflora of red soil. He et al.16 found that rare earth elements had strong inhibitory effect on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Wang et al.17 found that the changes of soil REE content and physical and chemical properties significantly affected the diversity and abundance of soil bacteria. Wang18 found that the microbial biomass in the areas with serious accumulation of rare earth was inhibited, the bacterial diversity in the non-rare earth mining area was higher than that in the mining area. The REE content is the main factor affecting the microbial structure. Rare earth elements are very important for methoxybacteria in extremely acidic environment19–21.

The REE content is the main factor affecting the microbial structure. Rare earth elements are very important for methoxybacteria in extremely acidic environment19–21. After rare earth elements enter the soil, they directly affect the microorganisms in the soil–plant ecosystem, and also indirectly affect the microorganisms by influencing the physical and chemical properties of soil and plant bio-chemical system. Microorganisms carry out the processes of oxidation, nitrification, ammoniation, nitrogen fixation and vulcanization in soil to promote the decomposition of soil organic matter and the transformation of nutrients. Endophytes have significant effects on plants, e.g. endophytic bacteria has nitrogen fixation effect on rice. The common endophytic azotobacters are Pseudomonas, Spirulina, Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus, they reduce the free N2 in the atmosphere into the available NH4+ by nitrogenase22,23. The endogenous bacteria can secrete indoleacetic acid, which promote the cell division and root growth of plants, assist host rice to improve the absorption efficiency of N, P and K, improve the production of gibberellin and salicylic acid in rice, thus promote the growth of rice24–26. Endophytic bacteria can help to resist sheath blight, and the mechanism of rice endophytes assisting host rice disease resistance mainly includes secretion of antibiotics, hyperparasitism, niche competition and induction of rice self-resistance27,28. To resist abiotic stress, endophytic bacteria can help plants polluted by heavy metals obtain bioremediation, e.g. Zhou et al.29 found that endophytic bacteria Stenotrophomonas maltophilia R5-5 significantly reduced the Cd content in rice plants by down regulating the gene expression of cadmium absorption and transport proteins in rice and changing the community structure of endophytic bacteria, and endophytic bacteria can effectively protect plants from the toxicity of many heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn)30.

At present, the research on the effect of endophytes on rice is mainly carried out in uncontaminated habitats, but the research carried out in rare earth polluted habitats has not been reported. In this study, the soil of typical REE mining area in Ganzhou City of Jiangxi Province was taken as the research object, and the soil of non-mining area was taken as the control check (CK). The effects of rare earth elements on bacteria in rhizosphere, root, phyllosphere and leaf of soil–rice ecosystem were discussed, which has scientific value and practical significance.

Discussion Discussion Previous studies have shown that lower concentrations of rare earth can promote the growth of crops, while higher concentrations can inhibit or even harm the growth of crops12,13,31. In this study, the shoots of rice tillers cultivated in soil of H and M in rare earth mining area were significantly more than those in non-mining area, especially rice cultivated in soil of M with medium rare earth content grew best. The dry weight of rice root, shoot and grain of soil H and M was significantly heavier than that of soil L. M was the heaviest, followed by H and L. The results are basically consistent with previous studies3–5. Due to extraction of ionic rare earth by (NH4)2SO4 leaching, ammonia N in mining area seriously exceeded the standard, pH value decreased, which caused dry weight of root, shoot, grain of cultivated rice in mining area to have significant negative correlation with nitrate nitrogen, and negative correlation with total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and significant positive correlation with pH. A large number of studies have shown that there is a significant positive correlation between the REE content in crops and that in soil2–5. In this study, the content gradient of rare earth elements in soil is H > M > L, and the content gradient of rare earth elements in rice root, shoot and grain is H > M > L, which is basically consistent with the previous research results3–5. Previous studies have shown that lower concentrations of rare earth can promote the growth of crops, while higher concentrations can inhibit or even harm the growth of crops12,13,31. In this study, the shoots of rice tillers cultivated in soil of H and M in rare earth mining area were significantly more than those in non-mining area, especially rice cultivated in soil of M with medium rare earth content grew best. The dry weight of rice root, shoot and grain of soil H and M was significantly heavier than that of soil L. M was the heaviest, followed by H and L. The results are basically consistent with previous studies3–5. Due to extraction of ionic rare earth by (NH4)2SO4 leaching, ammonia N in mining area seriously exceeded the standard, pH value decreased, which caused dry weight of root, shoot, grain of cultivated rice in mining area to have significant negative correlation with nitrate nitrogen, and negative correlation with total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and significant positive correlation with pH. A large number of studies have shown that there is a significant positive correlation between the REE content in crops and that in soil2–5. In this study, the content gradient of rare earth elements in soil is H > M > L, and the content gradient of rare earth elements in rice root, shoot and grain is H > M > L, which is basically consistent with the previous research results3–5. Chao et al.21 considered that the REE content is the main factor affecting the microbial structure in rare earth mining area. Jiang et al.32 and Zhou et al.33 thought that high concentration of rare earth elements had inhibitory effect on bacteria. Yang et al.34 showed that when the concentration of rare earth ions reached a certain value, it had antibacterial effect; Some studies have shown that exogenous rare earth element Yttrium destroyed the structure of soil microbial community and significantly reduced OTUs, Ace, Chao1 and Shannon index35. Chen et al.36 found that rare earth mining seriously damaged the soil quality of the mining area, caused low diversity and evenness of microbial community. In this study, the OTU number of rice bacteria in rhizosphere, root and phyllosphere cultured in soil H and M of rare earth mining area was lower than that in soil L of non-rare earth mining area at tillering stage and maturity stage. In addition, the number of OTUs of bacteria in leaf of rice cultured in soil M was significantly lower than that in soil L. The richness and Chao indexes of bacteria in rhizosphere, root and phyllosphere of rice cultured in soil H and M were significantly lower than those in soil L at tillering stage and maturity stage. The Shannon index of H and M was significantly lower than that of L. The Pielou's evenness index of H and M were lower than that of L. It shows that the exploitation of rare earth reduces α-diversity of rice bacteria, which is consistent with the previous research conclusions of many scholars19–21. Mineral exploitation affects the REE content in soil, soil physical and chemical properties and rice growth, caused β-diversity of bacteria to be quite different.

Mineral exploitation affects the REE content in soil, soil physical and chemical properties and rice growth, caused β-diversity of bacteria to be quite different. Many studies have shown that soil heavy metals, physical and chemical properties, nutrient elements are important factors affecting microbial community structure37–39. Wei40 found that rare earth pollution affected the abundance of bacteria and fungi and changed their community structure. Wang41 found that the contents of bacteria, fungi and Actinomycetes decreased significantly, and the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria changed significantly. However, the dominant species of soil bacteria was Firmicutes, which was related to Proteus, Actinomycetes, Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria. Firmicutes are affected by rare earth elements3,5,41. In this study, the abundance of Firmicutes in rice rhizosphere cultivated in soil H and M at tillering stage was significantly higher than that of soil L, and the abundance of Firmicutes in rice rhizosphere cultivated in soil H was significantly higher than that of soil M and L; The abundance of L was significantly higher than that of H and M; The abundance of Firmicutes in rice rhizosphere cultivated in soil L was significantly lower than that of soil H and M. It can be seen that Firmicutes (phylum) in soil–plant system are sensitive to rare earth elements, but the mechanism is very complex. Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria are greatly affected by soil physical and chemical properties. The former is directly proportional to pH value, while the latter is inversely proportional to pH value3,5. The pH value of rare earth mining area was reduced by mineral exploitation, and the abundance of Actinobacteria in rice rhizosphere of soil L was significantly higher than that in soil H and M, and the abundance of acidobacteria in rice rhizosphere of soil L was significantly lower than that in soil H and M.

The exploitation of rare earth minerals significantly reduced the diversity and evenness of soil–plant system microorganisms, and enhanced the resistance and growth of some bacteria, causing the formation of some dominant bacterial genera in rare earth mining area. For example, a large amount of acid mineral water was formed due to mineral exploitation, and the abundance of Candida solibacter and Candida koribacter in rice rhizosphere of soil M was higher42. Many dominant bacteria can promote the growth of rice, improve the yield of rice, and make the dry weight of rice root, shoots and grain be highly or extremely significantly negatively correlated to α-diversity of bacteria. Some scholars believe that the biological effect of rare earth ions may be similar to that of Ca ions because the radius of rare earth ions is close to that of Ca ions, rare earth ions may occupy or replace Ca ions in organisms43,44. Some researchers have explored the mechanism of the interaction between rare earth ions and microorganisms at the protein level. They believe that rare earth ions can affect the production of differential proteins by microorganisms, thus controlling the growth, reproduction and metabolism of microorganisms45,46. The differential proteins mainly include transporters, stress-related proteins, metabolism related proteins, etc. Chai et al.47 found that the effect of rare earth ions on promoting microbial reproduction was inhibited by chlorpromazine, indicating that the mechanism of La and Ce promoting bacterial growth may be related to calmodulin.

Soil environment, plants and microorganisms interact with each other, soil and plants affect bacteria, and bacteria also react on plants and soil48. Bacteria in soil–plant system can be divided into beneficial bacteria, neutral bacteria and harmful bacteria. Harmful bacteria endangers plant growth, and beneficial bacteria can play an important role in promoting plant growth, nutrient absorption and stress response49–52. Due to mineral exploitation, the REE content and ammonia nitrogen in soil increased significantly, the vegetation was destroyed, and the content of organic matter was low, which affected the ecological environment53. At tillering stage, Ralstonia abundance in root, rhizosphere, leaf of rice in soil H was high, accounting for 17.8%, 2.18% and 8.12% respectively. Ralstonia is a plant pathogenic bacteria, affecting the growth of rice54, which may be one of the reasons why the dry weight of root, shoot and grain of group H is lower than that of group M. The abundance of Herbaspirillum, Azospirillum and Bacillus in rice root, the abundance of Azospirillum in rice root and rhizosphere, The abundance of Bacillus in rice root, rhizosphere, leaf and phyllosphere of H is relatively high. Nitrogen fixation of Herbaspirillum and Azospirillum can promote plant growth, nutrient absorption and photosynthetic efficiency55–57. Bacillus has strong growth promoting effect on rice, potential antibacterial activity and strong antagonistic activity. It can produce iron carrier in iron limited medium and produce four kinds of secondary metabolites, causing damage to cell membrane of Magnaporthe grisea58,59. These beneficial bacteria may be an important reason why rice biomass in group H is significantly higher than that in group L.

These beneficial bacteria may be an important reason why rice biomass in group H is significantly higher than that in group L. Because of mineral exploitation, soil rare earth elements, total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in soil M were significantly higher than those in non-mining areas, pH decreased, soil acidity increased, forming a compound pollution of rare earth and ammonia nitrogen, causing bacterial species to be monotonous. At tillering stage, Burkholderia abundance in rice root and rhizosphere of M was very high, and Acinetobacter, Buttiauxella and Comamonas abundance in rice leaf was very high. Burkholderia is a microorganism with the ability to degrade ammonia nitrogen efficiently. It can transform ammonia nitrogen into substances needed by itself or beneficial to the environment. It has the functions of biological control, promoting plant growth, decomposing toxic substances and bioremediation. It is a potential genus for remediation of high ammonia nitrogen pollution in rare earth mine wasteland in South Jiangxi Province60. Acinetobacter can improve the resistance of plants to Cu, the ability to remove Ni and the ability to separate rare earth elements61–63. Buttiauxella could significantly improve the biomass and chlorophyll content of shoots and roots of plants treated with Cd64 and Comamonas also had the ability to degrade a variety of environmental pollutants65. These beneficial bacteria may be an important reason for the higher biomass of rice grew in soil M than that grew in soil H and L.

These beneficial bacteria may be an important reason for the higher biomass of rice grew in soil M than that grew in soil H and L. In the maturity stage, Burkholderia, Bradyrhizobium, Ideonella and Pleomorphomonas were found in rice rhizosphere of soil H. the abundance of Geobacter and Denitisoma was higher. The abundance of Bradyrhizobium in rice roots of soil M was especially high in maturity stage, and the abundance of Geobacter and Candida_koribacter in rice rhizosphere was high. Bradyrhizobium Rhizobium not only colonizes in legumes, but also in rice. The symbiosis between Bradyrhizobium Rhizobium and rice can achieve biological nitrogen fixation, which plays an important role in ensuring food security and ecological construction66. These bacteria may be another important reason why rice yield of soil H and M is significantly higher than that of soil L.

These bacteria may be another important reason why rice yield of soil H and M is significantly higher than that of soil L. The contents of available P and ammonia nitrogen in L soil were significantly lower, and the relative abundances of Pantoea and Acidovorax in rice roots were higher at tillering stage. Acidovorax is the pathogen of brown streaked disease of rice67, which may be one of the reasons why rice yield cultivated in soil L is lower than that cultivated in soil H and M. Pantoea can promote the growth of alfalfa, promote the growth of wheat root and shoot, improve the availability of phosphorus in soil, and reduce the application of fertilizer68. The relative abundance of Exiguobacterium in rice phyllosphere of soil L is high. Some studies have shown that it has broad-spectrum antibacterial effect on Gram-positive and gram-negative food-borne pathogenic bacteria. It has antagonistic effect on a variety of plant pathogenic bacteria. It shows the ability of nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization and iron carrier generation69,70. The relative abundance of Weissella in leaves is high, which is beneficial bacteria71. The relative abundances of Bradyrhizobium, Ideonella, Methylocystis, Streptomyces and Georgfuchsia were higher in rice roots at maturity stage. Methylocystis can inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus albicans and Bacillus subtilis with spores, produce single cell protein, and have an important impact on the global C cycle72. Streptomyces has the potential of biocontrol against plant pathogenic bacteria73. Georgfuchsia is an aromatic compound degrading bacterium in aquifers74. These beneficial bacteria may be an important reason for the healthy growth of L rice under the condition of low soil fertility.

These beneficial bacteria may be an important reason for the healthy growth of L rice under the condition of low soil fertility. At tillering stage, Ralstonia was relatively abundant in rice root of soil H and moved vertically to rice leaf, resulting in higher relative abundance of Ralstonia in rice leaf; The relative abundance of Ideonella and Bacillus in rice rhizosphere was high, and moved horizontally to the root and leaf of rice, causing higher relative abundance in root and leaf; The relative abundance of Burkholderia and Buttiauxella in the rice rhizosphere of soil M was high, and moved horizontally to the root and leaf of rice, resulting in higher relative abundance of Burkholderia and Buttiauxella in the root and leaf; The relative abundance of Exiguobacterium in rice phyllosphere of soil L was high, and it moved horizontally into rice leaf, so that the relative abundance of Exiguobacterium in the rice leaf was also high. The relative abundance of Azospira, Anaeromyces Obacter and Georgfuchsia in the rice rhizosphere of soil H was higher in the maturity stage, and moved horizontally to the root, which made the relative abundance of Azospira higher in the root. The horizontal movement of these bacteria makes them play an active role in the process of rice growth and become an important reason for the healthy growth of rice75.
