Although some fungi may potentially overcome the barrier presented by antimicrobial compounds, only a limited number of examples and molecular mechanisms of resistance have been reported. Here, we found an Aglaia plant-parasitizing fungus that overcomes the toxicity of rocaglates, which are translation inhibitors synthesized by the plant, through an amino acid substitution in a eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF). De novo transcriptome assembly revealed that the fungus belongs to the Ophiocordyceps genus and that its eIF4A, a molecular target of rocaglates, harbors an amino acid substitution critical for rocaglate binding. Ribosome profiling harnessing a cucumber-infecting fungus, Colletotrichum orbiculare, demonstrated that the translational inhibitory effects of rocaglates were largely attenuated by the mutation found in the Aglaia parasite. The engineered C. orbiculare showed a survival advantage on cucumber plants with rocaglates. Our study exemplifies a plant–fungus tug-of-war centered on secondary metabolites produced by host plants. eLife digest Although plants may seem like passive creatures, they are in fact engaged in a constant battle against the parasitic fungi that attack them. To combat these fungal foes, plants produce small molecules that act like chemical weapons and kill the parasite. However, the fungi sometimes fight back, often by developing enzymes that can break down the deadly chemicals into harmless products. One class of anti-fungal molecules that has drawn great interest is rocaglates, as they show promise as treatments for cancer and COVID-19. Rocaglates are produced by plants in the Aglaia family and work by targeting the fungal molecule eIF4A which is fundamental for synthesizing proteins. Since proteins perform most of the chemistry necessary for life, one might think that rocaglates could ward off any fungus. But Chen et al. discovered there is in fact a species of fungi that can evade this powerful defense mechanism. After seeing this new-found fungal species successfully growing on Aglaia plants, Chen et al. set out to find how it is able to protect itself from rocoglates. Genetic analysis of the fungus revealed that its eIF4A contained a single mutation that ‘blocked’ rocaglates from interacting with it. Chen et al. confirmed this effect by engineering a second fungal species (which infects cucumber plants) so that its elF4A protein contained the mutation found in the new fungus. Fungi with the mutated eIF4A thrived on cucumber leaves treated with a chemical derived from rocaglates, whereas fungi with the non-mutated version were less successful. These results shed new light on the constant ‘arms race’ between plants and their fungal parasites, with each side evolving more sophisticated ways to overcome the other’s defenses. Chen et al. hope that identifying the new rocaglate-resistant eIF4A mutation will help guide the development and use of any therapies based on rocaglates. Further work investigating how often the mutation occurs in humans will also be important for determining how effective these therapies will be. Research organism Introduction Introduction Fungi that infect plants are of great economic relevance because they cause severe crop losses (~10%) worldwide (Oerke, 2006). Therefore, the mechanisms underlying plant–fungus interactions have attracted great interest and have been extensively studied (Lo Presti et al., 2015). Secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activities are among the means naturally developed by plants for the control of fungal infections (Collemare et al., 2019). For example, tomatine, a glycoalkaloid secreted from the leaves and stems of tomato, has both fungicidal properties and insecticidal activities (Vance et al., 1987). Camalexin, an indole alkaloid produced by Brassicaceae plants, including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, also has antifungal properties (Nafisi et al., 2007).

However, some fungi can overcome these toxic compounds to infect plants. The best-known strategy is the detoxification of antifungal compounds by the secretion of specific enzymes (Crombie et al., 1986; Osbourn et al., 1995; Pareja-Jaime et al., 2008). Thus, plants and infectious fungi are engaged in an arms race during the course of evolution. However, other than detoxification, the mechanistic diversity of the plant–fungus competition centered on plant secondary metabolites is largely unknown.

Thus, plants and infectious fungi are engaged in an arms race during the course of evolution. However, other than detoxification, the mechanistic diversity of the plant–fungus competition centered on plant secondary metabolites is largely unknown. Rocaglates, small molecules synthesized in plants of the genus Aglaia, exemplify antifungal secondary metabolites (Engelmeier et al., 2000; Iyer et al., 2020). In addition to its antifungal properties, this group of compounds is of particular interest because of its antitumor activities (Alachkar et al., 2013; Bordeleau et al., 2008; Cencic et al., 2009; Chan et al., 2019; Ernst et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2009; Manier et al., 2017; Nishida et al., 2021; Santagata et al., 2013; Skofler et al., 2021; Thompson et al., 2021; Thompson et al., 2017; Wilmore et al., 2021; Wolfe et al., 2014). Moreover, recent studies have suggested potency against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (Müller et al., 2021; Müller et al., 2020) and hepatitis E virus (Praditya et al., 2022). Rocaglates target translation initiation factor (eIF) 4A, a DEAD-box RNA binding protein, and function as potent translation inhibitors with a unique mechanism: rocaglate treatment does not phenocopy the loss of function of eIF4A but instead leads to gain of function. Although eIF4A activates the translation of cellular mRNA through ATP-dependent RNA binding, rocaglates impose polypurine (A and G repeated) sequence selectivity on eIF4A, bypassing the ATP requirements and evoking mRNA-selective translational repression (Chen et al., 2021; Chu et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2016; Rubio et al., 2014; Wolfe et al., 2014). The artificial anchoring of eIF4A (1) becomes a steric hindrance to scanning 40S ribosomes (Iwasaki et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2016), (2) masks cap structure of mRNA by tethering eIF4F (Chu et al., 2020), and (3) reduces the available pool of eIF4A for active translation initiation events by the sequestration of eIF4A on mRNAs (Chu et al., 2020).

Since eIF4A is an essential gene for all eukaryotes, Aglaia plants must have a mechanism to evade the cytotoxicity of the rocaglates they produce. This self-resistance is achieved by the unique amino acid substitutions at the sites in eIF4A proteins where rocaglates directly associate (Iwasaki et al., 2019). Given the high evolutionary conservation of eIF4A and thus its rocaglate binding pocket (Iwasaki et al., 2019), these compounds may target a wide array of natural fungi.

Irrespective of the antifungal nature of rocaglates, we found a parasitic fungus able to grow on Aglaia plants. De novo transcriptome analysis from the fungus revealed that this species belongs to the Ophiocordyceps genus, whose members infect ants and cause a 'zombie' phenotype (Andersen et al., 2009; Araújo and Hughes, 2019; de Bekker et al., 2017), but constitutes a distinct branch in the taxon. Strikingly, eIF4A from this fungus possessed an amino acid substitution in the rocaglate binding site and thus showed resistance to the compound. Using Colletotrichum orbiculare, a cucumber-infecting fungus, as a model, we demonstrated that the genetically engineered fungus with the substitution showed insensitivity to the translational repression induced by rocaglates, facilitating its infection of plants even in the presence of this compound. Our results indicate fungal resistance to plant secondary metabolites independent of detoxification enzymes and a unique contest between plants and fungi centered on secondary metabolites synthesized in the host plant.

This Aglaia-infecting fungus belonged to the Ophiocordyceps genus, which is known as zombie-ant fungus (Andersen et al., 2009; Araújo and Hughes, 2019; de Bekker et al., 2017). Ophiocordyceps spp. are members of the phylum Ascomycota and constitute the taxonomic groups with the highest number of entomopathogenic species among all fungal genera. In most cases, each Ophiocordyceps spp. has a specific host insect species, develops fruiting bodies from the remains of host insects, and produces spores. In addition to insect infection, a moth parasite, Ophiocordyceps sinensis, has been found to reside on many plant species, suggesting that Ophiocordyceps also has an endophytic lifestyle (Wang et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2014). We performed a BLASTn search (Camacho et al., 2009) using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) between rRNAs as a query and found that, among all the deposited nucleotide sequences in the database, 29 of the top 30 hits were from Ophiocordyceps species (Supplementary file 2).

To identify the species-level taxon of the Aglaia-infecting fungus, we conducted a multilocus phylogenetic analysis for comparison with currently accepted species in the Ophiocordyceps genus (Supplementary file 3). For this purpose, sequences of the ITS, small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU), large subunit rRNA (LSU), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1α), and RNA polymerase II largest subunit (RPB1) were used as previously reported for the classification of Ophiocordyceps species (Xiao et al., 2017; Supplementary file 3). These sequences from 68 isolates were aligned, trimmed, and concatenated, resulting in a multiple sequence alignment comprising 3910 nucleotide positions, including gaps (gene boundaries ITS, 1–463; LSU, 464–1363; SSU, 1364–2248; RPB1, 2249–2922; TEF1α, 2923–3910). Then, the best-scoring maximum likelihood (ML) tree was generated from the concatenated sequence alignment using the selected DNA substitution models for each sequence (Figure 1B). This analysis indicated that the Aglaia-infecting fungus was distinct from the other species of Ophiocordyceps (Figure 1B). In particular, the strain isolated from Aglaia was positioned on a long branch separated from the most closely related strain, O. coccidiicola NBRC 100682, as supported by the 95% bootstrap value. The separation of Aglaia-infecting fungus from other Ophiocordyceps species was also confirmed by single-locus alignments (Figure 1—figure supplements 1–5), although the positions of the Aglaia-infecting fungus in the tree were different. We note that RPB1-locus alignment was an exception since the de novo-assembled transcriptome from the Aglaia-infecting fungus lacked the sequence of the homolog.

We note that RPB1-locus alignment was an exception since the de novo-assembled transcriptome from the Aglaia-infecting fungus lacked the sequence of the homolog. Given that the most closely related Ophiocordyceps species is sufficiently distinct from the Aglaia-infecting fungus in sequence and that no similar fungi grown in Aglaia plants were reported before, we named the fungus Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 (Berkeley, Ryan Muller, strain 1). Consistent with its isolation from the Aglaia plant, this fungus was closely related to known endophytic Ophiocordyceps spp. (Figure 1B and Supplementary file 3; Wang et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2014).

BRM1 on plants producing the antifungal rocaglate led us to hypothesize that the fungus may have a mechanism to evade the toxicity of the compounds. Indeed, the host plant Aglaia achieves this task by introducing an amino acid substitution in eIF4A, a target of rocaglates (Iwasaki et al., 2019). The substituted amino acid (Phe163, amino acid position in human eIF4A1) lies at the critical interface for rocaglate interaction (Figure 2A and D; Iwasaki et al., 2019). Accordingly, we investigated possible amino acid conversions in eIF4As of the Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1. Among the de novo-assembled transcriptome, ~60 DEAD-box RNA binding protein genes, including 4 transcript isoforms of eIF4A, were found (Supplementary file 1).

Indeed, both the Gly-to-Phe (human) and Gly-to-His (O. sinensis) substitutions in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A (Gly172Phe and Gly172His, respectively) sensitized the protein to RocA (Figure 2—figure supplement 2F and G), significantly reducing the Kd (Figure 2C, right, and Table 1). Conversely, introduction of a Gly residue into human and O. sinensis eIF4As reduced the affinity for polypurine RNA (Figure 2C, left, middle; Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and E, and Table 1).

Conversely, introduction of a Gly residue into human and O. sinensis eIF4As reduced the affinity for polypurine RNA (Figure 2C, left, middle; Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and E, and Table 1). A similar rocaglate sensitivity in RNA binding was also observed for adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), a ground-state ATP analog (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–H and Table 1). Unlike ADP + Pi, the nonhydrolyzable analog AMP-PNP allowed basal binding to polypurine RNAs in the absence of RocA. The affinity was further increased by RocA in eIF4A with a Phe or His residues at 163 (human position). In contrast, the proteins with the Gly residue showed the relatively small affinity changes (Figure 2—figure supplement 3I and Table 1). A similar rocaglate sensitivity in RNA binding was also observed for adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), a ground-state ATP analog (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–H and Table 1).

The affinity was further increased by RocA in eIF4A with a Phe or His residues at 163 (human position). In contrast, the proteins with the Gly residue showed the relatively small affinity changes (Figure 2—figure supplement 3I and Table 1). Taking these biochemical data together, we concluded that the Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A evades rocaglate targeting by substituting a critical amino acid involved in its binding. When Phe163 was replaced by Gly in the crystal structure of the human eIF4A1•RocA complex (Iwasaki et al., 2019), the π-π stacking with ring C of RocA was totally lost (Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), likely leading to reduced affinity for RocA. This mechanism to desensitize eIF4A to rocaglates was distinct from the Leu substitution found in Aglaia, which fills the space of the rocaglate binding pocket and thus prevents the interaction (Iwasaki et al., 2019).

This mechanism to desensitize eIF4A to rocaglates was distinct from the Leu substitution found in Aglaia, which fills the space of the rocaglate binding pocket and thus prevents the interaction (Iwasaki et al., 2019). Our data showed that eIF4A with His at position 163 (human position) is also a target of rocaglate (Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, and Table 1). This is most likely due to the functional replacement of the aromatic ring in Phe by the imidazole ring in His for stacking with ring C of rocaglates (Figure 2D). Although compared to the Phe substitution, the His substitution in human and Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4As was accompanied by an attenuated potency of RocA (Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, and Table 1), our data suggested that a wide array of fungi that possess the His variant (Figure 2A), including C. orbiculare (see below for details), are also susceptible to rocaglates.

BRM1 eIF4A confers resistance to rocaglate-induced translational repression The reduced affinity to polypurine RNA gained in the Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A by Gly substitution led us to investigate the impact on rocaglate-mediated translational repression. To test this, we applied a reconstituted translation system with human factors (Iwasaki et al., 2019; Machida et al., 2018; Yokoyama et al., 2019). As observed in an earlier study (Iwasaki et al., 2019), this system enabled the recapitulation of translation reduction from polypurine motif-possessing reporter mRNA but not from mRNA with control CAA repeats in a RocA dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). In contrast, replacing wild-type human eIF4A1 with the Phe163Gly mutant prevented the translation repression mediated by RocA (Figure 3A), consistent with the affinity between the recombinant human eIF4A1 proteins and polypurine RNA (Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, and Table 1).

Given that rocaglate-mediated translational repression is driven by a gain of function (Chen et al., 2021; Iwasaki et al., 2016; Iwasaki et al., 2019), Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A should not have this mode. To investigate this possibility, we used a preformed RocA-eIF4A-mRNA complex for the translation reaction (Iwasaki et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2016). We first preincubated recombinant Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A or the corresponding Gly172His mutant protein with a reporter mRNA possessing polypurine motifs in the presence or absence of RocA. If RocA could target the eIF4A protein, eIF4A should be stably clamped on the polypurine tract, providing steric hindrance to scanning ribosomes and thus repressing protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Whereas WT Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A could not alter translation (Figure 3B, left) due to its weaker ability to clamp on polypurine RNAs, the Gly172His mutant could act as a translation repressor (Figure 3B, right). These data indicated that Gly172His in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A restores the gain-of-function mechanism of RocA.

These data indicated that Gly172His in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A restores the gain-of-function mechanism of RocA. We further tested the impact of the Gly conversion in eIF4A in a fungus. Due to the difficulty of culturing and manipulating the genetics of Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 (data not shown), we instead harnessed C. orbiculare, an anthracnose-causing fungus (Gan et al., 2019; Gan et al., 2013). Through homology-directed repair induced by CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome cleavage, we replaced endogenous eIF4A with wild-type (WT) or Gly-mutated (His153Gly) C. orbiculare eIF4A (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B). Notably, we did not find any significant growth defects resulting from these genetic manipulations (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D).

Notably, we did not find any significant growth defects resulting from these genetic manipulations (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D). Since the culture of the isolated strains requires a significant amount of the compounds, we used aglafoline (methyl rocaglate) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), a less expensive, commercially available natural derivative of rocaglates (Ko et al., 1992), instead of RocA. The difference between RocA and aglafoline is the dimethylamide group versus the methoxycarbonyl group (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), which do not contribute to the association with eIF4A or polypurine RNA (Iwasaki et al., 2019), suggesting that the compounds should have similar mechanisms of action. As expected, aglafoline resulted in essentially the same molecular phenotype of ATP-independent polypurine clamping of the Ophiocordyceps sp.

To understand the translational repression induced by aglafoline in a genome-wide manner, we applied ribosome profiling, a technique based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected RNA fragments (i.e., ribosome footprints) generated by RNase treatment (Ingolia et al., 2019; Ingolia et al., 2009; Iwasaki and Ingolia, 2017), to the isolated fungus strains. The ribosome footprints obtained from C. orbiculare (in the culture of conidia and mycelia) showed the signatures of this experiment: two peaks of footprint length at ~22 nt and ~30 nt (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A), which respectively represent the absence or presence of A-site tRNA in the ribosome (Lareau et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2019), and 3-nt periodicity along the open reading frame (ORF) (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C). By normalizing the footprint reads by the RNA abundance as measured by RNA-Seq, we calculated the translation efficiency and quantified its change induced by aglafoline treatment.

By normalizing the footprint reads by the RNA abundance as measured by RNA-Seq, we calculated the translation efficiency and quantified its change induced by aglafoline treatment. Strikingly, this genome-wide approach revealed that His153Gly confers translational resistance to aglafoline on C. orbiculare. Consistent with the mRNA-selective action of the compound, we observed that a subset of mRNAs showed high aglafoline sensitivity in terms of translation efficiency in conidia (Figure 3C) and that the reduction was compound dose dependent (Figure 3D). Intriguingly, we observed that genes associated with the ribosome and its assembly were susceptible to rocaglate-mediated translational repression (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). The reduction in translation efficiency mediated by aglafoline was attenuated by the His153Gly substitution (Figure 3E). This conclusion was also supported by global translation assessment (Figure 3F), which is based on cytosolic ribosome footprint alterations normalized to the mitochondrial footprints as internal spike-ins (Iwasaki et al., 2016). Consistent with earlier reports (Chen et al., 2021; Chu et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2019; Iwasaki et al., 2016; Iwasaki et al., 2019), the reduction in translation efficiency was associated with the presence of polypurine motifs in the 5′ UTR (Figure 3G). However, the His153Gly substitution compromised the polypurine-dependent translational repression. Although the mycelial stage of the fungus showed the similar trends in translational repression mediated by aglafoline (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–F), the sensitive mRNAs were distinct from those in conidia (Figure 3—figure supplement 3G), suggesting differential impacts of rocaglates during the fungal life cycle.

Rocaglate-resistant fungi show an advantage in infection of plants with rocaglates Rocaglate-resistant fungi show an advantage in infection of plants with rocaglates Rocaglate-resistant fungi show an advantage in infection of plants with rocaglates We were intrigued to test the role of Gly substitution in the parasitic property of fungi. Here, we used the infection process of C. orbiculare on cucumber leaves as a model system. The conidia of WT or His153Gly eIF4A-recombined strains were sprayed on Cucumis sativus (cucumber) cotyledons, and the biomass after inoculation with rocaglate was quantified (Figure 4A). Indeed, aglafoline reduced the biomass of the WT eIF4A-recombined strain on cucumber leaves, showing the antifungal effect of rocaglate (Figure 4B). In stark contrast, the His153Gly mutation in eIF4A affected fungal growth on cucumber leaves and resulted in rocaglate resistance in the fungi (Figure 4B). We note that the differential biomass of C. orbiculare could not be explained by the damage to cucumber leaves by aglafoline treatment as no morphological alteration of the leaves was observed under our conditions (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). These results demonstrated that the Gly substitution found in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A provides the molecular basis of antirocaglate properties and allows the growth of the parasitic fungus in the presence of rocaglate (Figure 5).

Discussion Discussion Since plants often produce antifungal secondary metabolites, a specific compound in the host plant may define the interaction between that plants and parasitic fungi (Pusztahelyi et al., 2015). The antifungal activity of rocaglates may protect Aglaia plants from phytopathogenic fungi (Figure 5, top and middle). Rocaglate may suppress protein synthesis from survival-essential genes such as translation machinery. To survive the presence of rocaglate, which targets the general translation initiation factor eIF4A, this plant adapts eIF4A through specific amino acid substitutions (Phe163Leu-Ile199Met: hereafter, we use the human position to specify amino acid residues) to evade the toxicity of the compounds (Iwasaki et al., 2019). This study showed that the parasitic fungus Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1, which possibly originates from Ophiocordyceps spp. with an endophytic life stage, on Aglaia could also overcome this barrier by introducing an amino acid conversion (Phe163Gly) in eIF4A (Figure 5, bottom). Our results highlighted a tug-of-war between host plants and parasitic fungi through the production of translation inhibitory compounds and mutagenization in the target translation factor.

Our results highlighted a tug-of-war between host plants and parasitic fungi through the production of translation inhibitory compounds and mutagenization in the target translation factor. The molecular basis of secondary metabolite resistance in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 is markedly distinct from the known strategies developed in other fungi. Avenacin from oats — an example of a plant-secreted antimicrobial substance (Morrissey and Osbourn, 1999) — is a triterpenoid that forms complexes with sterols in fungal cell membranes, causes a loss of membrane integrity, and thus exerts an antifungal effect (Armah et al., 1999; Osbourn et al., 1994). To counteract this compound and infect oats, the phytopathogenic fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. avenae (Gga) secretes avenaciase (Crombie et al., 1986; Osbourn et al., 1995), a β-glycosyl hydrolase that hydrolyzes terminal D-glucose in the sugar chain of avenacin. Indeed, avenacin degradation by this enzyme determines the host range of the fungus (Bowyer et al., 1995). In contrast to the detoxification strategy, Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 may cope with rocaglates through desensitization of the target protein eIF4A by an amino acid substitution (Figure 2), leaving the compound intact.

The different resistance mechanisms to toxic small molecules should be highly related to the compound targets. Since sterols targeted by avenacin are biosynthesized via complicated multiple steps with diverse enzymes, thus generating diverse sterol structures, the conversion of target sterols to evade avenacin requires many enzyme modifications and occurs only rarely. On the other hand, the target of rocaglates is an eIF4A protein (and a DDX3 protein, see below for details), and thus, evasion by a single amino acid mutation is relatively likely. These results exemplify the mechanistic diversity of attack and counterattack during plant–fungal pathogen interactions.

These results exemplify the mechanistic diversity of attack and counterattack during plant–fungal pathogen interactions. Although we observed that Gly163 in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A produced a substantial change in sensitivity to rocaglate, the resistance may not be as complete as that obtained by the substitution found in Aglaia Phe163Leu (Iwasaki et al., 2019). Additionally, the translation factor DDX3, which was recently found to be an alternative target of rocaglate (Chen et al., 2021), did not have amino acid substitutions in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A), whereas Aglaia DDX3s harbor a substitution at Gln360 (Chen et al., 2021). This may indicate that Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 is still in the process of evolving fitness for growth in Aglaia plants. Alternatively, the rocaglate-resistant amino acid conversions may involve a trade-off with the basal translation activity. Even with the inefficiency in translation, given that other fungi could not use the resources from the plant, this substitution may still be beneficial to fungi because of the lack of competition from other fungal species. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Although we observed that Gly163 in Ophiocordyceps sp.

Using the best hit sequence as a query, a BLASTn search was performed against the NCBI nucleotide collection (nr/nt) (Supplementary file 2). A multilocus phylogenetic analysis of the Aglaia-infecting fungus with Ophiocordyceps species was performed. A total of 68 isolates were used for phylogenetic analysis, including an Aglaia-infecting fungus, 63 previously classified Ophiocordyceps strains consisting of 52 species, and 4 Tolypocladium species that were expected to serve as outgroups (Supplementary file 3). DNA sequences of ITS, SSU, LSU, TEF1α, and RPB1 were used as previously reported for the classification of Ophiocordyceps species (Xiao et al., 2017). Additional genomic sequences of Ophiocordyceps species identified by BLASTn were added to the analysis (Supplementary file 3). A phylogenetic tree was calculated as previously described (Gan et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017). Each locus (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, and TEF1α) of the 68 isolates (Ban et al., 2015; Castlebury et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2013; de Bekker et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2013; Kepler et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2002; Luangsa-Ard et al., 2011; Luangsa-Ard et al., 2010; Quandt et al., 2018; Quandt et al., 2014; Sanjuan et al., 2015; Schoch et al., 2012; Spatafora et al., 2007; Sung et al., 2007; Wen et al., 2013; Will et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2017) was aligned using MAFFT v7.480 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and trimmed by trimAl v1.4.rev15 (Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009) with an automated setting. The processed sequences obtained from every 68 isolates were concatenated by catfasta2phyml v1.1.0 (Nylander, 2018; https://github.com/nylander/catfasta2phyml) to generate sequences comprising 3910 nucleotide positions, including gaps (gene boundaries ITS, 1–463; LSU, 464–1363; SSU, 1364–2248; RPB1, 2249–2922; TEF1α, 2923–3910).

In this important paper, Chen and colleagues identify a species of fungus, Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1, that is able to grow on Aglaia sp. plants despite their production of rocaglate inhibitors of the eIF4A translation initiation factor. Through a series of convincing experiments, the authors identify an amino acid substitution encoded in the fungal eIF4A gene that preserves eIF4A activity in the presence of these compounds. The authors conclude the substitution evolved to bypass this defense mechanism, similar to the way in which the plant itself bypasses it. The work will be of interest to fungal biologists and colleagues studying plant-microbe interactions. Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) public reviews designed to be posted alongside the preprint for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article "A parasitic fungus employs mutated eIF4A to survive on rocaglate-synthesizing Aglaia plants" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jonathan H Schatz (Reviewer #1). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: 1) Please include evidence that demonstrates the inability of Ophiocordyceps BRM1 to grow in the presence of rocaglate with a change to H153. Since H153 should restore gain-of-function to rocA, it should not be necessary to engineer the Ophiocordyceps BRM1 genome, if any way to express the H153 variant in the organism is achievable. If this can't be achieved, then H153 and G153 together in the same cell-free reporter reaction should result in dominant-negative repression by H153 due to the gain-of-function rocaglate mechanism. This alternative experiment should be very doable as the authors have already purified the protein (Figure 2) and reported a cell-free translation assay (Figure 3A). Even though this translation assay was a reconstituted system with human factors, Ophiocordyceps BRM1 eIF4A bound to RocA should only require a polypurine motif in the reporter 5' UTR to be a dominant negative inhibitor of the scanning ribosome. The authors should include the negative control reporter mRNA (they have previously published this and referred to it as "CAA repeat") along with the 7X AGAGAG reporter mRNA. 2) For Figure 3 and the ribosome profiling data, can the authors confirm the footprint changes are not due to changes in mRNA levels? Determining TE or some similar metric (ribo-seq/rna-seq) would be able to decipher which changes are at the translation or mRNA level. The 6 hr treatments are proper but secondary transcriptional and mRNA decay effects could be accumulating by this point. 3) The manuscript ends with data showing that the gene-edited C. orbiculare strain produces less biomass after 3 days with Aglafoline treatment. Can the authors confirm that this edited strain does not have a growth defect that could alternatively explain the results?

Even though this translation assay was a reconstituted system with human factors, Ophiocordyceps BRM1 eIF4A bound to RocA should only require a polypurine motif in the reporter 5' UTR to be a dominant negative inhibitor of the scanning ribosome. To test the dominant-negative mode of translational repression in vitro by Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A and its Gly-to-His mutant, we first tried to use the corresponding recombinant proteins in the human reconstitution system, as the reviewer suggested. However, Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A could not substitute for human eIF4A in active translation initiation (data not shown), unfortunately. Thus, we instead employed a translation assay with a preformed RocA-eIF4A-mRNA complex (Iwasaki et al. Nature 2016; Iwasaki et al. Mol Cell 2019). In this experiment, we preincubated recombinant Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A or its Gly172His mutant with a reporter mRNA possessing polypurine motifs in the presence or absence of RocA. If RocA can target the eIF4A protein, eIF4A should be stably clamped on the polypurine tract, providing steric hindrance to scanning ribosomes and thus repressing protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). To perform this assay, we first characterized the Gly172His mutant of Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A by a fluorescence polarization assay. Consistent with the effects of His residues in the context of human and O. sinensis eIF4As, the BRM1 eIF4A Gly172His mutant had a higher affinity for polypurine RNA ([AG]10) in the presence of RocA and ADP + Pi than did the Gly residue in the wild-type (see Figure 2C, Figure 2 — figure supplement 2G-H, and Table 1). Then, we used recombinant WT Gly172 and Gly172His mutant proteins for complex preformation and subsequent in vitro translation in RRL. The complex of RocA and the Gly172His mutant on the reporter mRNA supplied steric hindrance for translation initiation (see Figure 3B). On the other hand, WT Gly172 did not have such a function. These data clearly indicated that the His substitution at Gly172 in Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 eIF4A results in a dominant-negative gain-of-function for RocA-mediated translational repression. The authors should include the negative control reporter mRNA (they have previously published this and referred to it as "CAA repeat") along with the 7X AGAGAG reporter mRNA. Regarding Figure 3A, we used the negative control reporter mRNA possessing CAA repeats in the in vitro translation system with purified human factors (see Figure 3A). Consistent with the mode of function of RocA, we did not observe translational repression of this reporter mRNA whether the WT or mutant eIF4A protein was included in the reaction. Notably, we reperformed the experiments with the 7×AGAGAG reporter for side-by-side comparison to the CAA repeat reporter. 2) For Figure 3 and the ribosome profiling data, can the authors confirm the footprint changes are not due to changes in mRNA levels? Determining TE or some similar metric (ribo-seq/rna-seq) would be able to decipher which changes are at the translation or mRNA level. The 6 hr treatments are proper but secondary transcriptional and mRNA decay effects could be accumulating by this point. We truly thank the reviewers for noting this consideration and providing the opportunity to improve our data. We conducted RNA-Seq for the corresponding conditions, measured the translation efficiency across the transcriptome, and redefined the aglafoline-sensitive mRNAs (see Figure 3C). Even with this translation efficiency calculation, we reproduced the aglafoline-mediated translational repression in a dose-dependent and polypurine-selective manner (see Figure 3D, 3G). Importantly, the His153Gly substitution conferred aglafoline resistance in terms of the translation efficiency (see Figure 3E). Thus, our reassessment of the translation efficiency verified the net translation changes induced by aglafoline over the secondary alterations in the mRNA abundance. 3) The manuscript ends with data showing that the gene-edited C. orbiculare strain produces less biomass after 3 days with Aglafoline treatment. Can the authors confirm that this edited strain does not have a growth defect that could alternatively explain the results? According to the reviewers’ suggestion, we measured the colony size as an indicator of cell growth in the engineered C. orbiculare strains (see Figure 3 — figure supplement 1C, 1D) and could not detect any difference.
