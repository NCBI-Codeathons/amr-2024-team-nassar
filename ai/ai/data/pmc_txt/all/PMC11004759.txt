Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) constitute a group of small molecular peptides that exhibit a wide range of antimicrobial activity. These peptides are abundantly present in the innate immune system of various organisms. Given the rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria, microbiological studies have identified AMPs as potential natural antibiotics. In the context of antimicrobial resistance across various human pathogens, AMPs hold considerable promise for clinical applications. However, numerous challenges exist in the detection of AMPs, particularly by immunological and molecular biological methods, especially when studying of newly discovered AMPs in proteomics. This review outlines the current status of AMPs research and the strategies employed in their development, considering resent discoveries and methodologies. Subsequently, we focus on the advanced techniques of mass spectrometry for the quantification of AMPs in diverse samples, and analyzes their application, advantages, and limitations. Additionally, we propose suggestions for the future development of tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of AMPs.

Keywords Introduction Introduction Antimicrobial resistance poses a substantial threat to global health and development, with the prevalence of multidrug resistance becoming increasingly common among pathogenic bacteria. Drug-resistant pathogens are a serious concern in both hospital and non-hospital settings, presenting substantial challenges to the healthcare system, encompassing issues related to the identification, management, and control of infections caused by resistant organisms [1,2]. Therefore, the development and application of new antimicrobial drugs are imminent.

Therefore, the development and application of new antimicrobial drugs are imminent. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short, structurally diverse peptides with a broad spectrum of antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activity [[3], [4], [5]]. Genetically encoded in nature, these peptides typically comprise 10–100 amino acids and are synthesized by diverse organisms as a defense mechanism against microbial invasion [[6], [7], [8]]. They have been reported to be inhibitors of central dogma processes, and blocking DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis [9]. AMPs play a crucial role in the immune defense of multicellular organisms and are currently under investigation for their potential as anti-infective drugs. Their unique ability to target multiple biological targets simultaneously gives AMPs a distinct advantage over traditional antibiotics [10]. An exemplification of this phenomenon is LL-37, which exhibits effects on bacterial cell membranes, in addition to its direct microbicidal, immunomodulatory, and antibiofilm properties [11,12]. The diversity and potency of AMPs make them highly appealing for the development of antimicrobial drugs [13], Currently, many AMPs are being evaluated in clinical trials [14,15]. AMPs have pharmacodynamic properties that effectively reduce the evolution of resistance in target microorganisms. Additionally, they may exhibit synergistic effects with other antimicrobial agents and traditional antibiotics. Overall, AMPs play a critical role in maintaining the health and well-being of organisms by protecting them from infection and regulating various biological processes. Accumulating evidence indicates that AMPs can be used in the treatment of microbial infections in humans [16].

Accumulating evidence indicates that AMPs can be used in the treatment of microbial infections in humans [16]. However, for the clinical application of AMPs, comprehending their inherent biological properties to minimize the potential for unintended harm and to address the current challenge of antibiotic resistance faced by traditional antibiotics is critical [17,18]. Currently, AMPs are primarily detected by using molecular biological methods, immunological methods, and mass spectrometry (MS). Immunodetection assays, including ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting [19,20], have associated limitations. These include cross-reactivity between human heterophile antibodies and the antibodies contained in reagents as well as possible autoantibodies that can lead to error in the results due to defaults or excess values [21]. Additionally, matrix differences between patient sera (hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia) and calibrators present challenges. AMPs can also be detected using molecular research platforms, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), microarray analysis, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) [[22], [23], [24]]. Potential disadvantages of molecular biological detection methods, such as PCR and RT-PCR, include limited sensitivity for detecting low levels of AMPs in complex samples. This may result in false-negative results or underestimation of the true AMP levels. The utilization of molecular techniques introduces the potential for false-positive findings due to contamination. To mitigate the risk of contamination, adequate controls and rigorous quality control measures must be employed. Molecular methods, such as NGS or microarray analysis, can be costly and time-consuming. Consequently, their utility for routine diagnostics or screenings may be limited.

In recent years, MS has emerged as a robust and indispensable tool in the field of chemical and biological analysis, and has been applied in the study of AMPs. MS overcomes these interferences of the detection of immunological methods by not relying on antibodies. It detects protein directly, providing information on the expression, post-translational modifications, and degradation products of the AMPs with higher sensitivity and specificity. The detection of AMPs by tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS) represents a real technological revolution in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Numerous studies exist, but most research on AMPs using MS/MS has primarily focused on two aspects: (1) extracting and characterizing of biologically active peptides for the discovery of new AMPs and (2) exploring possible functional and physiological properties. Therefore, these two aspects are outlined in this review.

To our we knowledge, systematic reviews focusing on the application of MS for AMP detection are currently lacking. Therefore, we aim to comprehensively review and summarize MS techniques in AMP research and application, particularly in the discovery and characterization of novel AMPs from natural sources. Additionally, studies related to AMP discovery, quantitative analysis, characterization, activity, and therapies are emphasized. Finally, this study presents a thorouth analysis of the advantages, limitations, and future perspectives of the methods employed.

Bacteriophage/viral AMPs Bacteriophage/viral AMPs Bacteriophage/viral AMPs Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are viral agents that specifically target and infect bacteria. Within the realm of phage research, numerous proteins have been isolated, including endolysins, depolymerases, and holins, have been isolated and identified as potential alternative antimicrobial agents [[25], [26], [27]]. Phage-encoded endolysins are bacteriolytic proteins that are synthesized during the final stages of the phage lytic cycle. These proteins play a crucial role in breaking down various components of the bacterial cell wall, thereby facilitating the release of phage progeny from the host cells [28]. Two distinct categories of phage amplification systems, namely phage-encoded lysis factors and phage tail complexes, are recognized [[29], [30], [31]].

Bacterial Bacterial Bacterial In gram-positive bacteria, reports have indicated the occurrence of ribosomal and nonribosomal synthesis of AMPs [32]. Bacteriocins, synthesized by ribosomes in bacteria, are considered as bacterial AMPs. These peptides primarily exhibit activity primarily against bacteria closely related to the producer bacteria, necessitating defense mechanisms to counteract potential harmful effects [33]. Bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria are classified into four categories: antibiotics, non-antibiotics, large bacteriocins, and bacteriocins with distinctive structures [34,35]. Numerous bacteriocins can be isolated from bacteria, with the majority originating gram-negative bacilli within the Enterobacteriaceae bacteria family. These AMPs have a narrow spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria and are categorized as categories colicins, colicin-like, microcins, and phage tail-like bacteriocins [35].

Fungal AMPs Fungal AMPs Fungal AMPs Fungal AMPs can be categorized into two primary groups: peptaibols and fungal defensins [36]. Peptaibols, originating mainly comes from the soil fungus Trichoderma [37], are short peptides, typically consisting of 5–21 amino acids. These peptides are characterized by a high proportion of non-proteinogenic amino acids, displaying antifungal activity [38,39]. Defensins, characterized by their short length and high cysteine content, are peptides that are ubiquitously found in microorganisms, plants, and animals [40,41]. Like other AMPs, defensins have demonstrated effectiveness as alternatives to current antifungal therapies, showing potential as novel therapeutic agents or drug leads [42,43].

Plant AMPs Plant AMPs Plant AMPs Cysteine-rich AMPs, widely distributed in plants, which form part of the plant defense systems [44]. Seeds and fruits are particularly valuable sources of diverse AMPs in plants. Cysteine-rich AMPs exhibit persistent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, enabling plants to effectively defend against a wide array of pathogens [44,45]. Currently, plant AMPs are primarily classified according to their structure into α-hairpin proteins, defensins, heme-like peptides, desmin-type peptides, lipid transfer proteins, thionin, snake proteins and unclassified cysteine-rich AMP [46,47].

Animal AMPs Animal AMPs Animal AMPs Various animals, including amphibians, fish, reptiles, birds, mammals, produce AMPs. Invertebrates, lacking adaptive immunity, rely on AMPs as a a vital component of their immune defense. In the case of the invertebrates under investigation, these peptides play a significant role in the immune response [48,49]. These invertebrate AMPs include defensins and cecropin found in insects, defensins found in mollusks and nematodes, macrodefensins found in horseshoe crabs, and invertebrate β-defensins found in crustaceans [[50], [51], [52]]. Vertebrate antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit a range of sizes, spanning from 15 to 200 residues, and fulfill crucial roles in the immediate defense response against pathogens [53]. These AMPs are found in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Fish, in particular, serve as a valuable source of AMPs, expressing various major classes such as cathelicidins, defensins, histone-derived peptides, hepcidins, and a fish-specific class of the cecropin family known as piscidins [54].

Application of MS in AMPs study Application of MS in AMPs study AMP isolation AMP isolation AMP isolation Several pretreatment methods, such as liquid−liquid extraction, protein precipitation, and SPE, are employed for the analysis of biologically small molecular substances using MS/MS detection. Our previous study demonstrated that the magnetic bead method not only automates the sample pretreatment but also greatly reduces the cost compared with that of the SPE method [60]. However, the methods used for protein and peptide extraction are relatively complex. Obtaining peptides, derived from sources such as skin and limb secretions and bacteria, is a relatively complex process. Thus, the extraction of peptides suitable for research, along with considerations of quantity and purity of peptides, constitutes the current focus and challenge in AMPs research. The extraction and purification of AMPs present challenges and yield low quantities, thereby limiting their application in industry and scientific research [61].

During the homogenization stage, some of the samples withstand mechanical damage. The disintegration method is selected based on the physical properties of the sample material. For instance, plant seeds and the dried material are ground in a coffee grinder, whereas frozen portions are crushed in a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. Animal mucus secretions are ground in a blender with an extraction buffer [66]. The extraction process may include additional steps, such as heating [67], removal of excess protein, prefractionation [68], or removal of tannins [69], or degreasing [70], if necessary for large protein peptides or small molecules with higher content. Protein and peptides can be extracted using simple solvent extraction techniques [71].

The conventional methods for peptide extraction are detailed further, starting with simple solvent extraction, including aqueous, organic, and acidic extraction. Subsequently, multiple rounds of centrifugation and subsequent retrieval were performed using methodologies such as ultrafiltration, precipitation, or chromatography. During the homogenization stage, some of the samples withstand mechanical damage. The disintegration method is selected based on the physical properties of the sample material. For instance, plant seeds and the dried material are ground in a coffee grinder, whereas frozen portions are crushed in a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. Animal mucus secretions are ground in a blender with an extraction buffer [66].

Although aqueous extraction is the most commonly used extraction method, but the extract exhibits the lowest antimicrobial capacity. This is evident in studies comparing other extraction methods. In some studies, the aqueous extract did not show any antimicrobial activity [[72], [73], [74]]. Al-Rashed et al. (2018) [72] demonstrated that the aqueous extract did not display antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. Based on the well diffusion method, the acidic crude extract exhibited different antimicrobial activities on agar plates. Phosphate buffer is the most common extractant for isolating AMP [[75], [76], [77]]. Ben Brahim, R et al. (2022) [78] revealed that antimicrobial activity was not observed in extracts obtained using sulfuric acid, dichloromethane, and phosphate buffer extraction. However, some strains were growth inhibited by acetate and sodium acetate extracts. Other studies have reported a growth inhibitory effect on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria with aqueous extracts [[79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84]]. Gikas, E et al.

Organic extractions Organic extractions Organic extractions Organic extractions Organic extractions Among organic extractions, ethanol is the most common solvent, followed by dichloromethane. Organically extracted AMPs have shown high antimicrobial activity [87,88]. This effectiveness can be attributed to two main factors: (1) the presence of hydrophobic groups in antimicrobial molecules, contributing to their affinity for membranes and ability to disrupt them [89]; (2) the use of organic solvents, which reduce interactions between hydrophobic groups in these extracts. Therefore, these extracts contain a high proportion of hydrophobic molecules, thereby hindering the aggregation of such hydrophobic molecules and facilitating their separation [90].

Studies have shown that both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were inhibited [[91], [92], [93]]. However, in a study by Křížkovská, B et al. (2023) [94], the majority of ethanol extracts from European herbs showed low or no toxicity against all strains. Subsequently, clinical multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were tested to determine if ethanol extract could reverse drug-resistance phenotypes. The synergistic effects of breakpoint concentrations of antibiotics and nontoxins were observed. Neither the antibiotic nor the extract was active against the MDR strain when cultured alone. However, a combination of antibiotics and extracts reduced the viability of the MDR strain. Studies have shown that both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were inhibited [[91], [92], [93]].

Acidic extractions Acidic extractions Acidic extractions Acidic extractions Acidic extractions The most common solvent used for acid extraction was acetic acid, followed by trifluoroacetic acid. AMPs are also known as cationic host defense peptides [95,96]. Therefore, the first step in the extraction process was the extraction of proteins and peptides with basic properties during the aqueous extraction of the acid, thus simplifying further separation. The first thionins were isolated using sulfuric acid solutions in the 1970s [97]. Subsequently, the first AMP isolation and purification scheme was proposed. This scheme was modified and applied to the isolation of synthetic anti-LPS peptide Pep19–2.5 [98]. After the addition of 270 μL hydrochloric acid (10 M), the sample was hydrolyzed for 24 h at 120 °C. Subsequently, the solvent was evaporated in a vacuum evaporator for 4 h at 40 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in water to enrich to the applied concentration.

When adopting salt buffer, water, or acid solution as the extraction agent, most protein peptide saturation is achieved by ammonium sulfate solution [[102], [103], [104]]. When seeds with a high total protein content were used, this was done in one or two stages [103,105]. Dialysis is required to remove excess salt, which can be held against water, buffer solutions used during extraction, or solutions needed for further analysis [106]. Dialysis, as a protein separation and purification method, possesses limited purification capabilities. Therefore, a variety of separation methods should be used to effectively separate and purify proteins while preserving their biological properties. In recent years, desalination (low-pressure chromatography) has emerged as an alternative to dialysis. This technique involves the use of hydrophobic adsorbents, such as phenyl-agarose, reverse phase C8, and C18 [[107], [108], [109]]. RP-HPLC has become a primary purification method for peptides and other small compounds due to its good selectivity and high separation performance.

The combination of the aforementioned purification methods often enhances peptide purity. Currently, commonly used purification methods include a combination of gel filtration, ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, and RP-HPLC [[110], [111], [112], [113]] (Fig. 1). In addition to the well-established peptide chemical extraction methods, there are emerging protein and peptide extraction methods such as microwave-assisted extraction, pulsed electric field, and ultrasound-assisted tooth extraction [114]. However, these methods are rarely used in currently studies. Therefore, summarizing all the accumulated experience seems meaningful.

Currently, commonly used purification methods include a combination of gel filtration, ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, and RP-HPLC [[110], [111], [112], [113]] (Fig. 1). In addition to the well-established peptide chemical extraction methods, there are emerging protein and peptide extraction methods such as microwave-assisted extraction, pulsed electric field, and ultrasound-assisted tooth extraction [114]. However, these methods are rarely used in currently studies. Therefore, summarizing all the accumulated experience seems meaningful.

MS detection MS detection MS detection MS detection The peptide extracts were First separated and purified through chromatography. Methanol and acetonitrile are the most commonly used organic phases for HPLC [[115], [116], [117], [118], [119]]. Depending on the types of AMPs detected, an appropriate amount of formic acid, at a low proportion, can be added to either the aqueous phase or organic phase. The flow rate of liquid phase can then be adjusted appropriately for better substance retention. The most commonly used ion source is ESI [[120], [121], [122]]. After separation through LC, the peptide samples underwent ionization and filtration through the ion transport channel and were subsequently detected by the mass detector. The mass-to-charge ratio of the ionized peptides was detected using the mass spectrometer to obtain the primary mass spectrum. It was further detected through secondary MS, which is similar to the primary MS. The secondary MS material is selected using the quadrupole mass analyzer and transported to the collision cell for secondary fragmentation, producing a large number of secondary fragments. The secondary MS detects the fragmented peptide ions to obtain the secondary mass spectrum, whereas the primary MS detects the complete peptide ions.

Previous studies indicate that over 3100 natural AMPs have been described from groups representing life on Earth [4]. However, the research on the application of AMPs through MS primarily focuses on the discovery of new AMPs and the elucidation of their structures, often using high-resolution MS. Additionally, LC−MS/MS has been used to quantitatively detect AMPs. Iram, D et al. (2022) [123] reported the characterization of AMPs from Lactobacillus rhamnosus (C25) fermented goat milk, using high-resolution MS. Nanoflow LC−MS/MS analysis was performed on a Captive spray-Maxis-HD impact II QTOF (Bruker, Germany). Peptides were separated using a C-18, 3 μm nano-trap column (Bruker Magic C18AQ, 0.1 × 150 mm, 3 μm partials size, and 200 A° pore size). A gradient method was used, starting with 2% B at a flow rate of 5 μL/min for 2 min. The gradient increased was increased to 20% B at 46 min, followed by 45% B at 61 min. The gradient was then increased to 95% B in 2 min, which was maintained for 5 min, followed by 2% B at 12 min, resulting in a total run time of 84 min. Analytes were detected using LC−MS in positive ion mode. Previous studies indicate that over 3100 natural AMPs have been described from groups representing life on Earth [4].

The quantitative detection of AMPs is mainly performed using LC−MS/MS.

Data analysis Data analysis Data analysis Data analysis Three commonly used methods exist for the analysis of MS data. The first is the database search [[151], [156], [168]], which involves comparing theoretical enzyme digestion with theoretical fragments to identify peptides that match the MS spectrum. The identification information obtained through this method is derived from the sequences generated by known coding regions in the database. Cochet, MF et al. (2021) [115] used the database to match the mass spectra for data analysis, identifying peptides from the MS/MS spectra using the X!Tandem pipeline software [Plateforme d’Analyze Proteomique de Paris Sud-Ouest (PAPPSO) at INRAE, Jouy-en-Josas, Fragnce; http://pappso.inra.fr]. The search was conducted against a database consisting of reviewed proteins of Gallus gallus, which included 2262 proteins downloaded from the common Repository of Adventitious Protein (http://thegpm.org/crap). The database search parameters were defined as follows: non-specific enzyme cleavage was employed, allowing a mass error of 0.05 Da was allowed for fragment ions and 10 ppm for parent ions. Putative modifications considered in the search included methionine oxidation and serine phosphorylation. Furthermore, a minimum score corresponding to an e-value below 0.05 was deemed necessary for the accurate identification of peptides. Three commonly used methods exist for the analysis of MS data.

The second method is de novo sequencing [174,154], which is a type of secondary spectrum that doed no rely on the database for directly deducing suitable peptides matching. It addresses the challenge of parsing peptides that are not present in the database, such as peptides produced by variable bases in non-coding regions. The de novo sequencing steps for AMPs analysis included mass spectrum data acquisition, peak identification, mass-to-charge ratio extraction, fragment spectrum extraction, fragment spectrum analysis, deduction of amino acid sequence, generation of candidate sequence, evaluation of candidate sequence, and verification of the sequence. De novo sequencing is a complex task that dependent on instrumental resolution, data quality, and analyst experience. Professional mass spectrophotologists usually possess extensive experience in this area to ensure that the inferred sequence is accurate and reliable. It can be combined with other experimental techniques and database information to improve the reliability of amino acid sequence prediction. Grady, EN et al.

However, several challenges persist. First, the variability of sample preparation and the cumbersome nature of sample pretreatment before MS quantitative detection are notable. To achieve a specific detection concentration and purity of the target substance, pretreatment conditions should be explored before applying each quantification method [188,189]. Second, the detection range of MS is limit despite its high sensitivity and specificity [[171], [190], [191]]. After establishing the methodology, the performance of the linear detection range was verified. He, J et al. (2013) [130] established an MS method for the quantification of polymyxin B in mouse serum, demonstrating a linear concentration range of 0.0065–3.2 mg/L. Third, the complexity of the sample matrix is a critical consideration. A diverse range of biological samples, such as blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, skin mucus, and tissue, are used for the extraction of AMPs. Numerous substances present in these biological samples can exert matrix effects on the target substances. These matrix effects pose challenges to the direct analysis of MS, particularly when conducting prompt quantitative investigations [192]. In a study conducted by Song et al.

The results demonstrated that all six peptides exhibited certain antibacterial activity. Cuesta, SA et al. (2021) [201] reported two novel crizole septin-16 and septin-17 peptides. These peptides, initially discovered through molecular cloning and MS/MS, were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis. Their MICs and hemolytic activity were subsequently assessed through experimental testing. The results showed that crizocseptin exhibited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans, with low hemolytic effects. Polymyxin is predominantly used in the treatment of MDR infections in clinical practice, with numerous studies focusing on the detection of polymyxin through LC−MS/MS [111,[127], [131], [134]].
