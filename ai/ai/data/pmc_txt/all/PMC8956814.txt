Lead contact Summary Bergamotenes are bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane sesquiterpenes found abundantly in plants and fungi. Known bergamotene derivatives all possess (2S,6S)-bergamotene backbone. In this study, two (+)-α-trans-bergamotene derivatives (1 and 2) with unusual (2R,6R) configuration were isolated and elucidated from marine fungus Nectria sp. HLS206. The first (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase NsBERS was characterized using genome mining and heterologous expression-based strategies. Based on homology search, we characterized another (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase LsBERS from Lachnellula suecica and an (+)-α-bisabolol synthase BcBOS from Botrytis cinerea. We proposed that the cyclization mechanism of (+)-α-trans-bergamotene involved endo-anti cyclization of left-handed helix farnesyl pyrophosphate by (6R)-bisabolyl cation, which was supported by molecular docking. The biosynthesis-based volatiles (3–6) produced by heterologous fungal expression systems elicited significant electroantennographic responses of Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera frugiperda, respectively, suggesting their potential in biocontrol of these pests. This work enriches diversity of sesquiterpenoids and fungal sesquiterpene synthases, providing insight into the enzymatic mechanism of formation of enantiomeric sesquiterpenes.

More than 80,000 terpenoids have been identified to date (Christianson, 2017). Sesquiterpenoids represent the largest subgroup of terpenoids which have varied applications in pharmaceutical (e.g. artemisinin), biofuels (e.g. farnesene and bisabolene), flavor (e.g. carotenoids), and fragrance (e.g. nerolidol) industries (Miller and Allemann, 2012; Peralta-Yahya et al., 2011). As the well-known constituents of plant essential oils, bergamotenes are a type of bicyclic sesquiterpenes. Some bioactive bergamotene lactones such as massarinolin A (Oh et al., 1999), expansolides C and D (Ying et al., 2017), and purpurolides A and B (Wang et al., 2018) have been isolated from fungi. In the last few decades, bergamotene-type sesquiterpenes having backbones with (2S,6S,7R/S) absolute configuration derived from (6S)-bisabolyl cation have been described and important examples include (−)-α-trans/cis-bergamotene and β-trans/cis-bergamotene (Cane et al., 1990b; Coates et al., 1988; Gibson and Erman, 1969). In this study, we isolated two new (+)-α-trans-bergamotene derivatives 1 and 2 from marine fungus Nectria sp. HLS206. These compounds possess unusual (2R,6R) absolute configurations, which challenged the concept that bergamotene skeleton was exclusively cyclized from (6S)-bisabolyl cation (Li et al., 2019; Sallaud et al., 2009).

In contrast to the increasing number of terpenoids being reported, the characterization of terpene synthases (TPSs) is yet to be explored comprehensively. Nevertheless, in the post-genomic era, the blossoming of sequencing technology and bioinformatics provides the opportunity for the identification of fungal TPSs. The active site contour of TPS serves as a template for catalysis, ensuring that the substrate adopts proper conformation yielding the correct product by complex cascade reaction (Christianson, 2017; Tantillo, 2011). Known fungal sesquiterpene synthases (STSs) mainly belong to class I TPSs which catalyze an ionization-dependent cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and are characterized by signature metal binding motifs DDXXD and NSE which are located on helix D and helix H, respectively (Christianson, 2017).

So far, several plant-derived promiscuous bergamotene synthases belonging to soluble class I TPSs have been identified (Jones et al., 2011; Landmann et al., 2007; Sallaud et al., 2009). However, the only identified fungal bergamotene synthase Fma-TC (β-trans-bergamotene synthase) best known for its significant role in the biosynthesis of fumagillin belongs to the UbiA superfamily (Lin et al., 2013). To the best of our knowledge, no fungal (−)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase has been characterized to date, let alone (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase. To get more insight into this kind of enzyme and to understand its enzymatic mechanism, we sequenced the whole genome of Nectria sp. HLS206. By genome mining and heterologous expression strategies, we found and characterized the first (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase NsBERS (NecD). Upon sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we identified another (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase LsBERS (GenBank: TVY81921.1) and BcBOS (GenBank: XP_001546971.2) that produced (3R)-nerolidol and (+)-α-bisabolol with unusual configurations. We proposed that the enzymatic mechanism involved endo-anti cyclization of a left-handed helix FPP, which was supported by molecular docking.

Necbergamotenoic acid A (1), colorless crystals with [α]D20 +51.5 (c 0.2, CH3OH), had the molecular formula C15H20O4 based on HRESIMS data (m/z 287.1246 [M + Na]+, calcd for C15H20O4Na, 287.1254, Figure S8), indicating six degrees of unsaturation. Analysis of the 1H, 13C and heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR data (Table 1, Figures S10–S12) revealed the presence of two methyl groups, four methylene carbons, four methine carbons (which included two olefinic methine carbons), and five quaternary carbons (which included two disubstituted olefinic carbons and two carboxyl carbons). These results indicated that compound 1 might be a sesquiterpene containing two rings with two double bonds and two carboxylic acid groups. The heteronuclear multiple bond correlations (HMBCs) from H-4 to C-2, C-6 and C-15, from 15-CH3 to C-2 and C-4, from H-1a/1b to C-3 and C-5, from H-1a to C-14, from H-2 to C-4 and C-15 (Figure S13), suggested that compound 1 was α-bergamotane sesquiterpene with bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane ring (Oh et al., 1999), in which 14-CH3 was oxygenated into carboxylic acid. Besides, HMBCs from 13-CH3 to C-10, C-11 and C-12, from H-10 to C-8, C-12 and C-13, from H-9 to C-7 and C-11, from H-8 to C-2, C-6, C-10 and C-14, indicated the presence of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid group in the side chain (Figures 1B and S13). The double bond between C-10 and C-11 was assigned as E geometry based on the strong rotating frame overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) correlation between H-9 and 13-CH3 (Figure S15). The homonuclear correlation spectroscopy (COSY) spectrum (Figures 1B and S14) revealed two spin systems (-4CH5CH26CH1CH22CH- and -8CH29CH210CH-), which further elucidated the planar structure of 1 as shown in Figure 1A. The single crystals of 1 were generated, and X-ray crystallography was performed subsequently using Gu Kα radiation, which confirmed the structure and determined the absolute configuration of 1 (2R,6R,7R) (Figure 1C, Table S1). To our knowledge, this is the first time that a natural bergamotene derivative in this configuration has been identified.Table 1The 1H NMR (500 MHz) and13C NMR (125 MHz) data of necbergamotenoic acid A (1), necbergamotenoic acid B (2) and its ionized form (2′)No1a2b2′bδH mult.

D +100.9 (c 0.2, CH3OH), and its molecular formula was established as C15H22O4 on the basis of HRESIMS at m/z 289.1405 [M + Na]+ (calcd for C15H22O4Na, 289.1410, Figure S17), requiring five degrees of unsaturation. Compared with the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of compound 1, one oxygenated methine signal at δH 4.70, δC 67.1, two oxygenated methylene signals at δH 3.72, 3.37, δC 63.7 appeared and one carboxyl carbon signal at δC 181.6 was missing (Table 1, Figures S19–S21), which indicated the presence of two hydroxyl groups in the α-bergamotenoic acid. Further analysis of COSY and HMBC spectra determined the hydroxyl groups were assigned to C-9 and C-14 (Figures 1B, S22 and S23). The relative stereochemistry of the skeleton of compound 2 was determined as (10E)-α-trans-bergamotenoic acid based on ROESY correlations (Figures S24) between H-14a/H-4 and H-9/13-CH3, which was the same as 1. Since the qualified crystals of 2 were not obtained and any useful information could not be acquired by Mosher’s method, we deduced the absolute configuration of the skeleton of 2 as 2R,6R,7R based on the biosynthetic pathway, but the absolute configuration of C-9 is still waiting for the determination (Figure 1A).

The ionized form of necbergamotenoic acid B (2′) was also isolated as a yellowish gum. Its HRESIMS spectrum showed the positive ion peak at m/z 289.1403 (calcd for C15H22O4Na, 289.1410, Figure S26), which was the same as that of 2. In the IR spectrum of 2′ (Figure S27), the carbonyl group had two bands situated at 1573 and 1426 cm−1 that are typical of ionized groups (RCOO−) (Max and Chapados, 2004). On basis of 1D NMR (1H and 13C NMR, Table 1, Figures S28, S29 and 2D NMR (HSQC, HMBC, COSY and ROESY, Figures S30–S33) spectra, the structure of 2′ was confirmed and all the1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts were assigned as Table 1. The carbon signals of C-11 and C-12 for α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid group in ionized form (2′) shifted downfield about 5 ppm, which was consistent with the results reported in the literature (Cistola et al., 1982).

HLS206 To explore how α-trans-bergamotene was synthesized in fungi, specifically (+)-α-trans-bergamotene, the whole genome of Nectria sp. HLS206 was sequenced and submitted to anti-SMASH 4.0 (Blin et al., 2017) for prediction of terpene biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Excluding prenyltransferases and squalene synthases, only two candidate STSs (Nec04 and Nec26) were predicted. However, no oxidative tailoring enzyme was found adjacent to them. Using local BLAST with over 50 fungal STSs probes, another candidate sesquiterpene synthase NecD (scaffold 23) was mined although it was targeted by only a few probes with low identities/positives (∼25%/45%). The gene annotation of upstream and downstream of necD revealed three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (NecB, NecC and NecE), which could be responsible for the oxidation from (+)-α-trans-bergamotene to 1 and 2 (Figure 2A, Table S4). Furthermore, necA encodes a p53 inducible quinone oxidoreductase PIG3 involving cellular responses to oxidative stress (Porte et al., 2009) which seemed to be a self-resistance enzyme (SRE). As a result, we hypothesized that NecD may be responsible for the biosynthesis of (+)-α-trans-bergamotene skeleton.Figure 2The sesquiterpenome of Nectria sp.

The asterisks represent minor products of AN-nec26 and the triangle represents dodecanol at 10.35 min. The Aspergillus nidulans host system has been proved to be capable of heterologous terpene production. To verify our above-mentioned hypothesis, we cloned nec04, nec26 and necD genes from HLS206 gDNA and conducted heterologous expression in A. nidulans for functional analysis. The organic layers covering on the fermentation were analyzed by GC-MS. In comparison with the mock transformant, the sole product of AN-necD at 9.9 min (3) and the main product of AN-nec26 at 12.9 min (4) were identified as bergamotene and trichoacorenol by NIST library respectively, while no new product was found in AN-nec04 (Figure 2B).

Compounds 3 and 4 were purified from AN-necD and AN-nec26 fermentation, respectively, and their structures were determined using NMR spectroscopy.

D −6 (c 0.1, CHCl3) of 4 was consistent with previous study [α]20
D −5.2 (c 0.12, CHCl3) (Brock and Dickschat, 2011). Thus 4 was assigned as (−)-trichoacorenol and Nec26 was defined as NsTAS.

By comparing the NMR data (Table S2, Figures S35 and S36) with the reported data (Sy and Brown, 1997), the relative structure of 3 was identified as α-trans-bergamotene consistent with that of compound 1. Furthermore, the specific rotation of 3 was positive and opposite to that of (−)-α-trans-bergamotene (Chapuis et al., 1998), implying that the absolute configuration of 3 was 2R,6R,7S (Figure 2B). The positive cotton effect at 209 nm of 3 was contrary to that of (−)-S-α-pinene in the CD spectrum (Figure S37) (Mason and Schnepp, 1973), further proving that the absolute configuration of 3 was consistent with that of 1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of (+)-α-trans-bergamotene skeleton.

By fusion with N-terminal MBP-His6 tag, the soluble fusion protein (91 kDa) was acquired by affinity chromatography (Figure S1). Incubation of NsBERS with FPP and Mg2+ resulted in the formation of sole product 3 (Figure S2). Additionally, Mn2+ and Co2+ can also be used as the cofactors of NsBERS and the optimal concentration of divalent metal ion was tested (Figure S3). The enzyme activity was insensitive to the concentration of Mg2+ (at the range from 0.005 mM to 500 mM). The total amount of product reached a maximum at concentrations of 0.2 mM Mn2+ and 1 mM Co2+, while higher concentrations led to activity loss. Substrate promiscuity assay showed that NsBERS cannot accept GPP and GGPP as substrates (Figure S4).

However, the clade IV conserved in 1,6 cyclization is predominantly constituted by basidiomycetes STSs than ascomycetes STSs and genes in clade IV seem to be involved in horizontal gene transfer from basidiomycetes to ascomycetes. NsBERS is away from this clade and located in clade III in which FgFS (Bian et al., 2018), FfAAS (Brock et al., 2013) and Hyp3 (Shaw et al., 2015) also exhibited 1,6 cyclization but shared only ∼26% identity with NsBERS (Figure S5). This phenomenon signified that there must exist STSs which are more phylogenetically related to NsBERS, therefore NsBERS may have the potential to facilitate the discovery of relevant fungal STSs. We performed a homology search in NCBI and got a set of uncharacterized NsBERS homologues belonging to the genera of Botrytis, Bipolaris, Metarhizium, Lachnellula, and so on separately (Table S6). After redundancy removal, the sequences with over 45% identity with NsBERS were chosen to analyze the phylogenetic relation, and a new subclade was formed (Figure 3). We hypothesized that this NsBERS-like subclade may well possess a similar cyclization mechanism and form similar products.

Thus, TVY81921.1 as the second (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase was named as LsBERS, and XP_001546971.2 was designated as BcBOS which is the first identified fungal (+)-α-bisabolol synthase. Although (3R)-nerolidol and (+)-α-bisabolol were deemed to occur rarely as a constituent of natural products (Laurini et al., 2020), some related STSs derived from plants have been reported recently. For instance, the reports of maize TPS1 producing ∼29% (3R)-nerolidol (Schnee et al., 2002) and several (+)-α-bisabolol synthases from the genus Artemisia (Muangphrom et al., 2016, 2019) indicated the lack of comprehensive studies in the domain of sesquiterpene enantiomers. Further NMR analysis (Table S2) and the specific rotation indicated that the product of TVY81921.1 was (+)-α-trans-bergamotene ([α]20

LsBERS exhibited the same properties as NsBERS, and the in vitro assay of the 92 kDa soluble fusion protein also contributed to the formation of 3 (Figure S3). However, the ratio of BcBOS products was influenced by many factors such as the type and concentration of metal cofactor (Lopez-Gallego et al., 2010). The higher ratio of linear nerolidol can be detected in vitro when Mg2+ is used as the cofactor. Substitution of Mg2+ with Co2+ shifted the product profile to a higher (+)-α-bisabolol ratio, and higher concentration of Co2+ can contribute to higher ratio of cyclization product, implying that metal coordination interactions may play a significant role in governing the substrate binding conformation prior to the initiation of cyclization cascade (Christianson, 2017).

The proposed mechanism of (+)-α-trans-bergamotene The proposed mechanism of (+)-α-trans-bergamotene The proposed mechanism of (+)-α-trans-bergamotene At this point in the study, NsBERS, LsBERS and BcBOS, which produced sesquiterpene backbones with unusual absolute configurations were characterized. Apparently, the C6 of 3 and 6 did not participate in further rearrangements and retained their configurations, that is, (+)-α-trans-bergamotene and (+)-α-bisabolol were both derived from (6R)-bisabolyl cation. These enzymes can be good models for studying the formation of (6R)-bisabolyl cation and pursing the difference with (6S)-bisabolyl cation. A general stereochemical model for bicyclic monoterpene proposed by Croteau et al. (Croteau, 1987) has been applied to elucidate the conformation control of (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase (Whittington et al., 2002), 1,8-cineole synthase (Kampranis et al., 2007), (±)-α-pinene synthases (Croteau and Satterwhite, 1989) and (±)-limonene synthases (Kumar et al., 2017), respectively. A more recent computational chemistry study investigating the mechanism of santalenes produced by santalene synthase (SaSSy) has illustrated that the (6S)-bisabolyl cation is formed via endo-anti cyclization in the right-handed helix of FPP (Jindal and Sunoj, 2012) which is similar to those of (−)-α-pinene synthase and (−)-limonene synthase. Although (6R)-bisabolyl cation is possibly formed via the exo-anti cyclization of the right-handed helix of FPP, it is unfavorable for the subsequent C2–C7 bond formation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the (6R)-bisabolyl cation formed adopts the mirror image via endo-anti cyclization in the left-handed helix of FPP during the cyclization of (+)-α-trans-bergamotene (Figure 5).Figure 5The proposed left-handed endo-anti cyclization mechanism of NsBERS, LsBERS and BcBOS(A) (2E,6E)-FPP; (B) (3R)-NPP; and (C) (+)-α-trans-bergamotene were docked into NsBERS model, while (D) (2E,6E)-FPP; (E) (3S)-NPP; and (F) (−)-α-trans-bergamotene were docked into LaBERS model.

The crystal structure of (4S)-limonene synthase complex (PDB: 2ONH) was used as the template for homology modeling of LaBERS. To verify the hypothesis, homology modeling of NsBERS was carried out by adopting AaTPS (PDB: 6LCD) as the template (He et al., 2020). The crystal structure of AaTPS only bound two Mg2+ and the DDXXD motif on the helix D was apparently away from the pyrophosphate (PPi), implying incomplete closure of the active site. Although this may lead to deviation in the position of PPi, the results of the molecular docking of (2E,6E)-FPP displayed almost consistent left-handed endo-anti conformation (Figure 5A). The alternative suitable substrate (3R)-NPP and the product (+)-α-trans-bergamotene also exactly resembled the predicted mechanism (Figures 5B and 5C). The bent contour of active cavity must play an important role in controlling the pre-folding state of the substrate, while sulfur-cation interaction (dative S → cation bonded state) (Dixit et al., 2017) may anchor the cation intermediate in a reactive conformation. Furthermore, LaBERS from Lavandula angustifolia (mainly producing (−)-α-trans-bergamotene with a ratio of 74%) was chosen to illustrate the symmetrical state (Figures 5D–5F), due to the fungus-derived (−)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase was still not identified. The stabilization effect of W263 and M280 on cation supported the right-handed conformation, but the vertical shape of active cavity cannot guarantee the formation of C2–C7 bond to its maximum extent, which led to formation of linear sesquiterpene byproducts.

The results revealed that all of these volatiles can induce EAG responses (Figure 6). Especially, 5 elicited the highest responses of both H. armigera and S. frugiperda.

Discussion Discussion Polycyclic terpenoids usually have multiple chiral centers, and the chiral terpene pool has long served as the building blocks for chemical synthesis of complex natural products (Brill et al., 2017). However, a lot of sesquiterpenoids were identified only based on comparison of standards and NIST library, which overlooked the stereochemistry. In fact, it is essential to emphasize the pertinence of a more comprehensive understanding of stereochemistry of sesquiterpenoids, which will not only facilitate understanding the biogenesis of naturally occurring enantiomers but also will provide insight into enzymatic mechanism of precise stereochemistry control. In the last decades, bergamotene derivatives isolated from plants and fungi have been known to possess the (2S,6S) ring configurations. In this study, the isolation and identification of necbergamotenoic acids A and B (1 and 2) from marine fungus Nectria sp. HLS206 with (2R,6R) configurations broke this notion and enriched the chemical diversity of the bergamotene skeleton.

HLS206 with (2R,6R) configurations broke this notion and enriched the chemical diversity of the bergamotene skeleton. To investigate the biosynthetic mechanism, the whole genome of Nectria sp. HLS206 was sequenced and detailed bioinformatics-based analyses were carried out. By genome mining and heterologous expression in A. nidulans, we characterized the first (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase NsBERS with high fidelity. Upon homology search and phylogenetic analysis, we identified another (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase LsBERS and the first fungal (+)-α-bisabolol synthase BcBOS which indicated that NsBERS is a representative of untouched land and has the potential to facilitate discovery of relevant fungal STSs. The unusual stereochemistry of compounds 3, 5 and 6 revealed that the structure elucidation of sesquiterpene enantiomers has been ignored to a degree. In addition, the disregard for NsBERS-like subclade proved that fungal STSs are still relatively unexplored and comprehensive studies designed to get a more in-depth understanding are pertinent. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis showed that fungal STSs initiating 1,6 cyclization reaction were apparently grouped into two clades (clade III and clade IV). Apart from metal ion binding motifs, these two clades have no sequence similarity and tend to be conserved in some residues respectively (Figure S6), which may contribute to differences in overall fold of protein structures. It also gives a hint that genes of STSs in clade IV may be involved in horizontal gene transfer from basidiomycetes to ascomycetes. Future studies involving these two clades may provide insight into the mechanism and evolution of fungal 1,6 cyclization STSs. To investigate the biosynthetic mechanism, the whole genome of Nectria sp. HLS206 was sequenced and detailed bioinformatics-based analyses were carried out. By genome mining and heterologous expression in A. nidulans, we characterized the first (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase NsBERS with high fidelity. Upon homology search and phylogenetic analysis, we identified another (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase LsBERS and the first fungal (+)-α-bisabolol synthase BcBOS which indicated that NsBERS is a representative of untouched land and has the potential to facilitate discovery of relevant fungal STSs. The unusual stereochemistry of compounds 3, 5 and 6 revealed that the structure elucidation of sesquiterpene enantiomers has been ignored to a degree.

Based on the general stereochemical model for bicyclic monoterpene, it was inferred that the endo-anti cyclization in the left-handed helix of FPP formed the (+)-α-trans-bergamotene by (6R)-bisabolyl cation, which was further supported by our molecular docking results. The superposition of (±)-limonene synthases and substrate analogues complexes revealed that it is likely that the steric hindrance leads to the different conformations which yield the divergent absolute configurations subsequently (Kumar et al., 2017). As a result, the identification of fungal (−)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase will probably facilitate the mechanism with more details.

Known as the constituent of plant essential oil, (−)-α-trans-bergamotene was found to play a dual role in flowers and leaves of Nicotiana attenuata, solving the dilemma when pollinators are also herbivores (Zhou et al., 2017). The EAG results showed that (+)-α-trans-bergamotene (3) elicited a significantly higher response of females than males of H. armigera, which signified that 3 can potentially attract female moths to oviposit suggesting its potential in biocontrol of H. armigera. More behavioral orientation-based assays are underway.

Fungal SRE has been known to be insensitive to the inhibitors (compounds encoded by BGC) and enable the producing organism to survive, illustrating that the SRE in the BGC can serve as a predictive window to the bioactivity of the natural product (Yan et al., 2020). Some representative examples of SREs including the herbicide target AstD (Yan et al., 2018), MetAP-2 of fumagillin cluster (Lin et al., 2013), and HMGR of lovastatin cluster (Kennedy et al., 1999) have been well studied. Our further bioinformatic analysis showed that NecA is the second copy of PIG3 encoded in the genome and has 44% identity with the housekeeping copy PIG3 (scaffold 6) in HLS206, implying that NecA is a variant of housekeeping PIG3. Apart from the nec cluster, we observed that the PIG3 variants, NsBERS-like enzymes and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases co-localized in many phytopathogen BGCs (Figure S7), for instance, the lach cluster (GenBank: QGMK01000402.1) where LsBERS (TVY81921.1) is located (Figure 2A, Table S5). Based on this, we speculated that the encoded compounds of these BGCs serve as PIG3 inhibitors accelerating infection and plant cell death by regulating the host reactive oxygen species (Peng et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2011). In addition, knocking down PIG3 has been reported to increase the sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) to docetaxel by dysregulating the dynamics of microtubules (Li et al., 2017), signifying that the putative PIG3 inhibitor compounds 1 and 2 may be potential adjuvants of docetaxel for NSCLC. We will be committed to confirming these potential bioactivities and revealing the underlying mechanisms.

Limitations of the study Limitations of the study Limitations of the study In this study, we deciphered the biosynthesis of unusual (2R,6R)-α-trans-bergamotene, and proposed the cyclization mechanism which was supported by molecular docking. However, the docking results did not present the completely symmetrical state because of the differences between plant-derived STSs and fungus-derived STSs in overall fold, especially in active cavity. In addition, in comparison with the protein crystal structure analysis, homology modeling and molecular docking have limitations and are not precise enough for some details. Therefore, it is hard to predict which residue was the determinant of absolute configuration. Thus, the crystalization and three-dimensional analysis of both two types of enantiomeric synthases and their enzyme-substrate complexes will facilitate the enzymatic mechanism deciphering with more details.
