Abstract To identify the potential role of the 3‐hydroxyl group of the pyridine ring in nosiheptide (NOS) for its antibacterial activity against Gram‐positive pathogens, enzymatic glycosylation was utilized to regio‐selectively create a monoglycosyl NOS derivative, NOS‐G. For this purpose, we selected OleD, a UDP glycosyltransferase from Streptomyces antibioticus that has a low productivity for NOS‐G. Activity of the enzyme was increased by swapping domains derived from OleI, both single and in combination. Activity enhancement was best in mutant OleD‐10 that contained four OleI domains. This chimer was engineered by site‐directed mutagenesis (single and in combination) to increase its activity further, whereby variants were screened using a newly‐established colorimetric assay. OleD‐10 with I117F and T118G substitutions (FG) had an increased NOS‐G productivity of 56%, approximately 70 times higher than that of wild‐type OleD. The reason for improved activity of FG towards NOS was structurally attributed to a closer distance (<3 Å) between NOS/sugar donor and the catalytic amino acid H25. The engineered enzyme allowed sufficient activity to demonstrate that the produced NOS‐G had enhanced stability and aqueous solubility compared to NOS. Using a murine MRSA infection model, it was established that NOS‐G resulted in partial protection within 20 h of administration and delayed the death of infected mice. We conclude that 3‐hydroxypyridine is a promising site for structural modification of NOS, which may pave the way for producing nosiheptide derivatives as a potential antibiotic for application in clinical treatment. A monoglycosyl nosiheptide, which exhibit improved solubility and stability compared to nosiheptide, was created by enzymatic glycosylation. By enzyme engineering coupled with a new colorimetric method, a chimeric enzyme with approximately 70 times higher activity was constructed. These findings suggest the potential for structural modifications at the 3‐hydroxypyridine site of nosiheptide to develop novel nosiheptide derivatives with improved properties for clinical treatment.

INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Nosiheptide (NOS), originally discovered as a product of Streptomyces actuosus (Benazet et al., 1980), is a typical representative of an e‐series thiopeptide. This compound exhibits a nanomolar antibacterial potency in vitro against various Gram‐positive pathogens, including methicillin‐resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), vancomycin‐resistant Enterococci (VRE) and Clostridium difficile (Bagley et al., 2015; Haste et al., 2012; Tsutsumi et al., 2014). As previously reported, NOS exerts its antibacterial effect by inserting itself into the GTPase‐associated centre (GAC) of the bacterial ribosome, which is formed by protein L11 and 23S rRNA of the 50S subunit, consequently disturbing bacterial protein biosynthesis (Harms et al., 2008). This highly specific mode of action and its prominent minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) suggested NOS could be a promising “last‐resort” antibiotic against Gram‐positive pathogens, in particular to combat multi‐drug resistant, extensively resistant and pan‐drug resistant strains (Magiorakos et al., 2012), potentially providing an alternative to vancomycin and its derivatives. However, a lack of in vivo effects provides a barrier against clinical applications of NOS. Thus far, NOS is only approved as a feed additive for livestock (Xie et al., 2019).

However, a lack of in vivo effects provides a barrier against clinical applications of NOS. Thus far, NOS is only approved as a feed additive for livestock (Xie et al., 2019). It is assumed that the failure of NOS to act in vivo is due to its poor aqueous solubility and its structural instability in blood (Fan et al., 2021; Vinogradov & Suga, 2020). To address this issue, structural modifications of NOS have been produced by chemical and biosynthetic methods (Fan et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2022; Vinogradov & Suga, 2020; Zhang, Guo, et al., 2020), but derivatives with a confirmed in vivo activity have not been achieved so far. NOS contains a dehydroalanine tail and an indolic acid moiety, and owing to its structural complexity, there are few regions suitable to be modified (Figure 1). This largely limits the diversity of NOS‐based analogues for drug development. To increase the variation in potential structural variants, the central 3‐hydroxypyridine ring of NOS would be an ideal target for modification, based on its chemical reactivity, but the required deep‐cleft binding mode in the GAC of the bacterial ribosome, which is crucial for its mode of action (Tsutsumi et al., 2014), might prevent modifications of the 3‐hydroxypyridine group, as it might inactivate the compound. As a consequence, 3‐hydroxypyridine‐modified derivatives are uncommonly created or explored for antibacterial effectiveness (Fan et al., 2021; Kimber & Moody, 2008; Liu et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2022; Vinogradov & Suga, 2020; Wojtas et al., 2016; Zhang, Guo, et al., 2020).

Glycosylation can potentially lead to altered functions of drugs, and this approach is used to inactivate an antibiotic in its producing strain to generate self‐resistance, as exemplified by naturally produced glycosylated macrolides and ansamycins (Liang et al., 2015). Here, we assessed if specific monoglycosylation of the 3‐hydroxypyridine group of NOS would be feasible to change its activity. Given the similar reactivity of three hydroxyl groups present in NOS (Figure 1), site‐specific O‐monoglycosylation of the 3‐hydroxypyridine core by a glycosyltransferase was our method of choice, as chemical modification would be uncontrollable for site‐selectivity (Zhao et al., 2020). Although there are at least 116 families of glycosyltransferases deposited in the CAZy database (http://www.cazy.org/), the relatively bulky and rigid structure of NOS complicated the search for a suitable enzyme, which had to combine site‐selectivity with a broad substrate specificity.

To this purpose, we initially screened 23 enzymes and identified UDP‐glycosyltransferase OleD from Streptomyces antibioticus as a suitable candidate. This well‐explored member of GT‐B fold enzymes can glycosylate diverse natural or artificial substrates (Bolam et al., 2007; Gantt et al., 2013; Hughes et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2013). We found that the enzyme OleD was indeed capable of O‐glycosylating 3‐hydroxypyridine in NOS using UDP‐glucose (UDPG) as the sugar donor, albeit with a very low efficiency. To improve its efficiency, we engineered OleD by swapping functional enzyme domains with domains from another glycosyltransferase. The approach successfully created a chimera that combined OleD and OleI domains with excellent activity towards the 3‐hydroxypyridine group of NOS. Following targeted site‐directed mutagenesis to increase enzyme activity even further, enough monoglycosyl NOS (NOS‐G) was produced to test its activity in vivo. NOS‐G displayed a better protection effect in MRSA‐infected mice compared to unmodified NOS, indicating that 3‐hydroxypyridine is a permissible target site for structural modification of NOS. Thus, this study not only provides a new method to create chimeric enzymes for site‐specific glycosylation of NOS but also for the first time demonstrates a possible target site to improve the druggability of NOS.

Then, 60 μL was mixed with an equal volume of DNS solution for colorization and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm. A standard curve with variable fructose concentrations was produced using the values of A540 (Y) and the fructose concentration (X). A regression equation for fructose at concentrations below 0.1 mM was derived as Y = 2.037X−0.031 (R
2 = 0.999), while above 0.1 mM it was Y = 1.703X−0.009 (R

Within this linearity, the recovery rate, limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the colorimetric method were determined with reference to the literature (Fernando & Soysa, 2015). For the recyclable production of fructose, the gene of OleD‐10 was inserted into a pETDuet‐AtSUS containing a sucrose synthase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana (GenBank: OAP16120.1) using NcoI and HindIII.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Screening of a suitable glycosyltransferase for the glycosylation of NOS Screening of a suitable glycosyltransferase for the glycosylation of NOS Screening of a suitable glycosyltransferase for the glycosylation of NOS In order to identify a suitable glycosyltransferase for site‐specific glycosylation of the 3‐hydroxypyridine group of NOS, we identified 23 enzymes (glycosyltransferases and glycosynthases) from different origins (Table S2) that were heuristically selected to conduct transglycosylation of NOS, regardless of their stereo‐ and site‐selectivity. These enzymes were expressed in E. coli with the parameters provided in Table S3, resulting in 17 soluble glycosyltransferases (Figure S1A,B) or glycosynthases (Figure S1A,C). Their activity in cell‐free extracts to glycosylate NOS using UDP‐glucose as the sugar donor was assessed, with reaction conditions summarized in Table S4. By means of LC‐MS analysis, we found that only OleD, a well‐studied GT1 family glycosyltransferase from S. antibioticus (Bolam et al., 2007; Gantt et al., 2013; Hughes et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2013), produced a new compound. This product displayed a higher hydrophilicity than NOS (Figure S2A) with an [M+H]+ value of 1384.35 (Figure S2B), implying that NOS had been glycosylated. After upscaling the reaction and semi‐preparative chromatographic purification, 8.9 mg of this product was obtained with a purity over 96%. A series of NMR analyses was performed that structurally identified this product as a monoglycosyl derivative of NOS (named NOS‐G). It contained a newly‐formed β‐O‐glycosidic bond that linked C1 of glucose with the hydroxyl group of 3‐hydroxypyridine in NOS (Table S8). Thus, the site‐selective modification of 3‐hydroxypyridine in NOS had been successful, but the production rate of NOS‐G was still lower than 1% after optimizing the reaction system. To improve yields, OleD had to be engineered to improve its glycosylation efficiency of NOS.

Rational selection of fragments to prepare chimeric OleD Rational selection of fragments to prepare chimeric OleD Rational selection of fragments to prepare chimeric OleD In addition to random or site‐mutagenesis strategies, swapping functional domains through recombination in a (semi‐) rational manner can be an effective way to improve the catalytic characteristics of an enzyme, as was shown for improving substrate specificity, catalytic efficiency, or operational stability (Krauth et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2015). The 3D structure of glycosyltransferase OleD from S. antibioticus contains a large “open” active centre, formed by functionally independent N‐ and C‐terminal domains linked via a short flexible segment (Bolam et al., 2007). These characteristics led us to improve the catalytic efficiency of OleD for biosynthesis of NOS‐G by employing a domain‐swapping approach, even though this method has seldom been used to modify glycosyltransferases.

A high similarity of amino acid sequences between two parent enzymes is critical to obtain a functional glycosyltransferase chimera (Krauth et al., 2009; Weis et al., 2008), because it contributes to maintain the structural topology of the enzyme. Based on this, we selected S. antibioticus glycosyltransferase OleI, which has a similar glycosylation activity as OleD towards diverse macrolides (Bolam et al., 2007), to act as the donor for domain replacement of OleD. OleI exhibited over 45% amino acid (aa) sequence identity compared to OleD. We named the methodology of domain replacement between closely related enzymes with similar functions OFREDS, short for Origin and Function‐Related Enzyme Domain Swapping. After a comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences and 3D structures of both enzymes (Bolam et al., 2007), six regions with distinct differences were identified which we focused on to be exchanged (Figure 2A). Region 1 (aa 1–5 in OleD and 1–10 in OleI) at the N‐terminal and Region 2 (aa 403–415 in OleD but missing in OleI) located at the C‐terminal without resolved X‐ray structures were predicted to be related to the stability of the enzymes (Figure 2B). Regions 3 (aa 65–84 in OleD and aa 70–89 in OleI) and 5 (aa 326–340 in OleD and aa 346–362 in OleI) contained major structural differences in the binding sites of the sugar acceptor domain, which might contribute to substrate affinity and specificity of the glycosyltransferases. The strongly different K

m
 values of OleD and OleI towards UDP‐glucose led us to also exchange the PSPG motif in region 4 (aa 282–319 in OleD and 304–341 in OleI), although this motif is highly conserved in UDP‐glycosyltransferases for the binding of UDP‐sugar (Zhang, Yi, et al., 2022). Lastly, an extensive difference in the N‐terminal sequence of region 6 was noted (missing in OleD and aa163–181 in OleI) (Figure 2B) and this domain might be important for the catalytic efficiency of both OleD and OleI.

Region 1 (aa 1–5 in OleD and 1–10 in OleI) at the N‐terminal and Region 2 (aa 403–415 in OleD but missing in OleI) located at the C‐terminal without resolved X‐ray structures were predicted to be related to the stability of the enzymes (Figure 2B). Regions 3 (aa 65–84 in OleD and aa 70–89 in OleI) and 5 (aa 326–340 in OleD and aa 346–362 in OleI) contained major structural differences in the binding sites of the sugar acceptor domain, which might contribute to substrate affinity and specificity of the glycosyltransferases. The strongly different K

 values of OleD and OleI towards UDP‐glucose led us to also exchange the PSPG motif in region 4 (aa 282–319 in OleD and 304–341 in OleI), although this motif is highly conserved in UDP‐glycosyltransferases for the binding of UDP‐sugar (Zhang, Yi, et al., 2022). Lastly, an extensive difference in the N‐terminal sequence of region 6 was noted (missing in OleD and aa163–181 in OleI) (Figure 2B) and this domain might be important for the catalytic efficiency of both OleD and OleI. A high similarity of amino acid sequences between two parent enzymes is critical to obtain a functional glycosyltransferase chimera (Krauth et al., 2009; Weis et al., 2008), because it contributes to maintain the structural topology of the enzyme. Based on this, we selected S. antibioticus glycosyltransferase OleI, which has a similar glycosylation activity as OleD towards diverse macrolides (Bolam et al., 2007), to act as the donor for domain replacement of OleD. OleI exhibited over 45% amino acid (aa) sequence identity compared to OleD. We named the methodology of domain replacement between closely related enzymes with similar functions OFREDS, short for Origin and Function‐Related Enzyme Domain Swapping. After a comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences and 3D structures of both enzymes (Bolam et al., 2007), six regions with distinct differences were identified which we focused on to be exchanged (Figure 2A).

Construction and verification of OleD‐Chimeras by OFREDS Construction and verification of OleD‐Chimeras by OFREDS Construction and verification of OleD‐Chimeras by OFREDS As a first step to construct chimeric enzymes by OFREDS, single replacement of each of the abovementioned six regions was conducted. This produced six first‐generation (G1) chimeric variants, called OleD‐1 to OleD‐6 (Figure 3A). After their expression in E. coli and partial purification by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (Figure S3), their catalytic activity towards NOS was determined. As shown in Figure 3B, OleD‐1 and OleD‐2 resulted in a slight increase of NOS‐G production, by 5.4‐ and 4.8‐folds, respectively, indicating that the swapping of region 1 at the N‐terminal or the deletion of region 2 at the C‐terminal of OleD were both beneficial for site‐specific monoglycosylation of NOS. Higher yields of NOS‐G were obtained with the chimeras OleD‐3 and OleD‐4, demonstrating that the introduction of either region 3 or 4 derived from OleI into OleD contributed to a favourable binding mode of NOS and UDP‐glucose for the enzymic reaction. In contrast, OleD‐5 and OleD‐6 lost the capability of glycosylating NOS, indicating a loss of function when these OleI‐derived sequences were introduced into OleD.

OleD are the production rate of NOS‐G produced by the chimeras and OleD, respectively. In a next step, combinational domain swapping was applied, involving the four favourable regions verified above. This created the second‐generation (G2) OleD chimeras as displayed in Figure 3A. Compared to the G1 products, all G2 chimeras, which contained two or more OleI‐originating domains, displayed increased activity towards NOS, at different levels. In particular OleD‐10 was highly active, resulting in a 38‐fold increase compared to wild‐type OleD (Figure 3B). This was due to combined introduction of regions 1, 2, 3 and 4 from OleI, which were compatible and produced a highly efficient chimeric enzyme. Such a contribution of four positive motifs acting in combination has been seldomly observed in domain‐swapping examples of glycosyltransferases (Krauth et al., 2009; Weis et al., 2008). Although OleD‐10 increased the production rate of NOS‐G from 0.8% (wild‐type OleD) to 30.4%, we needed to further enhance its site‐specific monoglycosylation activity in order to prepare sufficient NOS‐G amounts for in vivo anti‐pathogenic assays.

Establishment of a colorimetric method for glycosyltransferase screening Establishment of a colorimetric method for glycosyltransferase screening Establishment of a colorimetric method for glycosyltransferase screening To produce NOS‐G at higher yields, multiple mutants of chimeric OleD‐10 had to be screened for enhanced monoglycosylation activity, for which the product identification by HPLC was unpractical. Moreover, a reaction system containing crude cell extracts of expressed OleD‐10 mutants excluded the practical utility of existing UGTs screening strategies that depend on purified enzyme, such as a pH indicator assay and a fluorescence‐based assay (Hewitt et al., 2019; Persson & Palcic, 2008; Ryu et al., 2014). To overcome this, we first considered the high‐throughput screening method of a dual GT coupled reaction (DGCR) (Williams et al., 2007) for screening OleD‐10 variants in a colorimetric assay. Unfortunately, the overlap in absorption wavelength and colour between NOS and the indicator product, 2‐chloro‐4‐nitrophenolate, prevented its application. We have previously described that sucrose synthase AtSUS (GenBank accession number OAP16120.1) from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyses the reversible conversion of sucrose and uridine diphosphate (UDP) into UDP‐glucose (UDPG) and reductive fructose (Zhang, Xu, et al., 2020). By coupling with OleD‐10 variants, AtSUS‐generated UDPG could serve as a sugar donor to monoglycosylate NOS for the biosynthesis of NOS‐G. The catalytic activity of an OleD‐10 variant towards NOS was then indirectly determined by colourizing simultaneously produced fructose using DNS reagent (Figure 4). This OleD‐AtSUS colorimetric screening method (OACSM) was used for the screening of OleD‐10 variants. The method not only allowed rapid screening of multiple OleD‐10 variants but was also cost‐effective, as it did not require UDP‐glucose to be added.

Any possible endogenous interference in E. coli BL21(DE3) was considered first, for which a KEGG analysis was carried out according to reported methods (Kanehisa et al., 2017). This identified maltodextrin glucosidase (MalZ) in the sugar metabolic pathway of E. coli BL21(DE3) (Figure S4A) that is able to convert sucrose to fructose and glucose (Figure S4B) (Dippel & Boos, 2005), which would hamper the accuracy of our designed OACSM. To correct for this, the malZ gene was knocked out to create E. coli malZ
–KO in which the endogenous production of fructose was decreased by 91.6% compared with wild‐type E. coli BL21(DE3) (Figure S5A,B). This satisfactory removal of the background fructose synthesis allowed screening of OleD‐10 variants by OACSM after expression in E. coli malZ
–KO. The obtained data (Table S9) demonstrated a wide range of substrate linearity between 0.05 and 0.80 mM of fructose, and a recovery rate of 99.96% with a precision of 0.969 was obtained. The limit of detection (LoD) was 0.041 mM and the limit of quantitation (LoQ) was 0.123 mM. Importantly, the brown colour and A540 indicative of a positive reaction with detectable fructose remained unchanged after 2 h at room temperature (Figure S5B), suggesting that this colorimetric system was suitable for application.

Semi‐rational engineering of chimeric OleD‐10 Semi‐rational engineering of chimeric OleD‐10 Semi‐rational engineering of chimeric OleD‐10 In order to determine the most suitable sites for further optimizing OleD‐10, we first confirmed the catalytic site of the enzyme. In accordance with the described glycosylation mechanism of OleD (Bolam et al., 2007; Gantt et al., 2013), site‐directed mutagenesis (results not shown) confirmed that its catalytic site consists of the dyad H25‐D116, in which H25 directly removes a proton from the hydroxyl of NOS, to nucleophilically attack the active C1 of glucose in the UDP‐sugar (Figure S6A). This is based on the docking complex of NOS and the crystal structure of chimeric OleD‐10 containing UDPG (PDB ID: 7XX4) (Figure S6B). In accordance with a reported example (Xu et al., 2022), we then selected target mutation sites in OleD‐10 for activity enhancement within 4 Å around residue H25; these were S2, I20, A22, H23, G24, V26, N27, P28, W79, D116, T118 and P138 (Figure S7A). The amino acids in the 4 Å range around NOS were also considered: W79, P80, E81, M87, F90, I117, T118, Y120, P138, N139, L140, Y146, E149, V150, M154, A188S, M314 and D335 (Figure S7B). Combining all sites and after removal of duplicate sites and exclusion of catalytic D116, a total of 26 residues in OleD‐10 were used for site‐directed mutagenesis by replacing them with alanine or serine (Figure 5A,B). Increased activity was found for variants I117A and T118A (Figure 5B) which exhibited 1.11 and 1.16 times higher activity, respectively, of NOS‐G production compared to OleD‐10. An absolute loss of activity was observed for mutants N139A, M314A and D335A. This suggests that these five sites are important for the glycosylation of NOS, and amino acid substitution at these sites may dramatically change OleD‐10 structures or substrate‐enzyme interaction modes. We then performed saturation mutagenesis for I117, T118, N139, M314 and D335 to create variants with improved activity towards NOS. In order to determine the most suitable sites for further optimizing OleD‐10, we first confirmed the catalytic site of the enzyme. In accordance with the described glycosylation mechanism of OleD (Bolam et al., 2007; Gantt et al., 2013), site‐directed mutagenesis (results not shown) confirmed that its catalytic site consists of the dyad H25‐D116, in which H25 directly removes a proton from the hydroxyl of NOS, to nucleophilically attack the active C1 of glucose in the UDP‐sugar (Figure S6A).

By application of OACSM, all produced variants were screened and their activity was compared to OleD‐10, and promising candidates were confirmed by HPLC. As shown in Figure 5C,D, the replacement of I117 to A, F, W and S and of T118 to G, K, Q and H, all increased the production rate of NOS‐G by at least 10% and 20%. However, residue substitution of N139, M314 and D335 did not significantly alter activity for monoglycosylation of NOS (data not shown). Subsequently, synergistic effects of I117X1 (X
1 = A, F, W) and T118X2 (X
2 = G, K, Q, H) were explored by combinatorial mutagenesis. The combination I117F/T118G (abbreviated as FG) resulted in the best‐performing OleD‐10 double‐mutant, with a NOS‐G production of 56%, almost 70‐fold higher than wild‐type OleD (Figure 5A,E). The incomplete conversion of NOS to NOS‐G was supposed to be caused by an insoluble form of NOS in the reaction mixture, as a granular deposit was formed over time. For this reason, further enzyme optimization was not performed. The insolubility of NOS in various organic solvents (Xie et al., 2019) also hampered the possibility of constructing a biphasic reaction system using aqueous buffer and an immiscible solvent (Zhang, Bittner, et al., 2022) for FG‐catalysed monoglycosylation. Nevertheless, the produced chimeric FG was sufficiently active to produce NOS‐G amounts required for in vivo tests.

Molecular basis of enhanced glycosylation activity of chimeric OleD variants Molecular basis of enhanced glycosylation activity of chimeric OleD variants Molecular basis of enhanced glycosylation activity of chimeric OleD variants To investigate the molecular basis for the enhanced activity of the engineered OleD‐10 enzyme, first the crystal structure of the protein‐UDPG complex (PDB ID: 7XX4) was solved for the chimeric OleD‐10 protein prior to site‐specific modification. For this, X‐ray crystallography was performed at a resolution of 2.5 Å, characterized by the diffraction refinement and statistical data shown in Table S10. As shown in Figure S8A,B, the chimeric OleD‐10 protein belongs to the conserved GT‐B fold just like wild‐type OleD (Bolam et al., 2007), in which the characteristic β/α/β Rossman fold was composed of the N‐terminal region with six α‐helices and seven β‐strands (M1‐G218 and G290‐A405), the C‐terminal region containing six α‐helices and six β‐strands (D223‐A405) and a flexible loop linking the two regions. When the structural diagrams of OleD and OleD‐10 were superpositioned, it displayed that the overall structure of OleD‐10 is much tighter than that of OleD (Figure S8C). In crystalline OleD‐10 formed in presence of UDPG, the distance of UDPG (determined by the C1 position of the sugar unit) was positioned close to catalytic residue H25, at 6.00 Å distance (Figure S8D). In contrast, the distance between UDPG and catalytic H19 of wild‐type OleD (corresponding to H25 in OleD‐10) was much longer, at 13.61 Å (Figure S8E). This difference in the structure of OleD‐10 would favourably facilitate the SN2‐like nucleophilic attack of de‐protonated 3‐OH of the pyridine group in NOS against the C1 of glucose in UDPG (Bolam et al., 2007; Nidetzky et al., 2018). In addition, we performed a 200 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation (Figure S9A,B), which indicated that the non‐touching state of NOS and UDPG in catalytic OleD (Figure 6A) was probably the main factor resulting in a negligible efficiency to produce NOS‐G by this enzyme, with k

To gain insight into the molecular basis of improved NOS glycosylation activity by OleD‐10 and FG, we modelled the flexible docking of NOS and UDPG with FG, using the OleD‐10 structure as a template, as well as a 200 ns MD simulation of the resulting complex (Figure S9C). The steady‐state conformation of FG was obtained with a distance <3 Å between the 3‐hydroxy‐O of the core pyridine in NOS for SN2‐like transglycosylation (Bolam et al., 2007; Nidetzky et al., 2018) and the NE2 nitrogen of the catalytic residue H25. That distance is much lower than that observed with OleD‐10 (Figure 6C,D), suggesting that the combined substitutions of I117F and T118G had further enhanced the enzyme‐substrate binding affinity. This was confirmed by the kinetic parameters in Table 1, listing the apparent K

 values of 0.52 mM for FG towards NOS and 1.64 mM towards UDP‐glucose. Correspondingly, the apparent K

m
 values for OleD‐10 were both enhanced to 0.72 and 2.93 mM, respectively. In addition, the calculated binding free energies for NOS in OleD‐10 (−145.21 kJ/mol) and in variant FG (−210.99 kJ/mol) were also in line with its improved activity towards NOS.

According to the established root mean square deviation (RMSD), the conformations of the two enzymes OleD‐10 and FG with their NOS and UDPG substrates were stable after 100 ns of MD simulation (Figure S9C). Compared to OleD‐10, the lower RMSD value of variant FG suggested the formation of a more stable complex of enzyme and substrates, which guaranteed a better activity towards NOS with a 2.8‐fold increase in catalytic efficiency (Table 1). Most of the amino acids located around the catalytic pocket in variant FG produced lower root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values than their corresponding equivalents in OleD‐10 (Figure S9D), again indicating the superior binding of substrate in FG that would result in higher reaction rates (Li et al., 2020).

Physicochemical properties and biological activity of NOS‐G Physicochemical properties and biological activity of NOS‐G Physicochemical properties and biological activity of NOS‐G To determine the effect of the glycosylation of NOS on the properties of the compound, the solubility and stability were investigated for a pH range of 2.0 to 7.0. As shown in Figure S10A, NOS‐G displayed a remarkably enhanced solubility in water at all tested pH values compared to NOS. It reached the highest concentration of 596.2 ng/mL at pH 6.0, which was approximately 21‐fold higher than NOS (28.3 ng/mL) at that pH. Both NOS‐G and NOS were stable in acidic solutions for 24 h in the dark (Figure S10B). The shelf‐life of NOS‐G powder was good: storage at −20°C for 12 months resulted in negligible chemical degradation (data not shown). Exposed to light, thermostability of NOS‐G powder was tested at 40°C at which temperature it was quite stable: after 10 days a decrease of only 1.5% was noted, whereas NOS was somewhat less stable, leading to a 4% decrease on day 10 (Figure S10C). Thus, glycosylation had improved physicochemical properties of NOS in terms of stability and solvability, which are important contributors for druggability.

Next, the antibacterial activity of NOS‐G was tested in vitro. As shown in Table 2, in vitro anti‐bacterial activity was detected against strains of MRSA, MRSE, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, with MIC values ranging from 0.0625 to 0.5 μg/mL, which was only slightly higher than the values for NOS, but significantly better than vancomycin. This implied that the 3‐hydroxy group of the core pyridine group of NOS could be modified without loss of antibacterial activity. Lastly, the therapeutic potency of NOS‐G was assessed in an animal model. Mice were infected with MRSA and injected with a single dose of NOS or NOS‐G 1 h post‐infection. Three doses were tested. As shown in Figure 7, administration of NOS or NOS‐G effectively delayed death of the animals. At the lowest dose tested (2.5 mg/kg), the survival rate in the NOS‐G‐treated group was 50% at 20 h post‐infection, which is slightly better than NOS (37.5%) (Figure 7A). A higher therapeutic effect of NOS‐G became apparent at higher dosages (5 and 10 mg/kg): at 20 h, NOS‐G‐treated animals had a survival rate of 62.5%, while it was still 37.5% for the NOS‐treated group (Figure 7B,C). This shows that structural alteration of the 3‐hydroxyl group of the pyridine ring in NOS could bring about positive effects, which might be a potential breakthrough to overcome the inactivity of NOS in vivo in the future.

CONCLUSIONS CONCLUSIONS To identify whether modification of the 3‐hydroxyl group of the core pyridine ring in NOS was feasible, despite its presumed contribution to antibacterial activity of the compound, we glycosylated the site. For this, an enzymatic strategy was designed that allowed site‐specific modification without the formation of byproducts. The starting point was glycosyltransferase OleD that could perform the desired site‐specific glycosylation, albeit with low efficiency. Its activity was subsequently enhanced, first by single domain swapping, then by combining promising domains, and finally by site‐directed mutagenesis, again singly and in combination. The procedures were enabled by use of a semi‐high‐throughput screening method for activity. The resulting variant FG exhibiting a 70‐fold improvement in the biosynthetic activity of NOS‐G compared to OleD. This increased activity was due to a tighter structure of FG when interacting with UDPG and NOS. The shorter distance (<3 Å) of the substrate to H25 in the catalytic site to the sugar most likely contributed to a more efficient SN2‐type transglycosylation. The glycosylation of NOS improved its solubility and stability and its antibacterial activity was conserved. In addition, NOS‐G possessed a promising in vivo protective effect towards MRSA infection in mice. We conclude that the 3‐hydroxypyridine ring of NOS is a suitable target for modification to create novel NOS‐derived analogues with a better druggability in the future.
