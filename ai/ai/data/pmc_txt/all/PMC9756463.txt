This region is inhabited by specifically adapted microorganisms that produce various unique secondary metabolites (e.g. pigments) enabling their survival under the harsh environmental conditions. It was already shown that these natural, biologically active molecules may find application in various fields of biotechnology. Results Results In this study, a cold-active brown-pigment-producing Pseudomonas sp. ANT_H4 strain was characterized. In-depth genomic analysis combined with the application of a fosmid expression system revealed two different pathways of melanin-like compounds biosynthesis by the ANT_H4 strain. The chromatographic behavior and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic analyses allowed for the identification of the extracted melanin-like compound as a pyomelanin. Furthermore, optimization of the production and thorough functional analyses of the pyomelanin were performed to test its usability in biotechnology. It was confirmed that ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin increases the sun protection factor, enables scavenging of free radicals, and interacts with the iron from minerals. Moreover, it was shown for the first time that pyomelanin exhibits priming properties toward Calendula officinalis hairy roots in in vitro cultures.

Keywords Background Background Antarctica is one of the most extreme regions on Earth, characterized by very low temperatures, strong ultra-violet (UV) radiation, and sunlight and nutrient deficiency [1]. However, even harsh polar environments are inhabited by highly specialized microorganisms that have developed a number of adaptive traits necessary for their survival [2]. These include the synthesis of various secondary metabolites, e.g., biosurfactants and siderophores, which help to increase the availability of nutrients and minerals [3] or the synthesis of pigments (carotenoids and melanins) responsible for protection against UV radiation [4, 5].

An important group of microorganisms often isolated from the Antarctic regions is bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas [6]. These rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacteria are valued in biotechnology due to their high metabolic potential for the production of several valuable secondary metabolites [7]. Among many known compounds, pseudomonads produce bioactive pigments classified as phenazines (pyocyanin and pyorubrin), siderophores (pyoverdine, fluorescein), and melanins (pyomelanin) [8]. While much is known about the basic functions of the above-mentioned secondary metabolites, the potential of melanins is still not fully exploited.

While much is known about the basic functions of the above-mentioned secondary metabolites, the potential of melanins is still not fully exploited. Melanins are brown-black polymers produced by organisms mainly to protect against UV radiation [9]. These bioactive polymers are classified according to the chemical precursors used in their biosynthesis, being eumelanin, pheomelanin, neuromelanin, allomelanin, and pyomelanin, the latter of which is also classified as a form of allomelanin [10, 11]. Pyomelanin originates from the catabolism of L-tyrosine or L-phenylalanine which, due to further transformation by 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (Hpd), forms homogentisic acid (HGA). HGA is the substrate of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HmgA). However, overexpression of Hpd or repression of HmgA leads to accumulation of HGA and causes its secretion from the cell where it undergoes oxidation to benzoquinoneacetic acid and self-polymerization into pyomelanin [10, 12]. Moreover, due to the heterogenous nature of the polymer [13] and under certain circumstances, additional substrates may appear during its formation as a consequence of, e.g., quinone oxidoreductases activity [14–16].

The chemical structure of pyomelanin is responsible for numerous biological properties and functions such as protection from light and oxidative stress, energy transduction as well as chelation and reduction of metal ions, e.g., Fe3+ [10, 17]. It has been suggested that pyomelanins may contribute to increasing the availability of certain elements in minerals for the microorganisms [9, 10, 17]. They can, therefore, play a supporting role for bacterial siderophores through increasing iron bioavailability [18]. On the other hand, since melanins produced by certain plant pathogens are virulence factors [19], these compounds, as elicitors, can stimulate defense responses in plants [20]. Checking whether a certain compound can be used as a potential elicitation agent very often involves examining its effect on the production of general and specialized metabolites in native plants or their in vitro cultures. The results are often manifested in the modified proportions of both types of metabolites [21]. In summary, these data confirm that melanins have considerable biotechnological potential.

In-depth genomic analyses of the Pseudomonas sp. ANT_H4 strain revealed its considerable metabolic potential. Besides the set of genes belonging to the primary metabolism, e.g., glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the citrate cycle, the pentose phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff pathways, the ANT_H4 strain possesses complete metabolic pathways of dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification as well as a pathway of assimilatory sulfate reduction. These findings suggest it has high adaptation to surviving under anaerobic conditions, which is also characteristic of many other known pseudomonads [33–35]. Moreover, in the ANT_H4 genome, there are genes encoding enzymes responsible for biosynthesis and utilization of polyhydroxyalkanoates (i.e., polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthases (EC:2.3.1.-) (GenBank accession numbers: KAA0949046, KAA0949048) and poly (3-hydroxyalkanoate) depolymerase (EC:3.1.1.75) (GenBank accession number: KAA0949047)), as well as enzymes responsible for the production of surface-active rhamnolipids (i.e., RhlA) (GenBank accession number: KAA0950251), RmlABCD (GenBank accession numbers: KAA0945161, KAA0943063, KAA0948219, KAA0945160, KAA0945162, and KAA0945163) – metabolites crucial for survival under nutrient deficiency, permanent cold, and freezing conditions [36, 37]. Furthermore, in the ANT_H4 genome there are also gene clusters encoding for the synthesis of two types of siderophores, being xanthoferrin – PvsABCDE (GenBank accession numbers: KAA0945766, FQ182_15965 (locus; frameshifted), KAA0945767, KAA0945768, KAA0945769) and pyoverdine –PvdAEHLMOPQSY (GenBank accession numbers: KAA0947683, KAA0947675, KAA0944452, KAA0944446, KAA0947677, KAA0947676, KAA0947679, KAA0945967, KAA0944444, and KAA0944443), necessary in nutrient-deficient environments and acting as iron chelators. In-depth genomic analyses of the Pseudomonas sp. ANT_H4 strain revealed its considerable metabolic potential. Besides the set of genes belonging to the primary metabolism, e.g., glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the citrate cycle, the pentose phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff pathways, the ANT_H4 strain possesses complete metabolic pathways of dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification as well as a pathway of assimilatory sulfate reduction. These findings suggest it has high adaptation to surviving under anaerobic conditions, which is also characteristic of many other known pseudomonads [33–35].

As mentioned above, Pseudomonas sp. ANT_H4 produces a brown-black pigment that was identified as pyomelanin. Based on the genomic analysis, it was shown that ANT_H4 possesses a known and common pathway of tyrosine degradation to homogentisic acid, meaning it encodes tyrosine aminotransferase (EC:2.6.1.5) (GenBank accession number: KAA0943952) and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (EC:1.13.11.27) (GenBank accession number: KAA0943679). The homogentisic acid may be then used as a starting material for pyomelanin production. However, in the genome, an enzyme involved in homogentisic acid degradation (homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (EC:1.13.11.5) (GenBank accession number: KAA0946993) is also encoded. Nevertheless, the presence of quinone oxidoreductases (EC:1.6.5.5) (GenBank accession numbers: KAA0947416, KAA0946026, KAA0945409), which detoxify benzoquinones by reducing them into hydroquinones, may interrupt proper homogentisic acid degradation, which manifests in pyomelanin production [38–40].

To identify genes directly responsible for the production of pyomelanin, functional analysis using a fosmid-based expression system was applied [41]. Four fosmid clones displaying the capacity of synthesizing pyomelanin were further sequenced. The analysis of these sequencing results revealed a common core set of 27 genes (Fig. 4, Table 2). Amongst the identified enzymes, we found one gene function that might be directly involved in the melanin-overproducing phenotype: quinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.5.5). The gene encoding for this enzyme was amplified by PCR, subcloned into plasmid pBluescript II SK, and transformed into E. coli TG1 and MPO554. However, the pyomelanin production phenotype was not observed in any of the tested hosts, which may indicate that either the introduced gene is inactive, not involved in pyomelanin production, or not sufficient for pyomelanin overproduction. Taking into account that all fosmids in pyomelanin-producing strains contained a set of common genes we assume that this is not a single-gene-generated phenotype, but rather a consequence of the action of several genetic determinants creating a unique cluster.Fig. 4A comparison of the fosmid-encoded core proteome with other bacterial genomes. The latter were selected based on the presence of at least 10 homologous proteins encoded within a 50-kb-range of DNA sequence. From these, only homologous regions were extracted based on coordinates present in brackets below the accession number of a particular contig. They were aligned with a clinker tool, where each protein coding sequence is represented as a rectangle arrow.

We further explored the presence and co-location of genes encoding for proteins homologous to proteins encoded by the core of fosmids giving the desired phenotype. After a search of the NCBI nr database, we observed that there were 64 contigs carrying at least 10 out of 23 homologous genes and 34 of them carried these genes within a 50-kb-range fragment of DNA (Fig. 4). Besides the ANT_H4 contig (accession number VOBG01000010), we identified the same gene cluster in another strain isolated from the same location – Pseudomonas sp. ANT_H12B (VOBH01000017).

The ability of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin to absorb UV light contributes to direct protection from sunlight. As a non-cytotoxic compound [15, 25, 42], pyomelanin could be an excellent additive to enhance the power of sunscreens. In order to test that hypothesis, the sun protection factor (SPF) of three commercial sunscreens was determined empirically: The stated SPFs were 5, 15, and 25, while the results of the analyses revealed values of 5.09 ± 0.03, 13.41 ± 0.35, and 25.10 ± 0.13, respectively. Addition of pyomelanin to each of these sunscreens resulted in an increase of SPF to: (i) 7.79 ± 0.04, 15.88 ± 0.43, 27.48 ± 0.12 when pyomelanin in final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL was added, and (ii) 6.41 ± 0.14, 14.65 ± 0.19, 25.35 ± 0.17 when pyomelanin in final concentration of 0.01 mg/mL was added [25, 43, 44]. The effect of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin is consistent with the results of other researchers testing the SPF changes of sunscreen [25, 42, 45]. However, currently, only two melanin-like compounds are used in cosmetics; catechol melanin from black olive fruits (Laboratoires Biocyte, France), and "bio-melanin" in anti-UV lotions (Baar Products, PA, USA). So far, there is no mention of the use of pyomelanin, mainly due to the lack of optimization of its production efficiency [42].

UV radiation (especially UVA) reaching the skin leads to the generation of free radicals that oxidize proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids [46]. In the case of pyomelanin, the ability to scavenge free radicals is its primary feature [24, 47]. In order to test the antioxidant capacity of the ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin, the free-radical scavenging effect was tested on a 0.1 mM DPPH solution (used as a free radical). The IC50 value (antioxidant concentration required for quenching 50% of the initial DPPH) was established at a concentration of ~ 0.75 mg/mL pyomelanin, which quenched maximally 60% of the DPPH at a concentration of 2 mg/mL (Fig. 5). This is in line with the results of previous studies [15, 17, 45].Fig. 5The ability of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin to scavenge DPPH free radicals and chelate iron CAS reagent.

Iron binding properties Iron binding properties Iron binding properties Iron binding properties One of the features of pyomelanin is its ability to interact with iron-containing particles. The presence of quinones in the polymer structure, as well as the specific structure resembling siderophores in certain configurations, enables both the binding and reduction (Fe3+ to Fe2+) of iron [10, 48]. For example, pyomelanin produced by Legionella pneumophila conferred a ferric reductase activity and thus played an important role in iron uptake [18, 30, 49]. This is a feature that leads to an increase in iron bioavailability and thus positively impacts bacterial fitness. The iron-binding properties of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin were performed against the CAS-HDTMA-iron complex, in which iron is relatively weakly bonded [50]. The iron chelation capacity of pyomelanin was measured spectrophotometrically at OD630. The results were similar to deferoxamine mesylate siderophore at a concentration of 0.025 mM and reached its maximum at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Therefore, it suggests the participation of the tested compound in increasing the availability of iron in the environment, especially as the structure of the pyomelanin and its iron binding mechanism are similar to humic acids, commonly used in bio-fertilizers for plants [51–54].

Many iron chelators also exhibit antioxidant properties [55]. It was shown that the iron-binding and free-radical scavenging properties of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin correlated and reached their maximum at a concentration of 2 mg/mL of pyomelanin (Fig. 5). This result is very important according to the iron-reduction properties of the investigated compound, which can lead to Fenton's reaction, responsible for the generation of free radicals [54, 56].

The batching experiment revealed increased iron retention in the presence of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin. Both tested concentrations, i.e., 0.1 and 0.01 mg/mL significantly reduced the loss of iron after 1, 24, and 48 h of batching minerals. The results after 48 h were similar for both pyomelanin concentrations and showed over 80-fold increased hematite iron retention compared to the control. In the case of pyrite, an increased (over 60-fold) retention was observed with the use of a higher (0.1 mg/mL) concentration of pyomelanin (Table 3). The results are very promising in light of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin applicability. Due to the specific chemical structure of pyomelanin, it participates in iron redox processes, but we also hypothesize that the polymer may adhere to the surface of minerals and stabilize them by creating a protective layer.Table 3The amount of iron released (µg/mL) from hematite and pyrite after treatment with pyomelanin at two concentrations and deionized water (ddH2O; control)MineralTime [h]ControlPyomelaninddH2O ± concentration 0.1 mg/mL ± concentration 0.01 mg/mL ± Hematite(Fe2O3)11.8780.0870.0420.0050.0440.001241.4580.0360.0280.0030.0300.002481.3860.0290.0160.0050.0160.004Pyrite(FeS2)11.1740.1340.0500.0050.0490.000240.8240.0670.0290.0080.0220.008480.5710.0380.0090.0040.0160.003 The batching experiment revealed increased iron retention in the presence of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin.

Due to the specific chemical structure of pyomelanin, it participates in iron redox processes, but we also hypothesize that the polymer may adhere to the surface of minerals and stabilize them by creating a protective layer.Table 3The amount of iron released (µg/mL) from hematite and pyrite after treatment with pyomelanin at two concentrations and deionized water (ddH2O; control)MineralTime [h]ControlPyomelaninddH2O ± concentration 0.1 mg/mL ± concentration 0.01 mg/mL ± Hematite(Fe2O3)11.8780.0870.0420.0050.0440.001241.4580.0360.0280.0030.0300.002481.3860.0290.0160.0050.0160.004Pyrite(FeS2)11.1740.1340.0500.0050.0490.000240.8240.0670.0290.0080.0220.008480.5710.0380.0090.0040.0160.003 The batching experiment revealed increased iron retention in the presence of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin. Both tested concentrations, i.e., 0.1 and 0.01 mg/mL significantly reduced the loss of iron after 1, 24, and 48 h of batching minerals. The results after 48 h were similar for both pyomelanin concentrations and showed over 80-fold increased hematite iron retention compared to the control. In the case of pyrite, an increased (over 60-fold) retention was observed with the use of a higher (0.1 mg/mL) concentration of pyomelanin (Table 3).

Hairy roots elicitation Hairy roots elicitation Hairy roots elicitation Hairy roots elicitation Melanin-like compounds are often identified among many fungal plant pathogens as their virulence factors protecting non-specifically against host defense mechanisms. The pathogen-free molecules themselves are not harmful to plants, however, they are recognized by them as a potential threat [47]. This initiates a cascade of biochemical processes leading to modifications of biosynthetic pathways resulting in different proportions of plant general and specialized metabolites, and thus to a preventive enhancement of the systemic defense response [21].

Sterols are considered to be plant general metabolites as they build cell membranes and are in charge of maintaining the fluidity and permeability of these structures. Phytosterols also play a role in adaptation to many stress (mostly abiotic) conditions [57]. Pentacyclic triterpenoids are plant specialized metabolites that take part in defense strategies against herbivores and pathogens [58]. During stressful conditions as well as upon elicitation, biosynthesis pathways of sterols and pentacyclic triterpenoids may be competitive due to the common precursor of both groups of compounds, i.e., squalene [21]. However, some factors may stimulate both pathways in parallel, showing evidence that plants’ defense strategies are combined and factor-dependent.

The sterol fraction obtained from diethyl ether extracts was composed of a group of typical sterols, namely campesterol, cholesterol, isofucosterol, sitosterol, and the predominating stigmasterol. One steroid ketone, tremulone, and one biosynthetic precursor, 24-methylenecycloartanol, were also identified in this fraction (Additional file 1: Table S1). The presence of pyomelanin in the culture medium caused a significant increase in steroid biosynthesis; the total content of these compounds in pyomelanin-elicited hairy roots was approximately 58% and 24% higher than in the control roots after 7 and 14 days, respectively (Fig. 6, Additional file 1: Table S2).Fig. 6The content of steroids and triterpenoid alcohols in hairy root tissue.

The contents of sterol glycosides were similar in the control and elicited samples. After seven days of incubation, the number of sterols slightly increased (13%) in the elicited samples, however, after 14 days it decreased (22%) in comparison with control. The modifications in the ratio of conjugated to free forms of sterols are often considered a major key to modulating the membrane order and membrane biophysical properties. The changes in the content of sterol glycosides are often observed during plant stress reactions due to their influence on such plant membrane properties as fluidity and permeability. These changes can also influence the activity of some membrane-bound enzymes as well as proton pumps, which can lead to further modifications of various metabolic pathways [59].Fig. 7The content of sterol glycosides in hairy root tissue.

Simultaneously, the content of the oleanolic acid precursor, triterpenoid alcohol β-amyrin, increased almost tenfold after 14 days of elicitation (Additional file 1: Table S2). The number of oleanolic acid saponins released into the medium was also higher in pyomelanin-treated samples, but the differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 9A, Additional file 1: Table S5). At the same time, the content of oleanolic acid saponins accumulated in the hairy roots tissue of the elicited samples was around 2.7- and 2.9-fold lower as compared with the control after 7 and 14 days, respectively (Fig. 9B, Additional file 1: Table S6). This might be explained by the increased release to the medium, however, the observed enhanced saponin secretion does not fully compensate for the decrease in their accumulation in root tissue occurring after elicitation. Therefore, it seems that it is the free oleanolic acid, and not its saponins, that plays the main role in Calendula officinalis Linnaeus hairy roots defense strategy against potential virulence factors.Fig. 8Free oleanolic acid produced by hairy root tissue.

However, such a high boost to the synthesis of free oleanolic acid as demonstrated in the present study (a more than 90-fold increase after elicitation with ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin) is observed for the first time and has never been reported previously. This result indicates that ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin elicitation is particularly effective in the stimulation of biosynthesis of triterpenoids occurring in a free, and not glycosidic, form. Such specificity in the modulation of the triterpenoid biosynthetic pathway seems to be a rather unique feature of the applied elicitor, and it might be of particular importance for the potential enhancement of biosynthesis of other bioactive triterpenoids.

The obtained results point to the possibility of the application of received pyomelanin in agrotechnics, e.g., as a potential plant priming agent. However, the use of this type of elicitor still requires additional studies of native plants as well as on a larger scale.

Conclusions Conclusions Nowadays the search for natural, biologically active molecules is highly needed. Bioprospection of microorganisms adapted to extreme environmental conditions offers great opportunities for finding new biotechnological solutions. The selection of the Antarctic Pseudomonas sp. ANT_H4 strain that produce pyomelanin into the environment, as well as establishing its efficient overproduction using the fosmid expression system, made it possible considering the applicability of extracted biopolymer. Besides the basic, confirmed properties of ANT_H4-derived pyomelanin, such as sun and free radical protection and interaction with iron ions, we revealed its priming abilities to in vitro hairy root cultures. These interesting results requires further research on native plants in their natural environment and thus, subsequent studies will be directed into development of novel and sustainable agrotechnical solutions based on pyomelanin.

Quantification of melanin-like compounds Quantification of melanin-like compounds Quantification of melanin-like compounds The ANT_H4 strain was cultivated overnight in lysogeny broth (LB) medium at 18 °C with rotary shaking set to 3 RCF. Cultures were then centrifuged (4000 RCF for 5 min) and washed three times with 0.85% saline solution. Next, bacteria were added in triplicate to the fresh LB medium supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) L-tyrosine and cultivated at 18 °C with rotary shaking set to 3 RCF. The initial optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was 0.1. The idiophase was established after 5 days of cultivation (confirmed by the number of colony-forming units (CFU) counted after two consecutive days) and the experiment was continued up to day 10 to maximize metabolite production. Bacteria were then centrifuged (4000 RCF for 5 min) and the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 400 nm [30]. A standard curve was prepared with polymerized homogentisic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) while the LB medium was a blank. Purification of the metabolite followed from the bacterial-free supernatant which was acidified with HCl solution to pH 2 and left overnight for melanin precipitation. In the next step, the residue was washed three times with ddH2O and ethanol. To reduce runaway esterification reactions, the metabolite was dried out of the alcohol. To dissolve the compound, the precipitate was suspended in ddH2O at pH 11 (NaOH solution). For the majority of experiments, the pH was adjusted to 7, which did not affect the solubility of the compounds. In order to remove the salt, the resuspended metabolite was then dialyzed in 10 kDa dialysis tubing for 24 h against water [15, 30].

Bacteria were then centrifuged (4000 RCF for 5 min) and the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 400 nm [30]. A standard curve was prepared with polymerized homogentisic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) while the LB medium was a blank. Purification of the metabolite followed from the bacterial-free supernatant which was acidified with HCl solution to pH 2 and left overnight for melanin precipitation. In the next step, the residue was washed three times with ddH2O and ethanol. To reduce runaway esterification reactions, the metabolite was dried out of the alcohol. To dissolve the compound, the precipitate was suspended in ddH2O at pH 11 (NaOH solution). For the majority of experiments, the pH was adjusted to 7, which did not affect the solubility of the compounds. In order to remove the salt, the resuspended metabolite was then dialyzed in 10 kDa dialysis tubing for 24 h against water [15, 30].
