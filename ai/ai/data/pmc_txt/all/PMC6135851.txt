Streptomyces coelicolor is a Gram-positive microorganism often used as a model of physiological and morphological differentiation in streptomycetes, prolific producers of secondary metabolites with important biological activities. In the present study, we analysed Streptomyces coelicolor growth and differentiation in the presence of the hypo-methylating agent 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) in order to investigate whether cytosine methylation has a role in differentiation. We found that cytosine demethylation caused a delay in spore germination, aerial mycelium development, sporulation, as well as a massive impairment of actinorhodin production. Thus, we searched for putative DNA methyltransferase genes in the genome and constructed a mutant of the SCO1731 gene. The analysis of the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strain demonstrated that inactivation of SCO1731 leads to a strong decrease of cytosine methylation and almost to the same phenotype obtained after 5-aza-dC treatment. Altogether, our data demonstrate that cytosine methylation influences morphological differentiation and actinorhodin production in S. coelicolor and expand our knowledge on this model bacterial system. Introduction Introduction Base methylation is a DNA modification present in all kingdoms of life, including bacteria. The methylation of cytosines is an important epigenetic mark, well known in higher eukaryotes to control transcriptional regulation that can cause repression or activation of gene expression. The correct inheritance of epigenetic patterns is crucial to cell processes while atypical DNA methylation is linked to numerous diseases, disorders and abnormalities1,2. DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1) and UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains) are recognized as the main players in the preservation of DNA methylation in mammals.

DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1) and UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains) are recognized as the main players in the preservation of DNA methylation in mammals. In bacteria the majority of DNA methyltransferases described are part of restriction-modification (RM) systems. A RM system consists of a restriction endonuclease and a DNA (adenine or cytosine) methyltransferase. Usually, base methylation protects host DNA from DNA cleavage by the associated endonuclease. ‘Orphan’ DNA methyltransferase genes can be found in many bacterial genomes and probably derive from ancestral RM systems that lost the cognate restriction enzyme. Additional roles in regulating several important cellular processes, such as initiation of DNA replication, DNA repair and gene regulation, were proposed for bacterial adenine methyltransferases3–8. The most famous examples are the adenine DNA methyltransferases Dam and CcrM. In Escherichia coli Dam is important for gene expression as well as other cellular processes, like DNA replication initiation and DNA repair9–11. In Caulobacter crescentus and other Alphaproteobacteria CcrM is essential to regulate gene expression and controls more than 10% of the genes necessary for its cell cycle progression12. Recently, roles in regulating gene expression were also given to orphan cytosine methyltransferases of Helicobacter pylori and E. coli. In H. pylori an orphan cytosine methyltransferase influences the expression of genes involved in motility, adhesion, and virulence13. In E. coli, the Dcm cytosine methyltransferase controls the expression of two ribosomal protein genes, the drug resistance transporter gene sugE at early stationary phase10,14,15 and the expression of genes associated with stationary phase16.

They are nucleoside analogs that are converted intracellularly to the corresponding 5′-triphosphates upon cell entry; 5-azaC is incorporated into both RNA and DNA, whereas 5-aza-dC only into DNA18–22. When these analogues are incorporated, cytosine-5 DNA-dependent cytosine methyltransferases are locked on the DNA and inhibited with the consequence of decreased 5-methylcytosines in newly replicated DNA20,21. Recently, 5-azaC use was applied to E. coli where it was found to modulate transcriptome23. 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) are cytosine DNA methylation inhibitors routinely used to demethylate DNA in a variety of eukaryotes to assess the consequences of cytosine DNA methylation loss17,18.

They are industrially very important because they produce two thirds of all clinically relevant secondary metabolites24. Streptomyces coelicolor A(3)2 strain M145 is the best-known species of the Streptomyces genus at both genetic and molecular level25–27 and it has long been considered as the model streptomycete for studying physiological (antibiotic production) and morphological differentiation. S. coelicolor A(3)2 M145 produces three well characterised antibiotics (actinorhodin, blue pigment, Act; undecylprodigiosin, red pigment, Red; calcium-dependent lipopeptide antibiotic, CDA), and has been described to encode for up to 30 additional secondary metabolites28. S. coelicolor M145 exhibits a complex developmental cycle that includes sporulation and developmentally associated programmed cell death29,30. In a solid culture (i.e. GYM) five different cell types are sequentially produced: the unigenomic spores, the first mycelium (MI), the second mycelium (MII), aerial cells and sporulating cells. After spore germination, a viable vegetative mycelium grows on the surface and within the agar matrix forming the first compartmentalized mycelium that undergoes a highly ordered PCD. The remaining viable segments of these hyphae enlarge and form the second multinucleated mycelium MII that comprises (i) the MII substrate that grows within the agar matrix, (ii) the aerial MII characterized by hydrophobic layers and (iii) the sporulating MII, which undergoes a second round of PCD followed by spore formation. S. coelicolor life cycle is regulated at different levels by extracellular signals and quorum sensing-related factors, multiple master regulators, and biochemical pathways, such as bald, white and sky27,31,32, but little is known regarding the effect of DNA methylation controlling differentiation.

S. coelicolor M145 has a stringent type IV restriction-modification system that cleaves exogenous methylated DNA, and for its successful transformation it is first necessary to demethylate DNA constructs in a dam−
dcm− mutant strain of E. coli33. Recently, an endonuclease that binds to 5-methyl-cytosine containing DNA in all sequence contexts was characterized34. Years ago, the role of DNA methyltransferases in Streptomyces antibioticus and S. coelicolor was investigated by treating the cultures with demethylating agents and it was found that methylation could influence development and differentiation35–37.

We found that DNA cytosine methylation is modulated during development and that demethylation impairs morphological differentiation and actinorhodin production. Thus, we searched for DNA methyltransferase genes in the genome and constructed a mutant in a putative DNA methyltransferase gene. Our data showed that in the SCO1731::Tn5062 strain, methylation levels decreased and growth and differentiation were delayed, similarly to the effects caused by the treatment of S. coelicolor M145 with the demethylating agent.

S. coelicolor M145, S. griseus and S. avermitilis degrade exogenous methylated DNA, while S. lividans does not38,39. S. lividans 1326 and S. coelicolor M145 are different in accepting methylated DNA, but they have a very similar genome and a similar development40. Despite of that, DNA cytosine methylation during development is comparable in all the Streptomyces species in all the growth phases analyzed (higher at the MI stage), indicating that (i) the cytosine methylation is conserved in the Streptomycetaceae family, (ii) has a broader role on Streptomyces differentiation and (iii) is not only a tag to recognize and degrade exogenous DNA.

In liquid sucrose-free R5A cultures, the addition of 5-aza-dC decreased growth rate (Fig. 3a) and delayed spore germination; indeed, ungerminated spores were still present at 20 h in the treated culture, as visualized by CLSM (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the 5-aza-dC treated liquid culture, undecylprodigiosin production started later in the treated culture, but after 100 h, the yields were similar (Fig. 3b), while actinorhodin production was 4-fold lower and started later compared to the untreated culture (Fig. 3c).Figure 3Effect of 5-aza-dC treatment in sucrose-free liquid R5A cultures.

Construction of a mutant in the putative DNA methyltransferase SCO1731 gene Construction of a mutant in the putative DNA methyltransferase SCO1731 gene Construction of a mutant in the putative DNA methyltransferase SCO1731 gene Bioinformatics analysis revealed that S. coelicolor M145 encodes 38 putative DNA methyltransferases (Table 1). The expression profile of these putative DNA methyltransferases was compared to the transcriptomic data, previously obtained using the same growth media29. This search revealed that SCO1731 displayed the highest transcription level among the putative methyltransferase genes in MI and has orthologs in S. lividans 1326 genome (100% identity), S. avermitilis ATCC 31267 (79%) and S. griseus strain NBRC 102592 (64%).Table 1List of putative methyltransferases annotated in S. coelicolor genome (StrepDB - The Streptomyces Annotation Server).Putative methyltransferaseLog 2 Ratio MII24h/MIExpression phase

Conversely, the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant had a slight effect on cytosine methylation after 55 h of growth (MII) (Supplementary Fig. S2). Actinorhodin (blue pigment) was not observed in the SCO1731 mutant strain in liquid sucrose-free R5A even after 96 h of growth (Fig. 5), revealing that the mutant is impaired in actinorhodin production.

A complemented strain harboring a copy of the SCO1731 ORF and its upstream region large enough to include the promoter region, was generated. In the SCO1731_compl strain, the methylation levels were restored to 70% of the wild-type methylation level (Fig. 4b), the morphological development (aerial mycelium and sporulation) was fully restored (Fig. 6), and actinorhodin production was reestablished at 96 h, but not at 72 h (Fig. 5). The control strain, containing a copy of the empty integrative vector used for complementation (S. coelicolor + pNG3), showed a normal antibiotic production profile (Fig. 5) and development (Fig. 6), excluding an effect of pNG3 integration on the phenotypes observed in the SCO1731_compl strain.

Discussion Discussion Cytosine and adenine methylation are epigenetic mechanisms to control gene expression in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, respectively. While adenine methylation has been largely studied in many bacterial systems and it was shown to influence crucial vital processes, such as bacterial cell cycle, only a few studies have so far been published on cytosine methylation in bacteria, mostly in Escherichia coli4,5,16,23. Years ago, some attempts to find a role for DNA methyltransferases in S. antibioticus and S. coelicolor were reported. These studies applied different compounds known to block cytosine methylation (e.g. 5-azacytidine and sinefungin), but no clear role for cytosine methylation was established35–37. Here, we demonstrate that methylation levels are modulated throughout the growth cycle in both, solid and liquid media. This result is of particular interest, since S. coelicolor transformation efficiency depends on the methylation status of exogenous DNA38–40. We also demonstrate that the hypo-methylating agent 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) causes a delay in spore germination, aerial mycelium differentiation and sporulation in solid medium and affects growth and spore germination in liquid medium; in addition, actinorhodin production is massively impaired in both solid and liquid media; differently, undecylprodigiosin production is retarded, but the yields in the treated cultures are similar to the untreated ones. Unfortunately, our results cannot be compared to previous reports using hypo-methylating agents in Streptomyces35–37, since 5-azacytidine is incorporated into both DNA and RNA, and sinefungin is an inhibitor of SAM-dependent cytosine and adenine methyltransferase, while in our experiments we used 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine that is only incorporated in DNA. Thus, the effect we noticed is essentially due to cytosine methylation in the genome.

Thus, the effect we noticed is essentially due to cytosine methylation in the genome. We demonstrate that SCO1731 codes for a cytosine methyltransferase involved in the cytosine methylation accompanying Streptomyces differentiation. In the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strain, cytosine methylation was reduced to 22% compared to the parental strain during the MI stage. Our results cannot rule out that other methyltransferases may be responsible for residual methylation nor that other methyltransferases may be expressed following SCO1731 activation in a cascade manner. In fact, 38 genes coding for putative methyltransferases are present in S. coelicolor genome, making this a reasonable hypothesis. Among them, SCO1731 was transcribed in MI at higher levels, when cytosine methylation is higher than in other growth stages both in liquid and solid medium. Moreover, the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant shows the same phenotype observed in the 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treated cultures regarding the effect on actinorhodin production, aerial mycelium differentiation and sporulation, that resulted impaired in the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant and the 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treated cultures; differently, the delay observed in undecylprodigiosin production, spore germination and growth in the 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treated cultures was not observed in the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant. This further indicates that SCO1731 is not the only methyltransferase participating in the regulation of Streptomyces development. Interestingly, the complemented mutant strain restored partially the methylation levels to 70% and if on the one hand this was sufficient to restore the correct morphological development, on the other one said methylation level was not sufficient to re-establish the onset of the actinorhodin production, further supporting that some other cellular events do occur. This kind of multilevel regulation would be not far from other bacterial systems, better investigated for influence of DNA methylation on gene expression. For instance, in C. crescentus many genes are controlled by the CcrM methyltransferase and are also co-regulated by other global cell cycle regulators, demonstrating extensive cross talk between DNA adenine methylation and the complex regulatory network governing cell cycle progression12.

For instance, in C. crescentus many genes are controlled by the CcrM methyltransferase and are also co-regulated by other global cell cycle regulators, demonstrating extensive cross talk between DNA adenine methylation and the complex regulatory network governing cell cycle progression12. Given that S. coelicolor undergoes a complex life cycle with two programmed cell death events, we hypothesized that the hypermethylation of genomic DNA in MI could be a signal that activates DNA cleavage in some cells leading to cell death and allowing a controlled life cycle. In E. coli, it was demonstrated that cell death occurs upon an induced cytosine hypermethylation of the genome42–44. Even if this were the case, it would still be difficult to explain how adjacent cells perceive different stimuli and follow different fates29. If this hypothesis were correct, PCD and differentiation of S. coelicolor would have to be blocked after 5-aza-dC treatment and in the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strain, and this is not the case. Notwithstanding, it is possible that 5-aza-dC effect is temporary and that other methyltransferases or pathways are activated in the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strain. An alternative hypothesis about the biological role of cytosine methylation, is that it influences gene expression, as it occurs in other systems14–16,23,45. Methylation of cytosines in eukaryotic promoters leads to repression of transcription and to an activation when it affects gene bodies45. In E. coli the absence of the dcm gene leads to a differential expression of 510 genes, i.e. two ribosomal protein genes and the drug resistance transporter gene sugE, at stationary phase14–16. Future work will be addressed to identifying SCO1731 target genes and to comparing the methylome of S. coelicolor parental and the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant strains.

Overall, this is the first report that correlates DNA cytosine methylation with differentiation in S. coelicolor and attributes a DNA methyltransferase function to the SCO1731 gene. Our results show that both, the treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine as well as the inactivation of the SCO1731 gene, result in a strong impairment in morphological differentiation (delay in aerial mycelium and sporulation) and an impediment in actinorhodin production. Our results reveal, for the first time, that epigenetics, through methylation of cytosines, control morpho-physiological differentiation in S. coelicolor unveiling new levels of complexity of gene expression and regulation in this microorganism.

Dot Blot assay Dot Blot assay Dot Blot assay Genomic DNAs were extracted by salting out procedures, as described in Lo Grasso et al.48. Dot blot assay was performed following the protocol described in Caracappa et al.49. Briefly, genomic DNA was denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, spotted on nitrocellulose filter (Hybond ECL, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and fixed by UV (2 cycles at 700 J). The spotted DNA was detected by staining the filter with 0.02% (w/v) methylene blue in 0.3 mol/L sodium acetate (pH 5.2). After removal of the staining solution, the methylated cytosines were detected using the anti-5-methylcytosine mouse antibody (Calbiochem) and the secondary goat anti-mouse IgG-H&L chain specific peroxidase conjugate (Calbiochem). The images were taken using Chemidoc (Chemi Hi sensitivity) and SuperSignal®West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Life Technologies). Spots of the same area were manually labelled and quantified by Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS System Biorad. Percentage of methylation level was reported as arbitrary units per mm2 (AU/mm2). The experiments were performed at least twice and in triplicate. Genomic DNAs were extracted by salting out procedures, as described in Lo Grasso et al.48.

The amount of 5-aza-dC (Sigma) to add to the medium was chosen after checking the effect of increasing concentrations of the drug on the cells on solid medium GYM (Supplementary Fig. S3). 5-azadC is reported to have a half-life of 20h-24h under conditions of physiological temperature and neutral pH50, so the treatment was repeated every 24 h, from 0 to 96 h. A control experiment was done in parallel using DMSO (the solvent of 5-aza-dC). 5 µM 5-aza-dC was the highest concentration in which the cells were still viable, while 10 and 15 were lethal for the cells, indeed a halo of growth inhibition was present. This is in accordance with results reported for E. coli23. Preliminary experiments were performed to set up the demethylation.

This is in accordance with results reported for E. coli23. In addition, a treatment was carried out to liquid cultures every 12 and 24 h, from 0 to 36 h. A control experiment was done in parallel using DMSO. The efficiency of demethylation was evaluated after 48 h of growth of S. coelicolor in the presence of 5 µM of 5-azadC added every 24 h and 12 h, by dot blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4). The results revealed that the efficiency of the treatment carried out every 24 h was 72%, while every 12 h was 99, 5%.

Antibiotic quantification Antibiotic quantification Antibiotic quantification To measure actinorhodin (intracellular and extracellular), cells were broken in their culture medium by adding KOH 0.1 N. Cellular debris was discarded by centrifugation, and actinorhodin was quantified spectrophotometrically with UV/visible spectrophotometer, applying the linear Beer-Lambert relationship to estimate concentration (Ɛ640 = 25,320). Undecylprodigiosin was measured after vacuum drying of the mycelium, followed by extraction with methanol, acidification with HCl (to 0.5 N), and spectrophotometric assay at 530 nm, again using the Beer-Lambert relationship to estimate concentration (Ɛ530 = 100,500). Reproducibility has been corroborated by at least three independent cultures at various developmental time points.

Disruption of the SCO1731 Disruption of the SCO1731 Disruption of the SCO1731 To generate the SCO1731::Tn5062 mutant, the cosmid I11.2.G06 containing a copy of the gene interrupted by the transposon Tn506241 was used. It contains the apramycin and kanamycin resistance cassettes in the transposon and in the cosmid, respectively. After transformation by interspecific conjugation with E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 as a donor strain, 8 apramycin resistant colonies were obtained.

Complementation of SCO1731::Tn5062 mutation Complementation of SCO1731::Tn5062 mutation Complementation of SCO1731::Tn5062 mutation A copy of SCO1731, placed under the control of its promoter was amplified via PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo), using the primers 1731_SpeI F 5′-GGACTAGTTGGCTGCCTCCTTACGGAT-3′ and 1731_compl R 5′-AAGATATCGTCTGGACGAGGACGAGTTC-3′ and was then cloned into pCR™-Blunt II-TOPO®. The sequences were checked via DNA sequencing using the M13 universal primers prior to subcloning them into pNG348 constructing the plasmid pNG3-1731compl (Table 2). The plasmid was used to transform the mutant SCO1731 strain by interspecific conjugation generating the SCO1731_compl strain. Thus, 32 colonies of putative SCO1731_compl strain were obtained after the growth in SFM with hygromycin. After 3 passages of these colonies on GYM with hygromycin, genomic DNA was extracted by 10 putative complemented strains and analyzed by PCR using the primers SCO4848_F 5′-CGTCGATCCCCTCGGTTG-3′ and SCO4848_R. 5′-GAGCCGGGAAAGCTCATTCA-3′. These primers amplified a fragment of 617 bp only if pNG3 is integrated at the attB site of SCO4848. Six of eight samples had the expected profile (Supplementary Fig. S7) and only the SCO1731_compl-8 was used for further experiment. A copy of SCO1731, placed under the control of its promoter was amplified via PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo), using the primers 1731_SpeI F 5′-GGACTAGTTGGCTGCCTCCTTACGGAT-3′ and 1731_compl R 5′-AAGATATCGTCTGGACGAGGACGAGTTC-3′ and was then cloned into pCR™-Blunt II-TOPO®.
