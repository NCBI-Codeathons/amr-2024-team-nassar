Abstract A better understanding of the genetic regulation of the biosynthesis of microbial compounds could accelerate the discovery of new biologically active molecules and facilitate their production. To this end, we have investigated the time course of genome‐wide transcription in the myxobacterium Sorangium sp. So ce836 in relation to its production of natural compounds. Time‐resolved RNA sequencing revealed that core biosynthesis genes from 48 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs; 92% of all BGCs encoded in the genome) were actively transcribed at specific time points in a batch culture. The majority (80%) of polyketide synthase and non‐ribosomal peptide synthetase genes displayed distinct peaks of transcription during exponential bacterial growth. Strikingly, these bursts in BGC transcriptional activity were associated with surges in the net production rates of known natural compounds, indicating that their biosynthesis was critically regulated at the transcriptional level. In contrast, BGC read counts from single time points had limited predictive value about biosynthetic activity, since transcription levels varied >100‐fold among BGCs with detected natural products. Taken together, our time‐course data provide unique insights into the dynamics of natural compound biosynthesis and its regulation in a wild‐type myxobacterium, challenging the commonly cited notion of preferential BGC expression under nutrient‐limited conditions. The close association observed between BGC transcription and compound production warrants additional efforts to develop genetic engineering tools for boosting compound yields from myxobacterial producer strains.

 et al. (2023) Bursts in biosynthetic gene cluster transcription are accompanied by surges of natural compound production in the myxobacterium Sorangium sp.. Microbial Biotechnology, 16, 1054–1068. Available from: 10.1111/1751-7915.14246 INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Natural products are important sources of biologically active molecules for the discovery of novel drugs (Newman & Cragg, 2020). In particular, the majority (71%) of small‐molecule antibiotics approved for clinical use since the 1980s are derived from natural products (Newman & Cragg, 2020). Two‐thirds of all naturally derived antibiotic compounds originate from actinobacteria (Barka et al., 2016), and consequently, their physiology and molecular biology have been studied intensely for several decades (van der Heul et al., 2018). In recent years, tremendous bacterial genome data deposited in public databases revealed that many bacteria from other phyla also have great potential for the synthesis of natural products (Gavriilidou et al., 2022). One of these groups of organisms are myxobacteria, which produce diverse natural products with unique structural features and bioactivities (Herrmann et al., 2017). Among the myxobacteria, the most prolific source of biomedically useful metabolites is as yet the genus Sorangium (Gerth et al., 2003; Hoffmann et al., 2018), which comprises at least eight distinct species (Mohr et al., 2018). Natural products from Sorangium spp. include for example, the antitumor compound epothilone (Altmann et al., 2009), the antibacterial and anti‐biofilm compound carolacton (Jansen et al., 2010), and the antifungal compound icumazole (Barbier et al., 2012). Natural products are important sources of biologically active molecules for the discovery of novel drugs (Newman & Cragg, 2020).

Even though natural compounds display enormous structural diversity, they originate from limited classes of biosynthetic pathways with common features, providing the basis for their classification into polyketides (PKs), non‐ribosomal peptides (NRPs), ribosomally synthesized and post‐translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), terpenoids and few others. The genes involved in a specific biosynthesis pathway are commonly arranged at adjacent positions on the bacterial producer's chromosome, in so‐called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Fischbach & Walsh, 2006). The bioinformatic detection of BGCs in DNA sequence data with the software tool antiSMASH uses a rule‐based approach and relies on the identification of core biosynthetic genes, for example, those encoding PK synthases or NRP synthetases, based on their conserved modular structures (Blin et al., 2021). Accessory genes surrounding the core biosynthetic genes within a predicted BGC region are annotated as additional biosynthetic, regulatory, or transport‐related genes, respectively, relying on secondary metabolite clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (smCOGs) (Medema et al., 2011). Co‐localized genes that do not fall into any of these categories are classified as ‘other genes’.

Co‐localized genes that do not fall into any of these categories are classified as ‘other genes’. Systematic analyses of previously described natural products suggested the existence of large natural reservoirs of structural novelty still awaiting discovery (Gregory et al., 2019; Pye et al., 2017). This insight has been corroborated by genomic analyses of microbial producer strains, which have repeatedly documented the genetic potential for compound biosynthesis to vastly exceed the diversity of natural products detected in laboratory cultures (Aigle et al., 2014; Baltz, 2017; Jones et al., 2016). The majority of BGCs could not be matched to any detected product, and have thus frequently been interpreted as ‘silent’, that is not being expressed under standard laboratory conditions (Hoskisson & Seipke, 2020; Okada & Seyedsayamdost, 2017). Indeed, in actinobacteria the production of several PKs and NRPs has been demonstrated to require triggering by specific external cues (van der Heul et al., 2018). Notably, the depletion of phosphate (Martín, 2004; Thomas et al., 2012), nitrogen (Voelker & Altaba, 2001), or carbon sources (Sánchez et al., 2010), among other stress factors, was identified to stimulate the biosynthesis of antibiotics and other ‘secondary metabolites’ (van Wezel & McDowall, 2011; Wohlleben et al., 2017). In Streptomyces spp., the transcriptional activity of genes encoding enzymes for synthesizing natural compounds was mostly observed at later stages of batch cultivation, after nutrients had been depleted, whereas it was repressed during exponential bacterial growth (Nieselt et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2019). It is not clear, however, to what extent a generalization of this observation from actinobacteria is justified for other microorganisms, since, for example, myxobacteria produce several natural compounds preferably during growth in nutrient‐rich media (Gerth et al., 1982; Kegler et al., 2006; Kunze et al., 1984; Rachid et al., 2007).

Investigations into the cellular regulation of BGC activities could facilitate control over the production of novel bioactive compounds, either by targeted molecular manipulation (Mungan et al., 2022; van der Heul et al., 2018) or by providing suitable extracellular cues (Okada & Seyedsayamdost, 2017). Transcriptional activities of BGCs and their regulation have been studied in Streptomyces (Hwang et al., 2019; Nieselt et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2019) and related actinobacteria (Tocchetti et al., 2015), and in a few other model organisms (Neubacher et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Insights into genetic regulatory circuits of natural compound synthesis in myxobacteria are more limited at present. Most previous transcriptomic studies on myxobacteria were driven by an interest in the genetic regulation of their multicellular developmental programme (McLoon et al., 2021; Müller et al., 2010; Muñoz‐Dorado et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2021) or changes during co‐operative predation on other bacteria (Livingstone et al., 2018), focusing on the model species Myxococcus xanthus. In agreement with the triggering events for antibiotic production in actinobacteria, the transcription of genes related to the biosynthesis of some polyketides and terpenoids in agar plate cultures of M. xanthus was shown to be enhanced after UV irradiation, presumably as part of a cellular SOS response (Sheng et al., 2021). In contrast, an early study on Sorangium sp. So ce56 that applied quantitative reverse‐transcription PCR demonstrated that three core biosynthesis genes in the BGC for the macrocyclic compound chivosazol were maximally transcribed during exponential growth of the bacterium, coinciding with the production of chivosazoles (Kegler et al., 2006). In follow‐up studies, Rachid et al. (2007, 2009) showed that transcription of the chivosazol BGC was under the control of the pleiotropic, positive regulator ChiR and the ammonia‐responsive, negative regulator NtcA. Furthermore, these authors succeeded in increasing chivosazol production by overexpressing chiR or inactivating the ntcA gene in the natural producer strain. Enhanced transcription of the BGC encoding epothilone biosynthesis in Sorangium sp. was achieved by co‐cultivation with other Sorangium spp. strains (Li et al., 2013) and by targeted molecular manipulation of the BGC promoter (Ye et al., 2019). In both these reports, enhanced transcription of BGC genes was directly associated with increased epothilone production yields (Li et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2019). Activation of silent biosynthetic gene clusters in myxobacteria was achieved by manipulation of the endogenous promotor sequences resulting in the identification of completely novel natural products (Panter et al., 2018). These examples demonstrate that a more thorough understanding of BGC expression and its genetic regulation will improve our abilities to control natural compound biosynthesis, to induce novel BGCs, or increase compound production yields.

The number of reads mapping to a gene were counted with HTSeq‐count with mode union and stranded reverse option (version 0.13.5; Anders et al., 2015). The analysis of genes differentially expressed over the time‐course experiment was based on DESeq2 (version 1.32.0; Love et al., 2014). For further analyses, we used the normalized read counts generated by DESeq2.

RESULTS RESULTS Genome sequence revealed biosynthetic potential of Sorangium sp. So ce836 Genome sequence revealed biosynthetic potential of Sorangium sp. So ce836 Genome sequence revealed biosynthetic potential of Sorangium sp. So ce836 The So ce836 genome (GenBank accession: CP102233) has a size of 14,555,308 bp and encodes 10,611 genes, including 10,570 protein‐coding sequences. Analysis with the bioinformatic tool antiSMASH (version 6.1.1) (Blin et al., 2021) predicted a total of 45 BGC regions. Our detailed analysis of the BGC regions showed that four of these likely constituted several BGCs (see below), resulting in a total of 52 BGCs. Among these BGCs, only six showed close similarity (i.e. above 60% amino acid similarity) to BGCs with known natural products reported in the MIBiG database (Table S1) (Kautsar et al., 2019). Thirty BGCs encoded the syntheses of NRPs, PKs, or hybrids of these (Table S1). Predicted BGCs encompassed a total of 414 genes, comprising 4% of all protein‐coding sequences in So ce836, and 307 of these (74%; 81 core biosynthetic, 131 additional biosynthetic, 42 transport‐related, 53 regulatory) were associated with the production of NRPs and PKs. The antiSMASH output labelled different types of genes with different colours, which we also utilize throughout this manuscript (‘core biosynthetic’ in dark red, ‘additional biosynthetic’ in coral, ‘transport‐related’ in blue, and ‘regulatory’ in green).

We analysed the time course of genome‐wide transcription in the So ce836 cultures by sequencing RNA from samples collected at five different time points: days 4, 7, 11, 14, and 21. These time points were selected on the basis of preliminary experiments to represent the phases of a full growth cycle. The transcription of 8311 genes (78% of all genes) varied significantly over the time‐course experiment, as indicated by a likelihood ratio test. These are referred to as ‘differentially expressed’ genes in the following text. In contrast, the transcription levels of 20% of all genes did not vary significantly between time points, and an additional 2% of genes were excluded from further analyses due to low read counts. To compare time courses of transcription between differentially expressed genes, we analysed deviations from the genes' mean transcription levels at five time points. We found that the timing of transcription varied widely, and k‐means clustering of these temporal patterns into five transcription groups clearly associated with maximal transcription at the different growth times (Figure 2) (initially, a hierarchical clustering approach had justified the grouping into five groups; not shown). Genes in transcription group 1 (2435 genes, 29% of differentially expressed genes) showed a tendency for maximal transcription on day 4, that is during early exponential growth (Figure 2). A majority of genes in transcription group 2 (1670 genes, 20%) were maximally transcribed on day 7 of the experiment, that is also during exponential growth (Figure 2). In contrast, transcription group 3 (1876 genes, 23%) contained genes that were strongly transcribed at the beginning of the stationary phase (day 11), and the transcription of genes in groups 4 (1100 genes, 13%) and 5 (1230 genes, 15%) peaked on days 14 and 21, respectively (Figure 2). Hence, in summary, transcription groups 1 and 2 mainly contained genes (totalling 39% of all genes) that reached their maximum transcription during exponential growth, whereas most genes in the other three transcription groups (3, 4, and 5; 40% of all genes) were maximally transcribed in later growth phases (Figure 2). We analysed the time course of genome‐wide transcription in the So ce836 cultures by sequencing RNA from samples collected at five different time points: days 4, 7, 11, 14, and 21. These time points were selected on the basis of preliminary experiments to represent the phases of a full growth cycle. The transcription of 8311 genes (78% of all genes) varied significantly over the time‐course experiment, as indicated by a likelihood ratio test.

Analysis of temporal transcription supported the identification of individual BGCs Analysis of temporal transcription supported the identification of individual BGCs Analysis of temporal transcription supported the identification of individual BGCs Core biosynthetic genes within specific BGC regions commonly followed similar temporal transcription patterns (Figure 3, Figure S1), likely due to their organization in single, co‐transcribed operons (Fischbach & Walsh, 2006). However, a few BGC regions predicted by antiSMASH exhibited deviating transcription of their core genes over time, including BGC regions 7, 20, 25, and 41 (Figure S2). Closer inspection showed that each of these regions likely constituted several BGCs (Figure S3), since their BGC core genes were spatially separated or located on different DNA strands. Consequently, we split BGC region 7 into two subregions (7_1 and 7_2), corresponding to antiSMASH‐predicted core genes involved in the biosynthesis of resorcinol and a phenazine compound, respectively (Table S1). Similarly, BGC region 20 was split into three subregions (20_1 ‐ 20_3) and region 41 was split into two (41_1, 41_2). BGC subregion 41_1 was predicted to encode the biosynthesis of a redox‐cofactor and the other subregions are likely involved in the production of NRPs or NRP/PK‐hybrids (Table S1). We assigned genes other than core biosynthetic genes within overlapping regions to both BGC subregions (Figure S3).

Temporal transcription patterns did not always coincide with BGC boundaries, however. Region 25 included four spatially separated groups of BGC core genes (Figure S4), three of which encoded thioesterase at the C‐terminal ends of their last core gene, suggesting independent biosynthetic pathways within this region (Schwarzer & Marahiel, 2001). Subregion 25_3 represents the previously described epothilone BGC with a 100% protein similarity to MIBiG entries (BGC0000989–BGC0000991; Julien et al., 2000; Molnár et al., 2000; Tang et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 2013). Moreover, we indeed detected epothilone A production by So ce836 via LC/MS analysis (Figure 4B). Subregion 25_4 shares 62% similarity and an identical gene order with the glidopeptin BGC (MIBiG entry BGC0001608; Wang et al., 2018).

This means a statistically significant over‐representation of core genes among the two groups, which both displayed a strong tendency for maximum transcription in the exponential growth phase (Figure 2, Table S2). Transport‐related genes and additional biosynthetic genes within BGCs often showed similar temporal trends of transcription as the core genes (Figures S5 and S6). In contrast, transcription of regulatory genes from these BGCs exhibited deviating temporal patterns (Figure S7). Of note, however, the smCOG‐based prediction of these accessory genes is less reliable than the rule‐based identification of core biosynthetic genes (Medema et al., 2011). Therefore, we focused on the latter for our further analyses.

For comparison, we plotted the temporal transcription of forty‐four genes encoding ribosomal proteins (Figure 3, Table S3). The transcription activity of most ribosomal protein genes also peaked during the exponential growth phase, but their temporal patterns nevertheless differed markedly from BGC core genes by showing additional transcription maxima on days 14 and 21 (Figure 3, Figure S8). For comparison, we plotted the temporal transcription of forty‐four genes encoding ribosomal proteins (Figure 3, Table S3).

Other BGC classes displayed more variable transcriptional patterns Other BGC classes displayed more variable transcriptional patterns Other BGC classes displayed more variable transcriptional patterns The So ce836 genome encodes 13 BGCs for potential RiPPs, six for terpenes, and one each for phosphonate, resorcinol, and phenazine compounds (Table S1). The core genes of these BGC classes showed more diverse temporal transcription patterns compared to NRP‐ and PK‐related BGCs (Figures S1, S9 and S10). From the 21 core genes of RiPP‐related BGCs, 15 were significantly differentially expressed and eight of these (53%) reached their maximal transcription level in the exponential phase (days 4 and 7) (Figure S1). The BGCs associated with the production of terpenes contain six core genes (Figure S9), only two of which were maximally transcribed in the exponential phase, whereas two reached their maximal transcription level in the death phase (at day 21). The resorcinol‐ and phenazine‐related BGCs are localized close to each other on the genome, but yet their temporal expression differed strongly, indicating different mechanisms of transcriptional regulation (Figure S10). So ce836 was also predicted to produce a phosphonate, encoded by BGC region 38. The corresponding core gene was most strongly expressed in the early exponential phase (day 4) and in the death phase (day 21).

BGC core gene expression was correlated with metabolite net production rates BGC core gene expression was correlated with metabolite net production rates BGC core gene expression was correlated with metabolite net production rates Strain So ce836 produced large amounts of the natural compound icumazole A. The concentration of icumazole A, as measured by HPLC based on its absorption of UV light (304 nm, 15.27 min retention time), was maximal on day 11 and decreased thereafter, suggesting the compound was catabolized by the bacterium or otherwise degraded (Figure 4A, blue curve). We determined the net compound production rate (arbitrary units) at each time point by assessing the slope of the concentration curve and then related it to the concentration of bacterial cells in the culture at the same time point (as shown in Figure 1) to estimate the net compound production rate per cell. As a result, we found that the net icumazole A production rate per myxobacterial cell peaked on day 7, that is during exponential growth (Figure 4A, green curve). Strikingly, this net cellular icumazole A production rate correlated strongly with the transcriptional pattern of the 10 core genes from the icumazole BGC (r = 0.88; Xie et al., 2022), since the maximum deviation from mean transcription was also reached on day 7 (Figure 4A, red curves).

At the same time, we also detected epothilones in the metabolome of So ce836. Epothilone A was only weakly detectable by UV absorption (250 nm, 9.05 min retention time) at most time points, and since quantification of epothilone A by UV absorption and mass spectroscopy gave similar results for days 4–14 (Figure S11), we relied on LC/MS mass peaks (494.2571 m/z, 9.05 min retention time) to estimate the relative concentration of epothilone A. Similar to icumazole A, the concentration of epothilone A in the growth medium was highest in the stationary phase (Figure 4B, blue curve). Again, the net cellular production rate of epothilone A was maximal on day 7, and it correlated with the time course of transcription of epothilone BGC core genes (r = 0.78) (Figure 4B, green and red curves). At the same time, we also detected epothilones in the metabolome of So ce836.

Again, the net cellular production rate of epothilone A was maximal on day 7, and it correlated with the time course of transcription of epothilone BGC core genes (r = 0.78) (Figure 4B, green and red curves). Taken together, we observed that bursts of BGC core gene transcription were accompanied by distinct surges in net production rates per cell for the two known compounds icumazole A and epothilone A. Even though temporal dynamics of normalized BGC core gene transcription and compound production rates were highly similar for these compounds (Figure 4), absolute transcription levels of the core genes (i.e. sequencing read counts per kilobase) differed more than 100‐fold between associated BGCs (Table S1, Figure S8). Notably at maximum transcription on day 7, the median number of normalized sequencing read counts mapped to the icumazole BGC core genes was 428 per kilobase (1732–12,799 reads per gene), and for the epothilone BGC was only 3 per kilobase (13–55 reads per gene) (Figure 6, Figure S8). And on day 4, when almost no icumazole A net production was detectable, the median number of sequencing reads mapped to icumazole BGC core genes was at its minimum of 15 per kilobase (55–399 reads per gene), but yet this number was larger than the maximal transcription level of the epothilone BGC core genes (Figure S8). The transcript levels of other BGCs were intermediate between those of epothilone and icumazole BGCs, except for four BGCs with slightly lower read counts than the epothilone BGC and five BGCs that had even higher read counts per kilobase than the icumazole BGC, although we were unable to detect their (as yet unknown) natural products (Figure 6, Table S1).

While the net cellular production rates of both icumazole A and epothilone A were maximal during exponential growth, the highest relative concentrations of the compounds were reached in later growth phases (Figure 4). This might be due to the accumulation of compounds over time and the large, metabolite‐producing biomass available in the batch culture towards the end of the experiment.

COG categorization relates transcription groups to cellular functions COG categorization relates transcription groups to cellular functions COG categorization relates transcription groups to cellular functions To assess the temporal transcription in a genome‐wide context with respect to cellular function, we classified the proteins encoded in the So ce836 genome into Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG; Table S4) (Galperin et al., 2015). Out of 8311 differentially expressed genes, we could associate 6081 (73%) to COG categories using the eggNOG‐mapper (Cantalapiedra et al., 2021). We then performed an over‐/under‐representation analysis of COG categories within each of the five transcription groups (Table S5). Among genes in transcription group 1 (maximally transcribed on day 4, i.e. during early exponential growth), COG categories E (‘Amino acid transport and metabolism’), M (‘Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’) and F (‘Nucleotide transport and metabolism’) were significantly over‐represented compared to their distribution among all annotated and differentially expressed genes in So ce836 (for adjusted p‐values based on the hypergeometric distribution with subsequent multiple testing correction, see Table S5). In transcription group 2 (maximally transcribed on day 7), categories P (‘Inorganic ion transport and metabolism’), J (‘Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis’), H (‘Coenzyme transport and metabolism’), and Q (‘Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism’) were significantly over‐represented. Hence, the distribution of genes classified to COG category Q (‘Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism’) confirmed our previous notion of BGC transcription mostly during exponential bacterial growth. In contrast, in transcription group 3 (maximally transcribed on day 11, i.e. during the early stationary phase), COG categories J, P, and E were significantly under‐represented, whereas category O (‘Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones’) was over‐represented (although the latter was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing; Table S5). In transcription group 5 (maximally transcribed on day 21), category G (‘Carbohydrate transport and metabolism’) was over‐represented.

DISCUSSION DISCUSSION Our data show that the transcription of BGCs in Sorangium sp. is determined by bacterial growth. In a batch culture, the transcription level of most BGC core genes (PKSs and NRPSs in particular) was maximal during exponential growth, when the cellular metabolism was simultaneously engaged in the synthesis of cell wall components, proteins and nucleic acids, and in trans‐membrane transport activities (as indicated by the functional analysis of genome‐wide transcription patterns). As soon as bacterial growth ceased and the culture reached the stationary phase, BGC transcription quickly levelled off. Strikingly, transcriptional bursting of BGC core genes appeared to directly determine the net synthesis rates of the NRP/PK‐hybrids epothilone A and icumazole A. Such a correlation between natural compound synthesis and BGC transcription explains the success of previous attempts to boost compound production by increasing the level of transcription (Peng et al., 2018; Rachid et al., 2007, 2009; Ye et al., 2019). This result also suggests that biosynthesis proteins may get degraded (Trötschel et al., 2013) or their activities downregulated during later growth stages, which coincides with the observation of increased transcriptional activities of genes involved with protein modification and turnover in the early stationary phase. The close association between BGC transcription and compound production observed here for a wild‐type Sorangium strain warrants efforts towards developing improved genetic engineering tools for this organism, since the molecular manipulation of transcriptional regulation may be a viable strategy for improving compound yields. Our data show that the transcription of BGCs in Sorangium sp. is determined by bacterial growth. In a batch culture, the transcription level of most BGC core genes (PKSs and NRPSs in particular) was maximal during exponential growth, when the cellular metabolism was simultaneously engaged in the synthesis of cell wall components, proteins and nucleic acids, and in trans‐membrane transport activities (as indicated by the functional analysis of genome‐wide transcription patterns). As soon as bacterial growth ceased and the culture reached the stationary phase, BGC transcription quickly levelled off.

Of note, absolute transcription levels varied widely between BGCs, including those for epothilone and icumazole. It is currently unknown which level of BGC transcription may be required for natural compound production. Our results indicate that the transcription level may vary over several orders of magnitude among active BGCs, even within a single genome, suggesting it may be difficult to find any universal threshold for transcription above which the production of detectable amounts of natural compounds could reliably be predicted (Mungan et al., 2022). Our data also show that BGC read counts at single time points may provide limited information about compound synthesis. Rather, time course data were required to resolve the transcriptional bursts that were accompanied by increased rates of compound production in Sorangium sp.

One limitation of our analysis is that it relied on measurements of net production rates of compounds from the bulk of the bacterial culture, whereas we could not directly assess the underlying synthesis rates within bacterial cells. Decay of icumazole A clearly dominated over its synthesis during the late stages of the batch culture, but it is unknown whether the compound was equally unstable while the bacteria were growing or whether it was actively degraded. Hence, the measured net production rates likely resulted from both synthesis and concomitant degradation, adding complexity to understanding their genetic regulation. Arguably however, the net production rate is the most relevant measure for biotechnology.

So ce836 were differentially expressed over our time‐course experiment, that is their transcription levels varied significantly over time. Moreover, this was true for all core genes of the majority of BGCs, and their temporal transcription patterns were largely synchronous within BGCs. These results indicate that the majority of BGCs in the genome were transcriptionally active, even though we had applied only a single cultivation condition. This observation contradicts the assumption of widespread transcriptional silence of BGCs in laboratory cultures (Okada & Seyedsayamdost, 2017). Similarly, an earlier investigation applying microarray and proteome analyses had demonstrated that the majority of BGCs in an M. xanthus culture were expressed (Bode et al., 2009; Schley et al., 2006), and hence, this may be a common pattern in myxobacteria. Note, however, that our present study provides rich insights into genome‐wide temporal patterns of gene activity that were not resolved previously on the basis of microarray hybridization or quantitative PCR (Bode et al., 2009). Generally, the temporal dynamics of BGC transcription, translation, and natural compound assembly in bacteria are poorly understood (Machado et al., 2017). Following the transcription of BGC genes, the synthesis of natural compounds may be regulated at the translational or posttranslational levels, or limited by the supply of building blocks, cofactors, or energy (Wenzel & Müller, 2009).

It must also be taken into consideration that an observed discrepancy between the genomic endowment with biosynthetic genes and the yield of natural compounds may be caused by limitations of the techniques for metabolite extraction and analysis (Amos et al., 2017; Panter et al., 2021). Due to the inherent complexity of metabolome data, it is generally challenging to discover unknown natural compounds and associate them with their BGCs (Panter et al., 2021). However, if the net cellular production of natural compounds is correlated with BGC transcription also in other cases similar to epothilone and icumazole, we suggest that temporal transcriptome patterns may provide useful criteria for filtering of time‐resolved metabolome data.

Our observation of high natural compound production rates in growing myxobacterial cells challenges the frequently cited notion of preferred BGC expression during late bacterial growth phases, which is based on observations on Streptomyces spp. and other actinobacteria (van der Heul et al., 2018; van Wezel & McDowall, 2011; Wohlleben et al., 2017). It suggests that adjusted batch runtimes, product retention approaches, or even continuous fermentation might offer the potential for maximization of biotechnological product yields from myxobacteria (Frykman et al., 2005).

Diverse temporal transcription patterns of BGCs in So ce836 suggested their independent regulation, probably reflecting different roles of associated compounds. Myxobacterial formation of fruiting bodies usually occurs in older cultures and is thought to be triggered by starvation (Muñoz‐Dorado et al., 2019). Therefore, preferred BGC transcription during maximum bacterial growth seemed to restrict any direct roles of associated natural compounds in fruiting body formation, even though our experiments with agitated liquid cultures were not ideal to investigate this process. Generally, the physiological and ecological roles of microbial natural compounds are very little understood (Phillips et al., 2022; Schmidt et al., 2019), and time‐resolved investigations of their biosynthesis and its regulation may provide valuable insights into associations of these molecules with the producer's cellular processes or interactions with other organisms.

To our knowledge, our study for the first time relates the temporal dynamics of BGC expression to patterns of genome‐wide transcription in any myxobacterium. A more detailed understanding of the diversity of BGC expression and regulation will facilitate the discovery of novel natural compounds, the induction of their synthesis, and the optimization of their large‐scale production.
