However, these functions are adversely affected by long-term synthetic fertilizer application. We developed a modified CRISPR/Cas9 system using non-specific single-guide RNAs to disrupt the genome-wide cis-acting catabolite-responsive elements (cres) in a wild-type Bacillus pumilus strain, which conferred dual plant-benefit properties. Most of the mutations occurred around imperfectly matched cis-acting elements (cre-like sites) in genes that are mainly involved in carbon and secondary metabolism pathways. The comparative metabolomics and transcriptome results revealed that carbon is likely transferred to some pigments, such as riboflavin, carotenoid, and lycopene, or non-ribosomal peptides, such as siderophore, surfactin, myxochelin, and bacilysin, through the pentose phosphate and amino acid metabolism pathways. Collectively, these findings suggested that the mutation of global cre-like sequences in the genome might alter carbon flow, thereby allowing beneficial biological interactions between the rhizobacteria and plants.

With accelerated agricultural development, long-term synthetic fertilizer application to soil always adversely affects PGPR functions, such as loss of antibiotic production, antifungal activity, and root colonization traits.1 We isolated a wild-type Bacillus pumilus strain from intensively cultivated soil that had lost its PGPR potential. We aimed to develop a method to improve its PGPR ability, which would be important for sustainable agriculture with reduced use of chemical fertilizers. Bacillus strains play an essential role in maintaining soil health and promoting plant growth, and are considered as one of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). With accelerated agricultural development, long-term synthetic fertilizer application to soil always adversely affects PGPR functions, such as loss of antibiotic production, antifungal activity, and root colonization traits.1 We isolated a wild-type Bacillus pumilus strain from intensively cultivated soil that had lost its PGPR potential. We aimed to develop a method to improve its PGPR ability, which would be important for sustainable agriculture with reduced use of chemical fertilizers. Gene manipulation techniques have been used to restore PGPR potential. For example, the integration of desired genes, such as the isolation of the chitinase-encoding gene chi113 from Bacillus subtilis Ap113 and its expression in Burkholderia vietnamiensis, which induced significant biocontrol effects on wheat sheath blight and tomato gray mold.2 Genome reduction approaches have also been used, e.g., using double crossover homologous recombination to knock out the 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase-encoding gene bdh in Bacillus velezensis GJ11, constructed in a mutant strain with a high level of acetoin to trigger induced systemic resistance against Pseudomonas syringae infection in plants.3 However, conventional methods based on homologous recombination to construct engineered Bacillus strains remain time-consuming, require a relatively high transformation efficiency, and only focus on a single PGPR attribute.4 Recent studies have achieved some breakthroughs using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) system to edit and regulate multiple genes simultaneously.5,6 Gene manipulation techniques have been used to restore PGPR potential.

Rhizobacteria have advantages in terms of root colonization, which is dependent on their preference of rhizodeposits secreted by plants, such as organic acids, proteins, amino acids, and sugars.7 Moreover, plant growth, stress tolerance, and disease resistance can be enhanced by the secretion of certain secondary metabolites, such as siderophore, bacilysin, and surfactin. We speculated that gram-positive rhizobacteria in the soil, such as Bacillus species, might change their preferred carbon source because of their domestication under the effects of long-term chemical-fertilizer farming. Thus, they are subject to carbon catabolite repression (CCR) of many genes involved in secondary metabolism, which is a global mechanism of catabolite repression in the genus Bacillus. The presence of a rapidly metabolizable carbon source in the growth medium inhibits the synthesis of catabolic enzymes for other carbon sources. The mechanism of catabolite repression is mainly exerted through a “cis-acting catabolite-responsive element (cres)” in the promoter regions of the target genes.8,9 The cre site was first observed in Bacillus subtilis 168 in 1987 by Nicholson in the promoter region of the amylase gene (amyE) and has since been found in many operon promoters in the genome of the Bacillus genus, with the consensus sequence “WWGNAANCGNWNNCW”.10,11 Sometimes, the integration of only PGPR-associated genes into a heterogeneous host might not yield the desired results because of the original complex cascade regulatory system of their promoters. Mutation or replacement of the related part of the promoter might be an effective approach to enhance the function of these genes. Herein, we aimed to use the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to globally interfere with cre-like sites in the genome of a Bacillus pumilus strain, with the hope of restoring its agricultural function.

Herein, we aimed to use the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to globally interfere with cre-like sites in the genome of a Bacillus pumilus strain, with the hope of restoring its agricultural function. We searched for cre-like sequences using the previous cre site consensus sequence and identified 4465 potential sites in the genome. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated multiple gene editing using a non-specific single-guide RNA (UgRNA) was used to edit the genome-wide cre-like sites. Previously, we found seven target genes with mutations at their cre sites that resulted in the mutant strain exhibiting a carbon catabolite repression (CCR)-release phenotype, such as secreting a large number of secondary metabolites.12,13 Here, we continue to report the editing results occurring in other regions of the genome, and used omics analysis of the mutant strain to reveal the connection between the plant-beneficial functions and cre-like site editing.

Results and discussion Results and discussion Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) resulting from global cres perturbation Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) resulting from global cres perturbation Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) resulting from global cres perturbation In our previous study, we designed three UgRNAs targeting the cre sites of seven genes, namely an acetate kinase gene (ackA), an aminotransferase gene (ntdA), a phosphocarrier protein HPr gene (ptsH), an acetolactate decarboxylase gene (budA), an acetyl-CoA synthetase gene (acsA), a succinate-CoA ligase gene (sucC), and a xylose isomerase gene (xylA), using 30–70% sequence similarity. These UgRNAs successfully induced mutations at their cre sites in B. pumilus LG3145. Compared with the wild-type (WT), the mutant strain exhibited a clear CCR release phenotype, as evidenced by the secretion of extracellular pigments, proteins, and the formation of polysaccharide capsules. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed that the non-specific gRNA/Cas9 system (UgRNA/Cas9) edited 3370 genes, primarily enriched in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, regulatory and transporter systems, and carbon and amino acid metabolism pathways (Data S1). We isolated total RNA from the WT and LG3145 strains cultivated using different carbon sources for transcriptome analysis. The expression levels of approximately 3400 effective genes in B. pumilus were analyzed using a threshold Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) > 1. According to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, these genes were mainly enriched in carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, and secondary metabolism pathways, and the membrane transport system. A comparison with the WT grown using glycerol as the carbon source (GLY) showed a greater number of upregulated genes than downregulated genes, especially in carbohydrate metabolism (Figure 1A). For example, there were 17 upregulated and 7 downregulated genes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (ko00020), 27 upregulated and 16 downregulated genes in glycolysis (ko00010), 27 upregulated and 19 downregulated genes in pyruvate metabolism (ko00620), and 24 upregulated and 9 downregulated genes in amino sugar metabolism (ko00520). These results suggested that the metabolic flux of carbohydrates and amino acid metabolism is likely to increase when strain LG3145 uses glycerol as a carbon source and produces more secondary metabolites. Interestingly, the expression levels of all the 15 genes in overflow metabolism (ko00640) declined, which might reduce acid production and redirect carbon sources to the TCA cycle or pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In amino acid metabolism, 35 genes were upregulated and only 9 were downregulated in the cysteine and methionine synthesis pathway (ko00270), and 24 were upregulated and only 12 were downregulated in glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism (ko00260). In secondary metabolism, the unique biosynthesis pathway of siderophore group nonribosomal peptides (ko01053) had six upregulated genes, and the biosynthesis of various antibiotics pathway (ko00998) had seven upregulated genes, suggesting that strain LG3145 might produce more antibacterial substances (Data S2). Moreover, there was no significant difference in membrane transporter, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism while using glucose (GLU) or GLY as carbon sources (Figure 1B). These results indicated that the mutant strain LG3145 can grow normally and produce secondary metabolites using GLY as a carbon source. Furthermore, the fatty acid (FA) (ko00061) and carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906) pathways uniquely increased, with 12 and 4 upregulated genes, respectively, which might cause strain LG3145 to produce pigments (Data S3). Finally, the transcriptome analysis data obtained in triplicate were aggregated and depicted in Figure 1C. Notably, the expression levels of 1926 medium-related genes in strain LG3145 cultivated in GLY were comparable to those of glucose-grown cells, but were significantly higher than those of the WT strain grown in GLY. Conversely, only 60 genes were not expressed in strain LG3145 grown in GLY. These results indicated that mutant strain LG3145 has a greater capacity to utilize GLY as a carbon source, and exhibited gene expression levels equivalent to those observed when GLU was used as the carbon source.Figure 1Transcriptomic and comparative transcriptomic feature of strain LG3145(A) Major differences in metabolic pathways of strain LG3145 compared with the wild-type strain (WT) cultivated in glycerol minimal medium (GYMM) for 12 h.(B) Major differences in metabolic pathways of strain LG3145 in GYMM and in glucose minimal medium (GUMM) cultivated for 12 h.(C) Global abundance of the gene expression of the WT and LG3145 strains throughout the cultivation period in GYMM (GLY _WT, GLY_LG3145) and GUMM (GLU_LG3145).

To understand the relationship between cre UgRNA/Cas9 editing and the phenotypic changes of strain LG3145, we selected some rate-limiting enzyme encoding genes or operons for DNA sequencing analysis (Figure S1). DNA sequencing of 35 genes or operons showed that more than 50 cre-like sites were edited by the UgRNAs/Cas9 system, including deletion, insertion, transversion, and transition mutations (Figure S2; Table 1). In this paper, the cre-like sequences with mismatches to the query sequence on the anti-sense and sense strands are given as the first and second numbers or with an underline in brackets, e.g., [0,0] means a perfect match; [0,0] means a perfect match to cre on the sense strand, [1,0] means the cre is same as the transcription direction of the target gene with only one mismatch; and [0,1] means the cre is opposite to the transcription direction with one mismatch. Most mutation sites were the [1,0], [2,0], and [0,2] types of cre-like sequences, and few of them occurred as cre [0,0], being perfectly matched with the consensus, except for ackA and sucC among the seven previous target genes and the glpFKD operon involved in GLY metabolism. These results suggested that cre-like sequences with one or two mismatch sites are the most edited targets by the UgRNA/Cas9 system.Table 1The prediction of cres in some operon in B. pumilus WTGene or operoncre-like and flanking sequencea,bTxSScGene or operoncre-like and flanking sequencea,bTxSScackATATCG ATGTAAGCGGTAACA[0,0] GTTCA−52sucCTTAAA ATGAAAGCGCAGTCT[0,0] ATTTT−6glpFKDAGAGG ATGAAAACGTTGTCA[0,0] ATAAA−190glkCAATT TTT*AAAGCT*GAAACA[2,0] ATATA−330ATTTA AAGAAATCA*CTCGCA[1,0] TATCA81glmSTGTTG ATGCAAACGTAGCA*T[1,0] CTTCA−259ptsGHITAACT ATGAAATG*GATGTCA[1,0] GGGAG−66glmMCTCTT TAGGG*ACT*GCTCTT*T[3,0] TTCTA−191ykgBAAATA TG*A*CAAACGGTTTCT[0,2] CAAAT−148glmUACAGC ATTTAAAA*GAAAA*CA[0,2] TCCAT−157crrCGTGT ATGAAACG*A*TACGCT[0,2] CATAC−45murACAAGG AAGAAATT*GCTGACT[0,1] GCAGA−189fsaATCTT G*AGAAAGCGCAATCA[1,0] AATTT−59TGCAA TAGCAATGGTAATGA[0,2] GCATC−214fbaAAGGTT TTGCAAAG*T*GTGTCA[0,2] AAGCA−261murCCAATT TTGGAATT*GGACGCT[1,0] TTTCG−248ATCCA AAGAAC*TCGGTGCT*T[2,0] TGACA−276mraY/murDCCATC AAA*AAAT T*GCATTCA[0,2] TTATT−56eno/gpm/tpi/pgkAAATA AAT*AAACCGTTCACA[1,0] GTTTT211murEAGCCA TTGTAG*CA*GAACACC*[3,0] CTCTT193gap/cggRAAGAG TTGAAAAT*GAAAGA*T[2,0] TATCC−130murGBTTGTT TAGAAAACGTG*TAT*T[2,0] TTGAC−110CATGG ATGAAT*TCA*TTCAA*T[3,0] ATAGA−255TTATT TTGCAAAA*GTATAA*A[2,0] AAAAT−161tktGATAA TAC*AAAACGGTCTCT[0,1] GTTAA171TGCTG AAGCT*AAT*GAAACCA[2,0] TGTTG−190pdhABCDATGTT TC*GAC*AACGATCCCA[2,0] GTGGC−127pyk/pfkA/accADGACAT TTGCAAAT*GAATGCA[1,0] AAACA189pgiGGAAC TAGCT*ATT* GAAATCA[0,2] AGTAA−67srfAGGAGG ATGAAAAT*GAATACA[1,0] GTTTA−6GGCTT TTA*AAATCGCTAAA*A[0,2] TGTCA−155bacABCDFACACA TTT*GAAACGTAAGCT[1,0] CCATT−161guaBAAATA AAT*AAACCGTTCACA[1,0] GTTTT−259bacGAAACA AAGGAACCGGTGTCT[0,0] CTTTT189tenAGTCGT ATGTAAGT*C*CTCACT[0,2] AATCG183AGGGA TTGGAAAG*GCAATCG*[2,0] CCATA70ribACGACTC*AGGAAGCGCAGTG*A[0,2] TGGTG−83GTGTA C*CGATGGCCC*ATGAT[0,2] CCGCT−235ribBDATAAA AAGGCAAA*GAA*CGCT[0,2] CAAAG58aroACATTG TACCAAC*CTCATA*CA[2,0] TATAA−68crtNIMAACGA TAC*GAAACGCAAAA*T[2,0] GGATC389aroBCGAGAT T*TGAAGCGTTCG*CG[2,0] GCTGC126TCGTC TTGGAAAA*T*CAATCT[0,2] ATACA273GCGCA AA*TGAAACGAAGA*TT[2,0] AACGT77AATGT AAGAAAGCC*GG*CCCT[2,0] TTATT−145aroGGATCA ATGAAAGA*GGAAACA[1,0] TTGTA73crtPAAGAA TTTAAACA*GATCA*CA[2,0] AGGAC−71liaGFRSAAACT AAGAAATCA*GAGACA[0,1] GGTCG−113AAGGA TATGACGCGT*ATG*CT[2,0] TGGCG−165liaHIATCCA ATA*AAAAA*GCACTCT[0,2] TCAAT−143ConsensusWWGNAANCGNWNNCW (W:A /T, N:A/T/G/C)aThe sequences shown in this table are cre-like sequences searched by SnapGene with the query sequence WWGNAANCGNWNNCW (W:A /T, N:A/T/G/C) in the genome of B. pumilus SH-B9, which are classified using the modified Ogiwara cres search method.bThe cre-like sequences with the mismatch numbers to the query sequence on the anti-sense and sense strands are given as the first and second numbers or with an underline in brackets. e.g. [0,0] means perfect match; [0,0] means a perfect match to cre on the sense strand, [1,0] means the cre is same as the transcription direction of target gene with only one mismatch; and [0,1] means opposite to the transcription direction with one mismatch.cTxSS means the distance of each cre from the transcription start site (TSS). To understand the relationship between cre UgRNA/Cas9 editing and the phenotypic changes of strain LG3145, we selected some rate-limiting enzyme encoding genes or operons for DNA sequencing analysis (Figure S1).

Metabolic alterations caused by DEGs Metabolic alterations caused by DEGs Metabolic alterations caused by DEGs As previously discussed, several cre-like sites located upstream of genes involved in key pathways related to metabolism were precisely edited using UgRNA/Cas9. To further investigate the underlying mechanism, we employed ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to analyze the metabolites of B. pumilus LG3145 cultured on GLY as a carbon source. The differential metabolites between the edited strain and the WT strain were identified and annotated for enrichment using KEGG, as depicted in Figure 2A and Data S4. Notably, the significantly altered metabolites (p value <0.05, |log2 fold-change [FC]| ≥ 1) were found to be concentrated in three metabolic pathways: biosynthesis of siderophore group nonribosomal peptides (ko01053), riboflavin metabolism (ko00740), and lysine biosynthesis (ko00300), which was consistent with the differential gene enrichment data depicted in Figure 2B and marked by the reverse red arrow. Thus, UgRNA/Cas9 editing significantly affected these three metabolic pathways. Additionally, as shown in Figure 2A, porphyrin metabolism (ko00860) and peptidoglycan biosynthesis (ko00550) were identified as significantly altered pathways. Notably, the gene numbers of their precursor synthesis pathways, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (ko00970) and vitamin B6 metabolism (ko00970; depicted by blue arrows in the same direction), and amino sugar metabolism (ko00520; depicted by green arrows), respectively, were also significantly altered (Figure 2B and Data S5).Figure 2Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment pathways analysis of altered metabolites and genes when strain LG3145 used glycerol as carbon source, and comparative analysis of differential metabolites and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when strain LG3145 used glycerol and glucose as carbon sources(A) Enriched metabolite pathways.(B) Enriched gene pathways.

The volcano plots in Figures 2C and 2D depict a comparison of metabolites and genes between the WT and mutant strain LG3145. Among them, there were 259 upregulated and 277 downregulated metabolites, as well as 505 upregulated genes and 465 downregulated genes (p value <0.05, |log2 fold-change [FC]| ≥ 1). Notably, we examined the names of the most significantly different metabolites and genes, and noted that some of them were linked. For example, the overexpression of a glycerol kinase encoding gene, glpK, shown in Figure 2D might explain the presence of (S)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA (C05260) in Figure 2C, while the overexpression of a surfactin synthetase encoding gene, srfAA, shown in Figure 2D, might be responsible for the presence of surfactin (C12043) in Figure 2C. Expression of the operon liaFGHI, which belongs to the two-component system (ko02020), was significantly increased, which is associated with daptomycin resistance (a structural analog of surfactin). These results suggested that the bacterium has potential antagonistic functions against high surfactin concentrations.14 Additionally, the reduced expression of the operon thiDFGO and tenAI, which are thiamine biosynthesis genes (ko02020), indicates that mutant strain LG3145 produces less thiamine and other related substances after absorbing nutrients (Datas S6 and S7).

To verify the transcriptional profiling data obtained from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) (https://edu.majorbio.com), we performed quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time qPCR) analysis on the original RNA extracts (Figure 2E and Data S8). Although there were some differences in the fold-changes for several DEGs as determined by real-time qPCR and RNA-Seq, the general trends were consistent, thus supporting the credibility of the RNA-Seq data. These differences likely resulted from the use of different methods, which has been observed previously.15 Among the upregulated genes confirmed by real-time qPCR, ptsH and glpDK are involved in phosphocarrier protein HPr and glycerol metabolism, respectively. Furthermore, murA, which is a critical gene in the generation of UDP-N-acetylmuramic Acid (MurNAc), the precursor of peptidoglycan, is associated with dihydrostreptomycin 6-phosphate (C01221) (Figure 2C). The genes guaB and ribA are involved in the synthesis of riboflavin, and crtI is responsible for generating lycopene. Finally, srfA is the surfactin synthase gene, which was significantly upregulated in bacteria grown in GLY minimal medium (GYMM) (|log2FC| = 3.09). Among the downregulated genes verified by real-time qPCR, tenA, which encodes thiaminase in the thiamine metabolism pathway (ko00730), was significantly downregulated (Figure 2D). To verify the transcriptional profiling data obtained from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) (https://edu.majorbio.com), we performed quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time qPCR) analysis on the original RNA extracts (Figure 2E and Data S8). Although there were some differences in the fold-changes for several DEGs as determined by real-time qPCR and RNA-Seq, the general trends were consistent, thus supporting the credibility of the RNA-Seq data. These differences likely resulted from the use of different methods, which has been observed previously.15 Among the upregulated genes confirmed by real-time qPCR, ptsH and glpDK are involved in phosphocarrier protein HPr and glycerol metabolism, respectively.

Based on the analysis of the volcano plots, we generated two heat maps to visualize the expression levels of some significant compounds and genes (p value <0.05) in strain LG3145 cultivated in different media, as shown in Figure 3 (Datas S9 and S10). The heatmap of genes in strain LG3145 cultivated in GYMM is more prominently red in Figure 3B, and the corresponding metabolites show similar patterns in Figure 3A. For example, the levels of precursors of riboflavin production, such as R-5-P (C00199), ribotol (C00474), and reduced riboflavin (C01007), were significantly higher in GYMM, which correspond to the upregulated genes ribABDFH, ycsE, and nfsA. Additionally, phytofluene (C05414) and hydroxy-gamma-carotene (C15859) were also shown to be significantly increased in Figure 3A and correspond to the significantly upregulated genes ispADEFGH, crtI, dxr, and dxs in Figure 3B. These findings suggested that when strain LG3145 uses GLY as a carbon source, the expression levels of genes and corresponding metabolites are significantly higher than those of WT, and are equal to or higher than those when using GLU as a carbon source after UgRNA/Cas9 editing. These significant genes and metabolites are mainly involved in GLY transport and metabolism, purine metabolism, PPP, riboflavin, carotenoid, peptidoglycan (PGN), and surfactin synthesis pathways (p value <0.05), indicating that B. pumilus LG3145 has the potential to produce riboflavin, carotenoids, antibiotics, peptidoglycan, and other related compounds.Figure 3Schematic representation of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) corresponding to differential metabolites when strain LG3145 was grown using glycerol as the carbon source(A) Differential metabolite comparative analysis of strain LG3145 and the wild-type (WT) grown using glycerol (GLY) as the carbon source (Data S9).(B) DEGs between strain LG3145 grown in GLY minimal medium (GYMM), strain LG3145 grown in glucose minimal medium (GUMM), and the WT grown in GYMM (Data S10).

We manually reconstructed a partial metabolic network integrating the transcriptomic analysis of strain LG3145 and the wheat metabolome, as shown in Figures 4B and 4C. Transcriptomic data of strain LG3145 grown in GYMM revealed that the FPKM values of the glp operon, which includes the glycerol transporter gene (glpF), the glycerol kinase gene (glpK), and the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (glpD), increased from 217.8–5760.79 to 648.24–6213.75, suggesting enhanced GLY transport and metabolism. DNA sequencing results showed five mutation sites in the glp operon, including two transversions mutations, T/A and A/C, and three transition mutations with one C/T and two G/A, around the cre [0,0]_−190 and cre [1,0]−81 sites. The expression level of the phosphotransferase system (PTS) operon, ptsGHI, encoding PTS transporter subunits, the HPR protein, and PTS system enzyme I, also increased from 44.10–1527.95 to 132.04–3160.40. Sequencing of the ptsGHI operon revealed two cre-like sites at −31 and −66, with some transitions of internal C/T, T/G, and C/T and some mutations surrounding them. Another PTS glucose transporter gene, crr, which showed an improved FPKM value from 199.19 to 556.27, contained cre [2,0]_−330, with two transversions and two transitions. Overexpression of these three membrane transporter genes will enhance strain LG3145’s ability to absorb non-favorable carbon sources, such as GLY. For example, the cre site mutation of ptsH resulted in overexpression of the Hpr protein, and the amount of Hpr-His-p and Hpr-Ser-p increased simultaneously. The cre-like site mutations in the glp operon increased the expression of transporter gene (glpF), the glycerol kinase gene (glpD), and the more active phospho (p)-GlpK was induced by Hpr-P-His. Thus, more GLY enters the cell and is converted into glycerol-3p, which enters the glycolytic pathway after being converted into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). The PTS transport system has a similar regulatory mechanism, enabling other non-favorable carbon sources to enter carbohydrate metabolism, where they provide carbon skeletons and energy for subsequent metabolism. There are abundant non-preferred carbons in soil, such as unsaturated FAs.18 After relieving CCR effect on the transport system, these carbon sources can be fully utilized and enter glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the PPP.

Another PTS glucose transporter gene, crr, which showed an improved FPKM value from 199.19 to 556.27, contained cre [2,0]_−330, with two transversions and two transitions. Overexpression of these three membrane transporter genes will enhance strain LG3145’s ability to absorb non-favorable carbon sources, such as GLY. For example, the cre site mutation of ptsH resulted in overexpression of the Hpr protein, and the amount of Hpr-His-p and Hpr-Ser-p increased simultaneously. The cre-like site mutations in the glp operon increased the expression of transporter gene (glpF), the glycerol kinase gene (glpD), and the more active phospho (p)-GlpK was induced by Hpr-P-His. Thus, more GLY enters the cell and is converted into glycerol-3p, which enters the glycolytic pathway after being converted into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). The PTS transport system has a similar regulatory mechanism, enabling other non-favorable carbon sources to enter carbohydrate metabolism, where they provide carbon skeletons and energy for subsequent metabolism. There are abundant non-preferred carbons in soil, such as unsaturated FAs.18 After relieving CCR effect on the transport system, these carbon sources can be fully utilized and enter glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the PPP. We manually reconstructed a partial metabolic network integrating the transcriptomic analysis of strain LG3145 and the wheat metabolome, as shown in Figures 4B and 4C. Transcriptomic data of strain LG3145 grown in GYMM revealed that the FPKM values of the glp operon, which includes the glycerol transporter gene (glpF), the glycerol kinase gene (glpK), and the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (glpD), increased from 217.8–5760.79 to 648.24–6213.75, suggesting enhanced GLY transport and metabolism. DNA sequencing results showed five mutation sites in the glp operon, including two transversions mutations, T/A and A/C, and three transition mutations with one C/T and two G/A, around the cre [0,0]_−190 and cre [1,0]−81 sites. The expression level of the phosphotransferase system (PTS) operon, ptsGHI, encoding PTS transporter subunits, the HPR protein, and PTS system enzyme I, also increased from 44.10–1527.95 to 132.04–3160.40.

There are abundant non-preferred carbons in soil, such as unsaturated FAs.18 After relieving CCR effect on the transport system, these carbon sources can be fully utilized and enter glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the PPP. In glycolysis, mutations were observed in the fructose bisphosphate aldolase gene (fbaA) with two C/T transitions at the cre [0,2]_−261 site and one T/A mutation at the cre [2,0]_−276 point. The eno operon, which includes the enolase gene (eno), the phosphoglycerate mutase gene (gpm), the triose-phosphate isomerase gene (tpiA), and the phosphoglycerate kinase gene (pgk), has a cre [3,0]_ 211 upstream of pgk, with a G/A transition inside and three mutations downstream: C/A, C/T, and T/C. Transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of most glycolysis genes, such as fbaA, pgk, and pyk, resulting in increased carbon flow into other carbon catabolism pathways. Specifically, the expression levels of fbaA, pgk, and pyk increased significantly from 1415.99 to 3092.21, 659.73 to 1413.97, and 281.54 to 754.26, respectively. In the TCA cycle, the pyruvate dehydrogenase operon (pdhABC), containing a cre-like site at cre [2,0]_127, has an internal C/T transition. The FPKM of pdhABC increased from 892.22–1223.90 to 3166.93–3933.69, providing more building precursors for cellular metabolism, such as pyruvate, 3P-glyceraldehyde, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), and riboflavin-5-phosphate (R-5-P), which are used as construction precursors in purine metabolism and lycopene biosynthesis, respectively. In the PPP, fructose bisphosphate (FBP) is generated by DHAP through the FBP aldolase gene (fbaA), which has two cre-like sites cre [0,2]_−261 and cre [2,0]_−276 with three transversions and two transitions around them, resulting in an increased FPKM value of 1415.99–3092.21. FBP is converted to 4-P-erythrose by the transaldolase encoded by fsa, which has a point mutation at cre [1,0]_−59, resulting in an increased FPKM value of 1987.12–2999.40. Additionally, R-5-P is produced by the transketolase gene (tkt), which has a large number of mutations between or around two cre-like sites cre [2,0]_−212 and cre [0,1]_171, including five transitions, three transversions, and three insertions. The FPKM of tkt increased from 515.38 to 1764.62, leading to the production of more R-5-P and more PRPP as precursors for purine metabolism. Pyruvate and 3P-glyceraldehyde are used as substrates to generate (1S,2R)-D-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol (DMAPP) through the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis metabolic pathway under the action of the ispFGA gene, the FPKM of which was significantly increased 48.05–333.10 to 164.85–960.12, respectively. DMAPP enters the metabolic pathway of carotenoid biosynthesis and generates lycopene under the effect of the crt operon, in which the phytoene desaturase gene, crtP, has a large number of mutations between cre [2,0]_−71 and cre [2,0]_−165, including one transversion C/G and two transitions CG/TA inside the cre-like sites. The FPKM of crtP increased from 39.31 to 257.90. The crtNIM operon, with three cre-like sites cre [2,0]_−145, cre [0,2]_273, and cre [2,0]_−389, has many mutations, including ten transitions, six transversions, and one insertion mutation, resulting in an increased FPKM value of 104.31–449.95 to 363.05–1346.83. For the other metabolic pathway, PRPP enters purine metabolism under the regulation of the pur gene family, whose expression levels were significantly upregulated from 85.39 to 455.21 to 129.33–988.48. The guaB gene, responsible for the conversion of IMP to GMP, has a transition G/A mutation located upstream of the cre-like site cre [1,0]_−159, and its FPKM value increased from 443.89 to 2572.01. R-5-P and GTP, serving as precursors for riboflavin synthesis, enter the riboflavin metabolic pathway in a 1:2 ratio, and undergo seven reaction steps to generate riboflavin. The riboflavin synthesis pathway is regulated by the ribABDHE gene family, which plays a crucial role in controlling the rate of riboflavin production. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the ribBD operon contains a cre [0,2]_58 with one transition G/A mutation and three transitions, four transversions, and one insertion mutation in its vicinity. In addition, the ribA gene harbors a cre [0,2]_−83 with a consecutive mutation of four bases AGTA/TCCT inside the cre-like site, as well as two deletion mutations nearby. The FPKM values of ribA, ribB, and ribD genes increased significantly from 130.01 to 1460.14, 122.27 to 281.50, and 16.26 to 236.30, respectively (Figure S2 and Data S11). In glycolysis, mutations were observed in the fructose bisphosphate aldolase gene (fbaA) with two C/T transitions at the cre [0,2]_−261 site and one T/A mutation at the cre [2,0]_−276 point.

In the metabolic network of the wheat metabolism data presented in Figure 4C, we observed a significant increase in the components of porphyrin metabolism (ko00860), including hydroxymethylbilane (C01024), protoporphyrin (C02191), divinylprotoporphyrin (C11831), 7-hydroxychlorophyllide (C16540), and phytophysin a (C05797) (Data S12). Porphyrin is a fundamental molecular structural component of chlorophyll, which plays a pivotal role in plant photosynthesis. Therefore, as shown in Figure 4A, strain LG3145-RI-treated seedlings showed a higher biomass than that of the non-inoculated wheat. Furthermore, levels of metabolites such as 3P-glycerate, L-aspartate, and L-alanine in the Calvin-Benson and C4-dicarboxylic acid cycle were significantly increased, indicating that strain LG3145-RI-treated plants have an enhanced capacity for CO2 absorption and fixation. In the strain LG3145-RI treatment group, levels of amino acids such as Cys and Asp were significantly higher than in the WT-RI treatment group and non-inoculated plants. These amino acids enter into tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (ko00400), resulting in the production of indole complexes, such as indolepyruvate (C00331), (indol-3-yl) acetamide (C02693), and indole-3-acetaldehyde oxime (C02937), which are natural auxins in plants, promoting shoot tip formation.19 In addition, strain LG3145-RI treatment led to a significant improvement in zeatin biosynthesis (ko00908) and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (ko00900), resulting in higher chlorophyll d levels of a variety of zeatin complexes, such as cis-zeatin riboside (C16449), trans-zeatin riboside (C16431), and trans-zeatin-glucoside (C16443). Zeatin is a member of the cytokinin family, which comprises a class of plant hormones involved in plant growth and development. The ability of strain LG3145 to promote plant growth might be derived from its capacity to produce more pigments and utilize non-preferred carbon in the soil, thereby stimulating plants to synthesize more porphyrins, zeatin, indole, and other compounds.

In soilless wheat cultivation experiments, B. pumilus LG3145-RI treatment significantly reduced the damage to the wheat shoot and root architecture, and showed high biocontrol efficacy against Fusarium graminearum, as demonstrated in Figure 5A (Data S13).20 The root and shoot lengths of strain LG3145-treated plants were longer and healthier than those of non-inoculated wheat, measuring approximately ∼13.4 cm and ∼25.4 cm, respectively. We found that strain LG3145 induced resistance against other fungal pathogens, such as Rhizoctonia solani Kühn, Botrytis cinerea Pers, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium moniliforme Sheld, Helminthosporium turcicum Pass, and Stemphylium solani Weber (Figure S4; Table S4). The average inhibition reached 67%. The photomicrographs shown in Figure 6A indicate that the pathogenic fungal hyphae were hydrolyzed by strain LG3145.Figure 5Metabolic pathway analysis of how strain LG3145 assists wheat to resist plant pathogens(A) Effect of strain LG3145-root irrigation (RI) treatment on wheat infected by F. graminearum, with non-inoculated wheat infected by F. graminearum as the control (CK).(B) The metabolic network of antibiotic substances produced by strain LG3145 was reconstructed based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis.

We further investigated the antibiotic synthesis pathway of B. pumilus LG3145 through heat-mapping of individual gene expression levels, as shown in Figure 5B.21 As previously discussed, overexpression of PTS transport system-related genes enhanced strain LG3145’s absorption of carbon sources to produce more fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) in glycolysis, after which F6P enters amino sugar metabolism (ko00520) to synthesize UDP-GlcNAc via the glm gene family and UDP-MurNAc by the mur and pbp gene clusters. The expression levels of glm, mur, and pbp were significantly upregulated, with glmU increasing from 206.16 to 429.41, murA increasing from 1692.01 to 1925.89, and pbp increasing from 108.84 to 174.50. Several mutations were identified in the cre-like sites of these key genes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis in the LG3145 mutant strain. Specifically, glmM with cre [3,0]_−191 exhibited a T deletion and a G/A transition mutation, while glmS has a T/C transition in cre [1,0]_175, and glmU with cre [0,2]_−157 had four transitions, one transversion, and a deletion of A around cre [0,2]_−157. The murGB operon also had cre-like sites, including, cre [2,0]_−190, cre [2,0]_−161, and cre [2,0]_−110, which exhibited three transversions and three transitions. The FPKM values of murGB increased significantly from 77.09 and 139.92 to 276.13 and 295.23. Similarly, murE, with a G/A transition inside and four transversions around the cre [3,0]_193 site, showed a significant increase in FPKM from 81.80 to 227.39. Mutations were also identified at the cre-like sites of murA, murD, and murC, resulting in an upregulation of their FPKM values from 1692.01 to 1925.89, 117.60 to 194.32, and 410.62 to 438.15, respectively. These mutations ultimately led to a substantial increase in peptidoglycan production in strain LG3145 and facilitated the formation of polysaccharide capsules, which aided the attachment of strain LG3145 to wheat roots. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the root cross-section in Figure 6B confirmed the abundance of attached strain LG3145 cells.

In the alternative branch of the PPP, the 4p-Erythrosine produced in PPP enters the physalalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis pathway (ko00400). The FPKM values of the aro gene family for chorismate synthesis were upregulated, including aroG from 2692.28 to 3876.75, aroA from 524.11 to 848.06, and aroBC from 157.82 to 445.17, which led to an increased amount of chorismate entering the siderophore biosynthetic pathway (ko01053). Furthermore, the bacilysin and myxochelin synthase gene family, the bac operon, and the pheB gene in the bacilysin biosynthesis pathway (ko00998) also exhibited higher expression, with bacA increasing from 34.50 to 97.23, bacB from 25.80 to 186.91, and pheB from 73.68 to 277.86.22 The expression of the mxc operon, comprising myxochelin precursor synthase genes, also increased from 1.8 to 21.92.23 These operons or genes possess some point mutations at their cre-like sites in their upstream sequences, which correlated with their increased expression (Figure S2).

The metabolites of strain LG3145 in GYMM exhibited distinct absorption peaks at 4.85, 12.04, and 12.15 min, which were not observed in the WT. MS analysis of the 12.04 min peak indicated the presence of surfactin homologs with m/z = 1034.6840 and 1035.6748, as shown in Figure S5. Furthermore, the other two peaks were identified using the mzCloud MS database as myxochelin B and lycopene. Further analysis of the UPLC-MS raw data also revealed the presence of bacilysin and riboflavin. (Data S6). In addition, the retention times of surfactin from strain LG3145 were identical to those of the standard surfactin from TargetMol (Figure S6). The maximum concentration of surfactin at 72 h was nearly 1.75 g/L. The MS fragments of surfactin produced by strain LG3145 agreed with those of previous reports (Figure S7).24 The metabolites of strain LG3145 in GYMM exhibited distinct absorption peaks at 4.85, 12.04, and 12.15 min, which were not observed in the WT.

In addition, the gene expression levels in the leucine and valine metabolism pathway, including ilvBCDEH and leuAB, were significantly upregulated (p value <0.01).

As a result, all the precursors required for surfactin biosynthesis in GYMM, namely L-Val, L-Leu, L-Asp, L-Glu, and FA, were increased compared with those in the WT strain, and were even higher than in strain LG3145 when using glucose as the carbon source.

Transcriptome analysis revealed that the FPKM values of the surfactin synthesis operon were also significantly increased (p value <0.01), such as srfAA (increased to 379.20), srfAB (increased to 547.11), srfAC (increased from 135.76 to 662.83), and the thioesterase gene (srfAD) (increased from 30.81 to 394.44). The FPKM value of the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene (sfp) increased from 15.95 to 46.60.25 Moreover, we identified some point mutations at the upstream region of the srfA operon, and DNA sequencing indicated three transitional mutations around the cre [1,0]_−6, in which G/A and A/G occurred inside the site. Furthermore, transcriptome profiling showed changes in the expression of some genes involved in two-component signal transduction systems (ko02020), such as members of the lia family, which are responsible for self-resistance and were all significantly upregulated (p value <0.01). DNA sequencing revealed many mutations around cre [0,2]_−143 and cre [0,1]_−113. Hence, surfactin or bacilysin produced by strain LG3145 stimulated higher levels of histidine kinase (liaS) and transcriptional regulator (liaR), resulting in increased expression of the lia family.26 Additionally, in the quorum sensing system (ko02024), the positive regulator genes, comQ, opp, and sop of the srfA operon were upregulated,27 while the negative regulator gene, rapA, decreased significantly from 133.92 to 20.06.28,29,30 These changes are beneficial for high surfactin production. To investigate the mechanism of plant pathogen resistance induced by B. pumilus LG3145, we reconstructed the metabolic network using a compounds heatmap based on the comparative metabolomics data of strain LG3145-RI-treated and non-treated plants infected with F. graminearum,31 as depicted in Figure 5C (Data S14).

Notably, significant differentially abundant compounds (p value <0.05, |log2 FC| ≥ 1) were observed for most primary metabolites in the unsaturated FA biosynthesis pathway (ko01040), such as oleic acid (C00712) and 3-hexenal (C16310), marked in the volcano chart of Figure 7A. This pathway was also significantly enriched according to Figure 7B (p value <0.05), indicating that these FAs might not be preferred carbon sources for strain LG3145, which instead utilizes them to produce antibacterial substances, surfactants, bacilysin, and myxohelin B, which assist wheat to resist F. graminearum infection. Additionally, the amino acid metabolites in wheat treated by B. pumilus LG3145 showed a significant increase, as observed in the enriched pathway of tyrosine metabolism (ko00350) in Figure 7B, which can provide precursors for isoquinoline alkaloid and anthocyanin biosynthesis.32 Anthocyanin biosynthesis (ko00942) was the most significantly enriched pathway in Figure 7B (p value = 0.00), in which kaempferol 3-sophorotropioside (C12635), pelargonidin-5-glucoside-3-sambubioside (C20492), malonylshisonin (C16299), and albireodelphin (C16354), which are biological flavonoids, have the ability to scavenge free radicals and provide antioxidation functions.33 Isoquinoline alkaloid is a plant alkaloid derived from tyrosine metabolism (ko00350, p value = 0.01), which is involved in various biological activities.34 N-methylnicotinate (C01004) and dihydroxy-methylcanadine (C21587) are examples of isoquinoline skeleton components upregulated in strain LG3145,35,36 which also possess strong pharmacological and antibacterial properties (Datas S15 and S16).Figure 7Metabolic changes in wheat shoots infected by F graminearum under strain LG3145 stress at the seedling stage(A) Differential metabolites analysis of wheat shoots under strain LG3145 stress using a volcano chart.

Conclusions Conclusions Conclusions In this study, we conferred dual-plant-benefit properties on wild-type B. pumilus, which was isolated from intensively cultivated soil, by perturbation of its genome-scale cre-like sequences. The presence of cre-mediated global regulation in gram-positive bacteria has been known since 1990. However, the universal distribution and sequence diversity of this cis-acting carbon repression element pose a significant obstacle to utilizing site-directed mutagenesis to reconstruct metabolic networks. DNA sequencing demonstrated that the UgRNA/Cas9 gene editing system can effectively edit multiple cre-like sites simultaneously, most of which occurred around [1,0], [2,0], and [0,2] cre-like sites, especially in srfA, ptsG, glpFKD, bacABCDF, murABCDEG, and ribABD, which contained genes encoding surfactin, myxochelin B, and bacilysin, with good antibacterial performance. When colonizing the wheat rhizosphere, strain LG3145 significantly increased the plant height and fresh weight, while improving stem rot resistance.

When colonizing the wheat rhizosphere, strain LG3145 significantly increased the plant height and fresh weight, while improving stem rot resistance. Transcriptomic profiling of 3505 genes and metabolomic data assayed using ultra UPLC-MS revealed that the mutations of cre-like sequences in strain LG3145 relieved the CCR effect for most genes, allowing the bacterium to convert rhizodeposits, e.g., FAs produced by plants, into secondary metabolites, such as pigments, PG, surfactant, bacilysin, and myxochelin B through the pentose phosphate and amino acid metabolism pathways. In turn, this enabled strain LG3145 to adhere to the root more easily, and the plant provides more FA to the bacterium, ultimately promoting plant growth and enhancing resistance against pathogens. Our findings suggested that the mutations of cre-like sequences play a crucial role in the overall transcription and metabolism of B. pumilus LG3145, and restoration of its plant-beneficial function is closely related to cre-mediated global regulation.

Limitations of the study Limitations of the study Limitations of the study The non-specific gRNA/Cas9 system used here successfully edited the cres sites of multiple genes simultaneously, but there were still many details that need to be considered in the design of UgRNA. We still use the traditional method combined with manual adjustment of similarity to design the UgRNA which is time-consuming and laborious. Future users can develop computer-aided algorithm based on their edit target specificities for making more precise similarity ratios of UgRNA. We also recognize that identifying potential causal genes involved in CCR was still very limited. The SNP-based summary statistics showed many mutation loci in the promoters, which were not discussed due to the large amount of data. We believe these mutation loci also contributed to the LG3145 strain to restore agricultural functions. In addition, field experiments need to be conducted in future studies to further verify the results of soilless and indoor experiments. The method used in this study to restore PGPR’s function is more suitable for gram-positive bacteria. We need to explore more editing targets and methods for gram-negative PGPR bacteria and fungi.

In the indoor experiment, the organic soil was moistened using 100 mL of ddH2O and kept at approximately 60% wetness at a temperature of approximately 25°C each day. After seed germination, the strain LG3145 spore suspension was sprayed around the germinated plants once every two days. The plant height was recorded every day and the fresh weight and the root lengths were recorded after nine days of cultivation. The non-inoculation (CK1) and WT spore suspension treatment (CK2) were used as the controls. In the disease resistance experiment, when the wheat seeds had germinated for approximately one week at 25°C, an equal number of hyphae from F. graminearum were inoculated to infect the wheat embryos. The next day, strain LG3145 spore suspensions were sprayed around the embryos as the experimental group (EG), and an equal amount of water and the WT strain were used as controls CK1 and CK2, respectively. The growth of wheat was observed and recorded, and images of wheat shoots were acquired 10 days later. Surfactin production assays Surfactin production assays Surfactin production assays Surfactin production assays A modified method was utilized to purify and detect crude surfactin from B. pumilus LG314551. B. pumilus LG3145 was cultivated in GYMM at 35°C and 125 rpm for 72 h. Then, 60 mL of cell culture broth was taken and adjusted to pH 2.0 using 6M HCl, followed by centrifugation to remove the supernatant (10,000 × g, 30 min). The pellet was then re-dissolved in 1 mL of 100% CH3OH and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 30 min) to remove the cell residues. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay was performed using an SHIMADZU-CTO-20A HPLC with photo diode array (PDA) detector (Shanghai, China) and an XAqua C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm 100 A). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (ddH2O) and solvent B (100% CH3OH), and a binary solvent delivery system was used. A linear biphasic gradient of 85% solvent B over 10 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a column temperature of 40°C was used. The injection volume was 25 μL, monitored at 210 nm. The surfactin concentration was quantified using a calibration curve constructed using surfactin standards (CAS: 24730-31-2 TargetMol Chemicals, Boston, MA, USA). The experiment was performed in triplicate. The same samples (5 μL) were analyzed using an SHIMADZU-LCMS-8045 with a Q3. detector (Shanghai, China). Mass spectrometry detection was performed on a Shim-pack GIST C18 column (2 μm, 2.1 mm × 50 mm (High Strength Silica (HSS)); SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan) using a linear biphasic gradient elution with 90% CH3OH (100%) and ddH2O at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The detection time was 20 min, and the m/z range was from 400 to 1300. A modified method was utilized to purify and detect crude surfactin from B. pumilus LG314551.
