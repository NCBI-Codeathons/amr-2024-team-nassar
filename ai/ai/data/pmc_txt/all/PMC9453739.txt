 The pairing of analytical chemistry with genomic techniques
represents
a new wave in natural product chemistry. With an increase in the availability
of sequencing and assembly of microbial genomes, interrogation into
the biosynthetic capability of producers with valuable secondary metabolites
is possible. However, without the development of robust, accessible,
and medium to high throughput tools, the bottleneck in pairing metabolic
potential and compound isolation will continue. Several innovative
approaches have proven useful in the nascent stages of microbial genome-informed
drug discovery. Here, we consider a number of these approaches which
have led to prioritization of strain targets and have mitigated rediscovery
rates. Likewise, we discuss integration of principles of comparative
evolutionary studies and retrobiosynthetic predictions to better understand
biosynthetic mechanistic details and link genome sequence to structure.
Lastly, we discuss advances in engineering, chemistry, and molecular
networking and other computational approaches that are accelerating
progress in the field of omic-informed natural product drug discovery.
Together, these strategies enhance the synergy between cutting edge
omics, chemical characterization, and computational technologies that
pitch the discovery of natural products with pharmaceutical and other
potential applications to the crest of the wave where progress is
ripe for rapid advances. Genomic approaches to drug discovery
have not only focused on the study of human genomes to better understand
protein targets, cellular cascades, drug resistance, epigenetics,
and their implications on human disease to further refine drug discovery
efforts,1,2 but genomic studies have revealed a vast
repertoire of diversity in microbial metabolic innovation which can
also be paired with metabolomics for the study of microbially produced
secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites have garnered great interest
as potential pharmaceuticals as the diverse chemical scaffolds are
well suited for biological targets.3 Over
50% of FDA-approved medications have been sourced directly from or
inspired by nature.4 Historically,
methods of natural product isolation and characterization
relied heavily on extraction of secondary metabolites from both microorganisms
and macroorganisms requiring time-intensive analytical procedures
for isolation and compound characterization. Over time, several barriers
to natural product discovery have been identified, such as high rediscovery
rates and the potential ecological impact of mass field collections,
with implications on the sustainability of the source. Technological
advances have now ameliorated most of these concerns. For example,
omics techniques have been harnessed to prioritize samples, quickly
identify metabolites of interest, and utilize genomic information
to inform natural product discovery.5−7 Technological advances
also enhance the potential for a more sustainable exploration of nature’s
chemical wealth and for creation of an ongoing supply of compounds
through biotechnology. One of the primary ways that genomics
is integrated with drug discovery
of natural products is by the identification of biosynthetic gene
clusters (BGCs). BGCs encode for the enzymatic machinery, ranging
in organization from single iteratively acting enzymes to multidomain
megaenzymes with numerous catalytic sites, that are responsible for
the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.8 These discrete genomic elements are similar to, but evolutionarily
divergent from, genes involved in primary metabolism (i.e., polyketide
synthases are likely derive from fatty acid synthases). The genes
have been evolutionarily repurposed to produce an array of architecturally
diverse compounds under tight stereochemical controls with a strong
affinity toward biological targets. BGCs can be horizontally transferred
from one organism to another, a phenomenon that can be identified
through phylogenetic analysis, as the evolutionary history of clustered
elements within a BGC can be quite divergent from the remainder of
the genome.9,10 Today, there is a wealth
of publicly accessible databases tailored
to the fields of genomics and natural products, some linking the two
disciplines, and several of which are community-curated with ongoing
contributions that serve as data resources (Table 1). Data sourced from these repositories are
often used in comparative analyses with a multitude of software tools
resulting in powerful analyses that are becoming more integrated due
to improvements in cross-communication between the fields and resources
available (Table 1).
There were significant barriers in the past with databases having
little crosstalk, particularly between different disciplines and technologies
(e.g., biosynthetic gene cluster data with metabolomic profiles).
This divide demonstrates the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations
and community curation in natural product chemistry and is consistent
with the movement toward open-source software that evolves and incorporates
new tools and strategies. List of Resources and Accompanying

drug discovery
remains a critical element of the field. Traditional methods for isolation
and characterization of natural products, notably the use of chromatography,
mass spectrometry (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), are
a mainstay for structure isolation and characterization. When combined
with genome and metagenome-informed approaches, analytical techniques
are being used to advance the technological frontier of drug discovery.
Examples of these approaches are discussed below, and new approaches
are proposed that will continue to merge the fields of genomics and
metabolomics in a synergistic way to enhance natural product discovery

a common language
and data standard to communicate the biosynthetic gene cluster data
and associated chemistry. The standard, led by Kautsar and colleagues
and referred to as the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene
Cluster (MIBiG),19 is accompanied by a
repository which houses nearly 2000 BGCs as of early 2022 (Figure 2). This resource
allows for manual curation and annotation by the natural product community
and the MIBiG developers. It serves as a centralized space to deposit
and access valuable data about BGCs including information on enzymatic
features, protein sequences, taxonomic origins, and associated chemical
structures. MIBiG has also been incorporated into antiSMASH15 and is used to screen (meta)genomes submitted
for BGC analysis for similarity to known BGCs in the MIBiG database.
Beyond identification of identical BGCs and dereplication, the referencing
of the MIBiG repository within antiSMASH provides a percent identity
score for submitted BGCs affording the opportunity to utilize the
similarities in gene structure to target novel metabolites. On the
basis of the differences in the gene sequence, differences in chemical
structure can be inferred. This allows for rapid dereplication as
part of the antiSMASH genome mining pipeline. Metagenomic libraries
can therefore be efficiently interrogated for the presence of BGCs
and evaluated for homologies to known BGCs. This strategy can guide
prioritization of BGCs of interest for further investigation with
cultivation or biotechnological measures. Recently, the scientific community has developed

to be more biosynthetically talented than others. However, biosynthetic
potential, the likelihood that secondary metabolites can be produced,
is understudied in many lineages. This makes the prospect for novelty
high, particularly in poorly studied lineages, many of which have

novelty remains to be discovered even in more familiar lineages including
two distinct bacterial groups that are known to be particularly rich
in BGCs and known to produce bioactive compounds (filamentous cyanobacteria
and Streptomyces). For example, Leão and colleagues
characterized the biosynthetic potential based on BGC classes and
resultant metabolites from tropical filamentous marine cyanobacteria.24 They suggested that “natural product
diversity hotspots” should be prioritized, while ecosystems
or niches with low beta-diversity when paired with low numbers of
BGCs were deemed to be more likely to result in rediscovery of known
natural products.24 Many of the FDA-approved
anti-infectives are derived from actinomycetes, specifically Streptomyces spp. There are several examples applying Streptomyces-targeted investigation that are yielding novelty.

through the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS).29 The software tool pairs algorithms to determine
phylogenic discrepancies which may indicate horizontal gene transfer,
with additional features such as gene duplication and proximity to
resistance markers that can be used to highlight those clusters that
may have an increased likelihood of producing anti-infective bioactive
molecules.29 Although the initial version
was focused primarily on actinobacterial genomes, the release of the
second ARTS version in 2020 expanded the tool to allow for analysis
of genomes from all bacterial taxa as well as from metagenomic data.
Since bacteria have been found to harbor resistance genes integral
to the prevention of self-toxicity in genomic proximity to the secondary
metabolites they produce,30 this strategy
is a way to streamline genomic-based antibiotic discovery. These mechanisms

modification, use of efflux pumps, and self-resistant protein variants.30 Manual interrogation for specific markers not
yet included in ARTS 2.0 can be used to complement and expand the

glycosyl transferases can be used for pro-drug formation and self-protection.31,32 Another valuable approach has been introduced by Ziemert and colleagues
through the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS).29 The software tool pairs algorithms to determine
phylogenic discrepancies which may indicate horizontal gene transfer,
with additional features such as gene duplication and proximity to
resistance markers that can be used to highlight those clusters that
may have an increased likelihood of producing anti-infective bioactive
molecules.29 Although the initial version
was focused primarily on actinobacterial genomes, the release of the
second ARTS version in 2020 expanded the tool to allow for analysis
of genomes from all bacterial taxa as well as from metagenomic data.

process of determining likely biosynthetic steps based on biosynthetic
subunit precursors that comprise the molecule of interest. This analysis
can be used to identify if the BGC responsible for a compound of interest
is reasonable, particularly when colinear arrangement of genes and
enzymatic activity are suspected in the biosynthesis of a given product.
This type of modular organization is often seen in Type I PKS, NRPS,
and hybrid PKS–NRPS systems. The secondary metabolites that
result from these classes of BGCs generally demonstrate colinearity,
meaning that the genomic code, enzymatic domains, and resultant chemical
structures are closely linked, conferring a degree of predictability.36−38 This colinearity can be harnessed to enhance drug discovery efforts.
Retrobiosynthetic strategies can predict the specific enzymatic domains
that would be responsible for creating a particular structural feature
or to match a known structure to the series of enzymatic domains within
a BGC. Modular organization of PKS and NRP systems makes them conducive

no specific limitations to broad adoption
of the approaches and technologies introduced here. Interdisciplinary
training across biological and chemical sciences is essential, as
are strong computational skills. Likewise, the value of cross-disciplinary
collaboration can add paramount value to these studies. However, there
are a number of considerations to the selection of an approach including
the type of genomic data available and the research objective. Many
of the tools and strategies discussed above are amenable to input
from various sequence types, including whole genomes, partial genomes,
metagenomic assemblies, and metagenome-assembled genomes or single
amplified genomes. When considering “big data” and integrating
different data types, the source, type, and completeness must be considered
in any analyses. Completeness can be problematic in cases of phylogenetic
novelty that can influence annotation accuracy and upon analysis of
host-associated microbes which may have undergone genomic streamlining.
Another barrier to analysis occurs during genome assembly, in which
repetitive modules that are often seen in biosynthetic gene clusters
can make assembling the sequences challenging. Long-read technologies
and specialized assembly pipelines can help overcome this obstacle.41 In principle, there are

BGCs presents a challenge
to linking sequence to product and is a currently active area of research.71−73 Identification of an interesting BGC does not necessarily indicate
that the cluster is translated and the product biosynthesized under
laboratory culture conditions. At times, unsilencing of cryptic BGCs
can be promoted through the one strain–many compounds (OSMAC)
approach74 or coculture experiments; however,
at other times, this is an issue best solved at the genome level through
genetic engineering of promoters to control expression in addition
to screening at the levels of gene and protein expression as well. Transcriptional regulation of cryptic

and Type II PKSs, are inherently more challenging to link to their
products due to a lack of colinearity which limits structural prediction.
Likewise, nascent understanding of enzymatic subtypes that catalyze
specific reactions during biosynthesis limit retrobiosynthetic predictions. As mentioned in brief above, some BGCs, such as terpene synthases

is that cultivation efforts are not always successful, or if isolated
in pure culture, growth rates can be suboptimal for scale-up. Along
the same lines, heterologous host suitability is an additional consideration.
Finding a genetically tractable host can be difficult—particularly
for novel lineages. The repertoire of heterologous hosts is dominated
by Streptomyces strains, although is expanding and
currently includes strains of E. coli, Saccharomonspora sp., Salinospora sp., Pseudoaltermonas sp., Anabaena sp., Synechococcus sp., among others.75 Another hurdle to drug development directly from microbial sources

are also analytical challenges for compound isolation

analogues identified in a molecular network may preclude subsequent
characterization of the proposed analogue. Lastly, there

of genomic-based workflows for microbial natural product
drug discovery is advancing the field. Genomic approaches for prioritization
of bacteria enriched with biosynthetic pathways and deprioritization
of BGCs known to produce previously identified compounds can help
overcome the hurdle of high rediscovery rates of natural products.
Taxonomy, phylogenetics, and the use of coevolutionary principles
can aid in prioritization of BGCs. Additionally, in order to address
orphan gene clusters or compounds that have not yet been linked to
BGCs, retrobiosynthetic principles can be applied. Analytical metabolomic
tools remain a mainstay in the natural product drug discovery workflows.
Molecular networking is proving to be a powerful tool in identification
of analogues produced by wild-type bacteria as well as from those
engineered to express BGCs of high interest. The linking of paired
genomic and metabolomic data sets will be conducive to large-scale
and small-scale comparative and integrative analyses as natural product
drug discovery efforts continue. The rise

drug discovery continues to uncover

The creation of community-curated repositories for large-scale natural

that will continue to promote scientific advancement. As genome sequencing
continues to become more accessible and more affordable, large-scale
sequencing efforts will expand. With this expansion comes opportunity
to pair analytical techniques for natural product discovery with genome-based
approaches. Many of the approaches are currently microbially based;
however, there is need to not only harness the current approaches
with prokaryotes but also to extend into eukaryotic systems. The field of natural product

natural products is the issue of supply. The convergence of bacterial
genomics, specifically biosynthetic gene clusters, in the drug discovery
pipeline allows this issue to be addressed by cultivation or heterologous
expression. Barriers beyond limited compound supply include high rediscovery
rates and potential ecological impacts of large sample collections.
These hurdles can be circumnavigated and the deleterious effect ameliorated
