Background Background Nocamycins I and II, produced by the rare actinomycete Saccharothrix syringae, belong to the tetramic acid family natural products. Nocamycins show potent antimicrobial activity and they hold great potential for antibacterial agent design. However, up to now, little is known about the exact biosynthetic mechanism of nocamycin.

Nocamycins show potent antimicrobial activity and they hold great potential for antibacterial agent design. However, up to now, little is known about the exact biosynthetic mechanism of nocamycin. Results Results In this report, we identified the gene cluster responsible for nocamycin biosynthesis from S. syringae and generated new nocamycin derivatives by manipulating its gene cluster. The biosynthetic gene cluster for nocamycin contains a 61 kb DNA locus, consisting of 21 open reading frames (ORFs). Five type I polyketide synthases (NcmAI, NcmAII, NcmAIII, NcmAIV, NcmAV) and a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NcmB) are proposed to be involved in synthesis of the backbone structure, a Dieckmann cyclase NcmC catalyze the releasing of linear chain and the formation of tetramic acid moiety, five enzymes (NcmEDGOP) are related to post-tailoring steps, and five enzymes (NcmNJKIM) function as regulators. Targeted inactivation of ncmB led to nocamycin production being completely abolished, which demonstrates that this gene cluster is involved in nocamycin biosynthesis. To generate new nocamycin derivatives, the gene ncmG, encoding for a cytochrome P450 oxidase, was inactivated. Two new nocamycin derivatives nocamycin III and nocamycin IV were isolated from the ncmG deletion mutant strain and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data analyses. Based on bioinformatics analysis and new derivatives isolated from gene inactivation mutant strains, a biosynthetic pathway of nocamycins was proposed.

Keywords Background Background Nocamycins I and II (Fig. 1), isolated from the broth of Saccharothrix syringae NRRL B-16468 by Russian scientists in 1977, belong to the tetramic acid (2, 4-pyrrolidinedione) family natural products [1–3]. The original structural assignment of nocamycin I was incorrect and it was revised by a Japanese research group [4]. The Japanese research group reported two compounds Bu-2313A and Bu-2313B from the strain Microtetraspora caesia ATCC 31295 nearly at the same time [5]. Further structural elucidation showed that Bu-2313B was virtually identical to nocamycin I [4]. Beyond the common tetramic acid structure, a tricyclic ketal structure is another interesting motif in nocamycins. In terms of structural viewpoint, streptolydigin, tirandamycins and tirandalydigin are closely related to nocamycins (Fig. 1). Among these compounds, nocamycins I and II are unique because they have a fused oxolane ring system other than an oxirane (spiro or fused) ring in streptolydigin, tirandamycin and tirandalydigin.Fig. 1Structure of nocamycins and related compounds Nocamycins I and II (Fig. 1), isolated from the broth of Saccharothrix syringae NRRL B-16468 by Russian scientists in 1977, belong to the tetramic acid (2, 4-pyrrolidinedione) family natural products [1–3].

Inhibitions of anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium sp., Fusobacterium sp., Sphaerophorus sp. by nocamycins are particularly potent, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are in the range of 0.1–0.4 μg/mL [5–7]. Further in vivo experiments conducted in mice showed that nocamycin I is effective in protecting mice against B. fragilis A20928-1 and Clostridium perfingens A9635 when administered by both oral and subcutaneous routes [5]. In addition, nocamycins show antitumor effects [1]. Up to now, the exact antibacterial mold of action of nocamycins has not been investigated. The closely related compounds tirandamycin and streptolydigin are validated to be inhibitors of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), thus nocamycins are probably to be inhibitors of RNAP. In recent years, the molecular evidences for the structural basis of the RNAP interaction mechanism of this class of natural products have been disclosed by co-crystal complexes of streptolydigin with RNAPs from Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus [8, 9]. The key affinities of both bicyclic ketal and tetramic acid structures with RNAPs have been observed from the co-crystal complexes, indicating the substitution or modification in these two structural motifs is critical for the biological activity [8, 9]. Meanwhile, results of antibacterial activities of streptolydigin, tirandamycin and their congeners also demonstrated that the two featured motifs are closely related to the activity of this family of natural products [10–12].

Meanwhile, results of antibacterial activities of streptolydigin, tirandamycin and their congeners also demonstrated that the two featured motifs are closely related to the activity of this family of natural products [10–12]. The intriguing structure, action mold and biological activity of this small class of natural products attract more and more attentions from biochemists. So far, the gene clusters responsible for tirandamycin and streptolydigin biosynthesis have been identified from three different Streptomyces species by Sherman, Salas and Ju group, respectively [10, 13, 14]. Both tirandamycins and streptolydigin are assembled by hybrid iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS). The functions of a number of genes related to post-tailoring, regulator and resistance involved in tirandamycin and streptolydigin biosynthetic pathway have been fully elucidated [12, 13, 15–20]. Some streptolydigin derivatives were generated by using combinatorial biosynthesis method [10]. In streptolydigin and tirandamycins biosynthetic pathway, a uniform strategy is employed to catalyze the formation of tetramic acid moiety [21]. The mechanism of bicyclic ketal structure formation remains unclear since no related gene candidates have been discovered in the two gene clusters. To fully understand the biosynthetic pathway of nocamycins, provide insights into the formation of bicyclic ketal structure and generate diversified nocamycin derivatives, we started to identify the nocamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from S. syringae NRRL B-16468. Here, we report the identification of nocamycin biosynthetic gene cluster and new nocamycin derivatives generated by manipulating the gene cluster.

Generation of S. syringae mutant strains Generation of S. syringae mutant strains Generation of S. syringae mutant strains λ-RED recombination technology was employed to inactivate the target gene ncmB, ncmL and ncmG according to literature previously reported [14]. The primer pairs used for PCR-targeting are listed in Table 2. The fragment oriT/acc(3)IV cassette was used to replace partial gene region of ncmB or ncmL in p5-C-9 to generate cosmid pMoS1001 (ΔncmB) or pMoS1002 (ΔncmL). For ncmG, partial gene region was replaced by fragment oriT/acc(3)IV cassette in cosmid p2-H-12 and plasmid pMoS1003(ΔncmG) were generated. After verified by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion analysis, the correct mutated cosmids were introduced into E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 and conjugated with wild type S. syringae spores. The wild type S. syringae spores were germinated in LB medium for 4–5 h at 30 °C, 200 rpm.

Results Results Sequencing and identification of nocamycin gene cluster Sequencing and identification of nocamycin gene cluster Sequencing and identification of nocamycin gene cluster Saccharothrix syringae NRRL B-16468 genome was shotgun sequenced by Hiseq4000 technologies and the sequence reads were assembled into 10.8 Mb nucleotides. Then, S. syringae NRRL B-16468 genome data was analyzed by using online antiSMASH tool [27]. AntiSMASH analysis results demonstrated that a hybrid PKS-NRPS gene cluster designated as Ncm seems to be the candidate responsible for nocamycin biosynthesis since it shows high similarity to tirandamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. In the Ncm gene cluster, some deduced gene products such as NcmC, NcmE, NcmF and NcmB show high similarity to TrdC, TrdE, TrdF and TrdB originated from tirandamycin biosynthetic pathway, respectively [14]. Thus, we assumed that this cluster is probably involved in nocamycin biosynthesis. We then screened S. syringae genomic library by using PCR method with the primer pairs targeted at ncmG, ncmC and dehydratase (DH) domain at module 4. In total of eight positive cosmids were obtained. The eight cosmids were end-sequenced and two cosmids p2-H-12 and p5-H-9 were used for further gene inactivation experiments. To verify our hypothesis, a gene ncmB encoding a NRPS was inactivated to afford the strain S. syringae MoS-1001 (Additional file 1: Figure S1). HPLC analysis of the extract of S. syringae MoS-1001 fermentation broth revealed that S. syringae MoS-1001 failed to produce nocamycin I and II (Fig. 2I) completely, indicating ncmB’s involvement in nocamycin biosynthesis. This result also demonstrated this PKS-NRPS gene cluster is responsible for nocamycin biosynthesis. On basis of bioinformatics analysis, about 61 kb DNA locus consisted of 21 open reading frames (ORFs) whose deduced products are likely to be involved in nocamycin biosynthesis (Fig. 3; Table 3). Corresponding homologues and deduced function of each ncm gene are listed in Table 3. The sequence data of nocamycin biosynthesis in this study have been deposited in Genbank under accession number KY287782.Fig. 2HPLC analysis of S. syringae and its mutant strain. I ncmB deletion mutant strain S. syringae MoS1001; II ncmG deletion mutant strain S. syringae MoS1003; III ncmL deletion mutant strain S. syringae MoS1002; IV S. syringae wild type strain. 1, 2, 4, 5 represent for nocamycin I, II, III and IV, respectively

322KDO05396, Amycolatopsis mediterranei, 68/77%(2Fe–2S) ferredoxin Saccharothrix syringae NRRL B-16468 genome was shotgun sequenced by Hiseq4000 technologies and the sequence reads were assembled into 10.8 Mb nucleotides. Then, S. syringae NRRL B-16468 genome data was analyzed by using online antiSMASH tool [27]. AntiSMASH analysis results demonstrated that a hybrid PKS-NRPS gene cluster designated as Ncm seems to be the candidate responsible for nocamycin biosynthesis since it shows high similarity to tirandamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. In the Ncm gene cluster, some deduced gene products such as NcmC, NcmE, NcmF and NcmB show high similarity to TrdC, TrdE, TrdF and TrdB originated from tirandamycin biosynthetic pathway, respectively [14]. Thus, we assumed that this cluster is probably involved in nocamycin biosynthesis. We then screened S. syringae genomic library by using PCR method with the primer pairs targeted at ncmG, ncmC and dehydratase (DH) domain at module 4. In total of eight positive cosmids were obtained. The eight cosmids were end-sequenced and two cosmids p2-H-12 and p5-H-9 were used for further gene inactivation experiments. To verify our hypothesis, a gene ncmB encoding a NRPS was inactivated to afford the strain S. syringae MoS-1001 (Additional file 1: Figure S1). HPLC analysis of the extract of S. syringae MoS-1001 fermentation broth revealed that S. syringae MoS-1001 failed to produce nocamycin I and II (Fig. 2I) completely, indicating ncmB’s involvement in nocamycin biosynthesis. This result also demonstrated this PKS-NRPS gene cluster is responsible for nocamycin biosynthesis. On basis of bioinformatics analysis, about 61 kb DNA locus consisted of 21 open reading frames (ORFs) whose deduced products are likely to be involved in nocamycin biosynthesis (Fig. 3; Table 3). Corresponding homologues and deduced function of each ncm gene are listed in Table 3. The sequence data of nocamycin biosynthesis in this study have been deposited in Genbank under accession number KY287782.Fig. 2HPLC analysis of S. syringae and its mutant strain. I ncmB deletion mutant strain S. syringae MoS1001; II ncmG deletion mutant strain S. syringae MoS1003; III ncmL deletion mutant strain S. syringae MoS1002; IV S. syringae wild type strain. 1, 2, 4, 5 represent for nocamycin I, II, III and IV, respectively

Linear chain assembly and releasing Linear chain assembly and releasing Linear chain assembly and releasing Hybrid PKS-NRPS are employed to construct the backbone structure of nocamycin. Five type I PKS genes ncmAI, ncmAII, ncmAIII, ncmAIV and ncmAV transcribed in the same direction were identified in the gene cluster (Fig. 3). The deduced products of the five PKS genes were constituted by four, one, one, one and two modules respectively to assemble the polyketide backbone (Fig. 4). Each PKS module minimally contains ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT) and acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains. The conserved motifs from PKS modules in nocamycin gene cluster are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1. Except for loading module, M2 and M8, each module possess a ketoreductase (KR) domain with conserved active motif. KR domain in module M5 is the only KR domain contains the characteristic of A-type KRs, and all the other KR domains display the conserved motif characteristic for the B-type KRs [28]. A characteristic KSQ domain of loading module indicated that a malonoyl–CoA might be used to provide acetate as starter unit, and this phenomenon was observed in tirandamycin and streptolydigin gene clusters [10, 14]. As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 4, the AT domains in extension modules M3, M7 and M8 display conserved active motif specific for malonate-CoA incorporation [29, 30], whereas AT domains in extension modules M1, M2, M4, M5 and M6 show conserved active motif specific for methylmalonate-CoA incorporation [29, 30], which is in good agreement with the polyketide carbon skeleton. There are three DH domains with conserved active motif HXXXGXXXXP distributed in module M4, M6 and M7 [31].Fig. 4The putative biosynthetic pathway of nocamycins

TrdC and its analogues SlgC, KirHI have been determined as Dieckmann cyclases, and they catalyze the formation of tetramic acid or pyridone moiety [21]. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that NcmC also possesses the characteristic catalytic traid Cys-Asp-His (Additional file 1: Figure S4).

Genes involved in post-tailoring steps Genes involved in post-tailoring steps Genes involved in post-tailoring steps After linear chain released from PKS-NRPS and formation of tetramic acid moiety, several post tailoring processes including oxolane ring system, C-10 hydroxyl/ketone group, C-14 methoxycarbonyl group are required to synthesis nocamycin I. Within the identified gene cluster, there are six genes encoding two cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (ncmO and ncmG), one monooxygenase (ncmL), one carboxylate O-methyltransferase (ncmP), one short chain dehydrogenase (ncmD) and one glycoside hydrolase (ncmE) are likely to be involved in these steps.

The glycoside hydrolase NcmE shows identity to TrdE (60% identity/76% similarity) involved in tirandamycin biosynthesis [14]. In tirandamycin pathway, TrdE functions as a dehydratase and it is responsible for the formation of C11–C12 double bond [17]. Thus, we propose that NcmE is a dehydratase and it catalyzes the formation of C11–C12 double bond.

Since at least three oxidative tailoring steps, including the formation of tetrahydrofuran fused in bicyclic ketal structure, C-10 hydroxyl and C-14 carboxyl group are required, NcmG or NcmO is proposed to be bifunctional. Sequence alignments analysis revealed that NcmO and NcmG are distinct from the cytochrome P450 oxidases TrdI/TamI, SlgO1 and SlgO2 involved in tirandamycin or streptolydigin biosynthetic pathway [10, 15] (Additional file 1: Figure S6). The reason for this phenomenon may attribute to the different oxidative modification in bicyclic ketal structure of nocamycin, streptolydigin and tirandamycin.

Within nocamycin gene cluster, only ncmP encodes for a SAM-dependent carboxylate O-methyltransferase and it shows identity to NokK (44% identity/55% similarity) and NivG (43% identity/53% similarity).

Generally, oxygenation modification is a vital approach to improve bioactivity of parent molecule. To obtain more nocamycin derivatives, we inactivated ncmG by λ-RED/ET technology and generated ΔncmG mutant strain S. syringae MoS1003 (Additional file 1: Figure S3). HPLC analysis revealed that S. syringae MoS1003 abolished nocamycin I and nocamycin II production completely and two new peaks with similar characteristic UV absorption to these of nocamycin I and nocamycin II are detected (Fig. 2II).

Complete spectral data including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra were also acquired (Additional file 1: Figures S10–S16), thereby allowing full assignments of the 1H and 13C signals (Table 4). Comparisons of the 1H and 13C NMR data for nocamycin I and nocamycin III revealed that the tetrahydrofuran ring is not closed and a Δ11,12 double bond is apparent in nocamycin III. HMBC correlations from H-20 to C-11, C-12, and C-13, and the COSY correlations of H-10/H-11 further substantiated these assignments. Additionally, H-15 was shifted to δH 4.29 due to the ring opening, relative to the same position of the cyclic form.

Complete spectral data including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra were also acquired (Additional file 1: Figures S17–S21), thereby allowing full assignments of the 1H and 13C signals (Table 4). It shared a similar structure to that of nocamycin III, except that a methyl signal at δH 1.62 was disappeared and an oxygen-bearing methylene signal at δH 3.96 and 4.07 occurred. Key HMBC correlations from H-20 to C-12 and from H-11 to C-12 further confirmed the location of the –CH2OH group at C-12. Thus, the structure of nocamycin IV was elucidated as 20-hydroxy-nocamycin III (Fig. 5). Discussion Discussion In this study, the gene cluster responsible for nocamycin biosynthesis identified from S. syringae consists of 21 ORFs: 12 coding for structural proteins, seven involved in regulator and resistance and two with unknown function. Like the reported biosynthetic gene clusters of tirandamycin and streptolydigin, a hybrid PKS-NRPS mechanism is employed to assemble the chain PK-NPR backbone by co-linearity rule [10, 13, 14]. The core structure of nocamycin is bicyclic ketal unit and tetramic acid moiety. To date, tetramic acid structure has been identified in numerous natural products and four phylogenetically different family enzymes have been characterized to catalyze the tetramic acid formation through Dieckmann cyclisation reaction [21, 47–50]. In previous report, TrdC and its homologous protein SlgL have been characterized as Dieckmann cyclases to catalyze the formation of tetramic acid moiety in tirandamycin and streptolydigin biosynthetic pathway, respectively [21]. Thus, it is plausible to assume that NcmC, the homologous protein to TrdC, is employed to generate tetramic acid moiety through Dieckmann cyclisation during nocamycins biosynthetic pathway [21].

Formation of bicyclic ketal ring represents the most intriguing issue of nocamycin family natural products, which is not fully understood. In our previous study, an abnormal DH at module 3 in tirandamycin PKS was proposed to be involved in spiroketal structure formation [14]. Comparing with tirandamycin and streptolydigin gene clusters, it is important to notice that all the three gene clusters possess a similar unexpected DH domain with conserved active motif in the corresponding PKS. This abnormal DH domain at module 4 are likely not to catalyze the dehydration reaction to afford C-10 and C-11 double bond because the C-11 hydroxy group is absolutely required for the C-13 spiroketal group formation and no nocamycin derivatives possess C-10 and C-11 double bond have been identified. Recently, linear 7,13,9,13-diseco-tirandamycin derivative tirandamycin K, a shunt pathway product in tirandamycin pathway, was isolated from Streptomyces sp. 307-9 and its P450 monooxygenase disruption mutant strain [51]. C-9 hydroxyl in tirandamycin K clearly indicates that DH3-catalyzed dehydration can be avoided, and it also provides evidence to support the mechanism that DH3 is involved in bicyclic ketal formation [51]. Due to the high similarity in polyketide structure and domains organization of PKS between tirandamycin, nocamycin and streptolydigin gene clusters, the abnormal DH catalytic mechanisms are likely to be common spiroketalization mechanisms in these three pathways.

Based on bioinformatics and genetic engineering data, post tailoring steps of nocamycin can be predicted as follows (Fig. 4). Firstly, the earliest intermediate released from the PCP protein possesses a hydroxyl group in C-11 position, NcmE catalyze the dehydration process to afford nocamycin III. Next, nocamycin III undergoes several oxidative and one methyl esterification steps to produce nocamycin I. At last, NcmD catalyzes the dehydrogenation process to afford nocamycin II. Comparisons of gene clusters of tirandamycin and nocamycin revealed an interesting phenomenon that the post-tailoring enzymes involved in modification of similar structure are varied. In tirandamycin biosynthetic pathway, a FAD-dependent dehydrogenase TrdL/TamL is responsible for the conversion from C-10 hydroxyl to C-10 ketone [15, 16]. In our initial hypothesis, a TrdL/TamL homologous protein is predicted to be responsible for the same process, however, no TrdL/TamL homologous protein has been observed within the gene cluster. Although NcmL shows FAD-binding domain, it lacks the conserved bicovalent FAD linked active sites to that in TamL/TrdL [15, 16]. Meanwhile, the gene inactivation experiments revealed that NcmL shows no relationship to nocamycin biosynthesis, and this result also indicates that diversified modification mechanism occurred in this class of natural products. Overview the gene cluster, the short-chain dehydrogenase NcmD is the best candidate to catalyze the last C-10 dehydrogenation step in nocamycin biosynthetic pathway. The complex oxidative modifications including formation of fused oxolane ring system in bicyclic ketal moiety and the conversion from methyl group to carboxyl are intriguing issues, and the two cytochrome P450 oxidase NcmG and NcmO are expected to be involved in these steps. Two new derivatives nocamycin III and nocamycin IV lacking of closed tetrahydrofuran ring from ΔncmG mutant strain indicates NcmG’s involvement in the formation of the fused oxolane ring system. In terms of oxolane ring system formation, four different biosynthetic routes have been envisioned [52–55]. The mechanism of tetrahydrofuran ring in nocamycin is proposed to be similar to that in nonactin biosynthesis pathway [52]. NcmG is likely to catalyze conjugate addition of C-15 hydroxyl groups to the adjacent C-11 and C-12 alkenyl moiety to form oxolane ring (Fig. 4). We notice that the C-20 hydroxyl in nocamycin IV is similar to C-18 hydroxyl in tirandamycin B. In tirandamycin biosynthetic pathway, a multifunctional cytochrome P450 TamI has been verified to be responsible for the formation of C-18 hydroxyl group [15]. However, C-20 hydroxylation modification is not required in nocamycin biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 4). Thus, we hypothesize that nocamycin IV is probably a shunt product in nocamycins biosynthetic pathway and an oxidase located elsewhere of the genome can catalyze the hydroxylation process. Considerations of several oxidative modifications are required to afford nocamycin II, one of NcmG and NcmO is potentially responsible for more than one oxidative tailoring steps. Elucidation of the exact roles of NcmG and NcmO and the timing of modification in nocamycin biosynthesis is our ongoing project.

Conclusion Conclusion The nocamycin I and II, bearing a tricyclic ketal moiety, belong to acyl tetramic acid natural products and they display broad antimicrobial activity. In this report, we identify nocamycins biosynthetic gene cluster from rare actinomycete Saccharothrix syringae, which provides us the genetic insights into nocamycins biosynthesis and enzyme candidates for several intriguing biochemical transformations. Inactivation of cytochrome P450 monoxygenase NcmG led to isolation of two novel nocamycin derivatives from the mutant strain. Based on gene cluster data and new derivatives isolated from gene inactivation mutant strain, a putative biosynthetic pathway of nocamycin is proposed. These findings provide insights into further investigation of nocamycin biosynthetic mechanism, and also set the stage to rationally engineer new nocamycin derivatives via manipulating biosynthetic pathway.
