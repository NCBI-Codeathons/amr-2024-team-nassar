Text Text Bioactive natural products have evolved to inhibit specific cellular targets and have served as lead molecules for health and agricultural applications for the last century1–3. The post-genomics era has brought a renaissance in natural product discovery using synthetic biology tools4–6. However, compared to traditional bioactivity-guided approaches, genome mining of natural products with specific and potent biological activities remains challenging4. Here we present the discovery and validation of a highly potent herbicide lead that targets a critical metabolic enzyme that is required for plant survival. Our approach is based on the coclustering of a self-resistance gene in the natural product biosynthetic gene cluster7–9, which serves as a window to potential biological activity of the encoded compound. We targeted dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthetic pathway in plants, the last step in this pathway often targeted for herbicide development10. We showed the fungal sesquiterpenoid aspterric acid (AA) discovered using this method is a submicromolar inhibitor of DHAD and is effective as an herbicide in spray applications. The self-resistance gene astD was validated to be insensitive to AA and was deployed as a transgene in establishment of plants that are resistant to AA. This herbicide-resistance gene combination complements urgent efforts in overcoming weed resistance11. Our discovery demonstrates the potential of using a resistance-gene directed approach in mining of bioactive natural products.

Our discovery demonstrates the potential of using a resistance-gene directed approach in mining of bioactive natural products. Weeds are a major source of crop losses, and the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds has led to an urgent need for new herbicides with novel modes of action11–14. The BCAAs biosynthetic pathway is essential for plant growth10. It is not present in animals and is therefore a validated target for highly specific weed control agents10. The BCAA biosynthetic pathway in plants is carried out by three enzymes: acetolactate synthase (ALS), acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (KARI), and DHAD (Fig. 1a). Given the success of targeting ALS for herbicide development11, it is surprising that no herbicide that targets either of the other two enzymes has been developed. DHAD which catalyzes β-dehydration reactions to yield α-keto acid precursors to isoleucine, valine and leucine, is an essential and highly conserved enzyme among plant species15,16 (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Efforts toward synthetic DHAD inhibitors resulted in compounds with submicromolar Ki; however, the compounds have no in planta activity17 (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Filamentous fungi are prolific producers of natural products (NPs), many of which have biological activities that aid the fungi in colonizing and killing plants1,2,18. Therefore, fungal NPs represent a promising source of potential leads for herbicides. The abundance of sequenced fungal genomes enables genome mining of new NPs with novel biological activities4,6. Although no NP inhibitors of DHAD are known to date, we reason a fungal NP with this property might exist, given the indispensable role of BCAA biosynthesis in plants10.

Although no NP inhibitors of DHAD are known to date, we reason a fungal NP with this property might exist, given the indispensable role of BCAA biosynthesis in plants10. To identify NP biosynthetic gene clusters that may encode a DHAD inhibitor, we hypothesized that such cluster must contain an additional copy of DHAD that is insensitive to the inhibitor, thereby providing the required self-resistance for the producing organism to survive. The presence of a gene encoding a self-resistance enzyme is frequently found in microbial NP gene clusters, as highlighted by the presence of an insensitive copy of HMGR or IMPDH in the gene clusters for lovastatin (that targets HMGR) or mycophenolic acid (that targets IMPDH), respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1c)19,20. This phenomenon has been used to predict molecular targets of NPs, as well as to identify gene clusters of NPs of known activities5,7,9.

This phenomenon has been used to predict molecular targets of NPs, as well as to identify gene clusters of NPs of known activities5,7,9. To identify possible self-resistance enzymes, we scanned sequenced fungal genomes to search for colocalizations of genes encoding DHAD with core biosynthetic enzymes, such as terpene cyclases, polyketide synthases, etc21,22. We identified a well-conserved set of four genes across multiple fungal genomes (Fig. 1b), including the common soil fungus Aspergillus terreus that is best known to produce lovastatin. The conserved gene clusters include genes that encode a sesquiterpene cyclase homolog (astA), two cytochrome P450s (astB and astC), and a homolog of DHAD (astD). Genes outside of this cluster are not conserved across the identified genomes and are hence unlikely to be involved in NP biosynthesis. AstD is the second copy of DHAD encoded in the genome, and is ~70% similar to the housekeeping copy that is well-conserved across fungi (Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, AstD is potentially a self-resistance enzyme that confers resistance to the encoded NP. Like a majority of biosynthetic gene clusters in sequenced fungal genomes, the ast cluster has not been associated with the production of a known NP4.

Like a majority of biosynthetic gene clusters in sequenced fungal genomes, the ast cluster has not been associated with the production of a known NP4. To identify the NP encoded by the ast cluster, we heterologously expressed astA, astB, and astC genes in the host Saccharomyces cerevisiae RC0123. New compounds that emerged were purified and their structures were elucidated with NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 5). RC01 expressing only astA produced a new sesquiterpene (1), which was confirmed to be (−)-daucane (Supplementary Fig. 4). RC01 expressing both astA and astB led to the biosynthesis of a new product that was structurally determined to be the α-epoxy carboxylate (2) (Fig. 1c). When astA, astB and astC were expressed together, a new compound (3) became the dominant product (~ 20 mg/L). Full structural determination revealed the compound to be the tricyclic aspterric acid (AA), which is a previously isolated compound (Fig. 1c)24. The biosynthetic pathway for AA is therefore concise: following cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate by AstA to create the carbon skeleton in 1, AstB catalyzes oxidation of 1 to yield the epoxide 2. Further oxidation by AstC at carbon 15 yields an alcohol, which can undergo intramolecular epoxide opening to create AA (Fig. 1d).

Further oxidation by AstC at carbon 15 yields an alcohol, which can undergo intramolecular epoxide opening to create AA (Fig. 1d). Upon its initial discovery, AA was shown to have inhibitory activity towards Arabidopsis thaliana, however, the mode of action was not known25. Our resistance-gene directed approach led to rediscovery of this compound with DHAD as a potential target. We first confirmed that AA is able to potently inhibit A. thaliana growth in an agar-based assay (Fig. 2a, and Supplementary Fig. 5). AA was also an effective inhibitor of root development and plant growth when applied to a representative monocot (Zea mays) and dicot (Solanum lycopersicum) (Fig. 2b). To test if AA indeed targets DHAD, we expressed and purified housekeeping DHAD from both A. terreus (XP_001208445.1, fDHAD) and A. thaliana (AT3G23940, pDHAD), as well as the putative self-resistance enzyme AstD (Supplementary Fig. 6). Both housekeeping DHAD enzymes converted dihydroxyisovalerate to ketoisovalerate (pDHAD: kcat = 1.2 sec−1, KM = 5.7 mM) as expected. The enzyme activities, however, were inhibited in the presence of AA (Extended Data Fig. 2). The IC50 values of AA towards fDHAD and pDHAD were 0.31 μM and 0.50 μM at an enzyme concentration of 0.50 μM, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3). AA was further determined to be a competitive inhibitor of pDHAD with a Ki = 0.30 μM (Extended Data Fig. 3). AA displayed no significant cytotoxicity towards human cell lines up to 500 μM concentration, consistent with the lack of DHAD in mammalian cells (Supplementary Fig. 7).

AA displayed no significant cytotoxicity towards human cell lines up to 500 μM concentration, consistent with the lack of DHAD in mammalian cells (Supplementary Fig. 7). AstD catalyzes the identical β-dehydration reaction as DHAD, albeit with a significantly more sluggish turnover rate (kcat = 0.03 sec−1, KM = 5.4 mM). However, the enzyme was not inhibited by AA, even at the solubility limit of 8 mM (Extended Data Fig. 3). To determine if AstD can confer resistance to AA-sensitive strains, we developed a yeast based assay. The genome copy of DHAD encoded by ILV3 was first deleted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain DHY ΔURA3, which resulted in an auxotroph that requires exogenous addition of Ile, Leu and Val to grow. We then introduced either fDHAD or astD episomally, both of which allowed the strain to grow in the absence of the three BCAAs (Extended Data Fig. 4). However, yeast expressing fDHAD was approximately 100 times more sensitive to AA (IC50 of 2 μM) compared to yeast expressing AstD (IC50 of 200 μM) (Fig. 2c). Collectively, the biochemical and genetic assays validated AA as the first natural product inhibitor of fungal and plant DHAD; and AstD serves as the self-resistance enzyme in the ast biosynthetic gene cluster.

The (R)-α-hydroxyacid and (R)-configured β-ether oxygen moieties in AA mimic the (2R, 3R)-dihydroxy groups present in natural substrates such as dihydroxyisovalerate. The β-ether oxygen in AA is in position to coordinate to the 2Fe-2S cluster that is a required cofactor in both fungal and plant DHAD16,17. To understand potential AA mechanism of action, we determined the crystal structure (2.11 Å) of the pDHAD complexed with 2Fe-2S cluster (holo-pDHAD) (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 5, and Extended Data Table 1). We identified a binding chamber at the homodimer interface, similar to that found in the holo bacterial L-arabinonate dehydratase26 (Fig. 2d). The interior of the chamber is positively charged (2Fe-2S and Mg2+) while the entrance is lined with hydrophobic residues. The modeled binding mode of α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate and AA predicted by computational docking are shown in Fig. 2e. The pocket is sufficiently spacious to accommodate the bulkier AA, and provide stronger hydrophobic interactions than the native substrate with a 5.3 ± 0.3 kcal/mol gain in binding energy (Fig. 2e). Base on the holo-pDHAD structure, we constructed a homology model of AstD to determine potential mechanism of resistance (Extended Data Fig. 5 and 6). Comparison of pDHAD and the modeled AstD structures shows that while most of the residues in the catalytic chamber are conserved, the hydrophobic region at the entrance to the reactive chamber in AstD is more constricted as a result of two amino acid substitutions (V496L and I177L). Narrowing of the entrance could therefore sterically exclude the bulkier AA from binding in the active site, while the smaller, natural substrates are still able to enter the chamber.

To explore the potential of AA as an herbicide, we performed spray treatment of A. thaliana with AA. We added AA into a commercial glufosinate formulation known as Finale® at a final AA concentration of 250 μM27,28. We then sprayed AA solution onto glufosinate resistant A. thaliana. Finale® alone had no observable inhibitory effects on plant growth, but adding AA severely inhibited plant growth (Extended Data Fig. 7). In addition, A. thaliana plants treated with AA before flowering failed to form normal pollen, which was also observed previously25. We found that the pistil of treated plants could still be successfully pollinated using healthy pollen from the untreated A. thaliana, indicating that AA preferentially affects pollen but not egg formation (Extended Data Fig. 8 and 9). This effect was also observed with a lower concentration of AA (100 μM). Thus, in addition to its herbicidal properties, AA could potentially be used as a chemical hybridization agent for hybrid seed production29.

We next investigated whether plants expressing astD are resistant to AA. This was motivated by the successful combination of glyphosate and genetically modified crops that are selectively resistant to glyphosate (Roundup Ready®)30. The A. terreus astD gene was codon optimized and the N-terminus was fused to a chloroplast localization signal derived from pDHAD. Wild type or astD transgene-expressing A. thaliana was then grown on media that contained 100 μM AA. In the presence of AA, the growth of wild-type plants was strongly inhibited, and arrested at the cotyledon stage (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the growth of astD transgenic plants was relatively unaffected by AA, as indicated by the normally expanded rosette leaves, elongated roots, and whole plant fresh weight (Fig. 3a and b). The expression of AstD was verified by western blot (Supplementary Fig. 8). A spray assay was also performed using T2 astD transgenic A. thaliana plants, which showed no observable growth defects under such treatment (Fig. 3c). In contrast, the control plants carrying the empty vector showed a strong growth inhibitory phenotype when treated with AA (Fig. 3c). Quantitative measurements of plant height showed AstD effectively confers AA resistance to A. thaliana (Fig. 3d). We next investigated whether plants expressing astD are resistant to AA.

In summary, resistance-gene directed discovery of NPs in the fungus A. terreus led to the discovery of a natural herbicide AA and the determination of its mode of action. In addition, introducing astD as a transgene or editing the sequence of the plant DHAD endogenous gene could be used to create AA-resistant crops. We suggest that AA is a promising lead for the development as a broad spectrum commercial herbicide.

The LigPrep module in Schrodinger software was introduced for geometric optimization by using OPLS3 force field40. The ionization state of ligands were calculated with Epik tool employing Hammett and Taft methods in conjunction with ionization and tautomerization tools43. The docking of a ligand to the receptor was performed using Glide44. We included cofactors observed in crystal structure during the docking. Since both water and SO42− occupied the catalytic site, they were excluded prior to docking. Cubic boxes centered on the ligand mass center with a radius 8 Å for all ligands defined the docking binding regions. Flexible ligand docking was executed for all structures. Ten poses per ligand out of 20,000 were included in the post-docking energy minimization. The best scored pose for the ligand was chosen as the initial structure for further study. The MM/GBSA method was introduced to evaluate the ligand binding affinity based on the best scored docking pose in Schrodinger software. Figures are prepared in PyMOL and Inkscape45,46. Both of native substrate α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate and AA were docked into the catalytic site of pDHAD. The cross-section electrostatic surface map shows this unique catalytic pocket has a positively charged internal and a hydrophobic entrance, which binds to negatively charged “head” and hydrophobic “tail” of substrate or AA respectively. Thus the negatively charged “head” can lead both of the substrate and AA into the catalytic chamber. The bulky hydrophobic tricyclic moiety of AA, however, provides stronger hydrophobic interactions to the entrance and blocks the entrance of active site due to the hydrophobic residues at the entrance, including G68, A71, I72, I134, A133, M141, V212, F215, M498 and P501. In contrast, the smaller “tail” of native substrate provides less interactions to entrance because the smaller size limits efficient hydrophobic contact to nearby residues. This implies that once AA binds to pDHAD, it can prevent substrate approaching the active site. We also introduced molecular mechanics generalized Born and surface area (MM/GBSA) continuum solvation method, an widely used approach for relative binding energy calculation, to evaluate the relative binding affinity for both ligands47. The MM/GBSA calculations had been done in Prime48 (Schrödinger 2015 suite). The MM/GBSA energy was calculated using following equation:

To improve the wetting and penetration, AA was firstly dissolved in ethanol and then added to solvent (0.06 g/L Finale® Bayer Inc. + 20 g/L ethanol) to make 250 μM AA spraying solution. The control plants were treated with solvent containing ethanol only. Spraying treatments began upon the seeds germination, and were repeated once every two days with approximately 0.4 mL AA solution per time per pot for 4 weeks. The picture shown below is taken after one month of treatment. The application rate of AA is approximately 1.6 lb/acre, which is comparable to the commonly used herbicide glyphosate (0.75~1.5 lb/acre).

AA-resistance of Arabidopsis plants expressing astD transgenes. a, Phenotype of 10-day old A. thaliana with (lower) and without (upper) astD transgene growing on media containing 100 μM AA. Control plants were transformed with a vector that carries the glufosinate ammonium selection marker but no astD transgene. The picture shown is representative of 3 replicates. b, Fresh weight of 3-week old Arabidopsis seedlings growing on media with (red box) and without (blue box) 100 μM AA; Box plots show the median and extend of the 1st to 3rd quartile range, with individual data points overlaid; n = 21 biologically independent experiments. c, glufosinate-resistant Arabidopsis with (lower) and without (upper) astD transgene growing in soil were sprayed with glufosinate ammonium with (left) and without (right) 250 μM AA. i. control sprayed with 250 μM AA + glufosinate ammonium. ii. control sprayed with glufosinate ammonium only. iii. astD transgenic Arabidopsis sprayed with 250 μM AA + glufosinate ammonium. iv. astD transgenic Arabidopsis sprayed with glufosinate ammonium only. The picture shown is representative of 3 replicates. d, Quantification of the height of Arabidopsis treated the same as in c; The plot shows mean values ± s.d. (error bars); n = 12 biologically independent experiments.
