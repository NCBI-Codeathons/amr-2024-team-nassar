Due to the significant antibacterial properties of edeines, increasing edeine yield is of great interest in biomedical research. Herein, we identified that EdeB, a member of the ParB protein family, significantly improved edeine production in B. brevis. First, overexpression of edeB in B. brevis X23 increased edeine production by 92.27%. Second, in vitro bacteriostasis experiment showed that edeB-deletion mutant exhibited less antibacterial activity. Third, RT-qPCR assay demonstrated that the expression of edeA, edeQ, and edeK, which are key components of the edeine biosynthesis pathway, in edeB-deletion mutant X23(ΔedeB) was significantly lower than that in wild-type B. brevis strain X23. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that EdeB directly bound to the promoter region of the edeine biosynthetic gene cluster (ede BGC), suggesting that EdeB improves edeine production through interaction with ede BGC in B. brevis. Introduction Introduction B. brevis is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and spore-producing bacterium, which produces several antibacterial substances, but not toxins (Cook, 1993; Che et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2015; Jianmei et al., 2015). Its antibacterial products are widely used in biological control of plant diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria (Yang and Yousef, 2018; Saxena et al., 2020). Edeines, which are non-ribosomal antibacterial peptides produced by B. brevis, consist of four unconventional amino acid residues, a glycine, and a polyamine (
Figure 1A
) (Hettinger and Craig, 1970; Czerwinski et al., 1983; Johnson et al., 2020). As non-ribosomal antibacterial peptides, edeines are synthesized by the multifunctional enzyme complex system of “sulfur template polymerase mechanism”. The unique molecular structure of edeines contributes to a variety of biological function, including antimicrobial and antitumor activities, which can greatly inhibit the growth of numerous bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and tumor cells (Kurylo-Borowska and Szer, 1973; Cozzarelli, 1977; Czajgucki et al., 2010). Edeines inhibit bacterial growth through a number of different targets, including DNA, RNA, and ribosomes (protein synthesis), at a dose-dependent manner (Chen and Lu, 2020). At low concentration (<15 μg/mL), edeines reversibly constrain the activity of DNA polymerase II and III to inhibit DNA synthesis, however, the synthesis of protein is not affected. Edeines at high concentration (>150 μg/mL) bind to the P site of small ribosomal subunit (30S subunit), which competitively blocks the binding of fMet-tRNA onto ribosomes and simultaneously inhibits the initiation of transcription and protein translation (Szer and Kurylo-Borowska, 1972; Dinos et al., 2004). In addition, edeines can be used as a transcriptional inhibitor to study ribosome function and protein synthesis. Moreover, edeines can also eliminate bacterial resistance caused by plasmid genes and inhibit the division of Bacillus subtilis cells (Shimotohno et al., 2010; Semenchenko et al., 2016). B. brevis is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and spore-producing bacterium, which produces several antibacterial substances, but not toxins (Cook, 1993; Che et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2015; Jianmei et al., 2015).

Regardless of the biological activities of edeines mentioned above, low production level of edeines by edeine-producing bacteria is a major issue limiting their applications in medicine and agriculture. Edeine A and B produced by B. brevis X23 exhibit wide antibacterial spectrum and have been used as biocontrol agents against bacterial wilt in solanaceae crops. The complete genomic sequence of B. brevis X23 allows the identification of edeine biosynthetic gene cluster (ede BGC) (Wu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016). In this study, we identified and explored the biological function of regulatory proteins involved in biosynthesis of edeines, which will provide a theoretical basis for the construction of B. brevis strains with high-yield of edeines through genetic manipulation.

A potential transcriptional factor gene edeB on the ede BGC was identified on the basis of bioinformatic analysis of B. brevis X23 genome. Protein EdeB contains a typical helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain, which is conserved in ParB family transcriptional factors. Although ParB homolog proteins have been annotated from many genomes of Bacillus species, their function has not been fully understood yet. In this study, we constructed a B. brevis mutant X23(ΔedeB) by disrupting the edeB gene through Red/ET homologous recombination. Furthermore, a complementary strain and edeB-overexpression strain were constructed using the expression plasmid PAD-Apr-Px-edeB vector. Subsequently, we compared edeine production among those different B. brevis strains to explore the effect of edeB on the yield of edeines. The binding ability between EdeB protein and the promoter region of ede BGC was also evaluated. Our results demonstrated that EdeB significantly improved edeine production in B. brevis X23 through binding to ede BGC.

EdeB directly regulates the promoter region of ede BGC EdeB directly regulates the promoter region of ede BGC EdeB directly regulates the promoter region of ede BGC Transcriptional regulators usually control transcription by specifically binding to the promoter region of target genes (Leslie and Justin, 2013). In order to study whether EdeB regulates edeine biosynthesis through the same way, EMSA was used to evaluate the binding ability of EdeB with the promoter region of ede BGC. The results showed that EdeB inhibited the migration of promoter fragment edePro, suggesting that EdeB directly interact with ede BGC. The interaction between EdeB and ede BGC was further confirmed (

Discussion Discussion Edeines are natural nonribosomal peptides with antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor activities (Johnson et al., 2020). Edeines are produced by B. brevis under appropriate condition, however, only a few reports focusing on the molecular pathway and regulatory factors involved in edeine production in B. brevis. Westman first identified the edeine biosynthetic gene cluster in B. brevis Vm4, and confirmed that edeQ was a resistance gene. Heterologous expression of edeQ enhanced resistance of edeines in Bacillus subtilis (Westman et al., 2013). In addition, Zhang et al. reported that AbrB downregulated the biosynthesis of edeines in B. brevis X23, and abrB knockout improved the yield of edeines (Zhang et al., 2020).

Currently, our understanding of the molecular pathway and regulation of edeine biosynthesis is still limited. In this study, we identified that the regulatory gene edeB on ede BGC was involved in edeine biosynthesis of B. brevis X23. Bioinformatics analysis showed that EdeB protein is a member of the ParB family, which are plasmid active distribution proteins involved in the distribution of plasmids and chromosomes, as well as embodying DNA-binding activity (Jalal et al., 2020). Recent studies have shown that many ParB family proteins functioned as transcription factors in numerous biological processes (Khare et al., 2004). In addition, EdeB protein contains a typical HTH domain, which can bind with DNA, suggesting that EdeB protein plays a regulatory role in transcription (Kusiak1 et al., 2011). While ParB family proteins are common in Bacillus, their role in the regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis has not been clearly studied (Webb et al., 2010). SbnI, a protein of the ParB superfamily, is a heme-inducible transcriptional regulator involved in Staphyloferrin B (SB) production (Laakso et al., 2016). SbnI also exhibited enzymatic function in SB biosynthesis (Skaar et al., 2004). It has been shown that Glu20 and Asp58 were required for the kinase activity of SbnI (Verstraete et al., 2018). The N-terminal of EdeB protein contains a SnbI_like domain, suggesting that it may has similar function as SnbI.

The important role of gene edeB in the edeine biosynthesis was confirmed by edeB knockout and complementation experiments. The inhibition zone of B. brevis strain with edeB knockout significantly smaller, and the antibacterial activity was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type B. brevis strain X23. Gene edeB complementation restored and improved its antibacterial ability. HPLC-MS results showed that edeB knockout reduced edeine production by 18%, but edeB complementation increased edeine production by 20.43%. Taken together, these results suggest that edeB was essential for edeine biosynthesis by upregulating edeine production.

Taken together, these results suggest that edeB was essential for edeine biosynthesis by upregulating edeine production. The expression of edeA, edeQ, and edeK on ede BGC was analyzed by RT-qPCR. The results showed that the expression of these three genes were significantly reduced in edeB-deletion mutant. The genes with decreased transcription were involved in antibiotic transport, core skeleton formation, and resistance in edeine biosynthesis. Reduced transcription of these genes may be regulated by EdeB, which is consistent with decreased production of edeines in edeB-deletion mutant, suggesting that edeB is a positive regulator in the biosynthesis of edeines.

EMSA analysis showed that EdeB could directly bound to the promoter region of ede BGC. Based on the direct interaction between EdeB and edePro, and edeB deletion and complementation experiments discussed above, we propose a molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory role of EdeB in edeine biosynthesis. EdeB upregulates the expression of the genes on ede BGC to improve the production of edeines through binding to the promoter region of ede BGC. However, whether other proteins are involved in this process or interact with EdeB is still not known. In summary, EdeB is a major component in edeine biosynthesis. Overexpressing edeB can significantly improve edeine production in B. brevis, which may have wide applications in medicine and agriculture.

Conclusion Conclusion In this study, we identified and characterized a ParB family transcription factor, EdeB, which significantly increased the expression of several genes on ede BGC, and significantly improved the production of edeine A and B. In addition, our results demonstrated that EdeB directly bound to the promoter region of ede BGC to improve the transcription and translation of edeine genes.
