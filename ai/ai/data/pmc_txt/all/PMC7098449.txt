Fosmidomycin and related molecules comprise a family of phosphonate natural products with potent antibacterial, antimalarial and herbicidal activities. To understand the biosynthesis of these compounds, we characterized the fosmidomycin producer, Streptomyces lavendulae, using biochemical and genetic approaches. Surprisingly, we were unable to elicit production of fosmidomycin, instead observing the unsaturated derivative dehydrofosmidomycin, which we showed potently inhibits 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase and has bioactivity against a number of bacteria. The genes required for dehydrofosmidomycin biosynthesis were established by heterologous expression experiments. Bioinformatics analyses, characterization of intermediates, and in vitro biochemistry show that the biosynthetic pathway involves conversion of a two-carbon phosphonate precursor into the unsaturated three-carbon product via a highly unusual rearrangement reaction, catalyzed by the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase DfmD. The required genes and biosynthetic pathway for dehydrofosmidomycin differ substantially from that of the related natural product FR-900098, suggesting that the ability to produce these bioactive molecules arose via convergent evolution. Graphical Abstract  Resistance to bioactive small molecules lies at the heart of many pressing societal concerns. Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections have risen to crisis levels, with approximately 2 million cases and 23,000 deaths a year in the United States alone (1). Similarly, resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to widely used combination therapies has been observed in at least 5 countries in southeast Asia, raising the frightening prospect of untreatable malaria (currently 200 million cases and 400,000 deaths a year) (2); whereas resistance to commonly used herbicides and pesticides threatens the food supply, costing US farmers an estimated $1 billion per year in lost crops (3). To deal with these threats, society must implement more effective policies and strategies governing the use of these essential molecules so as to minimize the acquisition of resistance. It is equally clear that improved discovery pipelines will be required to deliver novel bioactive agents that are effective against resistant organisms that already exist, as well as those that will inevitably arise in the future. Historically, natural products have been among the best sources for these bioactive molecules. Although private sector research in this area has diminished, recent advances in genomics, chemistry and bioinformatics suggest that natural products will remain a critical source of bioactive compounds in the future (4–6). A particularly promising family of natural products, with great potential in both agriculture and human health, was discovered by researchers at Fujisawa Pharmaceutical in 1979 (Fig. 1a) (7–10). These molecules share a common hydroxyaminopropylphosphonic acid scaffold and include fosmidomycin (1, originally designated FR-31564) and an unsaturated derivative designated FR-32863 (2, hereafter dehydrofosmidomycin) produced by Streptomyces lavendulae (7–9), as well as FR-900098 and its hydroxylated congener FR-33289 produced by Streptomyces rubellomurinus (7–10). Three of the four molecules (FR-33289 is the exception) have potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae (8, 11). Both FR-900098 and fosmidomycin also display substantial antimalarial activity (12), with promising results in early clinical trials (13). The bioactivity of FR-900098 and fosmidomycin is based on their inhibition of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) (14), the rate-limiting step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway for biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors. The MEP pathway is an attractive target for development of antibiotic and antimalarial medicines due to the absence of the pathway in humans and other mammals, which instead utilize the mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis (15). Importantly, isoprenoid biosynthesis in plant chloroplasts also occurs via the MEP pathway, and inhibition of DXR is lethal to plants (16, 17). Thus, the fosmidomycin family of natural products also possess herbicidal activity (18). In this regard, S. rubellomurinus encodes an FR-900098-resistant allele of DXR within the biosynthetic gene cluster, which could be used to genetically engineer crops with specific resistance to these herbicides (19). Although the biosynthetic machinery needed for production of fosmidomycin has yet to be established, the genes and metabolic pathway required for synthesis of FR-900098 have been characterized in great detail (19, 20) (Fig. 1b & Supplementary Fig. 1A). The FR-900098 biosynthetic gene cluster is comprised of eleven genes designated frbABCDEFGHI-dxrB. The function of each gene, as well as the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the encoded proteins, has been definitively established in a series of genetic and biochemical studies (19, 20). Moreover, knowledge of this pathway has enabled the construction of engineered strains that produce FR-900098 at substantially higher levels than the native producer S. rubellomurinus (20). Biosynthesis of FR-900098 begins with conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (3) to phosphonopyruvate (4) by the enzyme PEP mutase, a step common to nearly all phosphonate biosynthetic pathways (6). Because synthesis of phosphonopyruvate is highly unfavorable, net synthesis of phosphonic acids via PEP mutase requires a thermodynamically favorable driving reaction following the PEP mutase reaction. In the case of FR-900098, this driving reaction involves condensation of phosphonopyruvate with acetyl-CoA, a reaction similar to that catalyzed by citrate synthase. Subsequent steps in the pathway are also similar to those of the TCA cycle, with the four-carbon phosphonic acid analogue of 2-oxoglutarate ultimately being converted to the three-carbon final product via decarboxylation of a nucleotide-activated intermediate (20, 21). Notably, the FR-900098 pathway differs from most other known phosphonate biosynthetic pathways, which decarboxylate phosphonopyruvate to phosphonoacetaldehyde (5) to provide the thermodynamic driving force needed for phosphonate synthesis (e.g. biosynthesis of the common phosphonate natural product 2-aminoethylphopshonate (2AEP; 6), Supplementary Fig. 1B) (22–24). Thus, canonical phosphonate biosynthetic pathways proceed via an early two-carbon intermediate rather than the four-carbon intermediate found in the FR-900098 pathway. The frb gene cluster also encodes an FR-900098-resistant allele of Dxr (dxrB), which is responsible for self-resistance in S. rubellomurinus and a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygense (encoded by frbJ) that converts FR-900098 to FR-33289 (20). Given the similarity of their chemical structures, biological targets and producing microorganisms, one might expect that the biosynthetic pathways of fosmidomycin and FR-900098 would be nearly identical. Thus, it was surprising to find that the S. lavendulae genome lacks homologs of most of the frb genes. Instead, the organism encodes a putative biosynthetic gene cluster that shares only four of thirteen genes with the frb cluster, but which is otherwise more similar to canonical phosphonate biosynthetic clusters. Here, we show that this divergent gene cluster is indeed responsible for phosphonate biosynthesis in S. lavendulae, producing an unsaturated member of the fosmidomycin family via an unusual biochemical pathway that is quite different from the FR-900098 pathway found in S. rubellomurinus. RESULTS RESULTS Streptomyces lavendulae produces dehydrofosmidomycin. Streptomyces lavendulae produces dehydrofosmidomycin. Streptomyces lavendulae produces dehydrofosmidomycin. To facilitate our studies, we attempted to optimize production of fosmidomycin by S. lavendulae by growing the organism for varying amounts of time in five different media, including the original fosmidomycin production medium (8). Spent media from these cultures was tested for inhibition of DXR activity using an in vitro enzymatic assay and for inhibition of growth using a phosphonate-specific bioassay strain of E. coli (19). Positive results were obtained in both assays for numerous samples (Supplementary Table 1). Subsequent analysis of these samples by 31P NMR revealed the presence of numerous peaks in the range that is typical for phosphonic acids (5 to 30 ppm, (6, 25)), with a notable peak at ~11 ppm found in all active samples (Supplementary Table 1, Fig. 2). This peak differs substantially from that of fosmidomycin (~25 ppm), suggesting that this compound was not produced at levels detectable by 31P NMR under any of the growth conditions examined, a conclusion supported by the appearance of a new peak at 25 ppm upon spiking of these samples with authentic fosmidomycin standards (Fig. 2). Because fosmidomycin is a potent inhibitor of E. coli DXR (IC50
ca. 100 nM) (14), we considered the possibility that it was produced at levels high enough to inhibit DXR, but too low to be detected by NMR. To address this, we established the IC50 of the inhibitory compound via dilution of extracts analyzed by 31P NMR (Supplementary Fig. 2A,B). Based on these experiments, we conclude that had the activity been caused by fosmidomycin, it would have been present at ~3 mM, a concentration easily observable by 31P NMR (Supplementary Fig. 2C,D). Lastly, we were unable to detect fosmidomycin in any sample using sensitive high-resolution mass spectrometric (HRMS) detection, which easily detects fosmidomycin at 25 μM (Supplementary Fig. 2E). Thus, S. lavendulae does not appear to produce detectable levels of fosmidomycin under the conditions examined here. The reason for this discrepancy from previously published work is unclear at this time.

Thus, S. lavendulae does not appear to produce detectable levels of fosmidomycin under the conditions examined here. The reason for this discrepancy from previously published work is unclear at this time. S. lavendulae has also been reported to produce dehydrofosmidomycin, an unsaturated phosphonate with antibiotic activity similar to fosmidomycin (8). To determine whether the 31P NMR peak at 11 ppm is dehydrofosmidomycin, we chemically synthesized the compound using a streamlined route based on a previously published synthesis (26) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Addition of this standard to active extracts caused an increase in the 11 ppm signal, suggesting that this NMR peak represents dehydrofosmidomycin (Fig. 2). This conclusion is supported by HRMS detection of a molecule with the exact mass of dehydrofosmidomycin in the original samples (Supplementary Fig. 2F). We were also able to purify dehydrofosmidomycin from S. lavendulae extracts and confirm its structure via 1H NMR (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, we conclude that the major bioactive phosphonate produced by S. lavendulae under each of the conditions examined here is dehydrofosmidomycin rather than fosmidomycin.

Bioactivity of dehydrofosmidomycin. Bioactivity of dehydrofosmidomycin. Bioactivity of dehydrofosmidomycin. Few studies have examined the bioactivity of dehydrofosmidomycin (8, 27), possibly due to the challenge of isolating or synthesizing adequate amounts of the compound. Using our streamlined synthesis, we were able to access sufficient quantities of pure dehydrofosmidomycin to allow in vitro inhibition studies of bacterial DXR, revealing it to be a potent inhibitor of E. coli DXR, with IC50 values slightly lower than fosmidomycin (Supplementary Fig. 5). Synthetic dehydrofosmidomycin also showed antibiotic activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli, while having no activity against Gram-positive bacteria that lack the MEP pathway, such as S. aureus and E. faecalis (Supplementary Table 2).

The genome of S. lavendulae was recently sequenced as part of a large scale genome-mining project for discovery of phosphonate natural products (6). Because virtually all known phosphonate biosynthetic pathways begin with the enzyme PEP mutase (encoded by the pepM gene), and because genes encoding natural product biosynthetic pathways are typically clustered, it is usually possible to identify phosphonate biosynthetic gene clusters by searching genome sequences for pepM (5). Only one pepM-containing gene cluster was identified in the S. lavendulae genome sequence (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 3). This 15-kb locus contains 13 genes, which we designated dfmA through dfmM.

This 15-kb locus contains 13 genes, which we designated dfmA through dfmM. Surprisingly, the S. lavendulae dfm locus is very different from the S. rubellomurinus frb locus, which directs synthesis of the nearly identical natural product FR-900098. Comparison of the two biosynthetic gene clusters reveals only four homologous gene products: PEP mutase (frbD/dfmK), a putative self-resistance gene encoding a phosphonate-resistant DXR (dxrB/dfmE), a flavin-dependent amine monooxygenase (frbG/dfmG) and a nucleotide transferase/decarboxylase (frbH/dfmH). Notably, these genes have relatively low similarities (<45% identity, Supplementary Table 3), suggesting that they diverged from a common ancestor long ago. Homologs of the FR-900098 biosynthetic genes frbA, frbB, frbC, frbE, frbF, frbI and frbJ are not found within the dfm cluster. The dfm gene cluster also encodes a putative phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase (dfmL) and 2-aminoethylphosphonate aminotransferase (dfmM). Based on the well-characterized biosynthetic pathway (Supplementary Fig. 1B), the enzymes encoded by dfmKLM are likely to produce 2-AEP, suggesting that this compound is an intermediate in dehydrofosmidomycin biosynthesis. If so, the biosynthesis of dehydrofosmidomycin via an early two-carbon intermediate differs substantially from the four-carbon intermediate that is produced in the third step of FR-900098 biosynthesis (Fig. 1B). In addition to these genes, the dfm gene cluster encodes two putative S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)-dependent N-methyltransferases (dfmB and dfmC) with substantial homology to ones that convert phosphoethanolamine to phosphocholine (i.e. N-trimethyl-phosphoethanolamine), a putative 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase (dfmD) similar to γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenase, and two nucleoside-diphosphate kinases (dfmI and dfmJ). Finally, the gene cluster encodes a second, truncated homolog of PEP mutase (dfmA); however, the protein encoded by this gene lacks key PepM catalytic residues and is therefore likely to be a degenerate pseudogene.

To establish whether the dfm gene cluster is responsible for dehydrofosmidomycin biosynthesis, we performed a series of heterologous expression studies using S. albus J1074. A recombinant strain (S. albus J1074/dfm) carrying the full dfm gene cluster and several flanking genes on a chromosomal integration vector produced a compound with a 31P-NMR peak not seen in the untransformed S. albus host (Fig. 3A,B). This molecule was confirmed to be dehydrofosmidomycin by spiking with a synthetic standard (Fig. 3B), as well as by phosphonate-specific bioactivity assays, DXR inhibition assays, and HRMS experiments (Supplementary Fig. 6). Based on NMR and/or HRMS, the heterologous expression strain produced several additional phosphonates that could be biosynthetic intermediates; these include 2AEP, trimethyl-2AEP (11) and deoxydehydrofosmidomycin (12, Fig. 3B–D and Supplementary Fig. 7). To establish whether the dfm gene cluster is responsible for dehydrofosmidomycin biosynthesis, we performed a series of heterologous expression studies using S. albus J1074.

To determine the boundaries of the cluster, we used a series of plasmids with progressively larger deletions for heterologous production experiments (Fig. 3A,C and Supplementary Fig. 8). Deletion of genes upstream of dfmA (Δ−1) has no effect on dehydrofosmidomycin production, thus defining the 5’-end of the cluster. A larger deletion that removes the PepM pseudogene dfmA (ΔA) does not abrogate phosphonate production, although strains carrying this plasmid produced lower levels of phosphonates, suggesting that the deletion alters expression levels of required downstream genes, perhaps by altering the native dfm promoter. Upon removal of dfmB (ΔAB), which encodes the first of the two N-methyltransferases, neither trimethyl-2AEP nor dehydrofosmidomycin are produced. Instead, a buildup of 2AEP is observed, suggesting that dfmB (and/or a downstream gene whose expression is reduced by removal of a shared promoter) is necessary to convert 2-AEP to trimethyl-2AEP, which is then further modified to generate dehydrofosmidomycin. In this regard, the biosynthesis of similar trimethylated amines (e.g. phosphocholine and betaine) often involves two SAM-dependent methyltransferases with one enzyme catalyzing the first (and sometimes second) methylation event and the second enzyme catalyzing the formation of the trimethylated product (28–30). Therefore, it is likely that the second SAM-dependent methyltransferase gene (dfmC) is also involved in the synthesis of trimethyl-2AEP. As discussed above, the dfmKLM genes are probably responsible for synthesis of 2AEP. The fact that 2AEP is produced by recombinant strains carrying the ΔAB plasmid suggests that the dfmKLM genes have their own promoter. To determine the boundaries of the cluster, we used a series of plasmids with progressively larger deletions for heterologous production experiments (Fig. 3A,C and Supplementary Fig. 8). Deletion of genes upstream of dfmA (Δ−1) has no effect on dehydrofosmidomycin production, thus defining the 5’-end of the cluster.

In this regard, the biosynthesis of similar trimethylated amines (e.g. phosphocholine and betaine) often involves two SAM-dependent methyltransferases with one enzyme catalyzing the first (and sometimes second) methylation event and the second enzyme catalyzing the formation of the trimethylated product (28–30). Therefore, it is likely that the second SAM-dependent methyltransferase gene (dfmC) is also involved in the synthesis of trimethyl-2AEP. As discussed above, the dfmKLM genes are probably responsible for synthesis of 2AEP. The fact that 2AEP is produced by recombinant strains carrying the ΔAB plasmid suggests that the dfmKLM genes have their own promoter. To determine the boundaries of the cluster, we used a series of plasmids with progressively larger deletions for heterologous production experiments (Fig. 3A,C and Supplementary Fig. 8). Deletion of genes upstream of dfmA (Δ−1) has no effect on dehydrofosmidomycin production, thus defining the 5’-end of the cluster. A larger deletion that removes the PepM pseudogene dfmA (ΔA) does not abrogate phosphonate production, although strains carrying this plasmid produced lower levels of phosphonates, suggesting that the deletion alters expression levels of required downstream genes, perhaps by altering the native dfm promoter.

Deletions of genes downstream of dfmM (Δ+1) did not affect heterologous production of dehydrofosmidomycin in S. albus, defining the 3’-end of the cluster. When the 3’-deletion (ΔLM) included both dfmL, which encodes phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase, and dfmM, which encodes 2-AEP aminotransferase, no phosphonates were observed. This strongly suggests that phosphonoacetaldehyde (5; Supplementary Fig. 1B) is an early intermediate in the dehydrofosmidomycin biosynthetic pathway. Interestingly, the aminotransferase dfmM can be deleted (ΔM) without affecting production of any phosphonate. This is likely because other aminotransferases in S. albus J1074 are capable of converting phosphonoacetaldehyde into 2AEP. Similar results have been observed in the biosynthesis of phosphinothricin by Streptomyces hygroscopicus, which also accumulates 2AEP despite the absence of an AEP aminotransferase in the biosynthetic gene cluster (31). The genome of S. albus J1074 encodes two aminotransferases with moderate identity to DfmM (WP_003947938 at 38% and WP_003951764 at 31%) that could be responsible for this activity.

The heterologous expression data suggested that 2AEP is an intermediate in the dehydrofosmidomycin biosynthetic pathway. To provide further evidence, we grew S. albus J1074/ΔLM, with and without addition of 2AEP to the medium. Several phosphonates, including trimethyl-2AEP and dehydrofosmidomycin, were observed only when 2AEP was added to the medium. Because the deletion mutant is unable to produce any phosphonates, this provides strong evidence that 2AEP is taken up and converted to dehydrofosmidomycin in this strain (Figure 4A,B and Supplementary Fig. 9A,B).

Similarly, deletion of the SAM-dependent methyltransferase genes abrogates trimethyl-2AEP production with concomitant accumulation of 2AEP, suggesting that the latter is a precursor for the former. To test this, we grew the native producer S. lavendulae in media with 13CH3-labeled methionine. Because methionine is the direct precursor of methyl moiety in SAM, this results in 13C-methyl-labeling of molecules produced by SAM-dependent methyltransferases (e.g. DfmB and DfmC). Comparison of spent media with labeled and unlabeled methionine revealed the incorporation of three 13C into trimethyl-2AEP (Supplementary Figure 9C). Dehydrofosmidomycin containing two labeled carbons is also produced in this experiment, suggesting that two of the three methyl groups on trimethyl-2AEP are retained in the final compound (Figure 4C). To localize the position of these labeled carbons, we analyzed the ions produced by fragmentation of dehydrofosmidomycin using HRMS/MS (Supplementary Figure 9D,E). These data are consistent with one label being incorporated into the N-formyl carbon and the other between the nitrogen and the double bond within the propenyl carbon backbone of the molecule (Supplementary Figure 9D,E). Because it seems likely that multiple steps are required to convert trimethyl-2AEP to dehydrofosmidomycin, we also compared the metabolites in the extracts of S. lavendulae grown in media with labeled and unlabeled methionine, which revealed doubly labeled 13C-methyldehydrofosmidomycin (13) in extracts of the native producer S. lavendulae.

The SAM-dependent 13C-labeling pattern of dehydrofosmidomycin suggests that unusual biochemistry occurs after synthesis of trimethyl-2AEP. While the incorporation of 13C into the formyl group of dehydrofosmidomycin can be easily explained by direct oxidation of one of the N-methyl moieties during biosynthesis, the incorporation of a methyl-derived 13C into the propenyl carbon skeleton is unexpected. This finding suggests that a highly unusual rearrangement reaction, in which an N-methyl moiety is inserted into the carbon skeleton of final product. Given that this labeling pattern is retained in methyldehydrofosmidomycin, we propose that the substrate for this rearrangement reaction is trimethyl-2AEP. The dehydration reaction required to produce methyldehydrofosmidomycin could occur during, or subsequent to, the rearrangement reaction. This reaction series also requires the loss of one of the N-methyl groups of trimethyl-2AEP, which we suggest would occur via oxidation to formaldehyde, based on well-established precedent for the metabolism of N-methyl compounds (32).

A candidate for all three of these reactions is DfmD, a putative α-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase. Members of this large enzyme family are known to catalyze desaturation of molecules such as carbapenem and glucoraphasatin (33, 34), demethylation of N-methyl moieties by their oxidation to formaldehyde (35), and methylene insertion reactions such as that catalyzed by deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (36). In order for DfmD to catalyze the three reactions that are proposed here, it would need to perform sequential oxidation reactions requiring two equivalents of molecular oxygen. Such a reaction would involve a four-electron oxidation of the phosphonate substrate and two, two-electron oxidations of the co-substrate α-ketoglutarate. Precedent for sequential oxidations by an α-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase can be found in the reaction catalyzed by clavaminate synthase, which oxidatively cyclizes and oxidatively dehydrogenates proclavaminic acid to give clavaminic acid (37, 38). The closest biochemically characterized homologs of DfmD are γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenases, which catalyze the oxidation of a trimethylamine substrate during synthesis of carnitine (39). γ-Butyrobetaine dioxygenases have been shown to catalyze an unusual rearrangement reaction resulting in a methylene insertion when incubated with the enzyme inhibitor trimethylhydrazine-propionate (THP). This non-physiological reaction results in the 1,2-rearrangement of the quaternary ammonium compound to give the carbon chain extension product,3-amino-4-(methylamino)butanoic acid (AMBA) (Fig. 5A).(40, 41) A candidate for all three of these reactions is DfmD, a putative α-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase.

The purified enzyme was then incubated with trimethyl-2AEP, α-ketoglutarate, and iron(II) prior to analysis by 31P and 1H NMR. Reactions containing DfmD produced a novel phosphorus-containing peak at ca. 8 ppm that was not observed in reactions lacking the enzyme (Fig. 5B). Addition of a chemically synthesized methyldehydrofosmidomycin standard (Supplementary Fig. 12) to this reaction caused an increase in the 8-ppm signal, supporting the idea that the new peak represents methyldehydrofosmidomycin (Fig. 5B). This conclusion is fully supported by the 1H NMR data (Supplementary Fig. 13) and HRMS detection of a molecule with the exact mass of methyldehydrofosmidomycin (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. 14A,B). Based on the rearrangement reaction catalyzed by γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenase, we expect that the third methyl moiety from trimethyl-2AEP is oxidized to formaldehyde. To test this, we employed a colorimetric assay, which showed enzyme dependent production of formaldehyde during the reaction (Supplementary Fig. 14C).

DISCUSSION DISCUSSION Novel bioactive natural products, such as dehydrofosmidomycin and FR-900098, are desperately needed to combat the rise of resistant organisms, while knowledge of their biosynthetic pathways enables the design of rational approaches for cost-effective production. The data presented here allow us to suggest a reasonable, although highly unusual biosynthetic pathway for dehydrofosmidomycin that differs substantially from that of the related molecule FR-900098 (Fig. 6). The first three steps of the pathway involve conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to 2AEP via DfmK (PepM), DfmL (phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase), and DfmM (aminotransferase). 2AEP is then converted to trimethyl-2AEP by the SAM-dependent methyltransferases DfmB and/or DfmC, with the most likely scenario involving the action of both enzymes in a sequential fashion. DfmD then catalyzes a series of unusual reactions to convert trimethyl-2AEP to methyldehydrofosmidomycin, releasing formaldehyde in the process. Due to their homology with characterized enzymes in the FR-900098 biosynthetic pathway, we propose that DfmH then catalyzes the transfer of a CMP group to methyldehydrofosmidomycin, followed by hydroxylation at the nitrogen by DfmG. All that then remains is removal of the CMP group, which is probably performed by the metallophosphoesterase DfmF, and oxidation of the methyl group to a formyl group. Regarding the latter, only two genes in the dfm cluster (dfmG and dfmD) encode proteins with homology to known oxidoreductases. Alternatively, this oxidation reaction could be performed by one of the remaining enzymes encoded in the cluster, DfmI or DfmJ, but we view this as unlikely, given their homology to nucleoside diphosphate kinases. Instead, we suggest that these genes are involved in self-resistance to phosphonate metabolites based on the role of a similar pair of nucleoside diphosphate kinases required for biosynthesis of the phosphonate antibiotic fosfomycin (42). In this regard, we also expect that DfmE will catalyze a dehydrofosmidomycin-resistant DXR reaction, providing an additional self-resistance mechanism. Finally, it should be noted that none of the genes in the dfm cluster appear to encode enzymes that would be able to reduce dehydrofosmidomycin to fosmidomycin. While this is consistent with our inability to detect fosmidomycin in either the native or the heterologous producers, it deepens the mystery of how this molecule was originally discovered.

The strikingly different biosynthetic pathways for FR-900098 and dehydrofosmidomycin show that the ability to produce these related molecules arose by convergent evolution, a rare occurrence in biology. Moreover, the observation that nature has independently arrived at the hydroxyaminophosphonate scaffold speaks to the potency of these bioactive molecules and the efficacy of DXR as a natural product target. Interestingly, this is the second documented occurrence of convergent evolution towards a bioactive phosphonate natural product, with fosfomycin being the first (43). Like FR-900098 and dehydrofosmidomycin, fosfomycin is also a three-carbon phosphonate. This peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibitor is synthesized via shortening of a four-carbon intermediate in Pseudomonas and by extension of a two-carbon intermediate in Streptomyces, which echoes the pattern seen during biosynthesis of FR-900098 and dehydrofosmidomycin. The initial step in all four pathways is synthesis of the three-carbon phosphonopyruvate. Due to the poor thermodynamics of this reaction, a subsequent, thermodynamically favorable reaction, which shortens or lengthens the carbon skeleton of the initial phosphonate product, is required to achieve net phosphonate synthesis. This, in turn, required the evolution of pathways to regenerate the three-carbon skeleton of the final product via interesting and unusual transformations.

The observation that dehydrofosmidomycin, rather than fosmidomycin, is the main product of the phosphonate biosynthetic gene cluster encoded by S. lavendulae, suggests that unsaturated congeners of this molecular family merit further study. Indeed, our data show that dehydrofosmidomycin is a potent antibiotic, with activity against important drug-resistant pathogens. During the course of this work, others developed a similar synthesis for dehydrofosmidomycin and showed that it is also a potent in vitro inhibitor of P. falciparum DXR (IC50 = 0.09 μM) with nearly identical activity to fosmidomycin (IC50 = 0.06 μM)(27). Excitingly, they found that dehydrofosmidomycin is >50-fold more active in P. falciparum growth inhibition assays compared to fosmidomycin, likely due to its improved membrane permeability (27). These data suggest that dehydrofosmidomycin is a very promising antibacterial and antimalarial candidate, perhaps with greater potential than the previously clinically investigated fosmidomycin. The observation that dehydrofosmidomycin, rather than fosmidomycin, is the main product of the phosphonate biosynthetic gene cluster encoded by S. lavendulae, suggests that unsaturated congeners of this molecular family merit further study.

Each reaction contained 12.5 μL of 2X GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega), 800 nM primers, 1 μL of colony resuspension, and nuclease free water to a final volume of 25 μL. Thermocyclers were operated under the following program: (i) initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min; (ii) 95 °C for 30 sec; (iii) 52 °C for 30 sec; (iv) 72 °C for 60 sec; (v) Repeat ii-iv for a total of 35 cycles; (vi) 72 °C for 5 min; (vii) hold at 4 °C. The products were separated by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel with the NEB 2-log ladder used as a control. Those that were successful (band at 471 bp) were then screened via PCR for the proper insertion site using the Ftest/k1 and Rtest/k2 primers using a similar procedure. If those were successful (bands at 604 and 997 bp, respectively), the colony was used to inoculate 5 mL of LB + 50 μg/mL kanamycin + 25 μg/mL apramycin that was grown overnight at 37 °C. The fosmid was isolated using a miniprep kit (Qiagen). Usually this gave quite low yields of the fosmid due to its low copy number. WM4489(21, 43) was transformed with the fosmid, and plated on LB + 50 μg/mL kanamycin. An overnight culture from a colony was then grown with 10 mM rhamnose to access greater quantities of the fosmid.

Successful transformants were identified using the same PCR described above. The electrocompetent BW26678 carrying the dehydrofosmidomycin fosmid were then transformed with the PCR products described above. SOC (1 mL) was added to the culture, and it was allowed to recover for 4 h at 37 °C on an angled roller drum before plating onto LB with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 25 μg/mL apramycin.
