 Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide
translocase
(MraYAA) from Aquifex aeolicus is the binding target for the nucleotide antibiotic muraymycin D2
(MD2). MraYAA in the presence of the MD2 ligand has been
crystallized and released, while the interactions between the ligand
and active-site residues remain less quantitatively and qualitatively
defined. We characterized theoretically the key residues involved
in noncovalent interactions with MD2 in the MraYAA active
site. We applied the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and natural
bond orbital analyses based on the density functional theory method
on the solved crystal structure of MraY with the MD2 to quantitatively
estimate the intermolecular interactions. The obtained results revealed
the presence of multiple hydrogen bonds in the investigated active
site with strength ranging from van der Waals to covalent limits.
Lys70, Asp193, Gly194, Asp196, Gly264, Ala321, Gln305, and His325
are key active-site residues interacting with MD2. Conventional and
unconventional hydrogen bonds in addition with charge–dipole
and dipole–dipole interactions contribute significantly to
stabilize the MD2 binding to the MraYAA active site. It
was also found that water molecules inside the active site have substantial
effects on its structure stability through hydrogen-bonding interactions
with MD2 and the interacting residues. Introduction Introduction Bacterial
peptidoglycan biosynthesis is vital for bacterial survival,
in which phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide translocase
(MraY) is one of the key players.1 MraY
transfers phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide (P-MurNAc-pp)
from UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (UM5A) to the carrier lipid undecaprenyl
phosphate (C55P) to yielding uridine monophosphate and undecaprenyl-pyrophosphoryl-MurNAc-pp,
also named lipid I, during an Mg2+-dependent group-transfer
reaction.2,3 MraY is one of the members of the polyisoprenyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosaminosugar-1-phosphate-transferase superfamily4 and is a promising drug target for natural-product
nucleoside antibiotics, such as muraymycins (Figure 1).5,6 Muraymycins are one
subclass of nucleoside antibiotics which act as competitive inhibitors
for the natural substrate UM5A of MraY.7,8 Bacterial

Na cacodylate (0.1 M, pH 5.6), MgCl2 (0.050 M), and PEG400
(40% w/v) under special thermodynamic conditions and under conditions
governed by the physicochemical laws. Before forming the crystal lattice,
all protein molecules dissolved in this crystallization solution experienced
the solvent effects of total water molecules existing in protein solution
drop and then formed a regular three-dimensional array in the unit
cells through the noncovalent intermolecular interactions with its
aqueous environment. It is worth mentioning that the water molecules
around this protein exerted their solvent effects on the individual
protein atoms not only in the solution state (protein drop) but also
in the crystal solid state. The crystal structure of MraYAA–MD2 solved at

to be about 69.22%, the
electron density map obtained from X-ray diffraction could detect
only nine constant water molecules of total water molecules existing

in addition with MD2. The first structural model (model I) was thereby
constructed, as shown in Figure 2. As already mentioned above, nine water molecules
were detected in this crystal structure, in which four of them are

corresponds to the N30–H30···Oδ1 H-bond
with a length of 1.38 Å and an angle of 157.28°. Additionally,
the values of ρBCP (0.1033 a.u.) and ∇2ρBCP (0.1891 a.u.) at the H30···Oδ1
BCP are highest in comparison with those of other bonds. Indeed, it
is the strongest H-bond that MD2 forms within the active site of MraYAA. It is reasonable to suggest that Asp196 is one of the crucial
residues of MraYAA–MD2 and it plays an essential

are of less concern in biological systems, their influences on the

because its ρBCP, ∇2ρBCP, and |EHB| values are largest
in comparison with the other unconventional H-bonds (Table 1). Although these types of H-bonds
are of less concern in biological systems, their influences on the
conservation and the stabilization of MD2 binding to the MraYAA active site are irrefutable. Figure 5Gly194 interacts with
the aminopropyl linker. The 5-aminoribose
participates in conventional and unconventional H-bonds with residues
Thr75, Asn190, Asp193, Phe262, Gly264, and Ser268. Figure 5Gly194 interacts with
the aminopropyl linker. The 5-aminoribose

Thr75, Asn190, Asp193, Phe262, Gly264, and Ser268. As depicted in Figure 2a, the uracil base ring is placed in a position of face-to-face
(stacked) conformation relative to the aromatic ring of Phe262. The
QTAIM analysis explicates that this particular geometrical arrangement
leads to the creation of a ring critical point (RCP) in the interior
of each ring and a cage critical point (CCP) in the enclosed space
between these two rings. The RCPs and CCP denote the occurrence of
the electrostatic interaction of the π···π
stacking type between the π electron clouds of these rings (Figure 4). The modulus of
the sum of π···π stacking interaction energies
between these rings is 65.07 kJ/mol. Thus, the face-to-face π-stacking
interaction of the aromatic ring of Phe262 with the uracil base of
MD2, tunicamycin, capuramycin, 3′-hydroxymureidomycin A, and
carbacaprazamycin influences significantly their stacking inside this
active site.41 In addition to these three
critical points, H37···Cε2 BCP exists between
the ribose ring and the aromatic ring of Phe262. Consequently, they
are involved in a weak unconventional C37–H37···Cε2
H-bond together (Table 1). On the other hand, the side chain of Phe262 is extended in the
position adjacent to the 5-aminoribose of the MD2 nucleoside (Figure 2a). Two HBCPs of
Hβ3···O23 and Hβ3···O24
are identified between them (Figure 5). Because the |EHB| (13.67
kJ/mol) of Cβ–Hβ3···O23 is greater
than that (8.53 kJ/mol) of Cβ– Hβ3···O24,
the former H-bond is stronger than the latter H-bond. As depicted in Figure 2a, the uracil base ring is placed in a position of face-to-face

kJ/mol) of Cβ–Hβ3···O23 is greater
than that (8.53 kJ/mol) of Cβ– Hβ3···O24,
the former H-bond is stronger than the latter H-bond. As displayed
in Figure 5, the nitrogen
atom of the 5-aminoribose donates its two hydrogens
to Oδ1, Oδ2, and Oγ of Asn190, Asp193, and Ser268,
respectively. It also formed H24···Oγ1 BCP with
Thr75 and H···O23 BCP with Gly264. Therefore, five
intermolecular HBCPs are created among these nuclei. Because the |EHB| (25.84 kJ/mol) of O24–H24···Oγ1
in the Mur–Thr75 pair is larger than that (17.23 kJ/mol) of
N20–H201···Oγ in the Mur–Ser268
pair, the former H-bond is stronger than the latter H-bond. The |EHB| (12.33 kJ/mol) of N20–H201···Oδ1
in the Mur–Asn190 pair is almost equal to that (12.94 kJ/mol)
of N20–H202···Oδ2 in Mur–Asp193;
therefore, the strengths of these two H-bonds are nearly identical.
The values of ρBCP (0.0621 a.u.), ∇2ρBCP (0.2736 a.u.), and |EHB| (92.26 kJ/mol) of H···O23 BCP demonstrate
that N–H···O23 in the Mur–Gly264 pair
is a strong H-bonding interaction, and it has a great importance in
MD2 binding to the MraYAA active site. As a consequence,
Gly264 is not only another key residue in this active site but also
a crucial amino acid in complex with capuramycin.41 As displayed

Gly264 is not only another key residue in this active site but also
a crucial amino acid in complex with capuramycin.41 As indicated in Table 1, 5-aminoribose formed three BCPs with the side chains
of
Asn190 and Asp193. One of them exists in the path connecting H192
and Oδ1 of Asn190 and the other two are in the path joining
Oδ2 of Asp193 with H191 and H22. Furthermore, two BPs begin
from carbonyl oxygens of Asn190 and Asp193 and terminate at H102 and
H111 of the aminopropyl linker, respectively, and H35···Oδ1
BCP is between the uracil base and Asp193 (Figure 4). Of these, C19–H191···Oδ2
with an |EHB| of 17.13 kJ/mol is a moderate
H-bond, whereas the other unconventional H-bonds are weak interactions. As indicated in Table 1, 5-aminoribose formed three BCPs with the side chains
of
Asn190 and Asp193. One of them exists in the path connecting H192

with an |EHB| of 17.13 kJ/mol is a moderate
H-bond, whereas the other unconventional H-bonds are weak interactions. The QTAIM analysis reveals that the nitrogen backbones of l-epicapreomycidine (N47) and l-valine (N50) of the peptide
portion of MD2 are proton donors to carbonyl oxygen of Ala321 (Figure 6). The values of
ρBCP and ∇2ρBCP in H47···O and H50···O BCPs demonstrate
that the N47–H47···O H-bond is much stronger
than the N50–H50···O H-bond (Table 1). Indeed, N47–H47···O
with a length of 1.45 Å, an angle of 124.07°, and an |EHB| of 137.31 kJ/mol is the second strongest
H-bond of MD2 in this active site. In addition to these H-bonds, the
H···H50 BP is also formed between them. Interaction
derived from linking two hydrogen atoms is characteristic of a specific
type of van der Waals interaction called hydrogen–hydrogen
bonding (H–H bonding) interaction.18 Furthermore, the O45 and H641 nuclei of l-epicapreomycidine
form two BPs of Hδ2···O45 and H641···Nδ1
with Pro322 and His325, respectively. The |EHB| (20.35 kJ/mol) of Cδ−Hδ2···O45
is higher than that (7.46 kJ/mol) of C64–H641···Nδ1.
Thus, l-epicapreomycidine has stronger H-bonding interaction
with Pro322 than His325. The QTAIM analysis recognizes a BCP between
O56 of l-valine and Hε21 of Gln305. The values of ρBCP (0.0596 a.u.), ∇2ρBCP (0.3020 a.u.), and |EHB| (90.50 kJ/mol)
of this BCP are indicative of the formation of the strong Nε2–Hε21···O56
H-bond in the Mur–Gln305 pair (Figure 6). Although mutation results did not prove
the importance of the role of Gln305 in MD2 binding to the MraYAA active site,6 our computational
findings demonstrate that the residues accompanying Ala321 are other
two crucial residues that play key roles in the binding stability
of its peptide portion to this active site through very strong H-bonds. The QTAIM analysis reveals that the nitrogen backbones of l-epicapreomycidine (N47) and l-valine (N50) of the peptide
portion of MD2 are proton donors to carbonyl oxygen of Ala321 (Figure 6). The values of

interaction in that BCP. Rozas et al.42 reported that the positive ∇2ρBCP and the negative HBCP values reflect
a partly covalent character of a pertinent H-bond. Our results indicate
that the HBCP values of the various HBCPs
become negative (Table 1). Thus, the fundamental natures of these interactions must be considered
as the intermediate between covalent and electrostatic characters.
Based on the ρHBCP values, we suggest that the strong
H-bonds of MD2 have to be included that are basically covalent and
partially electrostatic in nature, whereas its weak H-bonds have a
basically electrostatic character. The moderate H-bonds of MD2 are
a mixture of both covalent and electrostatic contributions where weakening
of the H-bond is accompanied by the decrease of the covalent part. As already mentioned above, the small positive value of ∇2ρBCP implies the presence of a closed-shell

inside the MraYAA–MD2 active site by the QTAIM analysis
are in agreement with the predicted H-bonds for this active site by
experimental findings.6 Based on our results,
the active site residues formed most of the H-bonds with uracil and
5-amino ribose; therefore, the nucleoside portion of MD2 is involved
in much more H-bonding interactions than its peptide portion. It is worthy to mention that the whole H-bonds that are detected

that electrons of lone pair Oδ2
of Asp193 are simultaneously transferred to the antibonding orbitals
of σC19–H191*, σC22–H22*, and σN20–H202* in 5-aminoribose and a CT also occurred
from its nO into σC11–H111* in the aminopropyl linker. It is clearly
evident that the electron-transfer process decreases the electronic
occupancy of an electron donor and increases the occupation number
of an electron acceptor. The amount of CT, qCT, between the interacting orbitals is approximately proportional
to the associated stabilization energy, eq 1, and is calculated as223 The NBO analysis indicates

the cited orbitals weakly interact with each other. Moreover, the
CT interactions of nO42 → σCα–Hα3*, nO32 → σCα–Hα*, nO32 → σNδ2–Hδ22*, nO23 → σCβ–Hβ3*, and nNδ1 →
σC64–H641* in Mur–Gly194, Mur–Asp196, Mur–Asn255,
Mur–Phe262, and Mur–His325 pairs, respectively, have
very low qCT and E(2) values. Thus, similar to the QTAIM results, the NBO analysis
also emphasizes that they are weak interactions. As shown in Table 2, the qCT and E(2) values of these CT interactions are very small; therefore,

Mur–Phe262, and Mur–His325 pairs, respectively, have
very low qCT and E(2) values. Thus, similar to the QTAIM results, the NBO analysis
also emphasizes that they are weak interactions. The NBO analysis
reveals that σN20–H201* accepts separately the qCT values of 0.0040 and 0.0029 e from the lone pair orbitals
of Oγ in Ser268 and Oδ1 in Asn190, respectively. E(2) (13.47 kJ/mol) of the nOγ → σN20–H201* interaction is greater than that (10.75 kJ/mol)
of the nOδ1 → σN20–H201* interaction. Thus,
5-aminoribose has a stronger CT interaction with Ser268 than Asn190.
As seen in Table 2,
the Nζ–Hζ2···O33 H-bond is the result
of a CT (0.0226 e) from the nO33 of the uracil base into
σNζ–Hζ2* of Lys70. The NBO analysis
reveals that σN20–H201* accepts separately the qCT values of 0.0040 and 0.0029 e from the lone pair orbitals
of Oγ in Ser268 and Oδ1 in Asn190, respectively. E(2) (13.47 kJ/mol) of the nOγ → σN20–H201* interaction is greater than that (10.75 kJ/mol)

5-aminoribose has a stronger CT interaction with Ser268 than Asn190.

the Nζ–Hζ2···O33 H-bond is the result
of a CT (0.0226 e) from the nO33 of the uracil base into
σNζ–Hζ2* of Lys70. The great E(2) value (65.56 kJ/mol)
of the nO33 → σNζ–Hζ2* interaction is indicative of the existence
of a relatively strong attractive interaction between these orbitals.
O24–H24···Oγ1 in the Mur–Thr75
pair arises from the CT interaction of nOγ1 →
σO24–H24* with E(2) of 21.88 kJ/mol. The
nO26 of the ribose ring overlaps with σCα–Hα2* of Gly194, resulting in the formation of Cα-Hα2···O26
in the Mur–Gly194 pair. The nO26 → σCα–Hα2* interaction is the strongest CT interaction of the C–H···B
kind because its E(2) value (24.81 kJ/mol)
is highest in comparison with the other unconventional interactions
(Table 2). This finding
is in agreement with the |EHB| prediction
for this interaction. The great E(2) value (65.56 kJ/mol)
of the nO33 → σNζ–Hζ2* interaction is indicative of the existence
of a relatively strong attractive interaction between these orbitals.

is in agreement with the |EHB| prediction
for this interaction. As mentioned earlier (Section 3.1), MD2 forms the strongest
H-bond with Asp196 in this
active site. The N30–H30···Oδ1 H-bond
occurs as a consequence of electron transfer from the nOδ1 of Asp196 into σN30–H30* of the uracil base. The nOδ1 → σN30–H30* CT interaction has the largest values of qCT (0.1219 e) and E(2) (349.62 kJ/mol) compared to other interactions. The nO →σN47–H47*, nO23 → σN–H*, and
nO56 → σNε2–Hε21* interactions in Mur–Ala321, Mur–Gly264,
and Mur–Gln305 pairs, respectively, also have very large qCT and E(2) values
(Table 2). Consequently,
there are very strong attractive interactions between the interacting
local orbitals in each cited Mur–residue pair, resulting in
the formation of these four very strong H-bonds in this active site.
Accordingly, we suggest that the CT interactions of residues Asp196,
Gly264, Gln305, and Ala321 with MD2 play roles to some extent in its
stabilization and conservation inside this binding site. As mentioned earlier (Section 3.1), MD2 forms the strongest

in Mur–Residue Pairs The QTAIM and NBO analyses established
only some residues of the first structural model that are capable
of forming H-bonds with MD2. As known, a single proton (positive charge)
becomes localized on the Nζ atom of Lys and the imidazole ring
of His is partially protonated. There is a single delocalized electron
(negative charge) between Oδ1 and Oδ2 atoms of Asp. Therefore,
Mur–Asp193 and Mur–Asp196 are negatively charged pairs,
whereas Mur–Lys70 and Mur–His325 are positively charged
pairs. Hence, the electrostatic interactions of charge–dipole
and dipole–dipole types are expected to take place in these
charged Mur–residue pairs. Besides, Mur–Thr70, Mur–Asn190,
Mur–Asn255, Mur–Ser268, and Mur–Gln305 are polar
Mur–residue pairs because of the presence of side-chain hydroxyl
groups in Thr and Ser as well as the side-chain carboxamide group
in Gln and Asn. Consequently, the dipole–dipole interaction
makes an important contribution to the intermolecular interactions
of each polar pair. The nonpolar side chains of residues Gly194, Phe262,
Gly264, Ala321, and Pro322 can be induced by the dipole moment of
MD2, resulting in a dipole–induced-dipole interaction contribution
to intermolecular interactions of each Mur–residue pair. The QTAIM and NBO analyses established

model incapable of forming H-bonds with MD2. However, it is expected
that their side chains can interact with different parts of MD2 through
other types of noncovalent interactions. Because Arg possesses a guanidine
group, the Mur–Arg320 pair is a positively charged pair. Hence,
residues Asp265 and Arg320 can interact with Mur through charge–dipole
and dipole–dipole interactions. Nonpolar side chains of residues
Leu191, Leu195, Met263, Val302, and Ile306 can participate in dipole–induced–dipole

Leu191, Leu195, Met263, Val302, and Ile306 can participate in dipole–induced–dipole
interactions as well as van der Waals interactions of the hydrophobic
type with MD2. Our results indicated the other residues of the first structural
model incapable of forming H-bonds with MD2. However, it is expected
that their side chains can interact with different parts of MD2 through
other types of noncovalent interactions. Because Arg possesses a guanidine
group, the Mur–Arg320 pair is a positively charged pair. Hence,
residues Asp265 and Arg320 can interact with Mur through charge–dipole
and dipole–dipole interactions. Nonpolar side chains of residues
Leu191, Leu195, Met263, Val302, and Ile306 can participate in dipole–induced–dipole
interactions as well as van der Waals interactions of the hydrophobic
type with MD2. Finally, we conclude that not only H-bonding
interactions but also
van der Waals and electrostatic interactions cooperatively locate
MD2 inside this active site because these interactions concomitant
with H-bonds play very important roles in conserving MD2 binding to
MraYAA and stabilizing its active site. Finally, we conclude that not only H-bonding
interactions but also
van der Waals and electrostatic interactions cooperatively locate
MD2 inside this active site because these interactions concomitant
with H-bonds play very important roles in conserving MD2 binding to
MraYAA and stabilizing its active site. Finally, we conclude that not only H-bonding
interactions but also
van der Waals and electrostatic interactions cooperatively locate
MD2 inside this active site because these interactions concomitant

MraYAA and stabilizing its active site. QTAIM and NBO Analyses on the Second Structural

Model As mentioned earlier (Section 2), the MraYAA–MD2 complex
was simulated in a water box under periodic boundary conditions. Our
MD outcomes showed that the positions of the added water molecules
to around and inside this protein complex were changed in the different
frames of simulation, but the locations of the key crystallographic
water molecules, however, were kept nearby the MraYAA–MD2
active site without canceling out during the MD process, implicating
that these water molecules play critical roles in MD2 binding. The
first, third, sixth, and eighth molecules of water are situated near
the active site and are surrounded by some of its residues as well
as the nucleoside portion of MD2 (model II in Figure 3). These molecules play important roles in
maintaining and stabilizing the positions of MD2 and residues inside
this active site because they are able to form H-bonds with both of
them. The QTAIM and NBO results corresponding to the formation of
H-bonds in the second structural model are gathered in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. As mentioned earlier (Section 2), the MraYAA–MD2 complex

participates in an unconventional H-bond with Ala199 and two conventional
H-bonds with Asp193 and Ala199 (Figure 7). The amounts of ρBCP, ∇2ρBCP, and |EHB| at the paths of H···O and Hβ2···O
in Wt1–Ala199 pair confirm that N–H···O
is a moderate H-bond, whereas Cβ–Hβ2···O
is a weak interaction (Table 3). The topological parameters on H2···Oδ1
BCP in the Wt1–Asp193 pair, namely, ρBCP =
0.1519 a.u., ∇2ρBCP = 0.1256 a.u.,
and HBCP = −0.3910 a.u., signify
the presence of a very strong H-bond with a covalent character in
this pair. O–H1···Oδ1 emerges as a consequence
of a great CT (0.1148 e) from the nOδ1 of Asp193
into antibonding σO–H1* of Wt1. It is evident from the results in Tables 3 and 4 that the highest values of |EHB| (355.92 kJ/mol) and E(2) (241.50 kJ/mol)
belong to O–H1···Oδ1 H-bond and nOδ1 → σO–H1* CT interaction, respectively. Hence,
it is the strongest H-bonding interaction in the second structural

0.1519 a.u., ∇2ρBCP = 0.1256 a.u.,
and HBCP = −0.3910 a.u., signify
the presence of a very strong H-bond with a covalent character in
this pair. O–H1···Oδ1 emerges as a consequence
of a great CT (0.1148 e) from the nOδ1 of Asp193
into antibonding σO–H1* of Wt1. It is evident from the results in Tables 3 and 4 that the highest values of |EHB| (355.92 kJ/mol) and E(2) (241.50 kJ/mol)
belong to O–H1···Oδ1 H-bond and nOδ1 → σO–H1* CT interaction, respectively. Hence,
it is the strongest H-bonding interaction in the second structural
model and has a main contribution to the MraYAA–MD2–water
interaction. Figure 7Water molecules participate in H-bonding interactions

(Wt3) overlaps
with the antibonding orbitals of σN–H* and σCβ–Hβ3* in Met263. There is also an orbital
overlap between its σO–H1* and nOδ2 in Asp193. These
orbital overlaps result in the formation of the H-bonds of N–H···O
and Cβ–Hβ3···O in Wt3–Met263
pair as well as O–H1···Oδ2 in Wt3–Asp193
pair (Figure 7). Topological
parameters and stabilization energies indicate that Wt3 has the strongest
H-bonding interaction with Met263 because N–H···O
has the largest values of |EHB| (76.74
kJ/mol) and E(2) (142.21 kJ/mol) with
respect to other interactions of Wt3 (Tables 3 and 4). This strong
H-bond with a length of 1.58 Å is predominantly covalent in nature.
The |EHB| (32.42 kJ/mol) of Cβ–Hβ3···O
is more than twice that (13.91 kJ/mol) of O–H1···Oδ2,
hence the unconventional H-bond is stronger than the conventional
H-bond. As a result, Met263 plays a critical role in MraYAA–MD2–Wt3 interaction through these two H-bonds. The oxygen lone pair of the third water molecule
(Wt3) overlaps
with the antibonding orbitals of σN–H* and σCβ–Hβ3* in Met263. There is also an orbital
overlap between its σO–H1* and nOδ2 in Asp193. These
orbital overlaps result in the formation of the H-bonds of N–H···O
and Cβ–Hβ3···O in Wt3–Met263
pair as well as O–H1···Oδ2 in Wt3–Asp193
pair (Figure 7). Topological

H-bonding interaction with Met263 because N–H···O
has the largest values of |EHB| (76.74
kJ/mol) and E(2) (142.21 kJ/mol) with

H-bond with a length of 1.58 Å is predominantly covalent in nature.
The |EHB| (32.42 kJ/mol) of Cβ–Hβ3···O
is more than twice that (13.91 kJ/mol) of O–H1···Oδ2,
hence the unconventional H-bond is stronger than the conventional
H-bond. As a result, Met263 plays a critical role in MraYAA–MD2–Wt3 interaction through these two H-bonds. The oxygen lone pair of the third water molecule

pair (Figure 7). Topological

H-bond with a length of 1.58 Å is predominantly covalent in nature.
The |EHB| (32.42 kJ/mol) of Cβ–Hβ3···O
is more than twice that (13.91 kJ/mol) of O–H1···Oδ2,
hence the unconventional H-bond is stronger than the conventional
H-bond. As a result, Met263 plays a critical role in MraYAA–MD2–Wt3 interaction through these two H-bonds. The QTAIM analysis finds a BCP in the path connecting oxygen of
the sixth water molecule (Wt6) to Hε3 of Met263. The Hε3···O
BCP has the small values of ρBCP (0.0124 a.u.), ∇2ρBCP (0.0394 a.u.), and |EHB| (11.97 kJ/mol). Therefore, Met263 weakly interacts
with Wt6. The oxygen of Wt6 is also linked to the nuclei of H and
Hβ in Ile200 by two HBCPs. Although both H-bonds in the Wt6–Ile200
pair are weak interactions, N–H···O is somewhat
stronger than Cβ–Hβ···O because
the |EHB| (15.78 kJ/mol) of conventional
H-bond is larger than that (8.99 kJ/mol) of unconventional H-bond.
Besides, Oδ1 of Asn255 acts as a proton acceptor in the interaction
with H2 of Wt6. The relatively large values of ρBCP (0.0291 a.u), ∇2ρBCP (0.1145
a.u), and |EHB| (34.99 kJ/mol) of H2···Oδ1
BCP affirm that Wt6 has the strongest H-bonding interaction with Asn255.
This H-bond is the result of the CT interaction of nOδ1 → σO–H2* with a qCT of
0.0108 e and an E(2) of 37.57 kJ/mol. The QTAIM analysis finds a BCP in the path connecting oxygen of
the sixth water molecule (Wt6) to Hε3 of Met263. The Hε3···O
BCP has the small values of ρBCP (0.0124 a.u.), ∇2ρBCP (0.0394 a.u.), and |EHB| (11.97 kJ/mol). Therefore, Met263 weakly interacts

BCP affirm that Wt6 has the strongest H-bonding interaction with Asn255.

BCP affirm that Wt6 has the strongest H-bonding interaction with Asn255.
This H-bond is the result of the CT interaction of nOδ1 → σO–H2* with a qCT of
0.0108 e and an E(2) of 37.57 kJ/mol. In addition to Wt1 and Wt3, the eighth water molecule (Wt8) also
interacts with Asp193 through the moderate H-bond of O–H1···O
(Table 3). The appearance
of this H-bond is due to the CT interaction of nO →
σO–H2* with an E(2) of 22.76 kJ/mol
and a qCT of 0.0066 e. The antibonding
σO–H1* of Wt8 weakly attracts the nO of Leu191 and H-bond
of O–H1···O with an |EHB| of 6.34 kJ/mol is formed between them (Figure 7). There are two HBCPs that
connect the oxygen nucleus of Wt8 to the Hε2 nuclei in His324
and His325 (Table 3). These H-bonds are the results of the CTs of 0.0009 e and 0.0143
e from the nO of Wt8 into the antibonding orbitals of σNε2–Hε2* in His324 and His325, respectively. The |EHB| (21.97 kJ/mol) of Nε2–Hε2···O
in the Wt8–His325 pair is more than 3 times larger than that
(6.00 kJ/mol) in the Wt8–His324 pair. Consequently, Wt8 has
the stronger H-bonding interaction with His325 than His324. In addition to Wt1 and Wt3, the eighth water molecule (Wt8) also
interacts with Asp193 through the moderate H-bond of O–H1···O
(Table 3). The appearance
of this H-bond is due to the CT interaction of nO →
σO–H2* with an E(2) of 22.76 kJ/mol
and a qCT of 0.0066 e. The antibonding
σO–H1* of Wt8 weakly attracts the nO of Leu191 and H-bond
of O–H1···O with an |EHB| of 6.34 kJ/mol is formed between them (Figure 7). There are two HBCPs that
connect the oxygen nucleus of Wt8 to the Hε2 nuclei in His324
and His325 (Table 3). These H-bonds are the results of the CTs of 0.0009 e and 0.0143
e from the nO of Wt8 into the antibonding orbitals of σNε2–Hε2* in His324 and His325, respectively. The |EHB| (21.97 kJ/mol) of Nε2–Hε2···O
in the Wt8–His325 pair is more than 3 times larger than that
(6.00 kJ/mol) in the Wt8–His324 pair. Consequently, Wt8 has
the stronger H-bonding interaction with His325 than His324. In addition to Wt1 and Wt3, the eighth water molecule (Wt8) also
interacts with Asp193 through the moderate H-bond of O–H1···O
(Table 3). The appearance
of this H-bond is due to the CT interaction of nO →

in the Wt8–His325 pair is more than 3 times larger than that
(6.00 kJ/mol) in the Wt8–His324 pair. Consequently, Wt8 has
the stronger H-bonding interaction with His325 than His324. The O32 lone pair of the uracil base transfers the charges of 0.0005
and 0.0113 e into the antibonding orbitals of σO–H2* in Wt1
and Wt3, respectively. There are also two CT interactions of nO → σO23–H23* and nO → σC35–H35* between
MD2 and Wt3. The nO42 of the aminopropyl linker overlaps
with the antibonding σO–H2* in Wt8. Accordingly, MD2 is involved
in three H-bonds of O23–H23···O, O–H2···O32,
and C35–H35···O with Wt3 as well as two H-bonds
of O–H2···O32 and O–H2···O42
with Wt1 and Wt8, respectively (Figure 7). Among these H-bonds, O–H2···O32
in the Mur–Wt3 pair is the strongest H-bonding interaction
because it has the largest values of ρBCP (0.0216
a.u.), ∇2ρBCP (0.0635 a.u.), and
|EHB| (22.87 kJ/mol) in comparison with
four weak interactions of MD2 (Table 3). The O32 lone pair of the uracil base transfers the charges of 0.0005
and 0.0113 e into the antibonding orbitals of σO–H2* in Wt1
and Wt3, respectively. There are also two CT interactions of nO → σO23–H23* and nO → σC35–H35* between
MD2 and Wt3. The nO42 of the aminopropyl linker overlaps

and C35–H35···O with Wt3 as well as two H-bonds
of O–H2···O32 and O–H2···O42
with Wt1 and Wt8, respectively (Figure 7). Among these H-bonds, O–H2···O32
in the Mur–Wt3 pair is the strongest H-bonding interaction
because it has the largest values of ρBCP (0.0216
a.u.), ∇2ρBCP (0.0635 a.u.), and

of O–H2···O32 and O–H2···O42
with Wt1 and Wt8, respectively (Figure 7). Among these H-bonds, O–H2···O32
in the Mur–Wt3 pair is the strongest H-bonding interaction

a.u.), ∇2ρBCP (0.0635 a.u.), and
|EHB| (22.87 kJ/mol) in comparison with
four weak interactions of MD2 (Table 3). Our results also demonstrate that Wt1 plays
concurrently both donor
and acceptor roles in the formation of two moderate O–H···O
H-bonds with Wt6 (Figure 7). O–H1···O that is the consequence
of the nO → σO–H2* interaction with a qCT of 0.0139 e and an E(2) of 39.29 kJ/mol is stronger than O–H1···O
with an |EHB| of (33.15 kJ/mol) and an E(2) of 19.50 kJ/mol. Our results also demonstrate that Wt1 plays
concurrently both donor
and acceptor roles in the formation of two moderate O–H···O
H-bonds with Wt6 (Figure 7). O–H1···O that is the consequence

H-bonding interactions, intermolecular interactions
in Wt1–Asp193, Wt3–Asp193, Wt8–Asp193, Wt8–His324,
and Wt8–His325 pairs also include charge–dipole and
dipole–dipole interactions. Intermolecular interactions of
other Wt–residue pairs as well as Mur–Wt pairs consist
of dipole–dipole and dipole–induced–dipole interactions
as well. Thus, we conclude that these water molecules play fundamental
roles in positioning residues and locating the conserved nucleoside
portion of MD2 within this active site by electrostatic, conventional,
and unconventional H-bonding interactions. In addition to the
H-bonding interactions, intermolecular interactions
in Wt1–Asp193, Wt3–Asp193, Wt8–Asp193, Wt8–His324,

studied to identify the physical natures of the intermolecular interactions
involved in its active site at the M06-2X/6-31G** level. According
to the site mutations in the active site, ITC, and kinetic results,
our computational analysis data shed new light on critical residues.
The QTAIM and NBO analyses have been performed on this active site
for better understanding of intermolecular interactions. Our results
specified that Asp196 is one of the critical residues of MraYAA–MD2 that interact strongly with the uracil base of
MD2 through an H-bond with dominantly covalent in nature. Gly264 is
another important residue that forms a strong H-bond with 5-aminoribose
of MD2. Two very strong H-bonds of MD2 with residues Gln305 and Ala321
are mainly responsible to stabilize its peptide portion in this active
site. The π···π interaction of the aromatic
ring of Phe262 plays an important role in stacking uracil base of
MD2 within this active site. Uridine participates in two moderate
H-bonds with Gly194 where both are the strongest unconventional H-bonding
interactions of MD2. In summary, MraYAA–MD2 has been computationally

are of great importance
in this active site stabilization. Residues Asp265 and Arg320 are
unable to participate in CT interactions with MD2, but they can ensure
its binding to MraYAA mainly by electrostatic interactions,
especially charge–dipole and dipole–dipole. Nonpolar
side chains of residues Leu191, Gly194, Leu195, Phe262, Met263, Gly264,
Val302, Ile306, Ala321, and Pro322 can interact with the different
parts of MD2 via dipole–induced–dipole and hydrophobic
interactions. In addition to H-bonds, residues Lys70, Asp193, Asp196,

Asp193 and Wt1 is the
strongest protein–water H-bond in this active site and this
interaction has significant effects on its structure stability. Met263
plays a role in MraYAA–MD2–Wt3 interactions
through a strong N–H···O H-bond and a moderate
Cβ–Hβ3···O H-bond. Wt6 has three
weak H-bonding interactions with Met263 and Ile200 and a moderate
H-bond with Asn255. Wt1 and Wt6 molecules assist in stabilizing the
active site through two moderate water–water interactions.
Wt8 forms two weak H-bonds with Leu191 and His324 and two moderate

most of the H-bonds around the nucleoside

complex. This finding indicates that the nucleoside portion plays
more important roles in MD2 positioning in this active site than the
