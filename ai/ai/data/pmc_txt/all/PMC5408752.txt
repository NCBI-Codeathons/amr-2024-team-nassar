 Lanthipeptides
are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally
modified peptides (RiPPs) that display a wide variety of biological
activities, from antimicrobial to antiallodynic. Lanthipeptides that
display antimicrobial activity are called lantibiotics. The post-translational
modification reactions of lanthipeptides include dehydration of Ser
and Thr residues to dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, a transformation
that is carried out in three unique ways in different classes of lanthipeptides.
In a cyclization process, Cys residues then attack the dehydrated
residues to generate the lanthionine and methyllanthionine thioether
cross-linked amino acids from which lanthipeptides derive their name.
The resulting polycyclic peptides have constrained conformations that
confer their biological activities. After installation of the characteristic
thioether cross-links, tailoring enzymes introduce additional post-translational
modifications that are unique to each lanthipeptide and that fine-tune
their activities and/or stability. This review focuses on studies
published over the past decade that have provided much insight into
the mechanisms of the enzymes that carry out the post-translational
modifications. Introduction Introduction The name lanthipeptide
is a short-hand nomenclature for lanthionine-containing
peptides,1 with lanthipeptides having antimicrobial
activities historically called lantibiotics.2 A lanthionine is a bis-amino-bis acid in which two alanine residues
are linked by a thioether group that connects their β-carbons
(Figure 1). When incorporated
into a peptide chain via both the amino and acid groups, a lanthionine
results in a thioether cross-link. Installation of lanthionine residues
is accomplished through enzymatic post-translational modifications
on peptide substrates. Although genes encoding homologues of lanthipeptide
biosynthetic enzymes are also present in some archaea and in higher
eukaryotes including mammals,3,4 lanthipeptide detection
and isolation is thus far restricted to bacteria. The increase in
the number of characterized lanthipeptides as a result of the bacterial
genome sequencing projects has led to the realization that their functions
are not limited to antimicrobial activities but also include antifungal,5 morphogenetic,6,7 antiviral,8 antinociceptive,9 and
antiallodynic functions.10 As a result,
lanthipeptide derivatives are undergoing therapeutic evaluation11−25 and have been used for imaging applications.26−34 Lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters are particularly found
in the genomes of many genera of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria,
Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria.35−37 The name lanthipeptide

that are characteristic for lanthipeptides. Under each chemical structure
is shown a shorthand notation used in this review. At present, two
different diastereomers of both Lan and MeLan have been found in natural
lanthipeptides, whereas for Dhb and Lab only one diastereomer has
been reported thus far. A methyl-substituted Lab (MeLab) has recently
been identified and its stereochemistry is unknown. In all drawings

acid. The mechanism by which the thioether
cross-links are formed is
what unifies this family of compounds. For all lanthipeptides, these
linkages are introduced by a post-translational modification process
that first involves the dehydration of Ser and Thr residues to 2,3-didehydroalanine
(Dha) and 2,3-didehydrobutyrine (Dhb) residues, respectively (Figure 2). As discussed in
this review, the manner of dehydration can be quite different, which
is one of the criteria for dividing lanthipeptides into different
classes. The thioether structure is then generated by 1,4-conjugate
addition of a Cys onto a dehydro amino acid. The resultant enolate
can be protonated to produce either a lanthionine (Lan) from Ser or
a methyllanthionine (MeLan) from Thr (Figure 2). Alternatively, the initially formed enolate
can attack another dehydro amino acid to produce a carbon–carbon
cross-link and a second enolate. Upon protonation, the structure that
now introduces two cross-links and contains an α,α-disubstituted
amino acid at its center is called a labionin (Lab) when formed from
one Cys and two Ser residues,10 or methyllabionin
(MeLab) when formed from one Cys, a central Thr, and an N-terminal
Ser (Figures 1 and 2).9 At present, no labionin-like
structures have been reported in which the electrophile in the second
conjugate addition was a Dhb. The lanthipeptide family encompasses
any peptide containing a (methyl)lanthionine or a (methyl)labionin
provided it is made by dehydration of Ser/Thr and subsequent attack
by a Cys residue onto a dehydro amino acid. Thioether cross-links
are also found in other peptide natural products, but their biosynthesis
does not involve this specific sequence of events and they have therefore
not been included in the lanthipeptide family.1 The mechanism by which the thioether

for Lan and four diastereomers for MeLan and Lab (when generated from
two Dha). In practice, thus far both diastereomers of Lan are indeed
found in naturally occurring lanthipeptides, but only two of the four
MeLan stereoisomers and one of the four Lab diastereomers have been
observed (Figure 1).
We emphasize that this situation may change, since for the majority
of lanthipeptides the stereochemistry has not been determined, and
only very recently was it recognized that more than one stereochemistry
can be generated for Lan/MeLan.38 In principle, the conjugate addition process can form two

on the stereochemistry at the α-carbons of the former Ser/Thr
and Cys residues. We assign as L the stereochemistry that has the
original side chain in the same position as in Ser/Thr/Cys and as
D the stereochemistry in which the side chain occupies the epimeric
position. Thus, (2S,6R)-Lan will
be referred to as DL-Lan (D configuration at the former Ser/Thr and
L configuration at the former Cys), and (2S,4S,8R)-labionin will be referred to as LDL
(Figure 1). This nomenclature
has the advantage that it immediately shows the net stereochemistry
of the attack of the enolate intermediate onto the electrophile (proton
for Lan and MeLan; Dha for Lab). For D stereochemistry this attack
is on the opposite face from where the original α-proton was
located in Ser/Thr. In this review we will use a stereochemical nomenclature that focuses

Modified Peptides (RiPPs) Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-Translationally
Modified Peptides (RiPPs) Lanthipeptides are members of the
rapidly expanding RiPP family of natural products. The genome sequencing
efforts of the past decade have revealed that many classes of peptide
natural products that were initially believed to be made by nonribosomal
peptide synthetases are in fact made via a ribosomally synthesized
precursor peptide that is then heavily post-translationally modified.1 The direct link between the gene encoding the
precursor peptide and the final product renders RiPPs as low-hanging
fruits for genome mining exercises, because to a large extent the
general shapes of the final structure can be predicted. Based on the
frequency of their gene clusters in the currently available genomes,
lanthipeptides appear to be the largest group of RiPPs,112−115 although this conclusion may be biased by the genomes that have
been sequenced thus far. Whereas comprehensive reviews of lanthipeptides
in the mid 2000s discussed compounds that were all discovered via
activity-based purification,44,45 many of the compounds
discussed in this review were discovered by applying genome mining
approaches35,116−123 to lanthipeptide discovery. For these molecules, the biosynthetic
gene cluster was known before the compound, and the knowledge of the
cluster was often used to obtain the lanthipeptide.124−139 In addition to the high suitability of RiPPs for genome mining,

of post-translational modifications is diverse,1,140−143 the overall biosynthetic pathways of RiPPs have a key common feature.
They almost always involve a precursor peptide that is much larger
than the final product, which is generated from the core peptide (Figure 3). The additional
sequence can be located at the N-terminus (a leader peptide),144 the C-terminus (a follower peptide),145−148 or at both sides of the core peptide (recognition sequences).149 These additional appendages that do not end
up in the final products have proven to be critical recognition sites
for many of the biosynthetic enzymes.144,150,151 The separation of substrate recognition from the
sites where the post-translational modifications take place have given
RiPP biosynthetic systems unique properties of very high substrate
tolerance. Indeed, as described in section 4.1, lanthipeptide core peptides can be hypervariable
and yet be substrates of a single enzyme.129 These properties provide even more tantalizing opportunities for
engineering. Although the spectrum

have been undertaken to systematically classify the various lanthipeptides,
from efforts that looked at the final structures39 to schemes that focused on the biosynthetic machinery.153 In this review we adopt the latter, updated
with classes that were discovered after introduction of the initial
classification scheme, but we recognize that already exceptions of
currently structurally uncharacterized lanthipeptides can be found
in the sequenced genomes. As discussed in this review, at present
the distinct mechanisms of the dehydration reaction distinguish class
I–IV. As more and more genomes are sequenced, it is highly
likely that a single classification scheme may not be possible, as
Nature has clearly shuffled biosynthetic genes, not only between lanthipeptide
classes, but even across different RiPP families (see sections 2.2 and 4.1). Nevertheless, it is clear that 3–4 quite different
strategies are used to biosynthesize the currently known lanthipeptides,
and subdividing this very large family of compounds by their biosynthetic
logic remains a useful means for classification. Many attempts

nisin produced by Lactococcus lactis, the founding
member of the lanthipeptide class of natural products, was discovered
in 1928 as a substance that inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus
bulgaricus.(154) Although nisin
was initially incorrectly suggested to slow acid development in cheese,
subsequent demonstration of broad-spectrum bactericidal activity resulted
in renewed interest in the 1940s for its use in food preservation.
Investigations into its structure elucidation were instigated with
the identification of the α,β-unsaturated amino acids
Dha and Dhb in nisin155 and in subtilin,156 a structurally closely related lanthipeptide
produced by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Subsequent
efforts ultimately culminated in the determination of the chemical
structure of nisin by Gross and Morell in 1971 (Figure 4).157 Concurrently,
Ingram observed that the levels of incorporation of radioactive Cys
into nisin in cultures of L. lactis correlated with
the addition of protein synthesis inhibitors,158 and proposed a ribosomal mechanism for lanthipeptide production
wherein Dha and Dhb are formed through the dehydration of Ser and
Thr, respectively, and subsequent intramolecular 1,4-conjugate addition
of Cys onto the dehydro amino acids would afford the characteristic
Lan and MeLan rings. Confirmation of a ribosomal origin for lanthipeptides
was firmly established in the late 1980s as sequences of several lantibiotic
biosynthetic clusters revealed the presence of genes that encode for
peptidic precursors of lanthipeptides, such as those for epidermin,2 subtilin,159 nisin,160−162 and gallidermin.163 Importantly, each
of these gene sequences codes for peptides that contain an N-terminal
leader sequence that is absent in the final products and a C-terminal
core sequence that contains codons for Ser, Thr, and Cys at the sites
of the post-translational modifications in the final products. The class I lantibiotic
nisin produced by Lactococcus lactis, the founding
member of the lanthipeptide class of natural products, was discovered
in 1928 as a substance that inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus

was initially incorrectly suggested to slow acid development in cheese,
subsequent demonstration of broad-spectrum bactericidal activity resulted
in renewed interest in the 1940s for its use in food preservation.
Investigations into its structure elucidation were instigated with
the identification of the α,β-unsaturated amino acids
Dha and Dhb in nisin155 and in subtilin,156 a structurally closely related lanthipeptide
produced by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Subsequent
efforts ultimately culminated in the determination of the chemical
structure of nisin by Gross and Morell in 1971 (Figure 4).157 Concurrently,
Ingram observed that the levels of incorporation of radioactive Cys
into nisin in cultures of L. lactis correlated with
the addition of protein synthesis inhibitors,158 and proposed a ribosomal mechanism for lanthipeptide production
wherein Dha and Dhb are formed through the dehydration of Ser and
Thr, respectively, and subsequent intramolecular 1,4-conjugate addition
of Cys onto the dehydro amino acids would afford the characteristic
Lan and MeLan rings. Confirmation of a ribosomal origin for lanthipeptides
was firmly established in the late 1980s as sequences of several lantibiotic
biosynthetic clusters revealed the presence of genes that encode for
peptidic precursors of lanthipeptides, such as those for epidermin,2 subtilin,159 nisin,160−162 and gallidermin.163 Importantly, each
of these gene sequences codes for peptides that contain an N-terminal
leader sequence that is absent in the final products and a C-terminal
core sequence that contains codons for Ser, Thr, and Cys at the sites
of the post-translational modifications in the final products. The class I lantibiotic
nisin produced by Lactococcus lactis, the founding
member of the lanthipeptide class of natural products, was discovered
in 1928 as a substance that inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus

consists of five thioether linkages
that define rings A-E, along with one Dhb and two Dha residues (Figure 4). The configurations
of the thioether rings were determined by reductive desulfurization,
which yielded D- and L-Ala from rings containing Lan, and D-α-aminobutyric
acid (D-Abu) and L-Ala from rings containing MeLan.157 Comparison of the retention times with authentic samples
identified the S-configuration at the β-position
of the latter.164 These data established
the stereochemistry of (2S,6R) for
the Lan residue and (2S,3S,6R) for the MeLan residues in nisin (Figures 1 and 4). To date,
all known structures of class I lanthipeptides have the same stereochemistry,

bestows upon lanthipeptides the ability to recognize specific molecular
targets with high specificity and selectivity (e.g., lipid II for
nisin,166−168 and phosphatidyl ethanolamine for cinnamycin169,170). Just as medicinal chemists optimize lead structures with synthetic
modifications, Nature has optimized the activity and specificity of
lanthipeptides within the ecological niche of the producer organism
by further tailoring reactions after installation of the characteristic
ring structures. Many of these modifications occur at the N- or C-termini
to increase the stability of the peptides or to change the overall
charge.21,171 Such post-translational modifications in
class I lanthipeptides include the installation of a C-terminal S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-d-Cys (AviCys)
formed via an enethiol intermediate generated by the LanD oxidative
decarboxylase flavoproteins172,173 as found in epidermin
(Figure 5), and the
reduction of a ketone to an alcohol during installation of an N-terminal
2-hydroxypropionate by LanO dehydrogenases,171 as found in epilancin 15x (Figure 5).174 One of the most potent
lantibiotics identified to date is microbisporicin (also known as
NAI-107) produced by Microbispora sp. 107891 (Figure 5), which shows potent
activity against several clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria.175 The chemical structure of this compound shows
two modifications not previously observed in lanthipeptides, specifically,
chlorination on a Trp residue and dihydroxylation of a Pro residue
(Figure 5). Section 2.6 will discuss

(Figure 5). Section 2.6 will discuss
the enzymes involved in these tailoring reactions. The biosynthesis
of nisin is encoded by a transcriptional operon
of 11 genes (Figure 6) encoding the precursor peptide (nisA), three proteins
involved in post-translational modifications (nisB, nisC, and nisP), and an ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) type transporter (nisT), along with
genes encoding transcriptional regulators (nisR and nisK) and immunity proteins (nisI and nisFEG).55 Comparisons with the
gene clusters for subtilin and epidermin, among others, show that
four genes (lanABCT) are common across various biosynthetic
clusters (Figure 6).
Since lanC and lanT have more recently
also been found in clusters of class II lanthipeptides, the presence
of lanB is what uniquely defines class I lanthipeptides.
Notably, the NisA precursor peptide contains 57 residues, while the
product nisin is composed of 34 residues. Hence, the precursor peptide
comprises a 23-residue N-terminal leader sequence that is excised
from the final product and a 34-residue C-terminal core sequence where
the enzymatic modifications are installed (Figure 7). The post-translational installation of
the (β-methyl)lanthionine rings is carried out by two enzymes:
NisB that catalyzes the dehydration of Ser and Thr residues in the
core peptide,176 and the NisC cyclase that
facilitates the intramolecular addition of Cys onto the resultant
dehydro amino acids to generate cyclic NisA with the leader still
attached (mNisA).177 The subtilisin-like
serine protease NisP removes the leader sequence from the post-translationally
modified core178 to yield the bioactive
final product. Two partially orthogonal systems confer immunity against
nisin to the producing organisms: the extracellularly located NisI
lipoprotein that binds and sequesters active nisin,179 and the NisFEG active transporter that is involved in nisin
extrusion.180 The biosynthesis

biosynthetic genes are widely distributed across various bacterial
phyla.36,37 Phylogenetic analysis of the distribution
of the LanC cyclases yields sequences that fall into three distinct
groups: group 1 found in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, and groups
2 and 3 found in Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, respectively.36 The latter two groups are related to one another
and are distinct from the group 1 sequences. Similar analysis of LanB
dehydratases shows that the sequences from Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria
may be derived from Firmicutes, denoting possible differences in the
evolutionary origins of the LanBs versus the LanCs.36 While the phylogenetic distribution of LanBs does not completely
correlate with that of LanCs, enzymes that are from the same biosynthetic
cluster generally group into similar clades. Genome mining studies have demonstrated that class I lanthipeptide

may also be distinguished based on similarities
of their precursor peptides with members for which experimentally
structures have been established. In this classification, the molecules
may be demarcated into the nisin-like, epidermin-like, and Pep5-like
groups.56 This classification extends only
to the lanthipeptide itself and not to the genes in the clusters,
as similarities in the structures of the final products do not necessarily
reflect an equivalent similarity across the biosynthetic enzymes.
For example, although the sequences of the nisin and subtilin precursors
and products are similar, their associated LanC enzymes are only distantly
related.36 The notion of the precursor
sequence possibly directing the final structure is further fortified
by experiments in which fusion of a class II core peptide onto the
class I NisA leader peptide resulted in processing by the nisin biosynthetic
enzymes to yield an antibacterial peptide, which presumably is the
natural product.185 Similarly, expression
of a chimeric peptide consisting of the subtilin leader and a combination
of the nisin and subtilin core peptides with the subtilin biosynthetic
machinery in B. subtilis produced a fully processed
product.186 Likewise, a chimera of the Staphylococcus epidermidis epilancin 15X core peptide and
the NisA leader peptide was processed by the nisin system to afford
a product with ring topology and bioactivity similar to epilancin

via Glutamylation Although
the genes responsible for nisin182 and
subtilin183 production were first identified
in 1992, the mechanistic basis for Ser/Thr dehydration by any class
I LanB was not elucidated for another 20 years. One of the limiting
factors in the characterization of LanB enzymes was the lack of a
suitable heterologous expression and purification system for these
high molecular weight enzymes; for example, NisB is a 117 kDa protein.
In addition, identification of amphipathic α-helices in the
primary sequence and immuno-detection of NisB in vesicles of L. lactis lead to the expectation that NisB may be membrane
associated,182 which also stalled biochemical
efforts. Hence, early experiments were limited in mechanistic explorations,
and focused more on genetic characterization. Plasmid-based overexpression
of NisB in different nisin producing strains increased the efficiency
of dehydration of an engineered NisA variant.187 Additionally, expression of affinity-tagged NisA precursor
peptide in a nisB deletion strain yielded unmodified
peptide, while expression in a nisC deletion strain
yielded a product that had undergone dehydration but was not cyclized.188,189 These data established that NisB carries out the dehydration on
the NisA precursor peptide, which is cyclized by NisC. Although
the genes responsible for nisin182 and
subtilin183 production were first identified
in 1992, the mechanistic basis for Ser/Thr dehydration by any class
I LanB was not elucidated for another 20 years. One of the limiting
factors in the characterization of LanB enzymes was the lack of a
suitable heterologous expression and purification system for these
high molecular weight enzymes; for example, NisB is a 117 kDa protein.
In addition, identification of amphipathic α-helices in the
primary sequence and immuno-detection of NisB in vesicles of L. lactis lead to the expectation that NisB may be membrane
associated,182 which also stalled biochemical
efforts. Hence, early experiments were limited in mechanistic explorations,

early 2000s, coexpression of SpaB from B. subtilis ATCC 6633 (the subtilin producer) with the GroESL chaperones facilitated
purification of the enzyme in milligram quantities.190 However, multiple attempts to reconstitute in vitro activity
using the purified protein were unsuccessful. Nearly a decade later,
two different methodologies allowed for the production of soluble
NisB protein, facilitating functional analysis. First, homologous
expression of C-terminally polyhistidine tagged NisB in L.
lactis yielded soluble protein that could be purified from
the cytosol using affinity chromatography, and showed no propensity
for aggregation even after prolonged storage.191 Size-exclusion chromatography, combined with multiangle
static light scattering analyses, demonstrated that purified NisB
behaved as a homogeneous species with a mass consistent with that
of a protein dimer. Surface plasmon resonance experiments documented
that purified NisB interacted with the substrate precursor peptide,
as well as with the dehydrated NisA with affinities in the micromolar
range. In a second approach, coexpression of NisB along with the NisC
cyclase and the NisA precursor peptide in Escherichia coli enabled the production of authentic nisin.92 While the dehydratase produced in E. coli using
this coexpression strategy was not yet purified, the enzyme had to
be functional as the NisA precursor was dehydrated and cyclized in

affinity-tagged
NisB was coexpressed with NisA in E. coli, facilitating
purification of the enzyme from the soluble fraction. Although in
vitro activity could not be demonstrated using purified components,
addition of crude E. coli cell extract, along with
ATP, MgCl2, and glutamate (the most abundant E.
coli metabolite) to reactions of NisB generated up to nine
dehydrations on the NisA precursor peptide.192 These studies established the first in vitro biochemically tractable
system that allowed monitoring of LanB dehydratase activity, facilitating
functional analysis of site-specific LanB variants, and access to
possible intermediates in the modification pathway. Ala-scanning mutational
analysis was used to identify the role of various polar residues in
NisB that are conserved among most LanB enzymes, to assess if any
of these residues play a role in the chemistry of dehydration. A group
of Ala variants that largely clustered to the N-terminus of NisB (Arg14,
Arg83, Arg87, Thr89, Asp121, Asp299, and Arg464) were inactive, suggesting
their importance for dehydratase activity. Intriguingly, while Ala
variants at residues located at the C-terminus of NisB (Arg786, Arg826,
and His961) did not produce a dehydrated product, these variants generated
NisA modified by multiple adducts of +129 Da as observed by mass spectrometry.192 The mass shift is consistent with the addition
of multiple glutamate residues on the NisA precursor peptide. Polyglutamylation
is a post-translational modification in which a free Glu is added
via its amino group onto the γ-carboxylate of Glu residues forming
an isopeptide bond. Then the added Glu serves as a site for another
glutamylation, ultimately leading to polyglutamylation. This modification
has previously been observed and extensively studied in eukaryotic
tubulin.193 Based on the heterologous expression data, recombinant,

NisA precursor with wild-type NisB dehydratase
resulted in elimination of the glutamate to yield a dehydrated product
(Figure 8), and this
elimination reaction did not require ATP, MgCl2, or E. coli cell extract.192 Thus,
glutamylation could not be on Glu residues but had to be on Ser/Thr
residues. These data also demonstrated that the glutamylated NisA
is an intermediate in the dehydration pathway, where esterification
via the Oγ of Ser/Thr would presumably activate the side chain
hydroxyl for subsequent β-elimination. Incubation of glutamylated
NisA with Ala variants at the N-terminus of NisB also resulted in
glutamate elimination. Collectively, these data suggest that the N-terminal
portion of NisB harbors the glutamylation activity, and the glutamate
elimination activity resides largely within the C-terminal portion
of the polypeptide. However, prior activation of Glu, via either the
α- or the side-chain carboxylate, would be required to catalyze
glutamate addition onto the side chain Ser/Thr of the precursor substrate,
but the NisB dehydratase did not demonstrate any Glu activation activity. Incubation of glutamylated

of activated Glu, E. coli extract was fractionated
into high and low molecular weight pools,
with activity only present in the high molecular weight fractions.194 Further separation of components using anion
exchange chromatography localized the bioactive component to a fraction
pool that absorbed strongly at 260 nm and was sensitive to treatment
with RNase.194 These data supported glutamyl-tRNAGlu as the source of activated Glu that is necessary for NisB
activity. A reconstitution experiment with purified NisB and NisA,
along with glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) and tRNAGlu illustrated that the latter two are the constituents of E. coli extract that are necessary and sufficient for NisB
activity.194 Thus, NisB does not catalyze
aminoacylation of tRNA but rather utilizes the glutamyl-tRNAGlu that is available from the cellular pool. These data are consistent
with a mechanistic model in which LanB dehydratases activate the side
chain hydroxyls of Ser/Thr through the addition of a Glu residue derived
from glutamyl-tRNAGlu, and subsequently abstract the α
proton of the modified Ser/Thr to facilitate β-elimination to
yield the dehydro amino acid (Figure 8). The use of negatively charged glutamyl-tRNAGlu as a cosubstrate may explain the observation that Ser/Thr
residues flanked by hydrophobic residues are better substrates for
dehydration than those flanked by polar and especially negatively
charged residues.74,79 In order to elucidate the source

the E. coli glutamyl-tRNAGlu as a source
of activated Glu, the LanB from the NAI-107
producing organism Microbispora sp. 107891, MibB,
could not do so efficiently.196 Reconstitution
of activity for MibB required the addition of the charged cognate
CUC anticodon tRNAGlu from the producing organism.196 A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of Microbispora sp. 107891 tRNAGlu with that of E. coli tRNAGlu revealed differences in the acceptor
stem. A G73A single mutation and G73A/C72U double mutation were introduced
in the E. coli tRNAGlu acceptor stem to
reflect the sequence found in Microbispora sp. 107891
tRNAGlu. Notably, reactions using the G73A variant of E. coli tRNAGlu produced up to three dehydrations
in the MibA precursor peptide, whereas the G73A/C72U double variant
produced up to six dehydrations on the precursor.196 Hence, the tRNA acceptor stem likely serves as a major

LanB dehydratases were
afforded with the crystal structure of Microbispora sp. 107891 MibB196 and of L.
lactis NisB in complex with the NisA precursor peptide.194 Both studies revealed that the LanB enzymes
have a didomain architecture consisting of an ∼800 residue
N-terminal domain and an ∼350 residue C-terminal domain (Figure 9A). The structures
do not show resemblance to any other proteins in the Protein Data
Bank,197 and therefore constitute a new
fold. Although crystallization of the NisB-NisA complex utilized the
entire precursor peptide, and mass spectrometric analysis of dissolved
crystals confirmed the integrity of the dehydrated precursor, convincing
electron density could only be observed for Lys−20 through
Lys−9 of the leader peptide (see Figure 7 for leader peptide numbering scheme), indicating

CCA terminus in the direct vicinity of residues necessary for glutamylation.194 The NisB structure revealed that residues that
were identified via Ala-scanning mutational analysis as important
for glutamylation are distributed within a 10 Å radius in the
N-terminal domain, and those important for β-elimination are
closely distributed within the C-terminal domain (Figure 10).192,194 Analysis of NisB variants generated in a nisin producing strain
identified Tyr80 of NisB as a residue that is critical for dehydratase
activity, and the Y80F variant could bind the NisA precursor but did
not modify the substrate in vivo.198 One
possible role for Tyr80 is as a shuttle for glutamate from glutamyl-tRNAGlu to the NisA substrate. The crystal structure of the MibB
dehydratase shows an overall conservation of most structural features
present in NisB,196 although some local
movements near the leader peptide-binding site are evident (see section 2.5). Mapping of electrostatic potentials

side chain
via its α-carboxylate was provided by a study on the nonlanthipeptide
goadsporin. The structure of this RiPP features several dehydro amino
acids,199 and its biosynthetic gene cluster
contains two open reading frames that would be consistent with one
gene that corresponds to a Glu-tRNA dependent glutamylation enzyme
and one that corresponds to a Glu elimination enzyme.200 Disruption of the latter in the producing organism
resulted in buildup of intermediates that were characterized by NMR
spectroscopy.195 These studies unambiguously
showed attachment of Glu via its α-carboxylate to the Ser side
chain. Similar “split” LanB systems are also present
in the biosynthetic gene clusters of thiopeptides (see review by Burkhart
et al. in this issue),201 another class
of RiPPs, and they have been shown to also utilize Glu-tRNA for dehydration
of Ser/Thr in their substrate peptides.202,203 Split LanB enzymes are also found in some lanthipeptide biosynthetic
gene clusters35 including one in Chitinophaga pinensis DSM 28390. This cluster produces the
pinensins (Figure 5), the first antifungal lantibiotics and the first characterized
lanthipeptides from Bacteroidetes.5 With
now four LanB and LanB-like enzymes investigated from different genera,194−196,202 the use of Glu-tRNA appears
to be a general requirement. These findings also explained a previous
report on the in vitro biosynthesis of nisin by expression of nisA, nisB, and nisC in
a cell-free translation system.204 This
experimental setup contained tRNAs, tRNA transferases, and all amino
acids, and hence nisin biosynthesis was observed. We also note that
esterification of Ser/Thr, instead of phosphorylation (see sections 4.2 and 5.2), was already suggested back in 1991 as a potential
activation mechanism for dehydration.205 Why LanBs use Glu-tRNA and not another amino acyl-tRNA is currently
not understood. For an overview of the use of aminoacylated tRNA in
natural product biosynthesis, see the review by Gondry and co-workers

phylogenic distribution of LanB enzymes, a sequence
similarity network was constructed for this review with the Enzyme
Function Initiative-Enzyme Similarity Tool (EFI-EST)207 utilizing all members of the N-terminal Lantibiotic Dehydratase
family (Pfam 04738) from the UniProtKB database (version 2016_06; Figure 11). After constructing
the network, all sequences that did not contain a C-terminal Lantibiotic
Dehydratase family domain (Pfam 14028) were removed, leaving only
complete LanB proteins containing both the N-terminal glutamylation
and C-terminal elimination domains (i.e., split LanBs and small LanBs194 were removed). The relative similarity between
individual LanBs was assessed in Cytoscape208 at an alignment score threshold of 120 (∼30% sequence identity).
Actinobacteria constitute the majority of the LanB sequences found
in the UniProtKB database and appear to be distributed into two major
groups. While the larger cluster is isolated from the clusters of
other phyla, the smaller cluster from Actinobacteria appears to be
related to LanBs found in Firmicutes. As for the Actinobacteria, LanBs
from Bacteroidetes are split into two major clusters. The larger of
these two is closely linked to LanBs from Proteobacteria, suggesting
a close lineage. Previous phylogenetic analysis of the LanC cyclase
enzymes showed that Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria LanCs are closely
related and are distinct from LanCs from Actinobacteria and Firmicutes.36 To determine the

ring is completed with the intramolecular attack of a Cys thiolate
onto the dehydro amino acid. Conjugate addition of nucleophiles to
dehydro amino acids is well characterized and, in principle, formation
of lanthionine rings could occur spontaneously at basic pH.209−211 However, attempts to recapitulate the correct ring topology of nisin
synthetically yielded a mixture of products. For example, an attempt
to form the AB ring system of nisin by biomimetic cyclization of a
synthetic model produced multiple products.212 These products were presumed to result from the faster cyclization
rate for lanthionines compared to methyllanthionines under nonenzymatic
conditions.213 Consequently, enzymatic

of a LanC cyclase was carried out via genetic studies of Pep5 biosynthesis,
wherein deletion of the C-terminal 231 residues of PepC from a biosynthetic
plasmid in the Staphylococcus epidermidis 5 producing
strain diminished formation of lanthionine rings.214 Isolation of intermediates from this strain demonstrated
that the Ser/Thr residues in the precursor peptide had undergone modification
but in most cases the Cys residues were intact. Studies of mutant
strains of S. epidermidis Tü3298 that do not
produce epidermin revealed an intact biosynthetic pathway but with
mutations in the epiC gene, as plasmid complementation
with wild-type epiC restored lanthipeptide production.215 These data suggested that formation of the
thioether linkages is not spontaneous, and that the LanC cyclase is
required for the site-specific addition of Cys onto the dehydro amino
acid to achieve the proper ring topology. Initial characterization of the function

could be readily purified after overexpression
in an E. coli heterologous system, as first demonstrated
for EpiC from the epidermin cluster.216 However, in vitro characterization of LanC activity initially proved
challenging due to the lack of suitable quantities of the dehydrated
precursor substrate and the lack of a means to detect the cyclization
reaction, as there is no change in mass of the precursor peptide upon
thioether formation. Interestingly, sequencing of the nonproducer
mutants of S. epidermidis Tü3298 described
above identified G131E or G245E mutations in EpiC (note that numbering
is adjusted from ref (216) to correspond with the complete gene), and each of these residues
are in motifs conserved throughout LanCs and G245 is in the vicinity
of the predicted catalytic acid (His248) in the primary sequence.
The authors also noted that two Cys residues (Cys313 and Cys360 in
EpiC) are also conserved among LanCs,216 suggesting that these Cys may play a role in catalysis. In 2002,
analysis of affinity tagged NisA precursor expressed in mutant strains
of L. lactis that lacked NisC showed that the peptide
had undergone dehydration but not cyclization, confirming a role for
LanC enzymes in the cyclization reaction.188 The LanC cyclases

from a heterologous E. coli expression system indicated
that both enzymes contain stoichiometric amounts of zinc.217 Based on a functional role for zinc in maintaining
the reactivity of thiols at neutral pH in other alkylating enzymes,218,219 the zinc in LanC was proposed to function as a Lewis acid to lower
the pKa of the Sγ of Cys, enabling
the thiolate to participate in conjugate addition to Dha or Dhb residues.217 The in vitro reconstitution of NisC activity
was finally achieved using dehydrated NisA purified from a L. lactis strain that encoded the precursor peptide, dehydratase,
and transporter but lacked the gene for the cyclase.177 Thioether formation was monitored by mass spectral analysis
of the dehydrated NisA that was treated with a thiol-selective modification
agent. In the event, the dehydrated peptide was modified five times
indicating the presence of five free thiols, whereas peptide that
was treated with NisC did not show any mass shift, consistent with
a sample devoid of any free Cys as a result of five cyclizations.
Proteolytic removal of the leader peptide from the NisC-treated precursor
yielded a product that was bioactive against a nisin indicator strain,
suggesting that NisC installed the correct ring topology of nisin.177 Chemical analysis of two LanC enzymes (NisC and SpaC) purified

an α,α-toroidal
fold containing a single zinc ion at the center of the toroid (Figure 12A). Enzyme residues
Cys284, Cys330, and His331 coordinate the zinc ion (Figure 12B),177 and these residues are very close in structure to the Gly residue
that corresponds to Gly245 in EpiC that was altered to Glu in a nonepidermin-producing
strain of S. epidermidis Tü3298. The structure
also reveals a small extension adjacent to the zinc ion, which resemble
mammalian SH2 domains220 and may analogously
serve to bind the peptide substrate. However, there is currently no
evidence for a functional role of this SH2-like extension. More recently,
mammalian homologues of LanC proteins, termed LanCL (for “LanC-like”)
have been identified and characterized to similarly contain an active

also reveals a small extension adjacent to the zinc ion, which resemble
mammalian SH2 domains220 and may analogously
serve to bind the peptide substrate. However, there is currently no
evidence for a functional role of this SH2-like extension. More recently,
mammalian homologues of LanC proteins, termed LanCL (for “LanC-like”)
have been identified and characterized to similarly contain an active
site zinc (Figure 12C).221 Figure 12(A) Overall structure of the NisC cyclase

at residues in the vicinity
of the zinc ion, which are conserved between NisC and the subtilin
cyclase SpaC, in order to probe their importance in catalysis (Figure 12B). Activity for
SpaC was measured by detecting production of subtilin in vivo222 while the activity of NisC variants were monitored
by the bioactivity of products formed in vitro in reactions using
purified dehydrated NisA.223 Mutation of
the zinc-ligands Cys284, Cys330, or His331 in NisC, or the equivalent

and mutational data provide a plausible mechanistic
framework for LanC catalysis (Figure 13). Coordination of the Cys residue in the precursor
peptide by the catalytically requisite zinc ion lowers the pKa to facilitate deprotonation, which may or
may not require a general base. For instance, in protein farnesyltransferase,
the pKa of a Cys residue in the peptide
substrate is lowered from 8.3 to 6.4 upon binding to the zinc in the
enzyme active site.224 A role of the zinc
ion in thiol activation, rather than activation of the carbonyl group
in the dehydro amino acid electrophile, is supported by both the common
use of Zn2+ for thiol activation in other proteins218,219,225 and the observation of a direct
interaction between the sulfur of Cys in glutathione (GSH) and the
zinc ion in the mammalian protein LanCL1 (Figure 12C). Indeed, activation of thiols for nucleophilic
attack by zinc coordination is well supported by model studies with
small molecule metal complexes.226−237 The structural

containing
the dehydrated residue targeted for cyclization would be directed
back toward the active site, perhaps through the SH2-like extension,
where the thiolate would attack the β-carbon of the dehydro
amino acid to generate an enolate. Subsequent protonation provides
the D-configuration at the α-carbon via a net anti addition
to account for the stereochemistry of MeLan in nisin (Figure 13). The shallow groove formed
at the center of the α-toroid may facilitate formation of thioether
linkages of different sizes (4–7 amino acids in nisin, Figure 7). The identity of
residues that may deprotonate the thiol and/or protonate the enolate
has not been equivocally established. Mutation of His212 or its hydrogen-bonding
partner Asp141 in NisC abolished activity but the role of these residues
is unclear from the mutational analysis.223 More recent studies have shown that cyclization is reversible. In
particular, the class I cyclase NisC and the class II lanthipeptide
synthetase HalM2 can also catalyze ring opening (i.e., a retro-conjugate
addition) following abstraction of the α proton of the (methyl)lanthionine.238 Mutation of His791 in HalM2 (equivalent to
His212 in NisC) abolished this proton abstraction suggesting that
this residue acts as the base in the retro-conjugate addition. In
turn, this suggests that His212 in NisC is the acid that protonates
the enolate during ring formation. Mutations of two other conserved
amino acids in the active site, Y285F or R280A in NisC223 did not abolish in vitro cyclase activity,
suggesting they are not critical for catalysis. A more drastic mutation
of the corresponding Tyr in SpaC (Y304A) did result in loss of subtilin
production in vivo,222 with similar results
observed for the NisC-Y285A mutant.223 Upon ligation of the Cys thiol, the segment of the peptide

the formation of well-defined ring patterns with widely differing
ring sizes and sequences in just a single active site. The dehydrated
NisA intermediate shown in Figure 7 contains eight dehydro amino acids and five Cys residues.
As noted previously,150 the number of products
differing in ring topology that can be generated by a completely nonselective
cyclization process would be 6720, with the number going to at least
8.6 × 105 if stereochemistry is included. Yet, NisC
makes a single product. As discussed in the next section, one means
by which the enzyme may simplify the task is to alternate dehydration
and cyclization processes such that the number of dehydro amino acids
that each Cys has to differentiate is smaller. Another possibility
is that the substrate sequence has an inherent preference for certain
ring topologies. This hypothesis is especially supported from data
on class II lanthipeptides discussed in section 4.3.3, but some class I systems also provide
support. For instance, ericin A and S are made by one set of class
I biosynthetic enzymes in Bacillus subtilis A1/3.239 The D ring of ericin S is linked to the E ring
similar to the topology found in subtilin whereas the D ring of ericin
A is intertwined with the C ring similar to the structure found in
microbisporicin (Figure 14). Thus, it appears that depending on the sequence of its
substrate, EriC can form products with different topologies. At present, it is not understood how the cyclization enzymes control

of NisC it appears that rings are installed before dehydration has
finished such that certain positions become protected from access

a position directly C-terminal to the E-ring in mNisA that is usually
not dehydrated by NisB (i.e., Ser29 in the NisA precursor, see Figure 7).244 These results suggest that E-ring formation prevents dehydration
of Ser29 by NisB. The observation that cyclization is interspersed
with dehydration is consistent with, but does not prove, a channeling
model in which the product from one enzyme is channeled to the next
enzyme without dissociation, possibly through a multienzyme complex
of NisB and NisC. As discussed in more detail in section 4.4, an alternative to channeling

as well as on the directionality of processing, were elucidated through
in vitro studies of the biosynthesis of NAI-107.196 Processing of the MibA precursor peptide in the presence
of only the MibB dehydratase resulted in up to 7 dehydrations. Mass
spectral analysis identified the expected dehydrated intermediates,
along with masses that corresponded to monoglutamylated MibA, which
were formed only after the accumulation of 5-fold dehydrated MibA.196 Notably, upon addition of the MibC cyclase
to the reaction, the monoglutamylated intermediates were no longer
detected. These observations suggest that glutamate elimination is
slower from late stage intermediates than for early intermediates.
Use of an inactive MibC mutant did not prevent the formation of glutamylated
intermediates, and hence the elimination of these late stage intermediates
is facilitated by thioether formation. This observation is consistent
with the substrate alternating between modification in the dehydratase
and cyclase active sites, which may be facilitated by a multicomplex
assembly and, as described above for NisA, may involve channeling
or conformational sampling. Surprisingly, pattern-matching algorithmic
analysis of MibA processing by MibB suggested that dehydration does
not occur with an N- to C-terminal directionality, as observed for
nisin, but occurs in a nonlinear fashion.196 This nondirectional order of processing has also been observed for
class II246 and class III247 lanthipeptide biosynthetic systems. Hence, there are significant
differences between individual lanthipeptide biosynthetic pathways,
with some having tightly coupled dehydration and cyclization processes
(e.g., NAI-107) and others where such tight coupling is not required
for producing the correct final products (e.g., nisin). Further details on

in the Introduction, the sequences
of lanthipeptide precursor peptides may be demarcated into an N-terminal
leader sequence and a C-terminal core sequence (Figure 3). Post-translational modifications are installed
on residues located in the core sequence, after which the leader sequence
is removed to afford the final natural product. The initial proposal
that the leader peptide may be involved in the biosynthetic process
was based on the observation that the leader sequence of the nisin
precursor peptide shares similar features with those of subtilin,
epidermin, and Pep5.39 Conceptually, the
leader sequence may facilitate biosynthesis by interacting with processing
enzymes, by assisting in the transport of the processed peptide product,
and/or by contributing to immunity within the producing organism.248 Experiments suggest that the leader sequence
of the fully modified NisA precursor does not directly interact with
the modified core peptide, either in solution or in lipid micelles,249 thus providing no evidence for a direct role
of the leader in the chemical transformations in the core peptide. As discussed

about 25 residues in length (e.g., 23 for the nisin leader peptide)
and generally contain acidic amino acids. Ala-scanning mutational
analysis of the leader sequence in the NisA precursor, carried out
using a plasmid-encoded gene in a nisin producing strain, identified
a four-residue motif, Phe−18/Asn−17/Leu−16/Asp−15
(hereafter FNLD, Figure 7), as critical for nisin production and secretion.248,250,251 Co-immunoprecipitation experiments252 and surface plasmon resonance analysis of the
interaction of variants of NisA191 demonstrated
the importance of the FNLD sequence for the direct interaction between
the NisB dehydratase and the NisA precursor. Isothermal titration
calorimetric studies demonstrated that the NisC cyclase also binds
to the NisA precursor with a Kd of 2.0
μM, regardless of whether the core is unmodified or processed,
and to the leader sequence with a Kd of
3.8 μM.253 Notably, the FNLD sequence
in the NisA precursor that is critical for engaging the NisB dehydratase
is also essential for binding to NisC, and Ala mutations at either
Phe−18 or Leu−16 completely abolished the interaction.
Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that other regions of the
leader may also be necessary for engaging the NisC cyclase.254 Although the leader peptide is sufficient for
interactions with the dehydratase and the cyclase individually, the
formation of a multienzyme complex that includes NisB and NisC appears
to require both the leader and the core sequence, but not necessarily
the modified residues.255,256 Interestingly, in
vivo NisB can partially dehydrate the NisA core peptide without the
leader peptide and more efficiently when the leader peptide is coexpressed

for the interaction between the nisin leader
peptide and the dehydratase was elucidated by the cocrystal structure
of the NisB-NisA complex.194 Electron density
could only be observed for residues Lys−9 through Lys−20
of the leader peptide (Figure 15A), which includes the FNLD sequence (Figure 7). Despite expectations based
on structure prediction tools that the leader sequence would bind
to the dehydratase as an amphipathic α-helix,257 the structural data revealed that the leader forms a β-strand
against a small winged helix-turn-helix motif located at the juncture
of the glutamylation domain and the glutamate elimination domain.194 A similar winged helix-turn-helix motif is
also observed in the structure of unrelated RiPP biosynthetic enzymes,
such as the cyanobactin heterocyclases,258,259 PqqD, a peptide-binding protein from the pyrroloquinoline quinone
biosynthetic pathway,260,261 and PaaA involved in pantocin
biosynthesis.262 Bioinformatic analysis
and binding studies established that domains of similar architecture
are responsible for leader peptide recognition in a wide array of
RiPP biosynthetic systems, including lasso peptides and thiopeptides.
The domain was therefore termed the RiPP Recognition Element (RRE).263 Interaction between the domain and the leader
peptide has been affirmed in the cocrystal structure of the cyanobactin
heterocyclase LynD in complex with the leader peptide of its substrate
(Figure 15B),259 and is also supported by mutagenesis studies
in a radical epimerase involved in proteusin biosynthesis,264 and binding studies on sactipeptide synthetases.265 Thus, leader peptide binding by the winged

The black arrow illustrates the inward tilt of an ampipathic helix
in MibB relative to its counterpart in NisB that interacts with the

is
mediated largely through hydrophobic packing interactions. Within
the critical FNLD sequence of NisA, Phe−18 is inserted into
a hydrophobic pocket in NisB composed of residues Val176, Val198,
Tyr202, Leu209, and Tyr213. Likewise, Leu−16 from this motif
is bound in a hydrophobic pocket composed of Ile171, Tyr213, and Leu217.194 Lastly, Asp−15 of the motif is within
hydrogen-bonding distance to Arg154 of NisB (Figure 15A). Similar hydrophobic packing interactions
are observed in the engagement of the cyanobactin heterocyclase with
its cognate leader peptide,259 consistent
with prior mutational data that implicated several aliphatic residues
in the leader peptide as critical for interactions with this modification

may have a different recognition motif consisting of the EDLF sequence.266 The interaction between NisB and the leader sequence of NisA

half of the leader
peptide. The C-terminal half does not appear to be important for specific
interactions with NisB as it is not observed in the NisA-NisB cocrystal
structure. However, replacing leader peptide residues four-at-a-time
with Ala4 did result in less efficient substrates and in
some cases to lower amounts of NisB in pull-down experiments.254 Conversely, the amino acids at residues −13
to −8 of the leader peptide could be replaced by six His residues
without losing NisB activity.251 Hence,
although there may be some interactions with the surface of NisB,
generally speaking the C-terminal part of the leader peptide appears
to be a spacer251 that is required to bridge
the distance of the leader peptide binding site and the glutamylation
active site that is visualized by the crystal structure.194 Such a spacer region seems less important for
the glutamate elimination activity since a glutamylated core peptide
lacking the leader peptide was a substrate for NisB, resulting in
glutamate elimination.194 As long as a
minimal distance between the leader peptide binding site and the glutamylation
active site is satisfied, dehydration can occur, even when the distance
is increased significantly as shown by studies where half of a second
core peptide fused at the end of NisA was modified by NisB.79 Similarly, Ser/Thr that are sufficiently spaced
from the FNLD motif do not need to be in register with the motif since
the intervening distance can be changed without losing the ability
of NisB to perform the correct dehydrations.267 Similar findings have also been reported for the class I lanthipeptide
mutacin 1140,268 as well as for class II

from Microbispora sp. 107891 has been determined
in the absence of the leader peptide.
A comparison of the MibB structure with that of the NisB-NisA complex
shows differences in domain orientations near the winged helix-turn-helix
motif, which may reflect conformational changes that accompany binding
of the leader sequence (Figure 15C). In the NisB-NisA cocrystal structure, portions
of the leader peptide bind to a hydrophobic region containing several
residues from an amphipathic helix, while in the MibB structure the
equivalent helix is tilted inward such that the hydrophobic residues
are oriented toward the interior of the protein (Figure 15C). This shift results in
compensatory movements of the elimination domain to form a more compact
overall structure. However, the lack of a MibB-MibA cocrystal structure
precludes any conclusion at present regarding the importance of these
conformational movements. The structure of the MibB dehydratase

motif, which may reflect conformational changes that accompany binding
of the leader sequence (Figure 15C). In the NisB-NisA cocrystal structure, portions
of the leader peptide bind to a hydrophobic region containing several
residues from an amphipathic helix, while in the MibB structure the
equivalent helix is tilted inward such that the hydrophobic residues
are oriented toward the interior of the protein (Figure 15C). This shift results in
compensatory movements of the elimination domain to form a more compact
overall structure. However, the lack of a MibB-MibA cocrystal structure
precludes any conclusion at present regarding the importance of these
conformational movements. The structure of the MibB dehydratase
from Microbispora sp. 107891 has been determined
in the absence of the leader peptide.

subset of class I lanthipeptides, including epilancin 15X,171 epicidin 280,272 and epilancin K7 (Figure 5 and 16A),273 are characterized by the presence of a lactyl group (Lac) on the
N-terminus of the processed product. The corresponding precursor peptides
all contain a Ser residue immediately following the leader sequence,
which is converted to Dha by the cognate LanB dehydratase. Upon removal
of the leader peptide, the resultant N-terminal Dha1 presumably spontaneously
tautomerizes to an unstable imine, which then undergoes nonenzymatic
hydrolysis to generate a 2-oxopropionyl (pyruvyl) moiety, as has been
observed in the structure of lactocin S (see section 4.6.1)274,275 and the pinensins (Figure 5).5 Likewise, leader excision,

ElxO from the epilancin 15X biosynthetic cluster in Staphylococcus
epidermidis 15X154 facilitated reconstitution of enzymatic
activity.171 Although the physiological
substrate (dehydroepilancin 15X) could not be accessed, recombinant
ElxO catalyzed the reduction of a synthetic analog containing an N-terminal
pyruvyl group (Pyr) followed by five residues resembling the N-terminus
of the ElxA core peptide (Pyr-AAIVK; Figure 5). Reduction of this synthetic substrate
to Lac required an NADPH cofactor, and LC-MS analysis using synthetic
standards assigned the stereochemical configuration of Lac as R.171 Characterization of the
substrate scope of ElxO, using a library of peptides, demonstrated
the enzyme as generally tolerant of amino acids that are appended
to the N-terminal Pyr, but some trends in scope were observed.278 First, the kcat/Km values increased with substrate length,
as peptides with 1–3 residues were generally poor substrates
and a 13-residue peptide had a higher kcat/Km compared to a peptide of 5 residues.
Furthermore, peptides with a longer N-terminal oxobutyryl modification
were accepted as substrates, but those with a shorter glyoxyl group
were not.278 As ElxO tolerates amino acid
substitutions at residues following Pyr, the enzyme may have potential
as a biotechnological tool for the installation of N-terminal alcohols
on other lanthipeptides. For instance, incubation of ElxO with lactocin

with NADP(H) affirmed
its classification as a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase
(SDR) family of oxidoreductases.278 As
with other members of the SDR family, the architecture of ElxO is
built around a Rossmann-fold dinucleotide-binding motif (Figure 17A). The NADP(H)
cofactor binds in an extended conformation. Other SDR enzymes utilize
a catalytic Tyr that acts as both a general acid and base, flanked
by an adjacent Lys that lowers the pKa of the Tyr, and a Ser that polarizes the substrate carbonyl.279 The active site of ElxO indicates that Ser139,
Tyr153, and Lys157 could function in these roles (Figure 17B), and mutations of any of
these residues resulted in a strong reduction of the reaction rate,
reflecting their importance in catalysis. In the proposed catalytic
mechanism, Tyr153 and Ser139 activate the N-terminal carbonyl of the
substrate through hydrogen bonding, creating an environment that facilitates
hydride transfer from NADPH to the Si-face of the
carbonyl to produce the R-Lac product. A long groove

Oxidative Decarboxylation at the C-Terminus Oxidative Decarboxylation at the C-Terminus Oxidative Decarboxylation at the C-Terminus Oxidative Decarboxylation at the C-Terminus Several lanthipeptides, including epidermin, gallidermin, NAI-107,
and mutacin 1140 contain the amino acid S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-d-cysteine (AviCys) at their C-termini
(Figures 5 and 16B). This modification was first identified through
structural elucidation of epidermin from S. epidermidis Tü3298,173 and subsequent heterologous
expression of the epiD gene from the corresponding
biosynthetic cluster produced a yellow flavoprotein that was presumed
to function in AviCys formation.172 Reconstitution
studies of EpiD, using either the precursor peptide EpiA283 or a synthetic peptide corresponding to the
epidermin core,284 indicated a loss of
46 Da from the substrate corresponding to the loss of CO2 and two H atoms. These studies confirmed that EpiD carries out oxidative
decarboxylation of the C-terminal Cys, to produce a (Z)-enethiol product. As the mechanism of LanD enzymes has been previously

decarboxylation of the C-terminal Cys, to produce a (Z)-enethiol product. As the mechanism of LanD enzymes has been previously
reviewed,44 it will only briefly be discussed. Several lanthipeptides, including epidermin, gallidermin, NAI-107,
and mutacin 1140 contain the amino acid S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-d-cysteine (AviCys) at their C-termini
(Figures 5 and 16B). This modification was first identified through
structural elucidation of epidermin from S. epidermidis Tü3298,173 and subsequent heterologous
expression of the epiD gene from the corresponding
biosynthetic cluster produced a yellow flavoprotein that was presumed
to function in AviCys formation.172 Reconstitution

that the decarboxylation reaction does not require the leader sequence,285 and studies using several truncated variants
of the epidermin core sequence localized the terminal four residues
of EpiA (SYCC) as the minimal substrate for EpiD.284 Modifications to the peptide C-terminus, such as ethylation,
prevented oxidative decarboxylation, indicating that a free carboxy
terminus is required.284 Mutational analysis
of EpiD,286 along with the cocrystal structure
with a peptide substrate (Figure 18),287 provides the basis
for a plausible mechanism for AviCys installation. The flavin cofactor
(FMN in EpiD) first oxidizes the terminal Cys to a thioaldehyde, followed
by spontaneous decarboxylation to form the thioenolate.287,288 Attack of this enethiol onto the Dha residue, possibly catalyzed
by the EpiC cyclase, would yield the AviCys product. EpiD as well
as the homologous enzymes MrsD and MibD involved in mersacidin and
NAI-107 biosynthesis,289−291 respectively, have sequence homology with
enzymes that carry out two reactions during the biosynthesis of 4′-phosphopantetheine
in coenzyme A biosynthesis. These latter enzymes first catalyze flavin-dependent
oxidative decarboxylation of a Cys similarly to the LanD proteins,
and subsequently reduce the resulting aminoethenethiol group to the
corresponding 2-mercaptoethylamine. This class of proteins, including
LanD, has been named the homo-oligomeric flavin-containing Cys decarboxylase

observed in two
other classes of RiPP natural products, namely linaridins297,298 and thioviridamides.299 Although linaridins

antibacterial activity
against many Gram-positive pathogens175 and has demonstrated efficacy in experimental models of infection.16 The compound consists of a complex of related
molecules produced by Microbispora sp. 107891, and
these all contain two modifications not previously reported in lanthipeptides,
namely halogenation on Trp and (di)hydroxylation on Pro (Figure 5).175 The two predominant congeners differ in the presence of
one or two hydroxyl groups on Pro14 of the final product. The biosynthetic
gene cluster of microbisporicin encodes the expected cadre of class

the MibC cyclase, and the MibT transporter in addition to the substrate
MibA.301 The cluster also contains additional
genes that are presumed to install the two novel modifications, based
on sequence similarities with enzymes that catalyze similar reactions.
Specifically, the MibH and MibS proteins are similar to flavin-dependent
halogenases and their corresponding flavin reductases that together
catalyze halogenation in an FADH2-dependent manner.302 Recent in vitro studies confirmed that MibH
catalyzes the chlorination at Trp4 of MibA and that MibS provides
reduced FAD.291 MibH is the first halogenase
that acts on Trp embedded in a peptide sequence as all prior Trp halogenases
acted either on free tryptophan or tryptophan (or its analogs) tethered
to coenzyme A or a carrier protein.302 The
crystal structure of MibH was determined, revealing a much larger
binding cavity than previously characterized Trp halogenases.291 This finding explains the very high substrate
specificity of MibH, which requires preinstallation of the thioether
rings in the substrate MibA for chlorination activity. Interestingly,
inclusion of KBr in the production medium of the NAI-107 producer
yielded bromination (rather than chlorination) on Trp4 of the mature
lanthipeptide, suggesting some flexibility in the halogenase.303 The MibO polypeptide shows similarities to

produce natural products that are bioactive against other closely
related strains must protect themselves against toxicity from the
final product. As most lanthipeptides are not active until removal
of the leader sequence,248,304 coupling of leader
excision to active transport provides a level of innate defense. Two
other strategies have been adopted by strains that produce class I
lanthipeptides to afford immunity, and these include active transport
to avert unwanted build-up and sequestering of the mature lanthipeptide
in the extracellular environment. Lipid II is the target of many lanthipeptides
including nisin,166,167 mersacidin,305 lacticin 481/nukacin ISK-1,94,306 and many
two-component lantibiotics307−309 (and their structural analogs).
Lipid II is present both on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and,
after translocation, on the extracellular side. Thus, immunity needs
to be provided both intracellularly and extracellularly. Lanthipeptide
efflux from producing organisms is mediated by the LanFEG complex,
an integral membrane ABC type transport system. Disruption of either nisE and/or nisF in L. lactis does not affect the ability to produce nisin but results in an increase
in susceptibility, confirming their role in immunity.310,311 However, the lanFEG locus is not associated with

of these
proteins. The structure of the 16.8 kDa SpaI protein from B. subtilis showed a new fold consisting of a six-stranded
antiparallel twisted β sheet architecture (Figure 19A). However, the construct
used for structural work lacked the N-terminal 17 residues and did
not confer immunity.319 The deleted region
consists largely of basic Lys residues, suggesting that these N-terminal
17 residues play a role in stabilizing the interaction between SpaI
and the acidic head groups of membrane phospholipids. The subsequent
NMR structure of the 25.8 kDa NisI from L. lactis revealed a two-domain architecture consisting of tandem repeats
of a seven-stranded β sheet fold resembling the fold in SpaI
(Figure 19A). Each
domain could be individually aligned with the structure of SpaI despite
a lack of any notable similarity in sequence. Binding of NisI to nisin
was observed by titrating in nisin and monitoring changes in the chemical
shifts of NisI, which showed that nisin binds to the C-terminal domain
of NisI (Kd of 22 μM), presumably

suggested a role for Tyr153 and Asp155 of NisI in mediating binding
to nisin.320 The solution NMR structures of SpaI,319 NisI,320 and MlbQ321 provide some rationale for the mode of actions
of these
proteins. The structure of the 16.8 kDa SpaI protein from B. subtilis showed a new fold consisting of a six-stranded
antiparallel twisted β sheet architecture (Figure 19A). However, the construct
used for structural work lacked the N-terminal 17 residues and did
not confer immunity.319 The deleted region
consists largely of basic Lys residues, suggesting that these N-terminal
17 residues play a role in stabilizing the interaction between SpaI
and the acidic head groups of membrane phospholipids. The subsequent
NMR structure of the 25.8 kDa NisI from L. lactis revealed a two-domain architecture consisting of tandem repeats
of a seven-stranded β sheet fold resembling the fold in SpaI
(Figure 19A). Each
domain could be individually aligned with the structure of SpaI despite
a lack of any notable similarity in sequence. Binding of NisI to nisin
was observed by titrating in nisin and monitoring changes in the chemical
shifts of NisI, which showed that nisin binds to the C-terminal domain
of NisI (Kd of 22 μM), presumably
along an extended hydrophobic patch. Structure-based mutational analysis

specific resistance to NAI-107-like lantibiotics.321 Like the coordinated immunity provided by LanI and LanEFG
proteins, protection against NAI-107 like lantibiotics is conferred
by several proteins, MlbJQYX.321 Although
MlbQ sequesters NAI-107 and functions analogously to NisI and SpaI,
its structure shows a novel topology consisting of four β strands
topped by two short helices (Figure 19A). Despite the lack of structural similarities, MlbQ
also contains an extended hydrophobic patch where the lanthipeptide
may bind. However, the molecular details as to how these proteins
recognize their cognate lantibiotics are still undetermined. Similarly,
the molecular mechanism of immunity is not understood in systems where nisEFG and nisI homologues are missing

nisin have been shown to encode for a different type of resistance
system.322,323 The resistance protein NSR is a protease
that cleaves the C-terminal six residues from nisin, resulting in
a significant reduction in bactericidal activity.324 More recently this system has also been found in pathogens.
An operon in Streptococcus agalactiae that confers
20-fold resistance against nisin when expressed in L. lactis contains genes for an ABC-type transporter and a membrane-associated
NSR (SaNSR).325 The crystal
structure of SaNSR consists of an S41 C-terminal
serine endopeptidase fold326 with an appended
N-terminal helical bundle and protease capping domains (Figure 19B).327 Modeling studies suggest that the C-terminal
residues of the nisin substrate could be positioned in a hydrophobic
tunnel formed between the capping and protease domains. Enzymatic
activity was contingent on the D and E rings of nisin because SaNSR could not process nisin variants that lacked these

I and II Lanthipeptides Proteases and Export in Class
I and II Lanthipeptides The late stages of lanthipeptide
biosynthesis involve proteolytic
cleavage of the leader peptide and export. The leader peptide is often
necessary to direct the secretion of the modified peptide out of the
producing organism, after which the leader peptide is removed to furnish
the mature peptide, but sometimes proteolysis precedes secretion (vide
infra). Two general strategies have been employed to accomplish these
two tasks. The first discussed in section 3.1 was long thought to be characteristic
for class I lanthipeptides and involves dedicated LanT transporters
and LanP proteases. However, more recently, genomes especially in
Proteobacteria36 and Bacteroidetes5 have been sequenced that contain class I lanthipeptide
biosynthetic gene clusters with a bifunctional transporter/protease.
For many years such bifunctional transporter/proteases were thought
to be characteristic of class II lanthipeptides. Conversely, LanP
proteins were long confined to class I lanthipeptides. The only exception
was lactocin S, a class II lanthipeptide encoded by a gene cluster
that contains genes for a dedicated LanT transporter and LanP protease.50 However, lanP genes are now
regularly detected in class II gene clusters (section 3.2). Since distinction between class I and
class II lanthipeptides based on proteolysis and transport no longer
holds, both classses are discussed here in one section. The class
II lantibiotic cinnamycin produced by Streptomyces cinnamoneus
cinnamoneus DSM 40005 is unusual as its leader peptide appears
to be removed by a protease of the general secretory (Sec) system.328 In fact, at present, lanthipeptide-specific
proteases are very frequently absent from biosynthetic gene clusters
in streptomycetes.35 The late stages of lanthipeptide

analysis of the primary sequence showed strong conservation of the
SpaT sequence with multidrug transporters and the transporter that
when mutated causes cystic-fibrosis.329 Especially characteristic are the two Walker-motif sequences involved
in ATP-binding, indicating that LanTs fall within the ABC family of

using antibodies against the leader peptide, coupled with mass spectrometric
analysis of culture supernatants, was used to determine the substrate
tolerance of the NisT transporter in L. lactis strains
bearing plasmids with various combinations of nisin biosynthetic enzymes.243 An expression strain with a plasmid containing
only the genes encoding the transporter and the precursor peptide
was capable of exporting unmodified precursor, indicating that the
lanthionine rings were not required for export. Likewise, the strain
also exported chimeras of the leader sequence fused to various biologically
active peptides, demonstrating that the NisT transporter is broadly
tolerant of substrates, as long as the leader peptide is present.243 However, kinetic analysis of peptide extrusion
using expression strains pulse-labeled with [35S]-Met indicated
that deletion of the NisB dehydratase significantly reduces the precursor
export, and a substrate-channeling mechanism between the biosynthetic
enzymes and the transporter has been invoked to explain these observations.189 Biochemical evidence for such a multiprotein
complex with the transporter has not yet been established, but, as
noted in section 2.4, yeast two-hybrid studies have suggested a physical interaction
of NisC and NisT, and NisC and NisB, and co-immunoprecipitation studies
indicated interactions between NisB and NisC and suggested a membrane

of the transporter is consistent
with removal of the leader peptide after export of the modified peptide
for most class I lanthipeptides. There are two different groups of
lanthipeptide proteases that are found in the corresponding biosynthetic
clusters. The nisin leader protease NisP is the first characterized
class I leader protease,178 and is a member
of the S8 clade of subtilisin-like proteases.333 Sequence analysis identified four regions in the NisP polypeptide
including an N-terminal 22-residue signal peptide, a prodomain consisting
of residues Glu23 through Arg195, a serine protease catalytic domain
encompassing Ser224 through Arg566, and a C-terminal ∼110-residue
peptide that contains a canonical LPxTG sorting signal to anchor the
polypeptide to the cell wall of the producer L. lactis via amidation of Thr655 with a pentaglycyl murein peptidoglycan.334 The C-terminal anchoring peptide can also be
excised from NisP by autoproteolysis, likely freeing it from the cell
wall.335 The leader peptide-dependence

the catalytic domain of the NisP protease
has been determined to 1.1 Å resolution, revealing a fold that
is similar to that observed for other S8 proteases (Figure 20A).335 Although the sequence of the prodomain was included in the protein
construct used for crystallization, the reported structure consists
only of the serine protease catalytic domain composed of Ser224 through
Arg566. SDS-PAGE analysis of dissolved crystals revealed that the
protein had undergone proteolytic degradation in situ, facilitating
crystallization of the resultant fragment consisting of residues 224–566.
The crystal structure revealed a canonical catalytic triad consisting
of Asp259, His306, and Ser512 positioned along a heart-shaped open
cleft on the protein surface.335 The NisP
active site is flanked by electron density consistent with the sequence
of the C-terminal region comprising Ala635 through Arg647, suggesting
that autocatalytic processing may separate the protein from the membrane-anchoring
C-terminal region to liberate NisP from the cell wall.335 A common feature among canonical S8 proteases
is a rearrangement of a high-affinity calcium-binding loop in the
N-terminal prodomain to displace it away from the active site following
autoprocessing, resulting in a stable structure and explaining the
calcium-dependent activity of these enzymes.336 Yet, the prodomain is absent in the reported NisP structure, suggesting
that perhaps the catalytic domain is stable in its absence. However,
at present no additional details are available that may rationalize

other nisin-like precursor peptides
identified a conserved Gly-Ala-(Xxx)2-Arg-Ile motif, wherein
NisP cleaves between the Arg and Ile residues.248 Mutational analysis of NisA variants demonstrated that
precursors in which Ala had been altered to Asp resulted in products
that had undergone post-translational modifications but from which
the leader sequence was not excised.248 Likewise, mutation of the Arg in this motif to a Gln yielded a modified
peptide product with an intact leader. Tryptic removal of the leader
peptide from the product of the Ala variant strain afforded a peptide
with bioactivity comparable to that of authentic nisin. These experiments
confirmed that leader removal must occur only after export of the
modified peptide, and is the last step in the maturation of fully
bioactive nisin. Sequence alignments of NisA with

explored through mass-spectrometric
analysis of in vitro activity of NisP-expressing cells on a series
of modified NisA peptides.243 Treatment
of fully modified NisA (mNisA) with cells displaying NisP resulted
in facile removal of the leader sequence. However, NisP was unable
to cleave the leader sequence from either unmodified NisA or a precursor
containing dehydro amino acids but lacking the lanthionine rings.
These experiments demonstrate that fully modified nisin with the thioether
linkages is the true substrate for the NisP protease. Similar substrate
specificity has been reported for the LanP involved in production
of mutacin 1140.268 A manual docking model
of the unmodified NisA peptide into the NisP active site suggests
that the installation of ring A in nisin may be necessary to induce
peptide curvature that avoids steric clashes with the enzyme (Figure 20B).337 Studies monitoring the timing of secretion
by NisT and leader peptide removal by NisP indicate that these two
processes are not tightly coupled.189 The substrate tolerance of NisP was further

as part of the cluster responsible for the production of epilancin
15X.171 Like NisP, the leader protease
from this cluster, ElxP, is a canonical S8-peptidase family serine
protease. However, unlike NisP that functions only on substrates with
the lanthionine bridges installed, recombinant ElxP can catalyze leader
peptide removal from linear, unmodified ElxA precursor peptide171,278 (although it remains to be established if the modified peptide is
a better substrate than the precursor). Residues that likely comprise
the catalytic triad of ElxP (Asp27, His62, and Ser240) were identified

from the NisP group of class I lanthipeptide leader proteases. First,
the primary sequence lacks an N-terminal secretion signal and the
C-terminal LPxTG sorting signal suggesting that ElxP is located in
the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization of ElxP suggests that
the ElxA leader is removed prior to extrusion of the mature lanthipeptide
outside of the cell, although this has not yet been definitively established.
If so, the transporter ElxT would not require a leader peptide (see section 3.2 for discussion
of transporters). Second, the recognition sequence in ElxA flanking
the cleavage site is distinct from that for NisP and related signal
proteases. An alignment of the ElxA leader sequence with those of
other homologous precursor peptides showed a conserved Asp/Glu-Leu/Val-(Xxx)2-Gln-Ser/Thr sequence at the C-terminus of the leader sequence
that is distinct from the Gly-Ala-(Xxx)2-Arg-Ile motif
found in NisA and related precursors. The Ser/Thr residue in the ElxA
motif is dehydrated by the corresponding LanB dehydratase and ElxP
cleaves after the Gln residue.278 Ala-scanning
mutational analysis of the ElxA leader peptide revealed that mutations
at Asp, Leu, or Gln of the motif resulted in a significant reduction
in cleavage efficiency by ElxP as determined by mass spectrometric
analysis.278 Michaelis–Menten kinetic
constants determined for the Gln and Leu ElxA variants indicated that kcat was decreased by more than 10-fold compared
to native ElxA, while the Km was largely
unchanged.278 Conversely, Ala mutations
at the two intervening residues within this motif had no effect on
proteolytic efficiency. Notably, although the NisA precursor is not
a substrate for ElxP, insertion of the Asp-Leu-(Xxx)2-Gln-Ala
motif present in ElxA (where the Ala mimics the Dha found in processed
ElxA precursor) into the NisA precursor yielded a chimeric peptide
that was readily cleaved by ElxP.278 Two distinguishing characteristics differentiate the ElxP structure

Enzymes While independent proteases and transporters carry

LanT proteins are members of the ABC-transporter maturation and secretion

with a protease domain have been given the same LanT designation as
the transporters without a protease domain, which is somewhat unfortunate
since it does not provide immediate indication about the type of protein.
Analogously to how the multifunctional class III lanthipeptide synthetases
have been named LanKC (for kinase and cyclase), we suggest calling
the transporters that contain a protease domain LanTp (for

lactococcin G revealed that the LagD AMS transporter also harbored
the leader peptide excision activity, which was mapped to the N-terminal
150 residues of the polypeptide.338 Subsequent
characterization of the isolated protease domains of the ComA AMS
transporter involved in quorum sensing,346 and of the CvaB AMS transporter of the colicin V secretion system,347 as well as genetic experiments on the LcnC
transporter involved in the biosynthesis of other lactococcins,339 established the general architecture for this
class of ABC-type bacteriocin transporters. The crystal structure
of the protease domain of ComA revealed an overall fold that resembled
the papain-like C39 family of Cys proteases, as predicted from the
primary sequence.348 Docking studies with
a model ComC leader peptide are consistent with the leader peptide

for a lanthipeptide
AMS protein was established through the characterization of the N-terminal
150-residue protease domain of the LctT transporter (= LctTp in the nomenclature used in this review) involved in the processing
of the class II lanthipeptide lacticin 481.349 Unlike the NisP-type class I stand-alone proteases, leader cleavage
from the LctA precursor peptide was not contingent on installation
of the lanthionine rings. Although the LctTp protease domain
could remove the leader sequence from full-length LctA precursor peptide,
a truncated 10-residue substrate, corresponding to Asp−6 through
Ser4 of the substrate, was not processed. Likewise, replacement of
residues in the leader sequence with Pro also compromised activity.349 These studies are consistent with the expectation
that a helical conformation of the leader sequence is critical for
substrate recognition by the protease. Protease activity has also
been established for the N-terminal 150 amino acids of BovTp, which removed the leader peptide from mBovA to generate the lantibiotic
bovicin HJ50 (Figure 21).350 Full reconstitution of in vitro protease activity

to other AMS transporters and
to papain-like proteases, the catalytic triad of the protease domain
of LctTp was proposed to consist of Asp106, His90, and
Cys12. Both the C12A and C12S variants were devoid of activity but
mutations at Asp106 had no effect on activity, suggesting that this
residue is not essential for catalysis.349 Surprisingly, although the H90A variant was active, this mutant
cleaved the substrate peptide at a different site, suggesting that
this residue may play a role in site specificity of amide bond hydrolysis.

of the cargo they transport and
proteolyze. Peptide chimeras, in which the LctA leader peptide was
appended to different core peptides, were processed at varying rates
by the LctTp protease domain suggesting some role of the
core sequence on substrate processing.349 Similarly, the LtnTp AMS transporter involved in biosynthesis
of lacticin 3147 has been shown to secrete various noncognate peptides
attached to the LtnA2 leader peptide and to remove the leader peptide
in the process.351 The presence of the
class II lanthionine synthetase LtnM2 (section 4) was not required for transport by LtnTp. Substrate tolerance is also demonstrated by AMS proteins
that have more than one substrate such as the transporters HalTp124,125 and LicTp103 that each transport two different modified
peptides (mHalA1 and mHalA2 for HalTp and mLicA1 and mLicA2
for LicTp, see Figure 22), and the transporter ProcTp that presumably
secretes all 30 of its substrates (section 4.1).129 Not only
are these transporters tolerant of the various cargo peptides, they
also demonstrate relaxed specificity with regard to the leader peptides
since the leader peptides of the individual precursors of two-component
peptides are quite diverse,103,124 and these transporters
can even act on noncognate leader peptides.77 Based on sequence homology and site-directed mutagenesis experiments,
an ELXnBXG-G/A/S (B is a hydrophobic residue, n = 2–8)
at the end of the leader peptide appears important for proteolytic

of the cargo they transport and
proteolyze. Peptide chimeras, in which the LctA leader peptide was
appended to different core peptides, were processed at varying rates
by the LctTp protease domain suggesting some role of the
core sequence on substrate processing.349 Similarly, the LtnTp AMS transporter involved in biosynthesis
of lacticin 3147 has been shown to secrete various noncognate peptides
attached to the LtnA2 leader peptide and to remove the leader peptide
in the process.351 The presence of the
class II lanthionine synthetase LtnM2 (section 4) was not required for transport by LtnTp. Substrate tolerance is also demonstrated by AMS proteins
that have more than one substrate such as the transporters HalTp124,125 and LicTp103 that each transport two different modified
peptides (mHalA1 and mHalA2 for HalTp and mLicA1 and mLicA2
for LicTp, see Figure 22), and the transporter ProcTp that presumably
secretes all 30 of its substrates (section 4.1).129 Not only
are these transporters tolerant of the various cargo peptides, they
also demonstrate relaxed specificity with regard to the leader peptides
since the leader peptides of the individual precursors of two-component
peptides are quite diverse,103,124 and these transporters
can even act on noncognate leader peptides.77 Based on sequence homology and site-directed mutagenesis experiments,
an ELXnBXG-G/A/S (B is a hydrophobic residue, n = 2–8)
at the end of the leader peptide appears important for proteolytic

has been investigated showing that
the protease domain is located at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.339,352 Yeast two-hybrid studies demonstrated a physical interaction between
NukTp and NukM involved in the biosynthesis of the class
II lantibiotic nukacin ISK-1 (Figure 21).353 This study also suggested
that like for class I lanthipeptides, the biosynthetic enzymes NukM
and NukTp can function independently in vitro and in heterologous
expression systems but physiologically may be in a membrane-localized
multienzyme complex. Expression of full-length NukTp in
inside-out membrane vesicles showed that mNukA, but not unmodified
NukA, was a substrate for proteolysis.354 Interestingly, this study also showed that adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) was required for proteolysis, suggesting a tight coupling between
the transport domain and the protease domain of NukTp.
Indeed, mutations in the conserved Walker motifs and H-loop of the
ATP-binding domain of NukTp resulted not only in accumulation
of mNukA inside the cells, indicating disruption of transport activity,
but also in abolishment of leader peptide removal.352 Similar observations were also made with inside-out vesicles.
Analogously, mutations to the catalytic residues in the C39 protease
domain interfered with both proteolysis and transport.352 Thus, although isolated C39 protease domains
of AMS proteins have proteolytic activity and do not need ATP, for
intact AMS proteins, proteolysis and transport appear to be cooperative. The topology of AMS proteins

into the transport cycle of LanTp and other transporters
in this family.355 At present, the function
of this peptidase-containing ATP-binding cassette transporter from Clostridium thermocellum that was identified by genome mining
is not known, but it seems to be associated with a 90-residue precursor
peptide containing a 24 amino acid leader peptide ending in GG. The
architecture of the transporter consists of three domains, an N-terminal
peptidase domain, a six-helical transmembrane domain (TMD), and a
C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) (Figure 23). Structures were obtained both in the
absence and presence of an inert nucleotide analog, revealing two
conformations of the transporter (Figure 23A,B). In the absence of bound nucleotide,
the structure reveals an inward-facing conformation wherein the transmembrane
helices of the homodimer form an open tunnel that is oriented toward
the active site of the peptidase domain. This state would position
the core peptide within the tunnel and orient the double Gly sequence
of the leader toward the peptidase domain. Nucleotide binding induces
a rotation of the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domains to close the
transmembrane tunnel. This conformational reorganization displaces
the peptidase domains, which may help facilitate translocation, and
subsequent release, of the cleaved core peptide across the membrane.355 In the nucleotide-bound structure, the transmembrane
tunnel is empty and not open to the outside, but if a core peptide
were in the cavity, it might induce formation of an extracellular
gate. The authors also noted that unlike the tunnel of the general
Sec system, which transports unfolded extended polypeptide chains
or small helices, the transmembrane cavity of the AMS protein is large
enough to accommodate a small folded protein.355 Presumably, this also extends to a post-translationally
modified core peptide in the case of RiPPs. The crystal structures of a putative AMS protein provide insights

tolerance of transporters like
NisT and ProcTp with respect to the cargo peptides (engineered
in the case of NisT243 and 30 different
natural peptides for ProcTp,129 see section 4.1). The model in which the core peptide first backs into the tunnel
can also explain more substrate-restricted systems that require the
post-translationally modified cognate peptide if the tunnel has shape
and/or charge complementarity to the post-translationally modified
peptide. Unlike the observations mentioned above for NukTp,354 the protease domain of the AMS protein
from C. thermocellum was active in the absence of
ATP.355 Instead, proteolysis was actually
inhibited by ATP binding, because the cytoplasmic opening is closed
in the ATP bound state. In this ATP-bound state the protease domains
are displaced from the membrane-spanning and nucleotide binding domains
and in this conformation the protease domains exhibit similar low
level activity as observed with excised C39 protease domains. Indeed,
in trans addition of the protease domain to the TMD-NBD fragment of
the C. thermocellum protein increased the proteolytic
activity, presumably by reconstituting a complete protein.355 Thus, like the NukTp study, the
crystallographic and biochemical characterization of the AMS protein
from C. thermocellum shows strong cooperativity between
the nucleotide-binding domain and the protease domain. One possible
explanation for the observed dependence of ATP for proteolysis in
the NukTp study is that during the first turnover perhaps
the cleaved nukacin ISK-1 may be trapped in the transmembrane tunnel
and ATP hydrolysis is required to reset the system that recognizes
the full length mNukA. Indeed, the system from C. thermocellum was only inhibited by ATP in the absence of Mg2+.355 This model explains the general

that encode for both an AMS protease-transporter and a stand-alone
S8 subtilisin-like LanP protease. Examples include the clusters encoding
the enterococcal cytolysin,360 cerecidin,133 carnolysin,361 and
lichenicidin.91 In these clusters, the
modified precursor peptide is first partially processed by the LanTp to remove the leader peptide at the double Gly motif, and
subsequently processed by the LanP protease to trim additional remaining
residues to elaborate the final product,360 as illustrated in Figure 22 for lichenicidin β.91 The
crystal structure of LicP, the LanP involved in the final processing
of lichenicidin β, shows an overall structure similar to other
S8 type subtilisin-like Ser proteases (Figure 20C).362 LicP is
autocatalytically processed to a prodomain and a catalytic domain
as in the case of NisP, but the crystal structure of LicP contains
both domains and thus provides insights into the protease activation
mechanism. Maturation of subtilisin and related proteases proceeds
by the displacement and subsequent stabilization of the N-terminus
of the catalytic domain through interactions with a requisite calcium
ion. In LicP, the equivalent calcium-binding site is replaced with
a hydrophobic pocket, and stabilization is achieved by the displacement
of Trp111 of the catalytic domain into this pocket.362 A few class II lanthipeptide biosynthetic clusters

LicTp C39 protease-transporter after the double Gly sequence
of the leader
generates an NDVNPE sequence appended to the core, and the LicP S8
protease then removes these six residues to produce the mature product
(Figure 22).91 Reconstitution
of LicP activity in vitro demonstrated that the protease is fairly
tolerant to alterations with regard to the substrate peptide, and
can excise the leader from full-length linear LicA2 precursor peptide,
a partly proteolyzed precursor peptide (containing the DVNPE sequence),
and a processed full-length precursor containing the (methyl)lanthionine
rings.362 The activity toward unmodified
precursor peptides is reminiscent of that observed for ElxP but is
notably distinct from the substrate requirements of NisP, which only
cleaves the leader sequences from fully modified precursors. However,
LicP processed the lanthionine-bearing peptide much faster than the
unmodified peptide.362 LicP could also
process a number of synthetic peptide substrates of variable sequences
incorporating the NDVNPE recognition sequence, and its tolerance toward
peptide substrates with divergent amino acids in the P′ sites
may be exploited for biotechnology.362 Processing of the mLicA2 precursor peptide by the

clusters of lacticin 481 (then also called lactococcin DR) and the
enterococcal cytolysin were sequenced and it was discovered that they
did not encode LanB and LanC proteins.340,344 Instead,
apparent fusion proteins were present that contained a C-terminal
domain that had homology with the LanC proteins,344 but N-terminal domains that did not show any obvious sequence
homology with known proteins in the database. These proteins were
designated the general term LanM,40 and
they form the basis for classifying lanthipeptides in class II. For
many years, another distinguishing feature of biosynthetic gene clusters
of class II lanthipeptides was the presence of a member of the AMS
protein family.338 These LanTp proteins contain an N-terminal papain-like C39 protease domain discussed
in section 3.2 that
typically cleaves after a double Gly motif. But as more and more genomes
have become available, genes encoding AMS proteins are also found
in gene clusters of class I lanthipeptides and the manner in which
the leader peptide is removed is becoming less uniform. Although some
mixing of class I and II biosynthetic genes is starting to appear,
for instance clusters that contain both lanM and lanC genes (see Figure 24),35 at present it is still
possible to use the presence of a LanB protein as the defining feature
of class I lanthipeptides and the presence of a LanM protein for inclusion
with class II lanthipeptides. Like the LanB proteins, which show up
in gene clusters of other RiPPs,195,202,366 LanM proteins also make appearances in other RiPP
clusters, most notably the polytheonamides,367 and also in clusters that appear to encode a new class of RiPPs
that contain D-amino acids (see section 4.6.1). In the mid 1990s, the gene

LanM proteins
are bifunctional enzymes that carry out both dehydration and cyclization
of the substrate. The currently known LanM proteins can be divided
into clusters and the main cluster is clearly subdivided into different
groups (Figure 24).36 Although the differences between these groups
are throughout the protein sequence, the most eye-catching differences
can be found in the cyclization domain and will be discussed in section 4.3. One group
comprises the majority of LanMs from Cyanobacteria368 and many of its members are encoded near multiple putative
LanA substrates and thus predicted to have high substrate tolerance
as was first demonstrated for ProcM, encoded in Prochlorococcus MIT9313.129 The genome of this organism
codes for 30 substrate peptides (ProcAs) with strongly conserved,
long leader peptides (∼70 amino acids), but relatively short
and highly diverse core peptides (Figure 25). One precursor gene is truncated and may
be a pseudogene.368 ProcM dehydrates and
cyclizes all ProcA peptides tested thus far (18)129,368 and turns them into products with single ring topologies.369 Remarkably, these ring topologies are highly
diverse (Figure 26),129,370 raising the intriguing question of how one
enzyme can make so many different products. Section 4.3 will provide a potential answer to this
question. The leader peptides of the ProcA substrates belong to a
large family of peptides resembling Nif11 nitrogen-fixing proteins
(N11P) that was first identified in a bioinformatic study.371 These Nif11 peptides are not only found as
leader peptides on lanthipeptide precursor peptides but also for other

gene disruption experiments in the clusters encoding lacticin 481
and the enterococcal cytolysin suggested the LanM proteins were essential
for lanthipeptide maturation.340,344 The C-terminal domain
that displays sequence homology with LanC proteins (section 2.3) was postulated to be responsible
for the cyclization step. However, the manner in which the dehydration
was catalyzed, presumably by the N-terminal domain, was not clear.
In 2004, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the LctM protein was
indeed capable of converting the precursor peptide LctA into a fully
dehydrated and cyclized intermediate, which after leader peptide removal
provided lacticin 481 (Figure 27),304 the founding member
of a large group of class II lanthipeptides with similar structures.373 The process required ATP and Mg2+, and follow-up experiments with inefficient substrate analogs resulted
in buildup of intermediates that were phosphorylated on the Ser and
Thr residues destined for dehydration.374 Experiments with synthetic phosphorylated LctA peptides demonstrated
that the enzyme can eliminate the phosphate group to convert phosphoSer
(pSer) and phosphoThr (pThr) into Dha and Dhb, respectively. Thus,
class II LanM enzymes utilize a very different mechanism for activation
of the side chain hydroxyl groups of Ser/Thr from the glutamylation
strategy discussed in section 2.2 for class I LanB dehydratases (Figure 28). Early

of the phosphate group from pSer

of the phosphate might require ADP to bind deeper in the active site
pocket to set up the required environment for binding the phosphorylated

phosphopeptide. Interestingly, the elimination
of the phosphate group from pSer
and pThr required ADP, suggesting that the phosphorylation and elimination
steps might take place in the same active site. In this model, elimination
of the phosphate might require ADP to bind deeper in the active site
pocket to set up the required environment for binding the phosphorylated
peptide. Also noteworthy, phosphorylated peptides are typically not
observed during in vitro reactions with class II enzymes, suggesting
that phosphate elimination is faster than dissociation of the intermediate
phosphopeptide. Although these studies revealed the molecular
mechanism of dehydration,
how the enzyme catalyzes these chemical transformations remained mostly
enigmatic. Mutagenesis experiments on LctM in which all conserved
amino acids with side chains that could be involved in catalysis376 were mutated revealed several amino acids that
appeared to be important for the phosphorylation step, including Asp242
and Asp259.377 Two other amino acid residues,
Arg399 and Thr405, were shown to be important for elimination of the
phosphate, and one residue, Lys159, appeared to be involved in both
phosphorylation and phosphate elimination.377,378 A model was proposed that made analogies to the mechanism of Ser/Thr
protein kinases, but at the sequence level no homology with such proteins
was detected. The importance of these same residues was later also
confirmed by mutagenesis of BovM involved in bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis379 and ProcM involved in the production of prochlorosins.380 More recently, the mutagenesis experiments
were placed in a structural context with the first X-ray structure
of a LanM protein, the CylM protein that generates both peptides of
the enterococcal cytolysin (Figure 29). It was fitting for this protein to be the first
structurally characterized LanM since it was also one of the first
family members for which the sequence was determined in 1994.344 Although these studies revealed the molecular

This group
of peptides displays maximum activity when two different post-translationally
modified peptides are administered together.381 For most two-component lantibiotics, one peptide, called the α-peptide,
binds to lipid II and the second β-peptide is believed to bind
to this complex to form pores in the bacterial membrane.270,307,309,382,383 Thus far, two-component lantibiotics
are confined to class II lanthipeptides, although some systems are
present in actinobacterial genomes that could possibly be two-component
lanthipeptides spanning two different classes.35 For most two-component lantibiotics, two different LanM
enzymes carry out the dehydrations and cyclizations of two different
LanA substrates that have divergent leader and core peptides, with
little or no crossover (e.g., Figure 22 for
lichenicidin).124,137,381,384,385 CylM is an exception in that it modifies both substrate peptides,
CylLS and CylLL (Figure 29).38,386 Two other unusual
aspects of the enterococcal cytolysin related to its bioactivity are
that it functions as a virulence peptide that lyses mammalian cells
including immune cells during infection,387 and that it has neither sequence nor structural homology with the
two-component lanthipeptides that bind lipid II (e.g., compare Figures 22 and 29). Cytolysin is a member of the two-component lantibiotics.

anticipated based on sequence analysis, the structure of CylM
contains two domains, an N-terminal dehydration domain and a C-terminal
cyclization domain (Figure 30A).388 The two domains do not interact
much with each other, explaining the observation by several laboratories
that dehydration and cyclization activity of LanMs can be achieved
independently by expressing the two domains individually.369,375,388−390 As expected, the cyclization domain has a structure similar to that
of NisC described in section 2.3 and will be discussed further in the next section.
Unexpectedly, however, the overall fold of the dehydration domain
bears strong resemblance to that of eukaryotic lipid kinases and lipid-kinase
like protein kinases.388 Although the overall
fold has clear structural homology, a structure-based alignment showed
that the secondary structural elements are connected in a unique manner.
Nevertheless, homology detection and structure prediction by profile
HMM-HMM (hidden Markov model) alignments391 performed for this review does identify the structural homology
between LanM enzymes and lipid kinases. The CylM structure contains
the typical N- and C-terminal lobes of Ser/Thr protein kinases, but
also the characteristic kα10 and kα11 helices usually
found in lipid kinases and lipid kinase-like protein kinases (Figure 30). Compared with
canonical lipid kinases like phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the
CylM dehydration domain is significantly larger and contains several
additional subdomains. One of those is the kinase-activation (KA)
domain that plays at least two important roles, providing catalytic
residues to the active site and ordering the activation loop. As

site-directed
mutagenesis in other LanM proteins as being critical for phosphate
elimination, Arg506 and Thr512 in CylM numbering (Figure 30B), are located in the KA
domain. Indeed mutagenesis of these two residues in CylM again resulted
in mutant enzymes that still carried out phosphorylation but were
strongly impaired in phosphate elimination. The side chains of these
two residues insert into an active site that otherwise looks strikingly
similar to typical kinases, with Asp252 and His254 on the P-loop that
activate the phosphate to be transferred from ATP to the substrate,
and Asp347 and His349 on the C-lobe that accept a proton from the
Ser/Thr nucleophile of the substrate. The active site also contains
Lys274, which in other kinases binds to the γ-phosphate of ATP
to guide it to the phosphoryl acceptor. As noted above, mutagenesis
of this residue in LctM slowed down both phosphorylation and phosphate
elimination, suggesting the Lys still engages the phosphate group
after phosphoryl transfer and facilitates elimination by stabilizing
the leaving group. The active site is completed with a series of conserved
residues including Asn352 and Asp364 that likely interact with the
nucleotide, possibly mediated by a Mg2+ ion. Since the
structure only contained AMP and not the peptide substrate, details
of the active site organization in the transition states of the two
chemical transformations are not available, but a possible model is
shown in Figure 31. The CylM structure confirmed that phosphorylation and elimination
take place in overlapping active sites, and explains why ADP needs
to be present for elimination of the phosphate from exogenously supplied
phosphorylated peptides.365,374 The two residues mentioned above that were identified by

loop.
In canonical lipid kinases this loop is disordered in the absence
of substrate or other specific interacting proteins. Phosphorylation
or autophosphorylation of residues in the activation loop often results
in an ordering of the loop to adopt a productive conformation for
substrate binding and catalysis. In CylM, the activation loop is well
ordered via multiple interactions between residues in the KA domain
and the loop (Figure 30D). The KA domain is, in turn, held in place by interactions with
a set of helices termed the capping helices. Both the KA domain and
these capping helices are currently unique to LanM proteins, and the
overall topology that results in a well-ordered activation loop may
explain why LanM enzymes essentially have constitutive kinase activity.
At present there is no evidence for autophosphorylation as an activation
mechanism.392 One question that remained
unanswered with the structure of CylM is where the leader peptide
binds. The enzyme does not contain an obvious winged helix-turn-helix
motif that engages the leader peptide in class I lanthipeptides and
many other RiPP biosynthetic enzymes (section 2.5), nor does it have the SH2-like domain
identified in NisC that may interact with the substrate (section 2.3). CylM does
contain a subdomain inserted in the cyclization domain that may be
important for substrate binding (see section 4.3.1). The second role of the KA domain is to orient the activation

ATP. The other residues are not close to the phosphorylation/elimination

BovM resulted in an 5 to 7-fold decrease in affinity for the substrate
BovA.379 The basis for the loss of affinity
is currently not known, and mapping these residues on the CylM structure
does not provide clear clues as to where substrate leader peptide

individually and carries out dehydration of the CylL substrates, suggesting
that leader peptide binding for the dehydration reaction would take
place in the N-terminal domain.388 Cyclization Cyclization Cyclization The cyclization events
in lanthipeptide biosynthesis require remarkable control over regio-
and stereoselectivity. Studies geared toward understanding the cyclization
mechanism and selectivity started with class I LanC enzymes (section 2.3) but have recently
become an intense focus in class II lanthipeptide research in light
of several unanticipated developments. First, the class II lanthipeptide
synthetase ProcM was shown to have 29 predicted substrates that appear
to undergo selective cyclization to afford a single ring topology
per substrate, with the individual topologies being highly diverse
(Figure 25 and 26; ProcM has 30 substrates but one does not have
Cys residues and hence cannot cyclize).129 Second, the two-component class II lanthipeptide cytolysin was reported
to contain (Me)Lan with both DL- and LL stereochemistry (Figure 29), constituting
the first characterized example of non-DL-stereochemistry in a lanthipeptide.38 A single enzyme, CylM, catalyzes the formation
of both DL and LL (Me)Lan in the same peptide with high stereoselectivity.393 Subsequently, similar observations were made
for the class II lanthipeptides carnolysin,361 haloduracin,38 geobacillin II,394 and the flavecins.137 These observations and the remarkable substrate tolerance of ProcM-like
proteins imply an even greater plasticity of the cyclization catalysts
than the already impressive control discussed in section 2.3. The cyclization events

than the already impressive control discussed in section 2.3. While the various
solutions for the dehydration step in lanthipeptide biosynthesis are
interesting for their evolutionary origins, chemically, the dehydration
reaction is not too challenging. However, control over a set of cyclizations
to give one final lanthipeptide product of defined ring topology and
stereochemistry catalyzed by a single enzyme with one active site
is highly impressive, and that level of control currently cannot be
achieved in synthetic organic chemistry. Consider the number of potential
products that could arise from cyclization of dehydrated CylLL, the precursor to the large peptide of cytolysin (Figure 29). Dehydrated CylLL contains three cysteines and 7 dehydro amino acids. If all
cysteines form rings, cyclization could lead to 210 possible constitutional
isomers without considering stereochemistry. If DL- and LL-stereochemistries
are both possible, and both configurations at the β-carbon of
MeLan are considered, then over 6000 potential isomeric products can
be formed. Out of over 6000 possibilities, CylM generates only one
isomer. This remarkable level of control begs the question of how
selectivity is governed. Do the enzymes or the substrates determine
selectivity or is it a combination of both? Is selectivity under kinetic
or thermodynamic control? How does ProcM take control over cyclization
to another level by doing this not for one, but 29 different substrates?
These questions have fueled much of the recent research on cyclization
in class II lanthipeptide biosynthesis. The current understanding
regarding regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of cyclization will
be discussed in sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3, respectively. While the various

Domains Structure and Phylogeny of LanM Cyclization
Domains Structure and Phylogeny of LanM Cyclization
Domains As described in section 4.2, the dehydratase domain in LanM proteins
differs entirely from that of class I LanB dehydratases, but the cyclase
domain is analogous to class I LanCs. The cyclase domain in CylM shares
with NisC the α,α-barrel fold that encapsulates a Zn2+ ion ligated by one His and two Cys residues; in the case
of CylM these residues are Cys875, Cys911, and His912 (Figure 32).388 For NisC, the peptide substrate is expected to bind at an SH2-like
substructure that resembles eukaryotic peptide-binding motifs (section 2.3), but this
feature is absent in CylM. Instead two putative substrate-binding
grooves, one in the dehydratase domain and one in the cyclase domain
near the Zn2+ ion, were observed. Interestingly, an antiparallel
β-sheet is present in the cyclase domain (Ile666-Leu690; purple
in Figure 32) near
the interface with the dehydratase domain that provides a potential
binding surface that has similarities to the leader peptide binding
region observed in NisB (section 2.5). However, incubation of CylLS with CylM(1–625)
lacking this β-sheet did not significantly alter dehydration
activity,388 suggesting that this putative
binding site is not critical for dehydration, but it might yet be
important for cyclization. Although it has not been confirmed that
the precursor peptides CylLL and CylLS have
a binding site on the cyclase domain, substrate affinity for the cyclase
domain is supported by several other studies on LanMs. In particular,
cyclase activity of isolated cyclization domains in the absence of
a dehydration domain has been observed for ProcM369 and BovM,390 implying that these
domains have substrate affinity. Although nonenzymatic cyclization
in these experiments cannot be ruled out (see section 4.3.2), the correct regioselectivity
of ring formation observed with the isolated ProcM cyclase domain
suggests that the cyclization is enzymatic.369 A role of the leader peptide in cyclization is also suggested by
investigations on the haloduracin β synthetase HalM2.238 In this study, the enzyme was shown to require
the leader peptide to catalyze the reverse of cyclization, a retro-conjugate
addition that opened up each of the four rings of haloduracin β
attached to its leader peptide (i.e., mHalA2, Figure 33). Binding interactions of LanA substrates
in both dehydration and cyclization domains were also implicated by
early yeast two-hybrid studies that suggested binding interactions
of the LctA substrate throughout the LctM protein.376 However, affinity of class II lanthipeptide precursors
for their LanM cyclase domains does not appear to be universal. NukA,
the precursor to the lanthipeptide nukacin ISK-1 (Figure 21), has much lower affinity
for the NukM cyclase domain (NukMC) than for its dehydratase
domain and no binding was detected between the leader peptide of NukA
and NukMC.389 As described in section 4.2, the dehydratase domain in LanM proteins

features
in the cyclization domain (Figures 12A and 32), a phylogenetic analysis
of these enzyme classes showed that LanM cyclase domains and LanC
enzymes fall into two different clades with deep roots, suggesting
that the cyclase domain in LanMs was not obtained by horizontal gene
transfer from LanC, unless it happened very early.36 The LanM sequence similarity network (Figure 24) shows one major cluster
and many small clusters. Much of the clustering is based on phyla.
For example, in the main cluster proteins from Firmicutes and Actinobacteria
primarily group among themselves. More interesting is the observation
that the phylogeny is reflective of the Zn2+-coordinating
ligands. Many LanMs that contain three Cys ligands for zinc instead
of two Cys ligands and one His ligand cluster together.36 The prediction of a Cys-Cys-Cys ligand environment
is based on the presence of a “CCG” instead of a “CHG”
motif370 (e.g., Cys911, His912, Gly913
for CylM), hence this subcluster is referred to as the “CCG”
group (Figure 24).
The significance of this difference in zinc ligands as it affects
reactivity is discussed in section 4.3.2. Although the importance of the “CCG”
motif was first investigated for ProcM and is found in many LanMs
from Cyanobacteria, members of various phyla contain this “CCG”
motif and cluster within this group, including Actinobacteria, Firmicutes,
Proteobacteria, and Euryarchaeota. Euryarchaeota, albeit a minor source
of LanMs, cluster almost entirely within the “CCG” group. Although LanM and LanC proteins share certain structural

Cys781 or Cys836 also resulted in reduced efficiency of cyclization
in vitro. The efficiency of dehydration was not affected suggesting

involved in lacticin 481 production (Figure 27). Two of the predicted zinc ligands of
LctM, Cys781 and Cys836, were demonstrated to be important for metal
binding as the zinc content was reduced in LctM-C781A and C836A mutants
and even further with a double mutant. Notably, mutation of either
Cys781 or Cys836 also resulted in reduced efficiency of cyclization
in vitro. The efficiency of dehydration was not affected suggesting
that these residues are only important for cyclization. Additional
molecular complexities of the cyclization event have
recently come to light; in particular, cyclization to form (Me)Lan
rings was shown to be reversible. This reversibility was demonstrated
for the class II enzyme HalM2 with its fully modified substrate mHalA2
(Figure 33), and for
the class I cyclase NisC with its fully modified substrate peptide
mNisA (section 2.3).238 mHalA2 was generated by in vitro
modification in D2O so that the intermediate enolate would
pick up deuterium instead of a proton to afford α-deuterated
(Me)Lan (Figure 34). Reexposure of α-D-labeled mHalA2 to HalM2 in H2O resulted in deuterium/protium exchange for all rings and incubation
of mHalA2 and mNisA in the presence of the requisite synthetase and
the thiol-selective electrophile N-ethylmaleimide
(NEM) resulted in alkylation of all cysteines in each peptide (Figure 34). Because these
studies show that the cyclization is reversible, the possibility of
thermodynamic control cannot be ruled out. A more definitive test
would be to expose synthetic products or intermediates with incorrect
rings to these enzymes to monitor possible correction of the incorrect
rings, but the difficulty with such a study is identifying which incorrect
ring system to prepare. As noted in section 2.3, more than 6700 different ring topologies
are possible for mNisA, and 840 for mHalA2 (Figure 33). Additional

contain
a conserved His residue (e.g., His212 for NisC; His725 for LctM and
His791 for HalM2) that has been proposed to function either as a base
that deprotonates the thiol to facilitate attack on the dehydro amino
acid or as an acid that protonates the enolate to complete cyclization.
It is unlikely that the His performs both functions given that conjugate
attack and protonation occur on opposite faces of the alkene based
on the stereochemistry of both DL- and LL-MeLan that demonstrates
a net anti addition. The ability to study the retro-conjugate addition
provided indirect insights into the role of the active site His in
HalM2 (His791). Specifically, exposure of modified deuterium-labeled
HalA2 to HalM2-H791A did not result in any deuterium exchange or ring
opening, implicating His791 in the deprotonation step of the retro-conjugate
addition, and hence protonation of the enolate during cyclization.
If His791 were responsible for thiol protonation/deprotonation then
deuterium exchange might have been observed. These findings are in
agreement with examples of related Zn-dependent enzymes that activate
thiols but do not contain an active site base for thiol deprotonation,225 and studies showing that the pKa of a thiol can be dramatically lowered on binding to
Zn (e.g., 3 orders of magnitude).219,224 The active sites of LanC cyclases and LanM cyclase domains

role in the chemoselectivity of cyclization came out of mutational
analysis of the LctM cyclase domain. Lacticin 481 was not produced
by mutant enzymes in which the Cys ligands to the zinc were replaced
by Ala,395 but some cyclization nevertheless
did occur, suggesting that the cyclization could be nonenzymatic.
Exposure of LctA(−24–20, S11A/Q20A), which contains
Cys14, Thr9, and Ser18 to LctM gave the correct A ring topology (Figure 35), but exposure
to LctM-C781A resulted in preference for a different ring topology
resulting from Cys14 attack on Dha18 instead of Dhb9.397 Thus, the substrate inherently prefers to form
Lan rings (i.e., cysteine thiols react faster with Dha than with Dhb
residues) and the enzyme is necessary to favor MeLan formation. A
similar result was obtained using truncated LctM containing only the
dehydratase domain (LctMΔcyc). Treating LctA with
the leader and core peptides in trans with LctMΔcyc resulted in a non-native Dha11-Cys14 cross-link.375 An analogous nonenzymatic cyclization is predicted for
the closely related nukacin synthetase truncant NukMΔcyc where a single ring formed,389 and similar
observations have been made for class I lanthipeptides (section 2.3). These results

the enzyme is required for cyclization.
However, LctM like most LanM enzymes, modifies only one substrate,
LctA. As discussed above, ProcM has 30 predicted substrates. It is
more difficult to imagine how one enzyme could selectively catalyze

might be nonenzymatic. Intriguingly, ProcM is distinct from LanCs,
LctM, and other characterized LanMs in that all three zinc-binding
ligands are Cys.370 Based on model studies
with low molecular weight metal complexes,226−237 the replacement of a His ligand with a Cys should increase thiolate
reactivity compared to other LanC/LanM proteins. In turn, this increased
reactivity might assist ProcM in processing so many diverse substrates. The studies on LctM suggest that
the enzyme is required for cyclization.
However, LctM like most LanM enzymes, modifies only one substrate,
LctA. As discussed above, ProcM has 30 predicted substrates. It is

catalysis was recently studied in detail for two ProcA substrates
with different ring topologies, ProcA2.8 and ProcA3.3.246 The prochlorosin products of both peptides
contain two rings but one forms nonoverlapping rings (ProcA2.8) and
the other overlapping rings (ProcA3.3) (Figure 26). A new strategy for controlling enzyme
activity was developed by generating semisynthetic ProcA2.8 and 3.3
substrate analogs in which one Cys was free to react and the other
Cys was blocked with an ortho-nitrophenyl protecting group that can
be removed by photolysis. This strategy allowed investigation of nonenzymatic
cyclization after preorganization of the peptide by enzymatic installation
of another ring. Thus, two different monoprotected variants of both
ProcA2.8 and ProcA3.3 were first subjected to enzymatic cyclization
to form one ring. Then ProcM was removed, the protected thiol was
uncaged, and nonenzymatic cyclization was monitored at pH 8.0 or pH
8.5 (Figure 36). In
all four peptides investigated, nonenzymatic cyclization was much
slower than enzymatic cyclization, suggesting that ring formation
in prochlorosins 2.8 and 3.3 is enzymatic. One advantage of this approach
is that the individual cyclization events can be monitored one at
a time, which is not possible in the previously discussed approaches
that rely on mutagenesis and separation of the dehydration and cyclization
domains. The possible involvement of nonenzymatic cyclization during ProcM

dehydration and cyclization are
distinct. While both processes are ordered, dehydration occurs with
C-to-N directionality (see section 4.4) but cyclization does not appear to be directional.
Cyclization is ordered but the order depends on the substrate and
it appears the smaller rings form faster.246 Notably, in the ProcA3.3 substrate described above where B ring
formation was blocked, cyclization in the presence of ProcM afforded
primarily an incorrect, smaller ring, ultimately resulting in a derivative
with two nonoverlapping small rings (Figure 36B). The importance of the unique ligand
set of ProcM was shown by the formation of the same incorrect ring
topology upon exposure of the ProcA3.3 precursor peptide to ProcM-C971H,
in which the Cys-Cys-Cys ligand set was mutated to the more common
Cys-Cys-His coordination environment. The cyclization reactions catalyzed
by the mutant were also significantly slower than with wild-type ProcM,369 suggesting that ProcM uses the competitive
advantage of a zinc site with increased reactivity offered by a third

present, all studies on both class I and class II lanthipeptides
suggest that the enzyme catalyzes all cyclizations and is responsible
for facilitating the correct ring formation. However, several investigations
have demonstrated that both the enzyme and the substrate are critical
to the observed cyclization selectivity, and, for some systems, the
ring topology may be encoded in the substrate sequence itself. Phylogenetic
analysis of LanMs shows that enzymes that produce lanthipeptides with
similar structure do not necessarily cluster together,36 suggesting that the ring topology may be defined
by the substrate sequence, not by the LanM. In support of this hypothesis,
several class II lanthipeptides have been prepared correctly using
the synthetic machinery of completely different lanthipeptides. For
example, ProcM modified the core peptide of LctA fused to the ProcA3.2
leader peptide to afford the correct ring topology of lacticin 481.36 This finding is remarkable since the LctA core
peptide and the resulting ring topology are very different from any
of the 30 ProcA substrates of ProcM. Furthermore, as discussed in section 4.4, the LctM-catalyzed
post-translational modifications that lead to lacticin 481 are a highly
coordinated set of reactions. Interestingly, the enzyme and the peptide
substrate do not even need to be from the same lanthipeptide class
to facilitate cyclization of a dehydrated peptide to a bioactive product.
The nisin maturation enzymes were used to modify two putative class
II lanthipeptide sequences from one gene cluster for which the natural
products had never before been accessed.185 The core peptides of the putative class II LanAs were fused to the
NisA leader and the hybrid peptides were expressed with the NisBC
enzymes, which resulted in antibacterial peptides after leader peptide
removal. It would be interesting to determine the structures of both
the natural products and the products formed by NisBC to find out
if they are the same. In addition to these studies that suggest the
lanthipeptide substrates have an inherent preference for the observed
regioselectivity of cyclization, investigations discussed in section 4.3.3 provide
support for a role of the substrate in controlling the stereochemical
outcome of cyclization. Thus, lanthipeptide cyclization may have commonalities
with protein folding. The substrate peptide may already have a propensity
to form a certain ring topology and stereochemistry because of its
conformational energy landscape. Lanthipeptide cyclases could serve
like folding chaperones to steer the peptide into the desired conformation
or to let it adopt its preferred conformation and to then lock this
conformation by catalyzing covalent cross-link formation. At

chemo- and regioselectivity of cyclization could be governed
via either thermodynamic or kinetic control based on the experiments
described above evidencing the reversibility of cyclization (section 4.3.1). In the
thermodynamic case, intermediates would ultimately funnel predominantly
to the product with the lowest free energy and this would not be determined
by the enzyme. Under kinetic control, the transition state energies
for formation of the correct rings would be lower than those for formation
of incorrect rings. Kinetic control could be exerted entirely by the
enzyme by only allowing certain transition states to be attainable
through the active site geometry. Alternatively, kinetic control could
be entirely governed by the conformational energy landscape of the
peptide when bound to the protein, where the enzyme would only increase
the reactivity of the Cys nucleophile and dehydro amino acid (Dhx)
electrophile, but which Cys reacts with which Dhx would be determined
by the substrate sequence. The latter situation is likely the case
for ProcM. Finally, and probably the most likely scenario for most
lanthipeptide biosynthetic enzymes (see section 4.4), it could be a combination of both, where

an explanation for
how ProcM could form so many ring topologies selectively.246,369 As in the experiments that determined the reversibility of cyclization
for NisC (section 2.3) and HalM2 (section 4.3.1), fully modified ProcA2.8 and 3.3 substrates were produced
by ProcM in D2O, resulting in deuterium incorporation in
every ring. These mProcA peptides were then exposed to ProcM in H2O. In contrast to the observations with NisC and HalM2, D/H
exchange generally did not occur or was inefficient, and free Cys
could not be trapped with an electrophile such as NEM.246 These observations suggest that the first step
of a retro-conjugate addition reaction, deprotonation at the α-carbon
of Lan/MeLan, may still be possible, but that ring opening did not
occur. One likely explanation for the different observations is that
NisC and HalM2 have coevolved with their respective substrates to
make a single product whereas ProcM makes 30 different products. Thus,
NisC and HalM2 will have a certain amount of shape and charge complementarity
with their products, and therefore have the necessary affinity for
the final product and intermediates to catalyze retro-conjugate addition
reactions. On the other hand, ProcM cannot be complementary in shape
and/or electrostatics with its 30 products and their intermediates.
Hence, the fully modified core peptides likely do not have much if
any affinity for the cyclization active site. Another piece of evidence
against thermodynamic control for ProcM was obtained by exposure of
incorrectly cyclized ProcA3.3 or an incorrectly cyclized intermediate
to the enzyme, which did not result in conversion to the correct ring
topology.369 As noted above, the reversibility
observed for HalM2 and NisC does not necessarily mean that their reactions
are under thermodynamic control because it has not been demonstrated
whether HalM2 and NisC could convert incorrectly cyclized products
to the natural products. Thermodynamic control was first suggested as
an explanation for
how ProcM could form so many ring topologies selectively.246,369 As in the experiments that determined the reversibility of cyclization
for NisC (section 2.3) and HalM2 (section 4.3.1), fully modified ProcA2.8 and 3.3 substrates were produced
by ProcM in D2O, resulting in deuterium incorporation in
every ring. These mProcA peptides were then exposed to ProcM in H2O. In contrast to the observations with NisC and HalM2, D/H
exchange generally did not occur or was inefficient, and free Cys
could not be trapped with an electrophile such as NEM.246 These observations suggest that the first step
of a retro-conjugate addition reaction, deprotonation at the α-carbon
of Lan/MeLan, may still be possible, but that ring opening did not
occur. One likely explanation for the different observations is that
NisC and HalM2 have coevolved with their respective substrates to
make a single product whereas ProcM makes 30 different products. Thus,
NisC and HalM2 will have a certain amount of shape and charge complementarity
with their products, and therefore have the necessary affinity for
the final product and intermediates to catalyze retro-conjugate addition
reactions. On the other hand, ProcM cannot be complementary in shape
and/or electrostatics with its 30 products and their intermediates.

Class II Lanthipeptide
Cyclization As discussed in the previous section, the ring
topology in class II lanthipeptide biosynthesis is at least in part
determined by the substrate sequence but the enzyme is required to
enforce selectivity. Interestingly, a similar explanation has been
offered for stereoselectivity in which the substrate sequence is largely
responsible for the stereochemical outcome. Until very recently it
was thought that all rings in lanthipeptides had DL stereochemistry,
which results from attack of cysteine onto the Si-face of the dehydro amino acid and subsequent enolate protonation
to result in a net anti addition (note, only for Dhb are the two faces
at the β-carbon stereogenic and hence only for Dhb is the Si-face defined). Alternatively, LL stereochemistry would
arise from an anti addition via attack of Cys onto
the Re-face of the alkene. In 2013, unusual results
were reported for the two-component class II lanthipeptide cytolysin
consisting of CylLL″ and CylLS″
(Figure 29).38 Cytolysin was demonstrated to contain both DL-
and LL-(Me)Lan structures by peptide hydrolysis and subsequent GC-MS
analysis. CylLS″ contains an LL-MeLan A-ring and
a DL-Lan B-ring, and CylLL″ contains an LL-MeLan
A-ring, an LL-Lan B-ring, and a DL-Lan C-ring (Figure 29). For each of the LL rings, the precursor
sequence is Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys (Xxx = any amino acid except Cys)
providing the first hint that the substrate might be responsible for
the stereoselectivity. Although LL stereochemistry had not been seen
until the report on cytolysin in 2013, a careful analysis of other
lanthipeptides revealed the presence of the Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys sequence
as likely intermediates for the biosynthesis of several other compounds,
and indeed they all contain LL-(Me)Lan.137,361,394 Three other lanthipeptides,
cerecidins A1 and A7, isolated from a Bacillus cereus gene cluster,133 and lichenicidin β
isolated from various Bacillus licheniformis strains
contain a putative Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys motif (Figure 22) and are therefore predicted to have LL stereochemistry.
The dehydrated precursor peptide to prochlorosin 1.6 (Figure 25) also potentially contains
this motif but the sites of dehydration, and its ring topology and
stereochemistry, have not yet been determined. At present LL stereochemistry

has only been reported for class II lanthipeptides. Given that
LL stereochemistry is only observed upon cyclization of the Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys
motif, the substrate is clearly important for determining stereoselectivity.
Furthermore, the enzymes that contain the motif in their substrates
generate both DL and LL stereochemistry in their products (e.g., see Figures 29 and 33 for cytolysin and haloduracin). The reasons for
the observed selectivity have been the focus of both experimental
and computational investigations. First, the role of the enzyme was
explored by replacing the leader peptide of CylLS with
a different class II leader peptide and exposing this hybrid substrate
to the enzyme associated with the leader peptide. This approach was
used with leader peptides of HalA2, ProcA3.2, and LtnA2 and their
respective cognate modification enzymes HalM2, ProcM, and LtnM2, respectively.
ProcM and LtnM2 do not natively form rings with LL stereochemistry
in their physiological substrates. Nevertheless, the major product
with all three hybrid peptides that differed in their leader peptides
but contained the CylLS core peptide contained an A ring
with LL stereochemistry.393 In a follow
up experiment, dehydrated CylLS was generated and cyclized
nonenzymatically,396 again affording the
LL-Lan A-ring as the major product. Remarkably, the nonenzymatic cyclization
occurred rapidly at pH 7.5,396 whereas
other nonenzymatic cyclizations for lanthionine formation require
pH 8 or higher and are very slow.246 Thus,
the Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys sequence appears to not only preferentially
form LL stereochemistry but to also greatly facilitate the cyclization
reaction. Given that

reaction. To better understand the substrate requirements for
LL stereoselectivity,
both CylM-catalyzed and nonenzymatic cyclizations were attempted on
substrates where the underlined Dhx in the Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys motif was mutated to Ala.396 For CylLS-T2A, which after dehydration resulted in a
Dhb-Ala-Pro-Ala-Cys sequence, nonenzymatic cyclization was extremely
sluggish but the CylM-catalyzed reaction still favored LL stereochemistry
although with reduced diastereoselectivity. To facilitate nonenzymatic
cyclization, the Dhb of the mutant was replaced with Dha (A-ring sequence:
Dha-Ala-Pro-Ala-Cys);396 nonenzymatic cyclization
of this substrate took place but with the canonical DL stereoselectivity.
These results suggest that CylM is enforcing the LL stereoselectivity
even in the absence of the Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys sequence and against
the inherent preference of the substrate. Similar findings were also
reported for the biosynthesis of geobacillin II.394 On the other hand, exposure of HalA2-T2A (A-ring sequence:
Dhb-Ala-Trp-Pro-Cys) to HalM2 resulted in preferential DL-ring formation.393 Thus, whether or not the enzyme overrides the
inherent selectivity of a mutant substrate is system-dependent. To better understand the substrate requirements for

by the Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys motif have been illuminated through computational
analysis.393 The A rings for CylLS and HalA2 derive from Dhb-Dhb-Pro-Ala-Cys and Dhb-Dhb-Trp-Pro-Cys,
respectively (Figure 29 and 33). For both, computational analysis
showed that Re-face attack to give the LL stereochemistry
is favored. For the CylLS A ring Re-face
attack is favored over Si-face attack by 3.2 kcal
mol–1, whereas for the HalA2 A-ring the transition
state difference is 1.9 kcal mol–1. Interestingly,
although both favor Re-face attack, the conformations
of the lowest energy transition states differ greatly. For CylLS, the negative charge buildup on the reactive Dhb carbonyl
is stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network from Ala and Cys backbone
amide hydrogens. On the contrary, the HalA2 transition state is much
less ordered. For HalA2, the T2A mutation shown experimentally to
result in DL selectivity for the A ring even in the presence of its
synthetase (which installs LL stereochemistry for the native sequence),
was also modeled computationally. This mutation results in a minor
conformational change, but it is significant enough that Si-face attack is now favored, consistent with the substrate determining
the stereochemical outcome in this case. The molecular origins of the stereoselectivity and reactivity induced

analysis.393 The A rings for CylLS and HalA2 derive from Dhb-Dhb-Pro-Ala-Cys and Dhb-Dhb-Trp-Pro-Cys,
respectively (Figure 29 and 33). For both, computational analysis
showed that Re-face attack to give the LL stereochemistry
is favored. For the CylLS A ring Re-face
attack is favored over Si-face attack by 3.2 kcal
mol–1, whereas for the HalA2 A-ring the transition
state difference is 1.9 kcal mol–1. Interestingly,
although both favor Re-face attack, the conformations
of the lowest energy transition states differ greatly. For CylLS, the negative charge buildup on the reactive Dhb carbonyl
is stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network from Ala and Cys backbone
amide hydrogens. On the contrary, the HalA2 transition state is much
less ordered. For HalA2, the T2A mutation shown experimentally to
result in DL selectivity for the A ring even in the presence of its
synthetase (which installs LL stereochemistry for the native sequence),
was also modeled computationally. This mutation results in a minor
conformational change, but it is significant enough that Si-face attack is now favored, consistent with the substrate determining
the stereochemical outcome in this case. Additional efforts
have been undertaken to understand how and why
LL stereochemistry is incorporated in select lanthipeptides. Notably,
many of the LL-rings are located at the N-terminus of the core peptide
such as for geobacillin II,394 haloduracin
β,38 CylLS″,38 CrnA2′,361 and the flavecins.137 The effect of ring
size on LL stereoselectivity was also explored. Precursors were designed
for CylLL that increased or decreased the ring size (i.e.,
Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys or Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Cys), and for both the stereoselectivity
switched to DL.396 All of these results
suggest that the Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys motif is important for the LL-stereochemical
preference and that perhaps the substrates evolved to form LL-rings
at very precise positions. Additional efforts

how important the LL stereochemistry
is for the bioactivities of these peptides but it seems likely that
there is a reason why they evolved this stereochemistry, just as in
other natural products where the stereochemistry is generally critical
and altering it has drastic effects on the bioactivity. Before the
realization that these LL-rings existed, stereochemistry had not been
extensively explored in lanthipeptide biosynthesis. In a recent effort
to understand the role of stereochemistry for lanthipeptides, LL stereochemistry
was incorporated synthetically into lacticin 481, which naturally
only contains DL-rings. Three mutants were prepared each with one
of the rings changed to LL stereochemistry.398 Interestingly, all three diastereomers had retention times by HPLC
distinct from that of wild-type lacticin 481 prepared in the same
manner, suggesting that the LL diastereomers adopt quite different
conformations. Growth inhibition assays showed that all three diastereomers
did not display any antimicrobial activity. In these examples, native
DL stereochemistry was changed to LL stereochemistry. Conversely,
at present little is known whether the LL stereochemistry is important
for the activity of the molecules where it is found naturally. The
only information currently available is that changing the LL-stereochemistry
in the small subunit of cytolysin (CylLS″) to DL
using synthetic chemistry did not affect the hemolytic activity of
cytolysin but did decrease its antimicrobial activity 10-fold.399 At this point, it is mostly unknown

in lanthipeptides
is generally important, an unusual example of a lack of stereochemical
control was reported in the biosynthesis of the two-component lanthipeptide
bicereucin. Bicereucin is the first example of a two-component lanthipeptide
where one of the components, bicereucin α, does not contain
(Me)Lan as there are no cysteines in the precursor peptide (Figure 37).400 The second component, bicereucin β, contains
a single C-terminal Lan. Oddly, unlike what has been observed for
other lanthipeptides, cyclization of this ring by BsjM is not stereoselective
in vitro, but the cross-link in bicereucin β is important to
the bioactivity. It is possible that the stereochemistry is not important
in this case but the independent bioactivity of the two diastereomers
has not been evaluated. The lack of selectivity may be explained by
the fact that the bicereucin lanthipeptide synthetase BsjM lacks two
of the Cys-Cys-His/Cys zinc ligands and active site His catalytic
acid conserved in other LanCs and LanM cyclase domains. In other words,
its cyclization active site appears disrupted. Recent genome mining
has shown that several LanMs lack some or all of these conserved active
site residues, and many of their substrates lack Cys suggesting coevolution
of the LanA and LanM cyclization domain.35,368 These LanMs lacking conserved active site residues do not appear
to cluster in the SSN (Figure 24). For example, both BsjM and NpnM, a LanM that also
lacks the active site His acid and processes cysteine-free LanAs (see section 4.6.1), cluster
separately from each other but with LanMs featuring fully conserved
cyclization active sites. It is important to note that the class III
LanKC enzymes also lack these active site residues and yet catalyze
cyclization (see section 5). Interestingly, a bioinformatics genome mining study identified
clusters that are very similar to that of bicereucin.35 These clusters also contain two substrate peptides with
one lacking Cys, and a dehydrogenase that likely reduces Dhx to the
corresponding D-amino acid (see section 4.6.1). But instead of only a LanM they contain
both a LanM and a LanKC.35 It remains to
be determined whether these are class III two-component lanthipeptides. Although these studies predict that stereochemistry

Events Communication between Dehydration and Cyclization
Events Class II lanthipeptide synthetases catalyze a remarkable
number of reactions on a substrate that changes shape with each consecutive
transformation. As noted, these enzymes typically carry out their
iterative reactions with defined order.238,246,364,375 Some operate with clear directionality (N-to-C terminus or vice
versa) whereas others follow a process that is not directional but
is still ordered; for some enzymes like ProcM, the directionality/order
is dependent on what substrate the enzyme acts on.246 Although many questions still remain, in recent years the
mechanisms by which the enzymes control the order in which they catalyze
these multiple chemical processes have slowly been coming into focus.
One very useful tool developed in recent years is the use of synthetic
isotopically labeled substrates in which a single Ser or Thr residue
is labeled at the α-carbon with deuterium.401 This label allows determination of the timing of dehydration
of the labeled residue since it involves loss of 19 Da whereas the
dehydration of all other Ser/Thr in the peptide involve loss of 18
Da (Figure 38).401 By using a series of synthetic peptides in
which the labeled Ser/Thr is at different positions, the order of
dehydration can be established even in cases where cyclization prevents
use of tandem MS approaches to follow the timing of each dehydration.
This technique has been used to study both class II and class III
dehydration, including the assignment of C-to-N directionality for
ProcM dehydration.246,247,375,401 Another important development
in advancing our understanding has been the establishment of quantitative
methods to measure the kinetics of individual dehydration and cyclization
reactions by mass spectrometry and the use of computer programs to
evaluate various kinetic models. This approach was first used for
HalM2, the enzyme that makes the β-peptide of the two-component
lantibiotic haloduracin (Figure 33) and ProcM, the single enzyme that makes 30 different
prochlorosins (section 4.1).365 With HalM2, a series of interesting
observations was made. The enzyme had already been shown to function
with N-to-C terminal directionality.238,364 The kinetic
analysis demonstrated that the enzyme alternates between dehydrating
and cyclizing its HalA2 substrate peptide.365 After a certain number of dehydrations has occurred, the first cyclization
takes place. Subsequent dehydrations do not happen until after the
first cyclization. One possible explanation for the latter observation
is that each formation of a ring brings the more C-terminally located
Ser/Thr closer to the leader peptide, and possibly to the dehydration
active site. Another important observation was that after a relatively
slow initiation process, subsequent cyclization reactions are progressively
faster as if each ring formation either improves the productive interaction
with the enzyme or facilitates the subsequent ring formation by adopting
a conformation that favors cyclization. In the former explanation,
the enzyme and final product could potentially be complementary in
shape and/or electrostatics.365 The complete
reversibility of the cyclization process with HalM2 (section 4.3.1) is an
indirect demonstration that the intermediates and final cyclized product
can bind reasonably well to the cyclization active site.238 Class II lanthipeptide synthetases catalyze a remarkable

(B). Residue-specific incorporation of deuterium
at the α-carbon
of Ser/Thr enables monitoring of the directionality of dehydration.
Dehydration of unlabeled Ser/Thr involves a loss of 18 Da (A), whereas
dehydration of α-deuterated Ser/Thr involves a loss of 19 Da
(B). A final interesting observation
is that in general the rate constants
of the various dehydration and cyclization steps performed by HalM2
are quite similar, such that many intermediates are observed (no step
is strongly rate limiting) and several parallel pathways are operational.
Parallel pathways have also been observed for NisB dehydration245 and catalysis by class III synthetases.247,401 This observation is not too surprising since a very tightly ordered
process in which only a specific mandatory order of events leads to
the final product seems difficult to achieve with a single iterative
enzyme. In addition, such a scenario would likely render these enzymes
much less substrate tolerant than they are. On the other hand, given
that dehydration and cyclization steps are very different chemical
reactions and that the substrate is constantly changing, the similarity
in rate constants is surprising. It suggests that perhaps the overall
rate of each reaction may not be governed by chemistry but perhaps
by a physical step. One possibility would be that the overall rates
of reaction are determined by conformational sampling, in which after
leader peptide binding, the core peptide samples the dehydration and
cyclization active sites.365 For some intermediates,
a dehydration might be the energetically best next reaction, and for
other intermediates a cyclization step may be favored, either because
of preferred binding of the intermediate in one of the active sites
(Km-like effect), or because of faster
chemistry (kcat-like effect). Although
the details remain to be elucidated and likely will require molecular
dynamic simulations, collectively, these findings paint a picture
of coevolution of the substrate sequence with the LanM enzyme to arrive
at the present-day well-orchestrated post-translational modification
process that results in a powerful antibiotic with nanomolar minimal
inhibitory concentrations against select bacteria. A final interesting observation

of ProcM provided a completely different picture.365 As noted in section 4.1, this enzyme has 30 different substrates
with highly diverse core peptides that are converted into a library
of cyclic peptides with very different ring topologies (Figures 25 and 26). Thus, it is difficult to imagine an active site
that could be shape and/or charge complementary with all 30 of its
products. Indeed, the kinetics of processing of the ProcA substrates
investigated thus far suggests that this is not the case. Unlike HalM2,
which alternates dehydration and cyclization steps, ProcM first dehydrates
all Ser and Thr in the core peptides of those ProcA substrates that
have been analyzed.246,365,369 The kinetics of dehydration are not very different from those observed
for dehydration of HalA2 by HalM2, but the cyclizations by ProcM are
significantly slower, and contrary to HalM2, ProcM slows down with
each successive cyclization reaction. This observation suggests that,
once a ring has been installed, the intermediate becomes a less good
substrate for subsequent cyclizations, presumably because, unlike
HalM2, ProcM has not evolved for optimal catalysis to form just one
product. Thus, increased substrate tolerance comes at the expense
of slower kinetics. Why the cyanobacteria that utilize this group
of ProcM-like enzymes put a larger premium on a diversity of products
over optimizing one product is at present not clear. The limited resources
available to many of these organisms living in the nutrient-poor open
ocean and the associated small genomes402,403 may offer
an explanation. The advantages provided by a system that very efficiently
uses minimal genetic information for the production of a library of
compounds would likely be of more value under these circumstances.
A different question is what the functions are of these lanthipeptides
and how the diversity is maintained, preventing the system to evolve
to make one particular compound. The former question is still entirely
unclear, whereas one possible answer to the latter question is that
these molecules act together, in which case there would be evolutionary
pressure on keeping ProcM substrate tolerant.404 While on the surface the sequences of the 30 core peptides
and their associated products appear very diverse or even random,
mutagenesis experiments suggest that the ring topologies made from
these core peptides have some inherently favorable attributes that
make them particularly tolerant to further sequence diversification
within the constraints of an existing ring topology.405 Similarly, these experiments show that ProcM cannot turn
just any sequence into a well-defined cyclic product. It appears that
the sequences, diverse as they are, evolved because they are prone
to make a single product of defined topology. These results fit well
with the proposal described in section 4.3 that the outcome of the cyclization process
is determined by the substrate peptide. Kinetic analysis

to class I lanthipeptides, the leader peptide in the biosynthesis
of class II lanthipeptides is required for the efficient installation
of the (Me)Lan cross-links144,150,151 but is often not required for tailoring modifications as discussed
in section 4.6. Studies
showing that non-natural substrates can be processed by LanMs if they
are fused to the cognate leader peptide confirmed an important role
for the leader peptide in facilitating PTMs. For example, as described
in section 4.3.2, the class II synthetase ProcM can modify the LctA core fused to
the ProcA3.2 leader peptide to afford lacticin 481.36 Extensive studies on the lacticin 481 synthetase LctM both
in vitro and in vivo have shown that this enzyme can modify a variety
of peptides fused to the LctA leader.81,269,304,397,406−408 Some examples include a truncated LctA core
lacking 7397 or 14304 C-terminal residues, core peptides of the class II lanthipeptides
nukacin ISK-1 and mutacin II,406,407 and completely unrelated
peptides.81 One limitation to LctM processing
also evidenced for class I and III lanthionine synthases is that the
dehydratable residues must be a certain distance from the leader peptide,
presumably in order for those residues to access the active site.269 Although LanM proteins clearly recognize the
leader peptide, it is important to note that LanM recognition of the
core peptide is also generally predicted. For example, although an
LctA leader-NukA core fusion can be processed by LctM to afford nukacin
ISK-1 both in vivo407 and in vitro,406 in vivo experiments have shown that NukM, the
LanM involved in nukacin ISK-1 production (Figure 21), does not convert a NukA leader-LctA core
fusion to lacticin 481,407 suggesting that

biosynthesis where a cocrystal structure of NisA and NisB witnessed
interactions between the leader peptide and enzyme as described in section 2.5, the precise
molecular interactions involved in leader peptide binding have not
been elucidated for any class II lanthipeptide synthetases. No crystal
structures of substrate-bound LanM synthetases have been solved but
the first crystal structure of a LanM (CylM) was recently reported.388 Interestingly, the leader peptide binding domain
found in class I dehydratases is not conserved in CylM, suggesting
an alternative mechanism of leader peptide binding to the enzyme.
This hypothesis of an alternative mechanism is further substantiated
by differences in the leader peptide sequences. Class II lanthipeptide
leaders lack the conserved FNLD motif found in class I substrates
and are instead characterized by the incorporation of many negatively
charged residues as well as a conserved C-terminal ELXXBX motif (e.g.,
positions −3 to −8 for LctA and NukA), where B is a
hydrophobic residue (Val, Leu, or Ile). Truncants of LctA,304 NukA,407 and ProcA2.8
precursor peptides368 containing this motif
but shortened at the N-terminus (by 8, 9, and 40 residues, respectively)
were fully processed by their respective LanM enzymes, illustrating
that unlike class I, the leader peptide recognition site is located

of the conserved leader peptide residues for the
efficiency of PTMs has been explored in vitro for lacticin 481406 and bovicin HJ50,379 and in vivo for nukacin ISK-1407 and
mutacin II.345 Most point mutations did
not dramatically reduce production of the natural products and the
effects of mutations were similar among the three systems. Notably,
incorporation of a charged residue at positions −4 or −7
reduced processing efficiency.345,379,406,407 Incorporation of proline within
the ELXXBX motif as evaluated for lacticin 481 and nukacin ISK-1 resulted
in reduced LctM efficiency406 or little
or no lanthipeptide production,407 respectively.
The detrimental effect of Pro incorporation suggests that the leader
peptide may adopt a helical conformation. Indeed, structural prediction
tools have predicted helical regions encompassing the ELXXBX motif
for the LctA406 and NukA leader peptides407 and the NukA peptide adopts a partial helical
structure in trifluoroethanol as determined by CD.407 However, more definitive evidence is required as similar
predictions were made for the NisA leader peptide,257 but the cocrystal structure with NisB subsequently revealed
that the leader peptide engaged the enzyme in an extended conformation.
Interestingly, the in vitro mutagenesis studies also hint that the
binding interactions with LanM proteins during dehydration and cyclization
may differ.406 Although the point mutations
E–8P, D–6P, and I–4P in LctA all result in much
reduced dehydration efficiency, the effects of these mutations on
cyclization are distinct. Cyclization of fully dehydrated mLctA goes
to completion for the D–6P and I–4P mutants but not
for the E–8P mutant. The requirement of the leader peptide
for retro-conjugate addition238 and the
independent activities of separately expressed dehydration and cyclization
domains369,396 also suggest potentially separate interactions
of these domains with the leader peptide. The importance

the leader peptide is recognized by the enzyme,
the mechanism of how this interaction facilitates catalysis has been
under considerable investigation. One possible mechanism proposed
early on is that binding of the leader peptide to the enzyme induces
a conformational change to expose the enzyme active site and promote
post-translational modification. However, in 2007 it was reported
that LctM does not absolutely require the leader peptide for dehydration
although the efficiency was dramatically reduced409 and the same observations have since been reported for
HalM2.385 In trans supplementation of the
LctA core peptide with the LctA leader peptide partially restored
LctM processing,409 indicating that the
leader and core do not need to be fused as has also been described
for class I lanthipeptides in section 2.5 and some class III enzymes in section 5.3. As the leader
peptide is not required for catalysis, a mechanism in which the leader
peptide induces a conformational change seems unlikely. Instead, this
data suggests a conformational selection model150 in which the enzyme exists in the absence of the precursor
peptide in an equilibrium of inactive and active forms, favoring the
inactive form (Figure 39). Binding of the leader peptide stabilizes the active form, shifting
the equilibrium to increase the concentration of active enzyme. The
core peptide brought in proximity by the leader is then able to bind
at the enzyme active site. Support for this synergistic leader and
core peptide binding model has been reported for some enzymes as discussed
below. Further support for the conformational selection model came
from the development of a constitutively active fusion (ConFusion)
enzyme where LctM is connected through its N-terminus by a short linker
to the LctA leader peptide (LctCE-GS15).408 The model predicts that since LctCE-GS15 is
constantly in proximity to the leader peptide, the enzyme population
should favor the active form resulting in efficient processing. In
the event, treatment of the LctA core with LctCE-GS15 gave
4-fold dehydrated LctA as the major species after 3 h whereas the
otherwise identical in trans experiment with a 1:1 ratio of LctA leader
and LctM mimicking the ConFusion stoichiometry gave 3-fold dehydrated
LctA as the major species.408 In addition to how
the leader peptide is recognized by the enzyme,
the mechanism of how this interaction facilitates catalysis has been
under considerable investigation. One possible mechanism proposed
early on is that binding of the leader peptide to the enzyme induces
a conformational change to expose the enzyme active site and promote
post-translational modification. However, in 2007 it was reported
that LctM does not absolutely require the leader peptide for dehydration
although the efficiency was dramatically reduced409 and the same observations have since been reported for
HalM2.385 In trans supplementation of the
LctA core peptide with the LctA leader peptide partially restored
LctM processing,409 indicating that the
leader and core do not need to be fused as has also been described
for class I lanthipeptides in section 2.5 and some class III enzymes in section 5.3. As the leader
peptide is not required for catalysis, a mechanism in which the leader
peptide induces a conformational change seems unlikely. Instead, this
data suggests a conformational selection model150 in which the enzyme exists in the absence of the precursor
peptide in an equilibrium of inactive and active forms, favoring the
inactive form (Figure 39). Binding of the leader peptide stabilizes the active form, shifting
the equilibrium to increase the concentration of active enzyme. The
core peptide brought in proximity by the leader is then able to bind
at the enzyme active site. Support for this synergistic leader and
core peptide binding model has been reported for some enzymes as discussed
below. Further support for the conformational selection model came
from the development of a constitutively active fusion (ConFusion)
enzyme where LctM is connected through its N-terminus by a short linker
to the LctA leader peptide (LctCE-GS15).408 The model predicts that since LctCE-GS15 is
constantly in proximity to the leader peptide, the enzyme population
should favor the active form resulting in efficient processing. In

To investigate the relative roles of the leader and core peptide in
LanM binding, modification of haloduracin precursor peptide chimeras
(HalA1-A2, containing the A1 leader and A2 core, and HalA2-A1) was
explored.385 Exposure of HalA1-A2 to HalM1
and HalA2-A1 to HalM2 resulted in 5 and 2 dehydrations as the major
species, respectively, compared to 7 for wild-type HalA2 and 3 for
wild-type HalA1. Modification of these chimeras containing matched
leader peptides and synthetases supports the importance of leader
peptide binding. Alternatively, exposure of HalA1-A2 to HalM2 and
HalA2-A1 to HalM1 resulted in 6 and 1 dehydrations, respectively.
These results suggested that the mismatched leader peptides and enzymes
might have affinity for each other or, alternatively, that the core
peptides might also have affinity for their cognate enzymes. Fluorescence
polarization assays have confirmed both hypotheses.385 The HalA1 leader proved a competent partner for HalM2,
binding with a Kd of 4.1 μM, comparable
to that of the HalA2 leader and HalM2 (Kd = 3.7 μM). The HalA2 core peptide has low affinity for HalM2
with a Kd > 500 μM but interestingly,
a HalM2 ConFusion enzyme has much higher affinity for the core peptide
(Kd = 85 μM). This result demonstrates
for the first time synergistic binding of the leader and core peptides
and supports a mechanistic model in which binding of the leader peptide
not only favors an active enzyme conformation but facilitates core
peptide binding to enable catalysis. Notably, the dissociation constants
reflect a much lower binding affinity for HalM2 and its substrate
than has been demonstrated for two other characterized class II LanMs.
As determined by surface plasmon resonance studies, the nukacin ISK-1
synthetase NukM and its substrate NukA bind with a Kd of 60 nM353,389 and the bovicin HJ50
synthetase BovM and its substrate BovA bind with a Kd of 16.4 nM.379 The reasons
for these large differences in affinity are not yet clear. Although affinity of the leader

chimeric haloduracin precursor peptides described above were
never fully processed suggesting that the native leader peptide may
be required for proper positioning of the core peptide.385 Indeed, kinetic investigation into the processing
of LctA by LctM has revealed a role for the LctA leader peptide in
spatial positioning.375 To evaluate the
kinetic importance of the covalent linkage of leader and core peptides,
several systems were explored using LctA mutants incorporating deuterium
at dehydratable Ser and Thr residues to monitor the directionality
of dehydration (Figure 38). Wild-type LctM was shown to process deuterated LctA-T24S
with N-to-C directionality; Thr9 and Ser11 were dehydrated first followed
by Ser18 and Ser24. Notably, exposure of deuterated LctA to LctM lacking
the cyclase domain (LctMΔcyc) resulted in much slower processing
but the same directionality. Surprisingly, very different results
were obtained when the same kinetics experiments were conducted with
in trans provided LctA leader and core peptides for LctM and LctMΔcyc,
or for the LctM ConFusion enzyme with the core peptide. The rate of
both dehydration and cyclization was reduced in all three cases. Intriguingly,
the directionality of dehydration was also changed; Ser11/Thr24 was
dehydrated first, then Thr9/Ser11/Thr24, then Thr9/Thr24, and finally
Ser18. The regioselectivity of cyclization was also disrupted as analyzed
by tandem MS. Specifically, a non-native Dha11-Cys14 ring formed,
likely due to a nonenzymatic cyclization event that becomes competitive
in these less efficient systems. Thus, the leader peptide not only
increases the efficiency of catalysis through allostery, but is also
important for the correct order of dehydration presumably by proper
positioning of the core peptide. In turn the correct order prevents
incorrect nonenzymatic cyclization.375 The

I lanthipeptides described in section 2.6, many class II lanthipeptides contain
PTMs in addition to the characteristic thioether cross-links and dehydro
amino acids. These additional modifications contribute to the broad
structural diversity of lanthipeptides and also often appear to increase
their bioactivities. The presumably nonenzymatic hydrolysis of N-terminal
Dha or Dhb that occurs upon leader peptide proteolysis to afford N-terminal
2-oxopropionyl and 2-oxobutyryl groups, respectively, is seen in both
class I and II lanthipeptides (e.g., Pep5 and pinensin from class
I;276 lichenicidin, lacticin 3147, and
lactocin S from class II; Figures 5, 23, and 40).410 In addition, disulfide formation
is observed in class II and class III, with examples in class II including
haloduracin α and bovicin HJ50 (Figure 21). As these gene clusters either lack a
dedicated thiol–disulfide oxidoreductase124 or it is not required for bioactivity as shown for bovicin
HJ50,411 this tailoring modification will
not be discussed further. Other than these two modifications, tailoring
PTMs tend not to be shared between classes of lanthipeptides based
on the compounds characterized thus far. The general lack of PTM crossover
between classes could be explained by different evolutionary origins
or it may be that as more lanthipeptide gene clusters are sequenced
PTMs will emerge in class II that were already seen in other classes
and vice versa. It is only within the past few years that most of
the enzymes responsible for additional PTMs in class II have been
studied. Generally, these enzymes can be divided into two groups with
respect to their substrate selectivity, although for some the selectivity
is not fully characterized. One group is very permissive and can process
both linear and cyclic peptides. These enzymes have much potential
for bioengineering. The second group is highly selective and only
acts on cyclized peptides. Like the class

acids have been found in ribosomally synthesized natural

stability,87,417−419 structural conformation,420 and bioactivity.413,414,421 As only L-amino acids are genetically
encoded, access to the D stereochemistry requires post-translational
modification and several unique mechanisms for this transformation
have been uncovered. For nonlanthipeptide natural products, D-amino
acids are incorporated by epimerization of the corresponding L-amino
acid, either by a deprotonation-protonation mechanism422,423 or by a radical mechanism.424 When the
first lanthipeptide containing D-amino acids was identified in 1994,274 it was immediately clear that a different mechanism
must be operative. Certain serines encoded in the precursor gene for
lactocin S were not found in the natural product; instead, alanine
residues were found in their place. Incorporation of nongenetically
encoded Ala was confirmed by amino acid composition analysis, and
the D-stereochemistry of these Ala residues was shown by GC-MS analysis
with a chiral stationary phase (Figure 40). Based on the mechanism of (Me)Lan formation
in lanthipeptides, the conversion of l-serine to d-alanine was suggested to occur by initial LanM-catalyzed dehydration
of l-Ser to afford Dha.274 Instead
of lanthionine formation, diastereoselective hydrogenation of Dha
by a hypothetical enzyme (later generically named LanJ361,421,425) could then give d-Ala. D-Amino

first lanthipeptide containing D-amino acids was identified in 1994,274 it was immediately clear that a different mechanism
must be operative. Certain serines encoded in the precursor gene for
lactocin S were not found in the natural product; instead, alanine
residues were found in their place. Incorporation of nongenetically
encoded Ala was confirmed by amino acid composition analysis, and
the D-stereochemistry of these Ala residues was shown by GC-MS analysis
with a chiral stationary phase (Figure 40). Based on the mechanism of (Me)Lan formation
in lanthipeptides, the conversion of l-serine to d-alanine was suggested to occur by initial LanM-catalyzed dehydration
of l-Ser to afford Dha.274 Instead
of lanthionine formation, diastereoselective hydrogenation of Dha
by a hypothetical enzyme (later generically named LanJ361,421,425) could then give d-Ala. D-Amino
acids have been found in ribosomally synthesized natural
products of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic origin.367,412−416 This unusual stereochemistry is thought to contribute to proteolytic
stability,87,417−419 structural conformation,420 and bioactivity.413,414,421 As only L-amino acids are genetically
encoded, access to the D stereochemistry requires post-translational
modification and several unique mechanisms for this transformation
have been uncovered. For nonlanthipeptide natural products, D-amino
acids are incorporated by epimerization of the corresponding L-amino
acid, either by a deprotonation-protonation mechanism422,423 or by a radical mechanism.424 When the

structural characterization of the two-component lanthipeptide lacticin
3147, composed of Ltnα and Ltnβ and produced by L. lactis (Figure 40).426 Chiral GC-MS analysis of
the hydrolyzed peptides showed that Ltnα contains one d-Ala at residue 7426 and Ltnβ contains
two d-Ala (later shown to be residues 9 and 12).410 Subsequent studies identified the biological

of Ser followed by diastereoselective hydrogenation. Specifically,
it was shown that d-Ala was not formed in the absence of
the enzyme LtnJ.421 Ltnα and Ltnβ
produced in vivo in a ΔltnJ strain contained

equimolar ratio with wild-type Ltnβ to susceptible L.

Together with experiments showing reduced activity for mutants where d-Ala was replaced with l-Ala,421 these studies showed that the incorporation of alanine
as the D stereoisomer is important to the bioactivity of lacticin
3147. Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate Thr
at d-Ala precursor sites in the LtnA1 and LtnA2 precursor
peptides resulted in products that had undergone dehydration of Thr
to afford Dhb but not hydrogenation to afford D-Abu;421 these results suggested that LtnJ can reduce Dha but not

Genome mining for orthologs of LtnJ uncovered three other putative
dehydrogenases;421 SacJ, which is located
in the Staphylococcus aureus C55 operon for the biosynthesis
of staphylococcin C55,427 a lanthipeptide
predicted to be very similar in structure to lacticin 3147; PenN from Pediococcus pentosaceus FBB61, which is required to access
bioactive pediocin A;428 and NpnJ (originally
named NstJ),421 which is from a cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102 cluster that contains a LanM
but does not produce lanthipeptides as the precursor peptides (NpnA)
do not contain cysteines.368 LtnJ, NpnJ,
PenN, and SacJ share many conserved residues including three or four
conserved Cys residues predicted to bind zinc (NpnJ has three of the
conserved Cys, LtnJ, SacJ, and PenN have all four).429 These four enzymes have been classified as LanJA-type dehydrogenases based on their zinc and NADPH-dependence.425 The dehydrogenase activity for PenN and SacJ
was demonstrated in vivo with the lacticin 3147 substrate, confirming
their function and suggesting that these enzymes do not require a
leader peptide as a non-native substrate was accepted.429 Specifically, supplementing the ΔltnJ strain described above with penN restored d-Ala formation in both Ltnα and Ltnβ, whereas supplementation
with sacJ restored d-Ala formation in Ltnα
but not in Ltnβ. No effect was observed with npnJ, likely due to poor expression (vide infra). The activity of penN is particularly intriguing; although penN has proven necessary for accessing bioactive pediocin A428 and PenN reduced Dha in LtnA1 and LtnA2, surprisingly
the gene cluster containing PenN does not contain a LanM or LanB.

A remain unknown, thus whether or not pediocin A incorporates D-amino

were identified by in vivo expression
studies429 using the ΔltnJ strain supplemented with ltnJ mutants where 15
residues conserved among LtnJ, SacJ, PenN, and NpnJ were individually
replaced. Leu54, Gly99, Thr166, Ala189, and Leu317 were found to be
critical for LtnJ activity but Asn63, Ser89, Gly127, Ala157, Leu185,
Thr213, and Gly308 were not, as wild-type lacticin 3147 was obtained
without significant change in bioactivity. Gly272 and Asp335 were
important for efficient reduction in LtnA2. The most surprising effect
was observed with the LtnJ-K359A mutant; lacticin 3147 of the correct
mass was still produced but the bioactivity was 1.5 fold lower than
for the ΔltnJ strain and >20-fold lower
than
for wild-type lacticin 3147. Remarkably, the bioactivity is reduced
because a single mutation to Lys359 results in an enzyme that is no
longer stereoselective. For a completely diastereoselective hydrogenation,
the ratio of d-Ala to l-Ala should be 1:2 for both
Ltnα and Ltnβ (Figure 40), but mutating Lys359 resulted in ratios of 1:4.4
and 1:6.6, respectively. These studies offer intriguing insights into
how the chirality is transferred from the enzyme to the substrate.
Although the precise roles of the important LtnJ residues have not
been assigned and would be greatly facilitated by an X-ray structure,
one possible function of Lys359 is to stabilize negative charge buildup
on the carbonyl group resulting from initial hydride conjugate addition
to the Dha. The important residues in LtnJ

is highly
dependent on the substrate sequence, including the stereochemical
outcome of cyclizations as discussed in section 4.3.3. In contrast, a high degree of flexibility
has been reported for LanJA enzymes with no apparent loss
of stereoselectivity. For example, LtnJ has been used to incorporate d-Ala into nisin, once again suggesting that LtnJ does not require
a leader peptide.430,431 These studies used an in vivo
expression system in L. lactis of LtnJ, NisA, and
NisBCT, which suggests that LtnJ can act on cyclic peptides given
the coupled activity predicted for NisBC (section 2.4). Additionally, LtnJ was shown to modify
a mutant of NisA lacking all cysteines, showing that LtnJ can act
on both linear and cyclized substrates. A variety of flanking hydrophobic
residues were well accepted by LtnJ. However, flanking charged residues
including Lys and Glu as well as an adjacent Dhx were not tolerated.
Finally, with this system it was once again shown that LtnJ can reduce
Dha but not Dhb. The substrate scope of LanJA is also substantiated
by the fact that there are no remaining Dha in Ltnα, Ltnβ,
and lactocin S (Figure 40) and that all of the d-Ala are flanked by hydrophobic
residues. It is also intriguing that the three Dha that react to form
Lan in Ltnα and Ltnβ are adjacent to polar, charged, or
Dhx residues; it seems likely that LtnM completes its function first,
but it is interesting that the Dha residues involved in ring formation
are predicted to be poor substrates for LtnJ. Introduction of many PTMs in lanthipeptide biosynthesis

Lan in Ltnα and Ltnβ are adjacent to polar, charged, or
Dhx residues; it seems likely that LtnM completes its function first,
but it is interesting that the Dha residues involved in ring formation
are predicted to be poor substrates for LtnJ. The broad substrate
scope of LanJA enzymes has also
been illustrated for the activity of NpnJ in what was the first in
vitro reconstitution of a LanJ enzyme.425 In prior in vivo studies, NpnJ was not functional,429 but use of an MBP-tag provided soluble, active NpnJ. As
for LtnJ, the leader peptide was not required for activity and only
Dha could be hydrogenated, not Dhb. A variety of flanking residues
were tolerated although C-terminal charged residues greatly reduced
efficiency, and Trp and Pro were also poorly tolerated. NpnJ was also
shown to act on non-native substrates, including dehydrated LctA in
vitro and mLtnA1 and mLtnA2 in E. coli. These experiments
provided in vitro support for the substrate scope predicted from in
vivo studies on LanJAs and also inspired a straightforward
method for analyzing d-Ala incorporation. Traditionally,
this analysis is carried out either by GC-MS of the hydrolyzed peptide
or by LC-MS analysis of the hydrolyzed peptides modified by Marfey’s
reagent. However, these methods are complicated when the hydrogenation
does not go to full conversion or when the peptides also contain many
gene-encoded l-Ala residues. By carrying out the reduction
of the peptides in vitro in D2O with NpnJ and NADP2H generated in situ from NADP+ by phosphite dehydrogenase,
two 2H atoms are incorporated into every d-Ala.
Subsequent treatment with Marfey’s reagent results in d-Ala and l-Ala-bearing molecules with distinct LC retention
times and distinct masses, thus facilitating analysis.425 The broad substrate

characterized. This enzyme
class, termed LanJB,425 are
flavin-dependent oxidoreductases. Notably, although the LanJ involved
in lactocin S biosynthesis has not been characterized it is also predicted
to be a LanJB based on sequence homology425 (the protein of unknown function was originally annotated
as LasN).50 CrnJ, involved in the biosynthesis
of carnolysin, was the first of two recently explored LanJBs.361 Carnolysin is a two-component lanthipeptide
composed of CrnA1′ and CrnA2′ and interestingly it contains
both unusual ring stereochemistry (LL-Lan and LL-MeLan, see section 4.3.3) and D-amino
acids. Another unusual feature is that both d-Ala and d-Abu are incorporated, resulting from hydrogenation of Dha
and Dhb, respectively. CrnA1′ contains four d-Ala
and CrnA2′ contains one d-Ala and one d-Abu.
Coexpression in E. coli of the precursor peptides
CrnA1 or CrnA2 with CrnM in the presence or absence of CrnJ showed
that CrnJ is responsible for both Dha and Dhb hydrogenation.361 More recently, a new class of LanJs was

CrnA1 or CrnA2 with CrnM in the presence or absence of CrnJ showed
that CrnJ is responsible for both Dha and Dhb hydrogenation.361 The second of two LanJBs explored
was BsjJB,400 the enzyme responsible
for hydrogenation
in the recently discovered two-component lanthipeptide bicereucin
(Figure 37). In addition
to the D-amino acids, another unusual feature of bicereucin is that
only one component is a lanthipeptide and its lanthionine cross-link
is formed as a mixture of stereoisomers (see section 4.3.3). The activity of BsjJB was reconstituted both in a heterologous coexpression system
in E. coli and in vitro using dehydrated BsjA1 as
the substrate in the presence of FMN and NADH. As observed for CrnJ,
BsjJB reduces both Dha and Dhb. Specifically, Bsjα
contains four d-Ala while Bsjβ contains one d-Abu and three d-Ala (Figure 37). At this point it is unclear why the LanJB class of enzymes can hydrogenate both Dha and Dhb whereas
the LanJA class can only reduce Dha. The second of two LanJBs explored

the LanJA class can only reduce Dha. Although the
sequence specificity of LanJB enzymes has
not been as extensively explored by mutagenesis as for LanJA enzymes, some trends can be gleaned from the structures of carnolysin
and bicereucin. LanJA and LanJB enzymes feature
similarities in their requirements for flanking residues, which are
commonly hydrophobic and no hydrogenation occurs adjacent to Pro.
In addition, Dhx flanked by thioether cross-links are not hydrogenated
likely due to steric hindrance or possibly the presence of a D-stereocenter
in (Me)Lan. Spatial positioning of the Dhx residues may be more important
for the LanJB class than for the LanJA class,
which reduces Dha at many different positions. For instance, BsjJB does not act on Dhb33 near the C-terminus of Bsjα.
Second, when ring formation is blocked in Bsjβ by mutating Cys40
(see Figure 37 for
numbering) neither Dha35 nor Dhb39 were reduced; however, another
possible explanation is that these residues are not hydrogenated due
to flanking polar/charged residues. Although the

that there are two independent
enzyme families that convert dehydro amino acids to the corresponding
D-amino acids, we propose that for clarity and consistency the gene/protein
designation of LanJ proteins always indicate whether they are members
of the Zn2+-dependent dehydrogenase family (i.e., LtnJA, SacJA, PenJA, and NpnJA) or the flavin dependent dehydrogenase family (LasJB,

biosynthetic
gene cluster was cloned from Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus DSM 40005 and heterologously expressed in Streptomyces lividans.328 Subsequent genetic experiments identified
four out of 21 predicted open reading frames (orfs) as critical to
cinnamycin production: genes encoding the precursor peptide CinA,
the lanthionine synthetase CinM, an α-ketoglutarate/iron(II)-dependent
hydroxylase homologue CinX, and Cinorf7, for which no homologues with
assigned function had been found. The respective roles of cinM, cinX, and cinorf7 were determined by evaluating each orf individually.450 CinM and CinX functions were reconstituted
in vitro and as a coexpression system in E. coli.
As predicted by sequence homology, CinX was confirmed to be an α-ketoglutarate
(α-KG)/iron(II)-dependent hydroxylase responsible for Asp15
hydroxylation. CinX could process both linear CinA and CinM-modified
CinA and also did not require the leader peptide,450 as is common for tailoring enzymes. In groundbreaking studies on cinnamycin biosynthesis, its

hydroxylase homologue CinX, and Cinorf7, for which no homologues with
assigned function had been found. The respective roles of cinM, cinX, and cinorf7 were determined by evaluating each orf individually.450 CinM and CinX functions were reconstituted
in vitro and as a coexpression system in E. coli.
As predicted by sequence homology, CinX was confirmed to be an α-ketoglutarate
(α-KG)/iron(II)-dependent hydroxylase responsible for Asp15
hydroxylation. CinX could process both linear CinA and CinM-modified
CinA and also did not require the leader peptide,450 as is common for tailoring enzymes. In groundbreaking studies on cinnamycin biosynthesis, its
biosynthetic
gene cluster was cloned from Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus DSM 40005 and heterologously expressed in Streptomyces lividans.328 Subsequent genetic experiments identified

to dehydrate all Ser/Thr in the CinA core peptide,
including the Ser involved in Lal formation (Ser6), thus suggesting
that Lal formation results from Lys attack on Dha (Figure 41).450 However, CinM does not catalyze Lys attack, serving only to catalyze
Cys conjugate addition that results in the three (Me)Lan. Instead,
Cinorf7 was found to promote Lal formation when coexpressed with CinAMX
in E. coli. Unfortunately, the activity of Cinorf7,
a small protein of just 13 kDa, could not been reconstituted in vitro;
alternatively, exposure of CinM and CinX-modified CinA to pH 9.5 in
vitro resulted in nonenzymatic cyclization to afford Lal. The stereoselectivity
of this cyclization was not confirmed due to complicating epimerization
of Lal groups upon the peptide hydrolysis necessary for chiral GC-MS
analysis. However, the substrate-controlled stereoselectivity observed
in (Me)Lan formation (section 4.3.3) suggests that nonenzymatic Lys attack to form Lal
may give the native LL-cross-link, especially given the very compact
and well-ordered structure of the final product, which may not allow
formation of the DL-Lal isomer.443 CinM was shown

and IV Lanthipeptide Biosynthesis Class III
and IV Lanthipeptide Biosynthesis Discovery
of Class III and IV Pathways Discovery
of Class III and IV Pathways Discovery
of Class III and IV Pathways The two most recently discovered
classes of lanthipeptides have a
common mechanism of dehydration that is distinct from class I and
II, but they differ in their cyclization strategies. Because their
shared dehydration reactions are much better understood than the cyclization
processes, these classes will be discussed together in this review.
Class III lanthipeptides were first established when Willey and co-workers
reported that the small morphogenetic peptide SapB was a lanthipeptide.6 SapB was known to be important for formation
of the aerial mycelium at the start of the sporulation process of Streptomyces coelicolor.(471) Its
structure had been unknown, but genetic studies had identified the
locus for rapid aerial mycelium (ram) formation.472,473 This gene cluster had no similarities with known lanthipeptide gene
clusters, but it did encode a 42-amino acid peptide (RamS) as well
as a protein RamC with homology to Ser/Thr protein kinases.474 A similar cluster (aerial mycelium formation, amf) was found in Streptomyces griseus and
encodes the AmfS peptide.475,476 A sequence analysis
of RamC suggested that the protein, in addition to a Ser/Thr protein
kinase domain, contained a C-terminal domain with homology to the
C-terminal cyclization domain of the class II lanthipeptide synthetases
CinM and MrsM that are involved in the biosynthesis of cinnamycin
and mersacidin, respectively.6 Even though
RamC lacks the catalytic residues and Zn2+-binding residues
that are conserved in the cyclase domains of LanM and in LanC proteins
(sections 4.3.1 and 2.3, respectively), the authors showed
that the mass of SapB was consistent with the C-terminal 21 residues
of RamS after four dehydrations.6 Chemical
derivatization studies followed by mass spectrometry, Edman degradation,
and amino acid analyses provided strong evidence for the structure
shown in Figure 43. A decade later, analysis of the available Actinobacteria genomes
showed that the ram/amf-like gene clusters are the
most common lanthipeptide gene cluster family in this phylum.35 Another morphogenetic peptide, SapT, is also
involved in aerial mycelium formation in Streptomyces tendae and was also shown to be a lanthipeptide.7 Whereas SapB was too hydrophobic to obtain an NMR structure because
of aggregation, SapT was amenable to NMR structure elucidation (Figure 44A).7 Although the gene cluster encoding SapT has not yet been
reported, a BLAST search performed for this review with its putative
precursor core peptide sequence returns a 50-amino acid peptide in Streptomyces reticuli (GenBank accession number CUW32634.1)
with a potential core peptide that differs in just two residues (Figure 44B). Interestingly,
immediately adjacent to the putative substrate gene is a lanB gene. The contig does not provide additional information, but another
56-amino acid peptide from Streptomyces albulus CCRC11814
(GenBank accession number EPY92828.1) differs in nine residues from
SapT in its putative core region and is predicted to contain the same
4-ring topology of SapT but also to have a fifth ring at its C-terminus
(Figure 44B). Similarly,
this gene is flanked by a lanB gene, but the cluster
also clearly contains genes for a LanC and a standalone LanB C_terminal
domain protein (Pfam 14028; homologous to LanB glutamate elimination
domain, section 2.2), with the function of the latter unclear. Thus, it is very likely
that these gene clusters encode class I lanthipeptides and that SapT
also belongs in this class and not class III as previously assigned
based on bioactivity.54 The two most recently discovered
classes of lanthipeptides have a
common mechanism of dehydration that is distinct from class I and
II, but they differ in their cyclization strategies. Because their
shared dehydration reactions are much better understood than the cyclization

involved in aerial mycelium formation in Streptomyces tendae and was also shown to be a lanthipeptide.7 Whereas SapB was too hydrophobic to obtain an NMR structure because
of aggregation, SapT was amenable to NMR structure elucidation (Figure 44A).7 Although the gene cluster encoding SapT has not yet been
reported, a BLAST search performed for this review with its putative
precursor core peptide sequence returns a 50-amino acid peptide in Streptomyces reticuli (GenBank accession number CUW32634.1)
with a potential core peptide that differs in just two residues (Figure 44B). Interestingly,
immediately adjacent to the putative substrate gene is a lanB gene. The contig does not provide additional information, but another
56-amino acid peptide from Streptomyces albulus CCRC11814
(GenBank accession number EPY92828.1) differs in nine residues from
SapT in its putative core region and is predicted to contain the same
4-ring topology of SapT but also to have a fifth ring at its C-terminus
(Figure 44B). Similarly,
this gene is flanked by a lanB gene, but the cluster
also clearly contains genes for a LanC and a standalone LanB C_terminal
domain protein (Pfam 14028; homologous to LanB glutamate elimination
domain, section 2.2), with the function of the latter unclear. Thus, it is very likely
that these gene clusters encode class I lanthipeptides and that SapT
also belongs in this class and not class III as previously assigned
based on bioactivity.54 The two most recently discovered
classes of lanthipeptides have a
common mechanism of dehydration that is distinct from class I and
II, but they differ in their cyclization strategies. Because their
shared dehydration reactions are much better understood than the cyclization
processes, these classes will be discussed together in this review.
Class III lanthipeptides were first established when Willey and co-workers
reported that the small morphogenetic peptide SapB was a lanthipeptide.6 SapB was known to be important for formation
of the aerial mycelium at the start of the sporulation process of Streptomyces coelicolor.(471) Its
structure had been unknown, but genetic studies had identified the
locus for rapid aerial mycelium (ram) formation.472,473 This gene cluster had no similarities with known lanthipeptide gene
clusters, but it did encode a 42-amino acid peptide (RamS) as well
as a protein RamC with homology to Ser/Thr protein kinases.474 A similar cluster (aerial mycelium formation, amf) was found in Streptomyces griseus and
encodes the AmfS peptide.475,476 A sequence analysis
of RamC suggested that the protein, in addition to a Ser/Thr protein
kinase domain, contained a C-terminal domain with homology to the
C-terminal cyclization domain of the class II lanthipeptide synthetases
CinM and MrsM that are involved in the biosynthesis of cinnamycin
and mersacidin, respectively.6 Even though
RamC lacks the catalytic residues and Zn2+-binding residues
that are conserved in the cyclase domains of LanM and in LanC proteins
(sections 4.3.1 and 2.3, respectively), the authors showed
that the mass of SapB was consistent with the C-terminal 21 residues
of RamS after four dehydrations.6 Chemical
derivatization studies followed by mass spectrometry, Edman degradation,
and amino acid analyses provided strong evidence for the structure
shown in Figure 43. A decade later, analysis of the available Actinobacteria genomes
showed that the ram/amf-like gene clusters are the
most common lanthipeptide gene cluster family in this phylum.35 Another morphogenetic peptide, SapT, is also
involved in aerial mycelium formation in Streptomyces tendae and was also shown to be a lanthipeptide.7 Whereas SapB was too hydrophobic to obtain an NMR structure because
of aggregation, SapT was amenable to NMR structure elucidation (Figure 44A).7 Although the gene cluster encoding SapT has not yet been

also belongs in this class and not class III as previously assigned
based on bioactivity.54 Figure 43Biosynthesis of SapB.

that SapB was a lanthipeptide
and that there was a third biosynthetic pathway to this family of
RiPPs, two studies in 2010 provided key new information on this pathway.
The first study reported the structure of the labyrinthopeptins and
the associated gene cluster.10 Structure
elucidation of a series of congeners of these compounds had proven
unusually challenging, hence their name, and only when a crystal structure
of one of them was obtained did it become clear why: the compound
contains two entirely unprecedented and unanticipated cross-links
in which new carbon–carbon bonds are made between the α-carbon
of what used to be a Ser and the β-carbon of what used to be
another Ser (Figures 1 and 45A).10 This
new type of cross-link was termed labionin. The presumed mechanism
of its formation involves initial attack of a Cys thiol onto a Dha.
Instead of protonation of the resulting enolate to form a lanthionine,
another conjugate addition is thought to take place in which the enolate
attacks a different Dha to form a second enolate, which upon protonation
forms the labionin (Figure 2).10 The gene cluster that encodes
for labyrinthopeptins showed the presence of a protein that has clear
homology with RamC comprising a kinase domain and a C-terminal cyclase
domain. In vitro studies confirmed that this protein carries out both
dehydration and labionin formation.477 These
studies also observed phosphorylated intermediates that demonstrated
that the Ser/Thr kinase domain indeed carries out the presumed reaction
and resulted in the designation LanKC for this class of proteins (for
lanthipeptide kinase and cyclase). As noted above, the C-terminal
domain of RamC/LanKC shows sequence homology with LanC enzymes and
the C-termini of LanM proteins but lacks the catalytic residues and
zinc-binding ligands of the latter two protein families (Figure 46).477 A few years after the recognition

study reported in 2010 provided additional
insights into RamC/LanKC catalysis.128 Genome
mining of Actinobacteria uncovered examples of proteins with a C-terminal
LanC-like domain (this time including the zinc ligands and catalytic
residues), a central Ser/Thr kinase domain, and an N-terminal domain
that resembled type III effector proteins of Gram-negative pathogens
including Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Shigella (Figure 46). These effector proteins
recognize a phosphorylated Thr on the activation loop of mitogen activated
protein kinases (MAPK) and eliminate the phosphate to inactivate these
proteins that are a key part of the immune response.478−481 In vitro studies with the putative lanthipeptide biosynthetic protein
discovered in Streptomyces venezuelae showed that
it indeed catalyzed three independent reactions (phosphorylation,
phosphate elimination, and cyclization) on its substrate peptide (VenA)
as discussed in the next section.128 Homologous
phospholyase domains that presumably also catalyze phosphate elimination
were also detected at the N-termini of the RamC/LanKC family (Figure 46).128 However, the clear differences in the cyclization
domains required separation of the enzymes into two classes of lanthipeptide

the biological activities of class III lanthipeptides
are very diverse and many do not display antimicrobial activities
against the organisms tested. As a result, following the lead of the
prototypical labyrinthopeptin, class III peptides have been designated
with the suffix–peptin,1,132 rather than the often
used suffix -cin or -cidin, which implies a toxic activity. Based
on the currently available genomes, class III lanthipeptide gene clusters
significantly outnumber class IV clusters.35 To date, all class IV lanthipeptides are close analogs of the original

RamC was the first discovered class III lanthipeptide synthetase,
the extreme insolubility of its substrate RamS precluded any in vitro
studies. LabKC, the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the
labyrinthopeptins, could be studied in vitro and was shown to convert
synthetic LabA2 into mLabA2 (Figure 45B), confirming that the enzyme catalyzes both dehydration
and cyclization, despite the absence of zinc-ligands.477 Metal analysis of the AciKC ortholog involved
in catenulipeptin biosynthesis (Figure 48) corroborated that the protein did not
bind zinc nor any other metal.130 The in

the requirement of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) or deoxy-GTP for dehydration
instead of ATP that is utilized by class II LanM enzymes.477 Subsequent studies on a series of LanKC enzymes

or TTP as a cosubstrate,130 and StaKC484 and CurKC131 responsible

all NTPs/dNTPs but prefer purine nucleoside triphosphates as the phosphoryl
donor for the central kinase domain (for structures of these class

RamC was the first discovered class III lanthipeptide synthetase,
the extreme insolubility of its substrate RamS precluded any in vitro
studies. LabKC, the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the
labyrinthopeptins, could be studied in vitro and was shown to convert
synthetic LabA2 into mLabA2 (Figure 45B), confirming that the enzyme catalyzes both dehydration
and cyclization, despite the absence of zinc-ligands.477 Metal analysis of the AciKC ortholog involved

bind zinc nor any other metal.130 The in

for two enzymes,
LabKC and CurKC, using the Ser/Thr deuterium-labeling strategy described
in section 4.4 but
that was originally developed for studies on LabKC (Figure 38).401 Both enzymes are distributive, and unlike class II lanthipeptide
synthetases, phosphorylated intermediates are detected with wild-type
substrates. LabKC and CurKC catalyze dehydration with net C-to-N terminal
directionality.247,401 Although both enzymes clearly
display overall directionality, the differentiation between two consecutively
dehydrated residues is not always complete and hence several parallel
pathways are operational,247,401 similar to what is
observed for class I and class II dehydration.245,364,365,375 Thus, it may be that the model of conformational sampling discussed
in section 4.4 is
a general feature of dehydration in all three enzyme classes; the
order and directionality for class IV LanL enzymes has thus far not
been investigated. The order of dehydration has been investigated

order and directionality for class IV LanL enzymes has thus far not

involves two separate
active sites with phosphorylation taking place in the central kinase
domain and phosphate elimination in the N-terminal pSer/pThr lyase
domain. The timing of these two processes has been most extensively
investigated for CurKC. Surprisingly, phosphorylation and elimination
are not always consecutive reactions. During processing of CurA by
CurKC, an initially phosphorylated Ser1 remains phosphorylated as
the enzyme dehydrates Ser12 and Ser15, leading to bisphosphorylated
intermediates (Figure 49).247 Only after
Ser12 and Ser15 have been converted into Dha is the phosphate at pSer1
eliminated, and it appears that only then is cyclization initiated.
Interestingly, when Ser1 was mutated to Ala, Ser2 was phosphorylated
first.247 Thus, it appears that leader
peptide binding juxtaposes the core peptide in such a way with respect
to the kinase active site that a residue at its N-terminus is the
preferred substrate for the first phosphorylation. However, in the
ensuing competition between the lyase and kinase domain to either
eliminate the phosphate from pSer1 or phosphorylate a second time
at Ser12/15, the kinase wins out possibly because pSer1 is a particularly
unfavorable substrate for the lyase domain. After Dha12/15 are both
installed, a new competition is set up between elimination at pSer1
and phosphorylation at Ser4, which apparently now favors the lyase
reaction. Interestingly, it is proposed that immediately after introduction
of the Dha1, the cyclase domain catalyzes Lan formation between Cys19
and Dha12.247 Thus, it appears that the
phosphate at Ser1 prevented cyclization. Once the Lan is introduced,
Ser4 and subsequently Ser2 become improved substrates of the kinase.
For all lanthipeptide synthetases, such models can likely only be
tested with cocrystal structures of enzymes bound to intermediates
and/or by kinetic studies with (semi)synthetic intermediates of defined
structures. Given the size of the substrates and the complexity of
the overall process, both of these approaches are highly challenging. As noted above, the dehydration reaction

VenL containing only the lyase and kinase domains,
termed VenL-Δcyc, was able to fully dehydrate the VenA substrate,
illustrating that cyclization is not required for full dehydration.128 However, this finding does not rule out a mechanism
whereby full length VenL processes VenA by alternating dehydration
and cyclization events, as has been observed for several lanthipeptide
synthetases. Expression and purification of the individual kinase
and lyase domains of VenL and incubation of these proteins with VenA
resulted in incomplete conversion, indicating that the domains can
operate separately, albeit less efficiently than when present in one
polypeptide.128 Whether the decreased efficiency
signifies some level of communication between the kinase and lyase
domains, for instance by sharing a leader peptide binding site, or
whether it simply results from less well-folded proteins, is currently
not known. Indeed, many questions remain that in principle can be
investigated such as whether or not the leader peptide is required

type III effector protein from Salmonella, Lys136
is responsible for deprotonation at the α-carbon of
the pThr targeted for phosphate elimination (Figure 50),480 and accordingly
mutation of the corresponding Lys80 in VenL resulted in phosphorylated
VenA products, indicating interference with the elimination step.485 His106 in SpvC is thought to act as the catalytic
acid that protonates the bridging oxygen in the phosphate leaving
group, and indeed mutation of the corresponding His53 in VenL interfered
with phosphate elimination. A third critical residue in SpvC, Lys104,
is thought to decrease the pKa of the
α-proton of the pThr residue by electrostatic activation of
its carbonyl group.481 The corresponding
residue in VenL, Lys51, was also shown to be important for phosphate
elimination. However, two other residues that are fully conserved
in OspF, LanL, and RamC/LanKC family members,485 Thr106 and Tyr108 in VenL (Thr156 and Tyr158 in SpvC),
were not critical for VenL catalyzed dehydration of its VenA substrate.485 Also different are the interactions with the
nonbridging phosphate oxygens. In SpvC, three Arg residues (Arg213,
Arg220, and Arg148) stabilize the negatively charged phosphate group.
A homology model predicts that in VenL these roles may be fulfilled
by residues that are not conserved in the OspF family but are in the
LanL/LanKC families: Arg156 and Lys103. A possible model for the elimination
reaction in VenL is shown in Figure 51.485 In SpvC, a

with phosphate elimination. A third critical residue in SpvC, Lys104,
is thought to decrease the pKa of the
α-proton of the pThr residue by electrostatic activation of
its carbonyl group.481 The corresponding
residue in VenL, Lys51, was also shown to be important for phosphate
elimination. However, two other residues that are fully conserved
in OspF, LanL, and RamC/LanKC family members,485 Thr106 and Tyr108 in VenL (Thr156 and Tyr158 in SpvC),
were not critical for VenL catalyzed dehydration of its VenA substrate.485 Also different are the interactions with the
nonbridging phosphate oxygens. In SpvC, three Arg residues (Arg213,
Arg220, and Arg148) stabilize the negatively charged phosphate group.
A homology model predicts that in VenL these roles may be fulfilled
by residues that are not conserved in the OspF family but are in the
LanL/LanKC families: Arg156 and Lys103. A possible model for the elimination
reaction in VenL is shown in Figure 51.485 In SpvC, a
type III effector protein from Salmonella, Lys136
is responsible for deprotonation at the α-carbon of
the pThr targeted for phosphate elimination (Figure 50),480 and accordingly
mutation of the corresponding Lys80 in VenL resulted in phosphorylated
VenA products, indicating interference with the elimination step.485 His106 in SpvC is thought to act as the catalytic
acid that protonates the bridging oxygen in the phosphate leaving
group, and indeed mutation of the corresponding His53 in VenL interfered
with phosphate elimination. A third critical residue in SpvC, Lys104,

aspect of class III lanthipeptides is that they can contain either
lanthionine or labionin residues. Comparison of the core peptide sequences
of RamS (leading to SapB) and LabA2 (leading to labyrinthopeptin A2)
demonstrates very similar SX2SX3C motifs but
one leads to lanthionine and one to labionin (Figure 52). Phylogenetic analysis of class III enzymes
that make Lan or Lab did not provide any clear indications that could
be predictive of the outcome.36 Even more
interestingly, some LanKC enzymes such as EryKC132 and StaKC484 can form both Lan
and Lab in the same product (e.g., Figure 48 for the product of EryKC). Although the
molecular mechanism of how the enzymes achieve the remarkable tandem
cross-linking reaction resulting in labionin is still mostly unclear,
several insightful observations have been reported. It is notable
that whereas some of the enzymes appear to have strong preference
to turn a given substrate sequence into either Lab or Lan, the selectivity
is not complete since small amounts of Lab have been detected by GC-MS

to GC-MS analysis, which can detect small amounts of minor products,

peptide.
Of these, the carbacyclic ring is N-terminal and the thioether ring
is C-terminal. A common nomenclature labels these two rings as A and
A′, respectively, if they are the first Lab, B and B′
if they are the second Lab, etc. (e.g., Figure 52 for labyrinthopeptin A2). Whereas the majority
of Lab structures in the currently characterized class III lanthipeptides
are formed from a SX2SX3C motif, other sequences
have also been shown to result in Lab formation. Labyrinthopeptins
A1 and A3 contain a C-terminal labionin formed from an SX2SX5C sequence that has a larger thioether ring made up
of seven residues (Figure 48),10 and the C-terminal labionin
in catenulipeptin contains a smaller thioether ring formed from an
SX2SX2C sequence (Figure 48).130 Variations
in the ring size are not limited to the C-terminal ring; the N-terminal
Lab residue in NAI-112 incorporates a six-residue thioether ring generated
from an SX2SX4C motif (Figure 48).9 Indeed, in
vivo and in vitro engineering studies have also demonstrated the ability
of LabKC to generate thioether rings with expanded or contracted rings.488 Conversely, the carbacyclic ring in (Me)Lab
appears more restricted since all such rings reported thus far in
natural products consist of four residues, and attempts to increase
or decrease this size by engineering were not successful.488 Similarly, it has been challenging to change
a Lab into a Lan,488 suggesting that the
conformation of the substrate peptide and the active site geometry
of the enzymes appear to be quite specific for one product or the
other for a given precursor peptide. An intriguing group of LanKCs
were recently found by genome mining that have putative precursor
peptides that do not contain the canonical labionin motif but that
do contain a conserved CXSX2S motif. Whether this motif
also encodes a labionin structure formed in the opposite direction
(Dha residues localized C-terminal to the Cys) remains to be determined.35 The discussion below focuses on two Lab-forming

discussed in section 5.2.1, the cyclization appears to take place with C-to-N directionality
based on mutagenesis studies. Mutation of serines that prevent formation
of C-terminal rings, whether Lab in catenulipeptin,130 Lan in curvopeptin,247 or either
Lab or Lan in stackepeptin,484 negatively
affected ring formation involving N-terminal residues. The timing
of cyclization has also been determined by tandem MS analysis of intermediates
formed during the biosynthesis of curvopeptin by CurKC, with the results
again pointing at C-to-N directionality of cyclization.247 Formation of the C-terminal Lan in curvopeptin
appears to take place only after dehydration of Ser1, Ser12, and Ser15
(Figure 49). This
means that the dehydro amino acids required for labionin installation
are available, but yet the enzyme preferentially forms a Lan. The
N-terminal Lan is proposed to be generated only after completion of
dehydration, including introduction of Dha2, and it has been suggested
that this order of events may facilitate proper positioning of the
intermediate peptide for formation of the Lan A-ring in curvopeptin.247 A strict requirement of the leader peptide
for the cyclization reaction has been determined for AciKC,130 and hence leader peptide binding and the resulting
juxtaposition with respect to the cyclase active site may also be
important for the observed order and specificity of cyclization. Whether
the leader peptide utilizes a single binding site or whether all three
domains have their own individual binding sites is currently unknown.
Sequence comparison does not locate a winged helix-turn-helix domain
like that found in LanB in either LanKC or LanL. Another intriguing
and currently unresolved question is what the functional significance
is of a clade of class IV enzymes that have a zinc site with a Cys-Cys-Cys
ligand set.36 As discussed in section 4.3, this ligand

of class IV lanthipeptides
has been determined to be the canonical DL,35 but for class III lanthipeptides stereochemistry has not yet been
explored in much detail. The stereochemistry of the founding member
of labionin-containing peptides, labyrinthopeptin A2, was firmly established
by X-ray crystallography.10 However, the
stereochemistry of the MeLab present in NAI-112 (Figure 48) is currently unknown.9 Similarly, the stereochemistry of Lab in many
other family members is inferred and has not been experimentally demonstrated.
Given the unexpected findings of noncanonical stereochemistry in class
II lanthipeptides that turned out to be sequence-dependent,38 it could be that the stereochemistry of labionin
formed from sequences other than the SX2SX3C
motif in labyrinthopeptin A2 is also different. A GC-MS method has
been developed that can detect labionins,489 but the use of this method to confirm the stereochemistry of other
labionin-containing lanthipeptides has not yet been reported. Unambiguous
determination of stereochemistry would require synthesis of all four
diastereomers of Lab, as was done for Lan and MeLan,490 or alternatively use of the diastereomers of α-methyl-2,4-diaminoglutaric
acid, the product formed upon application of a desulfurization protocol

II lanthipeptides that turned out to be sequence-dependent,38 it could be that the stereochemistry of labionin
formed from sequences other than the SX2SX3C
motif in labyrinthopeptin A2 is also different. A GC-MS method has
been developed that can detect labionins,489 but the use of this method to confirm the stereochemistry of other
labionin-containing lanthipeptides has not yet been reported. Unambiguous
determination of stereochemistry would require synthesis of all four
diastereomers of Lab, as was done for Lan and MeLan,490 or alternatively use of the diastereomers of α-methyl-2,4-diaminoglutaric
acid, the product formed upon application of a desulfurization protocol
with NiCl2/NaBH4 to labionin-containing peptides.489 The stereochemistry of the venezuelin family
of class IV lanthipeptides
has been determined to be the canonical DL,35 but for class III lanthipeptides stereochemistry has not yet been
explored in much detail. The stereochemistry of the founding member
of labionin-containing peptides, labyrinthopeptin A2, was firmly established
by X-ray crystallography.10 However, the
stereochemistry of the MeLab present in NAI-112 (Figure 48) is currently unknown.9 Similarly, the stereochemistry of Lab in many
other family members is inferred and has not been experimentally demonstrated.

formed in class
III lanthipeptides has not been reported. We note that the L stereochemistry
at carbon 2 of labionin requires protonation of the enolate from the
opposite face of the canonical protonation at carbon 2 in DL-Lan (as
seen in Figure 2).
Although the stereochemical nomenclature is S in
both cases, the actual stereochemistry is different because of the
change in Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities upon sulfur substitution at
the β-carbon of Lan compared to carbon substitution in Lab.
If protonation occurs from the same face during formation of both
Lab and Lan, then SapB and other lanthionine-containing class III
lanthipeptides would form LL-Lan. Conversely, it is possible that
the enzyme presents different faces of the enolate to the active site
acid for protonation during Lab or Lan formation. This would be analogous
to the different faces of protonation induced by a Dhx-Dhx-Xxx-Xxx-Cys
motif discussed for class II lanthipeptide synthetases in section 4.3.3. Similarly, the stereochemistry of lanthionines

of the substrate peptides that are important for biosynthesis of class
III and IV lanthipeptides have been most extensively investigated
for labyrinthopeptin A2.271,488 Truncation experiments
on the LabA2 precursor peptide showed that the LabKC enzyme requires
its leader peptide. Addition of the leader peptide in trans did not
result in any activity.271 Systematic truncation
of residues at the N- or C-terminus of the leader peptide as well
as site-specific mutagenesis showed that the first three amino acids
of the leader peptide are dispensable, but that a subsequent I-L-E-L-Q
motif is very important. Substitution of individual amino acids suggested
that the second and fourth residues in this five-amino acid motif
(both Leu) may be most important, whereas the Glu and Gln could be
replaced with Ala without losing processing by LabKC. Truncations
and replacement of residues at the C-terminus of the leader peptide
showed that residues located C-terminal to the above-mentioned motif
are not important for catalysis but are critical to position Ser/Thr
residues that are destined for dehydration at a sufficient distance
from the leader peptide binding region. If a Ser/Thr is too close
to the binding site, it is not dehydrated.271 This observation is very similar to that in class I and class II
lanthipeptide synthetases,194,251,269 and in those proteins likely reflects the distance from the leader
peptide binding site on the protein to the phosphorylation/glutamylation
active sites. Interestingly, when the RamS leader peptide was fused
to the N-terminus of a truncated LabA2 core peptide, LabKC catalyzed
dehydration of both Ser residues albeit more slowly than with the
wild type leader peptide.271 Indeed, the
leader peptide of RamS contains an LFDLQ motif at its N-terminus that
is similar to the ILELQ motif of LabA2, and this motif is widely found
in class III precursor peptides (Figure 53). Hence, leader peptide recognition may
be a conserved feature. Whether cyclization of the RamS-LabA2 hybrid
also led to labionin formation (as in labyrinthopeptin), or resulted
in lanthionine generation (as in SapB), was not reported and constitutes
an interesting question. The features

the
leader peptide or when the leader peptide was presented in trans,
the StaKC enzyme involved in stackepeptin biosynthesis did show a
low level basal activity on its core peptide, and the activity was
enhanced by addition of the leader peptide in trans.484 Thus, it may be that the leader peptide also functions
as an allosteric activator as in many other RiPP biosynthetic enzymes.150 Like the substrates for class I and II lanthipeptides,257 and those for cyanobactins491 and microcin B17492 (two other
RiPP families), the LabA2 leader peptide has a propensity to form
an α-helical secondary structure.271 However, for class I lanthipeptides, cyanobactins, and microcin
B17-like RiPPs, it has been shown that, despite their propensity to
form helices, the leader peptides bind to a conserved domain in an

of the leader peptide of class III and IV lanthipeptides is quite
different from that of class I/II compounds. First, most clusters
lack a gene encoding a dedicated protease. Second, for many family
members, a series of congeners have been observed that contain differing
numbers of amino acids originating from the leader peptide at their
N-termini. This observation was first made for the labyrinthopeptins;
the A1 and A3 congeners differ only in that A3 contains an additional
Asp at its N-terminus (Figure 48).10 Subsequently, similar
observations have been made for erythreapeptin (five congeners with
different numbers of remaining leader peptide residues), avermipeptin
(seven congeners), griseopeptin (two congeners), curvopeptin (five
congeners), stackepeptin (two congeners), and even SapB (two congeners).131,132,484 Similar observations have been
made for the class IV compounds venezuelin35 and streptocollin134 for which two variants
of each were observed. Thus, it appears that the class III and IV
lanthipeptides are generated by stepwise trimming of the leader peptides
by currently unidentified amino peptidases. It is possible that for
some or all members, an N-terminal segment of the leader peptide is
first removed in one step by a specific endopeptidase. Indeed, this
scenario has been experimentally demonstrated for flavipeptin from Kribbella flavida. Its biosynthetic gene cluster contains
a prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) designated FlaP (note that it is not
a member of the LanP Ser proteases of the subtilisin family) that
is predicted to be cytoplasmic.493 In vitro
reconstitution of FlaP activity showed that the enzyme is specific
for cyclized FlaA. The enzyme cleaves mFlaA after Pro−12 but
did not act on linear FlaA or the leader peptide, and very slowly
processed dehydrated FlaA. Hence, the rings are important for substrate
recognition. POPs were shown to be encoded in a small subset of class
III gene clusters,493 but quite a few class
III LanA substrates have Pro in their leader peptides, and hence cleavage
by a POP and subsequent trimming by aminopeptidases could be a more
general pathway. A POP has also been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis
of the RiPP class of amanitins produced by mushrooms.494 Rather than the POP encoded in the flavipeptin
biosynthetic gene cluster, a different type of protease appears to
be encoded in the cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of NAI-112
(Figure 48).9 Thus far, the activity of this protein has not

and Glycosylation Class III and IV lanthipeptides are not
as richly decorated with PTMs resulting from tailoring reactions as

been reported thus far. The prototype class III lanthipeptide labyrinthopeptin
A2 contains a disulfide linkage made by Cys9 and Cys18 that spans
the C-terminal labionin (Figure 45), and labyrinthopeptin A1/A3 contain a similarly positioned

disulfide containing class II lanthipeptides such as haloduracin α
and bovicin HJ50,124,411 the gene cluster encoding the
labyrinthopeptins does not appear to contain a disulfide isomerase
that is required for disulfide formation.10 A second tailoring PTM was discovered in NAI-112 produced by Actinoplanes DSM 24059. This compound, which also contains
the first example of a MeLab, is unusual in that it is the first example
of a glycosylated lanthipeptide (Figure 48).9 Furthermore,
the glycosylation is unusual as a 6-deoxyhexose is attached to the
indole nitrogen of Trp. At present the identity of the 6-deoxyhexose
is not known. Interestingly, a putative glycosyltransferase is encoded
within the gene cluster just downstream of the lanA gene. Class III and IV lanthipeptides are not

the first example of a MeLab, is unusual in that it is the first example
of a glycosylated lanthipeptide (Figure 48).9 Furthermore,
the glycosylation is unusual as a 6-deoxyhexose is attached to the
indole nitrogen of Trp. At present the identity of the 6-deoxyhexose
is not known. Interestingly, a putative glycosyltransferase is encoded
within the gene cluster just downstream of the lanA gene. Class III and IV lanthipeptides are not
as richly decorated with PTMs resulting from tailoring reactions as
class I and II lanthipeptides. Only two types of modification have
been reported thus far. The prototype class III lanthipeptide labyrinthopeptin
A2 contains a disulfide linkage made by Cys9 and Cys18 that spans
the C-terminal labionin (Figure 45), and labyrinthopeptin A1/A3 contain a similarly positioned
disulfide formed from Cys9 and Cys20 (Figure 48).10 Like other
disulfide containing class II lanthipeptides such as haloduracin α
and bovicin HJ50,124,411 the gene cluster encoding the
labyrinthopeptins does not appear to contain a disulfide isomerase

widely distributed, and based on the number of lanthipeptide gene
clusters, this family is currently the most abundant of all RiPPs.
The origin of this widespread occurrence may lie in the ease by which
lanthipeptides are fashioned from a linear peptide. Both the dehydration
of Ser/Thr and the conjugate addition of thiol nucleophiles to dehydro
amino acids are chemically relatively straightforward reactions to
turn a linear peptide into a polycyclic, conformationally constrained
peptide. Cyclization offers important evolutionary advantages of higher
stability87,176,178,495,496 and improved target recognition.468,497 The notion
that at least four different routes to lanthipeptides have evolved
may be a further demonstration of both the ease of evolution of these
pathways, and the privileged nature of the thioether cross-link to
access biological activity space. As discussed in this review, lanthipeptide biosynthesis is very

pathways, and the privileged nature of the thioether cross-link to
access biological activity space. At least three very different
solutions have evolved for the dehydration
step. Glutamylation in class I lanthipeptides is entirely novel and
the evolutionary origins are at present still enigmatic. Classes II–IV
all involve Ser/Thr activation via phosphorylation by a kinase-like
protein followed by phosphate elimination, but different solutions
have evolved for the latter step. For class II lanthipeptides, the
elimination activity evolved out of the kinase active site, whereas
for class III and IV a separate standalone elimination domain was
recruited. It is possible that there are other dehydration mechanisms
that remain to be discovered for which the associated biosynthetic
gene clusters have not yet been recognized as lanthipeptide gene clusters.
Indeed, most genome mining efforts in the lanthipeptides field have
used knowledge of existing biosynthetic strategies as queries, which
would only return members of known classes. Even when limiting genome
mining efforts to the four known classes of lanthipeptides, the amount
of diversity and biosynthetic novelty remaining to be discovered is
staggering. For instance, an analysis of 830 actinobacterial genomes
illustrated that known lanthipeptides from this phylum cover only
a very small fraction of biosynthetic space.35 Many gene cluster families that are quite common in these genomes
at present do not have a member with a characterized structure of
the final product, and many clusters contain putative biosynthetic
enzymes for which the function currently is unclear, such as radical-SAM
proteins and methyltransferases.35,37 It is also
noteworthy that the utilization of the lanthipeptide biosynthetic
enzymes, or domains thereof, is also observed in other classes of
RiPPs, such as thiopeptides202 and proteusins,367 and RiPPs that are formed from precursor peptides
lacking Cys,368 and they are even found
in gene clusters for natural products that are not RiPPs such as NRPS
and PKS clusters.35 At least three very different

of ways by which dehydration is achieved, remarkable
similarities have started to emerge with respect to the role of the
leader peptide and the determination of ring topology. In three of
the four classes, a low basal level of dehydration activity has been
observed in the absence of a leader peptide, and addition of the leader
peptide in trans has increased this activity. These observations are
consistent with a model in which the leader peptide functions as an
allosteric activator.150 Another similarity
is the existence of multiple parallel modification pathways in an
overall ordered process, suggesting that the energy differences governing
site selectivity can be small for residues that are close in space.
A third commonality is the observation that dehydration and cyclization
are often coupled, such that a later dehydration may require a prior
cyclization. This is not observed for all systems, however, since
in all classes there are some dehydratases or dehydration domains
that can complete dehydration of all targeted sites even when no cyclization
has occurred (e.g., NisB,243 ProcM,246,365 NukM,498 and CurKC131). Despite the variety

highlights
their differences with regards to the dehydration reaction, the cyclization
processes also have distinct features despite being catalyzed by enzymes
or domains with clear sequence similarities. Phylogenetic analyses
of the LanC enzymes with the cyclization domains of class II–IV
lanthipeptide synthetases show that they have evolved separately with
perhaps a common ancient ancestor.35,36,404 Although the classification scheme for lanthipeptides

of the biosynthetic
enzymes and their substrates. This has been seen in the tRNA and leader
peptide specificity of class I dehydratases, and in the observation
of clusters containing substrates that lack Cys and synthetases that
have lost the conserved catalytic residues for cyclization.196,368 With respect to the regio- and stereoselectivity of cyclization,
several studies have demonstrated that the final outcome may be at
least in part determined by the substrate. The enzyme is still required
for efficient catalysis, as indicated by comparisons with nonenzymatic
processes, but the ultimate ring topology and stereochemistry is in
some of the cases that have been investigated determined by the substrate
sequence. As such, similarities exist with protein folding in that
lanthipeptide cyclases could serve like folding chaperones to let
the substrate adopt its preferred conformation on the enzyme and to
then lock this conformation by catalyzing covalent cross-link formation. Phylogenetic analysis also supports coevolution

better understood than a decade ago,44 many
questions remain and new questions have been raised by the discovery
of two new pathways and the mechanistic, crystallographic, and bioinformatics
studies that have been conducted on the previously known pathways.
Further advancement of our understanding will likely require studies
on the dynamic interactions of the enzymes and their substrates and
investigation of the makeup of the lanthipeptide synthetase complexes.
While challenging to study, the lanthipeptide biosynthetic enzymes
offer so much promise with respect to bioengineering and synthetic
biology applications that continuing investigations are warranted. Even though the enzymology of lanthipeptide biosynthesis is much
