Type III polyketide synthase (PKS) found in bacteria is known as 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene synthase (THNS). Microbial type III PKSs synthesize various compounds that possess crucial biological functions and significant pharmaceutical activities. Based on our sequence analysis, we have identified a putative type III polyketide synthase from Nocardia sp. CS682 was named as ThnA. The role of ThnA, in Nocardia sp. CS682 during the biosynthesis of 1,3,6,8 tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN), which is the key intermediate of 1-(α-L-(2-O-methyl)-6-deoxymannopyranosyloxy)-3,6,8-trimethoxynaphthalene (IBR-3) was characterized. ThnA utilized five molecules of malonyl-CoA as a starter substrate to generate the polyketide 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene, which could spontaneously be oxidized to the red flaviolin compound 2,5,7-trihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone. The amino acid sequence alignment of ThnA revealed similarities with a previously identified type III PKS and identified Cys138, Phe188, His270, and Asn303 as four highly conserved active site amino acid residues, as found in other known polyketide synthases. In this study, we report the heterologous expression of the type III polyketide synthase thnA in S. lividan TK24 and the identification of THN production in a mutant strain. We also compared the transcription level of thnA in S. lividan TK24 and S. lividan pIBR25-thnA and found that thnA was only transcribed in the mutant. Introduction Introduction Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are a group of enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis of complex and biologically active metabolites in all living organisms, ranging from microorganisms to plants. These enzymes work in a coordinated and sequential manner to produce these essential compounds [1-3]. Polyketides are a diverse family of natural products that display a vast array of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antiparasitic, antifungal, and anticancer properties. They have also various commercial applications as food additives, nutraceuticals, and pigments [4-10]. The synthesis of most polyketides involves the use of three main classes of PKSs, namely type I PKS, type II PKS, and type III PKS. These three types of PKSs use a similar mechanism of sequential decarboxylative condensations, which can take place with a diverse range of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) substrates [11, 12-14]. Type I PKSs are mainly composed of multifunctional proteins that consist of various modules. These modules have non-iterative functions that are responsible for catalyzing one cycle of polyketide chain elongation [15]. Type II PKSs are characterized as multienzyme complexes, where each catalytic domain is encoded by a separate gene [13]. Type III PKSs are generally homodimeric enzymes with a single active site iteratively acting as condensing enzymes [1]. Type III PKSs, which are relatively small homodimeric proteins consisting of monomers weighing between 40-47 kDa, play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides in both bacterial and plant PKSs [7]. Type III PKSs are widely distributed in bacteria, plants, and fungi. The synthesis of 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN) occurs through the catalytic action of RppA, which utilizes five malonyl-CoA molecules to produce THN which subsequently undergoes spontaneous oxidation to form flaviolin (Fig. 1). It was the first functionally characterized bacterial THN synthase from Streptomyces griseus [16].

It was the first functionally characterized bacterial THN synthase from Streptomyces griseus [16]. Type III PKSs are known to produce THNs as the predominant metabolites in several actinomycetes, including S. griseus [17], Saccharopolyspora erythrea [18], S. peucetius [6], S. toxytricini [19], and Sorangium cellulosum [20]. Nocardia sp. CS682 contains ThnA, one of the type III PKSs found in the Nocardia sp. CS682 genome [21]. Although its biological function is currently unknown, ThnA has been implicated in the biosynthesis of 1-(α-L-(2-O-methyl)-6-deoxymannopyranosyloxy)-3,6,8-trimethoxynaphthalene (IBR-3) [22]. Nocardia sp. produces a UV-protective compound known as IBR-3, which is formed by removing the complete PKS region of nargenicin [15]. Different enzymes like methyltransferases and glycosyltransferase are involved in the post-modification of 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN) during the formation of IBR-3 (Fig. 2) [15, 21, 22]. Due to the crucial role played by ThnA in forming the core THN scaffold, we carried out a sequence alignment of ThnA with established type III PKSs. This alignment yielded a high level of bootstrap support, thereby strengthening the case for heterologous expression.

In this study, we characterized the function of thnA by heterologous expression in S. lividan sp. TK24. ThnA is a key enzyme in the production of 1-(α-L-(2-O-methyl)-6-deoxymannopyranosyloxy)-3,6,8-trimethoxynaphthalene from five malonyl-CoA molecules to form THN, which undergoes further modifications by methyltransferases and glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in this pathway to yield the final product IBR-3.

RNA Sample Preparation and Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis RNA Sample Preparation and Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis RNA Sample Preparation and Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis To extract total RNA, each 5 ml aliquot of culture that was grown for approximately 72 h was suspended in RNA protect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen, Germany) for a duration of 5 min. RNA isolation was carried out using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the guidelines provided by the manufacturer. DNase (Qiagen) was used to treat contaminating DNA in the RNA samples, and the lack of contamination was verified by PCR analysis using the RNA as a template. To assess the purity and concentration of the total RNA, a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1601 PC) was utilized to measure the optical density at 260/280 nm. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed with a QuantiTech SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The primers used for thnA (158 bp) were 5'-CCGAGCGCTAGGAAACG-3' (forward) and 5'-ATCCGAGCTGCGCGATA-3' (reverse), and for the control housekeeping gene [rpoB (181 bp)] they were 5'-AGTTCGGCGAGTACGAGTC-3' (forward) and 5'-ACCTTGGCGAGGTCGTAG-3' (reverse).

Results and Discussion Results and Discussion Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis of ThnA Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis of ThnA Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis of ThnA The genomic analysis of Nocardia sp. CS682 [21] showed that the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) responsible for the synthesis of 1-(α-L-(2-O-methyl)-6-deoxymannopyranosyloxy)-3,6,8-trimethoxynaphthalene consisted of PKS (ThnA) and three O-methyltransferases (ThnM1, ThnM2, and ThnM3) (Fig. 2). ThnA was putatively annotated for the production of 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphtalene (THN) from malonyl-CoA. The thnA gene encodes a protein consisting of 374 amino acids (AA), and the genés overall G+C content is 56%. According to BLAST searches, thnA shows significant similarity with other type III PKS genes in the database. The amino acid sequence alignment of ThnA, as illustrated in Fig. 3, exhibited the existence of four extensively conserved residues, namely Cys138, Phe188, His270, and Asn303, which are present in other known PKSs. From the structure and functional studies of chalcone synthase and other PKSs, Cys138 serves as a nucleophile that starts the reaction and makes the enzyme-bound polyketide intermediate [7, 27, 28]. Phe188 provides a hydrophobic environment that promotes the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA [29], ionic interaction of His270 plays a crucial role in stabilizing the thiolate anion of Cys168 [30], and Asn303 is responsible for catalyzing the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA [1, 30]. Additionally, it has been previously demonstrated that Tyr224 assists in substrate specificity, and its aromatic ring is considered essential for ThnA to recognize malonyl-CoA as a starter unit, much like the two other aromatic amino acids, Trp and Phe [29]. The amino acid alignment and conserved domains in ThnA suggest that it could serve as a THNS. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the protein sequences of ThnA and their closest homologs (Fig. S2). Phylogenetic tree analysis of ThnA revealed that it had the closest relationships with functionally characterized PKS. The genomic analysis of Nocardia sp. CS682 [21] showed that the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) responsible for the synthesis of 1-(α-L-(2-O-methyl)-6-deoxymannopyranosyloxy)-3,6,8-trimethoxynaphthalene consisted of PKS (ThnA) and three O-methyltransferases (ThnM1, ThnM2, and ThnM3) (Fig. 2). ThnA was putatively annotated for the production of 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphtalene (THN) from malonyl-CoA. The thnA gene encodes a protein consisting of 374 amino acids (AA), and the genés overall G+C content is 56%. According to BLAST searches, thnA shows significant similarity with other type III PKS genes in the database. The amino acid sequence alignment of ThnA, as illustrated in Fig. 3, exhibited the existence of four extensively conserved residues, namely Cys138, Phe188, His270, and Asn303, which are present in other known PKSs. From the structure and functional studies of chalcone synthase and other PKSs, Cys138 serves as a nucleophile that starts the reaction and makes the enzyme-bound polyketide intermediate [7, 27, 28].

Heterologous Expression of thnA Heterologous Expression of thnA Heterologous Expression of thnA In this study, S. lividan TK24 was utilized as a host for heterologous expression. The construction of pIBR25-thnA involved cloning the DNA fragment containing thnA into pIBR25, which was subsequently transformed into S. lividan TK24 via protoplast transformation using a standard protocol [25]. Confirmation of successful transfer of the plasmid into the heterologous host was achieved through plasmid isolation and restriction digestions (data not shown). S. lividan and S. lividan pIBR25-thnA were cultivated in R2YE liquid medium for a duration of 5 days at a temperature of 28°C. To extract the cultures, a double volume of ethyl acetate was employed, and the resulting organic supernatant fraction was subsequently concentrated using a rotary evaporator. After concentration, the sample was dissolved in a suitable volume of methanol for subsequent HPLC analysis at a UV wavelength of 330 nm by Thermo HPLC series 1100 with a Thermo-C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm). The HPLC mobile phase was composed of solvent A (water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid [TFA]) and solvent B (acetonitrile) and followed a linear gradient (10% acetonitrile at 0 min, 10 to 90% B for 1–25 min, 90 to 50% B for 25−28 min, and from 50 to 10% B for 28−30 min), at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The HPLC profile showed a distinct peak at a retention time of (tR) 15.7 min from S. lividan pIBR25-thnA, but no peak was observed from wild-type or S. lividan pIBR25 (Fig. 4A). The identity of THN and flaviolin (an auto-oxidized product of THN) was further supported by LC-ESI/MS analysis ([M+H]+ ion at m/z = 193.0489 found, calcd for C10H9O4 193.0495, and [M+H]+ ion at m/z = 207.0284 found, calcd for C10H7O5 207.0288) (Figs. 4B and 4C).

RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR Analysis RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR Analysis RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR Analysis For transcriptional analysis of thnA, S. lividan TK24 and S. lividan pIBR25-thnA were cultured in 50 ml of HT medium. Samples were taken on the third day, and mRNA was isolated using a standard protocol. Gene-specific primers were used, and rpoB, the housekeeping gene in S. lividan, was used as a control. The RT-PCR results showed the band of thnA (158 bp) in S. lividan pIBR25-thnA, which did not exist in the wild-type strain, i.e., S. lividan TK24, whereas the housekeeping rpoB showed a band (181 bp) in both strains (Fig. 5).

Conclusion Conclusion In this study, we successfully identified and characterized a type III polyketide synthase (ThnA) from Nocardia CS682. The enzyme was found to use five molecules of malonyl-CoA to synthesize 1,3,6,8 tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN), which was then modified to form the final product 1-(α-L-(2-O-methyl)-6-deoxymannopyranosyloxy)-3,6,8-trimethoxynaphthalene (IBR-3) with UV-protective properties. To validate its function, we performed the heterologous expression of thnA in S. Lividans TK24 and confirmed its expression through RT-PCR. In vivo production of flaviolin showed that the enzyme acted as a THN synthase. This characterization provides insight into the biosynthetic pathways of the important compound IBR-3.
