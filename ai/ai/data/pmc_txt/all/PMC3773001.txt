We have recently isolated tirandamycin (TAM) B from Streptomyces sp. 17944 as a Brugia malayi AsnRS (BmAsnRS) inhibitor that efficiently kills the adult B. malayi parasites and does not exhibit general cytotoxicity to human hepatic cells. We now report (i) the comparison of metabolite profiles of S. sp. 17944 in six different media, (ii) identification of a medium enabling the production of TAM B as essentially the sole metabolite, and with improved titer, and (iii) isolation and structural elucidation of three new TAM congeners. These findings shed new insights into the structure-activity relationship of TAM B as a BmAsnRS inhibitor, highlighting the δ-hydroxymethyl-α,β-epoxyketone moiety as the critical pharmacophore, and should greatly facilitate the production and isolation of sufficient quantities of TAM B for further mechanistic and preclinical studies to advance the candidacy of TAM B as an antifilarial drug lead. The current study also serves as an excellent reminder that traditional medium and fermentation optimization should continue to be very effective in improving metabolite flux and titer. INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Lymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, is caused primarily by two related parasites, Brugia malayi and Wuchereria bancrofti, and represents a worldwide health crisis with over 200 million people infected and another 20% of the global population at risk of infection.1 The asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS) in B. malayi is considered an excellent antifilarial target because (i) it is highly expressed in all stages of the parasite life cycle, (ii) it is biochemically and structurally well characterized, and (iii) it shows significant structural differences in comparison to human and other eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.2–5 As part of a drug discovery program targeting B. malayi AsnRS (BmAsnRS), we recently completed a HTS campaign of ~73,000 microextracts, from a collection of 36,720 microbial strains, for activity against the recombinant BmAsnRS.5 Subsequent bioassay-guided dereplication of two of the active strains resulted in the discovery of two natural product scaffolds, represented by tirandamycin (TAM) B (1) from Streptomyces sp. 179446 and the depsipeptide WS9326D from Streptomyces sp. 9078,7 as promising antifilarial drug leads that kill the adult B. malayi parasites at low nanomolar concentrations yet are not cytotoxic to human hepatic cells.

Under the original fermentation condition using the ISP-2 medium, 1 was produced as a minor metabolite of S. sp. 17944. Preliminary fermentation optimization improved 1 production, but still with TAM A (2) as the major metabolite together with TAM E (3), F (4), and G (5) as co-metabolites.6 In this study, we sought out medium optimization to increase 1 titer and to produce 1 as the major metabolite to facilitate the production and isolation of sufficient quantities of 1 for further mechanistic and preclinical studies, in an effort to advance the candidacy of 1 as an antifilarial drug lead. Here we now report (i) the comparison of metabolite profiles of S. sp. 17944 in six different media, (ii) identification of a medium enabling the production of 1 as essentially the sole metabolite and with improved titer, and (iii) isolation and structural elucidation of three new TAM congeners, H (6), I (7), and J (8), shedding new insights into the structure-activity-relationship (SAR) of 1 as a BmAsnRS inhibitor and an antifilarial drug lead.

Medium optimization of S. sp. 17944 for TAM production Medium optimization of S. sp. 17944 for TAM production Medium optimization of S. sp. 17944 for TAM production S. sp. 17944 was grown in six media, with varying carbon and nitrogen sources as well as metal ions, under the optimized fermentation conditions. The crude extracts were subjected to HPLC analysis to determine the TAM metabolite profiles, which varied significantly (Figure 2). While the ISP-2 medium yielded a mixture of TAMs, with 2 as the major TAM metabolite, a similarly metabolite profile was observed for medium B. In contrast, medium 042 produced 1 and both media 038 and F afforded 2 essentially as the sole TAM metabolite, respectively. Finally, medium SLY significantly suppressed the production of 1 and 2, and accumulated instead 3 and 5 as the major metabolites, two TAMs only produced in trace quantities in the original ISP-2 medium, as well as at least three new TAMs as minor metabolites (Figure 2).

The titers of 1 in the six media were determined on the basis of HPLC analysis calibrated with an authentic 1 standard (Table 1). Under the optimized fermentation conditions using medium 042, 1 can be produced essentially as the sole TAM metabolite with a titer at approximately 22 mg/L.

A large-scale fermentation of S. sp. 17944 in medium SLY (6 L), followed by multiple steps of SiO2, Sephadex LH-20, and preparative C-18 chromatography, afforded three new TAM congeners, 6 (8.7 mg), 7 (6.9 mg), and 8 (2.8 mg).

The molecular formula of 6 was deducted as C22H29NO8 based on the HRESIMS spectrum that gave [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 436.1989 and 458.1811 (calculated [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 436.1971 and 458.1790), respectively. Comparison of the 1H and 13C data (Table 2) of 6 with previously reported TAM congeners6 indicated a close structural similarity among these compounds, which is further confirmed by the consistent appearance of the geminal protons of the tetramic acid methylene carbon and the olefinic and methyl signals of the dienoyl acyl chain (Figure 3). Thus, COSY and HMBC correlations of 6 demonstrated a close identity to 3, which was isolated previously from S. sp. 17944.6 The disappearance of the H3-18 signal with the concomitant appearance of oxymethylene moiety (δC 59.1, C-18 and δH 4.43 and 4.31, H2-18) (Table 2), which is also supported by the 16 mass unit difference from 6 and 3, suggests that 6 is likely a C-10 hydroxylated congener of 3. This new moiety was further confirmed by the gHMBC correlations of H2-18 to C-11 (δC 61.3), C-12 (δC 60.2), and C-13 (δC 96.7) (Figure 3). Since the absolute stereochemistry of 2 was known,6,20

HRESIMS analysis of 7 yielded [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 582.2583 and 604.2405, respectively, predicting a molecular formula of C28H39NO12 (calculated [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 582.2550 and 604.2369). The 13C NMR data of 7 (Table 1) was very similar to those of 36 with the exception of extra six resonances, which indicated an additional hexose moiety. The structure of the aglycone moiety was further confirmed to be 3 by key COSY and HMBC correlations (Figure 3). The hexose moiety was established by a 1D-TOCSY experiment, verified to be a glucoside by gHSQC, gHMBC, gCOSY, and TOCSY correlations, and further confirmed to be an α-glucoside by comparison with previously reported NMR data and analysis of the coupling constant for the anomeric proton H-1″ (δc 5.51, d, J = 2.4 Hz) (Table 2).21,22 The glucosidic linkage was established at position C-10 by the gHMBC correlation of the anomeric proton H-1″ (δH 5.51) to C-10 (δC 71.3). This was further supported by the NOESY correlations between H-10 (δH 4.83) and H-1″ (δH 5.51), which also showed correlations to H-3″ (δH 4.47) and H-5″ (δH 4.34), confirming the α-D-glucoside configuration (Figure 3). On the basis of these data, 7 was assigned as TAM I, a TAM E-10-α-D-glucoside with its absolute stereochemistry inferred from biosynthesis (Figure 1).

On the basis of these data, 7 was assigned as TAM I, a TAM E-10-α-D-glucoside with its absolute stereochemistry inferred from biosynthesis (Figure 1). The molecular formula C30H37NO12 for 8 was established on the basis of HRESIMS analysis that afforded [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 596.2376 and 618.2198 (calculated [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 596.2343 and 618.2162), respectively. Careful comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data of 8 (Table 2) with previously reported TAM congeners revealed a close identity to 1 with an additional hexose moiety. The latter was confirmed to be an α-glucoside by comparison with NMR data of the hexose moiety of 7 (Table 2), the coupling constant of the anomeric proton H-1″ (δc 5.47, d, J = 2.5 Hz), and the COSY and TOCSY correlations. Thus, the glucosidic linkage was established at position C-18 by the gHMBC correlation of the anomeric proton H-1″ (δH 5.47) to C-18 (δC 57.8). This was further supported by the NOESY correlations between H2-18 (δH 4.68, 4.13) and H-1″ (δH 5.47) (Figure 3). These data allowed the final assignment of 8 as TAM J, a TAM B-180-α-D-glucoside with its absolute stereochemistry similarly deduced on the base of biosynthesis (Figure 1). The molecular formula C30H37NO12 for 8 was established on the basis of HRESIMS analysis that afforded [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 596.2376 and 618.2198 (calculated [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 596.2343 and 618.2162), respectively.

Thus, the glucosidic linkage was established at position C-18 by the gHMBC correlation of the anomeric proton H-1″ (δH 5.47) to C-18 (δC 57.8). This was further supported by the NOESY correlations between H2-18 (δH 4.68, 4.13) and H-1″ (δH 5.47) (Figure 3). These data allowed the final assignment of 8 as TAM J, a TAM B-180-α-D-glucoside with its absolute stereochemistry similarly deduced on the base of biosynthesis (Figure 1). The molecular formula C30H37NO12 for 8 was established on the basis of HRESIMS analysis that afforded [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 596.2376 and 618.2198 (calculated [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 596.2343 and 618.2162), respectively.

1 and 2 were originally discovered as bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitors.23 It was not until very recently, 1 and 2 were re-discovered from the marine S. sp. 307-9 during the screen for activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis,10 together with two new congeners, TAM C (9) and D (10), from marine S. sp. SCSIO 166611 in an effort to discover new bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitors, together with TAM C2 (11), and from S. sp. 17944 in our current program to discover BmAsnRS inhibitors as antifilarial drug leads,6 together with the three congeners 3, 4, and 5, previously, and three additional congeners, 6, 7, and 8, in this study. During the characterization of the TAM biosynthetic machinery in S. sp. 307-912 and S. sp. SCSIO 166613,15,16 and in vitro characterization of the TamI P-450 oxygenase,13 a biosynthetic intermediate, 12, was isolated, which unfortunately were given two different names concurrently, TAM F and TAM E. This nomenclature was further complicated by the fact that both TAM F and TAM E were concurrently taken for 3 and 4, respectively, from S. sp. 17944.6 In an attempt to eliminate these confusion, we now propose to reserve TAM E and F for 3 and 4, respectively, and rename 12 as TAM C1 following the precedence of TAM C2 for 11.15 Finally, in vivo characterization of trdE in S. sp. SCSIO 1666 and in vitro study of TrdE resulted in the identification of pre-tirandamycin (13) as the nascent intermediate of the TAM hybrid PKS-NRPS.16 Taken together, a total of 13 TAM congeners have been isolated from the five producers (Figure 1).

The cloning and sequencing of the TAM biosynthetic gene cluster from S. sp. 307-912 and S. sp. SCSIO 1666,13,15,16 respectively, opened the possibility to manipulate the TAM biosynthetic machinery for TAM production. The TAM biosynthetic pathway features the TAM hybrid PKS-NRPS for the biosynthesis of 13, which is first dehydrated by TrdE to afford 9 and subsequently oxidized sequentially by TamI and TamL, via the intermediacy of 11/12, 10, and 2, to 1, and this pathway is supported by the isolation of all the proposed biosynthetic intermediates from S. sp. 307-9 and S. sp. SCSIO 1666 wild-type and mutant strains.12–16 In a biosynthetic analogy to S. sp. 307-9 and S. sp. SCSIO 1666, the same pathway for TAM biosynthesis could be proposed in S. sp. 17944, with additional tailoring steps to account for the formation of 3–8 (Figure 1). Thus, while the formation of 3, 4, and 5 from 2 could have resulted from adventitious reductase activities, hydroxylation of 3 to 6 would be consistent with the broad substrate specificity known for TamI.14 The fact that 6 is not detected when 1 is the dominate metabolite and isolated only when 3 is produced in high yield further supports 3, rather than 1, as the likely precursor for 6 (Figures 1 and 2). Bioinformatics analysis of the tam and trd clusters from S. sp. 307-912 and S. sp. SCSIO 166614 has failed to unveil any candidate potentially conferring TAM self-resistance to the producing Streptomyces. Although no gene encoding glucosyltransferase was identified within the cloned tam and trd cluster, it is tempting to speculate that glucosylation may represent one of the resistance mechanisms in S. sp. 17944 as exemplified by the isolation of 7 and 8.22 Finally, TamI plays the fundamental role in catalyzing minimally three steps of oxidations in 1 biosynthesis,12–14 and overexpression of tamI, thereby channeling all the biosynthetic intermediates to completion, therefore represents an outstanding opportunity to engineer a 1 overproducer (Figure 1). Strategies of overexpressing genes controlling rate-limiting steps to alter the metabolic flux or manipulating pathway regulation for titer improvement have been well demonstrated and successfully exploited for the production of targeted metabolites.24–27 Although our success in medium optimization and identification of conditions for S. sp 17944 to produce 1 exclusively with good titer neglects the need to consider genetic approaches to alter metabolic flux and improve metabolite titer, cloning of the tamI gene and development of an expedient genetic system for S. sp. 17944 in the current study certainly set the stage for such endeavor should they be justified by future needs.

The discovery of 1 as a novel BmAsnRS inhibitor, which efficiently kills the adult B. malayi parasites and does not exhibit general cytotoxicity to human hepatic cells, underscores the great potential of our innovative HTS targeting BmAsnRS for antifilarial drug discovery.6,7 The microbial origin of these leads promises that they can be produced in sufficient quantities by scale up fermentation and their biosynthetic machinery could be subjected to combinatorial biosynthetic strategies for titer improvement and structural diversity, greatly facilitating follow-up mechanistic and preclinical studies.28 The current study also serves as an excellent reminder that traditional medium and fermentation optimization could remain very effective in improving metabolite flux and titer, as exemplified by the exclusive production of 1 in good titer upon fermenting S. sp. 17944 in the 042 medium. Medium optimization of S. sp. 17944 fermentation also enabled the production, thereby isolation and characterization, of three new TAM congeners, 6, 7, and 8. These new TAM congeners not only shed new insight into TAM biosynthesis and potential mechanisms of resistance, but also further support to the SAR of TAMs – (i) the δ-hydroxymethyl-α,β-epoxyketone moiety is critical for the BmAsnRS inhibitory activity, as highlighted by 1, and (ii) reduction of carbonyl group at C-10, as in 6, or the glucosylation of the hydroxymethyl group at C-18, as in 8, completely abolishes the activity.6 The discovery of 1 as a novel BmAsnRS inhibitor, which efficiently kills the adult B. malayi parasites and does not exhibit general cytotoxicity to human hepatic cells, underscores the great potential of our innovative HTS targeting BmAsnRS for antifilarial drug discovery.6,7 The microbial origin of these leads promises that they can be produced in sufficient quantities by scale up fermentation and their biosynthetic machinery could be subjected to combinatorial biosynthetic strategies for titer improvement and structural diversity, greatly facilitating follow-up mechanistic and preclinical studies.28 The current study also serves as an excellent reminder that traditional medium and fermentation optimization could remain very effective in improving metabolite flux and titer, as exemplified by the exclusive production of 1 in good titer upon fermenting S. sp. 17944 in the 042 medium.

The dry resins/cells were extracted with 20 mL MeOH twice, and the combined MeOH extracts were concentrated in vacuo to afford the crude extracts. Each of the crude extracts was dissolved in 3 mL DMSO, and 10 μL of the resultant DMSO solutions were subjected to HPLC analysis with an Apollo C-18 column (5 μm; 4.6 × 250 mm; Grace Davison Discovery Sciences, Deerfield, IL). The column was developed with a 30-min gradient from 15% CH3CN in 0.1% HCO2H to 100% CH3CN at flow rate of 1 mL/min and UV detection at 351 nm.

Fifteen 2-L baffled Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 400 mL of SLY medium, were then inoculated with 25 mL of the seed culture each and grown for 7 days under the same fermentation condition. The production cultures were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm and 4°C for 30 min to collect the mycelia, and the broth was extracted with 3% Amberlite XAD-16 resins, which were collected by centrifugation. The mycelia and resins were combined and extracted three times with methanol. The combined methanol elution was then concentrated in vacuo to afford the crude extract (4.2 g).6 This material was subjected to SiO2 chromatography, eluted step-wise with CHCl3:CH3OH (100:0, 50:1, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1 and 0:100, 1-L each) as the mobile phase, to afford eight fractions, A-H. Fraction F (608 mg) was further chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 column, eluted with CH3OH to yield four sub-fractions, F1-F4. F3 was finally purified by semipreparative HPLC to afford pure 6 (8.7 mg), 7 (6.9 mg), 8 (2.8 mg), in addition to 1 and 2.
