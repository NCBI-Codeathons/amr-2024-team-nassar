The human gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin is a possible key driver of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Understanding colibactin’s biological effects remains difficult owing to the instability of the proposed active species and the complexity of the gut microbiota. Here, we report small molecule boronic acid inhibitors of colibactin biosynthesis. Designed to mimic the biosynthetic precursor precolibactin, these compounds potently inhibit the colibactin-activating peptidase ClbP. Using biochemical assays and crystallography, we show that they engage the ClbP binding pocket, forming a covalent bond with the catalytic serine. These inhibitors reproduce the phenotypes observed in a clbP deletion mutant and block the genotoxic effects of colibactin on eukaryotic cells. The availability of ClbP inhibitors will allow precise, temporal control over colibactin production, enabling further study of its contributions to CRC. Finally, application of our inhibitors to related peptidase-encoding pathways highlights the power of chemical tools to probe natural product biosynthesis.  A substrate-guided design strategy generated highly potent inhibitors of the biosynthesis of the genotoxin colibactin by human gut bacteria. These inhibitors also enable a generalizable approach for chemically guided natural product discovery. Subject terms Main Main The trillions of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms colonizing the human gut, collectively termed the gut microbiota, secrete a diverse milieu of small molecules with profound impacts on human health1. In particular, several members of this community are proposed to play roles in the development of CRC, potentially through the production of small-molecule natural products or protein toxins2,3. Despite the identification and association of possible microbial culprits with CRC, we still have limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the contributions of these organisms to carcinogenesis because of the inherent challenges of studying a complex and dynamic microbial community.

Despite the identification and association of possible microbial culprits with CRC, we still have limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the contributions of these organisms to carcinogenesis because of the inherent challenges of studying a complex and dynamic microbial community. These challenges are exemplified by recent efforts to characterize the genotoxic gut bacterial natural product colibactin. Colibactin is produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase–polyketide synthase assembly line encoded by the pks genomic island, which is carried by many strains of Escherichia coli (pks+
E. coli)4,5. Although it was initially observed over a decade ago that pks+
E. coli elicit a genotoxic phenotype and cause DNA double-strand breaks in cultured epithelial cells, the chemical species responsible for these effects could not be readily identified4. Based on extensive metabolomics6–8, characterization of biosynthetic enzymes9 and total synthesis10, potential structures of colibactin have been proposed, although it has not been isolated from a natural source. The proposed structure that is most consistent with colibactin’s DNA alkylating11 and crosslinking12 activity contains two highly electrophilic cyclopropane warheads linked by a 1,2-diketone; the sensitivity of this linkage to oxidative C–C bond cleavage may explain the difficulty of isolation9,10. Formation of the warheads is accomplished in the final step of biosynthesis by the periplasmic peptidase ClbP, which hydrolyzes two units of the N-myristoyl-d-asparagine ‘prodrug scaffold’ from a larger pseudodimeric precursor, precolibactin13,14. This reaction releases the active species, colibactin, which alkylates two adenine residues on opposite strands of the target cell’s DNA, resulting in highly toxic and mutagenic DNA interstrand crosslinks10,12. These crosslinks can break down into monoadducts that are detectable in genomic DNA extracted from cultured cells and epithelial tissue of mice infected with pks+

E. coli in culture can cause mutations that lead to changes in growth factor dependence and differentiation in murine colon cells21. However, colibactin-dependent mutational signatures were also found in biopsies of morphologically normal colon crypts and were shown to accumulate primarily before the individual reached 10 years of age22. Thus, although colibactin is strongly correlated with CRC, the timing and duration of the colibactin insult is likely an important variable in determining CRC risk and is still poorly understood.

Although studies have illuminated a great deal about colibactin’s carcinogenic potential, they also underscore that this natural product and its biosynthetic enzymes are part of a complex network of interactions that cannot be untangled with current tools. Deletion of any of the biosynthetically essential pks island genes abolishes production of colibactin, although different deletion mutants in the same strain background result in different phenotypes in vivo, suggesting other roles for these enzymes23,24. Genes in the pks island have also been linked to a number of seemingly disparate functions including siderophore biosynthesis and microcin production25,26. Because the genotoxic effects of colibactin are cell-contact and inflammation dependent, it is challenging to distinguish its effects from other changes in the gut microbiota and host metabolism that occur during periods of inflammation15,27. pks+

Investigating these questions requires examining colibactin’s effects in the context of a complex gut community, which is difficult to accomplish with genetic tools. Whole-gene deletions may alter other pathways in which the gene product plays a structural role, and there is evidence that ClbP performs additional, noncatalytic functions in other biosynthetic pathways26. Genetic knockouts cannot offer temporal control, making it impossible to probe the importance of timing in colibactin exposure. Controlling exposure using direct addition of colibactin is currently impossible due to its instability and unresolved identity. A tool compound that specifically inhibits colibactin production would shed light on these questions by enabling studies of colibactin in complex pks+ communities with greater precision than is currently possible.

To address this need, we designed and characterized a series of boronic acid-based inhibitors of colibactin biosynthesis.

E. coli and pks+ communities. We confirm that these inhibitors completely block the genotoxic effects of colibactin on mammalian cells in culture. Finally, we show that these compounds can also inhibit closely related peptidases found in biosynthetic pathways from soil bacteria, illustrating that this strategy can be generalized to discover biosynthetic intermediates and study the biological roles of other recalcitrant natural products from genetically intractable organisms.

ClbP contains a catalytic triad typical of the S12 family of serine peptidases formed by the essential residues S95, K98 and Y186 (ref. 13). We aimed to target S95 by exploiting ClbP’s essential and unusual acyl-d-Asn substrate-recognition motif (Fig. 1a). Boron-based electrophiles have frequently been employed in inhibitors of serine and threonine peptidases35, but posed a synthetic challenge here because of the proximity of the potentially nucleophilic asparagine side chain.

This panel of compounds was initially evaluated using an in vitro fluorogenic ClbP activity assay33. With 25 nM purified ClbP, all compounds had median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between 20 and 80 nM after 1 h preincubation, indicating similar potency (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). Because these compounds were designed to inhibit ClbP by forming a covalent bond with the critical active site serine residue, we examined the kinetics of inhibition using this assay. Highly potent boronic acid-based inhibitors often exhibit slow-binding kinetics, where the free inhibitor is in equilibrium with the noncovalently bound inhibitor–enzyme complex and the subsequent covalent bond-forming step is rate-limiting37. As expected for this type of binding, preincubating 100 nM 1–4 with ClbP for varying amounts of time confirmed that longer preincubation leads to increased potency (Fig. 2b). Although 1–3 reached maximum potency within 30 min, 4 showed a substantial lag, suggesting that the initial noncovalent complex of 4 with ClbP is weaker. Previous work showed that ClbP substrates with smaller acyl groups exhibit higher KM values, so the relatively smaller phenyl substituent of 4 may explain this difference33.

Although 1–3 reached maximum potency within 30 min, 4 showed a substantial lag, suggesting that the initial noncovalent complex of 4 with ClbP is weaker. Previous work showed that ClbP substrates with smaller acyl groups exhibit higher KM values, so the relatively smaller phenyl substituent of 4 may explain this difference33. Further control experiments ruled out boronate ester hydrolysis as being rate-limiting (Extended Data Fig. 1).Fig. 2Compounds 1–4 inhibit ClbP activity.a, ClbP activity in vitro upon treatment with 1–4 using a fluorescent substrate analog. b, ClbP activity in vitro upon treatment with 1–4 at 100 nM and varying incubation time before initiating the assay. c, Activity of E. coli overexpressing ClbP toward a fluorescent substrate analog after treatment with 1–4.

Establishing the mechanism of ClbP inhibition Establishing the mechanism of ClbP inhibition Establishing the mechanism of ClbP inhibition To directly examine the interaction between an inhibitor and ClbP, we obtained a crystal structure of full-length ClbP bound to 1 because it bears the same type of aliphatic linear hydrocarbon tail as the native prodrug scaffold (PDB 7MDC, Supplementary Table 2). In this structure, the d-Asn side chain of the inhibitor projects into a tight-fitting pocket and hydrogen bonds with the side chains of residues S188, H257 and N331 (Fig. 3a). N331 also hydrogen bonds to E92, setting its orientation and helping to enforce ClbP’s selectivity for d-Asn- over d-Asp-containing substrates.

The inhibitor-bound structure of ClbP also reveals continuous electron density from the S95 side chain to the ligand (Fig. 3a), indicating essentially complete conversion to a covalent protein–inhibitor complex. This boronate complex is a structural analog of the tetrahedral intermediates formed during amide bond hydrolysis and participates in several stabilizing interactions that are likely relevant to the activation of precolibactin. The backbone amides of Q330 and S95 hydrogen bond to one of the boronate oxygen atoms and are thus well positioned to stabilize the negative charge that accumulates upon formation of the covalent bond with S95. In addition, Y186, which is part of the catalytic triad that defines this enzyme family, is positioned to stabilize this complex by donating a hydrogen bond to either the other boronate oxygen atom or the oxygen nucleophile on the serine side chain (Fig. 3c). Thus, the potency of these ClbP inhibitors arises both from their ability to mimic the hydrogen-bonding interactions of intermediates in the hydrolysis of precolibactin and the formation of a covalent bond with the catalytic serine residue.

Selectivity of ClbP inhibitors Selectivity of ClbP inhibitors Selectivity of ClbP inhibitors Having established that this group of compounds can bind and inhibit ClbP with high potency, we next focused on establishing the selectivity of these interactions. Because our structural studies suggest that ClbP can only accept inhibitors of this class with the S stereochemical configuration, we selected a high-potency inhibitor, 3, and synthesized the opposite enantiomer, MRV03-095 (5). We hypothesized that 5 would be a much less potent inhibitor given that N-acyl-l-Asn-containing substrates are not accepted by ClbP14,33. Indeed, 5 is 40-fold less potent than 3 at inhibiting the release of the prodrug from BWpks (Fig. 4a). The weak inhibitory effect of 5 likely results from the presence of a small amount of 3 as an expected minor product of our synthetic route.

Source data Source data Source data We next used metabolomics to investigate whether treatment with 3 could elicit the same metabolic changes in E. coli as a clbP genetic knockout. An ideal chemical probe should block colibactin biosynthesis while minimally disrupting other metabolic functions, leading to an accumulation of the same shunt metabolites that have previously been observed in pks+ ΔclbP mutant strains. We compared the metabolites produced by BWpks with the metabolites produced by an isogenic ΔclbP mutant (E. coli BW25113 BACpksΔclbP, ‘BWΔP’) using LC–MS (Fig. 4b)39. We conducted the same experiment comparing BWpks treated with 1 µM 3 versus the DMSO-treated culture (Fig. 4b). The inhibitor-treated wild-type strain displayed similar changes in metabolite abundance as the ΔclbP mutant. The primary features identified in both cases were decreased levels of the prodrug scaffold (observed 343.2609 [M+H], theoretical 343.2591 [M+H] mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)) relative to the DMSO-treated wild-type and an accumulation of known shunt metabolites from colibactin biosynthesis (precolibactins m/z 414.3004, m/z 442.3344 and m/z 713.3699)6–8. One other significant feature, an increase of a metabolite at m/z 164.1055, was observed only in the case of inhibitor treatment and is consistent with the mass of phenylbutanamide (theoretical 164.1070 [M+H] m/z), a likely degradation product of 3. Based on these observations, 3 appears to be sufficiently potent and specific to serve as a tool for precise control of ClbP activity in living organisms.

To explore other possible targets of inhibitors 1–4, we used an activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) approach to broadly assay their activity against serine hydrolases in bacterial and mammalian proteomes. In this gel-based assay, the binding of a small molecule to a target protein is detected as a decrease in that protein’s ability to bind a nonspecific fluorophosphonate (FP) probe compound which irreversibly inhibits a wide variety of serine hydrolases40. We observed no visible changes in protein labeling by FP at inhibitor concentrations of up to 100 µM in either E. coli or HEK293T cell lysates (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 3). One limitation of this assay is that ClbP is not labeled by the FP probe, so we cannot observe it as a reference for binding. However, this type of assay has been widely used to study the specificity of small molecule–protein binding interactions and provides strong evidence that most serine hydrolases do not bind inhibitors 1–441.

However, this type of assay has been widely used to study the specificity of small molecule–protein binding interactions and provides strong evidence that most serine hydrolases do not bind inhibitors 1–441. To further assess the specificity of our inhibitors, we used another ABPP assay in which we replaced the broad-spectrum FP probe with a probe that specifically targets penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), BOCILLIN-FL. We chose this probe because of ClbP’s homology to AmpC β-lactamases13. Because β-lactamases and PBPs both recognize and bind β-lactams, we reasoned that these enzymes are more likely to be secondary targets of our inhibitors. Although this labeling strategy detected several PBPs in various bacterial lysates, inhibitor 3 did not reduce the labeling of any targets (Extended Data Fig. 4). This suggests that the acyl-d-asparagine recognition motif is highly specific to ClbP and its closest homologs.

Compound 3 inhibits colibactin-associated genotoxicity Compound 3 inhibits colibactin-associated genotoxicity Compound 3 inhibits colibactin-associated genotoxicity Because colibactin is produced in the context of the gut microbiota, we need to understand how 3 can affect other members of this community and whether it remains an effective inhibitor under these conditions. We simulated a complex pks+ community by inoculating anaerobic liquid cultures with fecal pellets from C57BL/6J mice from the Jackson Laboratory, which do not contain colibactin-producing organisms, and adding E. coli NC101 to this community27. NC101 is a colibactin-producer isolated from a mouse gut for which an isogenic E. coli NC101ΔclbP mutant is available as a control42. We treated both the simulated pks+ and pksΔclbP gut communities with 3 or DMSO and monitored production of the colibactin prodrug scaffold in these cultures by LC–MS. Treatment with 3 fully suppressed production of the prodrug scaffold in the pks+ community to the same level as observed in the pksΔclbP community (Fig. 4d). To evaluate the effects of 3 on other members of the gut microbiota, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1–4 against various bacterial strains from common gut phyla, including E. coli (Supplementary Table 3). In all cases, MICs were above the upper limit tested in this assay (200 µM), although some species showed partial growth inhibition at 200 µM (Extended Data Fig. 5). The maximum concentration tested here is more than 100-fold greater than the IC50 value for inhibition of prodrug release, suggesting that 1–4 can be used at concentrations that effectively inhibit ClbP without damaging other members of the gut microbiota.

In addition to blocking the metabolic indicators of colibactin biosynthesis, we also assessed whether 3 could inhibit the genotoxic effects of colibactin on human cells. Cells exposed to colibactin exhibit cell-cycle arrest which can be quantified by DNA staining and flow cytometry4. We exposed HeLa cells to NC101 (ref. 15﻿]) and added 3 at varying concentrations in the infection medium. Treatment with 3 partially inhibits this effect at 100 nM (Fig. 5a), with complete inhibition at 1 µM. We also confirmed that 3 is not cytotoxic to human cell lines at all concentrations tested (≤10 µM, Extended Data Fig. 6).Fig. 5Compound 3 prevents colibactin-induced genotoxicity in human cells.a, Flow cytometry analysis of HeLa cells infected with NC101 and treated with 3.

All conditions were run in three biological replicates with one representative sample shown. Source data Source data Source data To directly assess the impacts of 3 on colibactin’s DNA alkylating activity, we infected HeLa cells with NC101 with or without 3 added and isolated their genomic DNA. This DNA was hydrolyzed and analyzed by LC–MS to detect two diastereomeric colibactin-derived DNA adducts (Fig. 5b)11. Treatment with 1 µM 3 suppressed adduct formation similarly to genetic deletion of clbP. Finally, we assessed the impact of 3 on the response to colibactin-mediated DNA damage in HeLa cells. In response to stalled replication forks caused by DNA crosslinks, the protein FANCD2 is monoubiquitinated (FANCD2-Ub)43, and cell lines missing FANCD2 show increased sensitivity to colibactin12. Using a western blot, we detected an increase in abundance of FANCD2-Ub in HeLa cells in response to exposure to NC101, as well as in response to the DNA crosslinking agents mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin (Fig. 5c). Treatment of cells with 1 µM 3 prevented FANCD2 ubiquitination in cells exposed to colibactin but not MMC or cisplatin, indicating that 3 is specific to the colibactin biosynthetic pathway and does not inhibit the DNA damage response. Thus, compound 3 is not only an inhibitor of ClbP, but a potent and specific inhibitor of colibactin’s genotoxicity.

Because compounds 1–4 exploit ClbP’s unusual N-acyl-d-asparagine recognition motif, we expected them to also inhibit ClbP’s closest relatives which hydrolyze similar substrates. Although no ClbP homologs have been annotated outside of the pks gene cluster in organisms from the human gut microbiota, they are widely distributed in biosynthetic gene clusters from environmental bacteria38. As genetic deletion of clbP causes an accumulation of upstream biosynthetic intermediates and shunt products, characterization of which was key to the structural elucidation of colibactin6–8, we reasoned that 3 could be used in a similar fashion to identify other natural products biosynthesized using an N-acyl-d-asparagine-mediated prodrug activation step.

We first tested this approach by targeting ZmaM, a ClbP homolog that is proposed to activate the antibiotic zwittermicin44. Though zwittermicin biosynthesis was the first pathway proposed to use this type of prodrug mechanism, the precursor prezwittermicin has not yet been identified. As expected, 1–4 inhibit purified ZmaM with similar potency to ClbP in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 8). We compared the metabolite profiles of untreated cultures of the zwittermicin producer Bacillus cereus UW85 and cultures exposed to 3 using LC–MS. Treatment with 3 caused an accumulation of a species whose mass is consistent with the proposed structure of prezwittermicin (observed 693.4136, theoretical 693.4141 [M+H] m/z, Fig. 6a). In addition, masses consistent with both free zwittermicin (observed 397.2046, theoretical 397.2041 [M+H] m/z) and a free N-lauroyl-d-asparagine (observed 315.2279, theoretical 315.2278 [M+H] m/z) were depleted in the treated cultures (Fig. 6a). MS/MS fragmentation patterns of these ions and their counterparts from cultures fed 13C4-asparagine support these structural assignments (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 9). The successful detection of prezwittermicin highlights the capabilities of an inhibitor-guided discovery approach.

The successful detection of prezwittermicin highlights the capabilities of an inhibitor-guided discovery approach. We then applied this strategy to study edeines, a family of natural products whose biosynthetic gene cluster encodes a ClbP homolog, but whose production has never been reported to involve a prodrug resistance mechanism38,45. We treated the edeine producer Brevibacillus formosus ATCC 51669 with 3 and observed a depletion of several masses corresponding to edeines, as well as masses consistent with both N-lauroyl- and N-myristoyl-d-asparagine (Fig. 6b). There are currently four known members of the edeine family (A, B, D and F), each of which has two naturally occurring structural isomers (1 or 2)45. Focusing on edeine A, treatment with 3 resulted in accumulation of a mass consistent with a larger premetabolite incorporating the N-myristoyl-d-asparagine motif (observed 1155.5952, theoretical 1155.5940 [M+2K-H] m/z, Fig. 6b). Employing the same 13C4-asparagine labeling and MS/MS fragmentation strategy, we observed +4 m/z shifts in the mass corresponding to this putative premetabolite, as well as consistent with N-lauroyl- and N-myristoyl-d-asparagine (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 9). Based on this, we propose that edeine biosynthesis uses a prodrug activation strategy and that the larger mass discovered after treatment with 3 represents a newly discovered ‘preedeine’. The greater number of metabolites that change in abundance after treatment with 3 in B. formosus compared with B. cereus likely reflects the known structural diversity of edeines. Further adding to this complexity, bioinformatic analyses reported in an accompanying paper identified a gene encoding a second ClbP homolog in B. formosus (locus tag BP422_09930 in the CP018145.1 genome), suggesting that it produces another family of uncharacterized natural products using a similar prodrug resistance strategy38. It is likely that some of the mass shifts that we observed can be attributed to this cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster. Together, these experiments demonstrate that compound 3 can be used as a tool to discover and study other natural products from diverse environmental microbes.

Discussion Discussion Leveraging our understanding of colibactin biosynthesis, we developed a panel of compounds that can potently and specifically inhibit the colibactin-activating peptidase ClbP. Past observations that ClbP recognizes a structural motif not commonly found in other metabolites made it well-suited for substrate-guided inhibitor design. Notably, none of the inhibitors tested here show substantial differences in activity in vitro, despite bearing different N-acyl structures. This may indicate that the acyl group serves only a weak role in initial substrate recognition, while potency is driven by the reversible covalent bond formed between ClbP’s catalytic serine residue and the boronic acid electrophile. Distinguishing which features are essential for potency and recognition will aid future medicinal chemistry efforts, as well as the design of other chemical tools with additional chemical functionality in the acyl group of the molecule.

In addition to their high potency for ClbP inhibition, these compounds do not appear to interact with any of the other serine hydrolases examined in our assays. A potential risk of using electrophilic inhibitors is that their high potency and slow off-rates will lead to inhibition of many cellular targets. We surveyed a broad range of potential secondary targets, including PBPs in the same β-lactamase family as ClbP, using ABPP assays and did not observe evidence of off-target activity. Metabolomics experiments illustrate that treatment with these compounds does not broadly change metabolism outside of the colibactin biosynthetic pathway. Examining additional aspects of inhibitor selectivity would be aided by the preparation of chemical tools based on 1–4 which can form irreversible covalent bonds with ClbP and other potential targets. However, the fact that these compounds show limited toxicity to various organisms, including bacteria and mammalian cells, and minimal metabolic perturbation outside of the colibactin pathway are strong evidence that their off-target effects are low.

One of the most promising aspects of these inhibitors is the opportunity they provide to study colibactin’s effects in the context of a complex pks+ community. We show that 3 can selectively block colibactin biosynthesis in E. coli NC101 in the presence of a complex gut community without antibiotic activity toward representatives of major gut bacterial phyla. These experiments also showed that baseline production of the prodrug scaffold is more than tenfold lower when pks+
E. coli are present in low abundance in a community setting versus in monoculture. This dramatic difference is a reminder that studies in which germ-free mice are monocolonized with pks+ bacteria cannot offer a complete picture of colibactin’s impacts in a community context. Small molecule tools like 3 will enable studies to determine whether observations from monocolonization studies can be reproduced in conventional hosts with pks+ communities.

Small molecule tools like 3 will enable studies to determine whether observations from monocolonization studies can be reproduced in conventional hosts with pks+ communities. Finally, we confirmed that, in addition to blocking the formation of key metabolites like the prodrug scaffold, 3 can also prevent the genotoxic effects of colibactin on human cells. Treatment with 3 prevents cell-cycle arrest, DNA adduct formation and FANCD2 ubiquitination, biomarkers widely used to monitor colibactin’s genotoxicity11,12,15. A major challenge to studying colibactin has been the inability to establish precise control over colibactin exposure, limiting our ability to establish clear, causal connections between this unique toxin and the changes in the host which have been attributed to its activity. Our inhibitors can address this problem and allow us to dissect colibactin’s role in cancer with a new level of detail.

A major challenge to studying colibactin has been the inability to establish precise control over colibactin exposure, limiting our ability to establish clear, causal connections between this unique toxin and the changes in the host which have been attributed to its activity. Our inhibitors can address this problem and allow us to dissect colibactin’s role in cancer with a new level of detail. These chemical tools can also be applied beyond the context of colibactin and the gut microbiota. The family of prodrug-activating peptidases related to ClbP is highly selective in substrate scope and widely distributed in biosynthetic gene clusters from environmental bacteria46. We showed that our inhibitors can selectively disrupt production of both zwittermicin and the edeines. These experiments allowed us to uncover the biosynthetic intermediate ‘prezwittermicin’, which had only been predicted based on the biosynthetic gene cluster. Moreover, we provide the first experimental observation, to our knowledge, of preedeine metabolites, directly demonstrating how targeted small molecule inhibitors can be used for natural product discovery. We envision the general strategy of combining metabolomics analysis with inhibitors of biosynthetic enzymes may be applied more broadly to enable studies of natural products which are difficult to isolate, synthesize, or study with genetic tools.

Chemical modulation of gut microbial functions is a promising avenue both for therapeutic intervention and enabling basic research into the mechanisms of microbiota-host interactions47–49. Applying this strategy to colibactin biosynthesis offers a new way to interrogate the relationships between this enigmatic natural product, the surrounding microbiota, their host and cancer. Using inhibitors like 3, we can begin to understand how the duration and timing of colibactin exposure influence tumorigenesis. These inhibitors may also help illuminate the connection between colibactin and inflammation, which can be intermittent in the gut, but is essential for colibactin-related CRC in mouse models. In the long term, these molecules may serve as a starting point to evaluate colibactin biosynthesis as a therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of CRC.

Assays with ZmaM also included 5 mM Mg2+ and 1 mM ATP in the assay buffer. Purified enzyme was thawed on ice from stocks stored at –80 °C. Stocks were diluted to 50 nM enzyme in assay buffer in the wells of a black, flat-bottom 384-well plate and the appropriate inhibitor in DMSO or DMSO was added to a final concentration of 1% v/v. For experiments testing different inhibitor concentrations, reactions were allowed to sit for 1 h at room temperature. For experiments testing different preincubation times, the inhibitor in DMSO was added to each reaction X min before initiating the reaction, where X is the time indicated on the x-axis for that sample. For experiments to test whether hydrolysis of the boronic ester was rate-limiting, the inhibitor was added to buffer with no enzyme present and allowed to sit at room temperature for the time indicated before adding the enzyme. In all cases, reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 µl of buffer containing the 50 µM fluorogenic substrate to achieve a final concentration of 25 µM and pipetting once with a multichannel pipette to mix.

Compounds were eluted in an isocratic mobile phase of 5% water with 0.1% formic acid/95% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (flow rate 0.5 ml min−1; injection volume 2 ml). Compounds were detected using an Agilent 6530 Q-TOF Mass Spectrometer fitted with a dual-spray ESI source. The capillary voltage was set to 3.5 kV, the fragmentor voltage to 175 V, the skimmer voltage to 65 V and the Oct1 RF to 750 V. The drying gas temperature was maintained at 275 °C with a flow rate of 8 l min−1 and a nebulizer pressure of 241 kPa.

The instrument was operated with a capillary temperature of 300 °C and an S-Lens RF level setting of 60%. Targeted MS/MS spectra of the m/z 540.1772 analyte were acquired with a quadrupole isolation window of m/z 1.5 centered on m/z 540.2 with an HCD fragmentation setting of 25%, resolution setting of 120,000, normalized AGC target of 2,000%, and maximum injection times of 1,000 ms. All spectra were acquired with the EASY-IC lock mass (m/z 202.0777) enabled. Western blot for FANCD2 Western blot for FANCD2 Western blot for FANCD2 Infections were carried out as described above. For conditions that involved other small molecules, no bacteria were introduced during the infection and cells were treated with either 0.5 µg ml−1 MMC or 7.5 µg ml−1 cisplatin under the same conditions for 4 h. At 20 h after infection, cells were lysed directly in the culture wells (lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 1 mM MgSO4, SIGMAFAST protease inhibitor mix, 100 U ml−1 benzonase (Millipore Sigma)). Lysates were then spun down at 16,000g to remove particulates and the supernatant was mixed 1:1 with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 50 mg ml−1 DTT. Samples were then heated at 70 °C for 10 min and run on an SDS–PAGE gel (3%–8% Novex Tris-Acetate Gel, Invitrogen) at 150 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Bands were then transferred to PVDF membranes (100 V, 1 h at 4 °C) and blocked with 10% skim milk powder in TBST buffer at 4 °C overnight. Blots were probed sequentially with either mouse anti-actin (1.5 µg ml−1) or mouse anti-FANCD2 (0.1 µg ml−1) primary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog nos. MA511869 and MA123347), followed by a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog no. 115-035-003; 0.08 µg ml−1). Each probing step was conducted for 90 min at room temperature n 2.5% skim milk powder in TBST. Before imaging, blots were washed 3 times for 15 min each in TBST. Blots were imaged using the SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) kit following the manufacturer’s instructions and imaged using an Azure Biosystems c300 imager.
