Colibactin is a chemically unstable small-molecule genotoxin that is produced by several different bacteria, including members of the human gut microbiome1,2. Although the biological activity of colibactin has been extensively investigated in mammalian systems3, little is known about its effects on other microorganisms. Here we show that colibactin targets bacteria that contain prophages, and induces lytic development through the bacterial SOS response. DNA, added exogenously, protects bacteria from colibactin, as does expressing a colibactin resistance protein (ClbS) in non-colibactin-producing cells. The prophage-inducing effects that we observe apply broadly across different phage–bacteria systems and in complex communities. Finally, we identify bacteria that have colibactin resistance genes but lack colibactin biosynthetic genes. Many of these bacteria are infected with predicted prophages, and we show that the expression of their ClbS homologues provides immunity from colibactin-triggered induction. Our study reveals a mechanism by which colibactin production could affect microbiomes and highlights a role for microbial natural products in influencing population-level events such as phage outbreaks. The bacterial genotoxin colibactin triggers prophage-mediated lysis of neighbouring bacteria, a finding that provides insight into the dynamics of microbial communities and relationships between bacterial metabolite production and phage behaviour. Subject terms Main Main Microbial communities, including the human microbiome, are rich sources of bioactive natural products. However, the biological roles of natural products in these habitats are typically poorly understood. A bacterial natural product of particular relevance to human health is colibactin, a chemically reactive small-molecule genotoxin produced by gut bacteria that have a 54-kb hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) biosynthetic gene cluster known as the pks island (Fig. 1a). This gene cluster is predominantly found in human-associated strains of Escherichia coli that belong to phylogenetic group B2, but is also present in other human gut Enterobacteriaceae, as well as bacteria from the honey bee gut, a marine sponge and an olive tree knot4–6. Mechanistic studies have revealed that colibactin induces inter-strand DNA cross-links in vitro, causes cell-cycle arrest in eukaryotic cell culture and affects tumour formation in mouse models of colorectal cancer. Colibactin–DNA adducts have been detected in mammalian cells and in mice7, and studies have identified colibactin-associated mutational signatures in cancer genomes, predominantly from colorectal cancer8,9. Despite its important biological activity, colibactin has eluded traditional isolation and structural elucidation. Information regarding its chemical structure has largely been derived from bioinformatic analyses and biochemical characterization10–13. These studies suggest that colibactin has a pseudodimeric structure, with a reactive cyclopropane warhead at each end that accounts for its characteristic DNA-alkylating ability7,14,15 (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1Colibactin production specifically affects prophage-carrying bacteria.a, Biosynthetic organization and chemical structure of the genotoxic natural product colibactin.

Source data Source data In contrast to its effects on eukaryotic organisms, the effect of colibactin on the surrounding microbial community remains largely unknown. Previous studies have indicated that colibactin production may cause broad shifts in the composition of the gut microbial community in mice and inhibit the growth of a subset of staphylococci16,17. However, exposure to colibactin did not affect the growth of the vast majority (97%) of bacterial species tested, and the mechanism that underlies these effects has remained elusive. We aimed to shed additional light on the activity of colibactin and its potential ecological roles in microbial communities by studying its effects on bacteria. To begin, we exposed a laboratory strain of non-colibactin-producing (pks−) E. coli (BW25113) to supernatants from overnight cultures of colibactin-producing E. coli (a heterologous expression strain called BAC-pks; hereafter pks+). Culture supernatants did not inhibit the growth of the laboratory E. coli strain (Extended Data Fig. 1a), in line with analogous reports in mammalian cells1. To test whether growth inhibition requires the presence of live colibactin-producing cells, we co-cultured pks+
E. coli with pks−
E. coli carrying chromosomally distinguishable markers (lacZ) and monitored the growth of the two populations. When started at a 1:1 ratio, the proportion of pks+
E. coli did not change over the course of the experiment, and this outcome occurred irrespective of which strain carried the lacZ marker (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1b). These results suggest that, under the conditions tested, colibactin production by one bacterium does not inhibit the growth of an isogenic, non-producing strain.

Colibactin induces prophages Colibactin induces prophages Multiple lines of evidence suggest that bacteria should be susceptible to colibactin-mediated DNA damage. For example, the final gene in the pks gene cluster, clbS, encodes a self-resistance protein that is reported to hydrolyse and destroy the reactive cyclopropane warheads of colibactin18,19, and another gene, clbP, encodes a periplasmic peptidase that converts an inactive late-stage biosynthetic intermediate (precolibactin) to the final genotoxic metabolite in the periplasm before export20,21. Both bacterially encoded self-resistance mechanisms suggest that, like many toxic bacterial natural products, colibactin is potentially deleterious to non-producing bacteria. We next considered alternative consequences of colibactin-mediated DNA damage beyond inhibition of bacterial growth. One possible response of interest is phage induction. Specifically, it is known that DNA damage induced by ultraviolet irradiation or by chemical treatment (for example, mitomycin C (MMC)) activates lytic replication of prophages (a latent form of phage infection) in bacteria, killing the cell and potentially nucleating a phage epidemic within the larger microbial community22. We therefore wondered whether colibactin could affect bacterial populations by activating resident prophages.

We therefore wondered whether colibactin could affect bacterial populations by activating resident prophages. To test whether colibactin production alters the behaviour of prophages in neighbouring, non-colibactin-producing lysogens, we infected wild-type E. coli BW25113 with phage lambda and co-cultured this lysogen with pks+ or pks−
E. coli. Twenty-four hours of co-culture with the pks+ strain increased phage titres by orders of magnitude above those obtained with the pks− strain (Fig. 1c). Physical separation of colibactin producers from the lysogen via a 0.4-µm filter ablated this effect (Extended Data Fig. 1c), suggesting that cell–cell contact is required1. Consistent with the resident prophage being the responsible agent, no plaques were observed for any condition on ∆lamB E. coli, which lacks the lambda phage receptor (Fig. 1c). Finally, we verified that levels of colibactin production were not markedly altered between co-culture and monoculture conditions and were unaffected by the presence of the prophage-containing strain (Extended Data Fig. 1d). These results suggest that colibactin production specifically affects prophage-carrying bacteria by inducing lytic development.

These results suggest that colibactin production specifically affects prophage-carrying bacteria by inducing lytic development. Regulation of lambda induction from the prophage state occurs via a repressor protein (cI) that is inactivated by the host-encoded SOS response, for which RecA is a master regulator23. To test whether prophage induction by colibactin follows a similar sequence of events, we engineered a transcriptional reporter to track the lambda lysis–lysogeny decision by fusing the lambda immunity region to the luciferase operon (lux) on a plasmid (hereafter called PR-lux). Light production by luciferase therefore reports the transcriptional de-repression of phage lambda lytic replication, which is induced by known DNA-damaging-agents, such as MMC (Extended Data Fig. 1e). To examine the effect of colibactin in this system, we co-cultured E. coli harbouring PR-lux with pks+
or pks−
E. coli. The pks+ strain induced PR-lux in the reporter strain 40-fold compared to the pks− strain (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, the activating effect of both MMC and co-cultured pks+ cells was eliminated in ∆recA E. coli (Fig. 1d), showing that the transcriptional de-repression requires the canonical DNA-damage-inducible SOS response. Consistent with the active genotoxin being involved, deletion of the gene encoding the late-stage biosynthetic enzyme ClbP in the producing strain abolished the activation of PR-lux activity in co-cultured reporter cells and markedly reduced phage titres when co-cultured with the lambda lysogen (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Similar results were obtained using a native pks+ adherent-invasive colibactin-producing E. coli (NC101, which is used in mouse models of colorectal cancer carcinogenesis24) (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c, Supplementary Discussion). Finally, addition of extracellular DNA attenuated PR-lux activity and phage activation in a concentration-dependent, sequence-motif-specific manner (Extended Data Fig. 2d–h, Supplementary Discussion). Together, these data suggest that the ability to produce and transmit the final genotoxic product is important for the effect of colibactin on bacteria.

Together, these data suggest that the ability to produce and transmit the final genotoxic product is important for the effect of colibactin on bacteria. pks induces human-associated prophages pks induces human-associated prophages Given that bacteria frequently exist in polymicrobial communities, that prophages are pervasive in these communities and that the SOS response is highly conserved, we wondered whether the genotoxic effect of colibactin could extend to prophages that reside in phylogenetically distinct, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. To investigate this, we co-cultured pks+ or pks−
E. coli with multiple isolates of prophage-carrying Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.

Each phage–bacteria system resulted in a pks-dependent increase in prophage induction, as measured by enumerating plaque-forming units, antibody-based toxin detection and quantitative PCR (qPCR), showing that colibactin functions as a broad inducer (Fig. 2a–d).

Source data Source data Having experimentally demonstrated prophage induction in these bacteria under in vitro co-culture conditions, we next sought to test the action of colibactin in a setting that more closely resembles the complex multispecies environment of the gut. To achieve this, we anaerobically co-cultured pks+ or pks−
E. coli ex vivo with complex faecal microbiomes from C57BL/6J mice, to which we added the individual gut-associated bacteria from our above panel25 (S. Typhimurium, S. aureus, E. faecium and C. rodentium) (Fig. 2e). In all cases except for prophage BTP1 from the S. Typhimurium polylysogen, we observed an increase in phage or toxin production within the pks+ communities relative to the pks− communities (Fig. 2f–h). The lack of pks-dependent induction for BTP1—which is possibly due to the high degree of spontaneous induction in anaerobic communities—is notable given the significant induction observed under the same conditions for Gifsy-1, which is co-harboured by the same host bacterium. Together, these results demonstrate that colibactin-producing bacteria induce prophages in human- and gut-relevant strains and in complex microbial communities.

However, unlike MMC, in which self-protection to the producing organism is thought to require the combined action of multiple resistance proteins26,27, protection from colibactin exposure in pks+ organisms involves one 170-amino-acid resistance protein, ClbS18,19 (Fig. 1a). Studies using genetic deletions of clbS found that colibactin producers deficient for ClbS are viable, but that their growth depends on RecA, indicating that DNA repair mechanisms are needed for growth18 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Acquisition of clbS would therefore be a potential strategy for susceptible community members to protect themselves against the effects of colibactin. We thus wondered whether clbS-like genes exist in closely related, non-colibactin-producing bacteria, and whether the function of these genes may alter phage–host dynamics in response to colibactin. To gain insight into its context, we performed a bioinformatic search (tBLASTn) for genes that encode proteins with amino acid sequences identical to that of E. coli ClbS. In 97% of the examined hits (230 total; Supplementary Table 1), the clbS homologue was found in a pks gene cluster with the same genetic organization as that of known colibactin-producing strains. In the seven cases (3%) in which clbS was not associated with an intact pks gene cluster, the gene normally encoded upstream of clbS—clbQ—was present but truncated, and both genes were surrounded by predicted transposase-associated genes (Extended Data Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 1), indicating that the region may be subject to horizontal transfer. This search, consistent with a recent report28, reveals that the clbS gene found in pks+
E. coli also exists in isolates of the same species that lack a pks gene cluster. Our results predict that colibactin, like MMC, is a generally effective inducer of prophages.

E. coli also exists in isolates of the same species that lack a pks gene cluster. To test whether expression of ClbS in non-colibactin-producing E. coli can provide protection from colibactin exposure, we introduced and expressed plasmid-encoded clbS (from pks+
E. coli, pTrc-clbS) in a pks− strain harbouring either the PR-lux reporter or phage lambda (Extended Data Fig. 3c). When co-cultured with pks+
E. coli, the reporter strain harbouring the clbS expression vector prevented PR-lux reporter activity, whereas the same reporter strain transformed with pTrc-∆clbS did not (Extended Data Fig. 3d). ClbS did not inhibit PR-lux reporter activity when MMC was used as the inducing agent, suggesting that protection is specific to colibactin (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Moreover, supernatants from ClbS-expressing cells did not provide protection against colibactin, indicating that ClbS-based resistance is intracellular and not shared between cells (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Consistent with the reporter activity, the lambda lysogen harbouring pTrc-clbS yielded 1,000-fold fewer phage particles than the same lysogen carrying pTrc-∆clbS when co-cultured with pks+
E. coli (Extended Data Fig. 3g). The pTrc-clbS construct also repressed the induction of phage P22 when introduced into S. Typhimurium, indicating that this resistance mechanism is functional beyond E. coli (Extended Data Fig. 3g).

We next sought to examine whether clbS-like genes exist in more distantly related bacteria that lack the pks gene cluster; and, if so, whether they also have a protective function in this context. Hypothesizing that organisms that are found in close proximity with colibactin producers would benefit from colibactin resistance, we searched for more distant ClbS homologues (50% amino acid identity cut-off) in the genomes of bacteria from two specific niches in which pks encoders are reported to exist: the human gastrointestinal tract and the honey bee gut5,29. We found multiple clbS-like genes in pks− human-associated bacteria, including Escherichia albertii 07-3866, Kluyvera intestini and Metakosakonia sp. MRY16-398, the latter two of which were isolated from patients with gastric cancer and patients with sigmoid colon diverticulitis, respectively30,31. We also identified a clbS-like gene in Snodgrasella alvi, a pks− core member of the honey bee gut32 (Extended Data Fig. 4a).

To assess whether these homologues could protect against colibactin-induced phage lysis, we heterologously expressed a subset of the identified ClbS-like proteins in the E. coli lambda lysogen or reporter strain and co-cultured these bacteria with pks+
E. coli. All four ClbS-like proteins attenuated DNA damage and prophage induction, both in terms of reporter output and plaques produced, suggesting the potential for the bacteria harbouring these genes to be protected from colibactin (Fig. 3a). Removing the niche-specific criteria and further lowering the cut-off in our search led us to uncover a wider range of ClbS-like proteins (25–80% amino acid identity relative to E. coli ClbS), an additional six of which we chose as a representative panel for heterologous expression and evaluation in our assays (Extended Data Fig. 4a). A summary of all ClbS-like proteins identified in our search is presented in Supplementary Table 1 (BLASTp 5,000 hits; Methods). Every ClbS-like protein tested in our panel provided protection against colibactin-induced DNA damage and prophage induction (Fig. 3a). Collectively, these results show that protection from colibactin can be gained through distantly related ClbS-like proteins that are found in bacteria that lack all other pks genes.Fig. 3ClbS and ClbS-like proteins from diverse bacteria provide protection against colibactin-activated prophage induction.a, Plaque assay (images, left) and PR-lux reporter output (bar graph, right) obtained from pks+

Source data Source data Resistance as a phage-silencing strategy Resistance as a phage-silencing strategy To investigate the effect of colibactin resistance on prophage induction in non-colibactin-producing bacteria, we focused on two human-associated clbS+ organisms from our panel: Metakosakonia sp. MRY16-398 and E. albertii 07-3866, both of which harbour predicted DNA-damage-responsive prophages (Extended Data Fig. 4b–d, Supplementary Discussion). In Metakosakonia sp. MRY16-398, one of the predicted prophages corresponds to an uncharacterized 40-kb element. We synthesized a region of approximately 1 kb from this Metakosakonia prophage, encompassing the putative immunity region (containing a possible cI-like repressor; Supplementary Discussion), and fused the counter-oriented promoter to lux on a plasmid, called PMetako-lux (Fig. 3b). When introduced into recA+
E. coli, the activity of PMetako-lux was activated both by MMC and by co-culture with pks+
E. coli (Fig. 3c), suggesting its DNA damage inducibility. Next, to determine whether the clbS-like gene encoded by Metakosakonia sp. MRY16-398 (clbSMetako) affects induction of the Metakosakonia phage, we introduced plasmid-based clbSMetako into the reporter strain (resulting in PMetako-lux + pTrc-clbSMetako). We found that MMC continued to activate reporter expression, whereas co-culture with pks+
E. coli did not (Fig. 3c). Although we could not obtain an isolate of Metakosakonia MRY16-398 for these investigations, the results predict that if the ClbS protein is expressed in this Metakosakonia host, the organism will be resistant to the prophage-inducing effects of colibactin.

As another example, we turned to an available human-associated clbS+ isolate of E. albertii (Fig. 3d). Escherichia albertii 07-3866 was isolated from human faeces33, encodes a ClbS homologue that is unique from those of Metakosakonia sp. MRY16-398 and pks+
E. coli (Extended Data Fig. 4a), and harbours multiple predicted prophages (Extended Data Fig. 4c). When exposed to MMC, lysates of E. albertii 07-3866 cultures formed distinct plaques on E. coli, indicating that E. albertii 07-3866 harbours a DNA-damage-inducible prophage (Fig. 3e). In contrast to treatment with MMC, co-culture of E. albertii 07-3866 with pks+
E. coli did not lead to plaque formation (Fig. 3e). We investigated whether the failure of this strain to produce phages specifically during pks+ co-culture could be explained by the expression of E. albertii ClbS. Escherichia albertii is related to E. coli, and the region that surrounds clbS in the E. albertii 07-3866 genome is highly conserved in E. coli (around 90% nucleotide identity in an approximately 18-kb vicinity). We transferred the clbS locus from E. albertii to the same relative location in the pks−
E. coli genome. As shown in Fig. 3f, when co-cultured with pks+
E. coli, pks−
E. coli harbouring the chromosomally integrated E. albertii clbS exhibited a reduction of approximately 50% in PR-lux reporter activity relative to the unprotected, wild-type clbS− strain. The results of these experiments suggest that native clbS expression levels in E. albertii are sufficient to attenuate colibactin-specific prophage induction. More generally, our data from both Metakosakonia sp. and E. albertii lead us to propose that clbS+ organisms are protected from colibactin-mediated prophage induction. These results also imply that the acquisition of orphan clbS genes is an effective strategy for prophage-carrying bacteria to resist the production of colibactin by neighbouring community members.

Discussion Discussion The knowledge that colibactin induces prophages in diverse bacteria, combined with the finding that non-colibactin-producing bacteria from distinct environmental origins have functional clbS-like genes, leads us to speculate that colibactin production is more widespread than currently recognized, and that this genotoxin is likely to have evolved to target bacteria rather than a mammalian host. So far, studies of colibactin have primarily focused on its role in carcinogenesis, but this activity raises important questions with regard to the evolutionary role of the toxin for the producing bacterium. Colibactin genes have also been implicated in siderophore biosynthesis and microcin export, suggesting that these factors may collectively be involved in bacterial competition34,35. Although other functions of colibactin may exist, our discovery that it induces prophages provides one mechanism by which production of and immunity to this natural product might confer a competitive advantage over other microorganisms. For example, because cell lysis is an irreversible consequence of prophage induction22, this mechanism could explain a previously reported observation of pks-dependent growth inhibition of a subset of S. aureus strains, a bacterium with an evolutionary history shaped by phage activity17,36 (Supplementary Discussion). Moreover, the broad-spectrum activity of colibactin in inducing prophages across distinct bacteria suggests that this natural product could have effects on many members of a community, potentially accounting for colibactin-associated changes in the composition of the gut microbiome that have previously been observed in animal models16. Beyond bacteria, our observation that exposure to colibactin increases the production of Stx in mixed communities hints at mechanisms by which this natural product could affect host health and highlights how inducing prophages may regulate other behaviours within the microbial community.

Our study underscores major gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie prophage induction in microbiomes. MMC and ultraviolet light are the most common methods of activating prophage induction in the laboratory; however, the ecologically relevant triggers for prophages found in natural environments remain largely unidentified. Previous work has shown that the human gut commensal bacterium, Lactobacillus reuteri, harbours a prophage that undergoes induction during gastrointestinal transit in response to dietary fructose and short-chain fatty acids37. In the vaginal community, metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene—a constituent of tobacco smoke—and subsequent secretion in the vagina induces multiple Lactobacillus prophages38. In the nasal microbial community, hydrogen-peroxide-producing Streptococcus has been shown to selectively eliminate prophage-carrying S. aureus39. Unlike benzo[a]pyrene, which humans encounter through outside exposures, and hydrogen peroxide, which has a wide range of biological targets and proposed functions, colibactin is a complex natural product produced by human gut bacteria. By uncovering the phage-inducing activity of colibactin-producing bacteria, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which colibactin and potentially other DNA-damaging natural products may shape microbial communities. More generally, the modulation of phage behaviours represents a distinct and underappreciated ecological role for microbial natural products. Our findings add to this growing understanding14,40–43 and, notably, demonstrate phage induction by a natural product in co-culture. Finally, as links between the human gut virome and diseases continue to be established44, our findings set the stage for further investigations of how gut bacterial metabolite production modulates phage behaviours and may influence human disease.

Detection of Stx2dact from both aerobic co-cultures and faecal communities was performed using the Premier EHEC test kit, which specifically detects Shiga toxins I and II (Meridian Biosciences), following the manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications: for aerobic co-cultures, overnight monocultures of C. rodentium harbouring stx2dact were back-diluted 1:100 and co-cultured in M9-CAS at a 1:1 ratio with E. coli BW25113 harbouring either BAC-pks or the empty BAC. For faecal community experiments, anaerobic monocultures of C. rodentium harbouring stx2dact were mixed with faecal communities in BHI as described in the relevant section below. To verify toxin production in response to a known DNA-damaging agent under these conditions, MMC (1.5 µg ml−1 final concentration) was added to aerobic cultures of exponentially growing stx2dact-harbouring C. rodentium in M9-CAS. In all cases, samples collected after 24-h incubations (exact volumes detailed below) were diluted in 200 µl of diluent buffer provided by the manufacturer before addition to Stx-specific antibody-coated microwells. The use of kit-provided positive and negative controls as well as all wash and substrate addition steps were carried out exactly according to the manufacturer-supplied protocol. The stop reagent was added approximately 2–5 min after adding the final substrate to each well, at which time the images used in Fig. 3c were taken. Absorbance at 450 nm (Abs450 nm) was measured using a plate-reader. According to the manufacturer, Abs450 nm values ≥ 0.180 are considered a positive test result. For aerobic experiments including MMC controls, 2 µl of culture supernatants were used as the sample input. For faecal community experiments, culture supernatants were first concentrated approximately 20-fold from the initial volume in protein concentrators (Pierce, 30 kDa MWCO, spin columns).

The mass spectrometer system consists of a triple quadrupole equipped with a dual-spray electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Samples were analysed using an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (2.7 mm, 4.6 mm × 50 mm) with the following elution conditions: isocratic hold at 90% solvent A in solvent B for 0.5 min: linear gradient from 90% to 5% solvent A in solvent B from 0.5–2 min; isocratic hold at 5% solvent A from 2–3 min, gradient from 5% to 98% solvent A in solvent B from 3–3.5 min; isocratic hold at 98% solvent A in solvent B from 3.5–4 min (solvent A: 95% water + 5% methanol + 0.03% ammonium hydroxide; solvent B: 80% isopropanol + 15% methanol + 5% water; flow rate = 0.75 ml min−1; injection volume = 5 µl).

In d, domain analysis was used to predict the cI-like repressor (maroon genes) on the basis that it harbours a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (blue, N-terminal domain) and a LexA-like, S24 peptidase domain (pink, C-terminal domain). The same two-domain architecture is found in the lambda cI repressor protein and confers an autoproteolytic mechanism in which the repressor is cleaved in the presence of a DNA-damage-induced, RecA-active protein complex, leading to phage lysis.
