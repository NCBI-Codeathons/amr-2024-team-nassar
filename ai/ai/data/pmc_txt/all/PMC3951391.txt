Lantibiotic compounds are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides against which bacteria are not able to produce resistance, hence making them a good alternative to antibiotics. Nisin is the oldest and the most widely used lantibiotic, in food preservation, without having developed any significant resistance against it. Having their antimicrobial potential and a limited number, there is a need to identify novel lantibiotics. Frequent use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.

Methodology/Findings Methodology/Findings Identification of novel lantibiotic biosynthetic clusters from an ever increasing database of bacterial genomes, can provide a major lead in this direction. In order to achieve this, a strategy was adopted to identify novel lantibiotic biosynthetic clusters by screening the sequenced genomes for LanT homolog, which is a conserved lantibiotic transporter specific to type IB clusters. This strategy resulted in identification of 54 bacterial strains containing the LanT homologs, which are not the known lantibiotic producers. Of these, 24 strains were subjected to a detailed bioinformatic analysis to identify genes encoding for precursor peptides, modification enzyme, immunity and quorum sensing proteins. Eight clusters having two LanM determinants, similar to haloduracin and lichenicidin were identified, along with 13 clusters having a single LanM determinant as in mersacidin biosynthetic cluster. Besides these, orphan LanT homologs were also identified which might be associated with novel bacteriocins, encoded somewhere else in the genome. Three identified gene clusters had a C39 domain containing LanT transporter, associated with the LanBC proteins and double glycine type precursor peptides, the only known example of such a cluster is that of salivaricin.

Introduction Introduction Antibiotic compounds are in use for many decades in treating various bacterial infections and their continuous use has led to the development of drug resistant bacterial strains [1]. MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus), VRE (vancomycin resistant Enterococci), MDR-TB (multi drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and MDR-SP (Streptococcus pneumoniae) are some of the antibiotic resistant bacterial strains that are difficult to treat, therefore posing a need for new antimicrobial compounds. Lantibiotics are emerging as more promising drugs against these bacteria. Nisin was the first “lantibiotic” discovered from Lactococcus lactis
[2] and is being used in food preservation since then due to its broad activity against many food spoiling and pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococci, Staphylococci and Streptococci. More than 40 years of its use in food industry has not led to any significant resistance [3], justifying the need and importance of study on lantibiotics.

More than 40 years of its use in food industry has not led to any significant resistance [3], justifying the need and importance of study on lantibiotics. Lantibiotics are Lanthionine containing antibiotics having a characteristic lanthionine ring responsible for their stability. The lanthionine ring is formed by dehydration and cyclization in the core peptide region of a 50–100 amino acid residues long precursor peptide from which the N-terminal leader peptide is cleaved off. The serine and threonine residues are dehydrated to form didehydroalanine (Dha) and didehydrobutyrine (Dhb) residues, respectively. Following dehydration, cyclization occurs by linking cysteine to Dha or Dhb residues thus forming a thioether linkage called as lanthionine or β-methyllanthionine. Lantibiotics exhibit their antibacterial activity by capturing lipid II precursor of peptidoglycan, thus, inhibiting cell wall formation [4], or by pore formation which leads to leakage and disruption of the membrane potential [5]. Nisin exhibits both of these activities. The leader peptide of lantibiotics helps in the recognition and interaction of lanthipeptide with different enzymes of its biosynthetic machinery [6], [7]. It is the leader peptide which keeps the lantibiotic inactive, when present inside the cell [7], [8] and is also required for its extracellular transport [9], [10]. Lantibiotic biosynthetic machinery is organized into gene clusters, in single or multiple operons encoding the precursor peptide(s), modification enzymes, immunity proteins, a protease and a transporter. Following post-translational modifications, the lanthipeptide is exported outside the cell by an ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter and the leader peptide is cleaved off by a protease. The cleavage is either concomitant with the export [11] or after the transport, by an extracellular protease that may (e.g. nisin) or may not (e.g. subtilin) be encoded in the cluster [12], [13]. Due to a diversity in the lantibiotic compounds, several classification schemes have been proposed [14]–[17]. The widely used bacteriocin mining tool, BAGEL2 [18] is based upon the classification given by Cotter et al., who have classified the lantibiotics into two major classes. Class I lantibiotics includes lanthionine containing lantibiotics and class II includes small non-lanthionine bacteriocins. Class I lantibiotics are further classified into three subgroups [19]. Type IA lantibiotics like nisin [20] and microbisporicin [21] are modified by two separate enzymes LanB and LanC. LanB is responsible for the dehydration of selective serine and threonine residues in the core peptide region and LanC for cyclization leading to lanthionine formation. Type IA precursor peptides have a highly conserved proline at -2 position, which is a characteristic of LanBC modified precursor peptides. In Type IB clusters, lanthionine formation is carried out by a single LanM protein, which carries out both the dehydration and cyclization. Type IC lantibiotics are also modified by a single protein, LanL [22]. In most of the class I clusters, besides the precursor peptide and lanthionine synthetases, a two-component response regulator system (LanRK) is present, same as in quorum sensing, for concentration dependent biosynthesis of the lantibiotic [23]. To ensure that the producer organism is not affected by its own lantibiotic, immunity proteins LanI, LanF, LanE and LanG are also present which provide self-resistance. LanI is a lipoprotein and LanFEG are ABC transporters, which pump the lantibiotic outside, thus, preventing from self-damage [24], [25].

LanI is a lipoprotein and LanFEG are ABC transporters, which pump the lantibiotic outside, thus, preventing from self-damage [24], [25]. Type IB lantibiotic cluster can further be either a single or two-component lantibiotic encoding cluster. Single component lantibiotics like mersacidin [26] and lacticin 481 [8] have a single antimicrobial peptide. The two-component lantibiotics like haloduracin [27], [28] and lichenicidin [29], [30] consist of two peptides designated as α and β peptides, which show antimicrobial activity through a synergistic effect. The two peptides are highly antimicrobial together but show little or no activity separately. In case of two-component lantibiotic, where the two precursor peptides show high sequence identity, like in case of cytolysin (i.e. 43%) from Enterococcus faecalis
[31], there is a single LanM to process both the precursor peptides (
Table 1
). In examples where the precursor peptides show low sequence identity, like 17% in case of lichenicidin [29] and 12% in haloduracin [27], two separate LanM enzymes process the respective precursor peptides. Some unique clusters have also been identified which contain more than two precursor peptides for a single LanM. For, example, upto 29 precursor peptides (with 37–84% sequence identity) have been identified in Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313, of which 17 were experimentally found to be processed by a single LanM only [32], showing the highly promiscuous nature of the LanM.

Here, we adopted a strategy of using HalT transporter as a query sequence to identify novel type IB lantibiotic clusters by microbial genome database mining. The strategy resulted in identification of 54 strains, from the top 72 hits that were encoding novel HalT homologs in the genome. Out of these 54 strains, we could identify 24 novel lantibiotic clusters that were encoding genes for precursor peptides, modification enzyme, quorum sensing, transport and immunity.

Results Results Using LanT as a mining tool, an in silico approach was followed to identify novel type IB lantibiotic clusters in bacterial genome. LanT is a conserved C39 peptidase domain containing lantibiotic transporter and is an integral part of the Type IB clusters i.e. clusters encoding LanM and double glycine motif containing precursor peptide(s). HalT protein of haloduracin biosynthetic cluster [27], [28] was selected as a driver sequence for PSI-BLAST search of the NCBI database. The top 72 hits obtained had a significantly low e-value (<6e-127) including those involved in the production of the lantibiotics like lichenicidin, g_sp_G11MC16, geobacillin, salivaricin (
Table 2
), and some putative lantibiotic clusters [18], [30], [36], thus, proving the effectiveness of our mining approach. Besides the proven ones, 59 novel LanT homologs were identified in 54 bacterial strains (having 34–50% identity with HalT), among the representatives of actinobacteria, firmicutes, cyanobacteria, proteobacteria and chloroflexi, which have not been documented earlier for having any association with the lantibiotic production (
Table 2
). Out of the 54 strains, we could identify 24 novel lantibiotic clusters. In rest of the strains, the identified HalT homolog was either orphan or a complete cluster could not be established. All these 24 clusters are discussed here and the identified lantibiotic precursor peptide sequences are given in detail (Table S1) along with their ClustalW alignment (
Fig. 1

The draft genome sequence of S. roseosporus, revealed a cluster (

The precursor peptides had 37% identity, which was intermediate between haloduracin (22%) and cytolysin precursor peptides (∼43%), that are processed by two and single LanM, respectively (

In order to have an idea of the relation between the percent identity among the precursor peptides and the number of LanMs that can process them, the putative precursor peptides identified in this biosynthetic cluster were compared with those of the well-known lantibiotics, for their identity score (

In case of prochlorococcins also, a single LanM has been shown to process 17 out of 29 proposed precursor peptides, having 37–84% identity [32]. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that with an intermediate identity of 37%, they would be processed by a single LanM, thus, marking a probable threshold value in the identity of precursor peptides, in light of the examples of experimentally proven lanthipeptides.

It is an aerobic mesophilic terrestrial bacterium. The genomic annotation of S. hygroscopicus showed the LanM determinant (SSOG_05509, 22% identical to HalM) as conserved hypothetical protein, LanT determinant (SSOG_05511) as the lantibiotic transporter, and two putative precursor peptides (SSOG_05508 and 10) as the hypothetical proteins. Since, the sequence identity among these putative precursor peptides was very low i.e. 7% (

Streptomyces bingchenggensis BCW-1 Streptomyces bingchenggensis BCW-1 Streptomyces bingchenggensis BCW-1 Streptomyces bingchenggensis BCW-1 S. bingchenggensis is a soil bacterium isolated from Harbin, China. It produces milbemycins (commercially important anthelmintic macrolide compounds), other insecticidal antibiotics, and a few cyclic pentapeptides and is thus interesting for its secondary metabolite producing capabilities [39]. Our genome analysis of S. bingchenggensis resulted in the identification of a cluster (
Fig. 2
) consisting of a LanM determinant (SBI_06988; 18% identical to HalM) and two putative precursor peptides (SBI_06989 and 90), that were originally annotated as hypothetical proteins, and a LanT homolog (SBI_06987) of ∼1600 amino acid residues, annotated as cytolysin B transport protein. The size of LanT appeared large enough, for it to be just a transport protein (
Table 3
). Also the precursor peptides were found to have an identity of 20% among themselves, which being very low (
Table 1
), suggested that the cluster should have two LanMs [27]. Phylogenetic analysis (
Fig. 3
) also suggested that this cluster might encode for a two-component lantibiotic cluster. Using CDD, we could identify a second LanM, fused with the C39 protease and the ABC transporter domain, in this large protein sequence (
Fig. 4
). Though the cluster was also analyzed by BAGEL2, it predicted this single ORF as LanM and could not identify the hidden transporter. It will be interesting to know with wet lab experiments, if this tri-domain protein is operative in the formation of an active lantibiotic. When this long putative transporter sequence was subjected to BLAST, no other similar example could be identified on NCBI Entrez database.

The second LanM could only be identified by using a consolidation of BLAST, CDD and BAGEL2, as it was fused with the LanT. S. bingchenggensis is a soil bacterium isolated from Harbin, China. It produces milbemycins (commercially important anthelmintic macrolide compounds), other insecticidal antibiotics, and a few cyclic pentapeptides and is thus interesting for its secondary metabolite producing capabilities [39]. Our genome analysis of S. bingchenggensis resulted in the identification of a cluster (
Fig. 2
) consisting of a LanM determinant (SBI_06988; 18% identical to HalM) and two putative precursor peptides (SBI_06989 and 90), that were originally annotated as hypothetical proteins, and a LanT homolog (SBI_06987) of ∼1600 amino acid residues, annotated as cytolysin B transport protein. The size of LanT appeared large enough, for it to be just a transport protein (
Table 3
). Also the precursor peptides were found to have an identity of 20% among themselves, which being very low (
Table 1
), suggested that the cluster should have two LanMs [27]. Phylogenetic analysis (
Fig. 3
) also suggested that this cluster might encode for a two-component lantibiotic cluster. Using CDD, we could identify a second LanM, fused with the C39 protease and the ABC transporter domain, in this large protein sequence (
Fig. 4
). Though the cluster was also analyzed by BAGEL2, it predicted this single ORF as LanM and could not identify the hidden transporter. It will be interesting to know with wet lab experiments, if this tri-domain protein is operative in the formation of an active lantibiotic. When this long putative transporter sequence was subjected to BLAST, no other similar example could be identified on NCBI Entrez database.

The precursor peptides processed by LanBC proteins generally have a proline at -2 position, but here instead, double glycine motif was present. Noteworthy here is the presence of as many as eight cysteine residues of the total sixteen modifiable residues in the core peptide region (

This culture is of special interest because it was the first cultivated representative of a deep branching unclassified lineage of otherwise uncultivated environmental phylotypes, tentatively located within the phylum ‘chloroflexi’ [42]. The draft genome sequence of K. racemifer revealed the presence of a lantibiotic biosynthetic cluster (
Fig. 7
) with as many as ten putative precursor peptides (Krac_11033, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 47 and 50), two LanM determinants (Krac_11032 and 36, showing 30% and 27% identity with HalM) and the LanT homolog (Krac_11043). A second LanT homolog (Krac_11909; not shown) not associated with any lantibiotic precursor peptide was also present in the genome. Since there are two LanMs present in the cluster, so it was expected that the phylogenetic analysis would distribute the putative precursor peptides among the two clades of α and β precursors. Instead, the precursor peptides formed a separate group, unrelated with α and β precursor peptides (

Discussion Discussion Discussion Genome mining is being extensively and successfully done these days using bioinformatic tools, to identify novel genes and gene clusters. Recently, many lantibiotic biosynthetic clusters have been identified using microbial genome database mining approach, by taking advantage of the conserved nature of the genes encoded in the lantibiotic clusters. For example, LanC has been used as a query for the identification of type IA lantibiotic clusters [43], LanM for type IB clusters [30], [44], C39 protease domain for double glycine motif containing precursor peptides [45] and recently HylD and LanT was used for the identification of bacteriocins in cyanobacteria [44]. In the present study, a similar approach was followed to identify novel lantibiotic biosynthetic clusters. HalT transporter of haloduracin biosynthetic cluster was taken as a query to screen the bacterial genomes on NCBI Entrez. HalT has a N-terminal C39 protease and a C-terminal ABC-transporter, for haloduracin precursor peptides. This strategy resulted in the identification of 59 novel LanT homologs in 54 bacterial genomes (more than one in a single genome; 
Table 2
). The detailed characterization of all these LanT homologs and the nearby genome sequence, led to the identification of 24 novel lantibiotic clusters, described here. The bacteria encoding these clusters were the representatives of actinobacteria, firmicutes, cyanobacteria, proteobacteria and chloroflexi.

HalT transporter of haloduracin biosynthetic cluster was taken as a query to screen the bacterial genomes on NCBI Entrez. HalT has a N-terminal C39 protease and a C-terminal ABC-transporter, for haloduracin precursor peptides. This strategy resulted in the identification of 59 novel LanT homologs in 54 bacterial genomes (more than one in a single genome; 
Table 2
). The detailed characterization of all these LanT homologs and the nearby genome sequence, led to the identification of 24 novel lantibiotic clusters, described here. The bacteria encoding these clusters were the representatives of actinobacteria, firmicutes, cyanobacteria, proteobacteria and chloroflexi. Many examples of actinobacteria have been reported earlier for producing lantibiotics [46]. This study led to the identification of five more actinobacteria (
Fig. 2
) encoding lantibiotic clusters namely S. hygroscopicus ATCC 53653, S. bingchenggensis BCW-1, S. viridochromogenes DSM 40736, S. roseosporus NRRL 11379 and Mycobacterium tusciae JS617. The three actinobacteria, ATCC 53653, BCW-1 and DSM 40736 were found encoding a putative two-component lantibiotic cluster, as suggested by the phylogenetic analysis of the precursor peptides (
Fig. 3
) and the presence of two LanMs. In ATCC 53653, the ORF encoding a second LanM was missed out in the genomic annotation while in BCW-1, it was hidden and fused with the LanT homolog (
Fig. 4
). It was only the sequence identity among the precursor peptides (7% and 20%), that gave us a clue for the possible presence of a second LanM. To draw a relation between the sequence identity among the precursor peptides and number of LanMs that are required for the processing, examples of already known and putative lantibiotic clusters were taken and analysed (
Table 1
). We could conclude therefrom that for upto 20% sequence identity, two LanMs are required for processing of the precursor peptides and above 37% identity, a single LanM is sufficient. Many examples of actinobacteria have been reported earlier for producing lantibiotics [46]. This study led to the identification of five more actinobacteria (

A majority of known lantibiotics are produced by firmicutes [46]. In this study, we have identified seven strains of Bacillus cereus (
Fig. 5
) namely FRI-35, VD107, MSX-A1, SJ1, VD045, VD166 and Rock1–3, encoding novel lantibiotic clusters with a diversity in the sequence of the precursor peptides. Earlier, Xiong et al had identified a cluster containing six identical precursor peptides in another strain of B. cereus Q1, which were named as cereicidins [36]. Other firmicutes that were identified included the anaerobic bacteria: R. flavifaciens FD-1 and C. bescii DSM 6725; facultative anaerobe: S. epidermidis and aerobic bacteria: C. perfringens, Bacillus Str. ATCC 3626, Bacillis sp. 7_6_55CFAA_CT2. The strains FRI-35, FD-1 and 7_6_55CFAA_CT2 were found encoding a putative two-component lantibiotic cluster. FRI-35 was found to be encoding 8 and FD-1 as 12 precursor peptides, this being maximum in any firmicute identified till date, although multiple precursor peptides encoding clusters have been identified earlier in cyanobacteria [32], [44] and chloroflexi [30]. The lantibiotic clusters identified in the firmicutes, FRI-35 and S. epidermidis were found on plasmids, like the previously characterized lantibiotics cytolysin, nisin, salivaricin etc. A majority of known lantibiotics are produced by firmicutes [46].

The lantibiotic clusters identified in the firmicutes, FRI-35 and S. epidermidis were found on plasmids, like the previously characterized lantibiotics cytolysin, nisin, salivaricin etc. Nine of the previously genetically characterized type IB clusters [46] and four of the clusters identified here in actinobacteria, completely rely on a bifunctional LanT. However, in six of the identified firmicutes, an additional LanP protease was found encoded in the cluster, namely in FRI-35, MSX-A1, SJ1, VD045 (
Fig. 5
), 7_6_55CFAA_CT2 and S. epidermidis (
Fig. 6
). The presence of two proteases in a single cluster suggests that there might be more than one cleavage site on the same precursor peptide [44]. While LanT processes and transports a precursor peptide with double glycine motif, the LanP is a membrane bound extracellular protease [20], which acts on the N-terminus of the P(QRS) motif of the precursor peptides. The latter motifs were found present in the leader region of the precursor peptides (Text S1) before the double glycine motif in the strains FRI-35, MSX-A1 and SJ1 while in VD045, it was present in the core peptide region. In 7_6_55CFAA_CT2 and S. epidermidis, the motif was not identified. So, it will be interesting to know how the presence of both the proteases fit into the sequence of events in lantibiotic biosynthesis.

In 2009, Begley et al reported the presence of lantibiotic clusters by in-silico analysis in the representatives of cyanobacteria, chloroflexi and proteobacteria, which had not been associated with lantibiotic production earlier [30]. Later, it was experimentally confirmed in cyanobacteria [32]. Thereafter, Wang et al reported the widespread occurrence of bacteriocin gene clusters in cyanobacteria, suggesting the phyla to be a prolific source of bacteriocins [44]. Here, we have added two more representatives of cyanobacteria; Synechocystis sp. PCC 7509 and a new genus Chamaesiphon minutus PCC 6605 (
Fig. 7
), both encoding a putative two-component lantibiotic cluster (

To the best of our knowledge, salivaricin is the only known example where the double glycine type precursor peptide is modified by LanBC (instead of LanM), processed and transported by a bifunctional LanT [47]. In our study, similar biosynthetic clusters were identified in an actinomycete, M. tusciae JS617 (

Fig. 2

) and in proteobacteria, C. coralloides DSM 2259 and C. fuscus DSM 2262 (

Fig. 7

). LanBC enzymes usually process the precursor peptides, which have a conserved proline at -2 position and FNLD motif around the position -20 and -15 in the leader, thus playing a crucial role in the post-translational modification [48]. Experimental evidences are therefore required to conclude that without the presence of these crucial motifs, as has been noticed in the above three clusters, the identified precursor peptides could still undergo post-translational modification by LanBC.

Many different kinds of post-translational modifications, other than the lanthionine formation have been reported recently in bacteriocins [41], [49]. In the present study, besides the normal genes present in the lantibiotic cluster, some additional atypical genes were found like NADPH dependent FMN reductase in SJ1, VD045, C. bescii DSM 6725 and C. perfringens B str. ATCC 3626 and N-acetyltransferases were found in close proximity to the clusters in DSM 6725 and ATCC 53653. These atypical genes might be involved in additional post-translational modifications of the lantibiotics. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is believed to protect the proteins from degradation [50] and, thus, might provide an additional stability to the encoded lantibiotic, besides that by the lanthionine group.

Many of the previous, putatively [30] and experimentally characterized lantibiotics including nisin have been identified on transmissible genetic elements. Here also, the clusters identified in B. cereus VD045, B. cereus Rock1–3 and K. racemifer DSM 44963 were present in close proximity with the transposable genetic elements, which might be involved in mobilizing the cluster to other species and also for their mobility within the genome.

From several studies done on lantibiotics, it has been felt that the search for smaller antimicrobial peptides is difficult because of their small size and low homology, and are therefore missed out during the conventional genomic annotation. However, the relatively larger transporter gene of the lantibiotic biosynthetic cluster i.e. LanT is rarely unannotated and can be identified by BLAST search. The in silico analysis of the nearby region for the lantibiotic modification genes can then lead to the identification of the precursor peptides. Thus, identifying lanthipeptides using conserved regions of the larger proteins of the lantibiotic biosynthetic cluster proves out to be a better approach. The putative lantibiotic clusters identified here using the above said strategy is a major expansion to the already reported putative lantibiotics, and if taken for focussed wet lab experiments, it might expand our library of antimicrobial peptides against the drug resistant pathogens. The identified bacteria can be taken up for in vivo production of the lantibiotic or an in vitro reconstitution approach can be adopted. Some findings like the presence of LanBC modification enzymes for processing peptides with double glycine motif, fusion of the modification enzyme with the transporter and presence of unrelated genes like the FMN reductases and N-acetyltransferases in the lantibiotic biosysnthetic cluster organization has further pointed towards the need of experimental characterization of these lantibiotic biosynthetic systems. The use of BAGEL2 poses limitations in identification of the whole biosynthetic cluster that can be overcome by a consolidation of well established analytical bioinformatic tools used here. In nutshell, our results provide a higher level of confidence in the novel identified clusters, to proceed for wet lab experiments, for the discovery of novel lantibiotic(s).
