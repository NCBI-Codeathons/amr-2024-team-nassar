Rosa roxburghii Tratt. has been reported to be a botanical source of antimicrobial compounds, which may represent a promising candidate for screening endophytic fungi with antimicrobial potential. In this study, 54 endophytes were isolated and molecularly identified from R. roxburghii. The preliminary screening using the plate confrontation method resulted in 15 different endophytic strains showing at least one strong inhibition or three or more moderate inhibition against the 12 tested strains. Further re-screening experiments based on the disc diffusion method demonstrated that Epicoccum latusicollum HGUP191049 and Setophoma terrestris HGUP190028 had excellent antagonistic activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test for extracellular metabolites finally indicated that HGUP191049 had lower MIC values and a broader antimicrobial spectrum, compared to HGUP190028. Genomic, non-target metabolomic, and comparative genomic studies were performed to understand the biosynthetic capacity of the screened-out endophytic fungus. Genome sequencing and annotation of HGUP191049 revealed a size of 33.24 megabase pairs (Mbp), with 24 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), where the putative antimicrobial compounds, oxyjavanicin, patulin and squalestatin S1 were encoded by three different BGCs, respectively. In addition, the non-targeted metabolic results demonstrated that the strain contained approximately 120 antimicrobial secondary metabolites and was structurally diverse. Finally, comparative genomics revealed differences in pathogenicity, virulence, and carbohydrate-active enzymes in the genome of Epicoccum spp. Moreover, the results of the comparative analyses presumed that Epicoccum is a promising source of antimicrobial terpenes, while oxyjavanicin and squalestatin S1 are antimicrobial compounds shared by the genus. In conclusion, R. roxburghii and the endophytic HGUP191049 isolated from it are promising sources of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. 1 Introduction 1 Introduction Endophytic fungi are generally recognized as a group of microorganisms that do not cause substantial damage to the host and live harmlessly in healthy plant tissues throughout a certain life cycle stage (Yuan et al., 2018). The existence of fungi inside the tissues of healthy plants has been known as early as the late 19th century when endophytic fungi were first successfully isolated from darnel (Lolium temulentum) (Freeman, 1904; Kusari et al., 2012). However, plant endophytic fungi had not attracted much attention as a new microbial resource until 1993. When an endophytic fungus, Ceriporiopsis andreanae (basionym Taxomyces andreanae), was isolated from Taxus brevifolia for the production of taxol, which initiated a surge in studies on endophytes (Stierle et al., 1993; Cheng et al., 2022). Another excellent anticancer drug, vincristine is originally reported from Catharanthus roseus, endophytic Fusarium oxysporum isolated from this plant can also produce vinblastine and vincristine in appreciable amounts (Kumar et al., 2013). The herb Artemisia annua L. is well known for its antimalarial properties and is the source of the antimalarial drug artemisinin (Madsen et al., 2010). Extracts of both endophytic Penicillium and Talaromyces isolated from A. annua exhibited significant antimalarial activity (Alhadrami et al., 2021). Therefore, endophytic fungi can produce the same natural products as their host plants. Importantly, microbial fermentation has several advantages over the use of plants for the production of bioactive substances, such as easy-to-operate, reducing the need for plants, and obtaining stronger active drug derivatives by varying the culture conditions (Kumar et al., 2013).

Various endophytic fungi have been employed in recent years to produce bioactive compounds, such as Aspergillus, Epicoccum, Hypoxylon, Induratia, Penicillium, Phoma, Phaeosphaeria, Saccharomycopsis, Sarocladium, Trichoderma, and Wickerhamomyces. The biologically active secondary metabolites deriving from endophytic fungi belong to diverse structural classes. The secondary metabolites include alkaloids, anthraquinones, polyketides, sterols, terpenes, and volatile organic compounds (Zhang et al., 2021a). They possess potent antimicrobial, antiviral, insecticidal, antioxidative, antidiabetic, cytotoxic, and anticancer properties (Deshmukh et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019; Fernando et al., 2020; Manganyi and Ateba, 2020; Pal et al., 2020; Rahaman et al., 2020; Agrawal et al., 2022). A few endophytic fungi can produce phytohormones to promote the growth of their host plants. And synthesize bioactive compounds to increase the resistance of the plants to environmental stresses. Still, they can also promote the accumulation of secondary metabolites initially produced by the plant, including pharmaceutical ingredients (Jia et al., 2016).

Research on endophytic fungi has become more accessible with the continual advancement of sequencing and omics technologies. Genetics- and genomics-based strategies have emerged as a comprehensive approach to studying natural microbial products (Walker et al., 2020). It is possible to elucidate the basic pathways of secondary metabolites isolated from organisms using these technologies. These technologies can facilitate the computational discovery of biosynthetic pathways. Producer strains for biosynthesis are investigated, silenced biosynthetic gene clusters are activated, and synthetic pathways for novel compounds are designed to increase their yields and activity (Sagita et al., 2021). Comparative multi-genome analysis significantly improves understanding of the genetic and metabolic diversity of endophytic fungi involved in different host-plant interactions (Ye et al., 2017). Additionally, the putative functional characteristics of endophytes can be elucidated by metagenome-based analyses (Gupta et al., 2020).

Rosa roxburghii Tratt., a homology of medicine and food, has received considerable attention across many research fields because of its notably high vitamin C. Various phytochemicals extracted from its fruits, roots, and leaves have shown potential antimicrobial activity. When choline chloride with lactic acid or levulinic acid (molar ratio 1:2) as deep eutectic solvents, the extracts of R. roxburghii leaves showed incredible antibacterial activities against the five tested pathogens (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus), with the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.012 to 0.049 mg/mL (Wang et al., 2021). Strictinin isomers, separated from the root of this plant, were excellent antimicrobial components, mainly responsible for oxidative stress and protein synthesis disorder (Ma et al., 2020). Since R. roxburghii is a botanical source of antimicrobial compounds, it may represent a promising target for screening endophytic fungi with antimicrobial potential. We isolated endophytic fungi from R. roxburghii and screened the most prospective strain by antimicrobial activity assays. Additionally, we investigated the strain’s biosynthetic capacity through genomics, non-targeted metabolomics, and comparative genomics.

Endophytic fungi were isolated from different tissue parts using a surface sterilization method (Wang et al., 2019). The main steps of the procedure: Tissue segments were surface-sterilized with 75% ethanol for 1 min, rinsed thrice with sterile water, immersed in 1% (w/v) aqueous sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 1–3 minutes (roots, 2 min; stems and seeds, 3min; and leaves, fruits, and flowers, 1 min), and washed thrice again with sterile distilled water. Six different media were used for fungal isolation, namely, potato dextrose agar (PDA), oatmeal agar (OA), malt extract agar (MEA), Czapek Dox agar (CDA), water agar (WA), and synthetic low nutrient agar (SNA). The media were supplemented with streptomycin sulphate (0.5 g/L) to avoid bacterial contamination. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of surface sterilization was examined according to the previous description (Singh et al., 2017; Rojas et al., 2020). All pure isolates were stored at -80°C with 30% glycerol.

Endophytic fungi were identified based on multigene phylogenetic analyses. Consensus sequences were edited with BioEdit v. 7.0.9.0 (Hall, 1999). Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT v. 7 (Katoh et al., 2019), manually adjusted in BioEdit, and concatenated in PhyloSuite v. 1.2.2 (Zhang et al., 2020). Phylogenetic analyses were inferred from maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). ModelFinder determined the substitution models based on the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017). BIC was used for ML analyses, while AIC was used for BI analyses. ML tree inference was constructed using 10,000 ultrafast bootstraps (Minh et al., 2013) under the edge-linked partition model implemented in IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2014). BI analyses were carried out in MrBayes 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al., 2012) under the partition models, with two independent runs of four chains that were run for five million generations using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

The width of the zone of inhibition (I) between tested fungi (or bacteria) and endophytes was determined according to the previously described method (Gao et al., 2021). The definition of the inhibition intensity is based on the previously described method (Gashgari et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2019). The intensity is divided into four levels, which are indicated by 0, 1, 2, and 3 for no inhibition, weak inhibition, moderate inhibition, and strong inhibition, respectively. For evaluating antifungal activity: 0 (I = 0 mm), 1 (0 mm < I ≤ 1 mm), 2 (1 mm < I ≤ 3 mm), and 3 (I > 3 mm); for antibacterial activity: 0 (I ≤ 1 mm), 1 (1 mm < I ≤ 2 mm), 2 (2 mm < I ≤ 10 mm), and 3 (I > 10 mm). Through phylogenetic analyses and preliminary screening, strains were selected for re-screening antimicrobial activity under the following principles: with the best inhibition effect in the same species and strong inhibition of at least one or moderate inhibition of three or more against the tested strains.

The intensity is divided into four levels, which are indicated by 0, 1, 2, and 3 for no inhibition, weak inhibition, moderate inhibition, and strong inhibition, respectively. For evaluating antifungal activity: 0 (I = 0 mm), 1 (0 mm < I ≤ 1 mm), 2 (1 mm < I ≤ 3 mm), and 3 (I > 3 mm); for antibacterial activity: 0 (I ≤ 1 mm), 1 (1 mm < I ≤ 2 mm), 2 (2 mm < I ≤ 10 mm), and 3 (I > 10 mm). Through phylogenetic analyses and preliminary screening, strains were selected for re-screening antimicrobial activity under the following principles: with the best inhibition effect in the same species and strong inhibition of at least one or moderate inhibition of three or more against the tested strains. Endophytic strains with antagonistic ability were screened out by the plate confrontation method (Gao et al., 2021).

. In this study, the antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi was superior to the antifungal activity. The antimicrobial activity may be strain-specific owing to significant differences observed among strains of the same endophytic species, such as Alternaria tenuissima, Emmia latemarginata, and Neofusicoccum sp. Most endophytes exhibited broad-spectrum activities, whereas another small group did not display any antimicrobial activity, e.g., Macrophomina phaseolina and Paraphoma vinacea. Concretely, endophytes showed stronger antibacterial activity against Ba. Subtilis, and hardly any activity were observed against Py. oryzae. Although generally described as pathogens, some species as endophytic fungi also demonstrated potential antimicrobial activity, e.g., Al. tenuissima HGUP191067. In general, 15 endophytes were selected for subsequent experiments based on molecular identification and the strength of inhibition activity (

These extracellular and intracellular metabolites, which were prepared from the preliminary screened-out strains, showed broad-spectrum antifungal activity against at least one phytopathogenic fungus. However, most metabolites exhibited less than 20% inhibition against the six tested fungi. Fortunately, endophytic strains Epicoccum latusicollum HGUP191049, Neofusicoccum sp. HGUP191080, and Setophoma terrestris HGUP190028 displayed potential as antifungal agents since their metabolites displayed over 30% inhibition rate against at least one of the tested fungi. Of these, the extracellular metabolites of HGUP191049 and HGUP190028 were highly effective against L. theobromae with inhibition rates was 58.5 ± 3.4% and 51.4 ± 3.4%, respectively.

Notes: The screened strain HGUP191049 and the type of Ep. latusicollum are phylogenetically similar as they cluster together with well support (
Supplementary Figure 1
). Our collection resembles the type CGMCC 3.18346 in having a pycnidial wall, conidiogenous cells, and conidia. However, our collection slightly differs from the type in having aggregated conidiomata rather than solitary conidiomata (Chen et al., 2017). Therefore, the examined morphology overlaps and is phylogenetically identical to Ep. latusicollum. We report our collection as a new host record of Ep. latusicollum from the stem of R. roxburghii.

Screening of PHI annotated phenotypes showed that most genes belonged to “reduced virulence”, “unaffected pathogenicity”, and “loss of pathogenicity”. In contrast, few genes were associated with the “effector (plant avirulence determinant)” (one gene), “enhanced antagonism” (one gene), and “chemistry target sensitivity to chemical” (none) phenotypes (

, strains with different nutrient modes of the same Epicoccum species may possess the same gene numbers of “increased pathogenicity (hypervirulence)” type, such as Ep. latusicollum (HGUP191049 and T41), Ep. nigrum (cf0051 and ICMP 19927), and Ep. sorghinum (BS2-1 and USPMTOX48), having 8, 7, 8 genes of this type for them, respectively. Of this phenotypic gene, the seven genomes in this study shared seven identical genes of this type, whereas Ep. latusicollum (HGUP191049 and T41) and Ep. sorghinum (BS2-1 and USPMTOX48) had one more of this type gene than the other genomes, namely PHI:5494, which may be a vital contributor to the difference in pathogenicity between species. In addition, an endophyte of the same species may contain more “loss of pathogenicity phenotypic genes” than a pathogen, e.g. endophytic strain HGUP191049 has two more genes of this type than pathogenic strain T41, and endophytic cf0051 has four more genes than pathogenic ICMP 19927. Moreover, for Ep. latusicollum, endophytic HGUP191049 had six “loss of pathogenicity” phenotypic genes (PHI: 2145, PHI: 4095, PHI: 10527, PHI: 9899, and PHI: 8875) different from the pathogenic T41 (PHI: 8734, PHI: 5232, and PHI: 9357), which may be one of the factors contributing to their differences in pathogenicity within species.

CAZymes are responsible for degrading host plant cells and establishing colonization for plant pathogenic and endophytic fungi. As biocontrol fungi, CAZymes can be used to destroy the cell walls of pathogens and nematodes (Yang et al., 2019). The CAZymes involved in the degradation of plant cell walls were further classified into the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, and those involved in the degradation of fungal cell walls were grouped into the degradation of chitin and β-1,3-glucan (Zhao et al., 2013; Kubicek et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2019).

Figure 9
, the main CAZyme gene families that differ significantly between Epicoccum and Didymella are GH10, GH28, GH43, and PL1. In this study, 41.5% (17/41) of the families are identical among and within species in Epicoccum, such as GH6, all of which are 3 in number. Other families differ in the number of characteristics by 1–2, with a few 3, as in GH43. However, it is significantly different for GH18, which belongs to a family associated with chitin degradation, with numbers ranging from 9 to 15, which may be an important factor influencing the difference in the antifungal potential of Epicoccum spp. Of Ep. latusicollum, the biological activity of strain HGUP191049 distinguished from T41 in having different amounts of GH3 and GH45, GH43, GH78 and PL3, and GH18, for the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and chitin, respectively.

Phylogenetic relationships of BGCs from six Epicoccum strains and evolutionarily adjacent species D. exigua were analyzed to investigate differences among secondary metabolites of Epicoccum spp. (

The same types of BGCs with high identity may encode the same secondary metabolites, while the corresponding BGCs of a compound may be in different evolutionary branches. Notably, Epicoccum species have BGCs encoding the same compounds. The same branch of Ep. latusicollum (Contig0006.1 and JACCMO010000004.1) and Ep. sorghinum (VXJJ01000017.1 and MIEO01000350.1) (Clade 18), which all encode oxyjavanicin, where Ep. nigrum, the BGC JAASLF010000044.1, which encodes this compound, belongs to Clade 8. Similarly, squalestatin S1 is also encoded by BGCs from six different Epicoccum genomes.

Approximately 8,000 medicinal plants have been developed into drugs and biocides, contributing more than 7,000 compounds to the pharmaceutical industry (Kaul et al., 2012). However, the overuse of medicinal plants in traditional folk medicine practices has led to environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. Developing bioactive compounds based on endophytic fungi can reduce deforestation and the extinction of important and valuable medicinal plants (Uzma et al., 2019). Medicinal plants are a valuable source for exploring biologically active endophytes (Kaul et al., 2012). In this study, R. roxburghii is an economically important source of medicine and food. Its fruit is rich in vitamin C (up to 2 000 mg/100 g), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and flavonoids (Xu et al., 2019; Hou et al., 2020). The root, leaf, and fruit of R. roxburghii have been used as traditional medicinal materials to treat several diseases, such as dyspepsia, enteritis, and scurvy. In addition, some components extracted from R. roxburghii have been demonstrated to possess biological activities, including hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, immune-enhancing, and antitumor effects (Zhang et al., 2021b). More importantly, R. roxburghii is also a plant source of antimicrobial compounds (Ma et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). Therefore, we selected R. roxburghii as a candidate for screening endophytic fungi with antimicrobial activity. Medicinal plants have long been used as a source of medicine.

Species-level identification of fungi is a critical step to ensure reproducibility and is essential for both basic scientific research (ecology, taxonomy) and applied scientific research (genomics, bioprospecting). However, only 14% of fungal secondary metabolites studies have combined morphological and molecular data for identification (Raja et al., 2017). The results of these investigations suggest that the identification of fungi in most such studies is unreliable, as a single gene (mainly ITS) may fail to distinguish closely related members of certain genera phylogenetically. More than a quarter of GenBank fungal ITS sequences have not been adequately confirmed taxonomically (Zhang et al., 2021b). For accurate species identification, molecular data (preferably polygenic) should be combined with morphological studies (Woudenberg et al., 2017). In this study, we obtained the antimicrobial active strain Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049, whose taxonomic status was confirmed by morphology and multigene phylogenetic analyses.

In this study, we obtained the antimicrobial active strain Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049, whose taxonomic status was confirmed by morphology and multigene phylogenetic analyses. In this study, the strains isolated from R. roxburghii with antimicrobial activity were screened out by multigene phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2, TUB, TEF, and ACT), the plate confrontation method, and the disc diffusion method, namely Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049, Neofusicoccum sp. HGUP191080, and Se. terrestris HGUP190028. Epicoccum latusicollum has been reported to be capable of causing several plant diseases, including leaf spots on tobacco and Elaeagnus pungens (Guo et al., 2021; Qi et al., 2021), stalk rot on maize (Zea mays L.) (Xu et al., 2022), and root rot on Nicotiana tabacum (Gai et al., 2020). In this work, this species is first reported as an endophytic fungus with antimicrobial activity and is a new host record from R. roxburghii. Another strain with antimicrobial activity, Neofusicoccum sp. HGUP191080 may phylogenetically represent a new species and requires further identification by morphology. Neofusicoccum species, which are endophytes or pathogens of plants, produce structurally different metabolites that show interesting biological activities such as antibacterial, cytotoxic, and phytotoxic (Salvatore et al., 2021). Finally, Se. terrestris caused pink root rot in various plants, such as squash, canola, and winter squash (Ikeda et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2017; Rivedal et al., 2018). However, as an endophyte isolated from Dysoxylum binectariferum, Se. terrestris is known to produce blennolides with anticancer and antimicrobial activity (Arora et al., 2018). Thus, some species commonly reported as pathogens may have potential biological activity as endophytic fungi. Further MIC assays demonstrated that the present study’s antimicrobial strength and spectrum of Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049 were superior to other strains.

The development of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, high-throughput technologies, and computational resources has significantly broadened the understanding of the key pathways affecting the synthesis of fungal secondary metabolites (Palazzotto and Weber, 2018). In this study, genomics, non-target metabolomics, and comparative genomics were performed further to investigate the biosynthetic capacity of Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049. Genes required for secondary metabolite synthesis are typically arranged in a multigene biosynthetic gene cluster (Yang et al., 2019). With this high-quality genome sequence and annotation, we predicted a total of 24 BGCs, which may encode eight known compounds. Of these compounds, squalestatin S1, oxyjavanicin, and patulin were reported to have antimicrobial activity (Nicolaou et al., 1994; Paytubi et al., 2017; Kato et al., 2020). Genetic modification of BGCs and/or introduction of a particular mutation provides opportunities to obtain derivatives of the original metabolites (Ichikawa et al., 2012). Genome mining of gene clusters encoding biosynthetic pathways of fungal secondary metabolites has become a critical approach for new compound discovery (Weber et al., 2015). The sequencing and annotation of the Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049 genome is the foundation for the identification of antimicrobial compound BGCs, the activation of silencing gene clusters, and the identification and regulation of biosynthetic pathways. In this study, non-targeted metabolic analyses further revealed the biosynthetic capacity and potential antimicrobial compounds of Ep. latusicollum HGUP191049 by determining all detectable metabolites. Moreover, patulin, a compound encoded by gene cluster 16, has also been detected.

Comparative genomics aims to use an ensemble of related genomes to improve the understanding of each genome in the set (Haubold & Wiehe, 2004). Epicoccum is a genus in which endophytic, saprophytic, and pathogenic modes of nutrition coexist, such as Ep. nigrum is a primary saprophyte involved in the retting of flax (Brown, 1984), an endophytic fungus isolated from the leaves of Lysidice rhodostegia (Wang et al., 2010), even a pathogen that causes leaf spot disease on Lablab purpureus (Mahadevakumar et al., 2014). So, Epicoccum species may reshape their lifestyles among endophytic, saprophytic, and pathogenic to adapt to changing environmental conditions (Kuo et al., 2014). The fungus may secrete numerous proteins that facilitate colonization during interaction with the plant (Yin et al., 2015). Nine high-level phenotypic terms are defined in PHI-base to compare the pathogen-host interactions between organisms across the tree of life (Urban et al., 2017). Using comparative genomic approaches, we show that PHI:5494, one of the “increased pathogenicity (hypervirulence)” type genes, may be an important factor in the difference in pathogenicity between Epicoccum species. Moreover, endophytic HGUP191049 had six “loss of pathogenicity” phenotypic genes different from the pathogenic T41, which may account for the lifestyle differences in Ep. latusicollum.

Currently, CAZyme gene families are defined and classified into six main categories in the CAZy database: glycosyltransferases (GTs), glycoside hydrolases (GHs), polysaccharide lyases (PLs), carbohydrate esterases (CEs), carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), and enzymes of auxiliary activities (AAs) (Zhang et al., 2018). Of these families, GH18 is related to a family of chitin degradation in amounts ranging from 9 to 15 by comparative analyses, which may be an important factor contributing to the differences in the antifungal potential of Epicoccum spp. Currently, CAZyme gene families are defined and classified into six main categories in the CAZy database: glycosyltransferases (GTs), glycoside hydrolases (GHs), polysaccharide lyases (PLs), carbohydrate esterases (CEs), carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), and enzymes of auxiliary activities (AAs) (Zhang et al., 2018).

Genes encoding biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites are usually located on chromosomes forming BGCs (Yao et al., 2021). Results from comparative analyses show that Epicoccum is a promising source of terpenes. Terpenes exhibit antimicrobial activity owing to their highly lipophilic nature, which may interfere with the integrity and function of cell membranes (Sohrabi et al., 2015). In addition, oxyjavanicin and squalestatin S1 reported as antimicrobial agents (Nicolaou et al., 1994; Kato et al., 2020), are putative secondary metabolites shared by Epicoccum spp. In this study, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial potential strain was screened out from the endophytic fungi of R. roxburghii and analyzed for biosynthetic capacity.
