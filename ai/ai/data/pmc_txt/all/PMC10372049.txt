Tylosin is a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic widely used in veterinary medicine to control infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens and mycoplasmas. To improve the fermentation titer of tylosin in the hyperproducing Streptomyces xinghaiensis strain TL01, we sequenced its whole genome and identified the biosynthetic gene cluster therein. Overexpression of the tylosin efflux gene tlrC, the cluster-situated S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) synthetase gene metKcs, the SAM biosynthetic genes adoKcs-metFcs, or the pathway-specific activator gene tylR enhanced tylosin production by 18%, 12%, 11%, and 11% in the respective engineered strains TLPH08-2, TLPH09, TLPH10, and TLPH12. Co-overexpression of metKcs and adoKcs-metFcs as two transcripts increased tylosin production by 22% in the resultant strain TLPH11 compared to that in TL01. Furthermore, combinational overexpression of tlrC, metKcs, adoKcs-metFcs, and tylR as four transcripts increased tylosin production by 23% (10.93g/L) in the resultant strain TLPH17 compared to that in TL01. However, a negligible additive effect was displayed upon combinational overexpression in TLPH17 as suggested by the limited increment of fermentation titer compared to that in TLPH08-2. Transcription analyses indicated that the expression of tlrC and three SAM biosynthetic genes in TLPH17 was considerably lower than that of TLPH08-2 and TLPH11. Based on this observation, the five genes were rearranged into one or two operons to coordinate their overexpression, yielding two engineered strains TLPH23 and TLPH24, and leading to further enhancement of tylosin production over TLPH17. In particular, the production of TLPH23 reached 11.35 g/L. These findings indicated that the combinatorial strategy is a promising approach for enhancing tylosin production in high-yielding industrial strains. Keywords Introduction Introduction Macrolides are antibiotics of choice for treating many common bacterial diseases in humans and animals, such as gastroenteritis and respiratory infections. Tylosin is a 16-membered macrolide widely used in veterinary medicine to control infections caused by Gram-positive organisms, mycoplasmas, and Campylobacter, owing to its broad-spectrum, safety, and oral efficacy [1]. Tylosin is also the critical substrate for the synthesis of third-generation macrolides such as tylvalosin, tilmicosin, and tildipirosin [2,3]. Macrolides are antibiotics of choice for treating many common bacterial diseases in humans and animals, such as gastroenteritis and respiratory infections. Tylosin is a 16-membered macrolide widely used in veterinary medicine to control infections caused by Gram-positive organisms, mycoplasmas, and Campylobacter, owing to its broad-spectrum, safety, and oral efficacy [1]. Tylosin is also the critical substrate for the synthesis of third-generation macrolides such as tylvalosin, tilmicosin, and tildipirosin [2,3]. Tylosin was isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces fradiae [4], S. hygroscopicus [5], and S. rimosus [6], among which S. fradiae (also named S. xinghaiensis) is used in industrial production [7,8]. Structurally, tylosin is composed of a 16-membered macrolactone ring and three deoxyhexose sugars (mycaminose, mycarose, and mycinose). The tylosin biosynthetic gene cluster of S. fradiae has been elucidated, which contains at least 43 open reading frames (ORFs) involved in assembly and modification of the macrolactone skeleton, biosynthesis and attachment of the deoxyhexose sugar moieties, self-resistance, transportation, regulation, and unknown function [[9], [10], [11]]. The production of tylosin in S. fradiae is regulated by five cluster-situated regulatory genes encoding two repressors (TylP and TylQ) and three activators (TylS, TylU, and TylR) via a complex cascade. TylP is a deduced gamma-butyrolactone receptor that downregulates tylP, tylQ, and tylS by targeting their promoters. TylR is a pathway-specific activator that directly activates transcription of tylosin biosynthetic genes, and the expression of tylR is controlled by the activators (TylS and TylU) and the repressor TylQ [[11], [12], [13]].

Industrial production of antibiotics requires strain improvement to reduce manufacturing costs. Random mutagenesis [14,15], medium optimization [16,17], and genome shuffling [18] were practically utilized for strain improvement for tylosin production; however, these approaches relied on empirical screening and are time-consuming. Rational metabolic engineering strategies are effective in enhancing the yield of macrolide antibiotics, such as enhancing the supply of biosynthetic precursors or cofactors [19], overexpressing efflux or resistance genes [20], and manipulating the regulation of biosynthetic pathways [21]. Inactivation of the repressor genes, tylP or tylQ, has been found to be responsible for elevated tylosin production in mutants obtained via random mutagenesis breeding [[22], [23], [24]]. Overexpression of cluster-situated activator genes tylR and tylS has been demonstrated to increase production of tylosin [12,25]. Additionally, the yield of many macrolides, such as pikromycin [26], salinomycin [27], ascomycin [28], pristinamycin [29], and avermectin [30], was effectively enhanced by the combination of multiple metabolic engineering strategies. In a recent study, a genomics-based combinatorial engineering strategy was established in Actinoplanes deccanensis, resulting in improvement in fidaxomicin production (27-fold, 619.2 mg/L) and the genetic stability of the producing strain [31].

In the present study, we aimed to enhance the extracellular production of tylosin in an industrial producer, S. xinghaiensis TL01, using a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy. We sequenced the whole genome of TL01 and identified the tylosin biosynthetic gene cluster. Single overexpression of the tylosin efflux gene, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) biosynthetic genes, or the pathway-specific activator gene tylR resulted in significant enhancement of extracellular tylosin production. These genes were combined for co-overexpression, which led to a slight additional improvement in tylosin production. To solve this problem, we performed transcriptome analysis on the engineered strains and developed a fine-tuned combinatorial approach that led to further elevation of tylosin production. These observations provided valuable guidance for enhancing the production of other critical secondary metabolites in the high-yielding strains.

The S. xinghaiensis TL01 tyl BGC contains 43 ORFs (Fig. 1B), including genes for the assembly and modification of the 16-membered lactone aglycone, synthesis and incorporation of three sugar moieties, transcriptional regulation, resistance, and tylosin efflux (Table S4). Overexpression of the efflux gene tlrC increased tylosin production Overexpression of the efflux gene tlrC increased tylosin production Overexpression of the efflux gene tlrC increased tylosin production In HPLC analysis of the fermentation broth of TL01, a large amount of tylosin (about 1.58 g per liter of broth, equal to 18% of the extracellular tylosin production) was observed to be associated with the mycelial pellet, which was inaccessible to the current industrial production process. To increase the extracellular production of tylosin, we constructed two mutants, TLPH08-1 and TLPH08-2, by integrating an additional copy of the tylosin efflux gene tlrC under the control of the native promoter PtlrC or the strong constitutive promoter kasOp* in the S. xinghaiensis TL01 chromosome.

As shown in Fig. 2B, the extracellular tylosin production of TLPH08-1 (9.53 g/L) and TLPH08-2 (10.51 g/L) was increased by 7% and 18%, respectively, compared to that of the original strain TL01. In particular, the ratio of intracellular to extracellular tylosin decreased significantly in TLPH08-1 (15%) and TLPH08-2 (10%) compared to that in TL01 (18%) (Fig. S1). Integration of the empty vector did not affect the production of tylosin in the resultant strain, TLSET152. To investigate the influence of tlrC overexpression on tylosin fermentation, we determined the extracellular tylosin production and biomass of TLPH08-2, TL01, and TLSET152 at an interval of 24 h until 168 h. We observed that TLPH08-2 produced more extracellular tylosin throughout the fermentation process (Fig. 2C). The biomass of TLPH08-2 was slightly better than that of TL01 and TLSET152, although the difference was not statistically significant. These results suggested that overexpression of tlrC enhanced the production of extracellular tylosin by increasing tylosin export and thereby reducing the putative feedback inhibition.Fig. 2Effects of single overexpression of the tylosin efflux gene tlrC, SAM biosynthetic genes, and pathway-specific activator gene tylR on tylosin production and cell growth.

Enhancing tylosin production by improving SAM biosynthesis or overexpressing the pathway specific activator gene tylR Enhancing tylosin production by improving SAM biosynthesis or overexpressing the pathway specific activator gene tylR Enhancing tylosin production by improving SAM biosynthesis or overexpressing the pathway specific activator gene tylR The tylosin biosynthetic pathway involves multiple methyl transfer steps catalyzed by SAM-dependent methyltransferases, in which SAM acts as the co-substrate and methyl donor [10]. Coincidentally, the TL01 tylosin BGC contains a putative operon encoding paralogs of SAM synthetase (metKcs), adenosine kinase (adoKcs), and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (metFcs) belonging to the methionine cycle and folate cycle that are primarily involved in the biosynthesis of SAM (Fig. 2A). The subscript cs indicates they are cluster-situated paralogs. To improve the SAM supply in S. xinghaiensis TL01, additional copies of these genes in the form of kasOp*-metKcs or kasOp*-adoKcs-metFcs were integrated into the chromosome of TL01 using pSET152 as the vector, yielding the mutants TLPH09 and TLPH10, respectively. Further, kasOp*-metKcs and kasOp*-adoKcs-metFcs were integrated together in TL01 to yield a combined overexpression mutant TLPH11.

Further, kasOp*-metKcs and kasOp*-adoKcs-metFcs were integrated together in TL01 to yield a combined overexpression mutant TLPH11. HPLC analysis revealed that the extracellular tylosin production of TLPH09, TLPH10, and TLPH11 increased by 12%, 11%, and 22%, respectively (Fig. 2B). Among these mutants, the combined engineered strain TLPH11 overexpressing both metKsc and the adoKsc-metFsc operon yielded the highest level of tylosin (10.87 g/L). To determine the SAM supply in TLPH11, we quantified the intracellular SAM content using LC-MS/MS. As expected, the intracellular SAM concentration of TLPH11 was 78.43 μmol/kg cell dry weight, which was significantly enhanced by 1.86-fold compared to that of TL01 (27.42 μmol/kg cell dry weight) (Fig. S2). The production curves confirmed the increase in tylosin titer in TLPH11. In particular, the tylosin production titer of TLPH11 was consistently higher than that of the starting strain TL01 and the vector control TLSET152 at all time points (24−168 h) (Fig. 2C). The biomass of TLPH11 did not differ from that of TL01 or the vector control, suggesting that the growth of TLPH11 was not significantly affected (Fig. 2D).

In addition, TylR is a pathway-specific activator that directly activates transcription of tylosin biosynthetic genes and is positively related to tylosin production [25]. Accordingly, we integrated a copy of kasOp*-tylR into the TL01 chromosome. The resultant mutant TLPH12 produced 11% more tylosin than TL01. The biomass of TLPH12 was not affected compared to that of TL01 or the vector control (Fig. 2D).

Combinational overexpression of multiple genes elevated the production of tylosin Combinational overexpression of multiple genes elevated the production of tylosin Combinational overexpression of multiple genes elevated the production of tylosin To further improve tylosin production, the engineered gene cassettes kasOp*-tlrC, kasOp*-metKcs, kasOp*-adoKcs-metFcs, and kasOp*-tylR were combined and integrated into TL01, generating the mutant strain TLPH17. We also integrated an additional copy of tlrC, metKcs, adoKcs-metFcs, and tylR under their native promoters in TL01 to generate TLPH01. Compared to that of TL01, extracellular tylosin production was increased by 14% in TLPH01 (10.11 g/L) and by 23% in TLPH17 (10.93 g/L) (Fig. 3A), suggesting an advantage of the strong promoter kasOp* over the native promoters for overexpression. However, TLPH17 only achieved a small increment (4.5%, P < 0.05) in tylosin production over the efflux-overexpressing strain TLPH08-2 and differed negligibly (0.41%, P > 0.05) from the SAM biosynthetic gene-overexpressing strain TLPH11. This indicated that the combinational overexpression of the five genes in TLPH17 resulted in a poor additive effect on the elevation of extracellular tylosin production compared to the single overexpression of the efflux or the SAM biosynthetic pathway. Consistently, the ratio of intracellular to extracellular tylosin in TLPH17 (13%) was determined to be significantly higher than that in the efflux-overexpressing strain TLPH08-2 (10%) (Fig. S1). The intracellular SAM content in TLPH17 (56.31 μmol/kg cell dry weight) was lesser than that of the SAM-overproducing strain TLPH11 (78.43 μmol/kg cell dry weight), although it was higher than those of TL01 and TLPH01 (Fig. S2). These results largely attributed the poor additive effect of TLPH17 to its lower tylosin efflux compared to that of TLPH08-2 and lesser SAM supply compared to that of TLPH11.Fig. 3Effects of combinational overexpression of the tylosin efflux gene tlrC, cluster-situated SAM biosynthetic genes, and pathway-specific activator gene tylR on tylosin production and cell growth.

We also integrated an additional copy of tlrC, metKcs, adoKcs-metFcs, and tylR under their native promoters in TL01 to generate TLPH01. Compared to that of TL01, extracellular tylosin production was increased by 14% in TLPH01 (10.11 g/L) and by 23% in TLPH17 (10.93 g/L) (Fig. 3A), suggesting an advantage of the strong promoter kasOp* over the native promoters for overexpression. However, TLPH17 only achieved a small increment (4.5%, P < 0.05) in tylosin production over the efflux-overexpressing strain TLPH08-2 and differed negligibly (0.41%, P > 0.05) from the SAM biosynthetic gene-overexpressing strain TLPH11. This indicated that the combinational overexpression of the five genes in TLPH17 resulted in a poor additive effect on the elevation of extracellular tylosin production compared to the single overexpression of the efflux or the SAM biosynthetic pathway. Consistently, the ratio of intracellular to extracellular tylosin in TLPH17 (13%) was determined to be significantly higher than that in the efflux-overexpressing strain TLPH08-2 (10%) (Fig. S1). The intracellular SAM content in TLPH17 (56.31 μmol/kg cell dry weight) was lesser than that of the SAM-overproducing strain TLPH11 (78.43 μmol/kg cell dry weight), although it was higher than those of TL01 and TLPH01 (Fig. S2). These results largely attributed the poor additive effect of TLPH17 to its lower tylosin efflux compared to that of TLPH08-2 and lesser SAM supply compared to that of TLPH11.Fig. 3Effects of combinational overexpression of the tylosin efflux gene tlrC, cluster-situated SAM biosynthetic genes, and pathway-specific activator gene tylR on tylosin production and cell growth.

Transcriptional analysis of three high tylosin-producing strains Transcriptional analysis of three high tylosin-producing strains Transcriptional analysis of three high tylosin-producing strains To understand the differences in gene expression associated with the improvement in tylosin production and the reason underlying the poor additive effect from combinational overexpression in TLPH17, the transcriptomes of three high tylosin-producing engineered strains (TLPH08-2, TLPH11, and TLPH17) and the vector control strain TLSET152 at 96 h of fermentation were analyzed using RNA-Seq. To understand the differences in gene expression associated with the improvement in tylosin production and the reason underlying the poor additive effect from combinational overexpression in TLPH17, the transcriptomes of three high tylosin-producing engineered strains (TLPH08-2, TLPH11, and TLPH17) and the vector control strain TLSET152 at 96 h of fermentation were analyzed using RNA-Seq. To understand the differences in gene expression associated with the improvement in tylosin production and the reason underlying the poor additive effect from combinational overexpression in TLPH17, the transcriptomes of three high tylosin-producing engineered strains (TLPH08-2, TLPH11, and TLPH17) and the vector control strain TLSET152 at 96 h of fermentation were analyzed using RNA-Seq. First, the tylosin BGC in all strains was highly expressed, corroborating hyperproduction of tylosin. For example, in the vector control strain TLSET152, 27 of 154 highly expressed chromosomal genes (FPKM>1000) in the transcriptome were located in tylosin BGC, while only three tylosin BGC genes (tlrB, tylQ, and tylC Ⅶ) were poorly expressed (FPKM<100). Interestingly, we observed that the expression level of 27 of 43 genes in the tylosin BGC was significantly higher in TLPH08-2, TLPH11, and TLPH17 (P<0.05, fold change = 1.4–12.9), including the engineered target genes tlrC in TLPH08-2, metKcs and adoKcs-metFcs in TLPH11 and TLPH17 (P<0.05, fold change>2.0), and all tylosin biosynthetic genes except for the tylGI-ccr operon genes (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, the RNA-Seq data indicated lack of any obvious difference between the tlrC expression (FPKM values) of TLPH17 and the vector control TLSET152. However, the RT-qPCR analysis showed that the expression level of tlrC in TLPH17 was significantly higher than that in TLSET152 (Fig. 5), which was consistent with the data on the intracellular to extracellular tylosin ratio presented in Fig. S1. In addition, we also found that the expression levels of the five engineered genes in TLPH17 were lower than those of tlrC in TLPH08-2, metKcs, adoKcs, and metFcs in TLPH11, and tylR in TLPH12, respectively (Fig. 4, Fig. 5).Fig. 4Gene expression values (FPKM) of genes of the tylosin BGC in TLPH08-2, TLPH11, TLPH17, and TLSET152 (vector control).

Second, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the engineered strains and the vector control TLSET152 were analyzed. In total, 668 genes (406 upregulated and 262 downregulated genes), 545 genes (339 upregulated and 206 downregulated genes), and 940 genes (585 upregulated and 355 downregulated genes) were identified as DEGs in TLPH08-2, TLPH11, and TLPH17, respectively. The DEGs shared by the three mutant strains consisted of 158 co-upregulated genes and 105 co-downregulated genes (Fig. 6A and B). Among these, 16 transporter-associated genes located outside the tylosin BGC were co-upregulated, two of which (sxh3073 and sxh3442) encoded multidrug ATP-binding cassette ABC transporters. Multidrug efflux pumps from various families can improve multiple antibiotic resistance or drug transport abilities in bacteria [36]. In TLPH08-2, TLPH11, and TLPH17, the relative expression levels of sxh3073 and sxh3442 were all significantly increased compared to those in the control (P<0.05) (Fig. 6C), suggesting that these genes may promote the efflux of tylosin, thereby reducing the possible negative effect of tylosin on cell metabolism. In addition, 28 genes located in four antiSMASH-predicted secondary metabolic BGCs were co-downregulated in these mutants (Table S5), which might save intracellular resources for tylosin synthesis.Fig. 6Analysis of differentially expressed genes in TLPH08-2, TLPH11, and TLPH17 compared to the vector control TLSET152.

Third, Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment were used to analyze the DEGs and their main biological functions. The GO terms of DEGs were mainly enriched in the catalytic activity in the molecular function category, the cell and cell part in the cellular component category, and the metabolic process and the cellular process in the biological process category in three engineered strains (Fig. 7A, C, and E). The DEGs were mainly involved in various types of secondary metabolites biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism, ABC transporters, one carbon pool by folate, and other pathways in three engineered strains (Fig. 7B, D, and F). These suggested that cell growth, energy metabolism, and other primary metabolic processes were accelerated, thereby increasing energy and precursor supplies for tylosin synthesis.Fig. 7GO enrichment and KEGG enrichment of differentially expressed genes in TLPH08-2, TLPH11, and TLPH17 compared to the vector control TLSET152.

Fine-tuning the co-overexpression of multiple genes further enhanced tylosin production Fine-tuning the co-overexpression of multiple genes further enhanced tylosin production Fine-tuning the co-overexpression of multiple genes further enhanced tylosin production In TLPH17, the co-overexpressed target genes were divided into four transcription units, each of which was under the control of the strong constitutive promoter kasOp*, followed by a terminator. As revealed by the RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data, TLPH17 showed limited tlrC expression compared to TLPH08-2 and lower expression of adoKcs and metFcs than TLPH11, which might account for the poor additive effect of combinational co-overexpression on tylosin production. We proposed that optimization of the transcriptional organization of these target genes would further improve the efflux of tylosin and SAM supply, thereby boosting extracellular tylosin production. Therefore, we constructed two mutant strains, TLPH23 and TLPH24, in which the target genes were combined into one or two transcription units for their overexpression.

Therefore, we constructed two mutant strains, TLPH23 and TLPH24, in which the target genes were combined into one or two transcription units for their overexpression. As presented in Fig. 3, the extracellular tylosin production of TLPH23 and TLPH24 reached up to 11.35 and 11.24 g/L, which were further improved by 5.1% and 3.9% compared to that of TLPH17. In particular, the TLPH23 produced the highest amount of tylosin among all the 10 mutant strains constructed in this study. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the transcription levels of tlrC, adoKcs, and metFcs were improved in TLPH23, and that the transcription levels of tlrC and adoKcs were improved in TLPH24 compared to those in TLPH17 (Fig. 5). In particular, the relative expression level of tlrC in TLPH23 and TLPH24 was increased by 1.5-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively. Consistently, their ratio of intracellular to extracellular tylosin decreased to 12%, compared to 14% for TLPH17 (Fig. S1). Nonetheless, the intracellular SAM concentration in TLPH23 and TLPH24 did not change significantly compared to that of TLPH17 (Fig. S2). Overall, these results indicated that the transcription levels of multiple co-overexpressed genes can be fine-tuned by optimizing the transcription units, which in turn boosts the extracellular production of tylosin.

In this study, after analyzing the intact biosynthetic gene cluster from the tylosin hyperproducer S. xinghaiensis TL01, we successfully increased the fermentation titer of this industrial strain by 28% via combinatorial overexpression of the cluster-situated genes for SAM supply, final product efflux, and positive regulation. Improving the fermentation titer of structurally complex secondary metabolites such as tylosin is urgently required, especially in high-producing industrial strains. In this study, after analyzing the intact biosynthetic gene cluster from the tylosin hyperproducer S. xinghaiensis TL01, we successfully increased the fermentation titer of this industrial strain by 28% via combinatorial overexpression of the cluster-situated genes for SAM supply, final product efflux, and positive regulation. Enhancement of SAM supply by exogenous addition of SAM, SAM biosynthesis precursor l-methionine, or overexpression of SAM synthetase (MetK) has been shown to increase the production of various secondary metabolites, such as streptomycin [37], ansamitocin P-3 [38], erythromycin [39], nosiheptide [40], avermectin [41], lincomycin [42], and cephalosporin C [43]. Remarkably, combinatorial engineering of SAM synthetase genes, SAM degradation genes, l-methionine synthetase, and transporter genes elevated bacitracin production in an industrial strain that already produced high levels of bacitracin [44]. However, in another study, co-overexpression of five putative SAM biosynthetic genes (metK, adoK, metH, metF, and sahH) did not significantly boost the production of novobiocin; instead, these resulted in the accumulation of high concentrations of SAM and negatively affected the viability of the engineered strain in the stationary phase [45]. The tylosin biosynthetic pathway involves four SAM-dependent methyltransferases, namely TylCⅢ, TylMⅠ, TylE, and TylF [10]. The industrial strain S. xinghaiensis TL01 harbors three SAM cycle paralog-coding genes, metKcs, adoKcs, and metFcs, organized as a putative operon in the tylosin BGC, in addition to a full set of five SAM biosynthetic orthologs scattered around the chromosome, namely, metK (sxh5659), metH (sxh5462), metF (sxh5033), adoK (sxh4973), and sahH (sxh4023). In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of metKcs alone or adoKcs-metFcs alone elevated intracellular SAM concentrations and extracellular tylosin production. Co-overexpression of metKcs and adoKcs-metFcs led to a promising elevation of 22% (in TLPH11) compared to the yield of the starting industrial strain (8.90 g/L). Furthermore, the overexpression of the cluster-situated SAM biosynthetic genes did not exert any obvious detrimental effect on the growth of the resultant strains TLPH11, TLPH17, TLPH23, and TLPH24 (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). We assumed that the remarkable increase in SAM production in these engineered strains is rapidly utilized by the tylosin biosynthetic pathway, resulting in higher production of tylosin, because of which SAM cannot accumulate to a harmful level and does not cause any obvious detrimental effect on cell growth. In fact, the SAM concentration in our engineered strains was considerably lower than the reported detrimental level in Streptomyces [45]. Therefore, we speculated that further increasing the expression of these SAM biosynthetic genes would probably further promote the production of tylosin. Nevertheless, data from this study and a previous study [44] encourage combinational overexpression of SAM biosynthetic genes to support substantial SAM production and utilization in high-producing industrial strains.

Nevertheless, data from this study and a previous study [44] encourage combinational overexpression of SAM biosynthetic genes to support substantial SAM production and utilization in high-producing industrial strains. SAM plays an important role in many intracellular biochemical processes in addition to acting as a methyl donor for methylation. Several previous studies suggested the involvement of SAM in the transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis to increase the expression level of the biosynthetic genes [37,44,46]. In our study, the transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression level of 27 of 43 tylosin biosynthetic genes was also elevated by the overexpression of SAM biosynthetic genes in TLPH11 and TLPH17 (Fig. 4), although the specific mechanism is yet to be investigated.

Efflux plays a key role in the secretion of the end product and the avoidance of self-toxicity. Overexpression of gene cluster-situated transporter genes was demonstrated to be an effective strategy to enhance the production of avermectin in a high-yield strain [20,47]. In this study, we also demonstrated that overexpression of the BGC-situated transporter gene tlrC improved extracellular production and reduced the ratio of intracellular tylosin significantly. In a recent study, Wang et al. identified six ansamitocin P-3 (AP-3) efflux genes outside the biosynthetic BGC using comparative transcriptomic analysis. Overexpression of four of these genes led to the enhancement of AP-3 production [48]. Our transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression level of two multidrug ABC transporter genes (sxh3073 and sxh3442) outside the tylosin BGC was significantly increased in three tylosin-overproducing engineered strains (TLPH08-2, TLPH11, and TLPH17). Further experiments are required to determine whether sxh3073 and sxh3442 are involved in tylosin exportation. Finally, we observed that the S. xinghaiensis TL01 strain was tolerant to high concentrations of tylosin (25 g/L, data not shown). Therefore, the improvement of fermentation titer due to tlrC overexpression may be because of the alleviation of the possible negative feedback regulation of tylosin on the biosynthetic pathway rather than because of the avoidance of self-toxicity. Efflux plays a key role in the secretion of the end product and the avoidance of self-toxicity. Overexpression of gene cluster-situated transporter genes was demonstrated to be an effective strategy to enhance the production of avermectin in a high-yield strain [20,47].

Therefore, the improvement of fermentation titer due to tlrC overexpression may be because of the alleviation of the possible negative feedback regulation of tylosin on the biosynthetic pathway rather than because of the avoidance of self-toxicity. Manipulation of regulatory genes, such as overexpression of positive regulator genes or removal of repressor genes, is another effective strategy for enhancing the production of secondary metabolites [49]. Tylosin biosynthesis is under the complex control of five cluster-situated regulators, among which TylR regulates the transcription of tylosin BGC directly [25]. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of tylR led to a moderate enhancement of tylosin production to 9.86 g/L (about 11% higher than that by TL01), although tylR was already expressed at a high level in the starting strain TL01.

In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of tylR led to a moderate enhancement of tylosin production to 9.86 g/L (about 11% higher than that by TL01), although tylR was already expressed at a high level in the starting strain TL01. Based on the above positive results, combination overexpression was the next rational step for further improving the titer. However, the simple combination of the SAM biosynthetic genes (metKcs, adoKcs, and metFcs), the tylosin efflux gene (tlrC), and the pathway-specific activator gene (tylR) failed to achieve a satisfying additive effect on the elevation of tylosin production. At first glance, this phenomenon was similar to a recent study performed in S. venezuelae, in which the engineering of multiple genes did not result in a synergic effect [26]. Our subsequent transcriptional analysis showed that the expression levels of tlrC and SAM biosynthetic genes in the combinatorial strain TLPH17 were lower than those in the singly overexpressed strains TLPH08-2 and TLPH11, respectively, which in turn resulted in poorer tylosin efflux in TLPH17 than in TLPH08-2 and poorer SAM supply than in TLPH11. We hypothesized that the presence of multiple strong constitutive promoters within a relatively narrow DNA region, such as in TLPH17, would possibly lead to detrimental competition for RNA polymerase among the corresponding transcriptional units. Subsequently, the expression levels of five target genes were fine-tuned by rearranging them into one or two transcripts in TLPH23 and TLPH24, resulting in a slight increase in the relative expression levels of tlrC and adoKcs compared to those in TLPH17 (Fig. 5). However, the transcriptional levels of five target genes were still lower than those of tlrC in TLPH08-2, SAM biosynthetic genes in TLPH11, and tylR in TLPH12. We speculated that the length of each transcription unit and the order of target genes might also be critical factors affecting the transcription levels, and more in-depth research is required to further coordinate the expression levels of the target genes.
