Echinomycin is a natural product DNA bisintercalator antibiotic. The echinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces lasalocidi includes a gene encoding the self-resistance protein Ecm16. Here, we present the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of Ecm16 bound to adenosine diphosphate. The structure of Ecm16 closely resembles that of UvrA, the DNA damage sensor component of the prokaryotic nucleotide excision repair system, but Ecm16 lacks the UvrB-binding domain and its associated zinc-binding module found in UvrA. Mutagenesis study revealed that the insertion domain of Ecm16 is required for DNA binding. Furthermore, the specific amino acid sequence of the insertion domain allows Ecm16 to distinguish echinomycin-bound DNA from normal DNA and link substrate binding to ATP hydrolysis activity. Expression of ecm16 in the heterologous host Brevibacillus choshinensis conferred resistance against echinomycin and other quinomycin antibiotics, including thiocoraline, quinaldopeptin, and sandramycin. Our study provides new insight into how the producers of DNA bisintercalator antibiotics fend off the toxic compounds that they produce. Subject terms Introduction Introduction Quinomycin antibiotics act by noncovalently binding to the DNA double helix1. They are DNA bisintercalators, compounds that bind reversibly to the DNA duplex by inserting a pair of aromatic ring groups in between adjacent base pairs of the DNA. There has been much interest in this family of compounds due to their potent antimicrobial and antitumor activity, culminating in a large body of biochemical, structural, and clinical knowledge2. However, mechanistic details about bacterial resistance against DNA bisintercalators remains limited. While no resistance element against these compounds has been discovered so far in pathogenic bacteria, it is prudent to identify and elucidate resistance mechanisms that are present in the natural environment. Knowledge of basic resistance mechanisms will allow researchers to develop new therapeutic strategies before quinomycin resistance becomes a clinical problem.

Knowledge of basic resistance mechanisms will allow researchers to develop new therapeutic strategies before quinomycin resistance becomes a clinical problem. Quinomycin antibiotic producers typically contain one or more self-resistance genes, which are found either within the antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster or elsewhere in the genome. For example, the triostin producing bacterium contains a gene that encodes for an ABC transporter3, and the thiocoraline producer contains genes that encode for an ABC transporter as well as a thiocoraline sequestration protein4,5, Interestingly, quinomycin producers also contain a gene for a UvrA-like protein in their biosynthetic gene cluster (Table 1). UvrA is a DNA repair enzyme from the universal prokaryotic nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Briefly, UvrA recognizes the DNA damage and recruits UvrB to the lesion site. UvrB recruits UvrC which cleaves the phosphodiester bond eight nucleotides upstream and up to five nucleotides downstream of the modified nucleotide. Next, UvrC recruits the UvrD helicase which displaces the cleaved DNA fragment. DNA polymerase I synthesizes the missing stretch of DNA using the undamaged complementary strand as a template and DNA ligase seals the breaks, thus completing the repair6.Table 1UvrA-like proteins expressed by producers of quinomycin antibiotics.ProteinNumber of residuesSpeciesConfers resistance againstaSequence identity to Ecm16Ecm16792Streptomyces lasaliensisEchinomycin–AcmrC756Streptomyces anulatusActinomycin D52.1%CmrX826Streptomyces griseusChromomycin A337.8%DrrC764Streptomyces peucetiusDoxorubicin51.2%MtrX828Streptomyces argillaceusMithramycin34.8%Swb15792Streptomyces sp.

Echinomycin is a prototypical DNA bisintercalator produced by multiple actinomycetes, including Streptomyces echinatus and Streptomyces lasalocidi (formerly known as S. lasaliensis)7–9. It is a cyclic depsipeptide that contains two quinoxaline groups and an unusual thioacetal bridge (Fig. 3)10. Echinomycin shows potent antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci11,12 but it is not used clinically due to solubility and toxicity issues. The echinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from S. lasalocidi contains genes that encode for enzymes that synthesize the quinoxaline group, enzymes that construct the peptide backbone, and genes that encode for proteins with unknown function13. One of the functionally uncharacterized proteins is Ecm16, which was postulated to provide self-protection against echinomycin based on the sequence identity (~ 30%) it shares with the prokaryotic UvrA proteins that function in the NER pathway13.

We have previously reported the in vivo and in vitro functional characterization of Ecm1614. The main findings of that study are (1) the echinomycin sensitive Escherichia coli K12 becomes echinomycin resistant upon transformation with the ecm16 encoding plasmid, (2) Ecm16 does not require participation of the NER proteins UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, or UvrD to provide echinomycin resistance, (3) Ecm16 does not complement UvrA function, (4) Ecm16’s ATPase activity is essential for its anti-echinomycin activity, (5) Ecm16 binds to double-stranded DNA in a nucleotide sequence independent manner, and (6) Ecm16 binds to echinomycin-containing DNA ~ two-fold more strongly than to echinomycin-free DNA. In the current study, we have determined the crystal structure of Ecm16 to provide a structural context to its function. We have also performed mutational studies to dissect the role of Ecm16’s insertion domain. In UvrA proteins, the insertion domain is involved in damage-specific DNA binding15. Lastly, we have probed the substrate specificity of Ecm16 by challenging ecm16-expressing cells with a series of quinomycin and non-quinomycin DNA targeting antibiotics.

Results Results X-ray crystal structure of Ecm16 X-ray crystal structure of Ecm16 X-ray crystal structure of Ecm16 We have determined the structure of Ecm16 bound to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at 2.0 Å resolution (Fig. 1a). Our final model consists of the Ecm16 homodimer, four ADP, two Mg2+, four Zn2+, and 612 water molecules (Table 2). Some residues, including 183-293 of chain A and 185-295 of chain B that includes the entire insertion domain, were not modelled due to missing electron density (Supplementary Table 1). Each protomer of Ecm16 contains two ABC ATPase motifs, referred to as nucleotide-binding domain I and II (NBD-I and NBD-II). NBD-I consists of the ATP-binding I domain, signature I domain, and insertion domain. The insertion domain was not visible in the crystal structure, presumably because it is disordered. NBD-II consists of the ATP-binding II domain and the signature II domain. NBD-II is missing the helix-turn-strand that corresponds to residue 66-99 of NBD-I (Supplementary Fig. 1). Other than these two differences, NBD-I and NBD-II have a relatively similar overall structure (RMSD = 1.5 Å for 208 Cα atoms). The dimer interface of Ecm16 buries ~ 3900 Å2 of surface area and is comprised of residues from the ATP-binding I, signature I, and signature II domains (Supplementary Fig. 2). The ventral side of Ecm16 features an extended groove that is lined with numerous basic residues (K136, K143, K381, R384, R567, K568, R537, K549, K572, K577) (Supplementary Fig. 3). This ~ 10 nm long and ~ 2 nm wide groove can potentially accommodate a ~ 32 bp B-form DNA and provides a structural basis for the previously reported DNA-binding activity of Ecm1614.Figure 1Crystal structure of Ecm16.

Ecm16 has a total of four nucleotide-binding sites, two proximal and two distal nucleotide-binding sites (Fig. 1a). The proximal nucleotide-binding site is located ~ 19 Å from the Ecm16 dimer interface and it is sandwiched between ATP-binding domain I and signature domain II. The distal nucleotide-binding site is located ~ 26 Å from the dimer interface and it is sandwiched between ATP-binding domain II and signature domain I. Each ATP-binding domain contains a Walker A motif, Walker B motif, and the α-helical ABC signature subdomain containing the LSGGQ sequence typically found in ABC transporters16 and DNA repair proteins17. The ATP-binding and signature domains are connected by the Q-loop, which is the site of major conformational change and coupling of energy converting domains of NBD on other ATPases18. Electron density at both the proximal and distal nucleotide-binding sites showed the presence of ADP (Supplementary Fig. 4). To further confirm the identity of the nucleotide bound to Ecm16, we performed liquid chromatography analysis of the protein extract. Only ADP was detected in this experiment (Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating that the nucleotide observed in the Ecm16 crystal structure is ADP, and not ATP.

Only ADP was detected in this experiment (Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating that the nucleotide observed in the Ecm16 crystal structure is ADP, and not ATP. Mg2+ ions are observed only at the two proximal nucleotide-binding sites, and not at the distal sites, even though Ecm16 was crystallized in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2 (Fig. 1b, c). The reason for this is not clear but a similar observation was made for the crystal structure of UvrA from Bacillus stearothermophilus19. The phosphate groups of ADP participate in an extensive hydrogen bond network involving the residues of the Walker A motif, while the ribose sugar and adenine base form relatively few interactions with Ecm16. The conserved histidine residue at position 501 stacks well against the adenine ring of ADP at the distal site. Each Ecm16 protomer contains two zinc-binding modules, which correspond to the UvrA zinc-binding module 2 and 3 observed in all UvrA crystal structures reported so far. In module 2, Zn2+ is coordinated to C176, C179, C296, and C299, while in module 3, Zn2+ is coordinated to C589, C592, C612, and C615 (Fig. 1d). These zinc-coordinating residues are conserved in UvrA and UvrA2 proteins14,15.

These zinc-coordinating residues are conserved in UvrA and UvrA2 proteins14,15. The three-dimensional structure of Ecm16 resembles that of UvrA from B. stearothermophilus (RMSD = 2.6 Å for 1002 Cα atoms) and UvrA2 from Deinococcus radiodurans (RMSD = 1.7 Å for 933 Cα atoms) (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 6). The structural similarity of Ecm16, UvrA, and UvrA2 explains their common functionalities such as DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis15,20. However, Ecm16, like UvrA2, lacks the UvrB-binding domain and its associated zinc-binding module 1 which are found in all UvrA proteins, indicating that Ecm16 does not interact with UvrB from the NER pathway. This is consistent with our previous report that both the wild type and the UvrB knockout strains of E. coli K12 became resistant to echinomycin upon induction of expression of ecm16 encoded in trans14.

Insertion domain is required for DNA binding activity of Ecm16 Insertion domain is required for DNA binding activity of Ecm16 Insertion domain is required for DNA binding activity of Ecm16 The insertion domain of UvrA and UvrA2 have been proposed to contribute to binding of the DNA substrate15,20,21. To test whether the insertion domain of Ecm16 is required for DNA binding, we prepared Ecm16-ΔID in which the insertion domain was replaced with a glycine-serine linker (Supplementary Figs. 7, 8). We monitored the binding of Ecm16 and Ecm16-ΔID to a 32-bp DNA that contains a single echinomycin binding site (Supplementary Table 2). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that Ecm16 bound more tightly to echinomycin-bound DNA than normal DNA, whereas Ecm16-ΔID did not bind to either type of DNA (Fig. 2a). Next, we measured the DNA binding affinity of Ecm16 and Ecm16-ΔID using fluorescence polarization. The dissociation constant for Ecm16-DNA-echinomycin and Ecm16-DNA was 11.8 nM and 60.2 nM, respectively (Fig. 2b, Table 3). For Ecm16-ΔID, no binding was observed for either DNA substrate. Therefore, EMSA and fluorescence polarization both showed that the insertion domain of Ecm16 is required for DNA binding.Figure 2The insertion domain of Ecm16 is required for echinomycin resistance.

Next, we prepared Ecm16* in which the insertion domain of Ecm16 was exchanged with the insertion domain of DrrC, an Ecm16 homolog from Streptomyces peucetius (Supplementary Figs. 7, 8). DrrC was reported to confer resistance against the DNA monointercalator antibiotic daunorubicin, although the molecular mechanism of DrrC is not known22. The insertion domain of Ecm16 and DrrC share 32% amino acid sequence identity. Ecm16* bound to echinomycin-containing DNA 2.4-fold more tightly than to normal DNA (KD = 37.7 nM vs. 90.8 nM) (Fig. 2b, Table 3). This result indicates that having a homologous insertion domain is sufficient for Ecm16 to distinguish echinomycin-bound DNA from normal DNA through differential binding. To investigate whether Ecm16* has anti-echinomycin activity, E. coli K12 cells expressing Ecm16* were challenged with 10 µM echinomycin. Ecm16* expressing cells were sensitive to echinomycin (Fig. 2d), indicating that the native insertion domain must be present to provide anti-echinomycin activity.

DNA-echinomycin stimulates the ATP hydrolysis activity of Ecm16 DNA-echinomycin stimulates the ATP hydrolysis activity of Ecm16 DNA-echinomycin stimulates the ATP hydrolysis activity of Ecm16 We reported previously that the ATP hydrolysis activity of Ecm16 is required to render echinomycin resistance in vivo14. Because Ecm16* bound preferentially to echinomycin-containing DNA yet it failed to confer echinomycin resistance, we predicted that Ecm16* could not hydrolyze ATP. To test this idea, we measured the ATP hydrolysis activity of Ecm16, Ecm16-ΔID, Ecm16*, and UvrA in the presence of drug-free DNA, echinomycin-bound DNA, fluorescein-modified DNA, and doxorubicin-bound DNA (Supplementary Table 2). Echinomycin-bound DNA is the presumed native substrate of Ecm16, fluorescein-modified DNA mimics UV-damaged DNA and is a known substrate for UvrA but not Ecm1614,20, and doxorubicin-bound DNA is the presumed substrate for DrrC23. The ATP hydrolysis activity of Ecm16 increased by 16-fold in the presence of echinomycin-bound DNA but not other DNA substrates we tested (Fig. 2c). Ecm16* and UvrA showed a similar basal ATPase activity for all four DNA substrates. Ecm16-ΔID displayed no significant ATP hydrolysis activity for all DNA substrates (Supplementary Fig. 10), which is consistent with the inability of Ecm16ΔID to bind DNA (Fig. 2a, b). These results indicate that only the native DNA substrate stimulates the ATP hydrolysis activity of Ecm16 and that this property is lost when the insertion domain is deleted or when it is substituted with the insertion domain of a homologous protein. Therefore, the insertion domain plays an important role in determining Ecm16’s substrate specificity and in supporting Ecm16’s anti-echinomycin activity.

Ecm16 provides resistance against a variety of quinomycin antibiotics Ecm16 provides resistance against a variety of quinomycin antibiotics Ecm16 provides resistance against a variety of quinomycin antibiotics We probed the substrate specificity of Ecm16 by testing whether Ecm16 can provide resistance against other DNA-binding drug molecules—doxorubicin, mitomycin C, daunorubicin, actinomycin D, cisplatin, thiocoraline, quinaldopeptin, and sandramycin. Because the permeability of these compounds is limited in Gram negative (diderm) bacteria, we used the Gram positive (monoderm) bacterium Brevibacillus choshinensis, instead of E. coli K12. Ecm16-expressing B. choshinensis cells displayed resistance only against the DNA bisintercalator antibiotics echinomycin, thiocoraline, quinaldopeptin, and sandramycin (Fig. 3). The degree of resistance provided by Ecm16 was most pronounced at the highest antibiotic concentration tested. Cells containing the control vector grew very slowly in the presence of 0.1 µM echinomycin, 4 uM thiocoraline, 6 µM quinaldopeptin, or 2 µM sandramycin making it impossible to determine the doubling time, whereas cells expressing Ecm16 had doubling times which were more similar to cells which were not treated with the respective antibiotic (only 1.1- to 1.2-fold longer) (Fig. 3). Our result showed that Ecm16 is most effective against echinomycin, but it also provides some resistance against other structurally similar quinomycin antibiotics.Figure 3Growth curve study of B. choshinensis strains with pNI vector-control-only (VCO) or ecm16_pNI plasmid.

Ecm16 is a homolog of UvrA, the DNA damage sensor protein from the prokaryotic NER pathway. The main structural difference between Ecm16 and UvrA is that Ecm16 lacks the UvrB-binding domain and a zinc-binding module which are present in all UvrA structures reported to date (PDB ID: 2R6F, 3PIH, 3UWX, 3UX8, 3ZQJ, 6N9L). Another potential structural difference is the conformation of the ~ 100 residue insertion domain, although this remains to be verified since the insertion domain is not visible in the Ecm16 crystal structure, presumably because this domain is mobile in the absence of a bound DNA substrate. Overall, the three-dimensional structure of Ecm16 and UvrA are highly similar. They share the same protein fold and they both contain four ATP-binding sites and one continuous DNA-binding groove. Accordingly, Ecm16 and UvrA both display ATPase activity and bind double-stranded DNA14. However, Ecm16 lacks the UvrB-binding domain and its associated zinc-binding module, suggesting that Ecm16 and UvrA have distinct molecular mechanisms acquired potentially through divergent evolution.

Ecm16ΔID, which lacks the insertion domain, failed to bind DNA. Furthermore, expression of Ecm16ΔID in E. coli K12 did not protect the cells from echinomycin. Ecm16*, which possesses the insertion domain from the daunorubicin resistance protein DrrC, showed 2.4-fold higher binding affinity to echinomycin-bound DNA than normal DNA. However, Ecm16*, in contrast to Ecm16, did not display the dramatic increase in ATP hydrolysis rate in the presence of echinomycin-containing DNA. Based on these results, we propose a two-step model for detection of echinomycin-bound DNA by Ecm16. In the first step, Ecm16 discriminates echinomycin-bound DNA from normal DNA by differential DNA binding affinity. This initial screening step requires the presence of the insertion domain independent of sequence. In the second step, Ecm16-bound DNA substrates are further discriminated by their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of Ecm16. This second step appears to require an insertion domain that is specifically matched to echinomycin. Additional structural studies are needed to determine how these two steps are achieved at the molecular level. In particular, atomic structure of Ecm16 in complex with echinomycin-bound DNA and with echinomycin-free DNA will help decipher the molecular mechanism. Interestingly, Ecm16 also provided protection against the natural product DNA bisintercalators thiocoraline, quinaldopeptin, and sandramycin. This is reminiscent of UvrA protein’s ability to detect a wide variety of DNA lesions. Ecm16ΔID, which lacks the insertion domain, failed to bind DNA.

Understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms is important because it enables the development of new therapeutic strategies. Our work has started to unravel a potentially novel antibiotic resistance mechanism, but further studies are needed to fully understand how Ecm16 confers echinomycin resistance. This includes determining the structure of Ecm16 bound to various DNA substrates and identifying, if any, Ecm16’s partner proteins. Assuming Ecm16 requires partner proteins, they are likely to be proteins which are conserved throughout different phylogenetic lineages since Ecm16 confers echinomycin resistance when expressed in three distantly related organisms, S. lasalocidi, E. coli, and B. choshinensis.

Briefly, 100 ng of plasmid mixed with solution A (Takara Bio) was added to the competent B. choshinensis cell pellet and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Next, PEG containing solution B was added, vortexed, and centrifuged. Cell pellet was resuspended in MT media, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were then plated on MT agar plates containing neomycin (50 µg ml−1) and cultured overnight at 37 °C. 4–5 colonies were inoculated in 3 ml 2SYNm liquid medium and grown at 30 °C for 48 h with orbital shaking at 120 rpm. The cells were centrifuged, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1× phosphate (100 mM Sodium phosphate at pH 7.0) buffer. Expression of Ecm16 in B. choshinensis was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis.
