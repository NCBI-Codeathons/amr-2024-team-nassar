 The rapid development
of antibiotic resistance, especially among
difficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacteria, is recognized as a serious
and urgent threat to public health. The detection and characterization
of novel resistance mechanisms are essential to better predict the
spread and evolution of antibiotic resistance. Corramycin is a novel
and modified peptidic antibiotic with activity against several Gram-negative
pathogens. We demonstrate that the kinase ComG, part of the corramycin
biosynthetic gene cluster, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates
corramycin, leading to the resistance of the host. Remarkably, we
found that the closest structural homologues of ComG are aminoglycoside
phosphotransferases; however, ComG shows no activity toward this class
of antibiotics. The crystal structure of ComG in complex with corramycin
reveals that corramycin adopts a β-hairpin-like structure and
allowed us to define the changes leading to a switch in substrate
from sugar to peptide. Bioinformatic analyses suggest a limited occurrence
of ComG-like proteins, which along with the absence of cross-resistance
to clinically used drugs positions corramycin as an attractive antibiotic
for further development. Introduction Introduction The spread of antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) represents one of
the principal public health problems of this century and has consequently
been declared as one of the top 10 global public health threats by
the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019.1,2 Infections
with Gram-negative bacteria, in particular those included in the list
of ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus
aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter
baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) pathogens, are a major concern due to
their tendency to acquire multidrug resistance.3,4 Research
efforts have thus largely focused on the development of new bioactive
compounds against Gram-negative bacteria, ideally addressing innovative
targets.5,6 The spread of antimicrobial resistance

metabolism of myxobacteria,
δ-proteobacteria known for their complex life cycle and social
behavior, has resulted in the isolation of natural products exhibiting
high chemical diversity and unusual modes of action.7Corallococcus coralloides species are
the producers of the natural products corramycins, which were isolated
in an activity-guided isolation process aiming to identify novel chemical
scaffolds exhibiting activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Corramycins
(Figure 1A) are linear,
peptidic natural products harboring several modified amino acids as
well as an N-terminal butyric acid and a thus far undescribed γ-N-methyl-β-OH-histidine.8,9 The biosynthetic
gene cluster (BGC) responsible for the production of corramycins was
identified as a 12-modular hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase
(NRPS)–polyketide synthase (PKS) megasynthetase assembly line
organized in one operon (Figure 1B). The major product of this BGC exhibited substantial
antimicrobial activity against different Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Escherichia coli NCTC13441 = 4 μg mL–1) and was active in a first in vivo proof of concept
study in rodents.8 A hydroxylated derivative
and a derivative with additional glycosylation were isolated as side
products (Figure 1A).
The mode of action of corramycins is still elusive, but given their
potency and spectrum, we investigated how the producing organism had
established self-resistance and whether the underlying resistance
mechanism is already present among bacteria. The investigation of the specialized

directly linked
to the BGC encoding the biosynthesis is a common feature of microbial
natural product production.10 This fact
has even been exploited in the search for new natural products in
the so-called self-resistance-guided genome mining.11 The understanding of the underlying mechanisms of bacterial
resistance against antibiotics as well as their epidemiological distribution
is vital to develop successful counterstrategies as early as possible
in the drug development process. In general, the most common mechanisms
of AMR by prokaryotes include enzymatic inactivation, target modification,
porin defects, and overexpression of efflux transporters.12,13 Genes related to self-resistance mechanisms being

of high
clinical relevance due to their bactericidal activity and broad-spectrum
profiles. Aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APHs), which phosphorylate
specific hydroxyl groups in aminoglycosides, are very effective inactivators
of this class of antibiotics.14,15 Although other resistance
mechanisms against aminoglycosides can occur, the synthesis of aminoglycoside-modifying
enzymes (AMEs) is the predominant mode of resistance in clinical isolates.
The evolutionary success of AMEs is attributed to the ability of most
enzymes to act on more than one aminoglycoside in addition to their
frequent occurrence on mobile genetic elements, increasing their likelihood
of dissemination among species.16 Intriguingly,
there have been scarce reports of enzymes with a substrate range beyond
the aminoglycosides such as the kinase Cph, which confers self-resistance
to the peptide-based antibiotic capreomycin.17 Capreomycin, viomycin, and derivatives thereof constitute the antibiotic
class of tuberactinomycins, which represent effective treatments against
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB).18 In another case, there are reports of low-level resistance to the
structurally very different class of fluoroquinolones conferred by
the acetylation of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin by an enzyme related
to an APH.19,20 Consequently, there have been
hypotheses that aminoglycoside phosphotransferases and common kinases
evolved from a mutual ancestor and share a general kinase fold and
kinetic mechanism.15 Aminoglycosides, such as tobramycin and gentamicin (Figure 1C), are antibiotics

the kinase ComG from the corramycin BGC as
a self-resistance factor of C. coralloides. We demonstrate
that the expression of ComG leads to resistance in E. coli. The reconstitution of the ComG activity in vitro allowed us to pinpoint the position of phosphorylation on the corramycin
backbone. The crystal structure of ComG in complex with corramycin
revealed an unexpected β-hairpin-like conformation of the natural
product and shed light on the catalytic mechanism. Importantly, ComG-like
enzymes were not found widely distributed among bacteria, and related
aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes do not confer resistance to corramycin,
indicating little pre-existing resistance and, thus, showing great
potential for corramycin to be developed as a novel class of antibiotics. Herein, we describe

belong to the modular hybrid PKS/NRPS assembly line and the corresponding
tailoring genes for the biosynthesis of the natural product (Figure 1B). In the search

protein sequences database using blastP and ComG as a query revealed
that its closest homologues are kinases conferring resistance to aminoglycoside
antibiotics. We did not observe any shift in the inhibitory concentration
of reference antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, for ComG-expressing E. coli (Table S1). Thus, ComG
cannot confer resistance to members of this antibiotic class, suggesting
rather poor structural homology between the substrate binding site
of ComG and those of other aminoglycoside kinases. Based on this finding,

conferred resistance to E.
coli, we attempted to reconstitute this activity in vitro. The enzyme was expressed in E. coli Lemo21 (DE3) and purified to homogeneity (Figure S2A), and analysis of ComG using intact protein mass spectrometry
showed very good agreement between observed and calculated mass (mobs = 40,949.37 Da, mcalc = 40,949.97 Da, Figure S2B). Upon incubation
of corramycin with ComG in the presence of ATP and MgCl2 at 22 °C, we observed a mass shift of +79.97 Da, corresponding
to the addition of a phosphate group (Figure 2A). As expected, no substrate conversion
was observed without the addition of ATP (Figure S3). Interestingly, ComG heavily favors ATP over GTP as the
phosphate donor for its catalytic function (Figure S4), which is in contrast to the capreomycin kinase Cph, which
shows comparable conversion for both nucleotides.17 In addition, the enzyme kinetics for the reaction of ComG
with ATP were analyzed for a series of corramycin concentrations,
and Km and kcat values were determined to be 33 μM and 1 min–1, respectively (Figure S5). After we observed that ComG

ComG contained two protomers in the asymmetric unit, and the refined
model encompassed residues 14–33, 39–57, and 66–364
for chain A (13–33, 40–56, and 66–364 for chain
B). The enzyme adopts the typical bilobed kinase fold, with the N-terminal
lobe being formed primarily by β-sheets, while the C-terminal
lobe consists predominantly of α-helices (Figure 3A). The ATP-binding hinge region is found
in the loop between the two lobes, with the conserved glycine residue
leading to the parallel orientation of the backbone, which in turn
is expected to coordinate the adenine of ATP. On the opposing side
of the hinge region lies the “DFG loop”, which in ComG
is mutated to a DFE motif (Figure S8).
The conserved aspartate residue is critical for the coordination of
the magnesium cation and, thus, for the orientation of the phosphate
region of ATP. The surface representation of ComG revealed a wide
pocket between the N- and C-terminal lobes that appeared suitable
to accommodate a larger natural product (Figure 3B). In addition, residues on both sides of
the pocket extending toward the solvent could possibly act as a closing
lid above both the substrate and cofactor binding sites. Apo

is expected to coordinate the adenine of ATP. On the opposing side
of the hinge region lies the “DFG loop”, which in ComG
is mutated to a DFE motif (Figure S8).
The conserved aspartate residue is critical for the coordination of
the magnesium cation and, thus, for the orientation of the phosphate
region of ATP. The surface representation of ComG revealed a wide
pocket between the N- and C-terminal lobes that appeared suitable
to accommodate a larger natural product (Figure 3B). In addition, residues on both sides of
the pocket extending toward the solvent could possibly act as a closing
lid above both the substrate and cofactor binding sites. Apo
ComG contained two protomers in the asymmetric unit, and the refined
model encompassed residues 14–33, 39–57, and 66–364
for chain A (13–33, 40–56, and 66–364 for chain
B). The enzyme adopts the typical bilobed kinase fold, with the N-terminal
lobe being formed primarily by β-sheets, while the C-terminal
lobe consists predominantly of α-helices (Figure 3A). The ATP-binding hinge region is found
in the loop between the two lobes, with the conserved glycine residue
leading to the parallel orientation of the backbone, which in turn
is expected to coordinate the adenine of ATP. On the opposing side
of the hinge region lies the “DFG loop”, which in ComG

the DALI server
revealed an uncharacterized kinase (PDB ID 3csv) as the closest hit with a Cα RMSD of 4.0 Å and 79% sequence coverage. The closest structural
homologue for which the structure had been determined with a bound
substrate was aminoglycoside 7″-phosphotransferase-Ia, which
phosphorylates and thereby inactivates the aminoglycoside antibiotic
hygromycin B (PDB ID 6IY9) (Figure S9). The overall structural
homology is fair, with a Cα RMSD of 3.73 Å,
but only just over half of the Cα atoms could be
aligned structurally (52%). The poor structural homology was somewhat
expected, since ComG acts on a peptidic substrate and led us to pursue
crystallization of the ComG–corramycin complex. A search for structural homologues of ComG using

was incubated with a 5-fold molar excess of corramycin,
a 10-fold molar excess of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPCP,
and MgCl2 for 24 h at 4 °C before crystallization
trials were attempted. ComG complex crystals (ComGC) were
observed in multiple conditions and also belonged to space group P21, and a data set was processed to a resolution
of 1.5 Å. The structure of ComGC was determined by
molecular replacement using the ComG structure as a search model.
Interestingly, the addition of corramycin led to a significant difference
in crystal packing, as ComGC only had a single protomer
in the asymmetric unit, and the pathology observed for ComG crystals
was no longer present. Binding of corramycin did not lead to notable
movement in the structure of ComG when comparing apo and complex structures
(Cα RMSD of 0.35 Å), with the exception of the
loop connecting residues 33 and 39, which is ordered in the ComGC structure. This is likely a direct result of a hydrogen bond
between corramycin and Arg38 (Figure S10). To this end, ComG

in a pocket formed between the N- and C-terminal lobes but could not
observe any density for AMPPCP/Mg2+ (Figures 3C and S10). Unexpectedly,
the three-dimensional structure of corramycin was reminiscent of two
antiparallel β-strands, which adopt a β-hairpin-like structure
that is stabilized by six intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Figures 3D and S11). The turn of the hairpin is composed of
the N-methyl-phenylalanine, the side chain of which
is bound in a hydrophobic pocket, and part of the hydroxylated γ-amino
valeroyl moiety, which is also the site of corramycin phosphorylation
by ComG. This region of corramycin is further stabilized by two hydrogen
bonds between the natural product and ComG (Figure S12). Interestingly, the position of this moiety at the turn,
the site of phosphorylation, leads to a conformation that could be
viewed as mimicking a hexose (Figure 3D), with both hydroxyl groups pointing toward the putative

with peptide-based
natural products have been reported only once, for the capreomycin
kinase Cph.17 Even though the bilobed architecture
of both enzymes is somewhat similar, the overall structural homology
is low (Cα RMSD of 6.22 Å) and, thus, even lower
than the homology to the more unrelated APHs (Figure S13). The biggest structural differences are the absence
of two C-terminal ComG loops and one α-helix (residues 285–315
and 345–364) in Cph, which are crucial for the formation of
the hydrophobic pocket and, therefore, for corramycin binding. In
contrast, the characteristic macrocycle of capreomycin is extending
into the helical architecture of the C-terminal lobe, leading to the
compound adopting a “C” shape.17 Intriguingly, this conformation is also the result of multiple intramolecular
hydrogen bonds. Somewhat expected based on these results, we were
unable to detect any phosphorylation of capreomycin by ComG, which
highlights the structural differences of the substrate binding pocket

the Catalytic Center Modeling of
the Catalytic Center Despite adding a 10-fold
molar excess of AMPPCP/MgCl2, we did not observe convincing
electron density for the ATP analogue in the complex structure. This
may be due to a rather mediocre affinity or the fact that corramycin
binding in the active site with a high affinity occluded AMPPCP from
the pocket during the crystallization process. To better understand
the catalytic mechanism, we set out to model ATP into our complex
structure using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As an initial
step, one ATP and one Mg2+ were placed at the presumed
ATP-binding site of ComG (hinge region, DFE motif). Next, the system
was minimized, equilibrated, and simulated for 100 ns. In our simulations,
the adenine group of ATP established an H-bond with the backbone carbonyl
oxygen of Leu100 from the hinge region (Figure S15). The Mg2+ center is hexacoordinated with an
octahedral geometry, the most usual coordination for Mg2+ in biological macromolecules,21 which
was previously described for an aminoglycoside kinase.22 According to our simulations, Mg2+ is coordinated by two oxygens of the side chains of Asp220 and Glu222
from the DFE loop of ComG and by the triphosphate group of ATP (Figure 4). Despite ATP acting
as a ligand in both of the simulations, in one of them, it acted as
a tridentate ligand (production 1) and in the other as a bidentate
ligand (production 2, Figure 4C). The coordination with Glu222 is very stable and was observed
in both of our simulations; Asp220, however, acted as a ligand in
only one of our simulations (production 1, Figure 4D). Despite adding a 10-fold

of ComG
by comparing the modeled ATP pose to that of bound nucleotides in
other APHs (Pfam family PF01636, Table S6). Although sequence conservation in this family is low, the amino
acid pattern in ComG indicates a larger similarity to the ATP binding
pocket in other kinases (Figure S16). Furthermore, we analyzed the cofactor binding preferences

In fact, in one of our simulations (production 2), Mg2+ is coordinated with three water molecules for the full 100 ns of
our simulation (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the orientation of the N-terminal chain of corramycin
also seems to be important for its interaction with ATP, as depicted
in the comparison between the position of corramycin after 90 ns of
simulation in productions 1 and 2 (Figure S17). We also followed the distance between the oxygen of the C3-hydroxyl group derived from the carboxy group of β-alanine
from corramycin and the terminal phosphate from ATP along the simulated
time (Figure S18), and all simulation data
agree with experimental observation. The role of the water molecules in the coordination of the Mg2+ center is also important, at least as a transient ligand.

occurring resistance is a major concern in the exploration of novel
potential antibiotics. We thus performed a thorough bioinformatic
analysis to explore the evolutionary spread of potential resistance
mediated by ComG-like proteins through genome mining in the order Myxococcales and the phylum Actinobacteria (Figure S19). In the Myxococcales, we only found one homologue with high sequence identity on the
protein level (72.5%, Figure S1) in three
identical NRPS/T1PKS-type clusters in Myxococcus llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogochensis, Myxococcus guangdongensis, and Myxococcus sp. CA040A (Figure S19). In Actinobacteria, we found several homologues with a relatively low sequence identity
(25–30%) but good coverage (sequence similarity observed over
>75% of the entire ComG length) in BGCs of very different types,
ranging
from aryl polyene to NRPS and siderophores. These data may indicate
other instances in which aminoglycoside-like phosphotransferases acquired
a substrate range that is broader than aminoglycoside antibiotics,
but experimental verification will be required before firm conclusions
can be drawn. Naturally

identical NRPS/T1PKS-type clusters in Myxococcus llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogochensis, Myxococcus guangdongensis, and Myxococcus sp. CA040A (Figure S19). In Actinobacteria, we found several homologues with a relatively low sequence identity
(25–30%) but good coverage (sequence similarity observed over
>75% of the entire ComG length) in BGCs of very different types,
ranging
from aryl polyene to NRPS and siderophores. These data may indicate
other instances in which aminoglycoside-like phosphotransferases acquired
a substrate range that is broader than aminoglycoside antibiotics,
but experimental verification will be required before firm conclusions
can be drawn. Naturally
occurring resistance is a major concern in the exploration of novel
potential antibiotics. We thus performed a thorough bioinformatic
analysis to explore the evolutionary spread of potential resistance
mediated by ComG-like proteins through genome mining in the order Myxococcales and the phylum Actinobacteria (Figure S19). In the Myxococcales, we only found one homologue with high sequence identity on the

order to further characterize potential pre-existing corramycin
resistance in bacteria, we explored the phylogenetic spread of ComG-like
enzymes, irrespective of their position in BGCs. ComG belongs to the
phosphotransferase enzyme family APH (Pfam family PF01636). However,
this domain does not extend to the C-terminal region of the protein,
comprising positions 285–315 (Figure 5A), which is crucial for corramycin binding.
Thus, most proteins in this family are likely incapable of binding
corramycin. In

APHs, we
searched for homologues of ComG with BLAST and filtered them in such
a way that the sequence similarity extended into the corramycin-binding
C-terminal region. This yielded 202 proteins, predominantly phosphotransferases
from Myxococcota and Actinomycetota and kinases and hypothetical proteins in other phyla from the Terrabacteria group such as Armatimonada, Bacillota, Cyanobacteriota, and Chloroflexota, as well as from a candidate
phylum Rokubacteria. The corramycin kinase lies on
a branch separated from other myxobacteria, with four proteins from Myxococcus sp. CA040A, M. llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogochensis, and M. guangdongensis that are annotated as phosphotransferases
or aminoglycoside phosphotransferase family proteins. In these species,
the ComG homologue is embedded in a BGC that is very similar to the
corramycin BGC. A distant branch corresponds to GNAT family N-acetyltransferases from Legionella spp.
and several other closely related proteins from Pseudomonadota (Figure 5B). Analysis
of conservation of corramycin-binding residues in these proteins shows
a reasonable conservation within the phosphotransferase domain but
a severe drop of conservation in the corramycin-binding C-terminal
region, spanning positions 285–315 (Figure 5C). Structural analysis shows that this region
is crucial for binding of corramycin. These data indicate that ComG

pathogenic bacteria, we searched the CARD database (Comprehensive
Antibiotic Resistance Database23) for homologues
of ComG, but in none of these hits did homology expand to the corramycin-binding
C-terminal part. Together with an overall low homology, we propose
that these proteins do not confer corramycin resistance. When we further
analyzed the ESKAPE pathogens, we found five hits that were deemed
significant and fell within the CARD branch of the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 5B). Based
on their taxonomic diversity, three genes were cloned, expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Figure S20), and tested for their activity toward corramycin. As expected and
unlike ComG, we observed no MIC shift for the three tested ComG homologues,
and they thus do not confer resistance to corramycin (Table S7). In order to identify potential naturally occurring resistance in

imipenem and colistin, corramycin was the only antibiotic that remained
active, irrespective of the resistance mechanism, indicating that

APH(3′)-Ia
displayed resistance to corramycin (MIC > 64 μg mL–1). Nevertheless, we can exclude the involvement of the phosphotransferase,
as corramycin maintained activity against other isolates expressing
the same APH variant. The majority of the tested isolates are multidrug-resistant
(Table 1, Table S9); thus, it appears likely that the loss
of susceptibility is caused by a distinct mechanism. To identify the
culprit of resistance, we carefully reassessed the genome of the isolate
with a particular focus on the sbmA gene. We have
previously described that mutations of SbmA, a transporter responsible
for the uptake of the antibiotic in E. coli, can
confer resistance to corramycin.8 Strikingly,
we found a point mutation in the sbmA gene resulting
in a premature stop codon and, hence, a truncated protein. We further
assessed the susceptibility of the uptake-deficient strain in M9 minimal
medium and found that corramycin activity was restored with an MIC
of 1 μg mL–1. This result supports our hypothesis
of SbmA inactivation being the root of resistance in E. coli, as corramycin uses an additional uptake system under minimal conditions
and does not solely rely on SbmA. We have previously demonstrated
that single SbmA mutations, despite conferring resistance in vitro, may not necessarily translate into a loss of efficacy in vivo.8 These findings, coupled
with the absence of cross-resistance to clinically used drugs, highlight
the potential of corramycin in overcoming drug resistance. Remarkably, one of the clinical isolates expressing

mechanisms plays
a vital role in controlling the spread of AMR and its associated problems
for human health. This is especially true for compounds active against
Gram-negative bacteria, as infections caused by such pathogens are
generally more difficult to cure due to limited treatment options.
Novel antibiotics with innovative targets are needed. The development
of such is, however, time-consuming and expensive,26,27 which makes the early, thorough understanding of resistance mechanisms
and their spread among pathogenic bacteria a very high priority. The in-depth study of antibiotic self-resistance

Novel antibiotics with innovative targets are needed. The development
of such is, however, time-consuming and expensive,26,27 which makes the early, thorough understanding of resistance mechanisms
and their spread among pathogenic bacteria a very high priority. Besides self-resistance mechanisms of tuberactinomycins,17 ComG is the first kinase within the APH enzyme
family able to modify and inactivate a peptidic antibiotic. Unlike
the capreomycin kinase Cph, however, ComG shows cofactor specificity
toward ATP and adopts a unique 3D-fold tailored toward corramycin
binding. It was particularly surprising to discover that corramycin
adopts a β-hairpin-like structure, which in turn allows the
part of the molecule that is modified by ComG to mimic a sugar. It
is unclear whether the active conformation of corramycin, or indeed
its solution structure, reflects that of corramycin bound to ComG.
Stabilization of the conformation observed in the ComGC crystal structure by six hydrogen bonds, combined with the presence
of the α-N-methylated phenylalanine at the
β-hairpin turn, may be sufficient to stabilize the conformation
in solution. The presence of a special “C”-shaped conformation
of capreomycin, which is also the result of intramolecular hydrogen
bonds, may hint at an evolutionary design for peptide antibiotics.
Corramycin appears to combine two very important areas of medicinal
chemistry in one molecule: β-hairpins and carbohydrate-mimetic
peptides. It may therefore serve as a valuable starting point for
future synthetic efforts to develop bioactive molecules featuring
either one or both elements. Besides self-resistance mechanisms of tuberactinomycins,17 ComG is the first kinase within the APH enzyme

by ComG on target engagement
by the antibiotic remains elusive, but we view it as probable that,
analogously to aminoglycoside antibiotics, binding to the target is
abolished by phosphorylation. A potential mode of dephosphorylation
as activation mechanism has yet to be analyzed, but without a suitable
gene product in the corramycin BGC, it may either occur spontaneously
or, more likely, be the result of generic phosphatases. It remains
unclear whether phosphorylation is the main way by which the producing
strain protects itself against corramycin. We have previously hypothesized
that corramycin may be produced as a fatty acid-linked pro-drug that
is exported and subsequently hydrolyzed in the periplasm similar to
the description of the myxobacterial natural product vioprolide.8,28 Thus, ComG might only function as a highly efficient fail-safe in
case of a “production error” or unintentional import
of released corramycin, ultimately eliminating the need for a reactivation
mechanism. The effect of corramycin phosphorylation
by ComG on target engagement
by the antibiotic remains elusive, but we view it as probable that,
analogously to aminoglycoside antibiotics, binding to the target is
abolished by phosphorylation. A potential mode of dephosphorylation
as activation mechanism has yet to be analyzed, but without a suitable
gene product in the corramycin BGC, it may either occur spontaneously
or, more likely, be the result of generic phosphatases. It remains
unclear whether phosphorylation is the main way by which the producing
strain protects itself against corramycin. We have previously hypothesized
that corramycin may be produced as a fatty acid-linked pro-drug that
is exported and subsequently hydrolyzed in the periplasm similar to
the description of the myxobacterial natural product vioprolide.8,28 Thus, ComG might only function as a highly efficient fail-safe in
case of a “production error” or unintentional import
of released corramycin, ultimately eliminating the need for a reactivation
mechanism. Since phosphorylation is a very effective way to
neutralize antibiotics,
we performed genome mining studies to analyze the spread of potential
ComG homologues. The results were very promising in that the spread
is limited and mostly restricted to predicted biosynthetic gene clusters.
Critically, no presence on mobile genetic elements could be determined,
and our data indicate a rather narrow substrate range of ComG with
no activity detected on aminoglycosides, macrolides, fluoroquinolones,
and the peptide antibiotic capreomycin. We further characterized the
activity of corramycin against multidrug-resistant E. coli clinical isolates expressing different types of AMEs including common
aminoglycoside phosphotransferases. No cross-resistance was observed,
suggesting that the natural product is not part of the substrate range
of AMEs. To adapt the highly prevalent aminoglycoside phosphotransferases
for activity on corramycin would, among extensive mutations, also
require a specific C-terminal extension of these proteins. We are
of the opinion that such a process would likely be very slow, which,
in conjunction with its intriguing structure, the lack of cross-resistance
with commercially used antibiotics, and a most likely innovative target
renders corramycin a very promising antibiotic natural product primed
for further development. Since phosphorylation is a very effective way to
