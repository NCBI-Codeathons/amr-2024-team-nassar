 Recent advances in
sequencing techniques unveiled the vast potential
of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides
(RiPPs) encoded in microbiomes. Class I lantibiotics such as nisin
A, widely used as a food preservative, have been investigated for
their efficacy in killing pathogens. However, the impact of nisin
and nisin-like class I lantibiotics on commensal bacteria residing
in the human gut remains unclear. Here, we report six gut-derived
class I lantibiotics that are close homologues of nisin, four of which
are novel. We applied an improved lantibiotic expression platform
to produce and purify these lantibiotics for antimicrobial assays.
We determined their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against
both Gram-positive human pathogens and gut commensals and profiled
the lantibiotic resistance genes in these pathogens and commensals.
Structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies with analogs
revealed key regions and residues that impact their antimicrobial
properties. Our characterization and SAR studies of nisin-like lantibiotics
against both pathogens and human gut commensals could shed light on
the future development of lantibiotic-based therapeutics and food
preservatives. Introduction Introduction Bacteria have evolved in an intense competition
with other microbes
in complex environments. In order to make niche clearance or to establish
colonization resistance in the community, many bacteria produce bacteriocins
to kill microbial competitors.1 Bacteriocins
can function as natural food preservatives through the inhibition
of pathogenic bacteria, ultimately contributing to food safety.2 Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally
modified peptides (RiPPs) are a major class of bacteriocins that exhibit
a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria including Staphylococcus
aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli.3−5 The biosynthesis of RiPPs starts with a gene-encoded precursor peptide,
which comprises a C-terminal core peptide fused to an N-terminal leader
peptide.6 The leader peptide is recognized
by modification enzymes that are usually encoded in the same biosynthetic
gene cluster (BGC) to receive post-translational modifications on
the core peptide. Subsequently, the leader peptide is removed by protease
cleavage to yield the mature peptide with desired bioactivity.7,8 Bioinformatic studies have found great potential for RiPP discovery
from the microbiome.9 Recent advances in
metagenomic sequencing and assembly have made vast amounts of environmental
microbial genomes available for investigation. Mining algorithms of
BGCs with machine learning are also developed to accommodate rapidly
increasing metagenomic data sets.7,10 Lanthipeptides
are a very large family of RiPPs that are characterized by thioether
cross-links called lanthionine and methyllanthionine.11 The bioinformatic tool Rapid ORF Description & Evaluation

and “antibiotics”, are a class of RiPPs that have garnered
significant attention due to their potent antimicrobial properties
and wide application in the food industry. The thioether macrocycles
in class I lantibiotics are installed in a two-step process.11 LanB dehydrates Ser and Thr residues in the
LanA precursor peptides to generate dehydroalanine (Dha) and dehydrobutyrine
(Dhb), respectively. The dehydration is followed by LanC catalyzing
the intramolecular Michael-type addition of Cys residues to Dha or
Dhb, forming lanthionine or methyllanthionine. The catalytic activity
of LanB depends on glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) and tRNAGlu,14 and LanBs display sequence selectivity
toward the tRNAGlu acceptor stem.15 Previous studies have demonstrated that introducing GluRS and tRNAGlu from the native lanthipeptide-producing organism could
improve the production of fully modified peptides in E. coli.15,16 Using this information,
an improved production platform has been established for facile production
of class I lanthipeptides in E. coli.17 Lantibiotics, coined by combining “lanthipeptide”

by the gut commensal
bacteria Blautia producta SCSK (BPSCSK), exerts colonization resistance and clearance of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) in vivo.18 A
previous study showed that the in vivo VRE colonization in colon was
inhibited by BPSCSK but not by Lactococcus
lactis, the producing strain of the well-studied class
I lantibiotic nisin.18 In comparison to
nisin, blauticin has reduced activity against intestinal commensal
bacteria in vitro.18 Nisin binds lipid
II and inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis through its N-terminal
rings, and forms pores in the bacterial membrane that also involves
the C terminus of the peptide.19−21 These pores are made up of eight
nisin molecules and four lipid II molecules.22 Extensive efforts have been made to reveal the structure–activity
relationship (SAR) of nisin and its antimicrobial efficacy.23−25 However, the SAR of blauticin and its bioactivities against pathogens
and human gut commensals remain to be elucidated. Blauticin, a class I lantibiotic produced

of human gut commensals to nisin that is widely
present in food26 has been surprisingly
underexplored. Gram-positive human gut commensals, especially those
within the Lachnospiraceae family of Bacillota (previously Firmicutes),
are major producers of secondary metabolites such as short-chain fatty
acids and secondary bile acids, which are crucial in contributing
to the stability of the gut microbiome and host immune homeostasis.27 Orally ingested nisin A induced sizable but
reversible changes in microbial composition and metabolic activities
of the gut microbiome in pigs28 and in
mice.29 SAR studies of lantibiotics including
blauticin and their potencies on human gut commensals will guide the
future potential development of novel preservatives that could cause
less collateral damage to human microbial communities. Genetic screening
in pathogens and lantibiotic-producing organisms has identified multiple
mechanisms of resistance against lantibiotics. These include cell
wall modifications, cell membrane modifications, and efflux pumps,
among others.30 However, whether these
mechanisms exist in human gut commensals and how they may impact lantibiotic

we applied RODEO to the public RefSeq database to uncover
novel nisin-like class I lantibiotics encoded in gut microbial genomes.
After applying filtering criteria, six gut-derived class I lantibiotics
that are close homologues of nisin were discovered, four of which
were new. We applied the improved lantibiotic expression platform

from the Gut Mining of Class I Lantibiotics
from the Gut Mining of Class I Lantibiotics
from the Gut To find
novel class I lantibiotic sequences from the gut, we adopted a workflow
shown in Figure 1A.
We applied RODEO,12 an algorithm previously
used to identify lanthipeptide sequences in large numbers of genomes,13 to the RefSeq database. RODEO uses a hidden
Markov model to mine for RiPP BGCs and predict precursor peptides
by the combination of heuristic scoring and machine learning.12 We restricted our search to bacterial genomes
whose representatives were reported to be found in mammalian guts.
From this approach, we identified 41 unique lanthipeptide candidates
(Supporting Information). To find close
homologues of nisin and related lantibiotics, we filtered the results
based on the following criteria. First, we set a maximum on the peptide
length. Because both nisin A and blauticin have 57 residues, including
the leader peptide, any length significantly longer than that was
unlikely to yield nisin-like lantibiotics. Indeed, WP_117994378.1_29961,
a candidate with a length of 71, showed minimal sequence similarity
to nisin A (Figure S1). We therefore set
the maximum length as 72 residues. Second, the cysteine positions
in the peptide needed to align with the ring-forming Cys residues
in nisin A and blauticin based on a multiple sequence alignment (Figure S1). We further consolidated sequences
that differed only in leader sequences but were the same in the core
peptide. Six unique class I lantibiotic sequences, including two known
examples, blauticin from B. producta and nisin O from Blautia obeum,31 were identified (Figure 1B, Supporting Information). In fact, the blauticin precursor peptide was also found in Blautia coccoides and nisin O was also found within
a Faecalicatena contorta genome. The
sequences of four novel nisin-like class I lantibiotic candidates
were compared to the prototypical lantibiotics nisin A and blauticin,
as shown in Figure 1B. Lan-Df from Dorea formicigenerans was identified to be a close homologue of nisin O, with one amino
acid different from nisin O in ring A. Lan-CE02 from Clostridium sp. E02 further deviates from the prototype lantibiotics with unique
residues spanning across the peptide. We discovered two variants,
Lan-P49.1 and Lan-P49.2, from the same genome of Pseudobutyrivibrio sp. 49. Lan-P49.1 and Lan-P49.2 both share the same sequences as
blauticin in ring A and B at the N termini of the peptides, but the
C-termini of the peptides including the hinge region between rings
C and D are different from nisin A and blauticin. This hinge region
has been shown to be important for pore formation and antimicrobial
activity.32−35 To find

BpcA1–BpcA4 are four identical copies
of the blauticin precursor peptide and BpcA5 is a fifth
peptide, the function of which remains to be identified (Figure 2A).18 An initial attempt of coexpressing His6-tagged
BpcA1 with BpcB and BpcC in E. coli in the absence of the pEVOL plasmid resulted in a mixture of zero
to nine dehydrations with the 9-fold dehydrated peptide as one of
the least abundant products after leader peptide removal (Figures 2D and S3B). The poor dehydratase activity is likely
the result of sequence differences of the major recognition elements
for the lantibiotic dehydratases that are located on the acceptor
stem of tRNAGlu when comparing E. coli and B. producta sequences (Figure 2B). After incorporating
the pEVOL vector that encodes B. producta SCSK GluRS and tRNACUCGlu in the expression
system, up to nine dehydrations were observed by matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) after trypsin removal of the leader peptide. The mass distribution
of the product was similar as that of wild-type blauticin that was
isolated from the producing organism (Figures 2C,E and S4A,C).
Production of lantibiotics as a mixture of peptides with different
dehydration states in the native producing organism is not uncommon
and is for example also observed for the commercial food preservative
nisin36,37 (Figure S6J)
or a recently reported lanthipeptide from the human oral microbiome
that has pro-immune activity.38 We further
purified the blauticin mixture with RP-HPLC and collected its fully
dehydrated form (nine dehydrations; Figure S4A) and compared its antimicrobial activity to the dehydration mixture.
We observed a similar minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fully
dehydrated blauticin, mixed dehydrated blauticin, and native blauticin
against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium ATCC700221 (VRE) (Figure S4B). Among the five BPSCSK lantibiotic precursors that are

peptide, the function of which remains to be identified (Figure 2A).18 An initial attempt of coexpressing His6-tagged
BpcA1 with BpcB and BpcC in E. coli in the absence of the pEVOL plasmid resulted in a mixture of zero
to nine dehydrations with the 9-fold dehydrated peptide as one of
the least abundant products after leader peptide removal (Figures 2D and S3B). The poor dehydratase activity is likely
the result of sequence differences of the major recognition elements
for the lantibiotic dehydratases that are located on the acceptor
stem of tRNAGlu when comparing E. coli and B. producta sequences (Figure 2B). After incorporating
the pEVOL vector that encodes B. producta SCSK GluRS and tRNACUCGlu in the expression
system, up to nine dehydrations were observed by matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) after trypsin removal of the leader peptide. The mass distribution
of the product was similar as that of wild-type blauticin that was
isolated from the producing organism (Figures 2C,E and S4A,C).
Production of lantibiotics as a mixture of peptides with different
dehydration states in the native producing organism is not uncommon
and is for example also observed for the commercial food preservative
nisin36,37 (Figure S6J)
or a recently reported lanthipeptide from the human oral microbiome
that has pro-immune activity.38 We further
purified the blauticin mixture with RP-HPLC and collected its fully
dehydrated form (nine dehydrations; Figure S4A) and compared its antimicrobial activity to the dehydration mixture.
We observed a similar minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fully
dehydrated blauticin, mixed dehydrated blauticin, and native blauticin
against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium ATCC700221 (VRE) (Figure S4B). Figure 2Heterologous

the tRNA specificity of the lantibiotic

tRNAGlu from different organisms but to also discriminate
between tRNAGlu isoacceptors encoded in the genome of Microbispora sp. 107891. A tRNA scanning analysis of the B. producta SCSK genome revealed the presence of
two tRNAGlu genes encoding tRNACUCGlu and tRNAUUCGlu isoacceptors (Figure 2B).39,40 The presence of the two different tRNAGlu types prompted
an investigation into whether the dehydratase BpcB displayed isoacceptor
preference. We coexpressed each of the two isoacceptors in the pEVOL
vector with BpcA1, BpcB, and BpcC in E.

revealed that BpcA1 dehydration was similarly improved when either
tRNACUCGlu or tRNAUUCGlu was used as the isoacceptor, with tRNAUUCGlu perhaps yielding slightly more BpcA with less dehydration compared
to tRNACUCGlu (Figures 2E,F, and S3C,D). These data indicate that both tRNAGlu isoacceptors
from BPSCSK can be used by BpcB. A previous report studied

of Novel Class I Lantibiotics After successful demonstration
of the expression of blauticin in E. coli, we applied a similar approach to express
and isolate the novel nisin-like class I lantibiotics discovered in
the genomes of mammalian gut microbiota. Rather than using the precursor
peptide and biosynthetic enzymes encoded in the producing organisms,
we used the His-tagged blauticin leader sequence and fused to its
C-terminus the desired lanthipeptide core sequence. The pETDuet plasmid
encoding the chimeric substrate was coexpressed with plasmids encoding
BpcB, BpcC, and B. producta GluRS and
tRNAGlu. Such use of one set of producing enzymes for production
of structurally closely related analogs of a certain lantibiotic has
been successfully used previously.41 The
modified lantibiotic precursor peptides were purified and digested
with trypsin for leader peptide removal. Fully dehydrated Lan-CE02,
Lan-Df, Lan-P49.1, and Lan-P49.2 were observed by MALDI-TOF MS (Figure S5 and Table S1). Tandem electrospray
ionization (ESI) MS analyses were consistent with these compounds
all having the same ring pattern as that of nisin/blauticin (Figure S6). As has been pointed out before,42 the number of potential isomers with different
ring patterns for these types of peptides is very large (>6500)

cyclization was nonselective, and nonenzymatic cyclization does not
provide active nisin.43 Conversely, the

we set out to test the antimicrobial activities of these purified
lantibiotics against a panel of Gram-positive bacteria that are representatives
of some of the most prevalent human pathogens: VRE, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus USA300 (MRSA), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis SK135 (MRSE), Listeria monocytogenes 10403S, and Clostridioides difficile VPI10463. We examined the
growth of bacteria in a 96-well plate under a concentration gradient
of lantibiotics under anaerobic conditions (Figure S2B). In general, nisin A and Lan-Df had the strongest inhibitory
activities against pathogens based on their MIC, followed by nisin
O. Blauticin, Lan-CE02, and Lan-P49.2 had intermediate activities,
while Lan-P49.1 had the weakest activity (Figure 3A–E). Comparing across the pathogen

to commensal
bacteria in the human microbiome, leading to dysbiosis and susceptibility
to various diseases.44 How lantibiotics
impact Gram-positive commensals from the human gut has remained unclear.
Therefore, we performed antimicrobial activity tests of these lantibiotics
against selected Gram-positive human gut commensals, most of which
belong to the Lachnospiraceae family, one of the most abundant bacterial
families in the human gut.27 In general,
human gut commensals were more susceptible to the set of investigated
lantibiotics compared to pathogens (Figure 3). The activities of the lantibiotics tested
generally followed the trend of those against Gram-positive pathogens;
while nisin A and Lan-Df were generally more effective in growth inhibition,
Lan-P49.1, Lan-P49.2, and Lan-CE02 had weaker antimicrobial activities
(Figure 3F–M).
Among all, Erysipeloclostridium ramosum MSK.23.96 displayed the highest resistance to lantibiotics compared
to other commensals tested. Interestingly, Coprococcus
comes MSK.11.23 had an opposite sensitivity profile;
it was relatively resistant to nisin A, nisin O, and Lan-Df, while

investigate the mechanisms of action of these nisin-like
lantibiotics, we performed liposome permeabilization assays using
liposomes with or without lipid II (Figure S7). We observed that the fraction of liposomes containing lipid II
that were permeabilized upon incubation with lantibiotics largely
correlated with their MIC values against bacteria: nisin O, Lan-Df,
and Lan-P49.2, as well as blauticin and nisin A, strongly induced
permeabilization of lipid II-containing liposomes, while Lan-CE02
and Lan-P49.1 were not as effective (Figure S7B). We further tested the most active lantibiotics for their permeabilization
activities on liposomes without lipid II. Nisin O, Lan-Df, and Lan-P49.2,
as well as blauticin and nisin A, had decreased permeabilization activities
on liposomes without lipid II compared to liposomes with lipid II
(Figure S7). These findings suggest that
the mechanism of action of these nisin-like lantibiotics is mainly
lipid II-dependent membrane permeabilization, but they also disrupt
membranes less potently in the absence of lipid II in a nonspecific
mechanism. Unexpectedly, blauticin in the mixed dehydration state
had decreased permeabilization activity compared to fully dehydrated
blauticin (Figure S7B), even though the
MIC values against VRE were similar (Figure S4B). To further

the mechanism of action of these nisin-like lantibiotics is mainly
lipid II-dependent membrane permeabilization, but they also disrupt
membranes less potently in the absence of lipid II in a nonspecific
mechanism. Unexpectedly, blauticin in the mixed dehydration state
had decreased permeabilization activity compared to fully dehydrated
blauticin (Figure S7B), even though the
MIC values against VRE were similar (Figure S4B). Lantibiotic Resistance Genes in Pathogens and Commensals Lantibiotic Resistance Genes in Pathogens and Commensals Lantibiotic Resistance Genes in Pathogens and Commensals The differences in lantibiotic susceptibility profiles of pathogens
and human gut commensals led to further investigation of potential
lantibiotic resistance mechanisms encoded in the genomes of gut bacteria.
Many mechanisms of lantibiotic resistance in bacteria have been reported,
mostly revealed through genetic screening of pathogens. One major
resistance mechanism is bacterial cell wall modifications. The dltABCD operon is responsible for the d-alanylation
of lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and wall teichoic acids (WTA), resulting
in an increase of positive charges in the cell wall and the repulsion
of cationic lantibiotics.45,46 Another major resistance
mechanism is efflux pumps. The LanFEG three-component transporter
and homologues can expel lantibiotics,30,47,48 while the BceAB two-component transporter, originally
reported as a bacitracin efflux pump, also provides cross-protection
against lantibiotics.49 Other resistance
mechanisms include the tellurite resistance gene telA,50 cell membrane modifications by mprF,51 the nisin resistance
protein NSR,52,53 and lantibiotic self-resistance
proteins LanI.54 Of these, LanFEG and LanI
are often found in lantibiotic BGCs. The differences in lantibiotic susceptibility profiles of pathogens
and human gut commensals led to further investigation of potential
lantibiotic resistance mechanisms encoded in the genomes of gut bacteria.

Model and BLAST search for the aforementioned genes among the genomes
of pathogens and human gut commensals tested. For resistance mechanisms
that require multiple genes (dltABCD, bceAB, and lanFEG), only the complete presence as an
operon was counted. The numbers of corresponding genes in each genome
are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Bacteria are listed in ascending order
from left to right according to the median MIC value across the nisin-like
lantibiotic panel. We found that for most organisms, the numbers of
potential resistance-inducing genes present in a specific genome did
not correlate with stronger lantibiotic resistance (lower susceptibility). becAB and mprF may correlate with resistance
in some cases, as the most sensitive Clostridioides
difficile does not possess these genes. Among human
gut commensals, the most resistant E. ramosum has more bceAB genes than others. However, one
of the most sensitive strains, Anaerostipes hadrus MSK.14.23, also contains the bceAB genes. In conclusion,
the numbers of putative resistance genes in these pathogens and commensals
cannot fully explain their relative susceptibility to the lantibiotics

the high similarity of sequences among the nisin-like lantibiotics
encoded in the gut microbiome, we next set out to study the structure–activity
relationships (SAR) between specific residues and the antimicrobial
activity. Blauticin and nisin O are two lantibiotics derived from Blautia species, but their activities vary against both
pathogens and commensals, with nisin O being more effective in most
cases. Four major regions differ between them: residues 1 and 2 at
their N termini, residue 12 between rings B and C, residues 20–22
at the hinge region, and residue 29 at the C termini (Figure 4A). To assess the impact of
these individual regions on the antimicrobial activity, we synthesized
four blauticin analogs by replacing the blauticin residues with the
corresponding residues in nisin O (analog1–analog4) using the
expression platform described above (Figures 4A and S8, and Table S1). Given

the four analogs were tested against the aforementioned
panel of pathogens and gut commensals. In the pathogen panel, analog1
had intermediate antimicrobial activity between blauticin and nisin
O, except in the case against VRE (Figure 4B–F), while analog2 to analog4 displayed
comparable or reduced activities compared to the two parent lantibiotics.
On the other hand, for the gut commensal panel, analog1 and analog3
had intermediate inhibitory activities between blauticin and nisin
O for some commensals (Figure 4G–I,L), and had even better antimicrobial activities
when targeting E. ramosum (Figure 4J) or D. formicigenerans (Figure 4K). On the contrary, analogs2 and 4 exhibited
diminished activities compared to both parent molecules (Figure 4G–N). Interestingly,
for C. eutactus, none of the analogs
displayed better inhibition than either parent lantibiotic, and it
was also the only case when blauticin had a lower MIC than nisin O.
These data suggest that the first two residues and the hinge region
of nisin-like lantibiotics have a more direct impact on the antimicrobial
activity of nisin-like lantibiotics, while single-residue mutations
V12P and Q29H had a deleterious impact on antimicrobial activity depending

on two highly similar lantibiotics,
Lan-P49.1 and Lan-P49.2. They originate from the same Pseudobutyrivibrio genome, and their amino acid sequences have the largest difference
in the hinge region. To test the impact of the hinge region, we swapped
the hinge region of Lan-P49.1 into the Lan-P49.2 backbone, creating
analog5 (Figures 5A
and S8, and Table S1). Analog5 had decreased
antimicrobial activity against the pathogen panel compared with Lan-P49.2
(Figure 5B–F).
When tested against the gut commensal panel, analog5 displayed intermediate
activity compared to Lan-P49.1 and Lan-P49.2 in most cases (Figure 5H,I,K,M,N), reaching
the same MIC as that of Lan-P49.1 in some bacteria (Figure 5M) and the same MIC as that
of Lan-P49.2 in other commensals (Figure 5H,I,N). Interestingly, for A. hadrus and C. comes, analog5 had decreased antimicrobial activity compared to both parent
lantibiotics, whereas for E. ramosum, analog5 had increased antimicrobial activity. These data demonstrate
the importance of the hinge region in determining the antimicrobial
activity of nisin-like lantibiotics, and are consistent with an emerging
realization that lantibiotics may act differently based on the target
organism investigated.55 We further performed SAR studies

widely used in the
food industry for decades and has been explored as an antimicrobial
therapeutic.23,26 Nisin A is produced by L. lactis, found in milk. However, how nisin and
nisin-like lantibiotics might impact the human gut microbiome has
not been elucidated, nor has the presence of nisin-like compounds
in the human gut microbiome been investigated in detail. The recent
discovery of blauticin and nisin analogs clearly indicates that nisin-like
molecules are encoded in the human microbiome,18,31,56,57 with other
analogs detected in the microbiome of other mammals.58,59 To first explore the biosynthetic potential of the gut microbiome
for lantibiotic production, we systematically performed bioinformatic
mining with RODEO for nisin-like lantibiotics derived from gut bacterial
genomes. Subsequent filtering, multiple sequence alignment, and manual
curation discovered six gut-derived nisin-like lantibiotics, four
of which were not reported previously. Our work greatly expands the
repertoire of naturally encoded nisin-like lantibiotics from the human
gut. Nisin is a class I lantibiotic that has been

repertoire of naturally encoded nisin-like lantibiotics from the human
gut. Utilizing an improved heterologous expression platform
for lantibiotics
in E. coli, we produced all six gut-derived
lantibiotics in mixed dehydration states. Blauticin is produced in
very similar mixed dehydration states by its native host B. producta, and its fully dehydrated form has a
similar efficacy against VRE compared to its mixture of different
dehydration states. This finding, along with the observation that
nisin is also produced in various dehydration states in its native
producer (e.g., see Figure S6J for commercial
nisin A),36,37 suggests that nisin-like lantibiotics do
not require full dehydration for their antimicrobial activity. Therefore,
we used purified lantibiotics in mixed dehydration states in this
study because they best represent the naturally produced compounds.
Despite similar MIC values, blauticin in mixed dehydration states
displayed decreased lipid II-containing liposome permeabilization
activity compared with fully dehydrated blauticin. One possible explanation
for this finding is that blauticin binding to lipid II without pore
formation (e.g., lipid II sequestration60) may contribute to killing bacteria. Utilizing an improved heterologous expression platform

and human gut commensals have varied susceptibility
profiles toward the panel of lantibiotics tested. Many mechanisms
of lantibiotic resistance have been described in bacteria; besides
mechanisms already discussed, an array of two-component systems and
cell membrane modification genes have also been reported to confer
lantibiotic resistance (see detailed discussion in ref (30)). Besides the presence
and number of resistance genes in the genome, the regulation and expression
of these genes are also important in lantibiotic resistance. While
we did not find strong correlations between the numbers of resistance
genes and the MICs of the lantibiotic panel tested, future studies
of expression and regulation of various resistance genes in bacteria,
especially in human gut commensals, will be needed to elucidate the
apparent differences in susceptibility among Gram-positive bacteria.
Alternatively, other differences between the tested bacteria, such
as membrane composition, may account for the different susceptibilities. Gram-positive pathogens

Alternatively, other differences between the tested bacteria, such

naturally occurring nisin-like lantibiotics to their antimicrobial
activity, we studied the SAR of two pairs of closely related lantibiotics:
blauticin versus nisin O, and Lan-P49.1 versus Lan-P49.2. Both SARs
revealed that the hinge region is critical in determining the efficacy
of these lantibiotics, consistent with previous reports.32−35,61 SAR studies of blauticin versus
nisin O also found the first two residues to be important for activity.
Surprisingly, when residues in blauticin were changed to their counterparts
in nisin O (analog2 and analog4), it caused deleterious effects on
the antimicrobial activity even against bacteria toward which nisin
O has stronger activity than blauticin. Our data suggest that the
impact of certain individual residues is context-dependent, implicating
intricate interactions among residues along the full length of nisin-like
lantibiotics. The 1:1 structure of nisin bound to lipid II has been
determined by NMR spectroscopy in DMSO,62 and solid-state NMR studies of the lipid II-nisin complex in a membrane
environment show that the hinge region is facing the lumen of the
pore in the complex.63 However, the details
of the structure of the 2:1 nisin to lipid II complex that is believed
to be present in the pores that are made up of eight nisin and four
lipid II molecules34 is currently still
not known. Our results showing high sensitivity to replacing even
single residues suggest that it may be that the naturally occurring
sequences of nisin-like lantibiotics may have evolved such that covariance
of residues is important for forming the 2:1 ratio structure and/or
that the residues facing the lumen of the pore in the complex are
important for bioactivity. To further understand the contribution of specific residues in

through bioinformatic mining, produced them using an improved heterologous
expression platform, and studied their antimicrobial activities against
both pathogens and human gut commensals. These characterizations and

both pathogens and human gut commensals, providing insights that will
be valuable for the future development of lantibiotic-based therapeutics
