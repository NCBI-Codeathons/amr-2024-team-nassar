ABSTRACT Colibactins are hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides produced by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae harboring the pks genomic island. These genotoxic metabolites are produced by pks-encoded peptide-polyketide synthases as inactive prodrugs called precolibactins, which are then converted to colibactins by deacylation for DNA-damaging effects. Colibactins are bona fide virulence factors and are suspected of promoting colorectal carcinogenesis when produced by intestinal E. coli. Natural active colibactins have not been isolated, and how they induce DNA damage in the eukaryotic host cell is poorly characterized. Here, we show that DNA strands are cross-linked covalently when exposed to enterobacteria producing colibactins. DNA cross-linking is abrogated in a clbP mutant unable to deacetylate precolibactins or by adding the colibactin self-resistance protein ClbS, confirming the involvement of the mature forms of colibactins. A similar DNA-damaging mechanism is observed in cellulo, where interstrand cross-links are detected in the genomic DNA of cultured human cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. The intoxicated cells exhibit replication stress, activation of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), and recruitment of the DNA cross-link repair Fanconi anemia protein D2 (FANCD2) protein. In contrast, inhibition of ATR or knockdown of FANCD2 reduces the survival of cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. These findings demonstrate that DNA interstrand cross-linking is the critical mechanism of colibactin-induced DNA damage in infected cells. IMPORTANCE Colorectal cancer is the third-most-common cause of cancer death. In addition to known risk factors such as high-fat diets and alcohol consumption, genotoxic intestinal Escherichia coli bacteria producing colibactin are proposed to play a role in colon cancer development. Here, by using transient infections with genotoxic E. coli, we showed that colibactins directly generate DNA cross-links in cellulo. Such lesions are converted into double-strand breaks during the repair response. DNA cross-links, akin to those induced by metabolites of alcohol and high-fat diets and by widely used anticancer drugs, are both severely mutagenic and profoundly cytotoxic lesions. This finding of a direct induction of DNA cross-links by a bacterium should facilitate delineating the role of E. coli in colon cancer and engineering new anticancer agents. KEYWORDS INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Colibactins are genotoxic natural products of unknown structure produced by human commensal and extraintestinal pathogenic strains of Enterobacteriaceae and by other bacteria associated with different host organisms. Biosynthesis of colibactins is allowed by a highly conserved 54-kb genomic “pks” island found in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter koseri (1, 2). The colibactin synthesis pathway is also found in marine Pseudovibrio spp. associated with sponges, in the honey bee gut symbiont Frischella perrara, and in Erwinia oleae isolated from olive tree knots (3–5). Colibactin production has been linked to pathogenicity and cancer. Indeed, the pks island is associated with a highly virulent subset of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli isolates and with hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains (6–8). The contribution of colibactins to the virulence of E. coli and K. pneumoniae has been demonstrated in rodent sepsis and meningitis models, where isogenic mutants impaired for colibactin production exhibit attenuated virulence compared to wild-type pks-positive (pks+) strains (9–11). The presence of the pks island also correlates with the ability of E. coli strains belonging to phylogenetic group B2 to establish persistent colonization of the host intestine (12).

E. coli promotes colon tumor formation in mouse models of chronic intestinal inflammation, supporting the idea of a role for these bacteria in the development of colorectal cancer (13, 16, 17). The pks island hosts 19 genes (clbA to clbS), and mutation of any of these genes, except clbS, results in a decrease in or loss of the genotoxic activity (1). The pks island codes for multienzymatic biosynthesis machinery, with nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs), an efflux pump, and “accessory” enzymes. The NRPSs and PKSs are modified posttranslationally for acceptance of synthesis building blocks by the ClbA phosphopantetheinyl transferase (18, 19). The NRPSs and PKSs then function as a multimodular assembly line that synthesizes the inactive precolibactins. Precolibactin biosynthetic intermediates are offloaded from the assembly line by the ClbQ thioesterase, thus possibly regulating colibactin synthesis and genotoxic activity (20, 21). Precolibactins then follow a prodrug pathway, where the products are transported to the bacterial periplasm by the ClbM pump (22). Precolibactins are cleaved by the periplasmic peptidase ClbP to remove an N-terminal precursor scaffold (myristoyl-asparagine) and generate active colibactins (23–25). This prodrug export and activation pathway likely represents a self-protection mechanism preventing self-toxicity to the producing bacteria. As a supplemental self-protection mechanism, the pks island encodes the ClbS resistance protein, a cyclopropane hydrolase that inactivates colibactins in the producing bacterium (26, 27). This protection is also observed in cultured human cells transfected with the clbS gene (26).

HeLa cell DNA damage was then quantified by examining the phosphorylation of histone H2AX on S139 (p-H2AX), a sensitive and quantitative reporter of DNA damage (34) (Fig. 1a).

To confirm the occurrence of ICLs in the extracellular DNA exposed to pks+
E. coli, we used an ethidium fluorescence assay to examine the recovery of fluorescence following denaturation and rapid cooling. In this assay, separate DNA strands do not reanneal, whereas ICL-connected strands renature rapidly, as ICLs serve as a nucleation points for rapid renaturation (35) (Fig. 2d).

E. coli required a close interaction with live bacteria; no ICLs were observed in the DNA treated with bacterial culture supernatants or in the DNA separated from the DH10B pBACpks bacteria by a membrane with 0.2-μm pores (Fig. S2). The genotoxicity and interstrand cross-linking phenotypes were fully correlated in different pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae strains harboring the pks island; clinical strains of E. coli, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes induced both p-H2AX in infected HeLa cells and ICL in extracellular DNA (Fig. S3). To further establish the role of colibactins in the induction of extracellular DNA ICL, we assessed isogenic mutants of pks island genes that impair various steps of the colibactin synthesis pathway. Mutation of the clbA gene encoding the phosphopantetheinyl transferase that activates the NRPS and PKS enzymes resulted in a complete loss of extracellular DNA interstrand cross-linking activity and genotoxicity in infected HeLa cells (Fig. 3a). A clbH mutant impaired for the NRPS that incorporates the electrophile cyclopropane in colibactin (32, 37) also exhibited a complete loss of both phenotypes (Fig. 3a). Mutation of clbQ encoding the thioesterase that off-loads synthesis intermediates from the NRPS-PKS enzymatic assembly line abrogated both phenotypes (Fig. 3a). Finally, a clbP mutant defective for the peptidase that deacetylates precolibactins to generate the mature active colibactins completely lost the cross-linking activity and genotoxicity for HeLa cells (Fig. 3a). Both the genotoxicity and cross-linking phenotypes were fully restored by complementation of all mutants with their cognate wild-type clb genes (Fig. 3a).

To accumulate additional evidence to establish the role of colibactins in the induction of DNA ICL, we tested whether the colibactin resistance protein could protect DNA from the genotoxin. Indeed, colibactin-producing bacteria protect themselves from their own mature active genotoxin by producing the ClbS hydrolase, which inactivates colibactins (26, 27). We thus reasoned that adding the purified ClbS protein into the supernatant should inhibit colibactin-induced DNA ICL. DNA was exposed to E. coli DH10B pBACpks or to the E. coli SP15, C. koseri, and K. pneumoniae clinical isolates in the presence or absence of 400 nM purified His-tagged ClbS protein. The DNA did not exhibit ICL (or the levels were barely detectable), indicating that it was readily protected by ClbS (Fig. 3b; see also Fig. S4). In contrast, the heat-denatured ClbS protein did not protect the DNA exposed to the pks+ bacteria (Fig. 3b; see also Fig. S4). ClbS did not inhibit DNA cross-linking by cisplatin, confirming its specificity for colibactins (Fig. S4). HeLa cells infected with DH10B pBACpks in the presence of purified ClbS exhibited markedly reduced levels of p-H2AX compared to cells infected in the presence of heat-denatured ClbS or without ClbS (Fig. 3c and d), confirming that ClbS inhibits the genotoxin activity.

Infection of HeLa cells with colibactin-producing E. coli induces an ATR-dependent replication stress response. Infection of HeLa cells with colibactin-producing E. coli induces an ATR-dependent replication stress response. We next asked whether colibactins could induce DNA ICL in human cells. We previously showed that colibactin-dependent genomic injuries induce the host DNA damage response through increases of levels of p-H2AX and activation of ATM by phosphorylation on S1981 (1). ATM activation depends on the presence of DSBs, which are DNA lesions that can be generated during replication-dependent ICL repair (38). Before DSB formation, ICLs first block progression of replication forks (by preventing replicative helicase-dependent double-strand DNA unwinding), resulting in the activation of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) by autophosphorylation at T1989. Activated ATR then coordinates the cellular response to the replication stress and ICL removal (39). We thus monitored ATR and ATM activation in HeLa cells collected 8 h after infection with DH10B hosting the BACpks or the vector or after treatment with mitomycin C (MMC). Western blot analyses showed that both ATM and ATR were phosphorylated following infection with pks+

E. coli, we next examined two targets of the ATR kinase activity, Chk1 and replication protein A-32 (RPA), for phosphorylation at S345 and S33, respectively (40, 41). As seen with cisplatin, but in contrast to the results seen with bacteria hosting the vector, infection with DH10B pBACpks induced the phosphorylation of Chk1 and RPA. Inactivating ATR by the use of its specific inhibitor VE-821 (ATRi) (41) prevented this response (Fig. 4b; see also Fig. S5). We observed a loss of histone H3 phosphorylation (a hallmark of chromosome condensation) and of mitotic cells (Fig. S6) following infection with DH10B pBACpks that was consistent with cell cycle arrest (1). Treatment with ATRi alleviated this response, allowing pks+
E. coli-infected cells to enter mitosis with damaged DNA, evidenced by p-H2AX staining (Fig. S6). These mitotic cells never reached anaphase, strongly suggesting the presence of a chromosome segregation defect that ultimately leads to cell death by mitotic catastrophe (42). Hence, ATRi impaired cell viability upon treatment with cisplatin or infection with pks+ bacteria but not infection with bacteria lacking pks (Fig. 4c). Together, these results showed that infection of human cells with colibactin-producing bacteria elicits an ATR-dependent replication stress response, similar to that promoted by ICL-inducing agents, resulting in cell cycle arrest to prevent mitosis entry with damaged chromosomes and, ultimately, mitotic catastrophe.

HeLa cells infected with colibactin-producing E. coli exhibit recruitment of the Fanconi anemia repair pathway. HeLa cells infected with colibactin-producing E. coli exhibit recruitment of the Fanconi anemia repair pathway. In mammalian cells, the Fanconi anemia pathway is central to the repair of DNA ICL. Upon blockage of replication fork progression by DNA ICLs, Fanconi anemia protein D2 (FANCD2) is activated by monoubiquitinylation and is recruited to stalled forks, where it colocalizes in subnuclear foci with p-H2AX and orchestrates ICL removal (43–46). We thus examined whether HeLa cells infected with pks+
E. coli recapitulated these responses. As visualized by Western blotting, DH10B pBACpks-infected and MMC-treated cells exhibited the heaviest form of FANCD2 corresponding to the monoubiquitinylated protein, whereas DH10B pBAC vector-infected cells exhibited mostly the unmodified form of FANCD2 (Fig. 5a). Next, FANCD2 and p-H2AX focus formation was examined by fluorescence microscopy in HeLa cells infected with DH10B pBACpks or vector or treated with MMC. Four hours after exposure to DH10B vector, the cells presented some detectable p-H2AX and FANCD2 foci, reflecting the S-phase cells, as some FANCD2 foci form spontaneously during unperturbed replication (45) (Fig. 5b). In contrast, cells infected with DH10B pBACpks exhibited distinctive nuclear foci of FANCD2 colocalized with p-H2AX, similarly to the results observed in MMC-treated cells (Fig. 5b; see also Fig. S7). The percentage of cells harboring p-H2AX and FANCD2 foci increased markedly between 4 and 20 h after infection with DH10B pBACpks or treatment with MMC (Fig. 5c; see also Fig. S7). These comparable time-dependent responses strongly suggest that, similarly to the results seen with MMC-induced replication stress, DH10B pBACpks-infected cells entering the S phase encountered ICLs that activated the Fanconi pathway. We confirmed these observations by assessing the recruitment to DH10B pBACpks-induced repair foci of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and RPA, two well-established markers of DNA DSBs and blocked replication forks, respectively. In the same way as was seen with p-H2AX/FANCD2 foci, 53BP1 and RPA colocalized in subnuclear foci in a time-dependent manner in MMC-treated or pks+

Next, FANCD2 and p-H2AX focus formation was examined by fluorescence microscopy in HeLa cells infected with DH10B pBACpks or vector or treated with MMC. Four hours after exposure to DH10B vector, the cells presented some detectable p-H2AX and FANCD2 foci, reflecting the S-phase cells, as some FANCD2 foci form spontaneously during unperturbed replication (45) (Fig. 5b). In contrast, cells infected with DH10B pBACpks exhibited distinctive nuclear foci of FANCD2 colocalized with p-H2AX, similarly to the results observed in MMC-treated cells (Fig. 5b; see also Fig. S7). The percentage of cells harboring p-H2AX and FANCD2 foci increased markedly between 4 and 20 h after infection with DH10B pBACpks or treatment with MMC (Fig. 5c; see also Fig. S7). These comparable time-dependent responses strongly suggest that, similarly to the results seen with MMC-induced replication stress, DH10B pBACpks-infected cells entering the S phase encountered ICLs that activated the Fanconi pathway. We confirmed these observations by assessing the recruitment to DH10B pBACpks-induced repair foci of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and RPA, two well-established markers of DNA DSBs and blocked replication forks, respectively. In the same way as was seen with p-H2AX/FANCD2 foci, 53BP1 and RPA colocalized in subnuclear foci in a time-dependent manner in MMC-treated or pks+

E. coli-infected cells abrogated FANCD2 monoubiquitinylation and focus formation (Fig. S9). Thus, colibactins induce the replication stress response and recruitment of the Fanconi anemia pathway. In mammalian cells, the Fanconi anemia pathway is central to the repair of DNA ICL. Upon blockage of replication fork progression by DNA ICLs, Fanconi anemia protein D2 (FANCD2) is activated by monoubiquitinylation and is recruited to stalled forks, where it colocalizes in subnuclear foci with p-H2AX and orchestrates ICL removal (43–46). We thus examined whether HeLa cells infected with pks+

The recruitment of FANCD2 upon infection with pks+
E. coli argues for a role of the Fanconi anemia pathway in the management of ICLs induced by colibactin. Thus, we next asked whether inhibition of ICL repair results in hypersensitivity of the cells to colibactin. To test this hypothesis, FANCD2 expression was knocked down in HeLa cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Fig. S10a), the cells were infected with DH10 pBACpks or vector, and cell survival was assessed in a clonogenic assay. FANCD2-depleted cells formed significantly fewer colonies than HeLa cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA 7 days after infection with DH10B pBACpks but not after infection with DH10B pBAC vector (Fig. 5d; see also Fig. S10b). Thus, loss of ICL repair sensitizes HeLa cells to colibactin-producing E. coli. Together, these data demonstrate that in human cells, the Fanconi pathway machinery that is central to ICL repair is recruited following colibactin-induced DNA damage and is required for survival of infection with colibactin-producing bacteria.

To examine directly the occurrence of DNA ICLs in human cells exposed to pks+ enterobacteria, we inspected the cell genomic DNA by denaturing gel electrophoresis. HeLa cells were infected for 4 h with DH10B hosting pBACpks or with empty vector. As controls, cells were treated for 4 h with MMS, MMC, or cisplatin. HeLa cell genomic DNA was extracted immediately at the end of the infection period and analyzed on denaturing agarose gels (Fig. 6a). As expected, the genomic DNA of untreated cells migrated in the electrophoretic gel as an intact band with a high apparent molecular weight. In contrast, because ICLs prevent the denaturation of DNA and therefore inhibit its electrophoretic migration (47), a significant fraction of the genomic DNA of the cells treated with an ICL-inducing agent (cisplatin or MMC), but not of those treated with the monofunctional alkylating agent MMS, did not enter the gel and remained in the loading well (Fig. 6a and b). Similarly, the genomic DNA of cells infected with DH10B pBACpks exhibited a significant fraction of cross-linked DNA that did not migrate (Fig. 6a and b). This result indicated that DNA cross-links are rapidly generated by colibactin in infected HeLa cells. The addition of purified ClbS protein during the infection reduced the fraction of nonmigrating DNA in cells infected with pks+ bacteria to background levels but not in cisplatin-treated cells, thus confirming the involvement of the natural mature colibactin (Fig. 6c and d). Together with the replication stress and recruitment of the Fanconi anemia ICL repair pathway in pks-infected cells, these results demonstrate that the natural colibactin genotoxin generates DNA ICL in infected human cells.

DISCUSSION DISCUSSION In this study, we addressed the issue of the mode of action on DNA and resulting genotoxicity in the host cell of the natural colibactins produced by pks+ enterobacteria. As natural active colibactins resist isolation, we used live bacteria with an intact colibactin synthesis pathway, under culture conditions that allowed production of the genotoxic metabolites as demonstrated by the genotoxicity for the infected epithelial cells. In summary, we observed that addition of exogenous bacterial or mammalian DNA during the infection of epithelial cells by pks+
E. coli protected the cells from colibactin genotoxicity. The DNA directly exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria did not exhibit strand breaks but did exhibit cross-linking of the DNA strands. The in vitro cross-linking activity of pks+
E. coli was also observed on naked DNA in the absence of epithelial cells. This DNA cross-linking was similar to that induced by MMC and cisplatin (a natural cytotoxin and a synthetic antineoplastic drug, respectively), which are bifunctional DNA alkylators generating ICLs. All pks+ enterobacterial species (including clinical E. coli, C. koseri, and K. pneumoniae isolates) exerted the same phenotype. Mutagenesis of genes inactivating (pre)colibactin synthesis or inactivating the deacylation step that maturates precolibactins into genotoxic colibactins resulted in a complete loss of the cross-linking activity. These in vitro results strongly argue for a direct interaction of the natural colibactins with double-stranded DNA and for covalent cross-linking of the two complementary strands, resulting in DNA ICLs. Such a mode of action is in good agreement with the structural features that were recently predicted or identified in candidate nongenotoxic precolibactins: a thiazoline-thiazole tail and a spirocyclic cyclopropane ring (48, 49). Thiazole rings have been shown to allow DNA intercalation of DNA-targeting natural products such as the bleomycins, thus supporting the idea of a direct interaction of colibactins with DNA. Cyclopropane “warheads” are found in potent DNA-damaging natural products such as illudins, CC-1065, yatakemycin, and duocarmycins, which alkylate DNA through nucleophilic cyclopropane ring openings. An isolated candidate precolibactin (purified from a nongenotoxic clbP mutant) bearing the cyclopropane showed weak cross-linking activity when added in millimolar amounts to plasmid DNA and incubated for 20 h (32). In addition, synthetic compounds bearing a cyclopropane ring system similar to that detected in precolibactin candidates from clbP mutants were recently shown to alkylate plasmid DNA, resulting in extensive DNA cleavage (but not cross-linking) (33). The NRPS ClbH incorporates the cyclopropane during synthesis of (pre)colibactins, and we observed that clbH gene inactivation fully abrogated the DNA damage in infected cells and the cross-linking of plasmid DNA in vitro. In addition, both the DNA cross-linking and genotoxicity of pks+
E. coli were inhibited by addition of purified self-resistance protein ClbS, which was recently shown to convert the cyclopropane into inactive products by hydrolysis (27). Altogether, these data support a model where the natural colibactins directly damage double-stranded DNA, with a key role for the electrophilic cyclopropane in the alkylation of one DNA strand, formation of a second electrophilic site, and alkylation of the cDNA strand, resulting in an ICL.

Denaturing gel electrophoresis of DNA from epithelial cells infected with pks+
E. coli indicated that ICLs are rapidly (as soon as the end of the 4-h infection) generated within host cell genomic DNA. Thus, colibactins produced by pks+
E. coli not only directly damage and cross-link naked DNA in vitro but also can traffic in the infected epithelial cell, reach the nucleus, and cross-link DNA that is packaged into chromatin. DNA ICLs are recognized by the cellular DNA damage response mainly during DNA replication, halting the replication machinery and generating patches of single-stranded DNA (50, 51). ATR is activated in response to this replication stress signaled by the patches of single-stranded DNA directly bound by RPA (39). A previously published observation that pks+
E. coli-exposed cells lagged 48 h in the S phase before accumulating in the G2 phase whereas control cells proceeded through S-G2-M phases in 12 h (1) is consistent with the occurrence of replication stress. The recruitment of RPA in subnuclear foci and the activation/phosphorylation of ATR and its downstream substrate CHK1 also indicate the induction of replication stress in cells exposed to pks+
E. coli. Moreover, ATR activation was central in orchestrating the cellular response to colibactin-induced damage, since its pharmacological inhibition abrogated the DNA damage response and resulted in mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Activated ATR allowed the recruitment of the Fanconi anemia DNA cross-link repair pathway, evidenced by the activation of FANCD2 and its recruitment in subnuclear foci together with p-H2AX. As for ATR, FANCD2 was required for cell survival of colibactin-induced damage, as shown by the decreased level clonogeny upon FANCD2 depletion. Thus, induction of early genomic DNA ICLs by colibactins resulted in replication stress and activation of the ATR and Fanconi anemia repair pathways. Concurrently, DNA DSBs were formed, evidenced by ATM phosphorylation and the recruitment of p-H2AX and 53BP1 in subnuclear repair foci. Colibactin-induced ICLs are thus converted into DNA DSBs during the repair process, when DNA lesions are excised by the host repair nucleases (52, 53). Additionally, extended replication stalling and fork collapse can result in aberrant DNA structures and DSBs (54). The DNA-colibactin adducts might also degrade, as observed in vitro with synthetic colibactins mimics (33), or under oxidative conditions, colibactins could form reactive peroxides, leading to further DNA damage (27). We also cannot exclude the possibility that other types of DNA insults might be inflicted by different forms of colibactins, leading to DSBs by distinct mechanisms.

In conclusion, to our knowledge, this represents the first report of a direct induction of DNA ICLs in the mammalian genome by a bacterial infection. Such lesions induce replication stress and favor DSBs, and it has been shown that their accumulation over time contributes to aging in tissue and to genomic instability, a hallmark of precancerous cells. ICL is also an extremely lethal form of DNA damage, as it poses an unsurpassable block to replication and suppresses other fundamental DNA processes such as transcription and maintenance. Thus, these findings delineate a role of colibactins in tumorigenesis that might be more complex than previously thought.
