Myxobacteria feature unique biological characteristics, including their capability to glide on the surface, undergo different multicellular developmental stages and produce structurally unique natural products such as the catecholate-type siderophores myxochelins A and B. Herein, we report the isolation, structure elucidation and a proposed biosynthesis of the new congener myxochelin B-succinate from the terrestrial myxobacterial strain MSr12020, featuring a succinyl decoration at its primary amine group. Myxochelin-B-succinate exhibited antibacterial growth inhibition and moderate cytotoxic activity against selected human cancer cell lines. This unique chemical modification of myxochelin B might provide interesting insights for future microbiological studies to understand the biological function and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite succinylation. 1. Introduction 1. Introduction Iron is an essential element for most microorganisms [1,2]. Despite the abundance of iron in the earth’s crust, it is not readily bioavailable in aerobic environments due to its low solubility. Therefore most bacteria produce low molecular weight iron scavenging secondary metabolites to obtain iron from their environment [3,4], which are defined as siderophores [5]. These small, high-affinity iron-chelating secondary metabolites can be categorized into the four chemical classes catecholate, phenolate, hydroxamate and carboxylate types of siderophores on the basis of the structural moieties involved in iron chelation, whereby hybrids thereof are also commonly described [4,6]. Siderophores are typically synthetized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) modular multienzymes [7], whereas a smaller fraction of siderophores is produced by pathways that are independent of NRPSs and polyketide synthases (PKSs) such as desferrioxamine [8,9] or quinolobactin [10].

Myxobacteria not only display exceptional biological characteristics such as a complex chemical communication systems, multicellular development stages and the capability to move in coordinated manner to prey on other microorganisms [11] but are also producers of chemically exceptional and bioactive secondary metabolites [12]. Two different chemical types of siderophores are known to date from myxobacteria: the hydroxamate-type nannochelins [13] and the catecholate-type hyalachelins [14] and myxochelins [15,16], of which the latter have been investigated thoroughly in the last three decades [17,18,19].

Two different chemical types of siderophores are known to date from myxobacteria: the hydroxamate-type nannochelins [13] and the catecholate-type hyalachelins [14] and myxochelins [15,16], of which the latter have been investigated thoroughly in the last three decades [17,18,19]. The myxochelins are produced by numerous myxobacterial strains including Stigmatella aurantica sg a15 [20], Sorangium cellulosum So ce56 [21], Myxococcus xanthus DK 1622 [22,23] and Angiococcus disciformis An d30 [15] to maintain their iron homeostasis since it is indispensable for microbial viability [20]. These myxobacterial siderophores have been occasionally described or associated with other bacteria such as the actinomycetes Nonomuraea sp. TP-A0861 [24] and Steptomyces albicus m-9-20 [25] or the Chloroflexi bacterium Herpetosiphon aurantiacus [26]. Recently a number of new myxochelin derivatives have been isolated from different myxobacterial strains in which the common 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid has been replaced by a nicotinic acid moiety [17] or a 4,5-dihydroimidazole moiety [27]. Due to the relative simple structure of the myxochelins, chemical synthetic efforts led not only to the diversification of the aromatic scaffold [17,28] but also to the generation of hexadentate siderophores termed myxochelin C–F [16]. In addition, more myxochelin derivatives have been generated biotechnologically by precursor-directed biosynthesis [29]. However, to the best of our knowledge, except for myxochelin C, none of the described naturally produced myxochelins feature a modification of the primary alcohol or amino group.

We hereby report the isolation, full structure elucidation and propose a biosynthetic pathway leading to the uniquely modified myxochelin congener myxochelin-B-succinate (1) from the myxobacterial strain MSr12020 along the re-isolated congeners myxochelins B (2) and A (3) (Figure 1). The genetic origin of 1–3 was identified by in silico analysis and the biosynthetic conversion from 2 to 1 was further probed by in vitro reactions with the highly reactive intracellular metabolite succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) in order to reveal the non-enzymatic succinylation leading to the formation of 1.

At the end of fermentation, wet cell mass and adsorber resin XAD-16 were harvested together by centrifugation at 8000 rpm, 30 min and 4 °C. The crude extract was obtained from the fermentation broth via liquid acetone extraction; afterwards the acetone extract was dried under vacuum. The dried acetone extract (10.4 g) was then partitioned between methanol (MeOH) and n-hexane to remove fats. The MeOH layer was dried under vacuum to yield 6.6 g of extract. This extract was again sequentially partitioned in H2O and chloroform (CHCl3) followed by ethyl acetate (EA) partitioning. The non-aqueous extracts were dried in vacuo while the water portion was freeze-dried by lyophilization to yield a CHCl3 (2.86 g), EA (1.94 g) and H2O (1.8 g) extract.

The flow rate was 50 mL/min, UV/VIS absorption was set at 250 and 312 nm. Collected fractions (45 mL) were monitored on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to an amaZon ion trap MS (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA).

The myxochelin biosynthesis was elucidated by in vitro reconstitution of the complete biosynthetic pathway using the recombinantly produced core NRPS biosynthetic proteins MxcE–G as well as MxcL in Escherichia coli [18,19,21]. The biosynthesis of the myxochelins is initiated by ATP-dependent activation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) via the standalone adenylation domain MxcE. 2,3-DHBA is then transferred to the carrier protein of the bimodule MxcF, which contains an aryl-carrier protein (ArCP) domain and an isochorismate synthase (IC). Subsequently MxcF transfers two 2,3-DHBA units to MxcG for condensation with both, the α- and ε-side-chain amino groups of the activated lysine. The PCP-bound thioester intermediate is reduced and thereby released from the enzyme complex to yield aldehyde 4 which can undergo NAD(P)-H dependent catalyzed reduction to generate the corresponding alcohol 3 or reductive transamination by MxcL to produce 2 (Figure 5).

Therefore, it seems to be plausible that either a single enzyme is catalyzing the succinylation of 2 to yield 1 or a non-enzymatic reaction of 2 with the reactive intracellular metabolite succinyl-CoA generates 1.

Since careful genomic in silico analysis of the identified myxochelin BGC in the myxobacterial strain MSr12020 did not result in a potential co-localized gene candidate, which was expected to encode a transferase responsible for the catalytic conversion of 2 to 1 (Supplementary Materials, Figure S13, Table S5), we performed different in vitro reactions by incubating 2 or 3 with succinyl-CoA or succinate under physiological conditions in order to probe a possible non-enzymatic formation of 1. As expected, incubation of 2 or 3 with succinate did not yield any observable reaction product, whereas incubation of 2 with succinyl-CoA in fact revealed minor production of 1 (Figure 6A). This non-enzymatic reaction was clearly pH dependent, since in vitro reactions performed at pH 5.5 did only show minute amounts of 1, whereas the succinylation rate was highest at pH 10 (Figure 6B). Similar observations considering the pH dependency of non-enzymatic succinylation reactions have been reported previously [46,47]. Compound 3 was not succinylated under the tested conditions, which resembles the finding that we could not observe any myxochelin-A-succinyl derivative in the secondary metabolome of MSr12020. The higher nucleophilicity of the primary amine of 2 compared to the primary alcohol of 3 [48] might provide a reasonable explanation for this observation. Therefore, a possible mechanism for the succinylation of 2 might comprise the nucleophilic attack of a primary amino group on the carbonyl carbon of the succinyl group in succinyl-CoA. Accordingly, an alkaline pH accelerates the formation of a highly reactive cyclic succinic anhydride intermediate, which can react with the primary amine of 2 [49] (Figure 6C).

Due to the fact that myxochelin production is prevalent and conserved within the order of Myxococcales, we performed an extended survey investigating the occurrence of 1–3 across myxobacterial taxa, using a previously established collection of high-resolution HPLC-MS datasets from approx. 2600 myxobacterial strains [39]. The chosen parameters to evaluate those MS datasets considering the exact mass (exact mass deviation below 5 ppm), isotope pattern, and retention time matching (retention time deviation below 0.3 min) was adapted from a previous study investigating the presence of myxochelin congeners featuring nicotinic acid moieties [17]. This metabolomic survey revealed that 1 is a commonly observed byproduct of myxochelin B biosynthesis (Figure S14). The observed production titer of 1 displays a great bandwidth from being produced in trace amounts up to an equally produced congener such as 3 (Figure S15). Similarly to the secondary metabolome of MSr12020, we could not observe any molecular ion, which might account for a myxochelin-A-succinyl derivative in these myxobacterial HPLC-MS datasets. It is worth mentioning that the production of iron-chelating myxochelins in myxobacteria is strongly depending on the availability of iron in the fermentation medium; consequently fermentation media supplemented with ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is abolishing myxochelin production [17].

Taken together, these results do not entirely exclude that a tailoring enzyme is catalyzing the formation of 1 (in particular in those observed myxobacterial high producers), however such non-enzymatic succinylations of natural products seem not to be unprecedented as exemplified by the discovery of succinylated derivatives of the subclass IId bacteriocin BacSp222 [47]. Overall, our results indicate that non-enzymatic conversion of 2 seems to be a reasonable route leading to the formation of 1.

Discussion and Conclusions Succinylations as post-translational modification of proteins originating from bacteria, yeasts or animals were described in previous studies [50,51], whereas the modification in microbial secondary metabolite biosynthesis is a rather uncommon tailoring reaction. Examples of microbial natural products featuring succinyl substructures include the subtilin-like lantibiotic S-entianin [52], the lipopeptides cerexins [53] and succilins [54], the tetrahydroisoquinolines perquinolines A–C [55], the nonpeptide hydroxamate siderophores desferrioxamine [8], the fungal macrolides A26771B and berkeleylactone [56], the 24-membered macrolide 7-O-succinyl macrolactin A [57] and succinylated derivatives of the subclass IId bacteriocin BacSp222 (suc-K20-BacSp222 and suc-K11/suc-K20-BacSp222) [47] (Figure 7). The perquinolines A–C biosynthesis highlights a chemically interesting natural product assembly in which the biosynthesis is initiated by the condensation of succinyl-CoA and l-phenylalanine catalyzed by the amino-7-oxononanoate synthase-like enzyme PqrA [55]. In the course of the biosynthesis of the fungal macrolide antibiotic A26771B, the acyltransferase BerkE catalyzes the succinylation of the biosynthetic intermediate berklactone C to the succinylated intermediate berkeleylactone E [56]. The structural decoration of the 7-OH group of macrolactin A to its succinylated derivative O-succinyl macrolactin A is catalyzed by the a β-lactamase homolog BmmI, which could specifically attach C3–C5 alkyl acid thioesters and also exhibit substrate promiscuity toward acyl acceptors with different scaffolds [57].

Paralleling those aforementioned biosynthetic examples, the biosynthetic formation of the hydroxamate siderophores desferrioxamines involves the acyl-CoA-dependent acyl transferase DesC, which catalyzes the acylation of N-hydroxypentane-1,5-diamine (N-hydroxycadaverine) with succinyl- and acetyl-CoA to form N-hydroxy-N-acetyl-cadaverine (HAC) and N-hydroxy-N-succinyl-cadaverine (HSC) [58]. While for those natural product classes the catalysis of succinylation was identified by acyl-transferase-like proteins, the underlying succinylation mechanism of other natural product classes such as the subtilin-like lantibiotic S-entianin [52], the lipopeptides cerexins [53] and succilins [54] elusive at present.

In summary, this study describes the discovery, isolation, full structure elucidation and a possible biosynthetic pathway of 1 which shows in contrast to previous naturally and semi-synthetically produced myxochelins a unique succinylation decoration on the primary amino group. Although the biological and iron-chelation function of the succinyl group of 1 remains elusive, we observed that the succinylation of 2 leads to a significant reduction in antibacterial activity. In silico genome analysis of the myxobacterium MSr12020 revealed the genetic origin of 1–3 and in vitro experiments display the possibility that 1 might be biosynthesized by non-enzymatic succinylation of 2 with the highly reactive intracellular metabolite succinyl-CoA. Further confirmation of this finding would hint towards interesting biological implications regarding the purpose of succinylation during the biosynthesis of natural products and as posttranslational modification. It seems that both enzymatic and non-enzymatic succinylations play a central role in living (micro)organisms [59], and future studies might provide a better understanding concerning the imposing consequences of these chemical modifications. Thus, the discovery and proposed biosynthesis of 1 from the myxobacterium MSr12020 provides an intriguing puzzle piece of natural product succinylation.
