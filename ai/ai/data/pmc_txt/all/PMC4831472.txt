Abstract Kalimantacin is an antimicrobial compound with strong antistaphylococcal activity that is produced by a hybrid trans‐acyltransferase polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase system in Pseudomonas fluorescens 
BCCM_ID9359. We here present a systematic analysis of the substrate specificity of the glycine‐incorporating adenylation domain from the kalimantacin biosynthetic assembly line by a targeted mutagenesis approach. The specificity‐conferring code was adapted for use in Pseudomonas and mutated adenylation domain active site sequences were introduced in the kalimantacin gene cluster, using a newly adapted ligation independent cloning method. Antimicrobial activity screens and LC‐MS analyses revealed that the production of the kalimantacin analogues in the mutated strains was abolished. These results support the idea that further insight in the specificity of downstream domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases is required to efficiently engineer these strains in vivo.

2016; 5(2): 279–286 Introduction Introduction Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) and polyketides (PKs) are two major classes of secondary metabolites with important therapeutic properties, such as antibiotic, antifungal, immunosuppressive, or antitumor activities. They are produced in bacteria and fungi by multimodular enzymatic assembly lines, known as nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs), respectively (Finking and Marahiel 2004; Smith and Tsai 2007). Due to similarities in their modular organization and biosynthetic strategies, PKSs and NRPSs are able to assemble into hybrid multienzyme complexes (Du et al. 2001). Kalimantacin, an antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens BCCM_ID9359, is produced by such a hybrid NRPS‐PKS system and its biosynthetic pathway has been fully elucidated (Fig. 1) (Mattheus et al. 2010a). The kalimantacin enzymatic assembly line is composed of three polypeptides (Bat1, Bat2, and Bat3), harboring 11 trans‐acyltransferase (AT) PKS modules and one NRPS module. The latter incorporates glycine into the PK backbone and is situated in the first module of Bat2 (Bat2mod1). During and after assembly line biosynthesis, kalimantacin is modified by several trans‐acting tailoring enzymes (Fig. 1) (Mattheus et al. 2010a). Kalimantacin exerts strong antagonistic activity against staphylococci (MIC 0.05 μg/mL) and has moderate activity against enterobacteria (MIC 1–10 μg/mL). It acts by inhibiting the trans‐2‐enoyl‐ acyl carrier protein (ACP)‐reductase (FabI), an enzyme responsible for the final step in bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis (Mattheus et al. 2010b).

Figure 1Biosynthetic pathway and structure of kalimantacin. Biosynthesis of kalimantacin is initiated in the loading module by the trans‐acting acyltransferase BatH, which loads an acetyl‐CoA unit onto the first ACP. A second trans‐AT, BatJ, selectively delivers malonyl‐CoA to the 11 remaining PKS‐modules in the biosynthetic pathway. The NRPS‐module in Bat2 incorporates a glycine residue into the growing intermediate. BatA‐E, BatK, BatF, and BatM perform several on‐ and post‐PKS tailoring reactions to produce the final bioactive compound. KS, ketosynthase; KR, ketoreductase; DH, dehydratase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; MT, methyltransferase; C, condensation domain; A, adenylation domain; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein; TE, thioesterase; AA, amino acid.

Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) modules typically consist of a condensation (C) domain for peptide bond formation, an adenylation (A) domain for selection and activation of the cognate amino acid (AA) building block and a thiolation (T) domain or peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) that covalently tethers the growing intermediate to the enzyme complex (Finking and Marahiel 2004). NRPs exhibit a high structural diversity, which is partly determined by the substrate specificity of the A domains (Lautru and Challis 2004). Aside from the 22 proteinogenic AA, A domains can additionally introduce nonproteinogenic AAs and α‐hydroxy acids as well as nonsubstituted carboxylic acids. The substrate‐binding pocket of A domains is lined by 10 AA residues that determine the nature of the AA that is incorporated into the NRP backbone. This specificity‐conferring code can be bioinformatically extracted and enables the structure prediction of new NRPs based on the genomic arrangement of the corresponding biosynthetic genes (Stachelhaus et al. 1999; Challis et al. 2000; Röttig et al. 2011). This has already been exploited to rationally alter the specificity of A domains by targeted mutagenesis. So far, only relatively small changes in A domain specificity, for example, Asp to Asn, Glu to Gln, Phe to Tyr, have been achieved in in vitro experiments with purified mutant A domains (Stachelhaus et al. 1999; Eppelmann et al. 2002; Stevens et al. 2006). Recently, the Phe‐incorporating A domain of gramicidin synthetase (GrsA) has been successfully re‐engineered to introduce azide‐ and alkyne‐substituted AA (Kries et al. 2014). Attempts to drastically change the substrate specificity have resulted in a decrease in the A domain activity (Chen et al. 2009). In vivo efforts to create NRP analogues with variations in AA composition by targeted mutagenesis of A domains appear to be even more challenging (Eppelmann et al. 2002; Uguru et al. 2004; Han et al. 2012; Thirlway et al. 2012). In this study, we attempted to rationally and systematically change the specificity of the glycine‐incorporating A domain in the NRPS module of the kalimantacin biosynthetic assembly line by using a new targeted mutagenesis approach and a specificity‐conferring code designed for use in Pseudomonas. The functionality and specificity of the mutated A domains were subsequently analyzed by ultrahigh‐resolution LC‐MS analysis of culture supernatants.

To easily detect mutated active site introduction, a plasmid containing the 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences was constructed, flanking the gentamicin resistance gene. All fragments were amplified by tailed primers introducing restriction sites (as listed in Table S2). After restriction, they were ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The construct was verified by sequence analysis. This construct was introduced in the genome of P. fluorescens BCCM_ID9359 by biparental conjugation with E. coli S17‐1. Both strains were grown to late exponential phase and mixed on a sterile 0.45 μm Millipore filter on tryptose agar. After overnight incubation, the filter was washed with 1 mL 0.9% sodium chloride and plated on tryptose agar supplemented with kanamycin and triclosan to select for vector integration by a first crossover event. Next, colonies were incubated overnight in tryptose broth without any selection to enable vector excision and plated in serial dilutions on tryptose agar with 5% w/v sucrose. Colonies were then checked by replica plating on tryptose agar with gentamicin and tryptose agar with kanamycin. Gentamicin‐resistant, but kanamycin‐sensitive clones were verified by PCR with primers external of the 5′ and 3′ flanking region and the amplified region was then verified by sequence analysis.

Results Results Generation of a Pseudomonas‐specific specificity‐conferring code Generation of a Pseudomonas‐specific specificity‐conferring code Generation of a Pseudomonas‐specific specificity‐conferring code Research into the specificity‐conferring code of A domains has revealed that genus‐specific variations exist at specific positions in the code (Challis et al. 2000), which hint at “wobble‐like” positions (Stachelhaus et al. 1999). Therefore, we hypothesized that the specificity of mutated A domains can be improved by the use of a genus‐specific code. A literature wide study was performed, searching for NRPSs with characterized products in Pseudomonas spp. and the different specificity‐conferring codes of the A domains were extracted using NRPSpredictor2 (Table S1) (Röttig et al. 2011). Since all of these codes were derived from Pseudomonas sequences, they were considered Pseudomonas specific, or at least compatible. For each position in the specificity‐conferring code, the most commonly encountered AA was selected and preference was given to AAs present in A domains from NRPSs in P. fluorescens spp. As such, 10 specificity‐conferring codes were designed with the aim of replacing Gly in the final structure of kalimantacin with 10 alternative AAs, namely Ala, Leu, Val, Ser, Cys, Arg, Asp, Gln, Phe, and Pro, representing different natural AA classes (Table 1).

Ligation independent cloning enables efficient introduction of mutated active site fragments Ligation independent cloning enables efficient introduction of mutated active site fragments Ligation independent cloning enables efficient introduction of mutated active site fragments To introduce these adapted specificity‐conferring codes in the A domain of Bat2mod1, the positions of the 10 AAs in Bat2mod1 that comprise the original code were identified by sequence alignments with the archetypic GrsA (Stachelhaus et al. 1999; Challis et al. 2000). Taking into account the codon usage of Pseudomonas protegens Pf5, DNA fragments encoding the altered specificity‐conferring codes were designed. The specificity of these A domains was verified with NRPSpredictor2, using the nearest neighbor method (Röttig et al. 2011). All codes were predicted to introduce the intended AA with a score of 90%, except for Gln, which would be introduced with a predicted score of 60%. Chemically synthesized gene fragments containing the correct mutations were cloned into a pUC18 (Invitrogen™) plasmid, containing the two flanking regions (±350 base pairs (bp) and 500 bp) of the mutated active site, using an adapted ligation independent cloning approach. An overlap of 12 bp between the flanking fragments and the synthetic DNA fragment allowed efficient ligation independent cloning, as illustrated in Figure 2 (Thieme et al. 2011). Following sequence analysis, the complete fragment, comprising the 5′ and 3′ flanking regions and the mutated active site sequence, was transferred to suicide vector pAKE604 (El‐Sayed et al. 2003) via regular restriction and ligation.

Discussion and Conclusion Discussion and Conclusion As a proof of concept, a Pseudomonas‐specific code was created in this article for A domains. Since, as far as we know, no specificity‐conferring codes for other genera have been published, it is difficult to compare this code with codes in other genera. However, when comparing the specificity‐conferring code of the archetypic Phe‐incorporating module of GrsA (DAWTIAAICK) with the presented code for use in Pseudomonas (DAPIMGGTCK), the difference between both codes is remarkable, with six out of 10 AA differing. Two of these six AA, at GrsA positions 301 and 322, are rather small changes, going from two times Ala to two times Gly, thus removing two small neutral groups out of the binding pocket. The other changes seem more drastic, as polar groups change into neutral groups or vice versa. It should be noted that changes do not necessarily imply drastic differences between codes in different genera. If the Pro‐incorporating sequence is compared to the consensus sequence proposed by Stachelhaus and colleagues, only one of all AA is changed (from Tyr to Leu). As it goes with codon optimization, it is possible that optimizing the specificity‐conferring code, as is done here for Pseudomonas, improves the yield, but does not necessarily mean that a code from another organism does not give any result at all. As a proof of concept, a Pseudomonas‐specific code was created in this article for A domains. Since, as far as we know, no specificity‐conferring codes for other genera have been published, it is difficult to compare this code with codes in other genera.

The bioassay of the positive control, showing wild‐type activity again, proves the robustness of the method presented. Overall, this method is very efficient for the in gene replacement of active site sequences. Furthermore, chemical synthesis of the mutated DNA fragments circumvents an elaborate targeted point mutation approach. Therefore, this method is particularly suited for systematic in vivo analyses of mutated A domains.

Therefore, this method is particularly suited for systematic in vivo analyses of mutated A domains. All bioassays show a residual activity of both mutant strains and extracts, comparable to the batC deletion mutant. Since LC‐MS analyses show no detectable amounts of kalimantacin and it seems unlikely that all mutants produce the same kalimantacin intermediate as the batC knockout strain, this activity can only be explained by another, unrelated secondary metabolite produced by the P. fluorescens strain, with low but distinguishable activity against S. aureus ATCC27661. Additional bioassays against a collection of gram‐positive and gram‐negative strains showed that all mutant strains and the wild‐type strain have a similar activity against different Pseudomonas strains (data not shown), indicating that other antibacterial secondary metabolites are indeed produced by P. fluorescens BCCM_ID9359.

There are a number of possible reasons why the kalimantacin biosynthetic assembly lines harboring the mutated A domains are no longer functional. First, the Pseudomonas‐specific code might not be sufficiently adapted. However, all the critical conserved AA residues as proposed by Challis and colleagues (Challis et al. 2000) are present in each of the designed specificity‐conferring codes. In vitro analysis of the specificity of the engineered A domains could shed more light on this. Furthermore, working in an in vivo system, downstream domains might not accept the alternative biosynthetic intermediates. Indeed, it has recently been shown that ketosynthase (KS) domains in trans‐AT PKSs show specificity to the growing intermediate as well (Jenner et al. 2013). In addition, a recent paper by Kohlhaas and coworkers on the specificity in hybrid trans‐AT PKS/NRPS clusters confirms that the AA‐accepting KS domains possess a high specificity for NRPS‐derived intermediates (Kohlhaas et al. 2013). In the kalimantacin cluster, this is expected to be the case for the KS domain of module 2 in Bat2. Engineering the substrate selectivity of this KS domain or replacing it with a KS domain that has an increased substrate tolerance could potentially resolve this issue. Not only the downstream domains could block synthesis, different studies have shown that the acceptor site of the C domain could also possess substrate selectivity (Belshaw et al. 1999; Ehmann et al. 2000). As such, it is possible that the A domain is active, while the C domain is not accepting the alternative building block. This selectivity of the C domain was recently demonstrated by Calcott et al. (2014) in the pyoverdine synthetase PvdD in P. aeruginosa, and could also explain why the in vivo system in the P. fluorescens strain in this study is blocked.

In this article, we present an efficient method to introduce mutated active site sequences in the biosynthetic gene clusters. However, more insight is needed in the specificity of upstream and downstream domains to rationally engineer A domains in hybrid trans‐AT PKS/NRPS clusters.
