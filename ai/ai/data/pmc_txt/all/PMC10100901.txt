ABSTRACT In this study, a novel actinomycete strain, DSD3025T, isolated from the underexplored marine sediments in Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, Sulu Sea, Philippines, with the proposed name Streptomyces tubbatahanensis sp. nov., was described using polyphasic approaches and characterized using whole-genome sequencing. Its specialized metabolites were profiled using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, followed by antibacterial, anticancer, and toxicity screening. The S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome was comprised of 7.76 Mbp with a 72.3% G+C content. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values were 96.5% and 64.1%, respectively, compared with its closest related species, thus delineating the novelty of Streptomyces species. The genome encoded 29 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), including a BGC region containing tryptophan halogenase and its associated flavin reductase, which were not found in its close Streptomyces relatives. The metabolite profiling unfolded six rare halogenated carbazole alkaloids, with chlocarbazomycin A as the major compound. A biosynthetic pathway for chlocarbazomycin A was proposed using genome mining, metabolomics, and bioinformatics platforms. Chlocarbazomycin A produced by S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T has antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA-44 and Streptococcus pyogenes and showed antiproliferative activity against colon (HCT-116) and ovarian (A2780) human cancer cell lines. Chlocarbazomycin A exhibited no toxicity to liver cells but moderate and high toxicity to kidney and cardiac cell lines, respectively. IMPORTANCE
Streptomyces tubbatahanensis DSD3025T is a novel actinomycete with antibiotic and anticancer activities from Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site in Sulu Sea and considered one of the Philippines’ oldest and most-well-protected marine ecosystems. In silico genome mining tools were used to identify putative BGCs that led to the discovery of genes involved in the production of halogenated carbazole alkaloids and new natural products. By integrating bioinformatics-driven genome mining and metabolomics, we unearthed the hidden biosynthetic richness and mined the associated chemical entities from the novel Streptomyces species. The bioprospecting of novel Streptomyces species from marine sediments of underexplored ecological niches serves as an important source of antibiotic and anticancer drug leads with unique chemical scaffolds. KEYWORDS INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Identifying novel Streptomyces species is crucial in the search for new specialized metabolites with antibiotic and anticancer activities. This undertaking can address the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (1). Members of the phylum Actinobacteria serve as a primary source of specialized metabolites that comprise 10% of the 211,000 described bacterial sequences in the NCBI database (2). From the 39% estimated Actinobacteria specialized metabolites (3), 80% were produced by members in the genus Streptomyces. In fact, 5 to 10% of the Streptomyces genome is dedicated to specialized metabolism, and most of the products remained undiscovered (4). The specialized metabolites from Streptomyces species are largely represented by nonribosomal peptides and polyketides (5). These compounds can have a wide array of bioactivities, such as antimicrobial, anticancer, antiparasitic, or immunosuppressant activities, or other therapeutic agents (6).

There are more than 4,700 halogenated compounds reported for which the halogen moiety is important for target specificity and enhances the compound’s pharmacological activities (7). In 2021, 14 of 50 molecules approved by the FDA were halogen-containing drugs that displayed a broad range of antibiotic and anticancer activities (8). The genus Streptomyces produces a diverse set of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), accounting for 20 to 40 genomic regions for specialized metabolites biosynthesis (9) which conventional strategies fail to uncover. The advancements in genomics, bioinformatics, and metabolomics have accelerated the identification and isolation of chemically diverse natural products (10). Some of the well-known chlorinated specialized metabolites derived from Streptomyces are the antibiotics vancomycin (11) and chloramphenicol (12), the antitumor agent rebeccamycin (13), and the antifungal agent pyrrolnitrin (14).

Traditionally, compounds from a bioactive microbial strain were isolated by bioassay-guided approaches (15, 16). Meanwhile, bioinformatics-driven predictions using whole-genome sequencing have uncovered the core BGCs and cryptic metabolites, followed by the integration of high-resolution metabolomics (17) for specialized metabolite identification. The genome-based bioprospecting (17) and metabolomics-enabled approaches (18) opened a new era in natural product drug discovery and development.

From January 2015 to December 2020, there was a rising number of Streptomyces species isolated from different ecological niches (19). During these 6 years, 135 new Streptomyces species were recovered from terrestrial (n = 108) and marine (n = 27) sources, highlighting 121 Streptomyces species as prolific producers of 279 new specialized metabolites with wide pharmaceutical applications (19). In the year 2020 alone, 74 novel specialized metabolites were identified from Streptomyces species, with the largest portion isolated from marine-derived Streptomyces (20). From 2015 to 2020, 71% of the novel marine-derived Streptomyces species were recovered from marine sediments (19). These reports demonstrated that novel Streptomyces species from marine sediments play a significant role as sources of new bioactive specialized metabolites.

In the last 5 years, our laboratory has explored the marine sediments of the Philippine archipelago for antibiotic- and anticancer-producing Streptomyces and has reported the bioactive specialized metabolites they produce (15, 21–23). In the present study, a novel Streptomyces strain isolated from marine sediments of Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park in the middle of Sulu Sea, Philippines, was investigated for its phylogenetic, phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and genomic features, based on its whole-genome sequence. Based on this array of testing and data analyses, marine sediment-derived actinomycete strain DSD3025T is proposed to represent a novel Streptomyces species named Streptomyces tubbatahanensis sp. nov. (DSD3025T = DSM 33792T).

The antibiotic and anticancer potentials of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T were explored via genome mining, metabolite profiling, bioinformatics, and bioassays. The S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome encodes 29 putative BGCs, including a BGC of interest that contains tryptophan halogenase and flavin reductase genes, a two-component halogenase/reductase system. The bioinformatics analysis and BGC evaluation predicted compounds belonging to PKS I, PKS II, and NRPS moieties. Metabolite profiling of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T crude extract by using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-TOF-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis identified chlocarbazomycin A compound 1, a recently discovered halogenated carbazole alkaloid, from its closely related Streptomyces species as a metabolite. Aside from compound 1, several halogenated compounds were produced by S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T. The extract induced cell death via membrane damage of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA-44 and inhibited growth proliferation of MCF-7, HCT-116, and A2780 cancer cell lines. Moreover, compound 1 had antibacterial activity against S. aureus ATCC BAA-44 and Streptococcus pyogenes and showed antiproliferative activity against HCT-116 and A2780 cancer cell lines.

Based on MLSA, the evolutionary distance between S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T and its closely related Streptomyces species was 0.0107 (Fig. 2A), which was above the cutoff value of 0.007 to delineate novel species under the genus Streptomyces (25). To further validate the species delineation of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T, the digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) and orthologous average nucleotide identity (orthoANI) values were calculated to validate the taxonomic status as a novel species. The dDDH values between S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T and its closely related matches ranged from 22.1 to 64.1% (Fig. 2A), which were below the threshold value of 70% (26). Notably, S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T and its nearest species neighbor, S. diacarni LHW51701T, had a dDDH value of 64.1%. In addition, S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T showed an orthoANI value of 96.49% with S. diacarni LHW51701T (Fig. 2B).

S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T had moderate growth in MM11 and ISP9. Poor growth was observed in mannitol-containing agar (MM3) and ISP4. No diffusible pigment was produced by the strain in the different culture media. The API ZYM is a system used to detect selected enzymes in S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T. After 4 h of incubation, the results were assessed based on the standard reading table of the API ZYM system (Fig. S4). Of 19 enzymatic reactions, S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T showed seven positive enzymatic activities for alkaline phosphate, esterase (C4), leucine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, and naphthol phosphohydrolase and weakly positive activities for esterase and lipase (C8) and α-glucosidase enzymes (Table S6).

In silico specialized metabolite analysis of BGC in S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T. In silico specialized metabolite analysis of BGC in S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T. In silico specialized metabolite analysis of BGC in S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T. The 29 clusters predicted by antiSMASH (v.7.0) were associated with the production of BGCs consisting of nonribosomal peptides, indole biosynthesis, siderophore, type-1 (T1PKS) and type-2 (T2PKS) polyketides, posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPP-like), thiopeptides, and lanthipeptides (Table 4). BGCs 9, 10, and 21 have 100% similarity with known BGCs encoding desferrioxamine E, ectoine, and marineosin A and B, respectively. The remaining clusters with <70% similarity to known specialized metabolites were identified as NRPS, indole, terpene, T1PKS, T2PKS, siderophore, lanthipeptides, betalactone, and thiopeptides. Notably, BGC regions 2, 3, 11, 15, 18, and 27 had no similarity with the reference specialized metabolites, indicating the novelty of the BGCs in S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T. Since S. diacarni LHW51701T was the nearest neighbor in the phylogenetic analysis, we compared its BGCs to S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T. We noted similar BGCs encoded between two species for the biosynthesis of marineosin A and B, desferrioxamine E, ectoine, reductasporine, SapB, ebelactone, and hopene (31). We explored the biosynthetic potential of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T by examining the putative core structures of the compounds produced by the NRPS and some PKS BGCs (using PRISM4) (Fig. S6), as well as the predicted core peptides of the RiPPs (detected using BAGEL4) (Fig. S7).

Based on BGC analysis and comparison to known databases, the BGC region 1 of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T resembled the BGC architecture of recently discovered cyclic halogenated lipoglycopeptide gausemycins A and B from Streptomyces (32). The unique structural features of the gausemycins A and B gene clusters were found in S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T BGC region 1, including the core gauA, gauB, gauC, and gauD NRPS gene homologs, as well as the incorporation of 4-chlorokynurenine (4-Cl-Kyn) (33) and 2-amino-4-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyric acid. The halogenation and conversion of tryptophan to 4-Cl-Kyn were facilitated by a tryptophan 6-halogenase (tar14) (33), flavin reductase, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, and a putative α/β-hydrolase, for which the homologs were found in BGC region 1 of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T.

The conserved motifs of this FADH2-dependent halogenase (FDH) included a putative flavin-binding motif (GxGxxG) located at the amino-terminal end (34), a C-terminal motif (WxWxIP) found in the middle of the sequence (34) that prevents monooxygenase substrate binding near the flavin (35, 36), and other conserved motifs identified in the halogenase genes of motifs such as GVGEAT and FVEPLESTG (37, 38). The lysine and glutamate catalytic residues highly conserved in FDHs were also observed in the tryptophan halogenase homolog sequence of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the tryptophan halogenase of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T formed a separate clade, together with tar14 and other bacterial C-6 halogenases (sttH, ktzR, and th-Hal) (39–41) (Fig. S8), suggesting that the tryptophan halogenase of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T was a tryptophan FDH that may catalyze site-selective C-6 halogenation of specialized metabolites instead of the C-7 halogenation annotated from the whole-genome sequence analysis.

Given that S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T produced halogenated metabolites based on MS analysis, it was envisaged that a flavin-dependent tryptophan 6-halogenase catalyzed the halogenation of these specialized metabolites (Fig. 6). Carbazole alkaloids utilize tryptophan as a precursor in their biosynthesis (44). The indole nucleus in tryptophan contributes to rings B and C during carbazole biosynthesis; thus, the detected tryptophan 6-halogenase encoded in the S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome may facilitate the halogenation of carbazole alkaloids at the C-7 of ring C (Fig. 6).

The halometabolite detected at m/z 232.0521 [M + H]+ putatively identified as compound 1 was set as the target mass for isolation due to its relatively higher abundance compared to other halometabolites in S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T extract.

The purification of 1 yielded 80% purity as estimated via 1H NMR. Notably, Streptomyces tubbatahanensis DSD3025T is a relatively more prolific producer of halometabolites, producing 7 times more than its related strain, Streptomyces diacarni LHW51701T (45).

Compound 1 was unambiguously identified by NMR spectroscopic data (Table S9) based on 1H, 1H-decoupled, 13C, 13C DEPTQ135, 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC), and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) NMR spectral analyses (Fig. S33 to S48). The purity of the sample was approximately 80%, as determined by dividing the integral value of the −OCH3 peak of the compound by the total integral value of the −OCH3 peak of the compound and methyl peak of fatty acid impurities in the aliphatic region (2.0 to 2.15 ppm) of the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S34). Data from J value, COSY, and NOESY were used to determine the position of chlorine in the elucidated compound. NOESY data showed correlations between −NH and H1 (Fig. S47), indicating that H1 was in proximity with −NH and that chlorine was positioned in C-4 of carbazole ring A. In addition, NOESY data demonstrated a correlation between H2 and −OCH3, suggesting that these protons were also in proximity and chlorine was adjacent to the −OCH3 of 1. These NOESY correlations indicated that the halogenation occurred at C-4 of carbazole ring A, indicating that compound 1 isolated from S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T has the structure of chlocarbazomycin A, as reported previously from its closely related Streptomyces strain, S. diacarni LHW51701T (43, 45). These NOESY correlations were verified by measuring the distances between NH and H1 (2.8 Å) and between H2 and −OCH3 (1.9 Å) using Chemdraw 3D v21.0.0 (Fig. S48). The correlation between H1 and H2 identified in the COSY spectrum (Fig. S41) and the calculated J value of 8.7 Hz from the 1H NMR spectrum showed that H1 and H2 were adjacent to each other (3J) and that the chlorination occurred at C-4 of carbazole ring A.

Compound 1 was unambiguously identified by NMR spectroscopic data (Table S9) based on 1H, 1H-decoupled, 13C, 13C DEPTQ135, 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC), and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) NMR spectral analyses (Fig. S33 to S48). The purity of the sample was approximately 80%, as determined by dividing the integral value of the −OCH3 peak of the compound by the total integral value of the −OCH3 peak of the compound and methyl peak of fatty acid impurities in the aliphatic region (2.0 to 2.15 ppm) of the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S34). Data from J value, COSY, and NOESY were used to determine the position of chlorine in the elucidated compound. NOESY data showed correlations between −NH and H1 (Fig. S47), indicating that H1 was in proximity with −NH and that chlorine was positioned in C-4 of carbazole ring A. In addition, NOESY data demonstrated a correlation between H2 and −OCH3, suggesting that these protons were also in proximity and chlorine was adjacent to the −OCH3 of 1. These NOESY correlations indicated that the halogenation occurred at C-4 of carbazole ring A, indicating that compound 1 isolated from S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T has the structure of chlocarbazomycin A, as reported previously from its closely related Streptomyces strain, S. diacarni LHW51701T (43, 45). These NOESY correlations were verified by measuring the distances between NH and H1 (2.8 Å) and between H2 and −OCH3 (1.9 Å) using Chemdraw 3D v21.0.0 (Fig. S48). The correlation between H1 and H2 identified in the COSY spectrum (Fig. S41) and the calculated J value of 8.7 Hz from the 1H NMR spectrum showed that H1 and H2 were adjacent to each other (3J) and that the chlorination occurred at C-4 of carbazole ring A. Putative biosynthesis of chlocarbazomycin A compound 1. Putative biosynthesis of chlocarbazomycin A compound 1. Putative biosynthesis of chlocarbazomycin A compound 1. Although compound 1 was first isolated just recently from S. diacarni strains (43, 45), its biosynthetic pathway was unknown. To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of 1, two separate libraries of compounds were created: (i) known halogenated microbial secondary metabolites from tryptophan halogenase precursors, including intermediates in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin and pyrrolnitrin (Table S10), to deduce whether halogenation occurred before the closure of ring A to form the tricyclic carbazole alkaloid ring; and (ii) nonhalogenated carbazole alkaloids and indolocarbazoles (Table S11), to deduce whether halogenation occurred after tricyclic carbazole ring formation. Mining of the accurate mass of listed compounds and their adducts. [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, [M + K]+, [M + MeCN + H]+, and [M − H]−, in the mass spectrometry data showed no hits for compounds and intermediates for biosynthesis of rebeccamycin and pyrrolnitrin (Table S10) but showed 3 hits for nonhalogenated carbazole alkaloids and indolocarbazoles (Table S11), namely, carbazomycin B compound 8 and H and carbazoquinocin F (Fig. S49 to S53). Compound 8 was identified based on MS and MS/MS analyses (Fig. S50 and S51), while carbazomycin H and carbazoquinocin F were identified based on the chemical formula, isotope model, and double bond equivalent (Fig. S52 and S53). The absence of intermediates from the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin and pyrrolnitrin, including the chlorinated rebeccamycin analogs, and the detection of nonhalogenated carbazole alkaloids in S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T suggested that the chlorination most likely occurred after the tricyclic carbazole ring formation, i.e., after the closure of ring A, similar to the biosynthesis of tricyclic carbazoles such as neocarazostatins (44).

The carbazole alkaloids, such as neocarazostatin A and compound 8, produced by bacteria have a carbazole nucleus derived from tryptophan, pyruvate, and acetate (46–48). The biosynthetic pathway of 1 proposed in this study (Fig. 7) followed the initial formation of a carbazole nucleus, as observed in the biosynthesis of 8 (49). Comprehensive genome mining and bioinformatics allowed the retrieval of a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster (chlCz) in BGC region 16 spanning approximately 22.3 kB, with open reading frames (ORFs) involved in the formation of chlorinated carbazole alkaloids (Fig. 8, Table 5). The genome mining and gene cluster comparison with neocarazostatin A (44) and compound 8 (49) unveiled the key biosynthetic genes clustered in one BGC region of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T (Table 5) for the formation of a tricyclic carbazole skeleton. The first step of carbazole assembly was the conversion of tryptophan into indole-3-pyruvate catalyzed by a putative aminotransferase chlCz1 (nzsD homolog in NZS biosynthesis) that shared 97.5% homology with histidinol-phosphate transaminase of S. diacarni LHW51701T. A thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme, chlCz2 (nzsH homolog in NZS biosynthesis), with 97.3% gene similarity to a thiamine pyrophosphate-binding protein of S. diacarni LHW51701T catalyzed the C-C bond between indole-3-pyruvate and pyruvate to form α-hydroxy-β-keto acid 9.

In contrast with the reported biosynthesis of neocarazostatin A that utilized the β-hydroxy group as its acyl substrate, the chlCz3 (nzsJ homolog in NZS biosynthesis) with 98.8% gene similarity to 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase of S. diacarni LHW51701T recognized only the acetyl-ACP as its non-β-hydroxyl acyl substrate (50) for carbazomycin biosynthesis. The unprecedented chlCz3 is a putative 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (KASIII) that possesses an acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA):ACP transacylase (ACAT) activity (51) for the catalytic formation of acetyl-ACP from acetyl-CoA and an acyl carrier protein, chlCz4 (nzsE homolog in NZS biosynthesis), with 98.8% gene similarity to an ACP in S. diacarni LHW51701T. The acetyl-ACP may serve as a substrate for the side chain moiety of carbazomycins, since acetyl-ACP can be considered a starter unit for straight-chain fatty acid biosynthesis in Streptomyces (52). chlCz3 catalyzed the condensation of α-hydroxy-β-keto acid and acetyl-ACP. The unstable intermediate formed by the chlCz3-catalyzed reaction would undergo cyclization and ring A formation of the carbazole nucleus mediated by the putative carbazole synthase chlCz5 (nzsI homolog in NZS biosynthesis) that shared 100% gene homology to an SRPBCC family protein harbored by the S. diacarni LHW51701T genome.

It was noted that 8 was a dihydroxyl type of carbazole metabolite, where its catechol intermediate 14 was initiated by dehydration to form 12 and nucleophilic aromatization to form 13 in a reaction catalyzed by chlCz5 (nzsI homolog in NZS biosynthesis) (53) (Fig. 7). Interestingly, 1 produced by S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T was plausibly catalyzed from a mono-hydroxyl type of carbazole intermediate 15, where the reduction and ring rearrangement steps were mediated by chlCz5 (Table 5) (53). This unusual biosynthetic reaction catalyzed by chlCz5 may uncover the key gene machinery to generate the putative intermediate 15 of chlocarbazomycin metabolites. The genomics, metabolomics, and bioinformatics analyses suggested that 1 and 8 may have a similar unstable intermediate, compound 11, catalyzed by the carbazole synthase chlCz5, but they have different biosynthetic architectures in the carbazole ring A assembly (Fig. 7). The two-step oxidation and decarboxylation of 15 catalyzed by the putative chlCz6a/chlCz6b FAD binding or FAD dependent and the chlCz7a/chlCz7b SDR family oxidoreductases were plausibly initiated to remove the methyl groups attached in C-1 and C-2 of the carbazole ring A, forming intermediates 17 and 19, respectively (Fig. 7). All the putative genes involved in the biosynthesis of 1 until intermediate 19 were found in BGC region 16 of the S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome (Fig. 8).

All the putative genes involved in the biosynthesis of 1 until intermediate 19 were found in BGC region 16 of the S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome (Fig. 8). The hydroxyl group in C-3 of carbazole ring A in 1 was converted into a methoxy side chain catalyzed by a putative O-methyltransferase, chlCz8 (93.2% gene similarity with a methyltransferase of S. diacarni LHW51701T), which resulted in the formation of a tricyclic carbazole, 20, with no C-1 or C-2 methyl side chains (50). Interestingly, chlCz8 was found outside the chlCz gene cluster (Table 5). The carbazole backbone of compounds 1 and 8 was mainly catalyzed by the putative KAS-III chlCz3 and the putative carbazole synthase chlCz5, as in the case of neocarazostatin A (50).

The carbazole backbone of compounds 1 and 8 was mainly catalyzed by the putative KAS-III chlCz3 and the putative carbazole synthase chlCz5, as in the case of neocarazostatin A (50).

The putative halogenase (chlCz9) gene involved in the chlorination at C-4 of carbazole ring A was proposed to be located outside the chlCz gene cluster. The chlCz8 and chlCz9 adjacent in the genome were located approximately 2.1 Mbp away from the chlCz gene cluster of DSD3025T and had opposite gene orientations with their corresponding gene homologs in the LHW51701T genome (Fig. 8).

In the search for a halogenase in S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome, the tryptophan 6-halogenase was thought to be the gene responsible for the chlorination of C-4 in 1. However, the NMR analysis confirmed that the chlorine attachment in 1 was in C-4 of carbazole ring A and not in C-7 of the carbazole ring C, thus demonstrating that the tryptophan 6-halogenase was not responsible for this chlorination process. Notably, a putative single-component flavin-dependent halogenase (FDH), chlCz9, located outside the carbazomycin B gene cluster could be a bifunctional protein capable of chlorination and unusual flavin reduction. chlCz9 was annotated by antiSMASH as a NAD(P)- and/or FAD-dependent oxidoreductase that may act on aromatic substrates (54) with tryptophan as a precursor, but not directly with tryptophan. The gene comparison in databases revealed 95.1% similarity with a NAD(P)- and/or FAD-dependent oxidoreductase harbored in the genome of a chlocarbazomycin producer, S. diacarni LHW51701T, and <50% gene similarity with halogenases. The NAD(P)- and FAD-dependent oxidoreductase as an FDH that could compensate for the chlorination of C-4 in carbazole ring A warrants further gene expression and in vitro experiments (54).

The bioinformatics analysis of the biosynthetic mechanism for the production of 1 highlighted the importance of exploring the different detection strictness and extra features predicted by antiSMASH. The careful analysis of proposed antiSMASH BGC boundaries could be a valuable aspect in mining biosynthetic gene clusters, rather than merely relying on the default settings. The putative gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 8 encoded in the S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome was identified through a detailed analysis of the BGC proposed by antiSMASH. The identified gene cluster was part of a larger BGC region 16 annotated as “T2PKS” due to its close proximity to signature genes used by antiSMASH as anchor points for the T2PKS gene cluster. The putative carbazomycin B gene cluster in the S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome was found using “relaxed” detection strictness, while the BGC for carbazomycin B in the S. luteoverticillatus CGMCC 15060 and S. diacarni LHW51701T genomes was predicted only by antiSMASH in “loose” detection strictness.

S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T extract induced cell death via membrane damage against the multidrug-resistant S. aureus ATCC BAA-44. The crude extract of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T had an oily consistency with dark brown coloration due to the high pigmented melanin content (55, 56). Initial screening using an absorbance-based assay revealed that the nature of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T extract caused false-positive results and low reproducibility.

The live/dead cell differentiation in a cell population can be easily distinguished using the calcein-propidium iodide (PI) staining (57). Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) is a permeable nonfluorescent molecule that is rapidly hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases in viable cells to green fluorescent calcein, which is subsequently retained intracellularly (58). Alternatively, the nuclei-staining dye PI is a nonpermeable molecule that can only enter a membrane-damaged cell and intercalates with the DNA (59), producing a red fluorescence.

After 6 h of treatment exposure, the live/dead cells were qualitatively identified via fluorescence microscopy. DMSO-treated cells displayed green fluorescence (Fig. 9A), indicating viable cells. On the other hand, cells treated with 70% ethanol and S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T extract (5 mg/mL) showed red fluorescence, indicating nonviable cells.

The cell population density in the flow cytometry profile in Fig. 9B was clustered into two regions based on their physiological status: R1, with PI-labeled cells (dead cells with damaged membranes), and R2, calcein-labeled cells (viable cells with an intact membrane) (23, 60). The DMSO-treated cells showed a high cell population (94.6%) in R2, which was considered live, viable cells. Results showed that S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T extract-treated cells exhibited a high cell population (99.8%) in R1, indicating nonviable cells. The bactericidal activity of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T extract was significantly comparable to that in 70% ethanol, which killed 98.5% of the cell population. These cells were considered dead with damaged membranes, as propidium iodide can only penetrate bacterial cells with compromised membrane permeability or integrity. In this study, 70% ethanol was used as a positive model for cell membrane damage. Ethyl alcohol, at 60 to 80% concentration, is a known disinfecting agent that denatures proteins and disrupts the cell membrane. The loss of cellular membrane integrity results in increased permeability and uncontrolled transport of solutes, decreasing the proton flux across the membrane and cytoplasmic leakage (61–63) leading to cell death.

The bactericidal activity of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T extract at 5 mg/mL was further validated by standard total plate counts to confirm that the membrane-damaged cell population observed in flow cytometry was dead cells. An antibiotic agent is considered “bactericidal” if it can completely prevent bacterial growth or results in a ≥99.9% decrease in the initial inoculum (64).

Minimal growth inhibition was observed against E. faecium, with only 87% growth inhibition at 128 μg/mL, while none of the Gram-negative pathogens was inhibited. Carbazole derivatives have attracted attention due to their wide range of pharmacological applications (65–69), as the carbazole moiety is known to be useful in research and clinical studies (69–73). The compound 1 produced by S. diacarni LHW51701T has a MIC of >128 μg/mL against Bacillus mycoides, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Candida albicans (45).

In addition, compound 1 produced by coral reef sand-derived S. diacarni SCSIO 64983, when tested using the disk-diffusion method at 10 μg, showed no antibacterial activity against Gram-positive or Gram-negative pathogens. Halo- and thio-carbazomycin analogs produced by S. diacarni SCSIO 64983 against the mentioned test pathogens also showed no antibiotic properties (43). The observed antibacterial activities of 1 produced by Streptomyces tubbatahanensis DSD3025T in this study against disease-causing pathogens S. aureus and S. pyogenes showed a propitious result that fills in the gap for antibiotic drug discovery.

Compound 1 demonstrated anticancer activity above the 50% threshold against two cancer cell lines. At 125 μg/mL, 1 showed 55.4% and 50.2% growth inhibition against HCT-116 and A2780 cells, respectively (Fig. 10C). Carbazole derivatives have been gaining interest for their wide range of biological activities (64–66). However, 1 isolated from the sponge-associated bacterium Streptomyces diacarni LHW51701T demonstrated no anticancer activity against the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line SPCA-1 (45). In this study, the antiproliferative activities of 1 produced by Streptomyces tubbatahanensis DSD3025T against HCT-116 and A2780 indicated that the compound had a broader spectrum for targeted cancer cell lines.

The S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T extract showed decreasing toxicity in a dose-dependent manner against kidney, liver, and cardiac cell lines (Fig. 10B). Moreover, 1 showed moderate nephrotoxicity, high cardiotoxicity, and nonhepatotoxicity at 125 μg/mL (Fig. 10D). A low percent toxicity relates to safe levels of a compound suitable for administration toward the target organ. On the other hand, absence of compound toxicity signifies viability of the cells, since elevated LDH levels are associated with cell injury and death.

Advancements in bioinformatics and genomics have improved the ability to analyze key features and core biosynthetic gene clusters of novel genomes. These major developments in natural products research have facilitated the discovery of novel compounds through metabolomics. The discovery of the tryptophan halogenase gene encoded in the novel S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome enabled the identification of halogenated compounds by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry metabolomics demonstrated that S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T produces halogenated metabolites, which could be investigated for their anticancer and antibacterial activity. The halogenated metabolites produced by S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T were less likely attributed to the original tryptophan halogenase harbored in the genome, and this finding led to the focused search for halogenated compounds using metabolomics. The two-component halogenase-reductase system was not involved in the halogenation of carbazole metabolites produced by S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T, but the chlorination step was rather compensated by a putative FDH gene that facilitated the C-4 chlorination of carbazole ring A. The tryptophan halogenase and its associated flavin reductase encoded in the S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T genome may influence the halogen moiety of other tryptophan substrates, and this needs further investigation for the identification of novel specialized metabolites. Future purification and NMR analysis of S. tubbatahanensis DSD3025T extract warrant the profiling, structure elucidation, and identification of the halogenated specialized metabolites as antibacterial and anticancer candidates in the drug discovery pipeline.
