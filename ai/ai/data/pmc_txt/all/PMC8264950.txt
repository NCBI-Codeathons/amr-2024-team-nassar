Conspectus  The genomic era has dramatically changed how we discover and investigate
microbial biochemistry. In particular, the exponential expansion in
the number of sequenced microbial genomes provides investigators with
a vast wealth of sequence data to exploit for the discovery of biochemical
functions and mechanisms, as well as novel enzymes and metabolites.
In contrast to early biochemical work, which was largely characterized
by “forward” approaches that proceed from biomass to
enzyme to gene, the availability of genome sequences enables the discovery
of new microbial metabolic activities, enzymes, and metabolites by
“reverse” approaches that originate with genetic information
or by approaches that incorporate features of both forward and reverse
methodologies. In the genomic era, the canonical organization of microbial
genomes into gene clusters presents a singular opportunity for the
utilization of genomic data. Specifically, genomic context (information
gleaned from the genes surrounding a gene of interest in the chromosome)
is a powerful tool for chemical discovery in microbial systems because
of the functional and/or physiological relationship that usually exists
between genes found within a gene cluster. This means that the investigator
can use this inferred link to generate hypotheses about the functions
of individual genes in the cluster or even the function of the entire
cluster itself. Here, we discuss how analysis of genomic context in
combination with a mechanistic understanding of enzymes can facilitate
numerous facets of microbial biochemical research including the identification
of biosynthetic gene clusters, the discovery of important and novel
enzymes, the elucidation of natural product structures, and the identification
of new metabolic pathways. We highlight work from our laboratory using
genomic context to discover and study biosynthetic pathways that produce
natural products, including the cylindrocyclophanes, nitrogen–nitrogen
bond-containing metabolites, and the gut microbial genotoxin colibactin.
Although use of genomic context is most commonly associated with studies
of natural product biosynthesis, we also show that it can be applied
to the study of primary metabolism. We illustrate this with examples
from our work studying the members of the glycyl radical enzyme superfamily
involved in choline and 4-hydroxyproline degradation in the human
gut. Looking forward, we envision increased opportunities to use such
information, with the combination of biochemical knowledge and computational
tools poised to fuel a new revolution in our ability to connect genes
and their biochemical functions. In particular, we note a need for
methods that computationally formalize the functional association
between genes when such associations are not obvious from manual gene
annotations. Such tools will drastically augment the feasibility and
scope of gene cluster analysis and accelerate the discovery of new
microbial enzymes, metabolites, and metabolic processes. Special Issue Published as part of

metabolic pathways, and metabolites have influenced many branches
of chemistry, informing the study of chemical reactivity,5 providing targets for total and semisynthesis,6 fueling drug development and medicinal chemistry,7 and revealing new tools for biocatalysis and

microbial biochemistry has been transforming
in the genomic era. This period (which begins roughly in the mid 2000s
and proceeds through the present) encompasses a time during which
genomic sequencing has been widely available and, in recent years,
ubiquitous. As of November 2020, over 229,000 permanent draft genomes
and 20,100 complete genomes have been deposited in NCBI and are listed
in the Genomes Online Database (GOLD). The majority of these (62%)
are from bacteria and archaea.9 This bounty
is accompanied by a formidable gap between the number of genes sequenced
and the number for which we can confidently assign a function. Even
in E. coli, there is experimental evidence for the
function for only about two-thirds of the predicted genes.10 In less well characterized organisms, that number
is much lower. For instance, as part of the expanded Human Microbiome
Project, researchers could only functionally annotate 35–45%
of the genes identified.11 This challenge
extends to genes that are critical for life. Of the 473 apparently
essential genes in a “minimal bacterial genome” derived
from the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides, 31.5% had
no known function at the time of publication.12 Clearly, the genomic era has provided vast amounts of data that
have the potential to transform our understanding of microbes and

biochemical discoveries stemmed from a common investigative
approach, regardless of whether the investigator studied microbes
or mammals. One usually found a compound or enzyme of interest by
obtaining biomass, lysing the cells (or collecting the spent media),
and then purifying the active species of interest. When genetic mapping
and manipulation became available, the investigator could use purified
protein to track down the encoding gene and perhaps disrupt or delete
it. Overall, the process was a “forward” one that began
with biomass and ended with a gene. Early

Use Them? What Is a Gene Cluster and Why Do Microorganisms
Use Them? What Is a Gene Cluster and Why Do Microorganisms
Use Them? A gene cluster consists of a syntenic set of genes,
their intervening
noncoding sequences, and adjacent regulatory elements. These genes
are typically functionally related (involved in the same pathway or
process) and may be positively or negatively coregulated. Prokaryotes
are known to cotranscribe sets of gene that are oriented in the same
direction, generating a single molecule of mRNA containing multiple
open reading frames (ORFs). An operon is a stretch of genomic DNA
that serves as a transcriptional template for a multi-ORF mRNA, and
the simplest gene cluster consists of a single operon. Here, all of
the genes in the operon are physiologically tied together by their
cotranscription. However, gene clusters are often larger and more
complex than single operons. For example, the choline utilization
(cut) gene cluster, which allows microbes to use
choline as a source of carbon and energy under anaerobic conditions,
contains multiple apparent operons, all of which are transcribed in
the same direction.4 It is also quite common
to observe gene clusters consisting of two operons that are arranged
“head-to-head”, divergently transcribed from the same
DNA segment. An example of this type of gene cluster is the D. desulfuricans DSM 642 isethionate metabolism gene cluster.13 Regulatory proteins are also often found oriented
for divergent transcription just upstream of an operon.14 Finally, some gene clusters are chaotically
organized, containing functionally related genes in multiple operons
that are divergently transcribed with no apparent pattern. One example
is the cre gene cluster that biosynthesizes cremeomycin
in Streptomyces cremeus (Figure 1B).15 Such gene
clusters are particularly difficult to identify. It is therefore important
to keep in mind the many structural varieties of gene clusters. A gene cluster consists of a syntenic set of genes,

explanations have been proposed. First, this organization mode provides
the opportunity to easily coregulate gene expression.16 Such coregulation would enable coordinated changes in metabolism
and other important phenotypes. This is particularly clear in the
cases of operons, where an entire biochemical pathway is coexpressed
as a single transcriptional unit. Less obviously, the colocalization
of genes may permit the coregulation of separate operons using common
promotor and regulatory sequences.16 Finally,
organization into gene clusters may permit facile horizontal gene
transfer of an entire pathway between different microbes, as compared
to gene-by-gene transfer in separate events.17 Therefore, it is likely that multiple evolutionary driving forces
are responsible for this mode of genomic organization in prokaryotes.

gene cluster (BGC) is a gene cluster that encodes the enzymatic machinery
responsible for the biosynthesis of a natural product or secondary
metabolite. Microbial natural products are an important source of
drugs and other bioactive compounds.7 While
many organisms do not harbor BGCs, they can be quite numerous in certain
microbes. Streptomyces species, for instance, typically

a natural product produced by Streptomyces
alanosinicus ATCC 15710 (Figure 1A).21 It has been
investigated as an antitumor compound but was of interest to us because
of its unusual nitrogen–nitrogen (N–N) bond-containing N-hydroxynitroso (diazeniumdiolate) functional group. We
recently identified the l-alanosine BGC using a structure-guided
approach. Inspection of l-alanosine’s structure suggested
it might originate from l-diaminopropionic acid, a metabolite
known to be made in the staphloferrin B biosynthetic pathway by two
enzymes, SbnA and SbnB.22,23 SbnA uses a pyridoxal
phosphate (PLP) cofactor to convert O-phospho-l-serine into N-(1-amin-1-carboxyl-2-ethyl)-glutamic
acid, which SbnB oxidatively cleaves to l-diaminopropionic
acid.22 Thus, we searched the S.

and SbnB. We identified one candidate (the ala gene
cluster) that encodes the requisite l-diaminopropionic acid
biosynthetic enzymes, along with nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS)

in Streptomyces cremeus (the cre gene cluster) that encoded GriI and GriH homologues, along with
genes later found to be responsible for diazo formation (creDEM). Heterologous expression of the cre gene cluster
verified its connection to cremeomycin biosynthesis.15 Applying structure-guided approaches may be challenging
if natural
products contain structural features that are of unknown origin or
are installed by enzyme classes that participate in many cellular
pathways and processes. A potential alternative strategy leverages
information about the natural product’s biological activity.
For example, it is common for BGCs to encode self-resistance proteins
that protect the producing organism from the natural product.27 In some cases, the self-resistance protein is
an extra, resistant copy of the natural product’s molecular
target (e.g., a BGC that produces an antibiotic targeting topoisomerase
might encode a resistant topoisomerase28). This phenomenon presents the opportunity for resistance-guided
genomic mining strategies. In this approach, knowledge of a natural
product’s target or mechanism of action is used to identify
gene clusters that contain potential resistance genes. Applying structure-guided approaches may be challenging

a resistance-guided genome mining approach to identify
the streptozotocin BGC (Figure 2). Streptozotocin is a N-nitrososourea-containing
natural product that is used as a chemotherapeutic for treatment of
pancreatic and gastrointestinal cancers.29 Because streptozotocin is a DNA methylating agent, we searched the

the szn gene cluster, which encodes homologues of
the DNA alkylation repair enzymes AlkB and AGT.1 Characterizing the encoded streptozotocin biosynthetic

a structure-guided strategy, we identified the cyl gene cluster, which produces cylindrocyclophanes A–F (Figure 3).2 Annotation of the gene cluster revealed no obvious candidate
enzyme(s) responsible for paracyclophane assembly, but genomic context

that could not be assigned an obvious biosynthetic role, narrowing
the candidates for macrocycle assembly (Figure 3A). Analyses of additional BGCs progressively
simplified the outlook. We identified CylC homologues encoded in several
BGCs that produce chlorinated natural products but lack homologues
of characterized halogenases.32 This suggested
that that CylC was a new type of halogenase that activated a monomeric
precursor for subsequent alkylation. Indeed, recombinant CylC chlorinates
an early biosynthetic intermediate that is elaborated to a chlorinated
alkylresorcinol precursor (Figure 3B).32 We employed this strategy in studies

as to which enzyme catalyzed paracyclophane

potential use of a secondary alkyl chloride substrate, which is typically
a poor electrophile, was particularly striking as there was no biological

that is a close homologue of both XcnG and ZmaM,33 as well as a homologous initiating NRPS module (ClbN) predicted
to assemble the N-acyl-d-asparagine prodrug
motif. This led us to hypothesize that related biosynthetic logic
might be used in colibactin assembly. We began by confirming in vitro that ClbN generated an N-acyl-d-asparagine motif, identifying myristoyl-CoA as a preferred

colibactin’s mode of action. Specifically, the unexpected discovery
of cyclopropane rings in metabolites isolated from clbP mutants suggested that colibactin was a DNA alkylating agent. This
hypothesis guided efforts to identify and characterize the products
of colibactin-mediated DNA damage. The initial characterization of
two colibactin-derived DNA adducts revealed alkylation of adenine
by an activated, cyclopropane electrophilic “warhead”
generated by removal of the N-acyl-d-asparagine
residue by ClbP. This DNA alkylating activity was potentially consistent
with reports that colibactin producing E. coli form
DNA interstrand cross-links. However, this activity could not be rationalized
from the structural information available at the time. Our investigation
of the final uncharacterized gene in the clb gene

that ClbL links two biosynthetic intermediates together via amide
bond formation to generate a pseudodimeric precolibactin containing
two N-acyl-d-asparagine motifs. Cleavage

our discovery of primary metabolic enzymes involved in anaerobic microbial
choline metabolism (Figure 5A). Choline is a dietary nutrient that is metabolized to trimethylamine
(TMA) by anaerobic bacteria, including inhabitants of the human gut.9,48 In the past decade TMA production by the gut microbiota has been
linked to a variety of diseases including nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes,

identified the microbial enzyme responsible for TMA production from
choline.4 We started with the previous
observation that acetaldehyde was an intermediate in choline catabolism.
This suggested a redox-neutral lyase activity that eliminated TMA.
A similar reaction occurs during the catabolism of ethanolamine by E. coli and other organisms. In this case, an adenosylcobalamin-dependent
enzyme, ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, catalyzes the elimination of ammonia
from ethanolamine through a radical mechanism, thereby generating
acetaldehyde. This volatile, reactive intermediate is generated and
sequestered within a protein-based organelle called a bacterial microcompartment.51 We leveraged genomic context in

that the enzyme responsible for liberating TMA from choline would
be encoded together with homologues of proteins involved in ethanolamine

the cut gene cluster lacked a gene encoding a homologue

next to a gene encoding a homologue of pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase
(P5CR) (Figure 5B).
P5CR reduces pyrroline 5-carboxylate to proline, and this context

for anaerobic bacterial catabolism,54 where
it serves as an electron acceptor during fermentation, undergoing
reduction to 5-aminovalerate. This metabolism was known to occur in Clostridium sporogenes and C. difficile.54,55 Previous evidence suggested that proline
was an intermediate in Hyp metabolism,55 but the enzyme(s) responsible for this conversion were unknown.

Where does the community go from here? One particularly challenging
problem is elucidating the functions of numerous totally uncharacterized
gene clusters present in sequenced microbial genomes. Cryptic natural
product BGCs are often easier to approach, both because of their presumed
role in natural product assembly and because related BGCs have often
been studied. Outside of natural product biosynthesis, uncovering
the functions of uncharacterized gene clusters is a formidable challenge.
Here, we discuss some of the difficulties in characterizing such gene

Here, we discuss some of the difficulties in characterizing such gene
clusters and highlight potential strategies to overcome this problem. First, the investigator usually requires a “foot in the
door”—some pre-existing data that links an uncharacterized
gene cluster to a metabolic or biological function. These data can
take a variety of forms, including the phenotype of an overexpression
or deletion mutant, native expression patterns, and homology of genes
in the gene cluster to genes of known function. For most gene clusters,
these data do not exist or are difficult to interpret. For instance,
one might find conditions under which a gene cluster is expressed
but be unable to link that gene cluster to a phenotypic effect. Second,
with so many gene clusters available to investigate, one must prioritize
specific gene clusters for characterization. First, the investigator usually requires a “foot in the

context can address both of these problems.
Analyzing a gene cluster can reveal whether surrounding genes fall
into the same (or related) COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Genes) in
similar gene clusters. If the gene cluster is found in more than one
organism, this could indicate a shared or closely related function.
Thus, the investigator may use what we term “pan-genomic context”,
the sum of the genomic contexts for each instance of a gene cluster.
Pan-genomic context can provide important clues about function. For
instance, in some organisms a gene of interest might have no suggestive
genomic context, but in others, it might be colocalized with genes
involved in a characterized metabolic process. This could suggest
a plausible role in that process in both organisms. Genomic context
can also help to prioritize of uncharacterized gene clusters for further
study, for example, by allowing researchers to focus on genomic regions
containing uncharacterized members of an enzyme family of interest. Analysis of genomic
context can address both of these problems.

of future work in microbial chemistry, significant challenges remain
to be addressed. In particular, one commonly finds that a gene of
interest is surrounded by genes with only a family or “domain
of unknown function” (DUF) assignment. At first glance, such
annotations are of little help. But these nonspecific or even ambiguous
annotations represent a new protein family to discover, and linking
such gene clusters to microbial activities can provide a path forward
for characterization. While the analysis of genomic context is indubitably a key component

the genomic placement of a gene and its plausible role. To exploit
the full potential of genomic context, we should integrate computational

and metabolomics will make the functional delineation of uncharacterized
microbial gene clusters substantially easier in the coming decades.
To further accelerate this process, it is critical to improve our
ability to leverage the information inherent in genomic context, with
biochemists and chemical biologists playing a central role in prioritizing
exciting targets for discovery and incorporating biochemical knowledge
into computational approaches. We envision chemical knowledge and
approaches being critical in transitioning from a genomic to a functional
era in microbial biology. It is clear
