Antibiotic development based on natural products has faced a long lasting decline since the 1970s, while both the speed and the extent of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) development have been severely underestimated. The discovery of antimicrobial natural products of bacterial and fungal origin featuring new chemistry and previously unknown mode of actions is increasingly challenged by rediscovery issues. Natural products that are abundantly produced by the corresponding wild type organisms often featuring strong UV signals have been extensively characterized, especially the ones produced by extensively screened microbial genera such as streptomycetes. Purely synthetic chemistry approaches aiming to replace the declining supply from natural products as starting materials to develop novel antibiotics largely failed to provide significant numbers of antibiotic drug leads. To cope with this fundamental issue, microbial natural products science is being transformed from a ‘grind-and-find’ study to an integrated approach based on bacterial genomics and metabolomics. Novel technologies in instrumental analytics are increasingly employed to lower detection limits and expand the space of detectable substance classes, while broadening the scope of accessible and potentially bioactive natural products. Furthermore, the almost exponential increase in publicly available bacterial genome data has shown that the biosynthetic potential of the investigated strains by far exceeds the amount of detected metabolites. This can be judged by the discrepancy between the number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) encoded in the genome of each microbial strain and the number of secondary metabolites actually detected, even when considering the increased sensitivity provided by novel analytical instrumentation. In silico annotation tools for biosynthetic gene cluster classification and analysis allow fast prioritization in BGC-to-compound workflows, which is highly important to be able to process the enormous underlying data volumes. BGC prioritization is currently accompanied by novel molecular biology-based approaches to access the so-called orphan BGCs not yet correlated with a secondary metabolite. Integration of metabolomics, in silico genomics and molecular biology approaches into the mainstream of natural product research will critically influence future success and impact the natural product field in pharmaceutical, nutritional and agrochemical applications and especially in anti-infective research. Antimicrobial resistance is a major public concern and novel antibiotics are largely based on natural products. We summarize recent analytical and genome based technological developments that gain increasing importance in the natural products field. Introduction Introduction Antibiotics research has come a long way since the discoveries of first penicillin and later streptomycin in the 30s and 40s of the last century.1 These discoveries marked the start of the so-called golden era of antibiotics by introducing antimicrobial substances that would become some of the most successful small molecule drugs in human history.1,2 The golden era of antibiotics discovery lasted from the 1930s until the 1960s, a time that saw numerous discoveries and rapid development of novel antibiotic substances.3 Most of the antibiotic drugs developed early on, such as aminoglycosides or tetracyclines were derived from actinomycetes and were provided by so-called bioactivity-guided antibiotics isolation approaches.4 The development of sulfonamides was an exception at that time, as they represent purely synthetic antibacterial agents.5 Natural products are preselected structures in the search for drug leads in antibiotics research as they are produced by the respective microbes or plants to defend themselves against predators or competitors in their ecological niches.6 Even though plants have been used for the longest time for medicinal purposes among the natural product producers, fungi and bacteria are more suitable when it comes to antibiotics discovery, as survival in their microbial community forces them to compete with other microbes and defence against higher developed animals is assumed less important.7 Antibiotics research has come a long way since the discoveries of first penicillin and later streptomycin in the 30s and 40s of the last century.1 These discoveries marked the start of the so-called golden era of antibiotics by introducing antimicrobial substances that would become some of the most successful small molecule drugs in human history.1,2 The golden era of antibiotics discovery lasted from the 1930s until the 1960s, a time that saw numerous discoveries and rapid development of novel antibiotic substances.3 Most of the antibiotic drugs developed early on, such as aminoglycosides or tetracyclines were derived from actinomycetes and were provided by so-called bioactivity-guided antibiotics isolation approaches.4 The development of sulfonamides was an exception at that time, as they represent purely synthetic antibacterial agents.5 Natural products are preselected structures in the search for drug leads in antibiotics research as they are produced by the respective microbes or plants to defend themselves against predators or competitors in their ecological niches.6 Even though plants have been used for the longest time for medicinal purposes among the natural product producers, fungi and bacteria are more suitable when it comes to antibiotics discovery, as survival in their microbial community forces them to compete with other microbes and defence against higher developed animals is assumed less important.7 Not long after the antibiotic discovery boom, the general sentiment that bacterial infections are generally under control emerged among both natural product scientists as well as pharmacists and clinicians (see Fig. 1). Infectious diseases were no longer considered to rank among the biggest health risks to humans, which inevitably led to shifting priorities towards other topics such as anti-cancer research.8,9 However, bacterial and fungal pathogens adapted much more quickly than predicted to the more and more widespread use of antibiotics by developing and sharing antibiotic resistance genes, which is why infectious diseases are seen as one of the major global health threats again.10 Not long after the antibiotic discovery boom, the general sentiment that bacterial infections are generally under control emerged among both natural product scientists as well as pharmacists and clinicians (see Fig. 1).

To date, most infectious diseases caused by bacteria remain controllable due to semisynthetic improvement of clinically used antibiotics derived from natural products in several iterations.12,13 Many antibiotic classes, especially the ones discovered early on during the golden age of antibiotics have already reached the 5th generation of synthetic derivatives, limiting further chemical modifications.13 The increasing number of antibiotics resistance adaptation cycles followed by semisynthetic optimization aimed at breaking this pathogen resistance development leaves many well-known antibiotics without much room for synthetic improvement. There have been significant efforts to tackle this challenge with de novo synthesized small molecules based on the molecular understanding of bacterial growth and metabolism in the pharmaceutical industry, but the antibiotic drug lead output did not warrant the investment costs.14 Therefore, the combination of scientific difficulties associated with antibiotic discovery and development, as well as a number of economic challenges related to antibiotics marketing, led to most big pharmaceutical companies leaving this research field.15 To date, most infectious diseases caused by bacteria remain controllable due to semisynthetic improvement of clinically used antibiotics derived from natural products in several iterations.12,13 Many antibiotic classes, especially the ones discovered early on during the golden age of antibiotics have already reached the 5th generation of synthetic derivatives, limiting further chemical modifications.13 The increasing number of antibiotics resistance adaptation cycles followed by semisynthetic optimization aimed at breaking this pathogen resistance development leaves many well-known antibiotics without much room for synthetic improvement.

Thus, current research has to refocus on isolation, cultivation and analysis of lesser-investigated bacterial and fungal species, as these have higher chances of producing novel natural products.16 For such bacterial strains, it is thought that the majority of the produced natural products are not described yet. Since the golden age of antibiotics, many new microbial strains as potential producers of novel secondary metabolites have been isolated, which greatly expands the taxonomical diversity available in the laboratory. Furthermore, most of the already investigated strains have only been used to isolate a single natural product class. However, according to in silico predictions almost all of them are capable of producing many more than just single natural products classes, leaving a huge chemical space still untapped.17 Furthermore, metagenomics analyses suggest that the majority of microorganisms have not been cultivated in laboratory environments yet.18 Additionally, there is a strong need to implement improved analytics systems or a wider variety of different detection techniques to explore the metabolites that are difficult to detect.19 That way, metabolites displaying irregular polarity or ionization properties can be accessed as well as metabolites produced in low amounts. The ability of the natural products discovery field to adapt to this new situation and extract value out of what is commonly referred to as the ‘hidden metabolome’ of bacteria will ultimately determine the future role of bacterial natural product research, not only in antibiotics discovery.

The analytical challenge: untargeted bacterial secondary metabolomics, efficient data mining and prioritization The analytical challenge: untargeted bacterial secondary metabolomics, efficient data mining and prioritization Natural products scientists have always dealt with extracts from natural sources as a means to find novel biologically active molecules. These extracts are complex mixtures of primary and secondary metabolites of the extracted organism, whose components stretch all across the polarity spectrum and comprise a significant range in molecular mass.20 In microbial natural product research, these extracts additionally contain complex matrices composed of co-extracted components stemming from cultivation media or additives that may lead to UV and MS signals with orders of magnitude more intense than the analytes of interest. The analysis of these extracts has always been inherently challenging and no single analysis method will be able to separate and annotate its entire content.21 Natural products scientists have always dealt with extracts from natural sources as a means to find novel biologically active molecules.

The respective methods and instrumentations were developed to overcome these obstacles in non-targeted metabolomics workflows focusing on expanding the range of detectable metabolites. Compounds that are detected and isolated in non-targeted metabolomics or via in silico genomics and molecular biology-based campaigns for antibiotics discovery are often tested for in vitro bioactivity against a variety of pathogens or pathogen-like organisms and evaluated for their primary cytotoxicity in parallel.9 Unfortunately, after confirming bioactivity in an untargeted metabolomics workflow, it is often difficult to elucidate the mode of action and molecular target of these newly found antibiotics. In targeted metabolomics workflows, which aim to identify antibiotics with a specific target, the methods mainly aim at improving the detectability of the compound to protein interactions for example, as well as the incorporation of a more diverse set of analytical methods.19 Target-based metabolomics workflows or those relying on a functional assay, limit the detectable natural products to specific binders showing activity in said assay and are therefore a step ahead in the process of developing a natural product-based antibiotic. However, as already mentioned above, these techniques are limited to known molecular targets, wherefore the application of non-targeted metabolomics workflows are still of high importance.

Analytical setups for extract analysis Analytical setups for extract analysis Analytical setups for extract analysis Current MS-based secondary metabolomics analysis mainly focuses on liquid chromatography electrospray ionization (LC-ESI) MS-based techniques.22 While these techniques offer a very broad detection coverage of natural products scaffolds combined with a relative ease of use and cost efficiency, there are a variety of natural products classes that are difficult-to-impossible to detect due to polarity or ionization constraints.17 Detectability problems may arise in each step of this process, wherefore we present alternatives for LC, ESI and MS in the following sections. During the LC process, extremely polar and water-soluble substances such as the nucleoside antibiotic pseudouridimycin portray almost no retention in reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), whereas strongly nonpolar substances such as terpenes show too much affinity to an RP-HPLC column and may not be eluted from the column in a standardized gradient.25 Furthermore, common eluents used for LC include a small amount of organic acids to increase separation and subsequent ionization with ESI, which may degrade acid-sensitive natural products. Natural products not detectable due to incompatibility with the LC system may, however, be detectable when directly infusing the bacterial crude extracts, without prior separation by LC, which becomes feasible by increasing the resolving power of the mass spectrometer.21 Current MS-based secondary metabolomics analysis mainly focuses on liquid chromatography electrospray ionization (LC-ESI) MS-based techniques.22 While these techniques offer a very broad detection coverage of natural products scaffolds combined with a relative ease of use and cost efficiency, there are a variety of natural products classes that are difficult-to-impossible to detect due to polarity or ionization constraints.17 Detectability problems may arise in each step of this process, wherefore we present alternatives for LC, ESI and MS in the following sections.

This issue can be tackled when introducing NMR to metabolomics workflows, either as an alternative to or as hyphenation with MS.19 In order to broaden the natural products space and to facilitate the detection of novel antibiotics from the bacterial origin, we have to diversify analytical techniques for both natural product separation and detection (see Fig. 3).

DI-Fourier transform mass spectrometry in secondary metabolomics DI-Fourier transform mass spectrometry in secondary metabolomics DI-Fourier transform mass spectrometry in secondary metabolomics One of the mass spectrometry techniques emerging in recent years, which is increasingly integrating into the mainstream of analytics procedures for bacterial secondary metabolite analysis, is direct infusion (DI) mass spectrometry on ultrahigh resolution (UHR) mass spectrometers such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) and Orbitrap mass spectrometers.28 This technique can be an excellent addition to LC-MS based bacterial secondary metabolite discovery, as it removes the polarity constraints imposed by LC-columns.21 One of the mass spectrometry techniques emerging in recent years, which is increasingly integrating into the mainstream of analytics procedures for bacterial secondary metabolite analysis, is direct infusion (DI) mass spectrometry on ultrahigh resolution (UHR) mass spectrometers such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) and Orbitrap mass spectrometers.28 This technique can be an excellent addition to LC-MS based bacterial secondary metabolite discovery, as it removes the polarity constraints imposed by LC-columns.21 One of the mass spectrometry techniques emerging in recent years, which is increasingly integrating into the mainstream of analytics procedures for bacterial secondary metabolite analysis, is direct infusion (DI) mass spectrometry on ultrahigh resolution (UHR) mass spectrometers such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) and Orbitrap mass spectrometers.28 This technique can be an excellent addition to LC-MS based bacterial secondary metabolite discovery, as it removes the polarity constraints imposed by LC-columns.21 Plant derived secondary metabolomics have successfully applied DI-FTICR as an add-on to LC-MS based secondary metabolomics approaches as exemplified by Park et al.29 However, for bacterial secondary metabolomics DI Fourier transform-based MS is only rarely used, even though it was shown to extend the chemical space detectable in natural product extracts.21 While there are studies that successfully employed FTICR data to unravel interactions between organisms of different kingdoms of life, such as the interaction of Rhizoctonia strains with Solanum tuberosum or the interaction between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Caenorhabditis elegans, the technique remains underused as a screening tool to overcome the LC-ESI-MS detectability bias.30 Plant derived secondary metabolomics have successfully applied DI-FTICR as an add-on to LC-MS based secondary metabolomics approaches as exemplified by Park et al.29 However, for bacterial secondary metabolomics DI Fourier transform-based MS is only rarely used, even though it was shown to extend the chemical space detectable in natural product extracts.21 While there are studies that successfully employed FTICR data to unravel interactions between organisms of different kingdoms of life, such as the interaction of Rhizoctonia strains with Solanum tuberosum or the interaction between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Caenorhabditis elegans, the technique remains underused as a screening tool to overcome the LC-ESI-MS detectability bias.30 Plant derived secondary metabolomics have successfully applied DI-FTICR as an add-on to LC-MS based secondary metabolomics approaches as exemplified by Park et al.29 However, for bacterial secondary metabolomics DI Fourier transform-based MS is only rarely used, even though it was shown to extend the chemical space detectable in natural product extracts.21 While there are studies that successfully employed FTICR data to unravel interactions between organisms of different kingdoms of life, such as the interaction of Rhizoctonia strains with Solanum tuberosum or the interaction between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Caenorhabditis elegans, the technique remains underused as a screening tool to overcome the LC-ESI-MS detectability bias.30 While FTICR has proven to be slightly advantageous when it comes to determination of molecular formulae from complex mixtures in a direct comparison with Orbitrap MS, its high costs and the extensive expertise required for operation strongly limit its application.31 Orbitrap MS, which became available around 2004 as an affordable alternative, may therefore increasingly be used for DI Fourier transform-based natural product discovery in the future. Both FTICR and Orbitrap technologies often unambiguously provide the molecular composition of an ionized molecule based on mass accuracy and the isotopic fine structure. Additionally, they may be used in MSn experiments to provide further insights into the structural composition. They both however lack any additional structural information as for example polarity and the surface as assessed by LC and IMS.

Ion separation according to collision cross-section – ion mobility spectrometry in natural product research Ion separation according to collision cross-section – ion mobility spectrometry in natural product research Ion separation according to collision cross-section – ion mobility spectrometry in natural product research The development of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) coupled MS systems that became commercially available and thus increasingly available to natural products laboratories already started in 1998.32 The big advantage in coupling IMS to MS relies on the separation principle behind ion mobility. Ion mobility cells separate ions in an electric field set in opposing direction to a stream of collision gas molecules, mainly nitrogen gas. In this arrangement, ions are separated according to a collision cross section (CCS) per charge parameter, which is semi-orthogonal to m/z values and thus offers an additional ion separation dimension. For that reason, IMS applications have been developed by several suppliers of MS systems including the travelling wave systems commercialized by Waters, drift tube systems commercialized by Agilent and trapped ion systems commercialized by Bruker. These IMS systems are linked to high-resolution TOF systems and achieve high resolving power due to combined acquisition of CCS and m/z values. These latest developments shifted IMS-MS applications from a niche application for specialized applications to a technique that becomes more and more mainstream in natural products laboratories.33 The key strength of IMS-MS lies in its ability to discern structural isomers that often occur in natural products mixtures, as most structure isomers have different CCS values due to their different geometry. A prominent example for such a case is the detection of streptorubin B from S. coelicolor.34 The utility of IMS-MS as a screening tool was further demonstrated by the principal component analysis based comparison of Nocardiopsis sp. mutants that revealed the effect of antibiotic resistance on secondary metabolite production.35 The development of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) coupled MS systems that became commercially available and thus increasingly available to natural products laboratories already started in 1998.32 The big advantage in coupling IMS to MS relies on the separation principle behind ion mobility. Ion mobility cells separate ions in an electric field set in opposing direction to a stream of collision gas molecules, mainly nitrogen gas. In this arrangement, ions are separated according to a collision cross section (CCS) per charge parameter, which is semi-orthogonal to m/z values and thus offers an additional ion separation dimension. For that reason, IMS applications have been developed by several suppliers of MS systems including the travelling wave systems commercialized by Waters, drift tube systems commercialized by Agilent and trapped ion systems commercialized by Bruker.

It allows, for example, pinpointing secondary metabolites linked to bacterial life cycle stages such as sporulation as it was shown for the myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus.43 Co-cultivation experiments followed up by MALDI-MSI with termite gut-associated Streptomyces strains and a Pleosporales fungus showed spatially resolved appearance of a novel lanthipeptide that only appears in the co-cultivation contact zone.44 These secondary metabolites appearing in the contact zone of a co-cultivation experiment are of particular interest as these molecules are often secreted as defence secondary metabolites that are predestined to become initial lead structures in antibiotics development. Another example for employing MALDI-MSI as a means to discover and isolate novel antibiotics is the discovery of arylomycin from Streptomyces roseosporus.45 In this case, the MS signals stemming from arylomycin were shown to be linked to the growth inhibition zone that made the arylomycin antibiotics visible by MALDI-MSI.

To overcome ionizability limitations arising from ionization via MALDI, a technique to combine the advantages of ESI and MSI was developed. This technique, which is called desorptive electrospray ionization (DESI) uses an ESI spray to perform desorptive ionization from surfaces, which enables an ESI based MSI.47 As described by Parrot et al. DESI-MSI is more readily able to ionize compounds of higher polarity than MALDI-MSI that more predominantly ionizes lipid type metabolites and is therefore more tailored towards the detection of most secondary metabolite classes.47 Still, while the potential of DESI-MSI has been shown in the MSI based analysis of clinical samples especially when combined with metabolite annotation platforms such as METASPACE, so far the technique seems to be widely underused in the natural products discovery process.48 A study that involves future utility of DESI-MSI for natural product research shows antibiotics production during predation by Myxococcus xanthus bacteria.49 Although the study pinpoints a number of molecular features belonging to natural products associated with bacterial predation, isolation of those compounds remains a very challenging task due to the limited scalability of 2D cultivations on surfaces.

Furthermore, strongly active natural products produced by a variety of producer organisms reoccur in these screenings. As a number of the identified small molecule binders show overlapping binding sites, problems with cross-resistance may limit the effectiveness of the approach.70 Molecular target-based approaches furthermore require the purified target structure to be physically available. Because protein expressions are often straightforward, most of these approaches tend to involve protein targets in these experiments.71 The protein is subsequently incubated with bacterial extracts or purified compounds from libraries and potential binders are analysed and subsequently confirmed by diverse analytical techniques. To the best of our knowledge, native protein MS is the only detection method used for high-throughput screening of extracts, whereas methods such as co-crystallization X-ray crystallography, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or microscale thermophoresis (MST) are mainly used for screening of pre-purified extract fractions or libraries of purified natural products.72–74 The following sections summarize how these technologies are implemented in screening workflows for novel antimicrobials.

The ability to determine the exact mass of multi-charged protein complexes in their native form led to development of high throughput binding assays using these protein complexes.

Increased access to hrMS platforms may encourage further spread of this technique in the field of natural product research. A more specialized case in the protein based inhibitor fishing is the detection and analysis of covalently bound protein inhibitors. While these proteins have to be in their active native folding state during binding of the corresponding inhibitor, they will not lose the inhibitor upon denaturing, as it would be the case for non-covalently bound protein inhibitors. Inhibitor screens can therefore be performed by LC-MS under denaturing conditions. An example for the usage of LC-MS based identification of a covalently bound inhibitor to an – in this case – digested protein is the evaluation of thioredoxin inhibition by suicide inhibitors.77 Intact protein LC-MS analysis as a means to identify covalent inhibitors is exemplified by the work on blocking the biosynthesis of the microbial pathogenicity factor Tillivalin by molecules binding covalently to the acyl carrier protein involved in Tillivalin biosynthesis.78 Besides determining whether the inhibitor is binding or not, this approach also allows (with the help of deconvolution software) determining the inhibitor's exact mass from the mass deviation of the protein complexes.73 Native protein MS therefore is well suited for screening complex mixtures such as crude extracts, as it does not only show whether protein binding occurs, but also indicates which component of the mixture did bind to the protein of interest.73 While Yang et al. successfully applied this technique for the identification of an anti-malarial agent out of natural products extracts, access to and application of this technique have been so far limited.76 Despite its tremendous potential in molecular target-directed natural product discovery, native protein MS therefore remains a niche research field.

Recent improvements in resolution towards low, single-digit angstrom values on one hand allows this technique to be harnessed in structure elucidation of enzyme–inhibitor complexes.80 On the other hand, if the target to analyse is crystallizing well, target-directed secondary metabolite discovery by X-ray crystallography is becoming more and more popular.81 Still, the majority of natural product research laboratories neither have direct access to cryo-EM platforms nor to X-ray crystal structure analysis platforms, which makes better implementation of these techniques in natural product research a challenge to be solved in inter-laboratorial cooperation.

In summary, new instrumentation and analysis techniques are available that have already shown to be useable for antibiotic natural product discovery and prioritization for isolation based on a specific protein target. Major improvements have been achieved in the field of mass spectrometry, which influenced many of the non-targeted and targeted metabolomics workflows.

The biosynthetic genomics challenge: prediction and prioritization of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters The biosynthetic genomics challenge: prediction and prioritization of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters Natural product research has undergone a revolution, triggered by the dramatic drop in the genome sequencing cost as well as the increased reliability of modern genome sequencing techniques.84 This allowed the evolution of natural product science from a research field mainly extracting microbial cultures and performing bio testing in so-called ‘grind-and-find’ approaches towards a research field guided by predicting the theoretical secondary metabolite production potential based on genomic information.85 For the first time, researchers were able to increase the chances for identifying novel secondary metabolite structures by specifically looking at microbial species that exhibit a large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways encoded in their genomes. Even the established, most proficient producers turned out to harbour a much larger biosynthetic potential per genome than anticipated by the number of compounds isolated from these strains.17 Natural product research has undergone a revolution, triggered by the dramatic drop in the genome sequencing cost as well as the increased reliability of modern genome sequencing techniques.84 This allowed the evolution of natural product science from a research field mainly extracting microbial cultures and performing bio testing in so-called ‘grind-and-find’ approaches towards a research field guided by predicting the theoretical secondary metabolite production potential based on genomic information.85 For the first time, researchers were able to increase the chances for identifying novel secondary metabolite structures by specifically looking at microbial species that exhibit a large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways encoded in their genomes. Even the established, most proficient producers turned out to harbour a much larger biosynthetic potential per genome than anticipated by the number of compounds isolated from these strains.17 Shortly after the genome sequencing revolution, a variety of bioinformatics tools were developed that allow fast and efficient prediction and annotation of biosynthetic genes. This particularly holds true for bacteria, where secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways are mostly clustered as so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Tools, such as antiSMASH or PRISM, not only allow prediction of a BGC's location, but nowadays also provide first insights into the putative structure of the encoded secondary metabolite.86 BGC annotation principles have been transferred to other organisms such as fungi and even plants, although BGC prediction in these organisms still lags behind the predictive quality reached in bacteria.87 In addition to the genomic analysis of cultured species, the detectability of BGCs in complex environmental metagenome DNA samples is of special interest for bacteria that so far are not cultivatable in laboratories, an aspect that will be discussed in more detail below.

The advances in this field led to a dramatic uptick in the number of detected BGCs across all bacterial genera coupled with information about microbial genera that contain gene cluster-rich genomes.88,89 These so-called BGC-rich genomes cluster among several ‘highly productive’ microbial phyla all across the tree of life.88 However, a significant proportion of BGCs are recurring among bacteria, especially among closely related strains, which makes efficient BGC dereplication a necessity. Community-curated open access repositories such as MiBiG are extremely helpful tools to prevent natural product rediscoveries stemming from the distribution of the same biosynthetic gene cluster across several microbes.90 Even though there is a clear trend that secondary metabolite BGC distribution follows taxonomy, there can be exceptions to this rule. Horizontal gene transfer events for entire BGCs may lead to rediscoveries of natural products from phylogenetically distant bacteria. BGC databases like the aforementioned MiBiG can prevent repetition of work that has already been performed and thus streamline natural product research.91 The advances in this field led to a dramatic uptick in the number of detected BGCs across all bacterial genera coupled with information about microbial genera that contain gene cluster-rich genomes.88,89 These so-called BGC-rich genomes cluster among several ‘highly productive’ microbial phyla all across the tree of life.88 However, a significant proportion of BGCs are recurring among bacteria, especially among closely related strains, which makes efficient BGC dereplication a necessity.

For most bacteria, the number of detected ‘orphan’ BGCs exceeds the number of BGCs correlated with a known natural product.17 An orphan gene cluster in this context means that the genetic data combined with BGC annotation tools clearly show the presence of this BGC in the host strains genome, while no corresponding secondary metabolite can be associated with the applied instrumental analytics and under the cultivation conditions tested.92 Even for bacterial reference stains such as Streptomyces coelicolor A3 (2) or Streptomyces albus J1074, bacterial strains that have been known for a long time and extensively analysed, the BGC content exceeds the number of known secondary metabolites by far.93 Outside of the realm of actinobacteria, the discrepancy between genome inscribed secondary metabolite potential and secondary metabolites actually detected remains equally high, as exemplified by the myxobacterial model strain Myxococcus xanthus DK1622.94 A study on Streptomyces griseus describes in detail how such biosynthetic potential based mining approaches can lead to the discovery of novel natural products by selection of ‘high biosynthetic potential strains’ that are subsequently investigated in depth.95 These examples show that even well-known and extensively used bacterial strains still have enormous biosynthetic potential that has not been harnessed yet. How genomics data can be linked to MS data at an early stage to correlate these orphan gene clusters to their corresponding products which leads to integration of genomics and metabolomics data at an early point in the analysis will be discussed in the following sections in detail.

In antibiotics research based on bacterial secondary metabolomics, mining of self-resistance markers in close proximity to said BGCs has shown great success in uncovering bioactive natural products. Self-resistance is important for antibiotics producing microorganisms, as these microorganisms have to develop means to survive their own antibiotic production.101 Thus, co-localization of an ‘orphan’ BGC with a potential resistance gene indicates the formation of a novel natural product with antibiotic activities.101 Identification, isolation and structure elucidation of pyxidicyclines from myxobacteria, and taromycin from terrestrial, as well as thiotetronic acid from marine actinomycetes are prime examples of how potential self-resistance mechanisms can be harnessed to predict and identify the target of the small molecule product of an ‘orphan’ BGC.102,103 In antibiotics research based on bacterial secondary metabolomics, mining of self-resistance markers in close proximity to said BGCs has shown great success in uncovering bioactive natural products.

This is commonly performed by exchange of the wild type promoter(s), controlling the BGC expression, against inducible promoters that will transcriptionally activate the BGC and remove it from its native regulatory network on the DNA level.107 This can be achieved either by homologous recombination in the producer strain as in the case of pyxidicyclines or by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system as performed in the case of the Streptomyces viridochromogenes pigment.102,108 Applicability of this method critically relies on the availability of genetic tools, including DNA transfer technologies for the corresponding strain, which can be very laborious to develop. It is possibly for this reason that self-resistance based prioritization and activation of BGCs have not been attempted in high-throughput and therefore not delivered an extensive amount of novel bioactive natural products.

An alternative strategy to remove a BGC from the regulatory network in the corresponding wild type organism is to delete BGC-specific repressors or overexpress BGC-specific transcriptional activators. These BGC-specific regulators are often co-localized with the BGC, especially in actinomycetes.109 Overexpression of positive regulators can lead to production of natural products as it was shown for Aspergillus species.110 In streptomycetes, knockout experiments of repressors close to BGCs have shown to be a valuable tool in the activation of ‘cryptic’ natural products.111 These principles can be expanded to other microorganisms to increase the accessible natural product space by activating ‘cryptic’ BGCs.

Cloning and heterologous expression of BGCs Cloning and heterologous expression of BGCs Cloning and heterologous expression of BGCs For many wild type bacteria, genetic engineering tools do not exist, which hinders direct activation of an orphan BGC in said organisms. Therefore, there has been a drive to develop techniques to clone BGCs onto target vectors followed by heterologous expression in well-characterized model strains, which are ideally phylogenetically closely related to the organism of origin of the corresponding BGC. The only way to clone and engineer the biosynthetic machinery of this BGC, in order to activate the production of the corresponding natural product, is extracting the BGC sequence and refactoring it on a genetic element (mainly done in E. coli) followed by transfer of the refactored or activated BGC in a production strain of choice. As this heterologous expression process is time intensive, heterologous expression of interesting cryptic BGCs is preceded by screening the strains' metabolome and genome with large natural products and gene cluster databases such as NPAtlas and MiBiG.90,112 This process limits the number of heterologous expression efforts that result in rediscoveries of previously described natural products.

Techniques that have been successfully used to transfer BGCs from the native host organism to a more easily handled model organism include Rec/ET-based direct cloning, transformation-associated recombination (TAR)-based direct cloning, assembly of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products by TAR, Golden gate cloning or Gibson assembly.96,113,114 These techniques will become even more important with the increased availability of cheap synthetic DNA that is more and more used as an alternative source for assembly of putative antibiotics BGCs (Fig. 5). Recent examples of such heterologous expressions are cloning and heterologous expression of argyrins, kocurin, daptomycin, corallopyronins or pyxidicyclines.102,115 Taken together these techniques can help overcome accessibility limitations that arise from slow or insufficient growth of the wild type organism, a lack of genetic tools to access its cryptic BGCs and yield limitations in the wild type strain.116 Techniques that have been successfully used to transfer BGCs from the native host organism to a more easily handled model organism include Rec/ET-based direct cloning, transformation-associated recombination (TAR)-based direct cloning, assembly of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products by TAR, Golden gate cloning or Gibson assembly.96,113,114 These techniques will become even more important with the increased availability of cheap synthetic DNA that is more and more used as an alternative source for assembly of putative antibiotics BGCs (Fig. 5).

All these strategies for activation of a BGC or its heterologous expression are driven by the attempt to produce novel antibiotics.

Linking genomics to metabolomics data at the earliest stage Linking genomics to metabolomics data at the earliest stage Linking genomics to metabolomics data at the earliest stage In many instances, secondary metabolomics and microbial genomics are still treated as processes that are mostly performed separately or consecutively. Bringing together these domains, e.g. by associative statistics to link BGC appearances to MS signals, can speed up natural product discoveries and the detection of the corresponding biosynthetic machinery.117 As described in the paragraph on taxonomic diversity, many of these novel cryptic BGCs of interest are found in newly isolated wild type strains that are taxonomically distant from described type strains for which genetic engineering tools do not exist yet.88 Genomics analysis has been supported by varying technologies making investigation of strains not suitable for metabolomics studies (e.g. as they are hard to culture under laboratory conditions) accessible. With their genome sequence available, their BGCs can still be investigated with bioinformatics tools and prioritized BGCs can be expressed in heterologous hosts, as soon as entire BGCs are assembled by one of the aforementioned BGC assembly techniques.118 Using these technologies, the amount of genomics data already exceeds the metabolome data available. Looking forward, the imbalance between genomics and metabolomics is likely to increase rather than decrease, as the overall speed of genome sequencing, generation of publicly available genome sequence information and BGC prediction currently exceeds the speed of natural product isolation and structure elucidation by orders of magnitude.

Mining metagenomes to access BGCs of yet uncultured bacteria Mining metagenomes to access BGCs of yet uncultured bacteria Mining metagenomes to access BGCs of yet uncultured bacteria A large detriment to efficient mining of BGCs is that a significant number of newly observed microorganisms, especially those from uncommon ecological niches, are difficult to culture and thus uncultured under laboratory conditions.119 Thus, for many of these organisms, isolation of secondary metabolites from their wild type cultures remains out of reach unless an efficient approach of culturing these organisms is found. This holds especially true for symbionts, microorganisms that are often thought to be not viable in axenic culture.120 Metagenomics analyses indicate that large parts of microbial communities do not even have a single congener cultivated in the laboratory so far.18 Therefore, BGCs from underexploited or even uncultured microbial genera have a larger probability to be responsible for production of a structurally distinct natural product.

To access the biosynthetic potential of these organisms, metagenome BGC prediction is of great importance. As a note, one limitation might be that not all BGCs turn out to be co-localized in one genomic region. Such non-clustered BGCs of unknown function provide additional challenges for which currently no methodology of prediction and association is available. Mining tools such as eSNaPD, that streamline BGC detection and prediction from metagenomes, can help accessing the secondary metabolite space hidden in metagenomes.121 In addition to that, BGC cloning and heterologous expression techniques, such as recombineering (homologous recombination based genetic engineering) tools described earlier, furnish tools to capture these gene clusters and express them in taxonomically closely related laboratory strains to harness the encoded secondary metabolites (Fig. 5).113,122 To access the biosynthetic potential of these organisms, metagenome BGC prediction is of great importance.

Software solutions are increasingly used in natural product laboratories to sift through metabolomics data helping with automated detection of interesting mass spectrometry signals based on objective criteria.123 In addition to that, better access to larger computing power resources put the unbiased processing of large-scale metabolomics data into the mainstream of natural product research. Improvements in BGC prediction as well as the staggering increase in publicly available bacterial genome data led to an enormous boom in BGCs available for analysis while computing power currently available allows implementing, sorting and prioritization algorithms to quickly point at BGCs of interest.123 In summary, current developments in secondary metabolite identification processes boosted by innovations in novel instrumental analytics equipment (especially in the realm of mass spectrometry) are pushing detection limits and unlock a large, previously unseen part of the bacterial secondary metabolome.

Therefore, this process does not currently scale with the aforementioned improvements in genomics and metabolomics. Even though tandem mass-spectrometry based prediction of structural relatedness has improved greatly over the last years, as it is well exemplified by the aforementioned GNPS platform, de novo structure elucidation solely based on fragment spectra seems out of reach for now.63 Novel software frameworks such as SIRIUS 4.0 are able to match tandem MS spectra against libraries of predefined structure formulae, which in itself can be considered a big leap forward, but are still unable to predict unknown structures with accuracy.62 This process is therefore likely to remain the bottleneck in natural product science, unless there is a yet hardly imaginable ground breaking innovation as for example small molecule structure elucidation from mixtures by cryo-EM that would make isolation and structure elucidation scalable with the generation of genomics and metabolomics data. Discovery of biologically active bacterial secondary metabolites (here more specifically of antibiotics) in our opinion seems to neither be limited by the availability of BGCs as their numbers explode, even when only counting the ones found in the public domain, nor the amount of detectable mass spectrometry features provided from yet uncharacterized natural products.

Increasing sensitivity in mass spectrometers that are more commonly used in natural product laboratories, such as TOF, Orbitrap or FT-ICR systems is revealing an ever-increasing number of natural products in biological samples from an analytical chemistry point of view. Previously discussed alternatives to the most commonly employed LC-ESI-MS techniques were introduced by variations of ionization techniques, as well as the increasing introduction of direct infusion based metabolomics approaches in natural product laboratories, to broaden the scope of detectable natural product classes per extract. Thus, the fundamentals for a bright future for natural product based antibiotics research, meaning abundant metabolome data and a plethora of ‘orphan’ BGCs that are not yet correlated with any known natural product, are available.

The question of whether future antibiotics research based on bacterial secondary metabolomics will continue to thrive critically relies on innovative ways of BGC prioritization or efficient sorting, classification and prioritization of mass spectrometry data of microbial extracts and more importantly, the ability of the field to incorporate these novel developments into the mainstream of natural product research. In antibiotics research, solutions for prioritization of BGCs currently rely on prediction of self-resistance mechanisms, a technique that suffers from its inability to predict novel targets as the corresponding BGC encoded self-resistance mechanisms would necessarily also be unknown and thus not be predictable from genome sequence data alone. Selective activation of BGCs prioritized by architectural complexity is an efficient method to unlock larger structural diversity of secondary metabolites, but structural complexity of a bacterial secondary metabolite is not inherently correlated with strong biological activity. On the metabolomics side, pushing down detection limits has created an additional problem. The LC-MS data of microbial extracts created with state-of-the-art high-resolution mass spectrometers generate too much data for manual analysis. For objective unbiased interpretation of such analyses, automated data treatment is of utmost importance. In recent years, the field has seen progress as evidenced in the section on statistical data treatment, that helps classify the data created by a modern mass spectrometer into categories of potentially interesting secondary metabolites and matrix LC-MS signals such as medium derived LC-MS peaks. Secondary metabolite spectral networking has succeeded at extracting preliminary structural information at an early stage, but its usability depends on community curation of the corresponding open access repositories, such as spectral libraries and structure databases.

As a conclusion, we can determine that a wide variety of different methods is available to natural product scientists to harness the biosynthetic potential of microorganisms with the aforementioned technologies from an analytical chemistry perspective, as well as from an in silico genomics and molecular biology standpoint. Many laboratories still only focus on a limited set of natural product discovery methods and workflows, which have proven to be successful in the past, but tend to introduce heavy discovery biases. As we believe that this focus also strongly limits the detectable space of natural products, we suggest the evaluation of new technologies for antibiotics discovery continuously, while combining these efforts with in silico prediction methods to uncover the most promising secondary metabolites and secondary metabolite producers. Advances in detection and prioritization of structurally novel natural products and promising candidate BGCs will be crucial to increase the success rate of the downstream natural product discovery workflow parts with limited scalability such as heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters and structure elucidation. Feeding these currently non-scalable, labour-intensive parts of the natural product detection processes with well-curated metabolomics and/or genomics data – in the sense of carefully evaluated and interpreted MS data and well-prioritized orphan BGCs will ultimately determine success or failure of natural product sciences, as it critically influences its output of biologically active natural products.
