 Assembly-line polyketide synthases (PKSs) are among the
most complex
protein machineries known in nature, responsible for the biosynthesis
of numerous compounds used in the clinic. Their present-day diversity
is the result of an evolutionary path that has involved the emergence
of a multimodular architecture and further diversification of assembly-line
PKSs. In this review, we provide an overview of previous studies that
investigated PKS evolution and propose a model that challenges the
currently prevailing view that gene duplication has played a major
role in the emergence of multimodularity. We also analyze the ensemble
of orphan PKS clusters sequenced so far to evaluate how large the
entire diversity of assembly-line PKS clusters and their chemical
products could be. Finally, we examine the existing techniques to
access the natural PKS diversity in natural and heterologous hosts
and describe approaches to further expand this diversity through engineering. Introduction Introduction Polyketide Synthases (PKSs) Polyketide Synthases (PKSs) Polyketide Synthases (PKSs) Polyketide
synthases (PKSs) are multifunctional enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis
of numerous natural products, many of which are currently used as
antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), antiparasitic drugs (e.g., avermectin),
cholesterol-lowering agents (e.g., lovastatin), immunosuppressants
(e.g., FK506), and cancer chemotherapy (e.g., epothilone). PKSs are
classified into three types: type I PKSs are large multifunctional
proteins comprised of several functional domains and found in both
bacteria and fungi, type II PKSs are formed by discrete catalytic
domains and are typically found in bacteria, type III PKSs are simpler
chalcone synthase-type enzymes that catalyze the formation of the
product within a single active site, mainly in plants and bacteria.
Type I PKSs are subdivided into iterative PKSs (reviewed in ref (1)) and assembly-line PKSs,
also called modular PKSs (reviewed in ref (2)). Whereas an iterative PKS catalyzes multiple
chain elongation cycles using the same set of enzymatic domains, the
nascent polyketide chain is channeled from one module to another within
an assembly-line PKS such that each module typically catalyzes only
one elongation cycle. Iterative type I PKSs are primarily found in
fungi, while the assembly-line architecture predominates in bacteria,
although several eukaryotic assembly-line PKSs have also been identified. Polyketide

most complex biosynthetic protein machineries known in nature. The
structure and mechanism of assembly-line PKSs have been a subject
of numerous studies (reviewed in refs (3−6)). The catalytic chemistry of a prototypical assembly-line PKS is
schematically outlined in Figure 1. Within each module of the assembly-line, polyketide
acyl chain elongation is catalyzed collaboratively by a ketosynthase
(KS), an acyltransferase (AT), and an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain.
The ACP domain is post-translationally modified with a phosphopantetheinyl
(P-pant) “swinging arm” by a P-pant transferase (PPTase).
The KS receives the growing polyketide chain from the ACP of the previous
module, while the AT trans-esterifies an α-carboxyacyl extender
unit from an appropriate acyl-CoA metabolite onto the ACP. The KS
then catalyzes a decarboxylative Claisen-like condensation between
the polyketide intermediate and the extender unit. Before being translocated
onto the KS of the next module, the newly synthesized, ACP-bound β-ketothioester
intermediate can be modified by additional domains, such as a ketoreductase
(KR), dehydratase (DH), enoylreductase (ER), methyltransferase (MT),
or others. KR, DH, and ER successively and stereospecifically reduce
the extended product into a β-hydroxyl, alkene, and methylene
functionality, respectively; KR domains establish the stereoconfiguration
of both the α- and β-carbon atoms of their products. These
domains are usually encoded within the module but can also be present
as free-standing proteins in trans.7 Ultimately, the full-length polyketide is released from
the PKS by hydrolysis or macrocyclization catalyzed by a thioesterase
(TE) domain or reductive cleavage. This review focuses on assembly-line PKSs, which are among the

as cis-AT and trans-AT modules. cis-AT modules contain all three essential domains (KS,
AT, and ACP)
comprising a PKS, whereas in trans-AT modules the
extender unit is transacylated onto the ACP domain by a free-standing
AT that is often shared across multiple modules (reviewed in ref (8)). Modules are connected
either by intermodular linkers9 or, if
a PKS spans several polypeptides, by docking domains that establish
specific noncovalent interactions between successive modules.10 The architectures of cis-AT
PKSs are often colinear to their genetic encoding (i.e., the order
in which modules are encoded on the DNA level corresponds to the order
in which they operate), whereas the modules of trans-AT assembly lines are often not colinear.11 Individual modules of assembly-line PKSs are classified

and diversity could help us expand our therapeutic arsenal. On one
hand, exploration of natural PKS diversity holds the potential of
discovering assembly lines that synthesize new bioactive polyketides.
On the other hand, a better understanding of mechanisms used by nature
for polyketide diversification could open new avenues for PKS engineering.

is compelling evidence to suggest that all PKSs are evolutionarily
related: despite the differences in their architectures and mechanisms,
their domains belong to the same protein families and catalyze similar
reactions. However, the precise evolutionary relationships between
different PKSs are unclear and therefore present an outstanding challenge.
The multimodular architecture of assembly-line PKSs is uncommon among
proteins, meaning that the selective pressures and molecular mechanisms
involved in their evolution could be distinct from those operating
in most protein families. Nonuniform distribution of different PKS
types among bacterial and eukaryotic phyla further complicates the
challenge. If one assumes that iterative PKSs predated assembly lines,
then evolution of the present-day diversity of assembly-line PKSs
likely involved genetic processes such as mutation, gene fusion to
establish module architecture, gene duplication to yield multimodular
PKSs, and further diversification of assembly lines via mutation,
recombination, and interspecies horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (Figure 2A). There

evolution. The multidomain architecture of
type I PKS modules evidently arose through the fusion of genes encoding
single-domain proteins of type II systems. The processes that led
to the emergence of the multimodular architecture are less well understood.
For instance, it is unclear whether assembly-line systems evolved
from iterative PKSs that lost their ability to perform several consecutive
condensation reactions on the same polyketide chain or from a separate
subset of type II proteins. Once a set of assembly-line PKSs emerged,
other processes allowed further diversification of these modular enzymes

and assembly-line
PKSs lies in the chemistry of the chain translocation reaction involving
a KS and an ACP domain. Specifically, whereas KSs of iterative PKSs
operate multiple times on the same polyketide chain,16 the KS domains of assembly-line PKSs must release their
β-ketoacyl-ACP product before the newly vacated active site
Cys residue can attack the reactive thioester linkage in this product
(Figure 1C). While
the precise mechanism by which such back-transfer of the growing polyketide
chain is precluded remains unclear, chain elongation by assembly-line
PKS modules is energetically coupled to intermodular chain translocation
via a “turnstile” mechanism: a module is precluded from
accepting a new chain until the product of previous chain elongation
cycle has been passed down to the downstream module.17,18 This avoids KS reacylation by the downstream ACP and consequent
iterative chain elongation. The existence of the “turnstile”
mechanism suggests that chain translocation between different modules
is an evolutionarily acquired feature, i.e., a gain-of-function mutation
as opposed to a loss-of-function trait. The most profound difference between iterative

are products of divergent or convergent evolution.20,21 The evolutionary relatedness to type II PKS and FAS systems is even
more distant. Even though most enzymatic domains that form PKSs
and NRPSs belong
to different protein families, the two assembly-line systems use very
similar biosynthetic strategies and often form hybrid assemblies:
about one-third of biosynthetic gene clusters encode both types of
enzymes.28 These assembly lines appear
to have evolved to facilitate translocation of hybrid products between
individual PKS and NRPS modules, and their carrier proteins are serviced
by the same PPTases and TEs with broad substrate specificity (reviewed
in refs (29) and (30)). Surprisingly, hybrid
assemblies have a wide array of architectures including nonmodular,
iterative, assembly line, or mixed type.28 Given their prevalence and the presence of specialized domains and
interfaces to ensure intermodular interactions, it is tempting to
speculate that these hybrid assemblies appeared early in the evolutionary
history of polyketide and nonribosomal peptide natural products. However,

of PKS evolution and diversification, especially in the cases of trans-AT PKSs.34,65 In cis-AT PKSs, the lack of sequence conservation in docking domain pairs
that flank adjacent modules suggests that modules comprising this
class of assembly-line PKSs underwent recombinational shuffling.66 The rate of homologous recombination differs
between bacterial taxa and is particularly high in Streptomyces, which harbor a significant fraction
of known PKSs. These bacteria undergo extensive HGT and recombination
between species; these processes more recognized as being more important
in sequence divergence than point mutation.67 Homologous recombination within the same species is even higher,68 and its importance for the diversification of

PKSs evolved independently at least twice and converged to an almost
identical architecture. While not inconceivable, a single origin of

that the two classes of assembly-line PKSs are more closely related
than previously thought. Even though trans-AT PKS
modules lack an AT domain, they usually contain a region called ATd,
a subdomain nested between the KS and downstream domains.69 It is structurally similar to the rigid KS-AT

it is also unclear why only the phylogeny of KS domains supports this
model. One would expect other domains of duplicated modules to also
be closely related. However, the non-KS domains are phylogenetically
grouped by catalytic properties such as substrate specificity or stereospecificity
rather than by the assembly line of origin (section 2.2). While additional recombination events

tree
of KS domains itself is discordant.64 This
is exemplified by a set of homologous PKSs producing 16-membered macrolides
(Figure 3B). If module
duplication preceded the diversification of the resulting assembly-line
PKS into different homologous clusters, one would expect KS domains
to be more distant from paralogous KS domains within the same PKS
than from their orthologues. The phylogenetic tree shows a different
pattern: for many PKSs, their paralogous KS domains have the highest
sequence similarity. This discordance can be explained by extensive
gene conversion between paralogous KSs: this rate has been estimated
at 27%, and has been shown to result in a concerted evolution of PKS
modules (Figure 3C).64,82 If that is indeed the case, then the high sequence similarity between
paralogous KS domains is the result of recent gene conversion events,
rather than ancestral gene duplication that occurred during the emergence
of assembly-line architecture. Finally, under the hypothesis that multimodularity of cis-AT PKSs evolved through module duplication, the phylogenetic

of KS domains itself is discordant.64 This
is exemplified by a set of homologous PKSs producing 16-membered macrolides
(Figure 3B). If module
duplication preceded the diversification of the resulting assembly-line
PKS into different homologous clusters, one would expect KS domains
to be more distant from paralogous KS domains within the same PKS
than from their orthologues. The phylogenetic tree shows a different
pattern: for many PKSs, their paralogous KS domains have the highest
sequence similarity. This discordance can be explained by extensive
gene conversion between paralogous KSs: this rate has been estimated
at 27%, and has been shown to result in a concerted evolution of PKS
modules (Figure 3C).64,82 If that is indeed the case, then the high sequence similarity between
paralogous KS domains is the result of recent gene conversion events,
rather than ancestral gene duplication that occurred during the emergence
of assembly-line architecture. Finally, under the hypothesis that multimodularity of cis-AT PKSs evolved through module duplication, the phylogenetic
tree
of KS domains itself is discordant.64 This

discordances, we propose an alternative model for assembly-line PKS
evolution that applies to both cis-AT and trans-AT PKSs (Figure 3D). Our model is based on the premise of extensive
gene conversion between paralogous KS domains within the same cis-AT PKS, leading to repetitive regions of abnormally
high sequence similarity within the same assembly line.64,82 This would allow for an evolutionary process that is entirely analogous
to the mosaic-like assembly proposed for trans-AT
PKSs without the need to invoke extensive gene duplications.34 In addition to presenting a simpler logic for trans-AT PKS evolution from cis-AT PKSs
via the loss of AT domains, this model would also explain the absence
of iterative trans-AT PKSs, the presence of AT domain
remnants in many trans-AT PKSs, and the existence
of assembly-line PKSs (e.g., the NOCAP synthase discussed below) that
contain modules of both classes. The hypothesis of trans-AT PKS evolution through displacement of cis-AT

PKS Historically, the functional unit of a PKS was called
a module: a polypeptide containing KS-AT-(DH-KR-ER)-ACP domains and
able to perform one round of polyketide chain elongation and elaboration.85,86 It is also an architectural, and hence genetic, unit: this domain
order is conserved across vertebrate FASs, iterative PKSs, and cis-AT PKSs. However, it is unclear whether this genetic
unit also corresponds to an evolutionary unit that has been preserved
in multimodular PKSs. Each KS domain of an assembly-line PKSs must
interact with the ACP domain of its upstream module during chain translocation
as well as the ACP domain of its own module during chain elongation;
both reactions require specific protein–protein interactions

also referred to as the “screening hypothesis”,114,115 presumes that the selected trait is the adaptability itself, i.e.,
the capacity to generate and maintain the chemical diversity of secondary
metabolites that can be screened for advantageous properties when
needed. This model does not require all molecules to have a beneficial
function, so long as a few molecules provide enough advantage to maintain
the entire system. Two conceptually
different perspectives exist on the role and diversification of natural
products.21 According to a more traditional
viewpoint, the evolutionary advantage conferred by the function of
the molecule constitutes the trait under selection.113 Here, every molecule produced by a biosynthetic cluster
must have an advantageous biological activity to justify the metabolic
cost of its production and to be selected for. The alternative model,
also referred to as the “screening hypothesis”,114,115 presumes that the selected trait is the adaptability itself, i.e.,
the capacity to generate and maintain the chemical diversity of secondary
metabolites that can be screened for advantageous properties when

function, so long as a few molecules provide enough advantage to maintain
the entire system. The practical implications of the two models
for natural product chemistry are quite distinct. The first model
implies that screening for bioactive molecules holds great promise
for the discovery of novel molecules of therapeutic interest. On the
other hand, the second model anticipates that most natural products
do not have measurable bioactivity and that a large library would
be needed to screen for new therapeutics. While the available body
of knowledge is insufficient to provide conclusive evidence, the difficulty
in finding compounds with measurable bioactivity suggests that the
screening hypothesis may be more realistic. However, this hypothesis
also suggests that the mechanisms that create diversity are remarkable
and that their success rate is sufficient for their presence to be
selected for in bacterial genomes. This would imply that these same
mechanisms can be leveraged to generate diversity in the laboratory
and open new avenues for assembly-line PKS engineering (discussed
in section 5). Determining
the precise order of events leading to the appearance of contemporary
assembly-line PKSs would be an extremely challenging task. However,

above, the mechanisms and selective pressures involved
in the evolution of assembly-line PKSs have led to astounding polyketide
diversity. In this section, we will present computational approaches
for estimating this natural diversity, including an updated catalogue
of assembly-line PKSs found in the NCBI database. The number of novel
clusters sequenced every year reflects the vastness of the PKS sequence
space and the extent to which polyketide structural diversity is underexplored. As discussed

only offer a narrow glimpse into the diversity of assembly-line PKSs.
A powerful approach to evaluate the actual diversity of PKS clusters
and their products is through computational analysis of sequence databases.
Algorithms such as antiSMASH,121 ClusterFinder,122 PRISM,123 and others
(reviewed in refs (124,125)) allow users to mine sequenced data for microbial BGCs and predict
the biosynthesized product. Additional algorithms can improve predictions
for certain types of clusters: for example, NaPDoS uses domain phylogeny
to predict PKS and NRPS products,126 while
the TransATor allows a more accurate prediction of trans-AT PKS products based on the substrate specificity of their KS domains.127 Despite significant advances of in silico prediction
algorithms, determining the structure of a polyketide from its BGC
sequence alone remains an elusive goal. However, BGCs that make known polyketides

analyzing all assembly-line PKSs has been described previously.102 Briefly, a consensus ketosynthase (KS) sequence
was aligned using BLAST against nine NCBI DNA databases as well as
the archive for whole-genome shotgun sequences available as of May
2018. To select for multimodular PKSs, BLAST hits were refined by
requiring a minimum of 3 KS domains located within 20kb of each other,
and the PKS gene clusters that met this criterion were further analyzed
by antiSMASH 4.0.131 Identical PKSs were
eliminated based on either an identical sequence or an identical domain
architecture in the same species. From the remaining PKSs, the sequences
of individual PKS and NRPS proteins were extracted and subjected to
comparative pairwise analysis using BLAST, calculated as described
in ref (102). PKSs
that scored more than 90% in amino acid similarity were considered
redundant, yielding the final catalogue of distinct assembly-line
PKSs (Figure 4). As
before, cluster similarity scores were visualized in the form of a
dendrogram. The general strategy for compiling and phylogenetically

the number of clusters producing different molecules. On the basis
of similarities between nine 16-membered macrolide PKSs (46–89%
similar, with a mean of 56%), we assume that assembly lines with higher
than 50% similarity could make identical or very similar molecules.
(As a point of reference, the tylactone and rosamicin synthases are
72% similar and produce the same polyketide backbone.) It should be
noted that the tailoring enzymes associated with a given biosynthetic
cluster differ even for PKSs with high sequence similarity and give
rise to distinct natural products. Nonetheless, on the basis of the
above arguments, we assume that PKSs that are less than 50% similar
most likely produce polyketide products that could be regarded as
distinct chemotypes. The number of distinct assembly-line PKSs is astonishing in itself.

of orphan assembly-line
PKSs to any previously characterized PKS, it is possible to estimate
how diverse their products are from known polyketide natural products.
Remarkably, more than one-half of all orphan assembly lines show less
than 50% sequence similarity to any known PKS (Figure 5C). Although the rate of chemically decoding
orphan assembly-line PKSs cannot possibly keep up with their discovery
(Figure 5D, red line),
it appears that the fraction of orphan PKSs making polyketides whose
structures are related to known natural products is increasing (Figure 5D, blue line). This
fraction, however, is likely an overestimate because only ca. 20%
of the emerging orphan PKSs preserve the same architecture over the
entire assembly line. (Most of the orphan PKSs that comprise the blue
line statistics in Figure 6B share their assembly-line architecture with a substantial
portion, but not all, of a characterized PKS.) Nonetheless, the overall
upward trend suggests that, while modern genomics-driven natural products
discovery may be steadily sampling the actual diversity of assembly-line
PKSs in nature, the major part of this diversity has not yet been

at least one known PKS may warrant investigation, as they could yield
natural products with related properties. On the other hand, by exploring
a disconnected group of orphan PKSs, one could discover truly novel

of the most interesting and novel clusters, several computational

can be based on the novelty of the product’s chemical structure,

with known BGCs. On the protein level, EvoMining reconstructs evolutionary

of BiG-SCAPE and CORASON tools opens the possibility to analyze BGC
similarity networks and cluster group phylogenies to direct genome
mining approaches either toward the discovery of molecules with novel
structures or explore known compound analogues.155 On the other hand, cluster prioritization can be based
directly on the nature of enzymes present in the cluster. For instance,
the ARTS tool predicts clusters that are more likely to produce a
molecule with an antibiotic activity based on the presence of self-resistance
genes: BGC-encoded genes that are homologous to the antibiotic target

many of these BGCs are tightly regulated.181 For organisms that are culturable and amenable to genetic manipulation,
researchers rely on either overexpressing positive transcription regulators
or deleting negative regulators to activate these normally silent
BGCs. Some microorganisms harbor dozens of BGCs, many of which encode
orphan assembly-line PKSs. For example, certain strains of Streptomyces are capable of producing as many as
50 distinct natural products.180 However,
many of these BGCs are tightly regulated.181 For organisms that are culturable and amenable to genetic manipulation,
researchers rely on either overexpressing positive transcription regulators
or deleting negative regulators to activate these normally silent
BGCs. For example, Bibb and co-workers identified a cryptic
29.5 kb gene cluster containing both modular type I and type III PKSs
from Streptomyces venezuelae that was
predicted to encode a biaryl metabolite, venemycin.182 However, both the native host and a heterologous Streptomyces coelicolor host harboring this cluster
yielded insufficient venemycin for structural analysis. To overcome
this challenge, they overexpressed vemR, a transcriptional
activator from the ATP-binding LuxR-like (LAL) family, with the constitutive
promoter ermE* in both strains, resulting in the
production of adequate venemycin for structural characterization,
confirming its unusual biaryl structure. Similarly, an orphan ansamycin
PKS cluster was activated in Streptomyces sp. XZQH13 by constitutive expression of another LAL family regulator
gene astG1, leading to the isolation of two known
ansatrienins, hydroxymycotrienin A, and thiazinotrienomycin G.183 Another orphan ansamycin PKS cluster was activated
in Streptomyces sp. LZ35 by constitutive
overexpression of a LuxR family transcriptional regulatory gene, leading
to the discovery of three new naphthalenic ansamycins, neoansamycins
A–C.184 This approach can be further
developed for high throughput activation of silent BGCs. In a step
toward this direction, CRISPR/Cas9 methods have been used to delete
genes185 or knock-in promoters in Streptomyces.186 Notably,
a promoter knock-in strategy led to activate BGCs of different classes
(type I, II, and III PKSs, NRPS, hybrid PKS-NRPS, and phosphonate)
in multiple Streptomyces species.186 Along similar lines, CRISPRi, which utilizes
a catalytically dead Cas9 to interfere with gene expression in a sequence-specific
manner, has been used to repress transcription of negative regulatory
genes.187 The efficacy of these strategies
is pathway-specific. For example, if a BGC contains multiple operons,
then overexpression of one activator or knock-in of a single promoter
may not be sufficient for activation. For example, Bibb and co-workers identified a cryptic
29.5 kb gene cluster containing both modular type I and type III PKSs

beyond the chemical landscape of natural compounds, for instance,
to introduce small changes to the structure that would improve the
molecule’s bioactivity or bioavailability, much-sought results
in medicinal chemistry. However, the task of PKS engineering is challenging.

These included deletion, insertion, or replacement of intact domains
and modules, engineering of substrate specificity, and metabolic supply

diversity of natural assembly-line PKSs is all the more astonishing.
The toolkit of molecular mechanisms and evolutionary strategies employed
by nature appears to be much better suited for the challenge than
the strategies typically used in the lab. The idea of taking inspiration
from natural approaches for PKS engineering was proposed more than
a decade ago65 and was developed in two
directions. One uses natural evolution to guide the choice of splice
points for further engineering by traditional cloning techniques,
while the other uses natural recombination mechanisms for generating
novel PKSs (Figure 9). Given the difficulty of engineering PKSs in the laboratory, the catalytic

of the modular and colinear architecture of assembly-line PKSs, it
is particularly appealing to engineer them by modifying single domains
or modules to introduce small and predictable changes in the structure
of the biosynthetic product. While point mutations can increase domain
promiscuity or inactivate them, they rarely lead to altered domain
function without compromising specificity or PKS turnover (reviewed
in ref (204)). It appears
that PKS evolution did not rely on point mutations to change domain
specificity either: domains with the same specificity are phylogenetically
close (see section 2.2), suggesting that they originated from the same common ancestor
rather than independently through point mutations. Instead, changes
in domain specificity probably arise through domain swaps by recombination,
which has prompted a search for natural splice points that can be
exploited for engineering (Figure 10A, left). Because AT domains
are responsible for selecting starter and extender units in polyketide
biosynthesis, swapping them is an appealing strategy for product modification.
AT domain swaps have been shown to yield functional chimeric PKSs
as early as 1996.194 Later studies revealed
the presence of conserved regions in KS-AT interdomain linker (also
called KAL) and post-AT linker, which most likely correspond to natural
splice points and can be used for AT domain swapping.41,205 These linkers may be responsible for maintaining structural integrity
of the module upon recombination, thus enhancing the evolutionary
degrees of freedom of assembly-line PKSs.41 Conserved regions flanking AT domains were used as splice points
to emulate natural recombination and exchange between modules: either
from the same PKS as in the case of aureothin synthase, or from a
homologous PKS as in the case of antimycin and antimycin-like synthases,
leading to fully functional chimeric assembly-line PKSs.206,207 Because

in PKS engineering involves deleting,
inserting, or swapping entire modules, leading to changes in the polyketide
chain length. Under the current evolutionary model that considers
gene duplication as a major step leading to the multimodular architectures
of cis-AT PKSs, it is reasonable to assume that the
unit of duplication corresponds to the KS-AT-(KR-DH-ER)-ACP module,
which is the functional unit of chain elongation and matches the boundaries
of unimodular proteins. This assumption has led to the use of intermodular

early on, it became apparent that modules can be deleted,
swapped, or inserted at other splice points as well (Figure 10B, right). In 2004, the KS-AT
linker region was used to delete two modules of amphotericin synthase,
resulting in a functional PKS, producing high yields of the shortened

have been found to harbor a large number of symbiotic bacteria from
the genus Entotheonella, which produces
natural products with a chemical richness that might be comparable
to soil actinomycetes.97,228 More generally, unculturable
bacteria is a promising source of new BGCs, but their DNA can be difficult
to retrieve. Several pipelines have been developed that allow culture-independent
sequencing, extraction, prioritization, and characterization of DNA

encoding PKSs and NRPSs.151,229 As they become more
versatile, the discovery of novel polyketides from metagenomic libraries
may also become more powerful. Finally, it should be
recognized that, although a tremendous diversity
of assembly-line PKSs has been revealed through DNA sequencing, it
is possible that biases in genomic and metagenomic sequencing have
created a corresponding bias in our insights into PKS assembly lines.
One way to assess the existence of such bias is by targeting underexplored
bacterial phyla and environmental niches. For example, marine sponges
have been found to harbor a large number of symbiotic bacteria from
the genus Entotheonella, which produces
natural products with a chemical richness that might be comparable
to soil actinomycetes.97,228 More generally, unculturable
bacteria is a promising source of new BGCs, but their DNA can be difficult
to retrieve. Several pipelines have been developed that allow culture-independent
sequencing, extraction, prioritization, and characterization of DNA
encoding PKSs and NRPSs.151,229 As they become more

PKS Clusters Overcoming Technical Challenges in Deorphanizing
PKS Clusters Overcoming Technical Challenges in Deorphanizing
PKS Clusters The techniques described in section 4 enable researchers to rapidly
travel from gene to polyketide discovery. However, the path from polyketide
discovery to polyketide deorphanization remains slow and painstaking,
as there are a multitude of factors that govern a polyketide’s
production and stability. This challenge is the most significant barrier
to quickly uncovering the chemical diversity of orphan polyketides.
Without a complete structure, a polyketide, or its novel analogues,
cannot be prepared by chemical synthesis, a route that can produce
compounds at scales possibly unobtainable with either native or heterologous
hosts. Notably, the absence of this information precludes detailed
bioactivity experiments such as molecular-level structure–function
analysis. To overcome this challenge, researchers must develop tools
and strategies to analyze low abundance products. Arguably, the most
notorious example is colibactin. Colibactin is a genotoxic hybrid
polyketide–nonribosomal peptide produced in some gut commensal E. coli strains and is intriguingly associated with
colorectal cancer.134 Recently, the Crawford
and Herzon groups used an interdisciplinary approach that involved
genetics, isotope labeling, tandem mass spectrometry, and chemical
synthesis to finally elucidate the full structure of colibactin.230 For over a decade, no work, despite considerable
efforts from several laboratories, had described the identification,
isolation, and structural elucidation of the unstable final colibactin.
In one herculean effort, 2000 L of culture were required to manufacture
just 50 μg of a biosynthetic intermediate of colibactin for
structural analysis using 1D and 2D NMR as well as tandem mass spectrometry.231 Intriguing approaches like the one used for
colibactin could be combined with yield optimization techniques in
native or heterologous hosts to facilitate the deorphanization of
polyketides in a timely manner. The techniques described in section 4 enable researchers to rapidly

not only in advancing the fundamental understanding of these enzymes
but also in enabling practical applications. As described in section 5, an understanding
of evolutionary processes can also be used for assembly-line PKS engineering.
However, many questions about assembly-line PKS evolution remain to
be answered. Perhaps foremost on this list is understanding how iterative
PKSs gave rise to their assembly line counterparts. Other evolutionary
questions are equally relevant. For example, how did trans-AT PKSs emerge from their cis-AT predecessors through
the loss of AT domain? And what can we learn about PKS evolution from
their nonuniform distribution among bacteria? Evolutionary analyses of assembly-line PKSs have proven their value
not only in advancing the fundamental understanding of these enzymes
but also in enabling practical applications. As described in section 5, an understanding
of evolutionary processes can also be used for assembly-line PKS engineering.
