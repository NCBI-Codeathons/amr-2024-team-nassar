Abstract Pseudomonas species have become promising cell factories for the production of natural products due to their inherent robustness. Although these bacteria have naturally evolved strategies to cope with different kinds of stress, many biotechnological applications benefit from engineering of optimised chassis strains with specially adapted tolerance traits. Here, we explored the formation of outer membrane vesicles (OMV) of Pseudomonas putida KT2440. We found OMV production to correlate with the recombinant production of a natural compound with versatile beneficial properties, the tripyrrole prodigiosin. Further, several P. putida genes were identified, whose up‐ or down‐regulated expression allowed controlling OMV formation. Finally, genetically triggering vesiculation in production strains of the different alkaloids prodigiosin, violacein, and phenazine‐1‐carboxylic acid, as well as the carotenoid zeaxanthin, resulted in up to three‐fold increased product yields. Consequently, our findings suggest that the construction of robust strains by genetic manipulation of OMV formation might be developed into a useful tool which may contribute to improving limited biotechnological applications. The study explores the formation of outer membrane vesicles of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as support mechanism for natural compound production. We first show that vesiculation and recombinant valuable compound production are correlated. We further genetically engineer P. putida for enhanced vesiculation which facilitated increased production levels of a range of natural products. Our findings suggest that this approach may provide a tool for improving hitherto limited biotechnological applications.
