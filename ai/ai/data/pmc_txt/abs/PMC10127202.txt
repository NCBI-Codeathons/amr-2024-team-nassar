 In
this study, an unprecedented myxobacterial siderophore
termed
sorangibactin was discovered by heterologous expression of a coelibactin-like
nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster from the Sorangiineae strain MSr11367 in the host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622. De novo structure elucidation
uncovered a linear polycyclic structure consisting of an N-terminal
phenol group, an oxazole, tandem N-methyl-thiazolidines,
and an unusual C-terminal γ-thiolactone moiety. Except for the
unprecedented oxazoline dehydrogenation to form an oxazole, which
we show to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme, other
tailoring steps were found necessary for efficient downstream processing.
The unusual thioesterase (TE) domain is proposed to select homocysteine
or methionine for offloading involving an intramolecular γ-thiolactone
formation. Its active site comprises a rare cysteine, which was found
essential for product formation by point mutation to alanine or serine,
which both abolished its activity. This unusual release mechanism
and the resulting rare thiolactone structure can serve as a starting
point for detailed biochemical investigations.
