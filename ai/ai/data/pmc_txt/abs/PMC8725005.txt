The crystal structure of DynF was determined to a resolution of 1.50 Å, revealing a dimeric eight-stranded β-barrel structure with palmitic acid bound in the interior. Dynemicin is an enediyne natural product from Micromonospora chersina ATCC53710. Access to the biosynthetic gene cluster of dynemicin has enabled the in vitro study of gene products within the cluster to decipher their roles in assembling this unique molecule. This paper reports the crystal structure of DynF, the gene product of one of the genes within the biosynthetic gene cluster of dynemicin. DynF is revealed to be a dimeric eight-stranded β-barrel structure with palmitic acid bound within a cavity. The presence of palmitic acid suggests that DynF may be involved in binding the precursor polyene heptaene, which is central to the synthesis of the ten-membered ring of the enediyne core.
