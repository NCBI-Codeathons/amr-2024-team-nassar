Clavulanic acid (CA) is an irreversible β-lactamase enzyme inhibitor with a weak antibacterial activity produced by Streptomyces clavuligerus (S. clavuligerus). CA is typically co-formulated with broad-spectrum β‑lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin, conferring them high potential to treat diseases caused by bacteria that possess β‑lactam resistance. The clinical importance of CA and the complexity of the production process motivate improvements from an interdisciplinary standpoint by integrating metabolic engineering strategies and knowledge on metabolic and regulatory events through systems biology and multi-omics approaches. In the large-scale bioprocessing, optimization of culture conditions, bioreactor design, agitation regime, as well as advances in CA separation and purification are required to improve the cost structure associated to CA production. This review presents the recent insights in CA production by S. clavuligerus, emphasizing on systems biology approaches, strain engineering, and downstream processing.
