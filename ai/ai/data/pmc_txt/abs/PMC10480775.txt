The study aimed to reveal the structure and function of phageome existing in soil rhizobiome of Abutilon fruticosum in order to detect accidentally-packaged bacterial genes that encode Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (or CAZymes) and those that confer antibiotic resistance (e.g., antibiotic resistance genes or ARGs). Highly abundant genes were shown to mainly exist in members of the genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus. Enriched CAZymes belong to glycoside hydrolase families GH4, GH6, GH12, GH15 and GH43 and mainly function in D-glucose biosynthesis via 10 biochemical passages. Another enriched CAZyme, e.g., alpha-galactosidase, of the GH4 family is responsible for the wealth of different carbohydrate forms in rhizospheric soil sink of A. fruticosum. ARGs of this phageome include the soxR and OleC genes that participate in the “antibiotic efflux pump” resistance mechanism, the parY mutant gene that participates in the “antibiotic target alteration” mechanism and the arr-1, iri, and AAC(3)-Ic genes that participate in the “antibiotic inactivation” mechanism. It is claimed that the genera Streptomyces, which harbors phages with oleC and parY mutant genes, and Pseudomonas, which harbors phages with soxR and AAC(3)-Ic genes, are approaching multidrug resistance via newly disseminating phages. These ARGs inhibit many antibiotics including oleandomycin, tetracycline, rifampin and aminoglycoside. The study highlights the possibility of accidental packaging of these ARGs in soil phageome and the risk of their horizontal transfer to human gut pathogens through the food chain as detrimental impacts of soil phageome of A. fruticosum. The study also emphasizes the beneficial impacts of phageome on soil microbiome and plant interacting in storing carbohydrates in the soil sink for use by the two entities upon carbohydrate deprivation.
