Natural scaffolds remain an important basis for drug development. Therefore, approaches to natural bioactive compound discovery attract significant attention. In this account, we summarize modern and emerging trends in the screening and identification of natural antibiotics. The methods are divided into three large groups: approaches based on microbiology, chemistry, and molecular biology. The scientific potential of the methods is illustrated with the most prominent and recent results.
