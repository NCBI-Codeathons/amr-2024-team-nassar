Significance Resistance gene–guided genome mining presents a solution to a longstanding challenge in natural product drug discovery by allowing the prediction of a natural product’s molecular target directly from the sequence of the gene cluster responsible for its biosynthesis. We apply the approach to reveal roseopurpurin C as a potent inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). This work represents an example of the use of resistance gene–guided genome mining in fungi for the identification of an inhibitor of a target that has been clinically validated for the treatment of multiple cancers. With the significant increase in the availability of microbial genome sequences in recent years, resistance gene–guided genome mining has emerged as a powerful approach for identifying natural products with specific bioactivities. Here, we present the use of this approach to reveal the roseopurpurins as potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), a class of cell cycle regulators implicated in multiple cancers. We identified a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) with a putative resistance gene with homology to human CDK2. Using targeted gene disruption and transcription factor overexpression in Aspergillus uvarum, and heterologous expression of the BGC in Aspergillus nidulans, we demonstrated that roseopurpurin C (1) is produced by this cluster and characterized its biosynthesis. We determined the potency, specificity, and mechanism of action of 1 as well as multiple intermediates and shunt products produced from the BGC. We show that 1 inhibits human CDK2 with a Kiapp of 44 nM, demonstrates selectivity for clinically relevant members of the CDK family, and induces G1 cell cycle arrest in HCT116 cells. Structural analysis of 1 complexed with CDK2 revealed the molecular basis of ATP-competitive inhibition.
