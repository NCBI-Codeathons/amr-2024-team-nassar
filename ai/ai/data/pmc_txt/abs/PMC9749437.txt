Abstract This work explores three areas of relevance to the gut microbiome in the context of One Health; the incorporation of the microbiome in food safety risk assessment of xenobiotics; the identification and application of beneficial microbial components to various areas under One Health, and specifically, in the context of antimicrobial resistance. We conclude that, although challenging, focusing on the microbiota resilience, function and active components, are critical for advancing the incorporation of the gut microbiome in the risk assessment of xenobiotics. Moreover, research technologies, such as toxicomicrobiomics, culturomics and genomics, especially in combination, have revealed that the human microbiota may be a promising source of beneficial taxa or other components, with the potential to metabolise and biodegrade xenobiotics. These may have possible applications in several health areas, including in animals or plants for detoxification or in the environment for bioremediation. This approach would be of particular interest for antimicrobials, with the potential to ameliorate antimicrobial resistance development. Finally, we propose that the concept of resistance to xenobiotics in the context of the gut microbiome may deserve further investigation in the pursuit of holistically elucidating their involvement in the balance between health and disease.
