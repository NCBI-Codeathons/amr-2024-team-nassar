enzyme-like oxidases are often involved in natural
product biosynthesis and are seen as essential enzymes for the generation
of intricate pharmacophores. These oxidases have the ability to transfer
a hydride atom to the FAD cofactor, which enables complex substrate
modifications and rearrangements including (intramolecular) cyclizations,
carbonâ€“carbon bond formations, and nucleophilic additions.
Despite the diverse range of activities, the mechanistic details of
these reactions often remain incompletely understood. In this Review,
we delve into the complexity that BBE-like oxidases from bacteria,
fungal, and plant origins exhibit by providing an overview of the
shared catalytic features and emphasizing the different reactivities.
We propose four generalized modes of action by which BBE-like oxidases
enable the synthesis of natural products, ranging from the classic
alcohol oxidation reactions to less common amine and amide oxidation
reactions. Exploring the mechanisms utilized by nature to produce
its vast array of natural products is a subject of considerable interest
and can lead to the discovery of unique biochemical activities.
