Simple Summary Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat; its indiscriminate use has led to management restrictions in humans and animals. Bacteriocins are powerful antimicrobial peptides that have great potential in the prevention and treatment of diseases in animals. Their antimicrobial activity is rapid, and they show a lower propensity to develop resistance than conventional antibiotics. Currently, their main application is in food preservation systems. However, several studies show their bioactive role as antimicrobials, probiotics, and immunomodulators in animals. Therefore, bacteriocins are an excellent alternative to be applied in several areas of veterinary medicine. Abstract In the search for an alternative treatment to reduce antimicrobial resistance, bacteriocins shine a light on reducing this problem in public and animal health. Bacteriocins are peptides synthesized by bacteria that can inhibit the growth of other bacteria and fungi, parasites, and viruses. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a group of bacteria that produce bacteriocins; their mechanism of action can replace antibiotics and prevent bacterial resistance. In veterinary medicine, LAB and bacteriocins have been used as antimicrobials and probiotics. However, another critical role of bacteriocins is their immunomodulatory effect. This review shows the advances in applying bacteriocins in animal production and veterinary medicine, highlighting their biological roles.
