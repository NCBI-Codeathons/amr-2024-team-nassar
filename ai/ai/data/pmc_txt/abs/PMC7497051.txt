Abstract Tropone natural products are non‐benzene aromatic compounds of significant ecological and pharmaceutical interest. Herein, we highlight current knowledge on bacterial tropones and their derivatives such as tropolones, tropodithietic acid, and roseobacticides. Their unusual biosynthesis depends on a universal CoA‐bound precursor featuring a seven‐membered carbon ring as backbone, which is generated by a side reaction of the phenylacetic acid catabolic pathway. Enzymes encoded by separate gene clusters then further modify this key intermediate by oxidation, CoA‐release, or incorporation of sulfur among other reactions. Tropones play important roles in the terrestrial and marine environment where they act as antibiotics, algaecides, or quorum sensing signals, while their bacterial producers are often involved in symbiotic interactions with plants and marine invertebrates (e. g., algae, corals, sponges, or mollusks). Because of their potent bioactivities and of slowly developing bacterial resistance, tropones and their derivatives hold great promise for biomedical or biotechnological applications, for instance as antibiotics in (shell)fish aquaculture. Accidents will happen: The biosynthesis of bacterial tropone natural products depends on an unusual intertwining of primary and secondary metabolism. Remarkably, a shunt product arising from a “metabolic accident” of an aromatic catabolic pathway serves as universal precursor for tropone natural products.
