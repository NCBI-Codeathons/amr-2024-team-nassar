 Synthetic
biology offers a new path for the exploitation and improvement
of natural products to address the growing crisis in antibiotic resistance.
All antibiotics in clinical use are facing eventual obsolesce as a
result of the evolution and dissemination of resistance mechanisms,
yet there are few new drug leads forthcoming from the pharmaceutical
sector. Natural products of microbial origin have proven over the
past 70 years to be the wellspring of antimicrobial drugs. Harnessing
synthetic biology thinking and strategies can provide new molecules
and expand chemical diversity of known antibiotic scaffolds to provide
much needed new drug leads. The glycopeptide antibiotics offer paradigmatic
scaffolds suitable for such an approach. We review these strategies
here using the glycopeptides as an example and demonstrate how synthetic
biology can expand antibiotic chemical diversity to help address the
growing resistance crisis.
