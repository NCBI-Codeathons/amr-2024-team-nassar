 Pedobacter cryoconitis strain UP508 was isolated
from a soil sample using a mixture of ampicillin, kanamycin, and nalidixic
acid for selection. UP508 was found to produce >30 unknown antibacterial
peptides, of which eight, isopedopeptins A–H (1–8), were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation
and characterized with respect to structures and biological properties.
Compounds 1–8 were all composed of
nine amino acid residues and one 3-hydroxy fatty acid residue, and
the structures were ring-closed via an ester bond from the C-terminal
aspartic acid to the 3-hydroxy fatty acid. The differences between
the peptides were the size and branching of the 3-hydroxy fatty acid
and the presence of a valine or a 3-hydroxyvaline residue. The isopedopeptins
mainly had activity against Gram-negative bacteria, and isopedopeptin
B (2), which had the best combination of antibacterial
activity, in vitro cytotoxicity, and hemolytic properties,
was selected for further studies against a larger panel of Gram-negative
bacteria. Isopedopeptin B was found to have good activity against
strains of WHO top-priority Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimal inhibitory
concentrations (MIC) down to 1, 2, and 4 μg/mL, respectively.
Furthermore, compound 2 had activity against colistin-resistant
strains of A. baumannii, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with a MIC down to
8, 2, and 4 μg/mL, respectively. Compound 6 was
tested in an E. coli liposome system where it induced
significant leakage, indicating membrane disruption as one mechanism
involved in isopedopeptin antibacterial activity. Isopedopeptin B
stands out as a promising candidate for further studies with the goal
to develop a new antibiotic drug.
