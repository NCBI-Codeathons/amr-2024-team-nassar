The peptidyl nucleoside blasticidin S (BS) produced by Streptomyces griseochromogenes was the first non-mercurial fungicide used to prevent rice blast and increasingly used as a selection reagent in transgenic study. Acylation by addition of a leucine residue at the beta amine group of arginine side chain of demethylblasticidin S (DBS) has been proposed as a novel self-resistance to the cytotoxic biosynthetic intermediate. But the resultant product leucyldemethylblasticidin S (LDBS) has not been isolated as a metabolite, and LDBS synthetase activity remained to be demonstrated in S. griseochromogenes. In this study, we isolated LDBS in a BS heterologous producer S. lividans WJ2 upon the deletion of blsL, which encodes a S-Adenosyl methionine-dependent methyltransferase. Purified BlsL efficiently methylated LDBS at the delta N of beta-arginine to generate the ultimate intermediate LBS, but nearly didnâ€™t methylate DBS to final product BS. Above experiments demonstrated that LDBS is indeed an intermediate in BS biosynthetic pathway, and acylation of beta-amino group of arginine side chain is prerequisite for efficient guanidine N-methylation in addition to being a self-resistance mechanism.
