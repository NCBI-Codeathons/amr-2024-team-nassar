Submerged cultivation of Hypomontagnella monticulosa MUCL 54604 resulted in formation of a stereoisomeric mixture of new sulfur-containing sporothriolide derivatives named sporothioethers A and B. The presence of the 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropanoic acid moiety attenuates the antimicrobial activity in comparison to the precursor sporothriolide suggesting a detoxification mechanism. However, moderate effects on biofilms of Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus were observed for sporothriolide and sporothioethers A and B at concentrations below their MICs. Two new thioether specialised metabolites isolated from the fungus Hypomontagnella monticulosa show attenuated antifungal properties, but retain biofilm inhibition activity.
