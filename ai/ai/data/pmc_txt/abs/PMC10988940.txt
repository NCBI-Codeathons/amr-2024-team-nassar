Surfactin is a cyclic hexalipopeptide compound, nonribosomal synthesized by representatives of the Bacillus subtilis species complex which includes B. subtilis group and its closely related species, such as B. subtilis subsp subtilis, B. subtilis subsp spizizenii, B. subtilis subsp inaquosorum, B. atrophaeus, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. velezensis (Steinke mSystems 6: e00057, 2021) It functions as a biosurfactant and signaling molecule and has antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, and plant disease resistance properties. The Bacillus lipopeptides play an important role in agriculture, oil recovery, cosmetics, food processing and pharmaceuticals, but the natural yield of surfactin synthesized by Bacillus is low. This paper reviews the regulatory pathways and mechanisms that affect surfactin synthesis and release, highlighting the regulatory genes involved in the transcription of the srfAA-AD operon. The several ways to enhance surfactin production, such as governing expression of the genes involved in synthesis and regulation of surfactin synthesis and transport, removal of competitive pathways, optimization of media, and fermentation conditions were commented. This review will provide a theoretical platform for the systematic genetic modification of high-yielding strains of surfactin. Graphical Abstract
