Biofilms are mono- or multispecies microbial communities enclosed in an extracellular matrix (EPS). They have high potential for dissemination and are difficult to remove. In addition, biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant strains (MDRs) are even more aggravated if we consider antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as an important public health issue. Quorum sensing (QS) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are mechanisms that significantly contribute to the recalcitrance (resistance and tolerance) of biofilms, making them more robust and resistant to conventional sanitation methods. These mechanisms coordinate different strategies involved in AMR, such as activation of a quiescent state of the cells, moderate increase in the expression of the efflux pump, decrease in the membrane potential, antimicrobial inactivation, and modification of the antimicrobial target and the architecture of the EPS matrix itself. There are few studies investigating the impact of the use of inhibitors on the mechanisms of recalcitrance and its impact on the microbiome. Therefore, more studies to elucidate the effect and applications of these methods in the food production chain and the possible combination with antimicrobials to establish new strategies to control MDR biofilms are needed.
