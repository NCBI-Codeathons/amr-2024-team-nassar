Multiple drug resistance poses a significant threat to public health worldwide, with a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality rates. Consequently, searching for novel strategies to control microbial pathogenicity is necessary. With the aid of auto-inducers (AIs), quorum sensing (QS) regulates bacterial virulence factors through cell-to-cell signaling networks. AIs are small signaling molecules produced during the stationary phase. When bacterial cultures reach a certain level of growth, these molecules regulate the expression of the bound genes by acting as mirrors that reflect the inoculum density. Gram-positive bacteria use the peptide derivatives of these signaling molecules, whereas Gram-negative bacteria use the fatty acid derivatives, and the majority of bacteria can use both types to modulate the expression of the target gene. Numerous natural and synthetic QS inhibitors (QSIs) have been developed to reduce microbial pathogenesis. Applications of QSI are vital to human health, as well as fisheries and aquaculture, agriculture, and water treatment.
