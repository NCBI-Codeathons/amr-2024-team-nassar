ABSTRACT We report the isolation, whole-genome sequencing, and annotation of Enterobacter sp. strain RIT 637, Pseudomonas sp. strain RIT 778, and Deinococcus sp. strain RIT 780. Disk diffusion assays using spent medium demonstrated that all bacteria produced bactericidal compounds against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923.
