Summary Bergamotenes are bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane sesquiterpenes found abundantly in plants and fungi. Known bergamotene derivatives all possess (2S,6S)-bergamotene backbone. In this study, two (+)-α-trans-bergamotene derivatives (1 and 2) with unusual (2R,6R) configuration were isolated and elucidated from marine fungus Nectria sp. HLS206. The first (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase NsBERS was characterized using genome mining and heterologous expression-based strategies. Based on homology search, we characterized another (+)-α-trans-bergamotene synthase LsBERS from Lachnellula suecica and an (+)-α-bisabolol synthase BcBOS from Botrytis cinerea. We proposed that the cyclization mechanism of (+)-α-trans-bergamotene involved endo-anti cyclization of left-handed helix farnesyl pyrophosphate by (6R)-bisabolyl cation, which was supported by molecular docking. The biosynthesis-based volatiles (3–6) produced by heterologous fungal expression systems elicited significant electroantennographic responses of Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera frugiperda, respectively, suggesting their potential in biocontrol of these pests. This work enriches diversity of sesquiterpenoids and fungal sesquiterpene synthases, providing insight into the enzymatic mechanism of formation of enantiomeric sesquiterpenes.
