Bacillus siamensis strain B28 was previously isolated from traditional Korean fermented kimchi and inhibited expression of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and β-catenin in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Here, we determined the complete genome sequence of strain B28 and compared it with other strains to elucidate its potential probiotic properties. Strain B28 does not contain antibiotic resistance-, hemolysin- or enterotoxin-encoding genes. The genome includes genes related to survival in extreme conditions, adhesion in the gut, and synthesis of the bacteriocin. Considering the potential for enhancement of human health, the strain B28 genome encodes genes related to production of eight essential amino acids, γ-aminobutyric acid, branched-chain fatty acids, γ-glutamyltransferase, and subtilisin. There are genes for the synthesis of uracil, lipoteichoic acid, glutathione, and several reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzymes. Experimentally, strain B28 exhibited sensitivity to eight antibiotics and antibacterial activity against seven foodborne pathogens. B. siamensis B28 is a safe strain with potential for development as a probiotic.
