Anaerobic fungi produce biomass-degrading enzymes and natural products that are important to harness for several biotechnology applications. Although progress has been made in the development of methods for extracting nucleic acids for genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of these fungi, most studies are limited in that they do not sample multiple fungal growth phases in batch culture. In this study, we establish a method to harvest RNA from fungal monocultures and fungalâ€“methanogen co-cultures, and also determine an optimal time frame for high-quality RNA extraction from anaerobic fungi. Based on RNA quality and quantity targets, the optimal time frame in which to harvest anaerobic fungal monocultures and fungal-methanogen co-cultures for RNA extraction was 2-5 days of growth post-inoculation. When grown on cellulose, the fungal strain Anaeromyces robustus cocultivated with the methanogen Methanobacterium bryantii upregulated genes encoding fungal carbohydrate-active enzymes and other cellulosome components relative to fungal monocultures during this time frame, but expression patterns changed at 24-hour intervals throughout the fungal growth phase. These results demonstrate the importance of establishing methods to extract high-quality RNA from anaerobic fungi at multiple time points during batch cultivation.
