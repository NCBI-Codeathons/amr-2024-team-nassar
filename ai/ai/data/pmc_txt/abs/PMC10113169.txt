Surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide produced by microbes belonging to the genus Bacillus, is one of the most effective biosurfactants available in many industrial fields. However, its low production and high cost have intensively constrained its commercial applications. In this review, we first summarize the molecular structure, biological properties, beneficial roles and potential applications of surfactin in the fields of medical care and food safety, highlighting the great medical and commercial values of making its industrial production into reality. Further, genetic regulation for surfactin biosynthesis and advanced strategies for enhancing its microbial production, including optimizing fermentation conditions, rational genetic engineering and synthetic biology combined with metabolic engineering approaches, are elucidated. Finally, prospects for improving surfactin biosynthesis are discussed, and the establishment of suitable chassis hosts for exogenous production of surfactin might serve as an important strategy in future research.
