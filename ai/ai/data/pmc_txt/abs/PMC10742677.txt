Pathogenic biofilm formation within food processing industries raises a serious public health and safety concern, and places burdens on the economy. Biofilm formation on equipment surfaces is a rather complex phenomenon, wherein multiple steps are involved in bacterial biofilm formation. In this review we discuss the stages of biofilm formation, the existing literature on the impact of surface properties and shear stress on biofilms, types of bioreactors, and antimicrobial coatings. The review underscores the significance of prioritizing biofilm prevention strategies as a first line of defense, followed by control measures. Utilizing specific biofilm eradication strategies as opposed to a uniform approach is crucial because biofilms exhibit different behavioral outcomes even amongst the same species when the environmental conditions change. This review is geared towards biofilm researchers and food safety experts, and seeks to derive insights into the scope of biofilm formation, prevention, and control. The use of suitable bioreactors is paramount to understanding the mechanisms of biofilm formation. The findings provide useful information to researchers involved in bioreactor selection for biofilm investigation, and food processors in surfaces with novel antimicrobial coatings, which provide minimal bacterial attachment.
