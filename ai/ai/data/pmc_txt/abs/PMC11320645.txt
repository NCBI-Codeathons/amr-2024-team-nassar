 Fungi have historically been the source of numerous important
medicinal
compounds, but full exploitation of their genetic potential for drug
development has been hampered in traditional discovery paradigms.
Here we describe a radically different approach, top-down drug discovery
(TD3), starting with a massive digital search through a
database of over 100,000 fully genomicized fungi to identify loci
encoding molecules with a predetermined human target. We exemplify
TD3 by the selection of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
as targets and the discovery of two molecules, 1 and 2, which inhibit therapeutically important human CDKs. 1 and 2 exhibit a remarkable mechanism, forming
a site-selective covalent bond to the CDK active site Lys. We explored
the structureâ€“activity relationship via semi- and total synthesis,
generating an analog, 43, with improved kinase selectivity,
bioavailability, and efficacy. This work highlights the power of TD3 to identify mechanistically and structurally novel molecules
for the development of new medicines.
