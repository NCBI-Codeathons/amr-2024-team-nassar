Gliotoxin is an important epipolythiodioxopiperazine, which was biosynthesized by the gli gene cluster in Aspergillus genus. However, the regulatory mechanism of gliotoxin biosynthesis remains unclear. In this study, a novel Zn2Cys6 transcription factor DcGliZ that is responsible for the regulation of gliotoxin biosynthesis from the deep-sea-derived fungus Dichotomomyces cejpii was identified. DcGliZ was expressed in Escherichia coli and effectively purified from inclusion bodies by refolding. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrated that purified DcGliZ can bind to gliG, gliM, and gliN promoter regions in the gli cluster. Furthermore, the binding kinetics and affinity of DcGliZ protein with different promoters were measured by surface plasmon resonance assays, and the results demonstrated the significant interaction of DcGliZ with the gliG, gliM, and gliN promoters. These new findings would lay the foundation for the elucidation of future gliotoxin biosynthetic regulation mechanisms in D. cejpii.
