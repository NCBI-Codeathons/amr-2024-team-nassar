Secondary metabolites are key components in microbial ecology by mediating interactions between bacteria and their environment, neighboring species or host organisms. Bioactivities can be beneficial for both interaction partners or provide a competitive advantage only for the producer. Colonizers of confined habitats such as biofilms are known as prolific producers of a great number of bioactive secondary metabolites and are a potential source for novel compounds. We investigated the strain Paracoccus marcusii CP157, which originates from the biofilm on the carapace of a shell disease-affected Cancer pagurus specimen, for its potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites. Its closed genome contains 22 extrachromosomal elements and several gene clusters potentially involved in biosynthesis of bioactive polyketides, bacteriocins, and non-ribosomal peptides. Culture extracts of CP157 showed antagonistic activities against bacteria from different phyla, but also against microalgae and crustacean larvae. Different HPLC-fractions of CP157 culture extracts had antibacterial properties, indicating that several bioactive compounds are produced by CP157. The bioactive extract contains several small, antibacterial compounds that partially withstand elevated temperatures, extreme pH values and exposure to proteolytic enzymes, providing high stability toward environmental conditions in the natural habitat of CP157. Further, screening of 17 Paracoccus spp. revealed that antimicrobial activity, hemolysis and production of N-acyl homoserine lactones are common features within the genus. Taking into account the large habitat diversity and phylogenetic distance of the tested strains, we hypothesize that bioactive secondary metabolites play a central role in the ecology of Paracoccus spp. in their natural environments.
