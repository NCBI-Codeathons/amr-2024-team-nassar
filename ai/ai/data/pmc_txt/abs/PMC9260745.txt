In this work, an Fe3O4/Cu/CuO (FC) antibacterial nano-agent was synthesized in a “one-pot” approach using copper sulfate and ferric chloride as raw materials, and it was studied using TEM, XRD, XPS, UV-vis, and VSM methods. The antibacterial activity and mechanism of FC were studied, using a commercially available Bordeaux mixture as a control. The effects of an FC on mung bean development and its toxicity to human mammary epithelial cells were also investigated. The results revealed that FC could break the cell walls of E. coli and S. aureus, quadrupling the antibacterial activity of the Bordeaux combination. Furthermore, it was shown that FC might improve the germination, root development, and chlorophyll content of mung bean seeds while being 1/8 as hazardous to human mammary epithelial cells as the Bordeaux combination. The as-prepared FC can replace the Bordeaux combination in the management of agroforestry pathogens.
