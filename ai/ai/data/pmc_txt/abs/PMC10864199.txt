Summary Rhizosphere dwelling microorganism such as Bacillus spp. are helpful for crop growth. However, these functions are adversely affected by long-term synthetic fertilizer application. We developed a modified CRISPR/Cas9 system using non-specific single-guide RNAs to disrupt the genome-wide cis-acting catabolite-responsive elements (cres) in a wild-type Bacillus pumilus strain, which conferred dual plant-benefit properties. Most of the mutations occurred around imperfectly matched cis-acting elements (cre-like sites) in genes that are mainly involved in carbon and secondary metabolism pathways. The comparative metabolomics and transcriptome results revealed that carbon is likely transferred to some pigments, such as riboflavin, carotenoid, and lycopene, or non-ribosomal peptides, such as siderophore, surfactin, myxochelin, and bacilysin, through the pentose phosphate and amino acid metabolism pathways. Collectively, these findings suggested that the mutation of global cre-like sequences in the genome might alter carbon flow, thereby allowing beneficial biological interactions between the rhizobacteria and plants.
