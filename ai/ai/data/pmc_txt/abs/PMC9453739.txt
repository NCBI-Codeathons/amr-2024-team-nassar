 The pairing of analytical chemistry with genomic techniques
represents
a new wave in natural product chemistry. With an increase in the availability
of sequencing and assembly of microbial genomes, interrogation into
the biosynthetic capability of producers with valuable secondary metabolites
is possible. However, without the development of robust, accessible,
and medium to high throughput tools, the bottleneck in pairing metabolic
potential and compound isolation will continue. Several innovative
approaches have proven useful in the nascent stages of microbial genome-informed
drug discovery. Here, we consider a number of these approaches which
have led to prioritization of strain targets and have mitigated rediscovery
rates. Likewise, we discuss integration of principles of comparative
evolutionary studies and retrobiosynthetic predictions to better understand
biosynthetic mechanistic details and link genome sequence to structure.
Lastly, we discuss advances in engineering, chemistry, and molecular
networking and other computational approaches that are accelerating
progress in the field of omic-informed natural product drug discovery.
Together, these strategies enhance the synergy between cutting edge
omics, chemical characterization, and computational technologies that
pitch the discovery of natural products with pharmaceutical and other
potential applications to the crest of the wave where progress is
ripe for rapid advances.
