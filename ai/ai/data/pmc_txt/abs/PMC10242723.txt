Significance This work demonstrates the coordination of global adaptive chromosomal rearrangement and transformation of metabolism in different growth phases, describes the interplay of local chromosomal structure and transcription of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), and applies the potential three dimension (3D) regulation mechanism to realize the high production of target natural products. Our study will provide some insight into the prokaryotic chromosomal organization and transcriptional regulation and offer guidelines to increase the production of natural products. The soil-dwelling filamentous bacteria, Streptomyces, is widely known for its ability to produce numerous bioactive natural products. Despite many efforts toward their overproduction and reconstitution, our limited understanding of the relationship between the host’s chromosome three dimension (3D) structure and the yield of the natural products escaped notice. Here, we report the 3D chromosome organization and its dynamics of the model strain, Streptomyces coelicolor, during the different growth phases. The chromosome undergoes a dramatic global structural change from primary to secondary metabolism, while some biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) form special local structures when highly expressed. Strikingly, transcription levels of endogenous genes are found to be highly correlated to the local chromosomal interaction frequency as defined by the value of the frequently interacting regions (FIREs). Following the criterion, an exogenous single reporter gene and even complex BGC can achieve a higher expression after being integrated into the chosen loci, which may represent a unique strategy to activate or enhance the production of natural products based on the local chromosomal 3D organization.
