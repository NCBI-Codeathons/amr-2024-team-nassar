Gliotoxin is a fungal secondary metabolite with impact on health and agriculture since it might act as virulence factor and contaminate human and animal food. Homologous gliotoxin (GT) gene clusters are spread across a number of fungal species although if they produce GT or other related epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) remains obscure. Using bioinformatic tools, we have identified homologous gli gene clusters similar to the A. fumigatus GT gene cluster in several fungal species. In silico study led to in vitro confirmation of GT and Bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin (bmGT) production in fungal strain cultures by HPLC detection. Despite we selected most similar homologous gli gene cluster in 20 different species, GT and bmGT were only detected in section Fumigati species and in a Trichoderma virens Q strain. Our results suggest that in silico gli homology analyses in different fungal strains to predict GT production might be only informative when accompanied by analysis about mycotoxin production in cell cultures.
