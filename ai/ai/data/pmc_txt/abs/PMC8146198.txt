Raffaelea lauricola is the causative agent of laurel wilt, a devastating disease of lauraceous trees. R. lauricola is also an obligate nutritional symbiont of several ambrosia beetle species who act as vectors for the pathogen. Here, we sought to establish the baseline “phenome” of R. lauricola with knowledge concerning its metabolic capability, expanding our understanding of how these processes are impacted by environmental and host nutrients. Phenotypic screening using a microarray of over one thousand compounds was used to generate a detailed profile of R. lauricola substrate utilization and chemical sensitivity. These data revealed (i) relatively restricted carbon utilization, (ii) broad sulfur and phosphate utilization, and (iii) pH and osmotic sensitivities that could be rescued by specific compounds. Additional growth profiling on fatty acids revealed toxicity on C10 substrates and lower, with robust growth on C12–C18 fatty acids. Conditions for lipid droplet (LD) visualization and LD dynamics were examined using a series of lipid dyes. These data provide unique insights regarding R. lauricola metabolism and physiology, and identify distinct patterns of substrate usage and sensitivity which likely reflect important aspects of the host-microbe interface and can be exploited for the development of strategies for mitigating the spread of laurel wilt.
