The appropriate regulation of T cell activity under inflammatory conditions is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. Salinosporamide A discovered as a self-resistance product from the marine bacterium Salinospora tropica, has been used as a potent proteasome inhibitor (PI). Although PIs have been developed as novel therapeutics for autoimmune diseases, due to their immunosuppressive effect, whether salinosporamide A inhibits T cell activation remains unknown. The current study finds that salinosporamide A is not cytotoxic, but controls T cell proliferation. Results from our cell cycle arrest analysis revealed that salinosporamide A leads to cell cycle arrest and regulates the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases. Under activated conditions, salinosporamide A abrogated T cell activation by T cell receptor-mediated stimulation, in which the production of cytokines was inhibited by pretreatment with salinosporamide A. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the regulation of T cell activation by salinosporamide A is mediated by suppressing the MAPK pathway. Therefore, our results suggest that salinosporamide A effectively suppresses T cell activation through regulating T cell proliferation and the cell cycle and provides great insight into the development of novel therapeutics for autoimmune diseases or graft-versus-host disease.
