Endophytes is a kind of microorganism resource with great potential medicinal value. The interactions between endophytes and host not only promote the growth and development of each other but also drive the biosynthesis of many new medicinal active substances. In this review, we summarized recent reports related to the interactions between endophytes and hosts, mainly regarding the research progress of endophytes affecting the growth and development of host plants, physiological stress and the synthesis of new compounds. Then, we also discussed the positive effects of multiomics analysis on the interactions between endophytes and their hosts, as well as the application and development prospects of metabolites synthesized by symbiotic interactions. This review may provide a reference for the further development and utilization of endophytes and the study of their interactions with their hosts.
