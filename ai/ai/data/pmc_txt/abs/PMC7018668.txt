Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, leading to a large global cancer burden. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its high-affinity receptor, mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-Met), are closely related to the onset, progression, and metastasis of multiple tumors. The HGF/c-Met axis is involved in cell proliferation, movement, differentiation, invasion, angiogenesis, and apoptosis by activating multiple downstream signaling pathways. In this review, we focus on the function of the HGF/c-Met axis in HCC. The HGF/c-Met axis promotes the onset, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of HCC. Moreover, it can serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a therapeutic target for HCC. In addition, it is closely related to drug resistance during HCC treatment.
