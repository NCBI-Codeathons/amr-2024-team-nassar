 Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide
translocase
(MraYAA) from Aquifex aeolicus is the binding target for the nucleotide antibiotic muraymycin D2
(MD2). MraYAA in the presence of the MD2 ligand has been
crystallized and released, while the interactions between the ligand
and active-site residues remain less quantitatively and qualitatively
defined. We characterized theoretically the key residues involved
in noncovalent interactions with MD2 in the MraYAA active
site. We applied the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and natural
bond orbital analyses based on the density functional theory method
on the solved crystal structure of MraY with the MD2 to quantitatively
estimate the intermolecular interactions. The obtained results revealed
the presence of multiple hydrogen bonds in the investigated active
site with strength ranging from van der Waals to covalent limits.
Lys70, Asp193, Gly194, Asp196, Gly264, Ala321, Gln305, and His325
are key active-site residues interacting with MD2. Conventional and
unconventional hydrogen bonds in addition with charge–dipole
and dipole–dipole interactions contribute significantly to
stabilize the MD2 binding to the MraYAA active site. It
was also found that water molecules inside the active site have substantial
effects on its structure stability through hydrogen-bonding interactions
with MD2 and the interacting residues.
