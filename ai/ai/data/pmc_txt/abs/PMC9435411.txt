Antibiotics have been overused and misused for preventive and therapeutic purposes. Specifically, antibiotics are frequently used as growth promoters for improving productivity and performance of food-producing animals such as pigs, cattle, and poultry. The increasing use of antibiotics has been of great concern worldwide due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Food-producing animals are considered reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and residual antibiotics that transfer from the farm through the table. The accumulation of residual antibiotics can lead to additional antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Therefore, this review evaluates the risk of carriage and spread of antibiotic resistance through food chain and the potential impact of antibiotic use in food-producing animals on food safety. This review also includes in-depth discussion of promising antibiotic alternatives such as vaccines, immune modulators, phytochemicals, antimicrobial peptides, probiotics, and bacteriophages.
