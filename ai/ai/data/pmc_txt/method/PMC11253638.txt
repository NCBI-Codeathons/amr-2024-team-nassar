MATERIALS AND METHODS Microbial strains and culture conditions The soil-borne bacterium B. brevis HK544 strain was isolated from the soil at Daejeon, South Korea, and deposited as a patent microorganism to the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (KACC, Jeonju, South Korea; No. KACC 81093BP). The bacterium was maintained on tryptic soy broth (TSB; BD Difco, San Jose, CA, USA) agar plate at 30°C. For the in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity, the F. graminearum wild-type strain Z-3639 was used as a target fungal pathogen and grown in complete medium (CM) or potato dextrose broth (PDB; BD Difco) supplemented with 1.5% agar as needed (1). Conidia from F. graminearum were induced in a carboxymethyl cellulose medium (50). A minimal medium including 5 mM agmatine (MMA) was used to evaluate trichothecene production (51). All microbial strains used in this study were stored in 20% glycerol at −80°C. Mitochondrial respiratory inhibition assay The inhibitory activity of mitochondrial respiration was investigated using the method described by Han et al. (9). Briefly, the growth inhibition of S. cerevisiae A-139 treated with CF or EB1 was compared in two different media: YG (1% yeast extract and 2% glucose) and NFYG (1% yeast extract and 1% glycerol). After 24-h incubation, the optical density (OD600) of each well was measured using a microplate reader (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and the growth inhibition (%) of the A-139 strain was calculated as follows: [1 − (OD600 of treatment/OD600 of control)] × 100. The QoI fungicide kresoxim-methyl and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Measurement of ATP production To measure the ATP production of F. graminearum treated with the HK544 CF, a conidial suspension (5 × 107 conidia/mL) was inoculated into 50 mL of PDB. After 24 h incubation, HK544 CF was added to the cultures at a final concentration of 0.1% and 1%, respectively. After 1- and 4-h incubation, mycelium was harvested and ground in liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar. ATP production in the ground mycelia was determined with the ATP Determination Kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Fungal tissue (10 mg) was reacted with 1.25 µg/mL firefly luciferase, 50 µM D-luciferin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1× reaction buffer. After a 15-min incubation, luminescence was measured by the BioTek Synergy LX multimode reader (Agilent Technologies). Isolation and identification of active compounds from HK544 CF The HK544 strain was inoculated into 400 mL of TSB medium in a 2 L-Erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 25°C for 3 days with shaking (150 r/min). A total of 4 L of HK544 culture broth was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min and passed through Whatman No.1 filter paper (Maidstone, UK). The HK544 CF was applied onto a Diaion HP-20 column (5 × 30 cm; Mitsubishi Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) with a stepwise gradient elution of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% aqueous acetone to give F1–F6. The 60% aqueous methanol fraction (2.0 g) exhibiting the antifungal activity was subjected to a reversed-phase flash column chromatography packed with LiChroprep RP-18 (40–63 µm; Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) and eluted with 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% aqueous methanol (containing 0.1% formic acid). An active fraction F41 (200 mg) was further purified by a Sephadex LH 20 column (16 × 100 cm; Merck). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min with deionized water. Finally, the purified compound HKC1 (117 mg) was obtained and kept at −20°C until further analysis. The chemical structure of HKC1 was determined by spectroscopic analyses and comparisons with values in previous literature (23). The ESI-MS data were recorded on a single-quadruple mass spectrometer (Acquity QDa; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). All nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterium oxide (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA, USA) at 25°C on the Bruker Advance 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). In vitro antifungal activity assay For the inhibitory effect of EB1 on the conidial germination of F. graminearum, EB1 dissolved in DMSO was added to the microplate wells containing a conidial suspension (5 × 105 conidia/mL of PDB). After a 10 h incubation at 25°C, the number of germinated conidia was counted by microscopic observation in 100 conidia. To investigate the mycelial growth inhibition of EB1, a mycelial disk (5 mm in diameter) of F. graminearum was inoculated onto CM supplemented with different concentrations of EB1, and then, the radial growth of F. graminearum was measured at 5 dpi. To determine the MIC values of CF and EB1 against F. graminearum, we used the broth microdilution method as previously described (52). Briefly, a conidial suspension (1 × 104 conidia/mL of PDB) of F. graminearum was added to the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate, and then, EB1 stock solutions dissolved in DMSO were added at an initial concentration of 25 µg/mL by twofold serial dilutions. The 1% DMSO was used for a negative control. After incubation for 24 h at 25°C, the MIC was determined by visual examination and corresponded to the lowest concentration that caused complete growth inhibition. Microscopic observation The F. graminearum mycelia grown on CM containing the HK544 CF were observed under an FEI Quanta 250 FEG scanning electron microscope (Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 10 kV. To investigate the effect of EB1 on F. graminearum membrane permeability, the conidia were incubated with EB1 (12.5 µg/mL) for 4 h and then stained with 2 µM propidium iodide for 1 h. As a positive control, F. graminearum conidia was treated with 70% aqueous ethanol. Images were captured on an Olympus BS53 microscope (Münster, Germany) with a filter set of 494 nm/515 nm (excitation/emission wavelength). Protein synthesis assay To investigate the effects of EB1 on protein synthesis in fungal cells, we evaluated the initial protein level using a Click-iT HPG Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Synthesis Assay kit (Thermo Fisher, Massachusetts, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, a conidial suspension (1  ×  106 conidia/mL of CM) of F. graminearum was treated with EB1 (or cycloheximide) with 4 h incubation. After 1 h-additional incubation with HPG for 90  min, the fungal cells were fixed using a 3.7% formaldehyde solution and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. The Click-iT reaction buffer containing Alexa Fluor dye with the azide moiety was added to the samples and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. After washing with the Click-iT reaction rinse buffer, the samples were stained with 1× HCS NuclearMask blue stain solution, and the newly synthesized proteins were examined by an Olympus BS53 microscope (Münster, Germany) with a consistent exposure time. For the quantification, the fluorescence signal intensity was determined using the BioTek Synergy LX multimode reader (Agilent Technologies). Transcriptome analysis The F. graminearum Z-3639 strain was grown in 50 mL of CM at 25°C with shaking for 72 h and then incubated with EB1 (10 µg/mL). After 1-, 2-, and 4-h incubation, the fungal mycelia were collected and washed twice with distilled water before being ground in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted with an Easy-Spin Total RNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, South Korea) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and RNA quality was assessed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The total RNA was subjected to RNA-Seq library preparation using a TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Each library from three biological replicates per treatment (total 12 libraries) was sequenced for 101 bp paired-end reads with an Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform (Illumina) by Macrogen in Seoul, South Korea. The resulting sequences were analyzed using the Galaxy web-based platform. Trimming of reads was conducted using Trimmomatic (Galaxy version 0.38.1) (53), and the paired-end reads of each sample were aligned to the F. graminearum reference genome sequence using RNA STAR (Galaxy version 2.7.10b) (54). Gene expression quantification was computed using featureCounts (Galaxy version 2.0.3) (55), and the analysis of differential gene expression was performed using the DESeq2 R package (56). Enrichment analysis was performed in DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (57). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted using an Easy-Spin Total RNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) with the CFX Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad). An endogenous housekeeping gene ubh (FGSG_01231, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase) of F. graminearum was used as an internal control for normalization (58). Relative expression levels were calculated through the 2−ΔΔCT method (59). The experiments were repeated twice, with three replicates for each. Primers used in the qRT-PCR are listed in Table S3. Generation of knockout strain Gene knockout constructs were prepared by double-joint PCR as previously described (60). Briefly, the fungal genomic DNA of Z-3639 was extracted from freeze-dried mycelia powder according to the Fusarium laboratory manual (1). The 5′ and 3′ flanking regions (approximately 1.5 kb) of a target gene were amplified from F. graminearum gDNA and then were fused into a hygromycin resistance cassette (Hyg) amplified from pGEM-T_Hyg (61). The resulting constructs were transformed into the Z-3639 protoplasts using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated transformation (50). Transformants grown on CM medium containing hygromycin were subjected to PCR-based screening using specific primer pairs. Primers used in the generation of knockout strains are listed in Table S3. EB1-induced haploinsufficiency analysis DIH assay was performed by using S. pombe heterozygous deletion mutants from Bioneer (Daejeon, South Korea) based on the measurement of cell growth inhibition (62). Briefly, S. pombe cells were grown at 30°C in a complete YES medium containing 0.5% yeast extract, 2% glucose, and various supplements as described (63). The GI50 value of EB1 was determined against the S. pombe wild-type strain (SP286; h+/h+, ade6-M210/ade6-M216, ura4-D18/ura4-D18, leu1-32/leu1-32). Spore suspensions (1 × 106 cells/mL of YES medium) of a mitochondrial-related functional group subset, including 342 heterozygous deletion mutants of S. pombe, were added to the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Then, the EB1 stock solution dissolved in DMSO was added at a final concentration of 80 µM. As a control, we used a YES medium containing 0.06% DMSO. The microtiter plates were incubated at 30°C for 20 h. The fitness value that represents the growth inhibitory potency of EB1 at the GI50 dose in each deletion mutant was calculated by dividing the cell mass (A600) of the DMSO control with the one for the treated drug. Gene information on S. pombe was obtained from the PomBase database (64). FHB disease control efficacy To investigate the disease control efficacy of HK544 CF and EB1, the spray inoculation method was used with wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Eunpa) that was grown in a glasshouse at 25°C ± 5°C for 4 weeks (65). Briefly, mid-anthesis stage wheat heads were sprayed with HK544 CF and EB1 dissolved in sterile water using a hand-held atomizer; both samples contained 0.025% Tween 20 solution as a wetting agent. The sterile water alone served as a negative control. After the treated wheat plants were air dried for 24 h, 20 of each treated wheat head were sprayed with a conidial suspension (1 × 106 conidia/mL) of F. graminearum containing 0.025% Tween 20 solution. The inoculated plants were kept in the humidified chamber (25°C; 12 h photoperiod) for 3 days and then moved to a glasshouse at 25°C ± 5°C. After 2 days of additional incubation, we recorded a percentage of the wheat head surface showing FHB symptoms. The FHB disease control efficacy was calculated with the following equation: control efficacy (%) = 100 × (1 − B/A), where A is the mean of the lesion area (%) on the wheat head of the control plants and B is the mean of lesion area (%) on the wheat head of the treated plants (65). Trichothecene analysis A conidial suspension (1 × 106 conidia/mL) was incubated in MMA medium supplemented with or without HK544 CF at 25°C under stationary growth conditions to measure trichothecene production. Trichothecenes were extracted from 7-day-old MMA cultures with an ethyl acetate-methanol mixture (4:1, vol/vol) as described previously (49). Briefly, the extracts were dried and derivatized with Sylon BTZ (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Sequentially, the derivatized samples were mixed with an equal volume of n-hexane and distilled water. Then, the hexane layer was analyzed for trichothecene production using a Shimadzu QP2020 gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Quantification was performed by comparing the peak areas of the samples with those of external standards of DON and 15-ADON (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and then normalized by biomass. Synergetic effect assay As previously described, a checkerboard assay was performed to determine synergism between EB1 and respiratory inhibition compounds (66). Briefly, EB1 and each inhibitor dissolved in DMSO were added using twofold serial dilutions in the x-axis and y-axis of a 96-well microtiter plate, respectively, containing an F. graminearum conidial suspension (1 × 104 conidia/mL). Rotenone (complex I), TTFA (complex II), antimycin A (complex III), and KCN (complex IV) were used as specific inhibitors for ETC complexes, and fenazaquin and fluopyram were used as chemical fungicides targeting complex I and II, respectively. As a negative control, we used a 1% DMSO treatment. After an 18 h incubation, the OD600 value of each well was measured using a microplate reader (Bio-rad), and the growth inhibition (%) was calculated as follows: [1 − (OD600 of combined treatment/OD600 of negative control)] × 100. Obtained data were analyzed with SynergyFinder (version 1.6.1), and the synergy score was evaluated based on the ZIP method (67, 68). The results were interpreted by the ZIP scores as synergism, >10; indifference, −10 – 10; and antagonism, <−10 (68). Statistical analysis All experiments were repeated at least two times with three replicates each unless otherwise noted. Data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.1.2 software. A two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used to compare the two groups. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). For FHB disease control efficacy, data were subjected to one-way ANOVA, and the means of the treatments were separated by Duncan’s multiple range test (P < 0.05). Significant differences were indicated with different small letters in each bar.
