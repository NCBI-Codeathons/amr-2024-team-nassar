Materials and Methods Plant growth and single-leaflet grafting of TYLCV and ToCV To investigate the response of tomato plants to the combined effects of virus and drought stresses, we used susceptible Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Money Maker (MK, UK) and Shalala (SH, Azerbaijan) cultivars. The Money Maker seeds were obtained from the Institute of Biotechnology at Ankara University, while the Shalala seeds were obtained from the seed bank of the Research Institute of Crop Husbandry of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Azerbaijan Republic. The tomato seeds were germinated in plastic vials containing a mixture of peat, perlite, and vermiculite. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cultivars were grown in an insect-free growth chamber with a temperature of 26/20°C (day/night) and a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle, maintaining a relative humidity of 60–70% (Çevik et al., 2019). At the 3–4 true leaf stage, the tomato seedlings (Money Maker and Shalala MK and SH) were used as recipient plants for the single-leaflet grafting method following the procedure described by Lee et al. (2017). ToCV- and TYLCV-infected tomato plants were used as sources for grafting inoculation. Leaf samples for grafting were collected from greenhouses located in the Kumluca region of Antalya, Turkey, in June (Fig. 1). The identification of the viruses in source plants was confirmed using duplex PCR (for TYLCV) and nested PCR (for ToCV) with specific primer pairs (for TYLCV, 5′-CCG GTG TTG TGC GTT GTG TTA G-3′ and 5′-TGA AGG AGC AGT GTY TGY TG-3′; For ToCV, 5′-GG(G/T)TT(A/G)GA(G/T)TT(C/T)GGTACTAC-3′, 5′-CC(G/T) CCACCAAA(A/G)TCGTA-3′, and 5′-GG TTTGGATTTTGGTACTACTAGT-3′, 5′-AAACTGCCTGCATAAAGTCT C-3′) before grafting inoculation. For grafting, a small incision was made on the stem of the recipient seedling by removing the first leaf at the node (Fig. 2). The leaf axil of the identified diseased plant samples was used as inoculum for grafting. The inoculum was applied to the recipient plant by making a cut on the recipient plant with a lancet. Grafting clips were used to ensure successful grafting. The newly grafted tomato seedlings were kept in a shaded, air-conditioned, insect-free greenhouse with temperatures of 26°C during the day and 20°C at night. The grafted leaflets were misted with water multiple times a day to prevent wilting. The grafted plants were maintained under these conditions for four weeks after grafting. Grafting leaflets collected from virus-free healthy tomato plants were included as a negative control (mock). Four independent sets of the grafting inoculation experiment were conducted, and after four weeks, the grafted tissues were examined (Fig. 3). Four weeks after grafting, nucleic acids were extracted from the upper systemic leaves of the successfully grafted recipient tomato plants. These extracts were subjected to duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR using the specific primer pairs mentioned above to detect TYLCV and ToCV, respectively. Success rate of grafting was 98.5% for TYLCV and 85.3% for ToCV after 28 dpi (Çevik et al., 2019; Pathirana and McKenzie, 2005). The experiment was performed with three biological and technical replicates. Drought treatment Tomato seedlings (MK and SH) were transplanted into 2-liter pots filled with standard soil three weeks after sowing. They were initially irrigated with tap water for one week and then water supply was ceased. No additional minerals or fertilizers were applied throughout the experiment. Growth chamber with a temperature range of 20°C (dark period) and 26°C (daylight) were maintained for both uninfected and virus-infected tomato plants. Subsequently, the plants were divided into four groups: healthy (mock-inoculated) and watered (HW), healthy and exposed to drought (HD), virus-infected and watered (VW), and virus-infected and exposed to drought (VD). These four groups of plants were further categorized into two cultivars (MK and SH) and were infected with TYLCV and ToCV, representing two different virus isolates. The control group consisted of mock-inoculated plants grafted with leaflet samples obtained from healthy tomato plants of the MK and SH cultivars. VW and VD plants were infected with TYLCV and ToCV, respectively, using the grafting method. At 4 weeks post-infection (wpi) (Çevik et al., 2019), the VD tomatoes were subjected to drought stress along with the HD group. To ensure long-term growth under water deficit conditions and prevent early plant mortality, 50 ml of water was provided to each pot at 10, 17, and 24 days of drought application (25 d) (Mishra et al., 2022). Generally, the drought-applied plants were watered on the 10th, 17th, and 24th days of the experiment to maintain long-term stress conditions. The experiments were repeated three times, each consisting of four groups of plants containing 15 seedlings. TYLCV and ToCV grafting confirmation with Duplex and nested PCR Duplex PCR For the confirmation of TYLCV, the AV632, AC950, and AC1048 primers were utilized to amplify the coat protein (CP) gene of the viruses, following the protocols described by Brown et al. (1996) and Martinéz-Culebras et al. (2001). Total DNA extraction from 50 mg of fresh leaf tissue was performed using CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) solution, following the protocol described by Aboul-Maaty and Oraby (2019). The resulting DNA pellet was resuspended in Dnase-Purity solution. The concentration and purity of the extracted DNA were determined using a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For the duplex PCR reaction, a total volume of 25 μl was prepared. The reaction mix contained a final concentration of 1× Taq buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.15 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each primer (AV632, AV950, and AC1048), 1.24 U of Taq DNA polymerase, and 100 ng of DNA template (Louro et al., 2000). The duplex PCR reaction was carried out under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 65°C for 1 min, and elongation at 72°C for 1 min. A final elongation step was performed at 72°C for 10 min. Details of the PCR reaction conditions can be found in Table 1. Nested PCR Total RNA extraction was performed using the Tri Reagent solution (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Approximately 30–50 mg of fresh leaf tissue was used for RNA extraction. The resulting RNA pellet was resuspended in Rnase-Purity solution, and the concentration and purity of the extracted RNA samples were determined using a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). To confirm ToCV in grafted tomatoes, a two-step PCR approach was employed, consisting of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested PCR. The first step involved RT-PCR using the BC-36 and BC-37 primers, as well as a primer specific to the highly conserved heat shock protein (HSP 70) region, designed according to the method outlined by Dovas et al. (2002). For the nested PCR, four different specific primer pairs (BC-36 and BC-37) designed by Dovas et al. (2002) were used. Information of the primers can be found in Table 1. For RT-PCR, 5 μl of RNA samples were mixed with 1 μl of primer and 6 μl of water, and the mixture was incubated at 65°C for 5 min. The samples were then denatured in a PCR machine and kept on ice for 5 min. In a separate tube, 4 μl of 5× reaction buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 250 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 50 mM DTT), 1 μl of RNase inhibitor, 2 μl of 10 mM dNTPs, and 1 μl of reverse transcriptase were added. The reaction mixture was then combined with the denatured RNA samples. The RT-PCR reaction was performed at 25°C for 5 min, followed by 42°C for 60 min, and a final step at 70°C for 5 min. The cDNA obtained from the RT-PCR reaction was used as a template for PCR amplification of the approximately 587 bp region using specific primers targeting the conserved regions of the ToCV HSP70 gene, and Taq DNA polymerase enzyme was used for the PCR reaction. For the PCR reaction, a mixture was prepared consisting of 2.5 μl of 10× PCR buffer solution (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 500 mM KCl), 1.5 μl of 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μl of 10 mM dNTPs, 4 μl of 20 pmol primer BC36F, 2 μl of 20 pmol primer BC37R, 0.25 μl of Taq DNA Polymerase, and 11.75 μl of water. To this mixture, 22.5 μl of the PCR mixture and 2.5 μl of the DNA template were added to the PCR tube. The PCR reaction conditions included an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 43°C for 30 s, and elongation at 72°C for 1 min. A final extension step was performed at 72°C for 5 min. For the nested PCR, a second PCR reaction was performed using specific primers (0.5 μl of 20 pmol primer BC40F and 0.5 μl of 20 pmol primer BC41R) and the same PCR conditions as the first PCR. The amplification products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light using a Gel Documentation imaging device (Uvitek, UK). The intensity of viral presence within a plant can exhibit variations based on factors such as the plant’s developmental stage, climatic conditions, or the stage of infection. Consequently, in situations where virus symptoms or intensity are minimal, the utilization of nested RT-PCR, a highly sensitive method, is recommended (Dovas et al., 2002). Although the CP gene is not commonly employed for virus identification, the nested RT-PCR technique targeting the HSP70 gene, which is specific to this virus family and possesses a highly conserved sequence, successfully identified the virus. Previous studies (Dovas et al., 2002; Moriones and Navas-Castillo, 2000; Papayiannis et al., 2011) have effectively employed RT-PCR methodologies targeting the HSP70 gene. The present study demonstrates that the HSP70 gene can serve as an alternative to the CP gene for diagnosing ToCV. For the nested PCR procedure, a mixture was prepared by combining 2.5 μl of 10× PCR buffer solution (comprising 100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.8], 500 mM KCl), 1.5 μl of 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μl of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μl of a mixture containing 20 pmol of primer BC40F and 20 pmol of primer BC41R, and 0.25 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (0.5 U), with a final volume of 18.25 μl of water. Each PCR tube received 24 μl of the prepared mixture and 1 μl of DNA. The PCR amplification protocol commenced with an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 3 min. This was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s. Finally, a 5 min extension step was performed at 72°C. After the amplification, the PCR product corresponding to a 463-base pair (bp) segment of the ToCV HSP70 gene was maintained at 4°C. Subsequently, the PCR products and a 100-bp DNA ladder were separated via electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and visualized under ultraviolet light using a Gel Documentation (Uvitek) imaging device after staining with ethidium bromide. During the RT-PCR testing, symptomatic tomato samples infected with ToCV isolate from the Kumluca region of Antalya were employed as positive controls. Primer design and quantitative (qRT-PCR) expression analysis In the primer design, Solanum lycopersicum cellulose synthase-like protein genes (Gene ID, gene number) were identified with the help of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and then NCBI Primer-BLAST tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer). In the primer validation, pre-optimization reactions were performed at different annealing temperatures and PCR conditions, taking into account the primers, forward and reverse annealing temperatures, using the control cDNA, and the amplifications of the primers were checked. Then, standard curves were generated for each gene/primer to show that each primer was valid. The Roche LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was employed for conducting qRT-PCR experiments (Table 2). A standard curve was generated using six serial dilutions (ranging from 1/10 to 1/100,000) of control cDNA (MCD or SCD) for each primer. For each primer, the standard close were prepared (efficiency and slope values were closed to 2.2 and -3.2, respectively). cDNAs obtained in the nested PCR step were used in qRT-PCR reactions. The qRT-PCR conditions involved an initial pre-incubation of 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 56-57-50-52-58°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min. Prior to loading onto the real-time PCR instrument plates, the cDNAs of the samples were covered with Roche LightCycler 480 Sealing Foil. The samples were prepared using Promega GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Madison, WI, USA) according to the optimized conditions specific to each primer. Three independent biological replicates were used in each experiment. The optimization of Csl-H1, Ces-A2, Csl-D3,2, Csl-D3,1, and Solyc11 primers was performed using qRT-PCR. A 12 μl reaction mixture was prepared, comprising 3 μl of cDNA (500 ng/μl), 1.8–2 μl of forward and reverse primers (10 pmol), and 5 μl of LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche). The amplification program involved an initial polymerase activation step at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at Tm for 10 s, and extension at 72°C for 5 s. To verify the specificity of the qRT-PCR amplification, melt curve analysis was performed by gradually increasing the temperature from 95°C to Tm following the final cycle. Melting curve analysis confirmed the presence of single peaks with no dimers. Optimal temperatures were selected on the Roche LightCycler-LC 480 instrument, and the amplification reactions were carried out according to the specified PCR program conditions. Relative gene expression levels were determined by normalizing the expression of Csl-H1, Ces-A2, Csl-D3,2, Csl-D3,1, and Solyc11 genes with the housekeeping gene Solanum lycopersicum actin-7-like gene (ID: LOC101262163) (Klay et al., 2014). As for technical replicates, we used 3 for each biological sample. The abbreviations used in the qRT-PCR analyses are provided in Table 3. Statistical analysis of quantitative (qRT-PCR) expression analysis The experimental setup was designed according to a completely randomized design as three replicates each of which contains 4–5 leaflets. According to the Ct (cycle threshold) values, the relative expression levels were calculated by using the 2−ΔΔCT (the delta-delta-Ct or ddCt) algorithm (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). Reaction efficiency has been considered as 1 (one). The expression of Csl-H1, Ces-A2, Csl-D3,2, Csl-D3,1 genes was normalized according to the Actin-7-like gene housekeeping gene. Physiological measurements At the conclusion of the experiment, several physiological parameters were assessed as follows. The physiological parameters were analyzed in four groups: TYLCV and ToCV grafted (virus healthy, VH; virus drought, VD), as well as mock-inoculated (healthy watered, HW) and healthy drought (HD) groups, in each of the two cultivars (MK, SH). All experiments were conducted with three biological replicates. The relative water content (RWC) of virus-infected and healthy tomato samples was determined using the method described by Tambussi et al. (2005). To measure the dry biomass of tomato leaves, sections of the same size were prepared from both diseased and healthy leaf samples, and their mass was determined using an electronic scale, following the protocol outlined by Grünzweig et al. (1999). Leaf area measurements were taken for infected and healthy plant samples. The length from the part of the leaf attached to the stem to the tip, as well as the diameter of the widest part, were measured using a ruler. The leaf area was calculated geometrically, in accordance with the method described by Grünzweig et al. (1999). To assess water deficit in the leaves, the initial weight of the leaves was recorded, followed by soaking the leaves in water for 60 min, and finally, the wet weight was measured, as outlined by Shackel (1991). Three independent biological replicates were used in each experiment. The physological parameters were determined using three technical replicates. Statistical analysis of physiological analysis The significance of differences between the control and experimental groups was evaluated using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences in means were considered statistically significant when the P-value was less than 0.05. For each treatment, three different samples were collected and analyzed twice.
