Materials and Methods Mycelial proteomics For shotgun proteomics, mycelia from A. fumigatus ATCC26933 shaking cultures were harvested after 48 h, 200 rpm, 37°C in Aspergillus minimal media (AMM) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A. fumigatus ATCC26933 mycelia were also harvested from shaking cultures grown for 72 h in Czapek-Dox media, 37°C, 200 rpm. Protein was extracted and subjected to trypsin digestion as described [31]. Briefly, frozen mycelia (1 g) were ground in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in 6 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl, 6 M Guanidine-HCl, 10 mM DTT pH 8.6. Extracts were sonicated five times at 10% power, cycle 6 for 10 sec intervals, followed by centrifugation at 10000 g for 10 min at 4°C. DTT (1 M; 10 µl per ml lysate) was added to the supernatants and incubated at 56°C for 30 min. Iodoacetamide (1 M; 55 µl per ml lysate) was added and incubated in the dark for 20 min. Whole cell lysates were dialysed twice against 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Aliquots of denatured protein solutions (100 µl) were digested with trypsin (5 µl; 0.4 µg/µl in 10% (v/v) acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate), overnight at 37°C. Tryptic peptide mixtures were spin-filtered (Agilent Technologies, 0.22 µm cellulose acetate), separated on extended liquid chromatography gradients on a nanoflow Agilent 1200 LC system and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry using an Agilent 6340 Ion Trap LC-MS System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Database searches for identification of proteins were carried out using Spectrum Mill MS Proteomics Workbench (Revision B.04.00.127). Validation criteria were set to (i) maximum of two missed cleavages by trypsin, (ii) fixed modification: carbamidomethylation of cysteines, (iii) variable modifications: oxidation of methionine, (iv) mass tolerance of precursor ions ±2.5 Da and product ions ±0.7 Da were employed and searches were carried out against a protein database of Aspergillus fumigatus strains Af293 (reference strain) and A1163, acquired from [32]. Protein grouping was carried out based on the presence of ≥1 shared peptide. Protein identifications were validated based on fixed thresholds (minimum protein score set to 20), with single peptide identifications requiring a Spectrum Mill score ≥17.0 and SPI >70%. In order to determine the relative hydrophobicity of the identified proteins, the grand average of hydropathy (GRAVY) index was calculated using GRAVY calculator (www.gravy-calculator.de). Using Phobius (http://phobius.cbr.su.se), the number of putative transmembrane regions present in each identified protein was determined. Identified proteins were grouped into functional categories based on the FunCat (Functional Catalogue), GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) annotations, using the FungiFun application (https://www.omnifung.hki-jena.de/FungiFun/) [33]. Detection of Secreted Secondary Metabolites in A. fumigatus Culture supernatants were harvested from A. fumigatus ATCC26933 grown for 48 h in AMM or 72 h in Czapek-Dox, as described above. Organic extractions were carried out using a 1∶1 mixture of chloroform to culture supernatant [34]. Chloroform extracts were dried to completion using a rotary evaporator and resuspended in methanol for LC-MS analysis using an Agilent 6340 Ion Trap LC-MS System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Settings were adjusted to include the detection of singly charged molecules and molecules were separated on an acetonitrile gradient over a 15 min runtime. 2-D and LC-MS/MS The mechanisms involved in gliotoxin-mediated relief of H2O2-induced stress in A. fumigatus ATCC26933 were investigated by comparative 2-D and LC-MS/MS. A. fumigatus ATCC26933 was grown in Sabouraud dextrose media at 200 rpm, 37°C for 24 h prior to addition of one of the following four treatments: (i) Solvent control (500 µl methanol added per 50 ml culture), (ii) Gliotoxin alone (gliotoxin, dissolved in methanol, added to a final concentration of 10 µg/ml), (iii) H2O2 alone (H2O2 added to a final concentration of 2 mM; 500 µl methanol added per 50 ml culture), (iv) Gliotoxin and H2O2 combined (gliotoxin added to a final 10 µg/ml and H2O2 added to final 2 mM). Mycelia (n = 5 biological replicates/treatment) were harvested after 4 h and ground in liquid nitrogen. Crushed mycelia were resuspended in 10% (w/v) TCA and sonicated three times at 10% power, cycle 6, 10 sec. Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 10000 g, 4°C for 10 min. Pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone to remove excess TCA and resuspended in IEF buffer [4]. Protein was separated on pH 4–7 IEF strips, followed by resolution by SDS-PAGE [35], [36]. Colloidal Coomassie staining was carried out on gels, with subsequent protein spot analysis using Progenesis SameSpot software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom). Gels (n = 20; 5 replicates/treatment) from all four treatments were aligned and subsets of treatments were compared. Spots demonstrating significant changes in abundance (p<0.05, fold change ≥1.5) were excised from gels and trypsin digested according to the method described by Shevchenko (2007) [37]. Digested peptides were analysed by LC-MS/MS as described previously, with SpectrumMill used for database searching. Fluorescent Detection of ROS in A. fumigatus A. fumigatus ATCC26933 conidia (4×106 per well, in 6 well plates) were added to Sabouraud liquid media (4 ml/well) and incubated for 24 h at 37°C, static. Each well contained a glass microscope slide. After removal of the top layer of mycelia, H2O2 (2 mM final) only, or with gliotoxin (10 µg/ml final) was added. H2O2 alone acts as a positive control as it is a known ROS inducing agent. Gliotoxin (10 µg/ml final) and an equivalent volume of MeOH were also added individually to separate wells as negative control. Plates were re-incubated 37°C, static, for 30 min, culture supernatants removed and mycelial mats washed once with 4 ml PBS for 5 min. After PBS removal, Sabouraud medium (3 ml) containing 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (2.5 µg/ml; H2DCFDA; Life Technologies) was added to each well followed by incubation 37°C for 40 min, static. After washing twice with PBS (2×20 min each), mycelia were visualised using a fluorescent microscope (GFP filter: Ex/Em: 492–495/517–527 nm). Fluorescence was quantified by measuring Integrated Density Value (IDV) of selected areas from each image (n = 5/treatment) representing subsequent data as means ± standard error. Differences were evaluated using ANOVA, and statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05.
