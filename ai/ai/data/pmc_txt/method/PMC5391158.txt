Genome sequencing and analyses These procedures were according to state of the art techniques and are described in “Results and discussion” section. Bioinformatics analyses Programs used for sequence alignments were BLASTP, Clustal Omega,31 Genedoc,32 BProm (Softberry),33 Pepper34 and ISfinder.35 Phylogenetic tree construction was done by using the phylogeny.fr website.36 Analysis of NRPS sequences was done using online tools such as NRPSpredictor2.37 Accession numbers Accessions for the draft genome projects of S. antibioticus IMRU 3720 and S. anulatus var. chrysomallus ATCC11523 are given in “Results and discussion” section. Description of experimental procedures Preparation of large genomic DNA fragments Streptomyces chrysomallus and Streptomyces antibioticus were grown in liquid CM as described previously.1–3 The cultures contained in addition 0.5% glycine. After 36 hours of growth, mycelium was harvested by suction on a Buechner funnel and washed with distilled water. A total of 1.6 g wet weight myceli of each strain were protoplasted in medium P.4 The protoplasts were washed with the same medium and finally concentrated into ~0.5 mL medium P. The suspension was then portionwise (50 µL) added to 10 mL 0.2 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 8, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After each addition of protoplasts, the solution was gently inverted several times to ensure complete lysis of protoplasts. RNase (50 µg f.c.) was added and the solution was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. DNA was extracted and reextracted by gentle shaking with phenol and chloroform as described in reference.4 After addition of 0.3 M NaOAc, the DNA was spooled onto a glass rod from the interphase overlayered with absolute ethanol and after drying redissolved in tris EDTA (TE) buffer. Repeated precipitation of the DNA sample with ethanol and/or polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 yielded 3.8 mg S. chrysomallus DNA and 2.8 mg of S. antibioticus DNA (260/280=1.67 and 1.58, respectively). Agarose gel electrophoresis (0.6% in Tris/Borate/EDTA [TBE]) revealed bands of both chromosomal DNAs corresponding to approximate sizes of ~50 kb (standards used: λ DNA, λ DNA PstI digest). Quantitation of the DNA was photometrically at 260 nm. The concentration of the DNA was adjusted to 50 ng µL−1 for genome sequencing. Gap filling by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Due to non-overlapping ends of respective contigs the sequences of peptide synthetases genes acmB and acmC in both S. antibioticus and S. chrysomallus each had a gap in their central portions. In case of S. chrysomallus, the total sequences of these genes were already known by previous cosmid sequencing.5 In case of the S. antibioticus genes, the gap was closed by PCR using S. antibioticus chromosomal DNA as template. The primers used were for acmB acmB_f: CGCACGAACTCACGTAGATGTTCC and acmB_r: CTGCACGACACCATCACCACTCAG. For acmC, the primers were acmC_f: TCCC GAGTACAGGGAGTCGTAGAG and acmC_r: CAGCTCCCTCCTCAACCTCATCAC. >acmB gap sequence CTGCACGACACCATCACCACTCAGCGCGTCACGGCGCTCTGGCTCACCAGCTCCCTCCTCAACCTCGTCACCGACCACACCCCCGAAACACTCGCCCACGTACACCAGGTCTGGACCGGCGGCGAAGCCGTCTCCGGCGCGACCGTCCAACAACTCCAGCGCGTTTGCCCGGCGTTGACCGTCATCGACGGGTACGGCCCCACCGAGACCACCACCTTCGCCACCCACCACCCCGTCCCCCGCCCTTACACCGGCAACCCCACCGTCCCCATCGGCCGCCCCATGGCCAACACCCGCACCTACGTACTCGACCCCCACCTCCAACCTGTCCCGCCCGGCGCCACGGGCGAACTGCACATCGGCGGCGCCGGTCTCGCCCGCGGTTATCTGAACCGGCCGGGACTGACCGCGGAACGCTTCATCGCCGACCCCTACGCCAGCGAACCCGGCGCCCGCATGTACCGCACCGGCGACCTGGTGCGCTGGAACGCCGACGGCGATCTCGAGTACCTGGGCCGCAGCGACCACCAGCTCAAGATCCGCGGCTTCCGCATCGAACCCGGCGAGATCGAGAACACCCTCACCGACCACCCCGACATCACCCAAGCCGCCGTCATCGCACACCACGACGAGCCCGGCAACCCTCGACGCCTCACCGCATACGTCGTCGCCGACACCGCCGTAACGCCGGAACATCTACGTGAGTTCGTGCG >acmC gap sequence CAGCTCCCTCCTCAACCTCATCACCGACCACACCCCCGAAACACTCACCCACGTACACCAGGTCTGGACCGGCGGCGAAGCCGTCTCCGGCGCGACCGTCCAACAACTCCAGCGCGCTTGCCCGGCGTTGACCGTCATCGACGGCTACGGCCCCACCGAGACCACCACCTTCGCCACCCACCACCCCGTCCCCCGCCCCTACACCGGCAACCCCACCGTCCCCATCGGCCGCCCCATGGCCAACACCCGCACCTACGTACTCGACACACAACTCCGCCCCGTACCGCCCGGCGTGACCGGAGAGCTGTACATCGCCGGCGCCCATCTGGCCCGCGGCTACCTCGGCAAGCCCCATCTCACCGCCGAACGCTTCGTCGCCGACCCCTACGCCACCGAACCCGGCGCCCGCATGTACCGCACAGGCGACCTCGCACGCCACAACCCCGACGGCGACCTCGAATACCTCGGCCGCACCGACCACCAGCTCAAGATCCGTGGCTTCCGCATCGAACCCGGCGAGATCGAGAACACCCTCACCGACCACCCCGACATCGCCCAGGCCGCCGTCGACCAGCCCGGCGACACCCGCCTCACCGCCTACATCGTGCCCGACACCACCGACACGGCGAAGGACGACGAGGAGCGAAGCCAGATCGGCGAGTGGCAGGATCTCTACGACTCCCTGTACTCGGGA Alignments and nearest neighbor tree of different flavine monooxygenase protein sequences from Streptomyces antibioticus (AFM16) and Streptomyces chrysomallus (JI76) with similarity to kynurenine-3-monooxygenase.
