Negative numbers indicate residues in the leader peptide counting backward from the leader peptide cleavage site. Cloning and heterologous expression of bsf cluster The bsf cluster was directly cloned from the genomic DNA of B. sediminis FA350 via Red/ET recombineering in Escherichia coli. The direct cloning experiments were performed according to the previous protocols (Fu et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016, 2018). Briefly, genomic DNA was digested by appropriate restriction enzyme (BglII) and purified by ethanol precipitation. The digested genomic DNA, p15A vector with homologous arms, T4 polymerase, and buffer were mixed and reacted in a thermocycler with the following program: 25°C, 60 min; 75°C, 20 min; 50°C, 60 min. The mixture was then electroporated into the l-arabinose induced E. coli GB05-dir competent cells and plated on appropriate Luria-Bertani (LB)-agar plates to incubate at 37°C overnight. The bsf region (approximate 22.67 kb) was cloned into the corresponding p15A-cm vectors in E. coli, and several constitutive promotors such as PTn5-Km, Papra, or the inducible promoter Ptet were subsequently inserted upstream to bsfC, respectively, leading to the constructions of p15A-cm-Tn5-km-bsf, p15A-cm-Papra-bsf, and p15A-cm-Ptet-km-bsf. Then, the plasmids were electroporated into the heterologous hosts E. coli BL21(DE3) or E. coli GB2005. In order to heterologous express the BGC in Burkholderiales hosts, the chloramphenicol resistance gene was then replaced with phiC31-site-specific integrase by recombineering, resulting the construction of p15A-phiC31-amp-Papra-bsf. This plasmid was then electroporated into Schlegelella brevitalea DSM 7029 or introduced into the specific chromosomal site of Burkholderia gladioli ATCC10248 and Burkholderia thailandensis E264 with the help of donor strain E. coli WM3064, which is auxotrophic for diaminopimelic acid (Bonis and Gralnick, 2015). The obtained colonies were verified by sequencing. The correct transformants containing bsf cluster were cultured overnight and inoculated into 50 mL antibiotic supplemented LB, M9, or CYMG medium in a 250 mL flask and incubated at 30°C, 200 rpm for 4 days. The resin Amberlite XAD-16 was added into the culture and further incubated for another day. The cells and resins were collected by centrifugation and extracted with 40 mL MeOH for 2 h. The supernatant was concentrated in vacuo and the resulting residue was dissolved in 1 mL MeOH for further metabolic analysis by HPLC-MS or HPLC-HRMS.

After purification by agarose gel electrophoresis and restrictive digestion, the bsfK fragment was inserted into the NdeI-XhoI site of the plasmid pRSFDuet-1 + bsfA to yield the recombinant plasmid pRSFDuet-1 + bsfA + bsfK. Construction of the plasmid pACYCDuet-1 + bsfB1 and pCold-TF + bsfB2 The DNA fragment containing bsfB1 or bsfB2 was amplified by PCR, respectively. The fragments were inserted into the NcoI-HindIII site of pACYCDuet-1 and the NdeI-XhoI site of pCold-TF to yield the recombinant plasmids pACYCDuet-1 + bsfB1 and pCold-TF + bsfB2, respectively. Expression and purification of BsfA The plasmid pRSFDuet-1 + bsfA was transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression. BsfA, fused to an N-terminal 6 × His tag was expressed at 20°C for 24 h with 100 μM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, added at OD600 = 0.6) induction and shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C and re-suspended in buffer A containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM imidazole. After disruption by a low-temperature, ultra-high-pressure homogenizer, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 g and 4°C for 1 h. The soluble fraction was subjected to purification using a Ni Bestarose FF column (Bestchrom, China). Briefly, the column was equilibrated with at least 2 column volumes of binding buffer. Then, the pre-treated sample was loaded onto the Ni Bestarose FF column, and washed with elution buffer containing a low concentration of imidazole (25 mM) to remove the impurities. The sample was further eluted with elution buffer containing a high concentration of imidazole (1 M) to obtain the purified BsfA peptide. The eluted fractions were desalted by reversed phase (RP) HPLC on a Shimadzu LC-20AT system (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) equipped with a ReproSil 300 C4 column (10 × 250 mm, 10 μm, 300 Å, Dr. Maisch, Germany). The solvent used for RP-HPLC separation was deionized water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; solvent A), and acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA (solvent B). A gradient was applied: 5% B for 15 min, ramp up to 100% B over 50 min, hold at 100% B for 7 min, and ramp to 5% B over 5 min. Eluted fractions were monitored by UV absorbance at 220 nm. Desalted precursor peptides were lyophilized and stored at −20°C. The peptide was validated by HPLC-ESI-(HR)MS analysis on an Acclaim TM RSLC 120 C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.2 μm, 120 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) by gradient elution of solvent A (H2O containing 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (CH3CN containing 0.1% formic acid) with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min over a 25 min period as follows: T = 0 min, 5% B; T = 3 min, 5% B; T = 18 min, 95% B; T = 22 min, 95% B; T = 23 min, 5% B; and T = 25 min, 5% B (mAU at 220 nm). Expression and purification of phosphorylated BsfA The plasmid pRSFDuet-1 + bsfA + bsfK was electroporated solely or co-electroporated with pACYCDuet-1 + bsfB1 (without N-terminal 6 × His-tag) into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression. The precursor peptides were purified, desalted, lyophilized, and validated according to the procedures described above for unmodified BsfA precursor peptide. Expression and purification of BsfK The plasmid pET28a + bsfK was transferred into E. coli BL21(DE3) and expressed according to the procedures described above for BsfA. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C and re-suspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole and 10% (v/v) glycerol. After disruption by a low-temperature, ultra-high-pressure homogenizer, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 g and 4°C for 1 h. The soluble fraction was subjected to purification using a Ni Bestarose FF column. The column was equilibrated with at least 2 column volumes of binding buffer. Then, the pre-treated sample was loaded onto the Ni Bestarose FF column, and washed with binding buffer. The sample was further eluted with elution buffer using a stepwise gradient containing different concentrations of imidazole (10–500 mM). The elution fractions were determined by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis, and the fractions containing the recombinant protein were desalted using a PD-10 Desalting Column (GE Healthcare, United States) into storage buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM DTT. The resulting protein was concentrated and stored at −80°C. The purity of the protein was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Expression and purification of BsfB1 and TF-BsfB2 The plasmids pET28a + bsfB1 and pCold-TF + bsfB2 were transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression, respectively. The expression temperature was 15°C for TF-BsfB2 instead of 20°C for BsfK and BsfB1. The proteins were purified to homogeneity, and concentrated according to the procedures described above for BsfK. Site-directed mutagenesis of bsfA Plasmids containing site-directed mutations were generated by PCR amplification with pRSFDuet-1 + bsfA or pRSFDuet-1 + bsfA + bsfK as the template. Then, 1 μL of DpnI enzyme was added to the PCR system and incubated at 37°C for 3 h to remove the template. And the PCR system was electroporated into E. coli BL21 (DE3). After sequencing to validate the fidelity, the resulting precursor peptide variants were expressed individually, or co-expressed with BsfK and BsfB1 in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and purified to homogeneity, desalted, and lyophilized according to the procedures described above for the native precursor peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis of bsfK Plasmids containing site-directed mutations were generated by PCR amplification with pET28a + bsfK as the template. Then, 1 μL of DpnI enzyme was added to the PCR system and incubated at 37°C for 3 h to remove the template. The PCR system was electroporated into E. coli BL21 (DE3). After sequencing to validate the fidelity, the resulting BsfK variants were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), purified to homogeneity and desalted according to the procedures described above for the native protein. Trypsin digestion assay The (phosphorylated) precursor peptide BsfA (or the BsfA variants) was dissolved in 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 7.8) to a concentration of 500 μM. 20 μg trypsin (Promega Biotech Co. Ltd., United States) was dissolved in 20 μL resuspension buffer (50 mM acetic acid) and heated at 30°C for 15 min before utilization for maximum activity. 10 μL resuspended trypsin was added to a total volume of 50 μL BsfA reaction system, followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 h. The reaction was quenched by adding an equal volume of CH3OH. After removal of precipitate by centrifugation, the mixtures were then subjected to HPLC-ESI-HRMS analysis according to the procedure described above for BsfA precursor peptide. In vitro enzymatic assay The assays for BsfK (total volume, 100 μL) were performed at 30°C for 5 h in 100 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP, 200 μM BsfA (or the BsfA variants, BsfA core peptide) in the presence of 20 μM BsfB1 and 20 μM BsfK (or the BsfK variants). ATP was added last to initiate the reaction. The assays were quenched by adding an equal volume of CH3CN. After removal of precipitate by centrifugation, the mixtures were then subjected to HPLC-ESI-(HR)MS analysis according to the procedure described above for BsfA precursor peptide. The assays for TF-BsfB2 (total volume, 100 μL) were performed at 30°C for 12 h in 100 mM K2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 100 μM BsfA in the presence of 20 μM BsfB1 and 20 μM TF-BsfB2.
