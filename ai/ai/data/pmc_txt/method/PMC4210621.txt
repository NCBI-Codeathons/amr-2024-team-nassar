Methods Sequencing of Kutzneria albidagenome The type strain of Kutzneria albida (DSM 43870T) was obtained as a lyophilized culture from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). Genomic DNA was isolated from 30 ml cultures grown in tryptone soy broth (TSB) [88] at 28°C for 24 hours. Total DNA isolation was performed according to the salting out procedure followed by RNase treatment [88]. The obtained DNA was used to construct both a 12 k PE and a WGS library for pyrosequencing on a Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche Applied Science), using the Titanium chemistry to reduce problems with high G + C regions [89]. Assembly of the shotgun reads was performed with the GS Assembler software (version 2.3). A total of 491,980 reads (170,469,390 bp) were assembled into 197 contigs in 1 scaffold. Completion of the draft sequence For finishing of the genome sequence, the CONSED software package was used [90]. Of the 197 gaps, 57 could be closed in silico as these gaps were caused by repetitive elements. For gap closure and assembly validation, the remaining genomic contigs were bridged by 140 PCR products. Gaps between contigs of the whole genome shotgun assembly were closed by sequencing PCR products carried out by IIT GmbH (Bielefeld, Germany) on ABI 377 sequencing machines. To obtain a high quality genome sequence and to correct for homopolymer errors common in pyrosequencing, additional Illumina GAIIx data was used. A total of 5,064,677 reads of 50 bp length was mapped on the genome, resulting in a 25.6x coverage. A total of 19 SNPs, 50 single nucleotide insertions and 49 single nucleotide deletions were found and corrected. Genome analysis and annotation In the first step, gene finding was done using GISMO [91] followed by GenDB 2.0 automatic annotation [92]. In the second annotation step, all predicted ORFs were manually re-inspected to correct start codon and function assignments. Intergenic regions were checked for ORFs missed by the automatic annotation using BLAST [93]. Phylogenetic analysis 19 rDNA sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.017 (gap open penalty 1.53, offset value 0.123, scoring matrix 200PAM/k = 2, algorithm: auto). Dendrogram was built using Geneious [94] (Tamura-Nei genetic distance model, neighbor-joining method, E. coli as an outgroup, bootstrap value 1000, consensus tree with 50% support threshold). Ribosomal RNA sequences for all strains but S. albus were obtained from the Silva rRNA database [32]. Orthology analysis 10 genomes were used for the analysis of the numbers of orthologous genes between genome pairs (GenBank accession version is indicated in parenthesis): Actinosynnema mirum DSM 43827T (CP001630.1), Amycolatopsis mediterranei S699 (CP003729.1), Kitasatospora setae NBRC 14216T (AP010968.1), Kutzneria albida DSM 43870T (deposited to GenBank with accession CP007155), Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL 2338 (AM420293.1), Saccharotrix espanaensis DSM 44229T (HE804045.1), Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680 (BA000030.3), Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (AL645882.2), Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus NBRC 13350 (AP009493.1), Streptosporangium roseum DSM 43021T (CP001814.1). In the first step, 45 pairwise genome-wide reciprocal best-hit protein BLAST searches were performed on 10 genomes, using InParanoid [95] (configured as follows: two-pass BLAST, with bootstrapping, not using an outgroup, matrix BLOSUM45, minimal BLAST bit score 40, sequence overlap cut-off 0.5, segment coverage overlap 0.25). Pseudo genes were excluded from this step. In the next step, MultiParanoid [96] was applied (with default parameters – genes clustered twice were not removed) to generate single file of orthologous gene clusters. The file contains a total of 8,745 orthologous gene clusters with 65,033 genes. Finally, this file was parsed, returning – for each analyzed pair of genomes – the number of orthologous gene clusters which contained genes from both of these genomes. This number was then reported. To find the number of genes common to all 10 genomes, we identified the number of orthologous gene clusters containing 10 unique genome identifiers. Analysis of secondary metabolite clusters For the identification of secondary metabolite clusters, the genome of K. albida was scanned for homologues to known secondary metabolite synthases via BLAST search. These manual investigations were supported by antiSMASH [29]. A set of genes was considered to be a cluster, when there was at least one gene encoding a secondary metabolite synthase. Consequently, a locus possessing a gene with only a single domain, for example an A domain, was not considered to be a cluster. The boundaries of the clusters were defined by the last gene upstream and downstream of a secondary metabolite synthase with homology to a gene encoding a regulator, transporter or tailoring enzyme. In cases where this gene was part of a putative operon, the whole operon was included into the cluster. The modular organization of the type I polyketide and nonribosomal peptide megasynthases were determined using web tools [97, 98]. Secondary metabolites production and LC-MS analysis K. albida was grown in 20 ml of TSB media for 4 days. 2 ml of pre-culture was inoculated into 50 ml of production media. Six different medias were used: TSB, NL5 (NaCl 1 g/l, KH2PO4 1 g/l, MgSO4x7H2O 0.5 g/l, Trace elements solution 2 ml/l, Glycerol 25 g/l, L-glutamine 5.84 g/l), NL19 (Soy flour 20 g/l, Mannitol 20 g/l), NL111 (Meat extract 20 g/l, Maltose extract 10 g/l, CaCO3 10 g/l), CAS [84] and SG [99]. Strain was grown for 7 days at 30°C and 250 rpm. Metabolites were extracted with ethyl acetate from supernatant and acetone-methanol (1:1) mixture from biomass. Extracts were evaporated, dissolved in 100 μl of methanol and samples from biomass and supernatant were combined. 1 μl of each sample were separated on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex) using C18 column (Affymetrix) and linear gradient of acetonitrile against 0.1% ammonium formate solution in water. Samples were analyzed on ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometer system maXis (Bruker Daltonics). Cloning and expression of KALB_7471 KALB_7471 was amplified from the genome of K. albida using KOD polymerase (Novagen) and primers Kal7474LETNcF (TACCATGGTGTTGACCAC GAGCCCATT) and Kal7474ETBR (CGGATCCCGCACGGCCAGCGATTCGG) and cloned as NcoI/BamHI into pET28b. Obtained plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). Strain was grown in 50 ml of LB media till OD600 0.4 and expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. Accumulation of KALB_7471 protein was tested after 8 hours of growth at 30°C by SDS PAGE. Metabolites were extracted with ethyl acetate, evaporated, dissolved in 200 μl of methanol and analyzed as described above. E. coli BL21(DE3) containing empty pET28b was used as control.
