Methods Bacterial strains used in the study The 
E. coli
 strains were collected in Japan from 418 healthy bovines in 2013 and 2014, 278 healthy humans in 2008, 2009 and 2015, and 89 humans with extra-intestinal infections, either bacteraemia (n=67) in 2002–2008 or urinary tract infection (n=22) in 2006 and 2011. They were described recently [25] and corresponded each to a single isolate; duplicates showing less than five SNPs difference in their whole genomes were excluded from this study. A list of the 109 pks-positive isolates is provided in Table S1 (available in the online version of this article). An additional set of 37 
E. coli
 reference strains (Table S2) and seven non-
E. coli
 strains (Table S3) were included in this study; their genome sequences were downloaded from NCBI, except for 
E. coli
 SP15 which was not available and was obtained here (see below). Whole genome sequencing The whole genome sequences of the 785 
E. coli
 isolates were determined by Illumina sequencing [25]. Among these, the genomes of five 
E. coli
 strains (ECSC054, JML285, KS-NP019, NS-NP030 and SI-NP020) were further subjected here to long-read sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION device. The DNA libraries were prepared using the rapid barcoding kit (ONT) and sequenced using MinION R9.4.1 flow cells. Long-read sequencing of 
E. coli
 strain UPEC129 was also performed using a Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RSII sequencer (Genoscreen). The DNA was extracted using Gentra Puregen Yeast/Bact (Qiagen) and the DNA libraries were prepared using the SMRTbell Template Prep kit (PacBio). Hybrid assembly of Illumina paired-end reads and MinION or PacBio reads was performed using Unicycler (v.0.4.8) [26]. The whole genome sequence of 
E. coli
 reference strain SP15 was obtained using Illumina and ONT MinION instruments and assembled as described above. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis The core gene-based phylogenetic tree was reconstructed as described previously [25]. Briefly, core genes were determined using Roary [27] and SNP sites were extracted from the core gene alignment using SNP-sites [28]. The maximum-likelihood (ML) tree was reconstructed using RAxML [29] with the GTR-GAMMA model and displayed using iTOL [30]. For the phylogenetic analysis of the entire pks island, the genome sequences of pks-positive strains were aligned with the entire pks island sequence of strain IHE3034 using MUMmer [31] and the SNP sites located therein were identified. After removing SNP sites on the VNTR region, a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree was reconstructed by mega7 [32] using the Tamura–Nei evolutionary model. Co-phylogenetic analysis of the core-gene-based ML tree and the pks-based NJ tree was performed using the ‘cophylo’ function of the R package Phytools [33]. Sequence type and phylogroup determination was performed as described previously [25]. The pks sequences from four 
E. coli
 strains belonging to distinct phylogroups (i.e. SI-NP020, KS-NP019, UPEC129 and ECSC054 from phylogroups A, B1, B2 and D, respectively) were extracted from hybrid assemblies and compared at the nucleotide level with that of the reference 
E. coli
 strain IHE3034. In addition, the amino acid sequences were obtained for the 19 clb genes of each strain and aligned by muscle with mega7 [32]. The alignment file was analysed with the sequence identity and similarity online software (http://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/sias.html; accessed in July 2020). The comparison of pks sequences from 
E. coli
 and other bacterial species was performed with blastn (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch). Each pks region was defined from clbA to clbS and used as the query nucleotide sequence against each pks region as the subject. Then, the alignment was visualized with the Artemis Comparison Tool (v13.0.0) [34]. The integrase nucleotide and amino acid sequences were aligned using muscle (v3.8.31) and the phylogeny was analysed with PhyML (v3.1/3.0 aLRT) prior to tree visualization with TreeDyn (v198.3) (http://www.phylogeny.fr; accessed in September 2020). The CC95 strains were typed for their fimH allele using FimTyper (v1.0) (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/FimTyper/; accessed in November 2020) and were further assigned to subgroups A–E by analysis of the presence of either of the five subgroup-specific genes described previously [35]. PCR analysis of the clbJK fusion gene The 5651 bp deletion in the clbJ-clbK region resulting in the clbJK fusion gene was tested using a duplex PCR assay, with two primer pairs. The first primer pair (clbK-F, 5′-GACTGCCCAACATACGCTCCG-3′; clbK-R, 5′-TTGTGTCGTTGTACTCTCGGC-3′) was used to amplify a 722 bp long DNA fragment that is located within the deleted region and is thus only present in strains with an intact clbJ-clbK region. The second primer pair consisted of primers clbJK-F (5′-AGAATTACCCACTGCCACCA-3′) and clbJK-R (5′-GGCGCTAATGGATCAGATGT-3′) flanking the deleted region, and was used to amplify a 1441 bp long DNA fragment only present in strains with a clbJK fusion gene. The strains with an intact clbJ-clbK region or a clbJK fusion gene yielded a 722 or a 1441 bp long amplification product, respectively. The final reaction mixture volume of 50 µl contained 2 µl template DNA, 1× GoTaq Reaction buffer, 200 µM of each dNTP, 4 mM of MgCl2, 1.25 U of GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 0.2 µM of each primer (Eurofins Genomics). Amplification was done in a GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems), with the following programme: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 45 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s; and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Electrophoresis was carried out in 1 % agarose gel and the PCR products were visualized after Gel Red (Biotium) staining using a Bio-Rad Chemidoc XRS system (Bio-Rad). In vitro DNA interstrand crosslinking assay ICL activity was assessed as described previously [15]. Briefly, 3×106

E. coli
 cells or 6×106

Erwinia oleae
 cells pre-grown for 3.5 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen) were mixed with EDTA (1 mM) and 400 ng of linearized plasmid pUC19 DNA and the mixtures were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. After pelleting the bacteria, the DNA was purified from the supernatant and analysed by electrophoresis on denaturing (40 mM NaOH – 1 mM EDTA) 1 % agarose gels. ICL activity of 
Erwinia oleae
 was also tested in the presence of 400 nM 6-histidine-ClbS, which was purified with HisPur nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Thermo Scientific) from a culture of BL21(DE3) strain hosting the plasmid pET28a-ClbS-His, as described previously [15]. Megalocytosis assay Non-haemolytic pks-positive strains were tested for megalocytosis on infected HeLa cells as described previously [5, 36]. Briefly, HeLa cells grown to 50 % confluence in cell culture 96-well plates were inoculated with 5 µl of an overnight culture of bacteria in infection medium (DMEM with 25 mM HEPES) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then washed and incubated for 48–72 h in cell culture medium supplemented with gentamicin at 200 µg ml−1, and then stained with methylene blue for microscopy examination. H2AX phosphorylation assay HeLa cells were infected as described above and H2AX phosphorylation was quantified immediately after the 4 h infection step by immunofluorescence as described elsewhere [37]. C14-asn quantification E. coli
 strains were grown for 24 h at 37 °C in 10 ml DMEM-HEPES (Gibco), resuspended in 500 µl Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen) and then crushed with a Precellys instrument (Ozyme). After addition of an internal standard mixture (deuterium-labelled compounds; 400 ng ml−1), cold methanol (MeOH) was added and samples were solid-phase extracted on HLB plates (OASIS HLB 2 mg, 96-well plate; Waters). Lipids were eluted with MeOH, evaporated under N2, resuspended in MeOH and analysed by HPLC/MS-MS analysis (LC-MS/MS) (MetaToulLipidomics Facility), as described previously [21].
