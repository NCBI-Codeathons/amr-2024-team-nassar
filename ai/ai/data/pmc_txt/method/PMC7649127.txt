Materials and Methods Bacterial Strain Identification BSXE-1601 was obtained from the Microbial Culture Collection Center, Laboratory of Aquaculture Ecology, Ocean University of China (also preserved in China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center, CGMCC NO. 15949). The morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of the strain BSXE-1601 were tested according to Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (Krieg and Holt, 1984). The genetic identification was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing as described earlier with some modifications (Gomez-Gil et al., 2012). Briefly, the DNA of the strain BSXE-1601 was extracted by simple boiling (Ribeiro et al., 2016). Then polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was undertaken using universal primers (27F, AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG; 1491R, TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT) with the following amplification program: one cycle at 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min 30 s, 72°C for 2 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. After visualizing the PCR products using 1% gel electrophoresis at a constant voltage of 110 V, fragments were sequenced by Sangon (Shanghai, China). Nucleotide sequence was subjected to homology search using the BLAST software of the NCBI. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method using MEGA 6.0 software according to Hall (2013). Safety Assessment of the Strain BSXE-1601 To identify the toxicity of the strain BSXE-1601 to shrimp, its safety in shrimp was identified in the laboratory via immersion, dietary, and injection administrations. The strain BSXE-1601 was applied at a concentration of 104, 106, and 108 CFU ml–1 in the immersion assay, 104, 106, and 108 CFU g–1 in the dietary assay, and 104, 106, and 108 CFU shrimp–1 in the injection test. The detailed procedure is specified in “SI toxicity assay” in Supplementary Material. Aquatic Pathogenic Strains The selected indicator bacteria were 10 common aquatic pathogenic strains (Table 1). V. harveyi SRTT9, V. alginolyticus AR-1, and V. vulnificus S01P2 were isolated from diseased L. vannamei. V. splendidus BSD11 and Pseudoalteromonas sp. LPE40 were isolated from diseased sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. These five strains were stored in the Microbial Culture Collection Center, Laboratory of Aquaculture Ecology, KLMME, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China. V. parahaemolyticus 20130629002S01 isolated from the AHPND-infected L. vannamei were kindly provided by the Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Qingdao, PR China. Moreover, V. parahaemolyticus 20130629002S01 was identified as an AHPND-causing strain (VPAHPND 2S01 for short) (Dong et al., 2017a,b; Chen et al., 2018). Edwardsiella tarda HC01090721 and Streptococcus iniae NUF849 were kindly provided by the Laboratory of Pathology and Immunology of Aquatic Animals, KLMME, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, PR China and proved to be pathogenic strains for Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus (Tang et al., 2010; Sheng et al., 2018).

Microbial Fermentation A single colony of the strain BSXE-1601 grown on nutrient agar (NA) at 28°C overnight was inoculated into a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of nutrient broth medium. After incubating at 28°C overnight in an aerobic atmosphere on a rotary shaker with 180 rpm, 1 ml of cultural liquid was transferred as a seed into 100 ml of nutrient broth (NB) medium. The flasks were incubated at 28°C with 180 rpm overnight. Similarly, all of the aquatic pathogenic strains used for bacteriostatic experiments were grown in LB35 medium at 28°C overnight under aerobic conditions. Assessment of Antagonistic Activity in vitro Based on Agar Diffusion Assay The antagonistic activities of culture broth and step purification fractions were evaluated by an agar well diffusion method (Lertcanawanichakul and Sawangnop, 2008). The inoculum was prepared using the 10 selected pathogenic strains grown overnight in LB broth medium and adjusted to a concentration of 106 CFU ml–1. Aliquots of 100 μl of the culture broths were inoculated onto LB nutrient agar medium. The wells (diameter, 6 mm) were then punched in each plate and a 100 μl aliquot of strain BSXE-1601 culture broth or step purification fractions was filled into each well. The plates were aerobically incubated at 28°C for 24–48 h. The inhibition zones were then measured. Well diffusion tests were performed in triplicate for each strain. Assessment of Antagonistic Activity in vivo Based on a Feeding Assay Experimental Diets To check the resistant activity of the strain BSXE-1601 against vibrios in vivo in shrimps, a feeding test was conducted in the lab. Basal diet (control diet) was formulated with commercial shrimp food (No. 2 feed for L. vannamei, from Nantong Chia Tai Co., Ltd, Nantong, China), covered with a layer of sodium alginate and fish oil (3.15 g 500 g–1 and 4.2 ml 500 g–1, respectively) (Sun et al., 2012). Strain BSXE-1601 was cultured overnight in NB medium as described above, and then harvested by centrifugation (2800 × g for 10 min). The fresh cells were resuspended in sterile normal saline, and then sprayed to the surface of commercial shrimp food, and the mixture was covered with a layer of sodium alginate and fish oil (the same ratio with control diet). On basis of basal diet, two treatment diets were supplemented with 3.5 × 107 and 3.5 × 108 CFU g–1 of strain BSXE-1601 (named as BSXE07 and BSXE08). All the diets were kept at 4°C for using later. Experimental Animals and Feeding Experiment L. vannamei, obtained from hatchery of Baorong Aquatic Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (Qingdao, China), were fed with basal diet and acclimated simultaneously for 10 days by increasing salinity 2‰ per two days from 21 to 30‰. Then 108 similar-sized individuals (4.00 ± 0.07 g) which had been starved for 24 h were randomly distributed into 9 aquariums (53 cm × 28 cm × 34 cm, 50 l), with a density of 12 shrimps per aquarium. The shrimps were fed daily at 8 am and 5 pm for 7 days, with the feeding amount of 4–5% of shrimp weight. Each experimental group (BSXE07 and BSXE08) was repeated at three times. Uneaten feed and feces in the tank were collected by pipetting before the next feeding. During the feeding trial, the environmental conditions were suitable for shrimps (temperature, 23 ± 1°C; salinity, 30‰; pH, 8.0 ± 0.1; dissolved oxygen, >5 mg l–1). The food consumption and mortality were recorded daily. Sample Collection At day 4 and day 7, three shrimps were selected from each aquarium. Hepatopancreas from surface-disinfected shrimp were aseptically removed and homogenized. A series of 10-fold dilutions was prepared using sterile normal saline, and 0.1 ml from each dilution was plated on TCBS agar using spread plating. Vibrio species were enumerated after a 48-h-incubation at 28°C. Characterization of Molecules Responsible for the Antagonistic Activity Preliminary Isolation (i) Preparation of cell-free supernatant (CFS). The overnight culturing broth of the strain BSXE-1601 was centrifuged at 448 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was treated with filtration using a 0.22 μm Millipore filter to obtain CFS, and the bacteria were resuspended in normal saline. The inhibitory activities of both the CFS and cell resuspension solution were determined by the agar well diffusion method as described before, using the strain VPAHPND 2S01 as the indicator bacterium. (ii) Preliminary purification of CFS by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The strain BSXE-1601 CFS was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation to obtain protein precipitation and deproteinized supernatant. Protein precipitate was solubilized in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.2) and then dialyzed to remove salt to obtain dialysate. The inhibitory activities of both the dialysate and deproteinized supernatant were determined by the agar well diffusion method, using the strain VPAHPND 2S01 as the indicator bacterium, contrasted with untreated CFS. Physicochemical and Enzymatic Treatments For thermostability assay, the CFS sample from the strain BSXE-1601 was subjected to heat treatment for 15, 30, 45, and 60 min at 60, 80, and 100°C, respectively. For pH stability, the strain BSXE-1601 CFS was incubated for 6 h at 28°C at different pH values, adjusted with NaOH and HCl. Sensitivity to proteinase K was tested by incubation for 30, 60, and 120 min at 37°C. The proteinase K was used at a final concentration of 1 mg ml–1. The antagonistic activity was determined before and after each treatment by the agar well diffusion method, using the strain VPAHPND 2S01 as the indicator bacterium. Isolation and Characterization The cell-free supernatant from the strain BSXE-1601 (5 l) was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 5 l) to give a yellow oily residue (6.3 g) by evaporation of menstruum in vacuum, which was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column eluting with CH2Cl2/MeOH mixtures of a stably growing polarity (100:0, 50:1, 30:1, 20:1, 10:1, 1:1, v/v) to afford six parts (F1, 820 mg; F2, 3.60 g; F3, 187 mg; F4, 225 mg; F5, 126 mg and F6, 367 mg). Bioassay results indicated that F5 and F6 (10:1 and 1:1 CH2Cl2/MeOH) had a potent antagonistic effect against the selected pathogens. The mixture of Fraction 5 (126 mg) and Fraction 6 (367 mg) was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 chromatography (20 mm × 800 mm) and further purified by HPLC over ODS (40% MeCN-H2O, 0.05% TFA, v/v) to give compounds 1 (tR 8.37 min; 5 mg), 2 (tR 8.84 min) and 3 (tR 9.05 min). Due to the fast interconversion between 2 and 3 in methanol under room temperature, the structures of 2 and 3 were determined from the spectroscopic data of their mixture (3 mg), through careful comparison of their ESI-MS and NMR with previously reported data (Iron et al., 1982; Itoh et al., 1982). Determination of MICs The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the purified antagonistic compounds for the 10 selected aquatic pathogenic strains were determined by the broth microdilution method according to Wiegand with a few modifications (Wiegand et al., 2008). Briefly, broth dilution used LB35 growth medium containing geometrically increasing concentrations (a twofold dilution series) of the antimicrobial substances, which was inoculated with 106 CFU ml–1 of pathogenic cells. The MICs were considered to be the lowest concentration of antagonistic substances that caused total inhibition of bacterial growth. MICs were also determined in triplicate for each strain. Genome Sequencing, Assembly, and Annotation The genomic DNA of the strain BSXE-1601 was extracted using the TIANamp bacteria DNA kit (Tiangen, China), and then sequenced with a 10-kb SMRTbellTM template library using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing. Pre-assembly error correction was performed with the hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP) of SMRT Analysis software using default parameters. Then all of the obtained data were assembled into a single circular chromosome without gaps. The genome circle was prepared using Circos ver. 0.641. Bacterial genes were predicted by Glimmer 3.02 software (Delcher et al., 2007) and gene functions were annotated by BLASTP using NR, KEGG, GO, COG, Swiss-Prot, and CAZy databases. The rRNAs and tRNAs were identified using RNAmmer 1.22 and tRNAscan-SE 1.3.13, respectively. The strain BSXE-1601 genome was analyzed using AntiSMASH (Blin et al., 2019) to predict the gene clusters coding for secondary metabolites. The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) (Jia et al., 2016) was used to identify the genes relating to antimicrobial resistance. Statistics The Vibrio counts in hepatopancreas of shrimp were subjected to two-way repeated measures ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test, with BSXE-1601 adding concentration and time as factors. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 using a significance level of 5%.
