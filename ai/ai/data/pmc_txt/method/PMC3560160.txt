Methods Cell culture and development of BTZ-resistant cell lines The human EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastic cell line JY (ATCC) was cultured in IMDM-medium (PAA, The Cell Culture Company, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine. BTZ-resistant JY cell lines were established by stepwise increasing concentrations of BTZ over a period of 6 months, starting at a BTZ concentration of 1.5 nM (IC10 concentration; establishing 10% cell growth inhibition compared to the untreated control) up to a concentration of 100 nM. Cells stably growing in the presence of 35 nM (JY/35) and 100 nM BTZ (JY/100) were isolated after 3 months and 6 months of stepwise selection, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed with cells cultured in drug-free medium for at least 4 days. Reagents / chemicals / antibodies Bortezomib (BTZ)/Velcade™ was provided by Millennium Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, USA). Carfilzomib and ONX 0914 were generously provided by Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (South San Francisco, USA). MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leucinal) was purchased from Calbiochem/ Merck (Nottingham, UK). Phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Rituximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin G1, was purchased from Roche (Roche Netherlands B.V., Woerden, The Netherlands). Other antibodies were from the following sources: ubiquitin: (P4D1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8017) and β-actin (C4, Santa Cruz, sc-47778) mouse monoclonal antibodies; goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to IRDye® 800CW (Odyssey; L1-COR Biosciences, Nebraska, USA). Isolation of mRNA, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative RT-PCR Following RNA isolation with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), cDNA was synthesized using 0.75U/ul M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a RT buffer (Invitrogen), containing 5 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 2 mM dNTP (Roche), pdN6 96ug/ml (Roche), and 2U/ulRNAsin (HT Biotechnology Ltd., Cambridge, UK). mRNA expression levels of proteasome subunits PSMB5 (β5), PSMB6 (β1), PSMB7 (β2), PSMB8 (ß5i), PSMB9 (ß1i), PSMB10 (ß2i), and the endogenous housekeeping gene β-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reference, were quantified using real-time PCR analysis (Taqman) using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands) as described previously
[41]. Briefly, for PSMB5, a Taqman gene expression assay was used according to the manufacturers’ instructions (Hs00605652_m1, Applied Biosystems). All other primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) and are indicated in Additional file
1: Table S1. Probes were labeled with 5’-FAM and 3’-BHQ1 as a reporter. Real-time PCR was performed in a total reaction volume of 25 μl containing TaqMan buffer A (Applied Biosystems), 4 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM of each dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 1.25 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Samples were heated for 10 min at 95°C to activate the AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase and amplified during 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 60 s at 60°C. Relative mRNA expression levels of the target genes in each sample were calculated using the comparative cycle time (Ct) method. The Ct of the target gene was normalized to the GUS Ct value by subtracting the GUS Ct value from the target Ct value. The mRNA expression level for each target PCR relative to GUS was calculated using the following equation: mRNA expression = 2(Ct target-Ct GUS) × 100%. Proteasome constitutive-immuno subunit ELISA assay (ProCISE) The ProCISE assay for quantification of individual constitutive (β5, β1, β2) and immunoproteasome (β5i, β1i, β2i) subunits was performed as previously described
[33,34]. Expression of each c20S and i20S subunit in JY/WT, JY/35, and JY/100 cells was examined after cells were cultured in the absence of BTZ for one week. Pellets of 10 x 106 -15 x 106 cells were washed three times with PBS, frozen on dry ice, thawed, then incubated in 100 μL of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA) for 15 minutes on ice. Lysed pellets were micro-centrifuged (15 min, 14,000 rpm, 4°C), the supernatant collected, and protein content determined by BCA assay (Pierce), utilizing a BSA standard. Cell lysates were diluted in lysis buffer to 1 mg/mL, and then incubated with a proteasome active site probe (PABP; 5 μM) for 2 hours at 25°C. Samples were denatured with 8 M guanidine hydrochloride (Fisher Scientific) and subunits bound to PABP were captured with streptavidin-conjugated sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) in 96-well 0.65 μm porous filter plates (Millipore). Individual subunits were probed with subunit-specific primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The SuperSignal ELISA Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) was utilized to generate luminescent signal associated with HRP binding. Luminescence after 5 minutes of signal development was monitored on a plate reader (Tecan Safire). Subunit content was expressed as nanograms of subunit per microgram of total protein, as calculated from a standard curve of human purified constitutive or immunoproteasome, assayed simultaneously with the cell lysate samples. Cytokine release assay JY cells were seeded in 96-wells plates at a cell density of 5 x 104/200μl and stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA (Sigma) and 750 ng/ml ionomycin (Sigma). After 24 hours, culture supernatants were collected and analyzed using the cytometric bead array (CBA) human inflammatory cytokines kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative measurements of TNF-α were performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton and Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with the CellQuest program. FACS analysis – immunophenotyping JY cells were immunophenotyped using FITC-, PE- and/or APC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) directed against: CD80 (1:10), CD86 (1:10), CD40 (1:10) HLA-ABC (1:25), HLA-DR (1:25), CD19 (1:10), and CD20 (1:10) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and CD54 (1:10) (Leinco Technologies Inc., St. Louis, USA). In short, 3 x 104 – 8 x 104 cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.02% NaN3, and incubated with specific or corresponding isotype-matched control Mabs for 30 minutes at 4°C. Cells were washed and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton and Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using the Cell Quest program. Results were expressed as percentages of positive cells and the mean fluorescence index was calculated based on mean fluorescence intensities. Western blot analysis Accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins upon treatment with BTZ was determined by Western blot analysis as described previously
[38]. In short, 3 × 106 JY/WT, JY/35 and JY/100 cells were incubated in 10 ml growth medium in the absence or presence of 10nM, 35nM and 100nM BTZ, respectively. After 24 hours of incubation, cells were harvested and washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS at pH 7.4. Total cell lysates were prepared by resuspending in 0.1 ml lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) containing: 20% PIC (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) and 10% NaVO4. The suspension was sonicated (MSE sonicator, amplitude 7, for 3 × 5 seconds with 20-second time intervals at 4°C) and centrifuged in an Eppendorf micro-centrifuge (5 min, 12,000 rpm, 4°C). Protein content of the supernatant was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard. Protein aliquots (30 μg) of total cell lysates were fractionated on a 4-20% TGX pre-cast gel (BioRad) containing SDS, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were pre-incubated for 1 hour in blocking buffer (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc., Gilbertsville, PA, USA) to prevent non-specific antibody binding. After blocking, the membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with an ubiquitin-specific antibody (1:200). After 3 washing steps with Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween, the membranes were incubated for 1 hour with goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to IRDye ® 800CW (1:10000, Odyssey; L1-CORBiosciences, Nebraska, USA). Detection of antibody binding was obtained using the LI-COR Odyssey scanner (Biosciences) according to the manufacturers’ instructions, and digital image acquisition and quantification was performed using the Odyssey infrared imaging system software (version 3.0.16, LI-COR Biosciences, Nebraska, USA). Expression of ubiquitinated proteins was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:200) as described above. β-actin (1:1000 diluted antibody) was used as the control for equal loading. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (R-CDC) assay JY cells (5 x 104cells) were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates in IMDM medium with or without rituximab (concentrations ranging from 0.1 μg-50 μg/ml) and 5% baby rabbit complement serum (Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada). After 1 hour of incubation at 37°C, the numbers of non-viable cells were determined after propidium iodide (PI) staining using flow cytometry. The percentage of lysed (PI+) cells was calculated based on a total of 1.2 x 104 measured events. Cell lysis in control conditions (without baby rabbit serum) was subtracted to obtain specific complement-dependent lysis. Statistical analysis For comparisons between groups, ANOVA and Student’s t-test were used. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05.
