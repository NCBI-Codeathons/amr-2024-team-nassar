MATERIALS AND METHODS FAC Generation, transformation, growth, and extraction. AtFAC7O19 was produced in a prior study through the unbiased random shear of Aspergillus terreus ATCC 20542 genomic DNA (10). Using previously described methods, targeted metabolomics and FAC metabolite scoring identified a target compound with m/z 310.1188 that was likely to be produced from this FAC (10). AtFAC7O19 was then maintained in Escherichia coli strain DH10B and used to transform the Red/ET-inducible E. coli strain SW012 prior to DNA preparation and transformation of A. nidulans, as described in a previous study (11). Following transformation of A. nidulans, growth and extraction of FAC-containing and control strains were completed as previously reported (10). LC-MS analysis. Dried metabolite extracts were resuspended in methanol to a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Samples were sonicated for 10 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 21,000 × g. Samples were analyzed by LC-MS using a Thermo Q Exactive mass spectrometer with an inline Agilent 1290 ultrahigh performance liquid chromatograph (UHPLC) with a Phenomenex Kinetix 1.3-μm-particle-size column with dimensions 2 × 100 mm. Five percent acetonitrile in water with 0.01% formic acid was used as buffer A, and 100% acetonitrile with 0.01% formic acid was used as buffer B. An 8 min, 0 to 100% buffer B, gradient was used. The MS heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source was set at 275°C, with sheath gas set at 60 arbitrary units and spray voltage set at 3.5 kV. Data were collected in data-dependent mode, with the top five ions from each scan selected for higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) MS2 fragmentation analysis with a normalized collision energy of 25.0%. A resolution of 17,500 was used for both MS1 and MS2. Stable isotope labeling studies. Isotopically labeled media were prepared by adding 1 mM (each) [13C6]anthranilate or l-tryptophan-D5 to plates of minimal medium containing glucose. The plates were inoculated with concentrated spore stocks of A. terreus and incubated at 30°C for 5 days. Metabolites were extracted from the plates using Oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance solid phase extraction cartridges, with elution using 100% methanol. Extracts were dried in vacuo and analyzed by LC-MS as described above. Sequence analysis of AtFAC7019. To compare the AtFAC7019 DNA sequence to that of the A. terreus reference strain NIH 2624, a barcoded Illumina next-generation sequencing library of AtFAC7O19 was generated using a True-Seq kit and pooled for sequencing with other samples at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Biotechnology Center DNA Sequencing Facility. A >1,000× coverage of the AtFAC7O19 DNA sequence was achieved. A single contig (114.911 kb, completed and finished FAC clone sequence) was obtained using the DNAStar next-generation sequence assembly program. The entire FAC sequence was confirmed by FAC end sequences, PmeI and NotI digestion, and contour-clamped homogenous-electric field gel electrophoresis. From this sequencing, we identified 35,769 kb of extra sequence toward the telomere in AtFAC7O19 that was not present in the reference genome (NIH 2624). However, the terreazepine gene cluster is well conserved in both strains. The AtFAC7O19 sequence is available through GenBank under accession number MT376588. Genes have been annotated in Table S1A in the supplemental material. Gene cluster editing and production of gene and domain deletants. Gene and domain deletions were made with a modified method as previously described for whole-genome deletions (10, 11). Briefly, we used a GalK-gpdA-p gene cassette for overexpression of the transcription factor (TF) gene (ATEG_07357), a kanamycin gene cassette for deleting both ATEG_07358 (NRPS, tzpA) and ATEG_07359 (IDO, tzpB), and a GalK-apramycin (Ap) gene cassette for domain deletions as previously reported for whole-gene deletions. For example, to delete the T3 or C2T3 domains of tzpA, a pair of primers for the GalK and apramycin resistance gene cassette (24 bases forward and 23 bases reverse shown in Table S1B as lowercase letters) with an additional 50 bp (uppercase letters shown in Table S1B) of either T3 or C2T3 flanking to generate the GalK-Ap PCR amplicons. Gel-purified PCR amplicons were used to transform RedET-inducible E. coli strain SW102. Recombineered FAC colonies were then selected on LB medium with apramycin, and second-step recombineering transformation using either the AtFAC7O19-58ΔT or AtFAC7O19-58-ΔCT oligonucleotide enabled excision of the GalK-Ap gene cassette. All FAC recombinants were confirmed by PCR, restriction digestion, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and sequencing as needed. The primers for deletions are listed in Table S1B. Purification and structural analysis of terreazepine. AtFAC7O19-transformed A. nidulans were grown on 576 plates and extracted as described, yielding 400 mg of dried extract. The crude extract was subjected to normal-stage flash chromatography using a CombiFlash NextGen 300 system (Teledyne-ISCO) and examined using UV absorbance at 254 and 280 nm. The extract was separated using a silica 12-g gold column (Teledyne-ISCO) at a flow rate of 30 ml/min with a 50-min hexane/CHCl3/methanol (MeOH) gradient. Of the 12 resulting simplified fractions, fraction 6 contained the highest concentration of the target metabolite and was subjected to reversed-phase separation using an Agilent 1200 HPLC and analyzed using OpenLAB CDS Chemstation software (version number 1.8.1, Agilent Technologies). Fraction 6 (56.9 mg) was separated on a Kinetix C18 semipreparatory column (5 μm; 100 Å; 250 × 10.0 mm; Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Approximately 200 μl of a 10-mg/ml solution was injected per run, and subsequent fractions were pooled together for analysis. The 45-min run began at 20:80 CH3CN-H2O and was increased to 40:60 over 20 min. The gradient was increased to 100% CH3CN over the next 20 min and held at 100% for the remainder of the run. Terreazepine eluted from 16 to 17.5 min (1.5 mg, 90% purity). All solvents used for chromatographic separation were acquired through Sigma-Aldrich and were HPLC-grade. MS2 spectra for terreazepine are shown in Fig. S2. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra for the target compound, including 1H, 13C, correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC), and heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra, were obtained using a Bruker Avance III 500-MHz system equipped with a DCH CryoProbe at 298.2 K. NMR spectra from the natural compound match those of the synthesized compound (see “Total synthesis and stereochemical analysis of terreazepine” below and Fig. S3). NMR spectra of the synthetic compound in DMSO-d6 are the most complete and were used for full structural characterization (Table S2 and Fig. S3A to S3G). 1H and 13C NMR spectra are also provided for the synthetic compound in methanol-d4 (Fig. S3H and S3I). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 3.02 (dd, J = 18.7, 2.6 Hz, 1H), 3.24 (dd, J = 18.7, 13.3 Hz, 1H), 4.99 (ddd, J = 13.2, 7.4 Hz, 2.4, 1H), 6.38 (br s, 2H), 6.54 (t, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H), 6.69 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 7.17 (m, 1H), 7.19 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.27 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 7.58 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 7.61 (td, J = 7.2, 1.4 Hz, 1H), 7.76 (dd, J = 7.9, 1.7 Hz, 1H), 8.42 (d, J = 7.4 Hz, 1H), 10.38 (s, 1H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 45.75, 46.14, 113.87, 114.59, 116.36, 122.23, 124.36, 128.47 (2C), 130.12, 132.13, 134.25, 137.72, 149.70, 168.63, 171.25, 197.76. 1H NMR (500 MHz, methanol-d4) δ 7.89 (dd, J = 7.9, 1.6 Hz, 1H), 7.62 (td, J = 7.8, 1.7 Hz, 1H), 7.57 (dd, J = 7.9, 1.5 Hz, 1H), 7.32 (td, J = 7.5, 1.1 Hz, 1H), 7.22 (ddd, J = 8.5, 7.1, 1.6 Hz, 1H), 7.18 (dd, J = 8.1, 1.1 Hz, 1H), 6.76 (dd, J = 8.2, 1.1 Hz, 1H), 6.66 (ddd, J = 8.1, 7.2, 1.1 Hz, 1H), 5.18 (dd, J = 12.4, 3.5 Hz, 1H), 3.26 (dd, J = 18.8, 12.3 Hz, 1H), 3.19 (dd, J = 18.8, 3.5 Hz, 1H). 13C NMR (126 MHz, methanol-d4) δ 197.84, 171.93, 169.80, 149.11, 137.29, 134.12, 132.13, 130.11, 129.00, 127.83, 124.76, 122.14, 116.75, 115.87, 115.24, 46.50, 46.24. The 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S3C) enabled detection of two CH2 protons (δ 3.02 and 3.24), one CH proton (δ 4.99), two amide protons (δ 8.42 and 10.38), two NH2 protons (δ 6.38), and eight aromatic protons (δ 6.54–7.76). This is consistent with the proposed molecular formula of C17H15N3O3. The presence of eight proton signals in the aromatic region is consistent with the presence of two di-substituted benzene rings, while the three protons in the aliphatic region are consistent with the CH and CH2 species located in the seven-membered azepane-2,5-dione substructure. The downfield shift at H-11 (δ 4.99) is congruent with its adjacency to an amide nitrogen at position 12. The amide proton shift at δ 10.38 was readily assigned to the proton at position 2 given its adjacency to the aromatic ring system, while the remaining amide proton at H-12 was assigned to the δ 8.42 shift. The 13C spectrum (Fig. S3D) contains only 16 signals, but one signal (δ 128.47) corresponds to two carbons, further supporting the proposed molecular formula. Three of the signals corresponded to carbonyls, including two amides and one ketone (δ 168.63, 171.25, and 197.76, respectively), one was a CH2 (δ 45.75), one was an N-CH (δ 46.14), and 12 were aromatic CH or quaternary signals (8 CHs and 4 quaternaries, δ 113.87–149.70). 2D experiments were used to correlate aromatic 1H and 13C bonds, as well as to determine the connectivity of the molecule. The HSQC experiment enabled linkage of protons to their corresponding carbons (Fig. S3F), while the COSY and HMBC spectra helped to build connections through the molecule. Three distinct portions of the molecule are evident using COSY correlations linking protons H-4 through H-7, protons H-10 through H-12, and protons H-15 through H-18 (Fig. S3E). The remainder of the molecule could be pieced together using HMBC correlations (Fig. S3G). We determined that the site of cyclization was at position 1 due to the correlation between the amide proton at H-2 and the carbonyl carbon C-1.

(i) Creation of gene cluster family networks. We downloaded a data set of 1,037 fungal genomes from GenBank and the Joint Genome Institute Genome Portal, excluding Saccharomycotina as this subphylum contains a large number of genomes with very few gene clusters. Biosynthetic gene clusters were detected using the command-line version of antiSMASH 4 with default parameters (41). For creation of gene cluster families, we used an approach similar to those mentioned (42, 43). Protein domains were detected using the HMMER suite hmmsearch, resulting in protein domain arrays for each gene cluster. For each pair of gene clusters, the median sequence identity of backbone enzyme domains and the Jaccard similarity of protein domain sets was calculated. These two similarity metrics were combined for a single similarity score:similarity score=(0.8×sequence identity)+(0.2×Jaccard similarity) A final clustering step was performed using DBSCAN clustering with an epsilon value of 0.55 (corresponding to a similarity score of 0.45). This process thus resulted in a network of gene clusters, where subgraphs correspond to gene cluster families. All gene cluster family dendrograms (Fig. 3 and Fig. S6) were created using unweighted-pair group method using average linkages (UPGMA) clustering based on this same cluster similarity score. (ii) Sequence alignments. All sequence alignments were performed using MUSCLE with default parameters in MEGA. For the data in Table S3, adenylation domain sequences from IDO-containing gene clusters were aligned together with known adenylation domain sequences from MIBiG. Putative substrate-binding residues were extracted using gramicidin S synthetase as a reference. (iii) Phylogenetic analyses. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using default parameters in MEGAX (44) to produce a tree containing IDOs in 15 Aspergillus species. The tree was constructed using 500 bootstrap iterations. (iv) Determining IDO counts per genome. All Aspergillus genomes included in this study were analyzed using the HMMER suite tool hmmsearch, using the IDO Pfam model (PF01231) as a query model, a minimum subject sequence length of 350 residues, and a maximum E value of 1E−30.
