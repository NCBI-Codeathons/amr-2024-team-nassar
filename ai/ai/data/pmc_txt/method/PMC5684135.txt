Chemical reagents were purchased from standard commercial sources. All the primers, strains, and plasmids used are in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Sequence analyses of GyrI-like proteins The GyrI-like SMBD-containing proteins (totally 12,304 sequences up to September 2016) were obtained using YtkR7 as query from the InterPro website (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence-search)20. PSI-BLAST using the human TEX264 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_001123356.1) as query was performed on the NCBI website (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM = blastp&PAGE_TYPE = BlastSearch&LINK_LOC = blasthome) to obtain homologous sequences. All the sequences were first clustered using BLASTClust on the website (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/blastclust)27. The parameters included: (1) sequence length to be covered, 75% and (2) percent identity threshold, 40%. As a result, 907 clusters were obtained, and the representative sequences of the clusters were then used for construction of sequence similarity network (SSN) from the website (http://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-est/stepa.php)28. The network parameters used were: (1) E-value, 5; (2) fraction, 1; and (3) alignment score, 6. Sequence analyses of CCHs The 1694 similar proteins of YtkR7 were obtained using YtkR7 (I3NN73) as query from the InterPro website (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence-search)20.

Sequence logo analysis Multiple sequence alignment was executed using Clustal Omega on the website (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/), and the alignment results were used to create the sequence logo on the website (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi)29. Protein expression and purification DNA isolation and manipulation in E. coli or Streptomyces strains were performed following standard methods30. PCR amplifications were carried out on a Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were cloned into the pMD19-T vector cloning kit (Takara Biotechnology (Dalian) Co., Ltd), confirmed by DNA sequencing (Shanghai Biosune Biotech Co., Ltd (China)), digested with Nde I and Hin dIII/Xho I, and ligated into the final expression vector pET-28a(+) and pET-37b(+), respectively. The resulting recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein overexpression. When the cultures (400 mL) in LB media supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg mL−1) were grown to an OD600 of 0.6–1.0 at 37 °C, protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, followed by further incubation for 18–24 h at 16 °C. Then, the cultures were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm 4 °C. The E. coli cell pellet was resuspended in ~30 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol, pH 8.0), and the His-tagged proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer’s manual (Qiagen). The eluted protein was desalted using a PD-10 Desalting Column (GE Healthcare, USA) and the purified protein was stored at −80 °C in buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 100–300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0) for further enzymatic assays. Bradford assays were used to determine the concentration of the purified proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis PCR amplifications (18–26 cycles) were carried out using ytkR7 and lin2189 expressing plasmids as template. After gel extraction (Generay Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd), the PCR products were digested by Dpn I and the digested products were directly used to transform E. coli DH5а. Each point mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting site-mutated plasmids were introduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) according to the procedures described above for the wild-type protein expressions. Enzymatic assays The YTM (or CC-1065) hydrolysis reaction was carried out in 50 mM NaH2PO4 buffer containing 5–10 µM protein, 25% DMSO, and 100–300 µM YTM (or CC-1065) in a 30 µL system at pH 7.0. The reaction was incubated for 25–45 min at 25 °C, then quenched by mixing with 30 µL DMSO, and finally centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Bacterial growth inhibition assays The E. coli BL21(DE3) strains transformed with recombinant plasmids were induced for expression of CCHs for about 5 h at 16 °C. The resulting cultures were adjusted to the same concentration, and then transferred to fresh LB media in test tube containing IPTG (0.1 mM), kanamycin (50 µg·mL−1), and YTM (or compound 5) with different concentrations to grow about 12–24 h, respectively. Their final E. coli cultures were diluted and the concentrations were measured by the absorbance at 600 nm, respectively. When the plates were used, the adjusted cultures were mixed with 2% low melting temperature agarose containing LB media and then were poured on the LB plates, respectively. In total, 2 µL different concentrations of YTM were dropped on the plate surface for further incubation about 20–36 h. Two independent replicates were conducted for each assay. Cytotoxicity assay for YTM and compound 5 All cell-culture work was conducted in a class II biological safety cabinet. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Jurkat cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence, and then collected, followed by centrifugation (3 min at 1000 rpm). The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in fresh medium, and the concentration of cells was determined using a hemacytometer. The cell suspension was diluted to a concentration of 15,000 cells per 50 μL. The wells of a pre-sterilized 96-well plate were charged with 50 μL per well of the diluted cell suspension. Stock solutions of each compound in DMSO were diluted serially with RPMI-1640 medium (supplemented with FBS), and the resulting 50 μL solutions were added to the wells containing cells to achieve final concentrations of 0.1 nM–1.6 nM of YTM or 0.1 nM–10 μM of compound 5. After incubating at 37 °C and in 5% CO2 for 48 h, 10 μL of CCK-8 (VazymeTM CCK-8 Cell Counting Kit) was added to each well. After incubating at 37 °C and in 5% CO2 for another 4 h, the optical density at 450 nm was read out with a microplate reader and the background was subtracted at 650 nm. Cells incubated with 0.1% DMSO served as control. Three independent replicates were conducted. Construction and complementation of the ytkR7 replacement mutant The ytkR7 gene was inactivated by PCR-targeting method using the spectinomycin resistance cassette (aadA) (R7KO1 and R7KO2 as primers in Supplementary Table 1). To conduct complementation assays, the wild-type ytkR7 or c10R6 controlled by ermE promoter were cloned into the pSET152 plasmid. Conjugation from E. coli S17-1 to Streptomyces was performed according to our previous studies9, 30. Specifically, E. coli S17-1 strains (containing the recombinant plasmids) were gently mixed with the Streptomyces spores, and then the mixture was plated on the IWL-4 solid medium. After incubation at 30 °C for 12–16 h, the antibiotics spectinomycin (or apramycin) and nalidixic acid were added on the plates. Positive clones were identified 5 days later. Production and characterization of the relative metabolites Production of YTM and other relative metabolites was carried out using ISP-2 medium (yeast extract 4 g, malt extract 10 g, glucose 4 g, agar 20 g, and distilled H2O to 1 L, pH 7.2)9. Production of CC-1065 and other relative metabolites by Streptomyces zelensis NRRL 11183 was performed using our optimized medium (dextrin 30 g, fish meal 10 g, cornmeal 30 g, cottonseed meal 30 g, glucose 10 g, Na citrate 2.5 g, MgSO4•7H2O 1 g, CaCO3 5 g, FeSO4•7H2O 0.02 g, KCl 0.5 g, CoCl2•7H2O 0.02 g, Na2HPO4•12H2O 3 g, pH 7.0, and distilled H2O to 1 L). HPLC analysis was conducted on the Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA) with a reverse-phase Alltima C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). The conditions include: Solvent A was H2O and Solvent B was CH3CN; the gradient program was 0–3 min 15% B, 3–6 min 15–40% B, 6–12 min 40% B, 12–19 min 40–55% B, 19–22 min 55–85% B, 22–28 min 85% B, and 28–29 min 15% B; the flow rate was 1 mL min−1 with DAD detector. The crude extracts of fermentation were subjected to the reverse-phase silica gel column chromatography. All the fractions were monitored by HPLC. The desired fractions were further purified by semi-preparative HPLC on a Shimadzu LC-20-AT system. High-resolution ESI-MS analysis was conducted on the 6230B Accurate Mass TOF LC/MS System (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). NMR data were recorded on the Bruker Avance III AV400 (Cryo) spectrometers (Bruker Corporation Co., ltd, Germany) and on the Agilent ProPlus 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). Surface plasmon resonance experiments All experiments were performed in PBS buffer pH 7.4 (NaCl 137 mM, KCl 2.7 mM, Na2HPO4 10 mM, KH2PO4 2 mM, 5% DMSO, and 0.05% Tween 20) on a Biacore T200 System at a flow rate of 30 μL min−1 and 25 °C. YtkR7, Rob, and SbmC proteins were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip at 23,757.5, 14,397.3, and 3827.0 response units (RU), respectively. Crystallization and data collection The lin2189 mutant proteins were purified by one Ni-NTA column and one size exclusion column (Superdex 200 16/600, GE Health Care). Crystals with high qualified diffraction for data collection were first obtained using lin2189 mutant E157A/E185L, which lost the activity of YTM hydrolysis. A mixed solution contains 10% 15 mM YTM solved in DMSO and 1 mM protein was used for incubation and then for crystal growth by sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C. The crystals were further soaked in a reservoir solution containing 10% glycol and 5% 15 mM YTM before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at BL19U1 beamline in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility at the wavelength of 0.97791 Å and processed with the HKL3000 package. Structure determination and refinement The complex structure of lin2189 E157A E185L-YTM was determined by molecular replacement using search model PDB ID 3B49. YTM was added into the structure based on the omit Fo–Fc map and iterative cycles of refinement were carried out using COOT, Refmac, and PHENIX. A random selection of 5% reflections was set aside for cross-validation. PROCHECK and MolProbity were used to access the overall quality of the structural models. All statistics for data collection and structural refinement were listed in Supplementary Table 3. Structure figures were made using PyMol 1.3. Loop filling and refinements Since the loop B was missing in the complex structure, loop refinement protocol in Modeller V9.1031 was used to fulfill and refine this area. A total of 20,000 loops were generated and a conformation with the lowest DOPE (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy) score was chosen for receptor construction. Protein structure preparations All protein models were prepared in Schrodinger suite software under OPLS_2005 force field32. Hydrogen atoms were added to repaired crystal structures according to the physiological pH (7.5) with the PROPKA tool33 in Protein Preparation tool in Maestro34 to optimize the hydrogen bond network. Constrained energy minimizations were conducted on the full-atomic models, with heavy atom coverage to 0.4 Å. Ligand structure preparations All ligand structures were produced in Schrodinger Maestro software34. The LigPrep module in Schrodinger software was introduced for geometric optimization by using OPLS_2005 force field. The ionization states of ligands were calculated with Epik tool35 employing Hammett and Taft methods in conjunction with ionization and tautomerization tools35. Protein–ligand docking The docking of a ligand to the receptor was performed using Glide36. Cubic boxes centered on the ligand mass center with a radius 10 Å for all ligands defined the docking binding regions. Flexible ligand docking was executed for all structures. Twenty poses per ligand out of 20,000 were included in the post-docking energy minimization. The best scored pose for the ligand was chosen as the initial structure for MD simulations. Molecular dynamics simulations All unbiased MD simulations were performed in Gromacs 5.1.437. All amino acid residues of the protein were modeled according to their protonation state at neutral pH. The protein was centered in a water box with a distance of 16 Å away from the protein. The total number of atoms was approximately 56,000: 54 Na+ and 52 Cl− ions, and about 18,000 water molecules. Amber99SB*-ILDNP38 force field was assigned to the protein, water, and ions, while the ligands were treated by AmberGAFF2 force field39 through ACPYPE tool40. The ligands were submitted to GAUSSIAN 09 program41 for structure optimization at Hartree-Fock 6–31 G* level prior to the generation of force field parameters. All bond lengths of hydrogen atoms in the system were constrained using M-SHAKE42. Van der Waals and short-range electrostatic interactions were cut off at 10 Å. The whole system was heated linearly at constant volume (NVT ensemble) from 0 to 310 K over 400 ps. Ten nanoseconds equilibration was performed at constant pressure and temperature (NPT ensemble; 310 K, 1 bar) using the Nose–Hoover coupling scheme with two temperature groups. Long-range electrostatic interactions were computed by particle mesh Ewald (PME) summation. Finally, 400 ns MD simulations with a time step of 2.0 fs were performed for apo lin2189, lin2189-YTM, and lin2189-product. The MD simulations results were analyzed in Gromacs37 and VMD43. Figures were prepared in PyMOL and Inkscape44. The pKa calculation of both E185 and E157 was done in PROPKA tool33. We extracted 500 structures through the APO MD simulation and used PROPKA33 for calculation. The PCA analysis was performed on the nonbiased MD simulation of APO protein. Metadynamics simulations Free-energy profiles of the systems were calculated by using well-tempered metadynamics in Gromacs 5.1.437 with Plumed 2.1.245 patches. Metadynamics adds a history-dependent potential V(s, t) to accelerate sampling of the specific CVs s(s

2, …, s
m)46. V(s, t) is usually constructed as the sum of multiple Gaussians centered along the trajectory of the CVs (Eq. 1).1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The CVs sample an ensemble at a temperature T + ΔT, which is higher than the system temperature T. Periodically, during the simulation, another Gaussian potential, whose location is dictated by the current values of the CVs, is added to V(s, t)47. In our simulations, the mass center distances between ligands (substrate or product) and E185, and that between loop B and loop C were assigned as two CVs s
1 and s
2, while the width of Gaussians, σ, was set to 0.5 Å. The time interval, τ was 0.09 ps. Well-tempered metadynamics involves adjusting the height, w
j, in a manner that depended on V(s, t) where the initial height of Gaussians w was 0.5 kcal mol−1, the simulation temperature was 310 K, and the sampling temperature ΔT was 298 K. The convergence of our simulations was judged by using the free energy difference between states X and A at 10 ns intervals. State X is a reference state, while A is the state after additional biases added to state X. Once the resulting data remained stable over time, the simulation was considered as converged. Each metadynamics simulation lasted 120 ns, and the results were analyzed upon convergence. Interaction fingerprint calculations The interaction fingerprint between protein and ligand was done with PLIP tool48. We first extracted snapshots of the final 20 ns MD simulation. We then used PLIP to convert protein−ligand coordinates into a bit-string fingerprint (TIFP) registering the corresponding molecular interaction pattern. TIFP fingerprints have been calculated for 500 protein−ligand complexes for each case, enabling a broad comparison of relationships between interaction pattern similarities and ligand or binding site pairwise similarities49. In this work we kept the default parameters of PLIP and focused on three types of interactions: H-bond interaction, π stacking and hydrophobic contact. Data availability The atomic coordinates and structural factors of lin2189 E157A/E185L and lin2189 E157A/E185L-YTM have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 5 × 5 R and 5 × 5 M, respectively.
