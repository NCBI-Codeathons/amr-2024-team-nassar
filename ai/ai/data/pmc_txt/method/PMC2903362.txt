EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES   Cells, Reagents, and Equipment All oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by MWG-Biotech. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, T4 DNA ligase was from Fermentas Life Sciences, and cloned Pfu DNA polymerases were from Stratagene. The following reagents were purchased from Sigma: AcCoA, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent), CHES, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 4000, polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000, potassium chloride (KCl), l-selenomethionine (l-SeMet), trisodium citrate, Tris, sodium acetate, and sodium fluoroacetate. Amino acids used for cell cultures were from DUCHEFA Biochemie. FAcCoA was synthesized as described previously (7). An ÅKTA FPLC system and a HiLoad Superdex S200 column (16 × 60 cm) (GE Healthcare) were used for gel filtration purification of proteins. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Sigma). DNA sequencing was performed in the Department of Biochemistry DNA Sequencing Facility (University of Cambridge) on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA analyzer. Escherichia coli NovaBlue or DH10B cells were used for cloning, and E. coli RosettaTM (DE3)pLysS cells were used for protein expression. Cloning of FlK and Mutants The cloning of the recombinant His-tagged wild-type FlK (WtFlK) in pET28a(+) (Novagen) was described in our previous study (7). Mutants of FlK each containing a single amino acid mutation were created by PCR using the WtFlK-expressing plasmid as a template. For each mutant, two PCR amplifications were carried out using two primer pairs: T7-27/3′-5′ primers for PCR-1 and T7T-27/5′-3′ primers for PCR-2. The T7–27 primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAATTGT-3′) and T7T-27 primer (5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAG CGGTGGCAGCA-3′) hybridize, respectively, to the upstream or downstream regions of the multicloning site in pET28a(+). Mutations were created in either the 3′-5′ primer or the 5′-3′ primer or both, depending on the specific design for each individual mutant. PCR was carried out using cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min plus a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, purified by gel extraction (Qiagen), and inserted into pET28a(+) vector between the NdeI and BamHI sites. The inserts of the recombinant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Constructs with the correct inserts were introduced into E. coli RosettaTM (DE3)pLysS competent cells (Novagen) for protein expression. Expression and Purification of FlK and FlK Mutants An overnight culture (10 ml) from a single colony harboring the desired plasmid was used for inoculation of 1 liter of fresh LB medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml). The culture was incubated at 37 °C, 250 rpm until A600 = 0.5–0.8 was reached. Overexpression of the proteins was induced by 0.2–0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 16 °C with shaking at 220 rpm before being harvested by centrifugation. For incorporation of l-SeMet into FlK, 1 liter of fresh medium containing 6 g of Na2HPO4, 3 g of KH2PO4, 1 g of NH4Cl, 1 g of NH4Cl, 0.5 g of NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 4 g of glucose, 0.5 mg of thiamine vitamin B1, and 50 mg of kanamycin was inoculated with cells from a 10-ml overnight culture and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. When the cell density reached A600 = 0.3–0.5, a mixture of l-lysine (100 mg), l-phenylalanine (100 mg), l-threonine (100 mg), l-leucine (50 mg), l-isoleucine (50 mg), l-valine (50 mg), and l-SeMet (50 mg) was added into the culture, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 37 °C. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce protein overexpression overnight at 16 °C, 200 rpm. The cells were broken by sonication for 4 min (1 s on, 10 s off) to release overexpressed recombinant protein. The supernatant of the cell lysate was applied to a His-Bind® column (Novagen) charged with Co2+ ions. Nonspecific proteins were removed by washing the column with washing buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), and the recombinant protein was eluted with elution buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The buffer containing the purified proteins was exchanged with a buffer containing 100 mm KCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and concentrated at 4 °C to a total volume of 1–2 ml. The His tag of the proteins was removed by thrombin (restriction grade; Novagen) digestion at room temperature overnight. The tag-free proteins were further purified by gel filtration on an ÄKTA Explorer FPLC system using a HiLoadTM 16/60 SuperdexTM 200 Prep Grade column and a mobile phase containing 100 mm KCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE. The protein masses were confirmed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry on a 2.0 × 250-mm Jupiter 5-μm C4 column (Phenomenex) using a Finnigan LCQ (Thermo Finnigan) coupled with an HP1100 high pressure liquid chromatography system (Agilent) with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and the following mobile phase gradient: 0–5 min, 35–45% B; 5–25 min, 45–75% B; 25–30 min, 75–95% B (buffer A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; buffer B: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). Enzymatic Assays The thioesterase activity of FlK and its mutants on FAcCoA was measured by monitoring spectrophotometrically the increase in absorbance at 412 nm due to the reaction of released CoASH with 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid with a CARY 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) as described previously (7). All assays were performed at 25 °C in a total volume of 0.5 ml in a spectrophotometer cuvette with a 1-cm light path. Preparation of Fluoroacetyl Carba(dethia)-pantetheine and Fluoroacetyl Oxa(dethia)-pantetheine To prepare fluoroacetyl carba(dethia)-pantetheine (FAcCPan), monofluorination of (O,O′-diacetyl)-malonyl carba(dethia)-pantetheine methylester with SelecfluorTM was carried out, followed by base-catalyzed loss of the protecting groups and concomitant deprotection and decarboxylation of the malonyl moiety. Fluoroacetyl oxa(dethia)-pantetheine (FAcOPan) was obtained from 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide coupling of O,O′-isopropylidene-oxa(dethia)-pantetheine with sodium fluoroacetate, followed by acetal deprotection with Dowex 50-X8-400. Crystallization of SeMet FlK in the Apo-form The crystallization trials with the SeMet FlK protein at a concentration of 20 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm KCl, pH 7.5, were carried out using a Cartesian HONEYBEETM 81 crystallization robot (Genomic Solutions), and protein crystallization was screened using the crystallization conditions from SM1 (Nextal) and the Classics (Qiagen) crystallization solution kits. To each reservoir of 96-well CrystalQuick crystallization plates with square sitting drop position (Molecular Dimensions) were added 100 μl of the crystallization solution and 100 nl of protein solution. The best crystals appeared after approximately 1 week in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and 20% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000. Crystallization of Wild-type FlK (WtFlK) and Its Mutants (T42SFlK and T42AFlK) in Complex with Acetate (Ac) and FAc Initially, crystallization trials were carried out using hanging drop vapor diffusion at 293 K. The protein at 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl was screened against mother liquor solutions from the Classics suite (Qiagen) and kept at 20 °C. The initial crystals were obtained in 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. After optimization, the best crystals were obtained with protein at 5 mg/ml in the same crystallization condition. The drops comprised 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of crystallization solution, and the crystals appeared after 3 or 4 days. To crystallize the FlK in complex with FAc, the sodium acetate present in the crystallization solution was replaced by 0.2 m sodium fluoroacetate. The crystals for both complexes were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen to perform the data collection after soaking in cryoprotectant solution composed of 25–30% ethylene glycol and 75–70% well solution. Both mutants (T42SFlK and T42AFlK) and WtFlK were crystallized under the same conditions. Crystallization of T42SFlK in Complex with AcCoA After ∼6 months, crystals of T42SFlK·AcCoA complex grew in conditions similar to those for the WtFlK·Ac complex except where the acetate was replaced with 20 mm AcCoA. Crystallization of WtFlK in Complex with Analogues of Fluoroacetyl Pantetheine The protein was incubated with 5 mm either FAcCPan or FAcOPan. Initial trials were carried out using a Cartesian HONEYBEETM 81 crystallization robot (Genomic Solutions), and the protein was screened using the crystallization conditions from SM1 (Nextal), Classics, pHclear, and pHclear II (Qiagen) crystallization solution kits. In each reservoir of the 96-well CrystalQuick crystallization plate with square sitting drop position (Molecular Dimensions), 100 μl of the crystallization solution was added. The drops contained 100 nl of the reservoir solution and 100 nl of protein solution at 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm KCl, pH 7.5. The best hits without acetate appeared in a condition that comprised 100 mm CHES, pH 9.5, and 1 m trisodium citrate. After optimization, the best crystals were obtained in a condition containing 100 mm CHES, pH 9.5, and 0.8 m trisodium citrate with a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in the presence of 10 mm FAcCPan or FAcOPan. Data Collection and Structure Determination Data for apo-form WtFlK and SeMet FlK were collected at beamline ID14.4, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The data sets were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (version 1.97) (17). The data were truncated and converted to structure factors using TRUNCATE (18) from the CCP4 suite (19). X-ray data for complexes of WtFlK·FAc, T42AFlK·FAc, T42SFlK·AcCoA, WtFlK·FAcCPan, and WtFlK·FAcOPan were collected at the Swiss Light Source, and the WtFlK·Ac, T42SFlK·Ac, and T42SFlK·FAc were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The data sets were processed using the program Mosflm (20) and scaled by SCALA (21). The structure of SeMet FlK in its apo-form was solved using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and the Phenix program (22), and the other structures were solved by molecular replacement using the apo-structure as probe search in the program AMoRe (23) in the CCP4 suite (19). The refinement was carried out using the program REFMAC 5.2 (24). Visual inspection and water addition were performed using XtalView/xfit (25) and Coot (26). The quality of the model was assessed using PROCHECK (27). The figures were made using PyMOL (28).
