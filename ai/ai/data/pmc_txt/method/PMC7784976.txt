Materials and methods Microbial strains and plasmids Microbial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Streptomyces iranensis mutants For deleting genes of S. iranensis the method described by Netzker et al. [20] was essentially followed. Oligonucleotides applied for gene deletion are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Production and purification of azalomycin F from S. iranensis To obtain samples of the azalomycin F complex from S. iranensis, 50 mL of TSBY [21] were inoculated with 5 × 108 spores and the bacteria were incubated for 4 days at 28 °C at 180 rpm. The entire culture was centrifuged to separate the biomass from the culture supernatant. After lyophilisation of the biomass, the content of the pellet was extracted twice with 50 mL methanol at 60 °C. Both extraction solutions were combined and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and dissolved in 2 mL 75% (v/v) aqueous methanol (MeOH(aq)). The extract was subsequently loaded onto an N-vinylpyrrolidone-divinylbenzene copolymer resin SPE column (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), washed with 50% (v/v) MeOH(aq) and eluted with 70% (v/v) MeOH(aq) to obtain purified azalomycin F complex. The eluent was reduced to dryness, dissolved in pure MeOH, and 5 μL were loaded onto an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for analysis. The chromatographic system consisted of an UltiMate 3000 binary rapid-separation liquid chromatograph with photodiode array detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany). The MS was performed on an LTQ XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ion source. The sample was analyzed on a 150 mm by 4.6 mm Accucore reversed-phase (RP)-MS column with a particle size of 2.6 μm (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with the following gradient: 0.1% (v/v) HCOOH-MeCN/0.1% (v/v) HCOOH–H2O 0/100, increased to 80/20 in 15 min and then to 100/0 in the following 20 min, held at 100/0 for 2 min, and reversed to 0/100 in 2 min, with detection range at 190–400 nm. For the azalomycin F-deficient mutants, cultivation, extraction, and analysis of azalomycin F are described in the Supplementary Methods Section 1.3. Sample preparation for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-IMS) MALDI-IMS was carried out on indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glass slides (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Slides were sterilized over a Bunsen burner and 3 mL of 1% (w/v) TAP [22] agar were spread onto the slide for S. iranensis monoculture. For co-cultivation, 1.5 mL 1% (w/v) TAP agar was spread onto one half of the ITO glass slide and allowed to solidify. The other half was covered with TAP agar, containing submerged C. reinhardtii. For this purpose, a C. reinhardtii culture was centrifuged at 3500 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in liquid TAP agar with a temperature of about 35 °C to yield an OD750 of 2. This suspension was then added to the other side of the slide and allowed to solidify. Finally, 15 µL S. iranensis mycelium, prewashed in PBS, was set between both agar sides. The slides were incubated at 26 °C and a light intensity of 30 µE m−2 s−1 in petri dishes for 5 days and subsequently dried in a hybridization oven at 37 °C for 48 h. For MALDI-IMS analysis, see Supplementary Methods 1.5. Chemotaxis assay Chemotaxis was measured by counting C. reinhardtii cells that migrated into glass capillaries loaded with a potential attractant [23, 24]. Three microliters capillaries (Drummond Microcaps®, Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA, USA) were loaded with TAP supplemented with 10 g/L glucose, 0.5 g/L MgCl2∙7H2O, 1 mL/L trace elements, 10 mL/L 0.5 M arginine, 3 mL/L 3 mM FeSO4 and 3 mL/L 0.1% (w/v) p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) as control. Equally supplemented supernatant of an A. nidulans culture grown in TAP medium served as experimental sample and as a negative control PBS was used. The capillaries were placed upright into a 2 mL reaction tube. For each sample, three technical replicates were tested. 100 µL of a C. reinhardtii suspension with an OD750 of 4 were placed at the bottom of each 2 mL reaction tube. When attracted, the C. reinhardtii cells had to swim against gravity. Incubation was carried out at 26 °C in the dark for 5 h. After incubation, the capillaries were cleaned with a paper towel to remove attached cells, and the content was transferred to 27 µL of PBS + 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde. C. reinhardtii cells which had migrated into the capillaries were counted using a Neubauer counting chamber. Chlorophyll quantification assay The assay was performed in order to assess the chlorophyll content within a C. reinhardtii suspension and to estimate the viability of the cells 24 h after treatment with azalomycin F. Each well was inoculated with 100 µL TAP supplemented with glucose, MgSO4, PABA, FeSO4, trace elements, and arginine (see Supplementary Information 1.1) and containing 104 conidia of A. nidulans. The 96-well plates were incubated at 37 °C for 16–18 h in a plate shaker with 1000 rpm. Then, 100 µL of a C. reinhardtii suspension with an OD750 of 2 was added to each well and fluorescence was measured (excitation 480 nm, emission 684 nm) on a Tecan Infinite M200 pro microplate reader (Tecan Trading AG, Männedorf, Switzerland). To allow C. reinhardtii to migrate into the mycelium, the plate was incubated for 5 h at 26 °C, 120 rpm and 30 µE m−2 s−1. Then, 200 ng azalomycin F were added and the fluorescence was measured again to determine the values for the start of the treatment. Incubation was continued for 24 h before measuring fluorescence using an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and measuring emission at 684 nm. Co-cultivation chamber experiments Co-cultivation chambers were assembled as previously reported by Paul et al. [25]. The cultivation chambers were separated by a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with a pore size of 0.1 µm. Each chamber was filled with 250 mL TAP supplemented with glucose, MgSO4, PABA, FeSO4, trace elements, and arginine (see Supplementary Information 1.1). C. reinhardtii was inoculated to obtain a final OD750 of 0.1 and A. nidulans mycelium was inoculated from a Miracloth-filtered overnight culture. The chambers were incubated at 26 °C, 80 rpm and 30 µE m−2 s−1. OD750 measurement was conducted on SERVA Nanophotometer Pearl (SERVA Heidelberg, Germany). After 24 h, 12.5 mL of 20% (w/v) glucose, 0.5 g/L MgSO4∙7H2O, 750 µL of 0.1% (w/v) PABA, 750 µL of 10 mM FeSO4, and 2.5 mL of 0.5 M L-arginine were added to each half of the co-cultivation chamber. A. nidulans dry mass was determined by filtering the mycelium after the experiment and drying it for 7 days at 60 °C. Protection of C. reinhardtii by external polar lipids Phosphatidylinositol sodium salt from soybean was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Cardiolipin (CL), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DPPG), 16:0-i15:0 phosphatidylcholine (PC), d18:1/18:0 C18 glucosyl(β)ceramide (GC), and extract of polar lipids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). DPPG, CL, and GC were dissolved in 95:5 methanol:water to obtain a 0.5 mg/mL stock solution. PC was dissolved in 95:5 methanol:water to obtain a 4 mg/mL stock solution. YE was purchased as a 25 mg/mL solution in chloroform. For application of the lipids to C. reinhardtii, the solvent was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The lipids were dissolved in a culture of C. reinhardtii with an OD750 of 2. The final concentrations of the lipids were chosen similar to Xu et al. [26]. To dissolve the lipids in TAP, the cultures were incubated in a ThermoMixer® (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 30 °C and rapid shaking for 30 min. Afterwards, the cultures were incubated in 24 well plates at 26 °C, 120 rpm and 30 µE m−2 s−1. Autofluorescence was measured after 24 h of incubation as described for the chlorophyll quantification assay.
