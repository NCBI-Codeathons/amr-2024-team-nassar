Methods Strains and media Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 was maintained and cultivated to prepare genomic DNA according to
[12]. Streptomyces coelicolor ΔvanRS was gently donated by Hee-Jeon Hong, University of Cambridge, UK
[16], Streptomyces lividans TK24 and Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10595 were a gift from Mervyn Bibb, John Innes Institute, Norwich, UK
[14]. Streptomyces spp. strains were maintained as spores in 10% (v/v) glycerol and propagated in MYM and SFM agar media
[14]. For growing ex-conjugants containing pIJ86, pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn, pIJ86ΩN-vanYn and pIJ86ΩvanYn, agar plates were added with 50 μg/mL of apramycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Agar plates were incubated at 28°C. Liquid media for streptomycetes were YEME -containing in (w/v) 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% bacto-peptone, 0.3% oxoid malt extract, 1% glucose in deionized water, pH 7.0- and BTSB -containing in (w/v) 10% sucrose, 1% yeast extract, 1% glucose, 0.5% NaCl, 0.5% soybean meal, 1.7% tryptone and 0.25% K2HPO4 in deionized water, pH 7.0. All medium components were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy), unless otherwise stated. Colonies were picked up from agar plates and inoculated into 300 mL baffled flasks containing 50 mL of YEME or BTSB. Flask cultures were incubated on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm and 28°C. Media and culture conditions for E. coli were described in
[12]. E. coli DH5α was used as host for plasmid construction. Escherichia coli ET12567/pUZ8002
[5] was used as non-methylating plasmid donor strain for intergeneric conjugation with Streptomyces spp. Cells were propagated in Luria-Bertani (LB) (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) broth at 37°C. Plasmids pIJ86 (gift from Mervyn Bibb) was used as a multi-copy vector for heterologous expression in Streptomyces spp.
[12]. Plasmids pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn and pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn were constructed as follow. Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche, Milan, Italy) was used to amplify vanYn using genomic DNA of Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 as template with oligonucleotide primers vanY004Fw (5′-ATAGGATCCCCAGACTGGAGGAGAGGGATGAGGAGAAGCGAGGGTGAC-3′) and vanY004Rev (5′-GATAAGCTTCTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGACCCGGCCCCCGTTCCGGCT-3′) that introduced a C-terminal tag of six histidine residues and the HindIII and BamHI (Roche, Milan, Italy) restriction sites, respectively, into the PCR product, allowing insertion into the multiple cloning site of the multicopy expression vector pIJ86. The vanYn with a N-terminal tag of six histidines was produced using as oligonucleotide primers vanY003Fw (5′-ATATTTGGATCCATGCACCACCACCACCACCACAGGAGAAGCGAGGGTGACGAC-3′) and vanY003Rev (5′-GATAAGCTTCCCGTGCCCTAGCTAGACCCGGCCCCCGTTCCGGCT-3′) that introduced HindIII and BamHI restriction sites. The vanYn without any tag was produced using as oligonucleotide primers vanY86Fw (5′-ATGGATCCCAGACTGGAGGAGAGGGATG-3′) and vanY86Rev (5′-GATAAGCTTCGATCCTGGAGTTCGTCTTC-3′) that introduced BamHI and HindIII restriction sites
[12]. The PCR products were purified, digested with HindIII and BamHI, and ligated with pIJ86 vector that had similarly been digested, to produce pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn, pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn and pIJ86ΩvanYn. These vectors with vanYn transcribed from the strong constitutive ermE* promoter
[14] were used to transform E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 cells. Intergeneric conjugation Intergeneric conjugation was performed according to a modified protocol from
[5,14]. In brief, a culture of the donor E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 containing the selected plasmid was grown in 10 mL LB supplemented with 50 μg/mL apramycin, 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and 50 μg/mL kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) to an OD600nm of 0.4. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with an equal volume of LB, and resuspended in 1 mL of LB. For each conjugation approximately 108Streptomyces spp. spores, collected from agar plates in sterile glycerol, were added to 500 μL 2X YT broth
[14], heat shocked at 50°C for 10 minutes and then allowed to cool. 500 μL of E. coli cells were added to 500 μL of heat-shocked spores and mixed briefly. Mixture was plated out on SFM or MYM agar added with 10 mM MgCl2 and incubated for 20 hours at 30°C. Plates were overlaid with 1 mL of water containing 500 μg/mL nalidixic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and 50 μg/mL apramycin and were incubated at 30°C until colonies appear. Colony PCR and sequencing The presence of pIJ86ΩvanYn, pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn or pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn was checked by colony PCR and DNA sequencing of ex-conjugants. Single colonies were transferred onto DNA medium
[14]. Plates were incubated at 30°C overnight. Mycelium was scraped from the plates using a sterile toothpick and was introduced into 50 μL 100% v/v DMSO in a 1.5 mL tube. The tube was shaken vigorously for 1–2 hours and then centrifuged: 2.5 μL of the supernatant were used for PCR. For control, 1 μL of DNA samples were mixed with 1.5 μL DMSO. One initial step of 10 minutes at 95°C was included in the PCR program to ensure the complete cell lysis. The PCR was performed for 30 cycles as follows: 95°C for 45 seconds, 56°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 1 minute. vanY004Fw, vanY004Rev, vanY003Fw and vanY003Rev, vanY86Fw and vanY86Rev were used as oligonucleotide primers. VanYn expression Recombinant Streptomyces spp. were grown aerobically in 100 mL YEME and BTSB media added with apramycin (50 μg/mL) in 500 mL Erlenmayer flasks for different time intervals (up to 196 h) at 28°C and 200 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 39000 × g for 15 minutes and washed three times with water. The supernatant (named “extracellular fraction”) was collected and precipitated with the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) method. TCA precipitation was performed adding 1/10 (v/v) of 100% TCA (w/v) to an appropriate medium volume and vortexed for 15 seconds, placed on ice for 15 minutes and then centrifugated at 14,000 × g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed and discarded. The pellet was washed twice with 100 μL of pure acetone and then air dried for about 60 minutes. Washed cells were suspended in 10 mL of 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.4 M sucrose and 6.7 mg of lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). After 6 hours of incubation at 37°C, the mixture was centrifuged at 12800 × g for 10 minutes, obtaining spheroplasts clearly distinguishable at the optical microscopic observation (40X, Zeiss Primo Star microscope, Arese, Italy). The supernatant thus obtained was named “cell wall fraction”. The spheroplasts were washed with 0.4 M sucrose and then 5 mL of water was added to burst the spheroplasts. The suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 30 minutes. The supernatant and the precipitate were named as “cell-free soluble extract” and “cell-free insoluble fraction”, respectively. Scale up in 3-L reactor Flask cultures of recombinant Streptomyces spp. grown in YEME and apramycin (50 μg/mL) for 48–72 hours were used to inoculate - at 2.5% (v/v) - 3-L P-100 Applikon glass reactor (height 25 cm, diameter 13 cm) equipped with a AD1030 Biocontroller and AD1032 motor, containing 2 L YEME and apramycin (50 μg/mL). Cultivations in fermenter were carried out for 168 hours at 28°C, with stirring at 500 rpm (corresponding to 1.17 m/s of tip speed) and 2 L/min aeration rate. Dissolved oxygen (measured as % of the initial pO2 value) was monitored using an Ingold polarographic oxygen electrode. The pH values of culture broths were monitored using a pH meter. Foam production was controlled by adding Antifoam SE-15 (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) through an antifoam sensor. VanYn purification For protein purification, cultures of recombinant S. venezuelae grown in YEME medium were harvested and centrifuged at 39000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Cells were sonicated in a buffer solution 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 10 μg/mL DNAseI (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), 0.19 mg/mL PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and 0.7 μg/mL pepstatine (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), for 15 cycles of 30 seconds each on ice. After a centrifugation at 39000 × g for 60 min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected. N-His6-VanYn was purified by affinity chromatography onto a HiTrap chelating affinity column (1.6 × 2.5 cm, 5 mL, GE Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy) equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 30 mM imidazole and 300 mM NaCl, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After extensive washing, the bound protein was eluted with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mM NaCl and 300 mM imidazole
[17]. For C-His6-tagged VanYn, 6 M urea was added to the equilibration buffer as denaturant; in order to refold the protein bound to the column, a linear gradient from 6 to 0 M of urea (2 mL/min) was performed before starting the elution phase
[29]. Fractions containing pure recombinant VanYn were loaded on PD10 Sephadex G25 column (Ge Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy) equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE (using 15% polyacrylamide gels and staining with Coomassie brilliant blue) and Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was estimated using the extinction coefficient at 280 nm (45258 M-1 cm-1) determined by urea denaturation and the theoretical extinction coefficient based on amino acid sequence. Western blot analysis Following electrophoresis of proteins from bacterial cell fractions (corresponding to 100 μL of culture) or affinity-purified fractions and the transfer to a nitrocellulose sheet (GE Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy), the membrane was incubated with 1:1000 (v/v) His•Tag® Antibody HRP Conjugate Kit (Novagen, Milan, Italy) in alkalin-casein solution 1% (v/v). The immunorecognition was visualized by ECL Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy). The quantitative analysis was performed using the bioinformatics program Quantity One (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy) and C-His6-VanYn from E. coli as standard protein. For molecular mass determination, PageRuler™ Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) markers were used. Protein content in each fraction was assayed by Biuret method and SDS-PAGE analysis (Additional file

2: Figure S2). Alkaline extraction of d,d-carboxypeptidase All manipulations were carried out at 0 to 4°C. Cells at different growth phases were harvested and suspended in 2 ml per gram of cells of physiological solution (0.9% (v/v) NaCl). The mycelium was fragmented by mild sonication and cells were collected by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 15 minutes. Alkaline extractions were carried out by suspending the cell suspension in ice-cold distilled water containing the proteinase inhibitors (0.19 mg/ml PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan Italy) and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatine (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan Italy) and then bringing the suspension to pH 12 by adding an appropriate volume of 2.5 N NaOH. After centrifugation (28,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C), the supernatants were neutralized to pH 7 by the addition of 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.4)
[30]. d,d-dipeptidase and d,d-carboxypeptidase assays Enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the release of d-Ala from Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, acetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala and d-Ala-d-Ala by a d-amino acid oxidase/peroxidase coupled colorimetric assay (i) or by reaction with a fluorescent reagent (ii). All substrates were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. One unit of d,d-carboxypeptidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 μmol of d-Ala per min. (i) D-Amino acid oxidase/peroxidase assay
[17,18]. Reaction mixtures contained 10 mM of the substrate (Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, or acetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala or d-Ala-d-Ala), 5 mM of the peroxidase colorimetric substrate 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP, from Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), 3 U/mL RgDAAO (d-amino acid oxidase from Rhodotorula gracilis[18]), 7.5 U/mL horseradish peroxidase (HRP from Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), 6 mM phenol in 50 mM 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane (pH 7.4) in a final volume of 1 mL. At 25°C, 40 μg of recombinant VanYn or the amount of cell wall alkaline extract correspondent to 50 mg of cells, or the soluble fraction or the supernatant, was added to the reaction mixture and the increase in absorbance (ΔAbs/min) at 510 nm was measured for the test sample as well as for the control to which no VanYn was added. A molar extinction coefficient for chinonemine of 6.58/mM cm was used. (ii) Fluorimetric o–phthaldialdehyde (OPTA) method
[20]. Reaction mixtures contained 10 mM Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, 40 μg of recombinant VanYn in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in a final volume of 200 μL. After 10 minutes at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 250 mM HCl followed by 750 μL of water. Enzymatically released d-Ala was detected by the addition of 100 μL of fluoraldehyde (OPTA) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) to 100 μL of the reaction mix, followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min. 800 μL of water was added and 200 μL was removed: the fluorescence intensity was measured (λex = 340 nm; λem = 455 nm) in a fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan Infinite® 200 Pro, Milan, Italy). Assays were quantified from a standard curve prepared with known amounts of d-Ala. Circular dichroism measurements Far-UV CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-715 (Jasco Europe, Cremella, Italy) spectropolarimeter in the 195–250 nm wavelength range. Measurements were made in quartz cuvettes of 1 mm pathlength, employing protein solutions of 0.1 mg/mL, and were corrected for buffer contribution. Secondary structure fractions were calculated from deconvolution of the CD spectra using the program K2D2 (http://www.ogic.ca/projects/k2d2/)
[31]. Determination of the biological activity: the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of teicoplanin and vancomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) to S. venezuelae containing pIJ86 or pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn or pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn was determined in MYM agar added with 50 μg/mL apramycin and increasing concentrations of glycopeptides. The inoculum was 106 cfu/mL (after mycelium sonication with Sonics Vibracell VCX 130 – power 130 Watt, 230 Volt, 50–60 Hertz, frequency 20 Hz 5 minutes of sonication, 20 seconds for each cycles with 90% of amplitude), and plates were incubated at 28°C until colonies appeared. MIC was the lowest concentration of the antibiotic that inhibits the visible growth of the recombinant S. venezuelae strains
