Materials and Methods Bacterial strains S. clavuligerus DSM 41826 (DSM, Germany) and
S. clavuligerus PTCC 1705 (Iranian Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Iran) were used
in this study. Escherichia coli (E. coli) XL1-Blue
was also used in this study. The Streptomyces
strains were grown in defined conditions as described
previously (37). A suspension of Streptomyces
spores was prepared in 20% (v/v) glycerol
and stored at -20℃ (38). Cultures for the isolation
of chromosomal DNA were prepared by inoculating
100 ml of yeast extract medium (YEM) with
100 µl of spore suspension. The YEM medium
was prepared as described previously (37). Luriabertani
(LB) agar medium (that contained per liter:
10 g of trypton, 5 g of bacto-yeast extract, 10 g
of NaCl and 17 g of agar; pH= 7.5) supplemented
with Ampicillin (100 µg/ml), whenever required,
was used for the propagation of E. coli at 37℃.
The bacterial pellet was stored in 20% glycerol at
-20℃. Vector The pBs SK reproduced from Stratagene Catalogue
was used as the vector in this study. Primers OLIGO® version 5.0 software (39) was used for
designing all primers. The entire coding region
of the gene was considered for primer selection.
Accession number AJ000671.1, GI:2764535 (or
U87786.2, GI:9280818) was used for obtaining
the claR sequence. These accession numbers are
based on S. clavuligerus ATCC 2706. This strain
is the same as S. clavuligerus DSM 738, as mentioned
in the NCBI. One set of primers (claR1)
was designed for nested PCR (F: 5'GCC TGG
AGC AGA TGG AG 3'and R: 5'AGG TGC TGT
CGC TGG TCT 3'). Two primers (claR2) were designed
for isolation of the claR gene from genomic
DNA of S. clavuligerus (F: 5'CAT GGA TCC GTA
TCT GTA CC 3' and R: 5'TAG GAT CGA TTC
CGA AGC 3'). These primers were subjected to
modification at each 5' end in order to have two
recognition sites for BamHI and ClaI (Fig 1). Separation of total genomic DNA from Streptomyces Total genomic DNA was isolated from the liquid
culture of Streptomyces using the High Pure PCR
Template Preparation Kit (Roche; Cat. No.1 796
828). The amount of DNA was quantified by gel
electrophoresis and spectrophotometric analysis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR ) The reaction mixture for PCR amplification
was prepared as follows: forward primer, 20
pM; reverse primer, 20 pM; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 4 µl; 10×PCR buffer without MgSO4
(200 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM (NH4)2SO4, 100 mM
KCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml bovine serum
albumin (BSA)), 5 µl; MgSO4, 3 µl; deoxynucleoside
triphosphates (dNTPs), 2 µl (10 mM
each dNTP); and H2O, up to 50 µl. A total of 100
ng of chromosomal DNA was added as the template
DNA. The PCR reactions were then carried
out using 0.3 µl (2.5 U/µl) of Pfu polymerase enzyme.
The amplification steps for the main PCR
were as follows: hot start at 95℃ for 5 minutes;
33 cycles of denaturation at 94℃ for 1 minute,
annealing at 60℃ for 1 minute, primer extension
at 72℃ for 4 minutes, and a final extension at
72℃ for 15 minutes. These conditions were set
up for the modified primers. The amplification
procedure was slightly different for the nested
primers. The PCR was carried out normally for
30-35 cycles. The products were visualized by a
standard electrophoresis procedure using 0.7%
(W/V) agarose gels. Restriction endonuclease (RE) digestion Two sets of primers were designed not only to amplify the claR region, but also to integrate one unique
recognition site (BamHI and ClaI) in each end of
the amplified fragments. Digestion was performed
following the recommendations of the manufacturer
(Fermentas, Germany). Required amounts of
DNA samples (0.2-5 µg) were generally digested
with 5-10 units of restriction enzymes (BamHI and
ClaI) in a 10-20 µl final volume of restriction buffer
(10× buffer) for about 1-3 hours in a water bath at
the recommended temperature (normally 37℃). A
sample was run on an agarose gel after incubation
with each enzyme, which ensured that the digestion
was done completely (40). DNA ligation DNA ligation was performed using one unit of T4
DNA ligase (Fermentas, Germany) in the presence
of 1× ligation buffer. The 3:1 molar ratio of insert
to vector was used in order to optimize transformation.
Incubation was done at 16℃ overnight
(40). The products of the ligase reaction (a 20 ng
aliquot from the completed ligase mixture) were
analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2 × 50 ×75 mm
agarose gel (mini gel). Fig1Nucleotide sequence of the claR gene. The main primers have been subjected to a few nucleotide modifications as

chloride method was used (40). An aliquot
(200 µl) of frozen competent cells were slowly
thawed on ice for about 30 minutes. Cells were
gently mixed with DNA and incubated on ice for
30 minutes. The cells were then heat shocked at
42℃ for 90 seconds. They were added to 2 ml LB
(without antibiotic) and incubated at 37℃ for one
hour in a shaking incubator. A total of 100 µl of
transformed cells were spread on the surface of the
LB plate that contained an antibiotic. The plates
were allowed to dry before overnight incubation
at 37℃ (40). Extraction of plasmid DNA from E. coli E. coli DNA was isolated according to the method
described by Holmes and Quigley (40). The overnight
LB culture of E. coli was harvested by centrifugation
(13K rpm, 30 seconds). The pellet was
re-suspended in 350 µl of STET [0.3 M NaCl, 10
mM Tris-HCl (pH= 8.0), 1mM EDTA (pH= 8.0),
0.5% Triton X-100] buffer, and subsequently 25 µl
of freshly prepared lysozyme solution (10 mg/ml
lysozyme in 10 mM TrisCl) was added. The tube
that contained bacterial lysate was placed in a boiling
water bath for 40 seconds before centrifugation
at room temperature (12K rpm, 10 minutes). The
pellet of bacterial cell debris was removed using
a sterile toothpick. Plasmid DNA was precipitated
with cold sodium acetate and isopropanol, washed
with 70% ethanol, and re-dissolved in 50 µl of TE
containing 10 g/ml RNase (40). DNA sequencing DNA sequencing was carried out using the Applied
Biosystem (ABI) system (Bioneer, Italy).
