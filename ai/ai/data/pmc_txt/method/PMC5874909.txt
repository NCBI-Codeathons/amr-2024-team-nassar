MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, isogenic mutants, and cultures. The E. coli strains used in this study were DH10B hosting the pBACpks or the vector (pBeloBAC11) (1). The clbA and clbP mutants, and the mutants complemented with the corresponding plasmids pClbA and pClbP, were described previously (23, 28). The clbH and clbQ mutants were constructed by using the lambda Red recombinase method, with primers AS149 and AS150, and primers IHAPJPN57 and IHAPJPN58. The corresponding complementation plasmids were constructed by cloning into pASK75 (SacI/PstI) the PCR products with primers CPTPNG14 and CPTPNG15 and primers CPTPNG20 and CPTPNG21. The primer sequences can be requested from the corresponding author. The wild-type clinical enterobacterial isolates were E. coli strain SP15 (28), C. koseri strain BAA 895, K. pneumoniae strain CF1, and E. aerogenes strain 64 (2). Bacteria were grown at 37°C in 5 ml of Lennox L broth (LB; Invitrogen) or on LB agar plates. Carbenicillin (50 µg ⋅ ml−1), kanamycin (50 µg ⋅ ml−1), or chloramphenicol (25 µg ⋅ ml−1) was added as required. For DNA cross-linking and HeLa cell infection experiments, bacteria were grown overnight in LB and then diluted 1/20 in prewarmed Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)–25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37°C with 240-rpm agitation to reach the exponential phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD600], 0.4 to 0.5). In vitro DNA cross-linking assay. Plasmid pUC19 DNA linearized with BamHI (TaKaRa) and purified with a QIAquick PCR kit (Qiagen) was stored at −20°C. Calf thymus DNA (Sigma) solubilized in 10 mM Tris–1 mM EDTA (pH 8) was sonicated to reduce the average DNA fragment size to ~1,000 bp and was stored at +4°C. Plasmid or thymus DNA was exposed to bacteria as follows: in a 96-well plate or in 1.5-ml Eppendorf microtubes, 400 ng (or the indicated amount) of DNA was added to 100 µl DMEM–25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen) inoculated with 3 × 106 bacteria pregrown to the exponential phase or in the population numbers given in the text. As controls, DNA was treated with 5 mM MMS (Sigma), 80 µM cisplatin (Sigma), or 150 µM MMC (Sigma) activated with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Following 4 h at 37°C, bacteria were pelleted and the DNA was purified from the supernatant using a Qiagen QIAquick PCR kit. For wild-type enterobacterial strains that release nucleases, the bacteria were grown in DMEM–25 mM HEPES without the target DNA for 3.5 h, and then EDTA (1 mM) and target DNA were added and the mixture was incubated for 40 min at 37°C. Denaturing gel DNA electrophoresis. The protocol was adapted from reference 55. Briefly, 1% agarose gels prepared in 100 mM NaCl–2 mM EDTA (pH 8) solution were soaked in 40 mM NaOH–1 mM EDTA electrophoresis running buffer. DNA was loaded with blue or violet gel loading dye (NEB), and then electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature for 45 min at 1 V/cm and then for 2 h at 2 V/cm. Following neutralization in 150 mM NaCl–100 mM Tris (pH 7.4), DNA was stained with Gel Red (Biotium) and visualized with flat-fielding while avoiding charge-coupled-device (CCD) pixel saturation in a Bio-Rad Chemidoc XRS system. Denaturation-renaturation assay. The experiment was performed as previously described (35). Briefly, 100 ng of DNA was added to a mixture of 250 µl of 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma), 0.4 mM EDTA, and 20mM potassium phosphate (pH 11.7). The fluorescence was measured with a Tecan Infinite Pro microplate reader (excitation wavelength, 525 nm; emission wavelength, 600 nm), and then the samples were heated for 3 min at 96°C and immediately cooled to 22°C, and the fluorescence was measured again. The percentage of DNA renaturation was calculated as the value corresponding to the level of fluorescence measured after denaturation and renaturation divided by the value corresponding to the level of fluorescence measured before denaturation. HeLa cell culture, infection, and in cellulo cross-linking assay. HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) were cultivated in DMEM Glutamax supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) in a 37°C 5% CO2 incubator and were maintained by serial passage. Cell infections were performed as described previously (1). Briefly, 1.5 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates and grown during 24 h. Cells were washed, placed in DMEM–25 mM HEPES medium (Invitrogen), and inoculated with bacteria at the given multiplicity of infection (MOI [the number of bacteria per cell at the onset of infection]). Extracellular double-stranded DNA was added at the indicated concentrations. After a 4-h infection at 37°C, the cells were washed and incubated for 4 h in complete cell culture medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml gentamicin. To examine DNA interstrand cross-links in HeLa cells, 3 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and grown 24 h. Cells were infected during 4 h (MOI = 200) and then washed and immediately collected by trypsinization. Control cells were treated for 4 h with 80 µM cisplatin, with 13 µM MMC supplemented with 5 mM DTT, or with 250 μM MMS. HeLa cell genomic DNA was purified with a Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit. Phospho-H2AX quantification and immunofluorescence analyses. HeLa cells were grown and placed on 96-well plates or 12-well chamber slides. The quantification of p-H2AX was performed as described before (26). Briefly, following fixation with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilization, and blocking, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-S139-phosphorylated H2AX antibodies (Cell Signaling catalog no. 9718). An infrared fluorescent (800-nm-wavelength) secondary antibody (Rockland) was used to detect p-H2AX. DNA was counterstained with RedDot2 (Biotium). DNA and p-H2AX were visualized with an Odyssey infrared imaging scanner (Li-Cor Biosciences). The values representing relative levels of fluorescent units for p-H2AX per cell (as determined by dividing the p-H2AX signal by the DNA signal) were divided by the control values to determine the genotoxic index values. Immunofluorescence analyses for RPA, 53BP1, FANCD2, and S139-phosphorylated H2AX were performed as previously described (56). Briefly, following preextraction with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-0.1% Triton X-100, fixation with 4% formaldehyde, and permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100, the cells were stained with the following primary antibodies: 53BP1 (NB100-304) and FANCD2 (NB100-182) antibodies from Novus Biologicals, Inc., p-H2AX (JBW301) from Merck/Millipore, and RPA32 (NA18) from Calbiochem. Cells were washed and incubated with the secondary antibodies rhodamine Red X (R6394) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse antibody (A11017) or anti-rabbit antibody (A11070) (Invitrogen). DNA was counterstained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Cells were examined with an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon 50i) and counted as positive for focus formation when >10 foci/nucleus were detected. Western blotting. Cells were washed and lysed directly in the cell culture well in 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). The cell lysates were then sonicated and heated for 10 min at 70°C, and aliquots were stored at −20°C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham). Membranes were incubated with the primary ATM (2873), p-ATM (5883), p-ATR, Chk1 (2360), and p-Chk1 (2348) antibodies from Cell Signaling; p-RPA32 (A300-246) antibody from Bethyl; and lamin A/C (SAB4200236) and ATR (SAB4200348) antibodies from Sigma. Secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) were visualized with chemiluminescence Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) and imaged using a ChemiDoc XRS imager and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). ATR inhibition, RNA interference, and survival assay. ATR inhibitor VE-821 (Selleckchem) was used at a final concentration of 10 μM. After 48 h of incubation, cell survival was quantified by the use of a colorimetric assay (57). Briefly, cells were fixed and stained with methylene blue, and then the stain was extracted with 0.1 M HCl and quantified by an optical density reading at 660 nm using a Tecan microplate reader. Gene silencing of HeLa cells was performed by transfection of siRNA (Sigma) using INTERFERin (Polyplus) as described before (56). Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with scrambled (CAUGUCAUGUGUCACAUCU-dTdT) (where "dTdT" represents deoxythymidine dinucleotide) or FANCD2 (AACAGCCAUGGAUACACUUGA-dTdT) siRNA. After 48 h of incubation, cells were replated in 96- or 6-well plates for further treatments at 72 h posttransfection. Clonogenic cell survival was assessed using colony formation (58). ClbS protein purification. BL21(DE3) cells hosting the plasmid pET28a-ClbS-His (27) were grown overnight at 37°C in 50 ml LB–0.4 mM IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside). Bacteria were lysed by sonication in a mixture containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole (pH 8), 200 μg/ml gentamicin, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The cleared lysate was incubated for 1 h with HisPur nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Thermo Scientific) in lysis buffer, washed with a mixture containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, and 60 mM imidazole (pH 8), and eluted in 250 mM imidazole buffer. The eluate was stored at +4°C before use at 400 nM in a 100-μl or 2.5-ml volume for culture experiments. Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 5.0b. P values were calculated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni or Tukey posttests.
