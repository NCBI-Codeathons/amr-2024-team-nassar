Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and General DNA Manipulations The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2. L. antibioticus OH13 and derivatives were routinely grown at 28°C in nutrient broth (NB, 3 g beef extract, 1 g yeast extract, 5 g tryptone, 10 g sucrose, pH 7.0–7.2, in one liter distilled water; without sucrose, NBWS), nutrient agar (NA, 1 L NB with 17 g agar; without sucrose, NAWS), 1/10 tryptic soy broth (TSB). 1/10 TSB medium is more appropriate for myxin production. E. coli strains were routinely grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. Where necessary, media were supplemented with gentamycin (25 or 50 μg/mL). Plasmid preparation and DNA extraction were carried out with Omega kits (Norcross, GA). Strains and plasmids used in this study. Strains or plasmids Description Sources or references. Strains.

Gene Deletion and Complementation The oligonucleotide primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. DNA manipulation was conducted by following the methods described previously (Zhao et al., 2016). Briefly, for gene in-frame deletions, fragments containing the upstream and downstream regions of the target genes were cloned into pJQ200SK (Quandt and Hynes, 1993) and transformed into E. coli DH5α for the construction of gene in-frame deletion constructs. The final constructs were transformed into the competent cells of OH13 wild type or its derivatives by electroporation. The gentamycin-resistant colonies were screened by PCR using primers to identify the single crossover mutants. Then, the single crossover mutants were grown on NAWS medium containing 8% sucrose, which would screen for deletion mutants through a second homologous recombination of the flanking regions. The mutants were verified by PCR using primers. For complementation, the open reading frames (ORFs) of the target genes with their own promoters were cloned into pBBR1-MCS5 (Kovach et al., 1995). The expression constructs were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing and introduced into wild type or corresponding mutants by electroporation. The complementation strains were screened on NAWS medium containing gentamycin and were validated by PCR. Preparation and Analysis of Myxin L. antibioticus OH13 was cultivated for 24 h in a 250 mL flask containing 50 mL NB medium. The seed culture was then transferred into 200 mL 1/10 TSB medium in a 1 liter flask (a total of 50 flasks). The flasks were placed in incubators for 24 h with shaking at 180 rpm at 28°C. Then, the cultures were extracted with equal volumes of ethyl acetate, and the organic phase was evaporated to dryness under vacuum to yield the crude extract. The crude extract was chromatographed over a Sephadex LH-20 column using 1:1 CH2Cl2-MeOH as the elution solvent. The fractions were further purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with CH3CN in H2O (Agilent-C18, 5 μm, 9.4 × 250 mm) under 283 nm with a 4.0 mL/min flow rate. To analyze myxin production in OH13 and its derivatives, equal volume of ethyl acetate was used to extract 1 mL supernatant of cultures grown in 1/10 TSB. The crude extract was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and fully evaporated. Then, the residues were dissolved with 200 μL methanol and prepared for HPLC analysis. To determine the production of intracellular myxin, 1 mL culture grown for 20 h in 1/10 TSB was harvested and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. Supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with 1/10 TSB for twice. The pellets were extracted with 1 mL of ethyl acetate overnight. Then the extract was dissolved in methanol and subjected to HPLC. The detection of phenazines was through HPLC (Agilent SB-C18, 250 × 4.6 mm) with a 1.0 mL/min flow rate. The mobile phase was 20–45% CH3CN in H2O from 0 to 5 min, 45 to 50% CH3CN in H2O from 5 to 19 min, 50 to 60% CH3CN in H2O from 19 to 20 min, 60 to 100% CH3CN in H2O from 20 to 23 min, 100% CH3CN from 23 to 27 min, 100 to 20% CH3CN in H2O from 27 to 28 min, and 20% CH3CN in H2O from 28 to 30 min. Susceptibility Test of L. antibioticus to Phenazines The susceptibility of the OH13 wild type and mutants to phenazines was determined by agar screening tests. Myxin was dissolved in DMSO, whereas PMS was dissolved in water. Liquid precultures of each strain to be tested were grown in NB medium to 1.0 of OD600. Five microliters of cultures were spotted on NA media containing the indicated concentrations of phenazines and incubated at 28°C. After 24 and 48 h of growth, the colonies were imaged using a Canon camera. For the inhibition assays of myxin against Lysobacter strains, bacterial suspensions with OD600 1.0 were 100-fold diluted and then spread on NA plates, and subsequently different concentrations of myxin were dropped on filter papers. RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR Bacterial cells were cultured and harvested at an OD600 of approximately 1.0. RNA extraction was performed using the Omega bacterial RNA extraction kit (Omega biotek, Norcross, GA) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of RNA, A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios were determined by using an Eppendorf BioPhotometer plus. In qPCR analysis, a 250 ng RNA sample was used for genomic DNA elimination and cDNA synthesis by a Vazyme HiScript II Q RT SuperMix (with gDNA wiper) by following the manufacturer’s protocol. Specific primers for qRT-PCR (Supplementary Table S1) were designed by Primer 3 online. The housekeeping gene 16S rDNA was used as a reference. The qPCR analysis was conducted on a Quantstudio 6 Flex system (Applied Biosystems) using ChamQTM SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) with the following cycle profile: 1 cycle at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 34 s, and 1 cycle at 95°C for 30 s, 95°C 60 s, and 95°C for 15 s. The experiment was repeated three times, each time with triplicates. Data were analyzed using the 2–Δ

CT method. Construction of GFP Expressing Strains and Flow Cytometry Analysis Strains expressing GFP under the control of Plex were generated by homologous recombination. The fragment of gfp was integrated into the chromosome of L. antibioticus located in front of the lexA start site. We amplified regions ∼600 bp up and downstream of the gfp insertion locus using OH13 genomic DNA as a template, whereas gfp was amplified from a synthetic plasmid. The fragments were cloned into pJQ200SK using homologous recombination with a pEASY® -Uni Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (TransGen, China). The construct was transferred into the OH13 wild type and LaPhzB mutant strains through electroporation. After twice homologous recombination, the gfp fragment was integrated into the chromosome of L. antibioticus, subsequently obtaining the OH13 (Plex-GFP) and ΔLaPhzB (Plex-GFP) strains. For quantification of lex expression, strains were grown in 1/10 TSB medium for different time periods. The ΔLaPhzB (Plex-GFP) strain was also cultured in 1/10 TSB medium and supplied with different concentrations of myxin when the OD600 reached 0.6. GFP fluorescence was analyzed by detecting the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 10,000 cells with a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (BD FACSJazz). Construction of the Phylogenic Tree The amino acid sequence of LexB was applied to blast research in the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)1 and NCBI. 29 sequences from TCDB and 4 sequences of Lysobacter species from NCBI were downloaded. The amino acid sequences of the RND family proteins related to LexB were aligned, and a neighbor-joining tree was constructed with MEGA 7.0 (Kumar et al., 2016).
