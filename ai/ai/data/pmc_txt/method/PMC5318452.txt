Materials and Methods Bacterial Culture Condition and Production Analysis The isolation of polyketomycin of the wild type (wt) strain S. diastatochromogenes Tü6028 has been described previously (Paululat et al., 1999). The mutant S. diastatochromogenes ΔpokOIV (Daum et al., 2009) contains a deletion in pokOIV, a gene encoding an oxygenase involved in the biosynthesis of polyketomycin. Mycelium of the mutant strain S. diastatochromogenes ΔpokOIV was used to inoculate a 300 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of HA medium (yeast extract 0.4%, malt extract 1%, and glucose 0.4% in 1 liter tap water, pH 7.3). The flask was shaken on a rotary shaker (180 rpm) at 28°C. After 48 h, 3 mL of the pre-culture was used to inoculate a second 300 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of HA medium (main culture). After 6 days foxicin A was isolated. To determine the time dependency of product formation (foxicin A and polyketomycin) the wt strain was grown in 100 mL HA medium for 6 days. Samples were taken after 0, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h of cultivation. To check the influence of iron on the production of foxicin A, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mM of FeCl3 or FeSO4 were added to the production media of S. diastatochromogenes ΔpokOIV. The experiment was done in triplicate. The strain was incubated for 6 days and the culture was extracted and analyzed by HPLC. For quantification, the integrals of the corresponding chromatogram peaks were compared. Isolation of Foxicin A Mycelium was collected by centrifugation and foxicin A was extracted with acetone (2–3 times the volume of the pellet) by shaking at room temperature for 15 min. After removal of the mycelium by filtration, the extract was evaporated. Finally, this mycelium extract combined with the supernatant was extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The solvent was removed by evaporation. The crude extract was separated by solid phase chromatography (Oasis HLB 20/35cc) with increasing methanol content (in 10% increments) in the mobile phase. Foxicin A was obtained in the 65 and 70% methanol fraction, foxicin B and C in the 70 and 80% methanol fraction, and foxicin D in the 80% methanol fraction. After thin-layer chromatography in ethyl acetate: formic acid :water (44:3:3) foxicin A (Rf 0.41) was further purified by semi-preparative HPLC (Agilent Technologies), equipped with a Zorbax B-C18 (9.4 × 150 mm) pre-column and Zorbax B-C18 (9.4 mm × 20 mm) main column with acetonitrile + 0.5% acetic acid as buffer A and water + 0.5% acetic acid as buffer B and a flow rate of 2 mL/min. A 3-min washing step with 50% buffer A was followed by a 7-min linear gradient from 50 to 70% of buffer A where the substance was collected. The eluate was dried and resulted in a violet powder. The method was completed by a 4-min delay with 95% buffer A and a 4-min reequilibration step with 50% buffer A. Analysis of Foxicin by HPLC/MS For analysis, HPLC-MS equipped with a XBridge C18 (3.5 μm; 20 mm × 4.6 mm) precolumn and a XBridge C18 (3.5 μm; 100 mm × 4.6 mm) main column, an UV/visible light detector and a mass spectrometer (Agilent, 1100 Series) was used. A flow rate of 0.5 mL/min was used. A 1-min washing step with 20% buffer A was followed by a 7-min linear gradient from 20 to 60% buffer A and a 16-min linear gradient ranges from 60 to 95% buffer A. After a 5-min delay the method completed with a 1-min gradient from 95 to 20% buffer A and a 5-min reequilibration step with 20% buffer A. Structure Elucidation by NMR, VCD, and IR Measurements The exact mass was analyzed on a MAT 95XL-mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). 1H (600 MHz), 13C (150 MHz), and 2D NMR (HSQC, HMBC, 1H-1H COSY) spectra were carried out on a Varian NMR-S600. Chemical shifts are expressed in δ values (ppm), using the correspondent solvent as internal reference (CDCl3: δH = 7.25, δC = 77.0 ppm at T = 25°C or DMSO-d6: δH = 2.50, δC = 39.5 ppm at T = 35°C). Infrared measurements were carried out on a BRUKER Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a BRUKER PMA 50 VCD module (Bruker Optik GmbH, Ettlingen). A 100 mM foxicin A solution was prepared in anhydrous CDCl3 and placed in a BaF2 cell with a path length of 110 μm. Experimental spectra (4 cm-1 resolution) represent the average of a 6 h measurement in a rotating cell. IR spectra were corrected by subtraction of the solvent spectrum. VCD spectra were background corrected by solvent subtraction and smoothed by Fourier filtering (8 cm-1 resolution). The aperture of the light source was adjusted to a width of 4 mm. Opus 7.0 software (Bruker Corporation) was used to analyze the spectra. Conformer Search and Quantum Chemical Calculations The conformer search was carried out at the MMFF level using Spartan 08 (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) and gave a set of 84 possible conformers. The five conformers with the highest population (according to Boltzmann weights calculated in respect to relative energies) account for >99% of the calculated Boltzmann distribution. These conformers were chosen for quantum chemical calculations at the DFT level [B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)] in Gaussian 09, Revision D.01 (Frisch et al., 2013). All calculations were performed in gas phase, vibrational frequencies were uniformly scaled by an empirical factor of 0.975. Theoretical spectra for each geometry were obtained by adding Lorentzian band shapes (width 6 cm-1) to the calculated IR and VCD intensities. The dissymmetry factor spectrum defined as VCD over IR absorbance was obtained with CDSpecTech (Covington and Polavarapu, 2013, 2014). Single Crossover of foxBII in S. diastatochromogenes ΔpokOIV To construct a single crossover of foxBII gene (PKS I/NRPS hybrid gene) an internal 2 kb fragment was amplified (primers GCCGGGAAGCTTGTCCTCTTCGCCTC and GTCGTCGGATCCTGCGC CGCCTCGG). The fragment was cloned into pKC1132 (Bierman et al., 1992) at HindIII/BamHI cloning site and transferred into Escherichia coli ET12567 (dam-, dcm-, hsdS-, cmr) (MacNeil et al., 1992), including conjugation plasmid pUZ8002 (Flett et al., 1997). Positive transformants were selected on LB agar supplemented with kanamycin (30 μg mL-1) and apramycin (50 μg mL-1). The plasmid was transferred into S. diastatochromogenes ΔpokOIV by conjugation. Exconjugants were incubated on MS media supplemented with apramycin. Bioinformatic Analysis of Foxicin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster and Identification of Similar Biosynthetic Gene Cluster The draft genome of S. diastatochromogenes Tü6028 was sequenced at the Centrum of Biotechnology, University of Bielefeld (Greule et al., unpublished). Prediction of the gene clusters was performed using antiSMASH 3.01 (Weber et al., 2015a). The sequence of foxicin 57.6 kb hybrid PKS I/NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster was further analyzed and annotated using BLAST2. Similar gene clusters were identified by antiSMASH and BLAST analysis in other Streptomyces strains. The genomes of these strains were analyzed individually by the above mentioned programs. Phylogenetic Tree of fox Homologous Clusters A phylogenetic tree was calculated by Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011) using Neighbor-Joining method of foxBII sequence comparison. For better illustration, the tree is shown without distance correction. Siderophore Chrome Azurol S (CAS) – Assay Chrome azurol S medium was modified after Schwyn and Neilands (1987). For the CAS medium 60.5 mg CAS, 72.9 mg hexadecyltrimetyl ammonium bromide, and 30.24 g piperazine-1,4-bis-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) were dissolved in 990 mL water and mixed with 10 mL iron (III) solution (1 mM FeCl3 × 6H2O and 10 mM HCl). Purified foxicin A was pipetted to CAS reagent and a color change of the dark blue solution to violet was noted. Shift of UV/vis Spectra in the Presence of Iron Foxicin A was dissolved in MeOH. FeCl3 and FeSO4 were added in an amount of 0.5 mM to 100 mM. UV/vis spectra were measured by UviLine 9400 spectrophotometer (SI Analytics). Isolation of Bacterial Plasma Membranes Escherichia coli BW25113 cells were grown aerobically (180 rpm) at 37°C in baffled flasks using LB-medium. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5700 × g, 10 min, 4°C, Rotor JLA 8.1000, Avanti J-26 XP, Beckman Coulter) in the late exponential phase yielding approximately 6.5 g cells/L. All further steps were carried out at 4°C. After centrifugation, 5 g of the cell pellet were resuspended in fourfold volume of buffer 1 (50 mM MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM PMSF supplemented with desoxyribonuclease I) and disrupted by passing twice through a French Pressure Cell Press (110 MPa, SLM-Aminco). Cell debris and non-disrupted cells were removed by centrifugation (9500 × g, 20 min, 4°C, Rotor A8.24, RC-5 Superspeed Refrigerated Centrifuge, Sorvall Instruments). The cytoplasmic membranes were obtained from the supernatant by centrifugation at 252000 × g (60 min, 4°C, Rotor 70.1Ti, L8-M Ultrafuge, Beckman). The sediment was suspended in an equal volume (1:1, w/v) of buffer 1 and was used directly or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Determination of NADH Oxidase Activity The NADH oxidase activity of cytoplasmic membranes was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (RE K1-1, Oxytec) at 30°C. To calibrate the electrode 2 mL 50 mM MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 were deoxygenized by adding sodium dithionite and the signal was set to 237 μM oxygen (Weiss, 1970). Each measurement was performed with 2 mL buffer containing 5 μL of the membrane suspension at 30°C. The reaction was started by adding 1.25 mM NADH. 50–500 μM foxicin A was added to the assay to test its inhibitory action on cell respiration. Agar Diffusion Assay Antimicrobial activity of foxicin A was determined by the agar plate diffusion method on a paper disk (6 mm diameter). 100 μg per disk of foxicin A were tested against Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 (Hütter, 1962), Actinokineospora bangkokensis (Intra et al., 2013), Saccharothrix espanaensis (Kong et al., 1998), Bacillus subtilis (Ehrenberg) COHN ATCC6051 (American Type Culture Collection, 18th Edition, 1992), E. coli XL1-Blue, Fusarium verticillioides DSM 62264, Candida parapsilosis DSM 5784, Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155. The compound was dissolved in methanol. After evaporation of the methanol, disks were fixed on the test-plates and incubated over night at 30 or 37°C. Polyketomycin, apramycin, and methanol were used as controls. The following media were used for the assay: LB-medium (tryptone 1%, yeast extract 0.5%, NaCl 0.5%) for E. coli and Bacillus, MS medium (soya flour 2%, mannitol 2%) for actinomycetes strains, BG11-medium (NaNO3 0,15%, K2HPO4 0.004%, MgSO4 × 7H2O 0.0075%, CaCl2 × 2H2O 0.0036%, citric acid 0.0006%, ammonium ferric citrate 0.0006%, EDTA 0.0001%, Na2CO3 0.002%, trace elements 1.0 mL) for cyanobacterial strains, PDA-medium (potato extract 0,4%, dextrose 2%) for Fusarium, YPD-medium (yeast extract 1%, peptone 2%, glucose 2%) for Candida and Middlebrook 7H9 Broth (7H9 broth base 0.52%, 40% glycerol 5.5 mL) for Mycobacterium. For agar plates 2% agar-agar was added to the media. To assay the herbicidal property, 0.1, 1, and 5 μM of foxicin A was added to 6 mg of Arabidopsis thaliana wt ecotype Wassilewskija seeds that were plated onto plates. The plants were grown for 2 weeks in a phytochamber with long-day conditions (16/8 h), 100 μE m-2 s-1 light intensity and 25°C constant temperature. To check for H2O2 sensitivity, 2, 5, and 10 μL of 5% H2O2 solution were pipetted on paper disks (6 mm diameter) and placed on MS and TSB culture plates of S. diastatochromogenes WT, ΔpokOIV mutant and ΔpokOIV/foxBII::pKC1132 mutant. The strains were incubated at 28°C for 5 days and inhibition zone was measured. Cell Viability Assay (MTT-Assay) The effect on cell viability of foxicin A was tested against cancer cell lines CCRF-CEM, CEM-ADR5000 and Jurkat cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the MTT assay as previously described (Calderón et al., 2014). In brief, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well and incubated for 24 h with various concentrations of foxicin A. The chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin was used as a positive control, and DMSO (0.1%) was the solvent control. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
