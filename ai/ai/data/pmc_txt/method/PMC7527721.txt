MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, media, and growth conditions. B. cereus, B. subtilis, and E. coli strains were routinely cultivated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar or in LB broth unless stated otherwise at 30°C (B. cereus) or at 37°C (B. subtilis and E. coli). Where required, the appropriate antibiotics were added (120 μg/ml of ampicillin, 100 μg/ml of spectinomycin, 50 μg/ml of kanamycin, 10 μg/ml of erythromycin, 5 μg/ml of chloramphenicol) and incubated in 500-ml baffled flasks with rotary shaking at 150 rpm. All strains used are listed in Table 1. DNA manipulation and generation of the modified strains. An overview of plasmids used in this study is provided in Table S2. Oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized by Eurofins (Ebersberg, Germany) and are listed in Table S3. High-fidelity DNA polymerase (F-530XL; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) was used for cloning, restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs (MA) and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the Wizard SV gel and PCR cleanup system (A9282; Promega, WI) was used for DNA fragment purification, and T4 DNA ligase (EL0011; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for ligation. All inserts were proofed by DNA sequencing (LGC Genomics GmbH, Berlin, Germany). E. coli strains were transformed by heat shock, B. cereus by electroporation, and B. subtilis by natural competence transformation as previously described (3, 31, 58). Plasmids used in the study.

For deletion of the 33-aa region including the Walker A motif of cesC (for the amino acid sequence, see Fig. 5B), the pAD123 plasmid containing the PcesP-cesC-cesD sequence was used as a template. In the first step the upstream sequence of Walker A including the cesP promoter (PcesP) and the cesC sequence upstream of Walker A was amplified, while the downstream sequence of Walker A together with cesD and the terminator was amplified in the second PCR. Both PCR products were fused using DJ PCR and cloned into the E. coli/B. subtilis shuttle plasmid pAD123 (59). The new plasmid was designated pAD123cesCΔWalkerA. In a similar manner, K40M and V29T/F30Y mutations were inserted by PCR in the reversed primers of the upstream sequences as well as the forward primers of the downstream sequences. As described above, the fragments were joined using DJ PCR and cloned into the pAD123 plasmid, resulting in pAD123cesCK40M and pAD123cesCV29T/F30Y, respectively. Subsequently, plasmids were introduced into B. cereus by electroporation and the new strains were designated F48ΔcesCDcesCDΔWalkerA, F48ΔcesCDcesCD_K40M, and F48ΔcesCDcesCD_V29T/F30Y. Heterologous expression of BerA in F48ΔcesCD. To generate a berAB overexpression strain, the promoterless berAB gene (GenBank accession no. CP003889.1; 3579694 to 3581386) was amplified from the B. thuringiensis 407 strain and cloned into the pWH1520 E. coli/B. cereus shuttle vector carrying a xylose-inducible promoter (60). The plasmid pWH1520berAB(Bt) was introduced into B. cereus F48ΔcesCD by electroporation using tetracycline selection, resulting in F48ΔcesCDberAB. Overexpression of BerAB was induced by the addition of 0.1% d-xylose to LB cultures containing 103 CFU/ml of F48ΔcesCDberAB. Bacterial two-hybrid system and β-galactosidase assay. cesC (NCBI accession no. ABK00528.1), cesD (ABK00530.1), and selected domains of cesA (YP_001967170.1) and cesB (ACJ82785.1) were amplified from the emetic reference strain B. cereus F4810/72 (3) and cloned into pKT25, pKNT25, pUT18, and pUTC18C BACTH expression vectors (catalog no. EUK001; Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France). The respective plasmids were introduced into the E. coli BTH101 cya-deficient host strain by heat shock transformation. The procedure is based on functional complementation of two subunits of the adenylate cyclase (T18 and T25) fused with the tested interacting partners as previously described (32, 61). For each putative interaction, several combinations were tested as follows: every protein was tagged on the N and C termini as well as by both subunits of adenylate cyclase (T18 and T25; for a detailed description of the cloned domains, the reader is referred to Table S1). Respective combinations were cotransformed in E. coli BTH101 cells and plated on LB X-Gal/IPTG agar or LB IPTG for β-galactosidase assay. The cells were incubated for 24 h at 30°C. Thereafter, the cells were moved to room temperature (RT) for 20 h, transferred to 18°C, and incubated for 20 h. For the β-galactosidase assay, the cells were harvested from the LB-IPTG plates and resuspended in 1 ml of Z buffer (10 mM KCl, 100 mM MgSO4, 0.27% β-mercaptoethanol, sodium phosphate buffer [pH 7.0]). Optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was adjusted to 0.4 to 0.7, cells were permeabilized using β-mercaptoethanol, SDS, and chloroform, and the enzymatic reaction (at 28°C) was induced by addition of 4 mg/ml of o-nitrophenol-β-galactoside (ONPG) in sodium phosphate buffer. The time at which each sample turned yellow was recorded, and the reaction was stopped with 1 M Na2CO3. OD420 and OD550 values were measured using a BioSpectrometer basic (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The β-galactosidase activity was determined according to the method of Miller (61) and expressed in Miller units [MU]. The mean values of β-galactosidase activity from each experiment were normalized by the mean value of the respective negative control (BTH101 cells coexpressing only T18 and T25 subunits of adenylate cyclase). Thus, the indicated positive interactions are expressed as fold change compared to the respective negative control. Pulldown assay. CesC was C-terminally labeled with S tag, while C* domains of CesA were tagged on the C terminus with 6×His tag. Thus, the cesC gene and the C* domain of cesA were amplified and cloned directly into the pET Duet expression vector in frame with the S and 6×His tags, respectively. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 or Tuner. Due to problems with solubility and stability of the recombinant proteins, two different expression strains of E. coli were used. CesC-S tag was expressed in the E. coli Tuner strain, while BL21 cells were used for expression of CesA_C*-6×His. Cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.3, induced with 0.125 mM IPTG at 18°C overnight, and harvested by centrifugation (20 min and 5,000 rpm). The bacterial pellet from a 100-ml culture of CesA_C*_6×His tag cells (BL21) was resuspended in 2 ml of high-salt solubilization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM AEBSF, a protease inhibitor including aprotinin, bestatin, E64, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA), and the bacterial pellet from a 50-ml culture of CesC-S tag cells (Tuner) was resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. The suspensions were pooled and the mixture was lysed by sonication (15.000 kHz, 25 times for 9 s with a 1-min break and constant cooling), followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 rpm. The supernatant was used for the pulldown assay and thus applied onto a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). The column was washed 9 times with sonication buffer supplemented with 40 mM imidazole, and the captured proteins were eluted with 1 M imidazole. One-milliliter fractions of the column efflux were collected. A total of 100 μl of each fraction was boiled with the equal amount of 2× sample Laemmli buffer, followed by loading of 20 μl of each sample onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were labeled with 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (Sigma, MO) and visualized in a 300-nm UV transilluminator (51). Subsequently, proteins were analyzed by multiplex Western blotting using the Penta-His horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for detection of CesA_C*_6×His tag by chemiluminescence as well as an S tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and the StarBright Blue 700 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, CA) for detection of CesC-S tag by fluorescence. Protein sizes were determined using a prestained protein marker detected by colorimetry. Signals from the different channels were recorded simultaneously using a multichannel ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad, CA). To test the unspecific binding of CesC-S tag to the HisTrap HP column, bacterial pellets from a 50-ml culture of CesC-S tag cells (Tuner) were resuspended in 1 ml of high-salt solubilization buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged, and the soluble fraction was loaded onto the column and treated as described above. Colocalization experiments. The promoter of cesP and the C* domain of cesA were amplified from the reference B. cereus strain F4810/72, while mNeon Green (mNG) was amplified from pET14b_mNeonGreen (a plasmid kindly provided by M. Leake, University of York, UK). All three PCR fragments were merged in DJ PCR with mNG adjusted to the C terminus (36). The fragment containing PcesP-cesA_C*-mNG-T7terminator was cloned into the pDG1664 B. subtilis suicide vector in the region flanked by thrC upstream and downstream complementary sequences and comprising the Ermr cassette. Similarly, PcesP, cesC, and cesD were amplified from the reference B. cereus strain F4810/72, while mScarlet was amplified from pET14b_mScarlet. All PCR products were joined in three-step DJ PCR. The fragment containing PcesP-cesC-mScarletstop-cesD-T7terminator was cloned in the region flanked by amyE upstream and downstream complementary sequences as well as comprising the Sprr cassette in the pKAM241 B. subtilis suicide vector (62). Both suicide plasmids pDG1664 PcesP-cesA_C*-mNG-T7terminator and pKAM241 PcesP-cesC-mScarletstop-cesD-T7terminator were transformed in B. subtilis 168 by natural competence transformation. The new strain was designated Bs_cesCD/cesA_C*. The control strains Bs_cesC/cesA_C* and Bs_cesD/cesA_C* were constructed in the same way. For detailed descriptions of the genotypes and the plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study, the reader is referred to Table 1 and Tables S2 and S3. Liquid cultures of B. subtilis
Bs_cesC-mSc_D/cesA_C*-mNG, Bs_cesC-mSc/cesA_C*-mNG, and Bs_cesD/cesA_C*-mNG strains containing the fusions of B. cereus
cesP promoter and selected genes or domains of the cereulide operon with mNeon Green (excitation, 504 nm, and emission, 517 nm) and mScarlet (excitation, 570 nm, and emission, 593 nm) were grown overnight in LB medium at 37°C. The strains were spotted on MYP agar (mannitol-egg yolk-polymyxin) and incubated for 20 h at 30°C. Bacterial colonies were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min at 5,000 rpm. The cells were resuspended in PBS, applied to poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and analyzed using an Olympus BX63 fluorescence microscope, with cubes U-FBWA for detection of mNeon Green and U-FYW for detection of mScarlet. The microscope was equipped with an Andor Zyla 5.5 sCMOS camera. Olympus CellP imaging software and ImageJ (63) were used for image acquisition and analysis, respectively. Cereulide quantification by HPLC-MS/MS. For quantification of cereulide, 100 ml of LB medium was inoculated with 103 CFU/ml of B. cereus with the appropriate antibiotics in baffled flasks and cells were grown for 24 h at 30°C and 150 rpm. Cereulide was extracted as described previously (30). In brief, bacteria were pelletized by centrifugation (8,000 × g, 23°C, and 10 min), and 50 mg of bacterial biomass was resuspended in 1 ml of acetonitrile (99%, high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] grade; Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), followed by incubation for 16 h at RT on a rocking table. Samples were centrifuged, and supernatants were put through Phenex HPLC syringe filters (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and directly transferred to the HPLC vials. Cereulide concentrations were determined using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based multianalyte method (64). In brief, a QTrap 5500 LC-MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a Turbo Ion Spray electrospray ionization (ESI) source was coupled to a 1290 series HPLC System (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Chromatographic separation was performed at 25°C using a Gemini C18 column, 150 mm by 4.6-mm inside diameter [i.d.], 5-μm particle size, guarded with a C18 4 mm by 3-mm-i.d. security guard cartridge (Phenomenex). Two methanol/water/acetic acid preparations (10:89:1 and 97:2:1 [vol/vol/vol]), both of which contained 5 mM ammonium acetate, were used as eluents A and B. An injection volume of 5 μl and flow rate of 1 ml/min were used. Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences between mean values (α = 0.05) was tested by applying unpaired two-sample Student’s t tests (assuming equal variances) using the software GraphPad Prism 8 (v8.3.0; GraphPad Software, Inc.). Error bars in figures represent standard deviation from the mean value. Protein similarity search. A BLASTP search of bacterial reference genomes in NCBI using the CesCD amino acid sequence from the emetic reference strain F4810/72 (AH187) (3) was performed in order to identify CesCD homologs. Since the results from in vitro and in vivo interaction studies revealed that the ATPase CesC of the putative ABC transporter CesCD interacts with NRPS CesAB, the MIBiG Database was employed to search for CesC-homologous ABC proteins encoded in other NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters. The Ces cluster nucleotide sequence was therefore submitted to the antiSMASH database (65) and the retrieved CesC protein sequence was subsequently used to search the MIBiG database (38) for NRPS clusters comprising ABC transporters related to CesC. The cutoff for sequence identity between CesC and homologous proteins in NRPS clusters was set to 32%.
