Materials and methods High-throughput screening for toxoflavin-degrading activity from metagenomic DNA library The metagenome libraries used to screen toxoflavin-degrading activity were from Korea National Research Resource Bank (http://www.knrrc.or.kr/). The glycerol stock of metagenomic E. coli pools were stored at -70°C in a deep freezer. Each E. coli pool was thawed and inoculated into 800 μL of Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with toxoflavin (20 μg/mL) and antibiotics depending on types of plasmids and fosmids (34 μg chloramphenicol/mL, 50 μg ampicillin/mL and 10 μg tetracycline/mL) in deep-well plates. The deep-well plates were placed in a microplate incubator (Heidoph, Germany) and cultured at 37°C for 44 h in a shaking incubator. After 20 and 40 h cultivation, 100 μL of the cultures were transferred into 96 well plates to measure optical density (OD) at 600 nm. After the initial screening, metagenomic pools which displayed OD values over than 0.2 were spread on LB agar plates to separate the positive metagenomic pool into individual E. coli colonies. Each of clones were inoculated again into 800 μL of LB medium supplemented with toxoflavin (20 μg/mL) and ampicillin (50 μg/mL). To avoid the isolation of false-positive clones, several clones showing growth at 20 μg/mL of toxoflavin were successively transferred to fresh LB medium containing 20, 30, and 40 μg/mL of toxoflavin and further incubated for each 2 day. Finally, several E. coli clones carrying toxoflavin-degrading activity in the presence of toxoflavin were identified by measuring OD values and subjected for further genetic analysis. Genetic analysis The toxoflavin-degrading clones were cultivated in LB medium for isolation of plasmid DNA using QIAGEN Plasmid Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). The sequences of inserted DNA were determined with universal sequencing primer M13F (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) and M13R (5′-GCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3′) using the automatic DNA analyzer (Applied biosystem, USA) at the Macrogen sequencing service (Macrogen, Daejeon, Korea). The obtained sequences were retrieved for sequence comparisons from protein and nucleotide database on the NCBI server and ORF finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/). Sequence similarity searches were performed with the BLASTX program and then homologous sequences were aligned with ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) and MegAlign program (DNAstar, USA). Based on the sequencing results, a toxoflavin-degrading fosmid was selected and named as M2-67-B11. A restriction enzyme map of M2-67-B11 fosmid was constructed by digestion of middle and end of each putative open reading frame (ORF) with restriction enzymes, SbfI, SacI, PstI, and AvaI. To find the ORF responsible for toxoflavin degradation, each DNA fragment was ligated into pUC19 vector (NEB, England) and then the recombinant plasmids were introduced into E.coli XL1-Blue cell (RBC, Taiwan). Each transformant was cultured in LB medium containing toxoflavin of 30 μg/mL and measured the optical density at 600 nm. The plasmid containing ORF related toxoflavin-degrading activity was named as pUC-TxeA. In addition, the deduced amino acid sequences of the selected ORF, txeA, were analyzed. Expression and purification of toxoflavin-degrading enzyme The plasmid pUC-TxeA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with two primers (ToxF, 5′-aaaGGATCCatgaatcagcctcctcc-3′ and ToxR, 5′-aaaGGTACCgccgcgacgtacccaca-3′), which contained BamHI and KpnI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR mixtures contained 50 ng of the pUC-TxeA plasmid as the initial template, 250 ng of each primer, 200 μM of each dNTP, and 5 U of Taq DNA polymerase in Taq DNA polymerase reaction buffer. The PCR started with a denaturation step at 95°C for 30 sec, followed by 30 cycles of amplification (30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C), and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) were digested with BamHI and KpnI and ligated into pQE30 vector. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into E.coli JM109, and the transformant was grown in LB broth until the optical density reached to 0.6 at 600 nm. Induction was done by adding 0.5 mM of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) with shaking at 18°C. After 20 h, the cells were harvested using a centrifuge at 4000 rpm and 4°C for 30 min. The cell pellet was washed twice with distilled water and homogenized in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0, 50 mM) using an ultrasonicator (Sonics and Materials, USA) followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was applied onto the column for the 6X histidine tag-based affinity chromatography. The unbound proteins were removed by 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole. The protein bound to the column was then eluted by 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 300 mM NaCl with 250 mM imidazole. The eluted sample was dialyzed in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and kept at 4°C. Enzymatic properties of toxoflavin-degrading enzyme Enzymatic properties of the purified TxeA, such as the optimum pH and temperature, and metal ion preferences, was investigated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin layer chromatography (TLC)-based methods. Unless otherwise notes, all reactions were performed under 180 rpm and 25°C for 60 min in 800 μL of reaction mixture containing 500 μL of sodium citrate buffer (20 mM, pH 5), 100 μL of dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 μL of MnCl2 (0.1M), 50 μL of enzyme stock solution (0.4 mg/ml) and 50 μL of toxoflavin (0.64 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction was quenched by addition of 800 μL of 10 M urea followed by filtration through a pall protein concentrator (10,000 kDa cut off) at 7,500 rpm and 30°C for 15 min. To determine the enzymatic thermostability, the residual activity was measured after TxeA was preincubated at different temperatures (15–50°C) for 60 min. The effect of pH on catalytic activity was examined in either 20 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.0–5.5), or 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–8.0). Toxoflavin remaining in the reaction solution was analyzed by HPLC as described below. The effect of metal ions on toxoflavin-degrading activity was tested with 100 mM of metal ions including MnCl2, FeCl2, CuCl2, CoCl2, CaCl2, and MgCl2. Analytical methods The concentration of residual toxoflavin and the enzymatic product in reaction solutions were analyzed using HPLC (Waters 996 PDA HPLC system; Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a diode array detector. Briefly, a 150 mm × 4.6 mm Phenomenex Luna C18 column (particle size of 5 μm) was used to separate the toxoflavin at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The solvents constituting the mobile phase were 100% water (solvent A, containing 0.1% acetic acid) and 100% MeOH (solvent B, containing 0.1% acetic acid). The gradient program was as follows: 0–20 min, 10% B; 20–40 min, linear gradient solvent system from 10% B to 100% B; 40–43 min, 100% B. The retention time of toxoflavin was 6.1 min. Large-scale purification of degradation products of toxoflavin and its analogs A large-scale reaction was carried out with a total of 120 ml reaction mixture consisting of 85 mL sodium citrate buffer (20 mM, pH 5.0), 15 mL DTT (100 mM), 7.5 mL MnCl2 (100 mM), 7.5 mL toxoflavin (1.6 mg/mL) and 5 mL enzyme solution (0.5 mg/mL). The reaction mixture was incubated at 20°C for 1 h in a shaking incubator (200 rpm) and then filtrated with an ultrafiltration spin filter (molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa). The filtered reaction solution was applied onto C18 cartridge for solid phase extraction (Sep-Pak C18, Agilent Technology). The cartridge was rinsed successively with 150 mL water and 150 mL of 100% MeOH. The water fraction was again applied to the solid phase extraction process. The water fraction from the second extraction was freeze-dried to remove water and the residues were dissolved in 300 μL MeOH. The enzymatic product was purified by preparative TLC (Silica Gel 60 F254 plates, Merck) using solvent system of chloroform and methanol (8:2, v/v). To identify the products, TLC was performed in a chamber containing mixed solvents of chloroform and methanol (8:2, v/v) at room temperature. Determination of final products The chemical structures of the final degradation products of toxoflavin and its analogs were determined mainly by mass spectrometry (MS), proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR) analyses. Electrospray ionization-mass spectra (ESI-MS) of final products were recorded on a single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI (MSD1100, Hewlett-Packard Co., CA). The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded in CD3OD (Merck) on a Bruker AMX-500 (500 MHz) spectrometer (Bruker Analytische Messtechnik GmbH, Germany) at 500 MHz for 1H-NMR spectra and 125 MHz for 13C-NMR spectra. The spectra were referenced to either tetramethylsilane (TMS) or solvent signals.
