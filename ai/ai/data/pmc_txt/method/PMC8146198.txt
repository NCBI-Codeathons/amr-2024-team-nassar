4. Methods 4.1. Fungal Strains and Chemical Reagents R. lauricola (CBS 127349, Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was kindly provided by R. Ploetz (UF-TREC, Homestead, FL, USA). The fungus was cultured on potato dextrose agar/broth (PDA/PDB) and Czapek-dox agar/broth (CZA/CZB) amended as indicated. Conidial suspensions were prepared by harvesting conidia from PDA plates after 7 d growth by flooding plates with 1–2 mL of sterile 0.05% Tween-20 solution. Cell suspensions were adjusted to desired concentrations after counting using a hemocytometer. Lipi-Red, Lipi-Green, and Lipi-Blue were obtained from Dojindo Molecular Technologies (Rockville, MD, USA). Nile Red, BODIPY, and fatty acids (decanoic, lauric, myristic, palmitic, and oleic acids) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 4.2. Phenotype Microarrays The Biolog phenotype microarray plate series (PM1, PM2A, PM3B, PM4A, PM5, PM6, PM7, PM8, PM9, PM10, PM21D, PM22D, PM23A, PM24C, PM25D, Biolog, Hayward, CA, USA) were inoculated according to the Biolog PM Procedures for Filamentous Fungi with slight modifications. Briefly, R. lauricola blastospores were harvested from a 3 d PDB cultures by filtration through sterile lens paper, followed by washing with sterile distilled water. Cells were washed once with sterile Filamentous Fungi-Inoculating Fluid (FF-IF, Biolog, catalogue # 72106) and finally resuspension in sterile FF-IF. The spore suspension was then used to inoculate 12 mL of sterile FF-IF to an OD650 = 0.1. This solution was then added to each of four inoculating fluid stock solutions (PM1.2, PM3,5–8, PM4, and PM9+). FF-IF was utilized for PM plates 1 and 2. FF-IF plus 100 mmol/L d-glucose, 5 mmol/L potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), and 2 mmol/L sodium sulfate was used for plates PM3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. FF-IF plus 100 mmol/L d-glucose was used for plate PM4. FF-IF plus yeast nitrogen base and 100 mmol/L d-glucose was used for plates PM9 and 10, and PM21–25. 100 μL of each inoculating fluid stock solution was then added to each of the wells in their respective plates, and wells were covered with sealing tape. Plates were incubated at 26 °C for 4 d, after which the endpoint OD750 was read for each well using a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro microplate reader. Each plate was run in duplicate, and endpoint OD750 readings for corresponding conditions were averaged across all data points and used to generate heatmaps of fungal growth in each condition. For chemical sensitivity plates, each condition was represented in quadruplicate and all replicates were averaged (8 total per condition). For comparisons of growth, raw OD750 readings from substrates and negative control wells were compared directly. 4.3. Preparation of Lipid Droplet Dye Stocks and Working Solutions Concentrated stock solutions of the fluorescent dyes were made in DMSO for Lipi-Blue, Lipi-Green, and Lipi-Red (1 mM), acetone for Nile Red (10 mM), and in PBS for BODIPY (5 mM) and stored at −20 °C until use. Working solutions of dyes were made fresh on the day of their intended use by diluting stock solutions in PBS to the desired concentration as follows: 0.1–0.5 μM for Lipi-Blue and Lipi-Green, 1–5 μM for Lipi-Red. 10 μM for Nile Red, and 1–5 μM for BODIPY. All dye solutions were maintained in the dark for a much as possible. 4.4. Fatty Acid Utilization and Lipid Droplet Staining Fungal growth on PDA, and PDA plates supplemented with 0.05% of either decanoic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, or oleic acid (initially dissolved in hexane and added to the cooling media before pouring into Petri plates), were inoculated in the center of the plate with 5 μL of 5 × 108 conidia/mL solution of R. lauricola cell suspension. Plates were incubated at 25 °C and growing colonies were photographed every 3 d over a 15 d growth period. Colony diameters were measured using the ImageJ software. Triplicate plates were examined for each condition, and the entire experiment replicated three times. Fungal growth and lipid assimilation were monitored in liquid cultures over time by inoculating 50 mL PDB or PDB supplemented with 0.05% lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, or oleic acid originally dissolved in 500 μL hexane) with 500 μL of 5 × 108 spores/mL solution of Raffaelea lauricola conidia harvested from 7 d old PDA plates. Liquid cultures were grown at 25 °C with aeration (200 rpm orbital shaking) and cell suspension aliquots (5 mL) were collected for analysis at 12, 16, 20, and 24-h post-inoculation time points. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4300 rpm for 5 min), and the fungal cells were washed 2× with PBS before being resuspended in 1 mL of the appropriate lipid dye working solution. Cells were then incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 h, then washed 3× with PBS for microscopic visualization. A 500 μL aliquot of a 5 × 108 spore solution (harvested from PDA plates) was also taken and processed directly as above with the appropriate lipid dye to generate a 0-h time point for growth. Preliminary quantification of BODIPY and Nile Red fluorescence was performed using the image analysis software imageJ (Supplemental Figure S5). Images were converted to 16-bit grey scale and the “freehand” tool was used to trace the outlines of individual fungal cells. The “analyze” tool, with “area integrated density” and “mean grey scale value” selected for “set measurement” parameters, was used to measure the selected area. Background readings were taken for normalizing fluorescence measurements to obtain a value for corrected total cell fluorescence. This process was performed for 120–160 cells per group in order to compare fluorescence between uninduced (PDB) and induced (PDB + Oleic acid) conditions. 4.5. Confocal Microscopy Sample slides were imaged using a Zeiss lsm800 confocal microscope at 63× oil immersion with a differential interference contrast (DIC) filter with eight points of averaging and data collected using the Zen software. Filters used included: BODIPY; BodFl (Ex/Em 205/511), Nile Red; nilRe (Ex/Em 559/636), Lipi-Red; LTReN (Ex/Em 582/616), Lipi-Green; LTGrN (Ex/Em 498/507), Lipi-Blue; PacBl (Ex/Em 402/455). Bright-field images were also collected for all samples, and z-stacks of roughly 10–20 slices were recorded in order to capture fluorescence signals along hyphal strands spanning multiple planes of focus. Subsequent z-stacks were assembled into maximum intensity projections for figure images.
