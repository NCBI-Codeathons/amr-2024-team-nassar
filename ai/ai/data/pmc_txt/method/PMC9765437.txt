MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of plasmids for protein expression. Plasmids for the expression of clp, clgR, and popR genes of S. hawaiiensis NRRL 15010 were obtained by ligating PCR-amplified gene sequences with linearized pET11a or pET22b vectors (Merck-Novagen), respectively. All bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material (see also references 72–77), including a detailed description of templates and restriction enzymes used. As PCR template, genomic DNA of S. hawaiiensis NRRL 15010 (NCBI GenBank accession number CP021978.1) was used to amplify shclpP1 (orf CEB94_14110), shclpP2 (orf CEB94_14105), shClpX (orf CEB94_14100), shclpC1 (orf CEB94_23085), shclpC2 (orf CEB94_33910), shclgR (orf CEB94_30145), and shpopR (MT943519). Since clpP2 encodes an internal XhoI restriction site, the vector pET22b*NcoI was created, in which the XhoI restriction site was exchanged for an NcoI restriction site (19). In addition, both shclpP1 and shclpP2 genes were cloned into the pETDUET-1 vector (Merck-Novagen), yielding the plasmid pETDUETshclpP1ATG2clpP2-His, in which the simultaneous expression of the clp genes is regulated by two distinct T7 promoters. Additionally, side-directed mutagenesis was performed, yielding the constructs pET22bshclpP1S113A, pET22bshclpP2S131A, pET11ashclpP1hp, pET11ashclpP1Y76S, pET22bshclpP2hp, and pET22bshclpP2S94Y. Therefore, primers were designed according to the protocol of the QuikChange II Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) and as listed in Table S2. To verify the correct nucleotide sequence of the respective gene, Sanger sequencing was performed by LGC Genomics, Germany. Of note, both ClpP1 and ClpP2 were used as unprocessed proteins in all assays unless mentioned otherwise. However, during sequence analysis of ClpP2, a second putative start codon was detected, which would give rise to a shortened protein (ClpP2ATG2). To ensure that ClpP2ATG2 would behave similarly compared to full-length ClpP2, we also cloned and purified ClpP2ATG2, determined its processing site, and performed degradation experiments using ClpP2 and ClpP2ATG2 side by side. Here, no differences were observed for ClpP2ATG2 compared to using ClpP2 (Fig. S7). Of note, due to solubility issues, ClpP2 proteins with mutations in the hydrophobic pocket (i.e., ClpP2hp, ClpP2S94Y) were produced from ATG2 and were then compared to ClpP2ATG2 in respective assays (Fig. 2B to D; Fig. 3B and 3F; Fig. 5A to D; Fig. S2H, S3A, and S7). Intact protein mass spectrometry and processing analysis of Clp2ATG2, as well as peptidase/protease activities of Clp2ATG1 versus Clp2ATG2 and hydrophobic pocket mutants. (A and B) Intact protein mass spectrometry of ClpP2ATG2 (A) and ClpP1 + ClpP2ATG2 (B). In principle, ClpP2 may also be expressed from a putative second start codon (here indicated by ClpP2ATG2). We therefore cloned and expressed ClpP2ATG2 using the putative second start codon and tested its processing behavior using intact protein mass spectrometry compared to ClpP2. Our data show that the putative second start codon of ClpP2 results in the same processed mature protein compared to expression from the first start codon, as it is shown in Fig. S4. (C) Amino acid sequence of full-length ClpP2 highlighting the first and putative second start codon (gray dots) as well as the resulting processing site deduced from intact protein mass spectrometry. The detected mass for processed ClpP2ATG2* indicates the same processing site between the amino acids S33 and R34, resulting in a protein that starts with RYIIPR, similar to processed ClpP2*. (D) Suc-LY-AMC (left) and FITC-casein (right) degradation assays showing peptidase and protease activity, respectively, of ClpP2ATG1 compared to ClpP2ATG2. Clp wild-type and mutant proteins as well as ADEP1 were used as indicated. The data corroborates our results shown above regarding the role of ClpP1 in ADEP-mediated proteolysis as well as of ClpP2 for Clp-ATPase binding. In all assays, hydrolysis of Suc-LY-AMC and FITC-casein was recorded as an RFU increase over time. Mean values (normalized to %) of initial linear reaction kinetics are shown. Statistical analyses were performed with one-way ANOVA using three biological replicates each comprising three technical replicates, with the exception that two biological replicates were used in Suc-LY-AMC degradation assays employing the hydrophobic pocket mutants ClpP1hp and ClpP2hp. ns, P > 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ****, P ≤ 0.0001. Error bars indicate standard deviations. (E and F) In vitro β-casein, ClgR, or PopR degradation assays employing purified Clp proteins and ADEP1/DMSO as indicated. Corroborating our results above, the use of either ClpP2ATG1 or ClpP2ATG2 resulted in comparable activities in these assays. Further noteworthy, accelerated substrate degradation in the presence of ADEP1 also occurred in samples using ClpP2ATG2. All assays were performed at least in triplicates and representative SDS-PAGE images are shown. DMSO was used in control reactions. Download FIG S7, PDF file, 1.3 MB. Bacterial strains and plasmids.

For the expression and purification of Clp proteins and the substrates ClgR and PopR, the respective expression plasmids were transformed into the ΔclpP deletion strain E. coli SG1146a (78). The resulting expression strains were then used to inoculate expression cultures using lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/mL). Cultures were grown at 37°C with constant shaking until a mid-log exponential growth phase (OD600 of 0.5 to 0.6) was reached and then protein expression was induced with 0.5 to 1 mM IPTG. Expression cultures for ClpP1, the ClpATPases, and PopR were further incubated for 4 to 5 h at 30°C with constant shaking, whereas ClpP2 and ClgR expression was carried out for 16 h at 30°C and 20°C, respectively. Then, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The following purification procedure was performed at 4°C. For cell disruption, glass beads were utilized (150 to 212 μm) in a Precellys homogenizer (Precellys evolution, Bertin technologies). Cell lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were passed through 0.45-μm membrane filters (Sarstedt) to remove cell debris before further processing. For purification of untagged ClpP1 and ClpP2, the respective supernatants were applied to 1/5 mL HiTrap Q XL columns (GE Healthcare) for anion-exchange chromatography using the ÄKTA Start chromatography system (GE Healthcare) with buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 8) and buffer B (50 mM Tris and 1 M NaCl, pH 8). For purification of His6-tagged proteins, 500 to 700 μL Ni-NTA resin (Thermo-Fisher) was added to the supernatant and the suspension was incubated for at least 2 h at 4°C. Affinity chromatography was performed using lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.7), wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.7), and elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.7). Protein fractions were pooled for buffer exchange employing a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and centrifugal filters (Amicon Ultracel-10 K/30 K; Merck). Protein concentration and purity were determined via SDS-PAGE analysis, Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, applying BSA as reference), and immunoblotting. Here, polyclonal rabbit anti-ClpP1 and rabbit anti-ClpP3 antibodies (provided by Philippe Mazodier) were used, which have been previously described (22–24, 36). For 6×-His-tag detection, monoclonal mouse anti-6×-His antibodies (Epitope-tag-clone HIS.H8; Thermo Fisher) were employed. Accordingly, IgG (H+L) rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Invitrogen) or IgG (H+L) goat anti-rabbit HRP (Pierce) was used as secondary antibodies. Size exclusion chromatography. To study the oligomeric behavior of native ClpP1 and native ClpP2, analytical gel filtration was performed using the Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). To this end, 80 μM of each protein was incubated with or without the addition of 200 μM ADEP1 for 30 min at 30°C. As a control, DMSO was used instead of ADEP1. Additionally, ClpP1P2His (90 μM each) was incubated with 200 μM ADEP1 for 2 h at 30°C and applied to the gel filtration column. For gel filtration, buffer GF was used (50 mM HEPES-KOH, 150 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5). The protein markers thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), conalbumin (75 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa) were employed for size estimation. Thermal shift assays. To determine the binding affinity of ADEP1 to native ClpP1 and native ClpP2, thermal shift assays were performed. Therefore, 30 μM of each protein in GF buffer was incubated with or without the addition of 75 μM ADEP1 for 30 min at 30°C, before adding 1× SYPRO orange (Merck). DMSO was used as a control. Here, the following method was used on a QuantStudio 3 (Fisher Scientific) RT-PCR cycler: 20°C for 3 min, 20°C to 90°C with an increase of 0.05°C sec−1. Baseline correction, Boltzmann sigmoid curve fitting, and fast Fourier transform curve smoothening were performed using the OriginLab software. Four replicates were analyzed. P values were calculated with one-way ANOVA (not significant [ns], P > 0.05; *, P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001; ****, P ≤ 0.0001). In vitro peptidase assays. Peptidase assays were carried out in a total volume of 100 μL at 30°C in activity buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, 150 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). Peptidase activity of ClpP1 and ClpP2His was measured using 100 μM fluorogenic N-succinyl-Leu-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-LY-AMC), 100 μM benzyloxycarbonyl-glycyl-glycyl-l-leucine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Z-GGL-AMC), 100 μM acetyl-Trp-Leu-Ala-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-WLA-AMC), or 100 μM Ac-Ala-hArg-(S)-2-aminooctanoic acid-7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin (Ac-Ala-hArg-2-Aoc-ACC) as the substrates in the absence or presence of 10 μM ADEP1. A total ClpP protein concentration of 4 μM was employed for each sample, using equal amounts of ClpP1 and ClpP2 (2 μM each) in mixed samples. Furthermore, ClpP2 (4 μM) was tested at increased concentrations of ADEP1, i.e., 100 μM and 200 μM, while ADEP-sensitive ClpP1 (4 μM) plus 100 μM ADEP1 was used as a positive control. In all assays, DMSO served as a negative control. For the analysis of the hydrophobic pocket mutants ClpP1hp and ClpP2hp, a total ClpP protein concentration of 8 μM in the absence or presence of 30 μM ADEP1, ADEP2, or ADEP4 was used. ClpP and ADEP/DMSO were preincubated for 10 min at 30°C. The release of AMC (Suc-LY-AMC or Z-GGL-AMC) was monitored in black flat-bottom 96-well plates (Sarstedt) in a spectrofluorometer (TECAN Spark) at an excitation wavelength λex of 380 nm and an emission wavelength λem of 460 nm. Experiments using Ac-WLA-AMC or Ac-Ala-hArg-2-Aoc-ACC as the substrates were performed in black flat-bottom 96-well plates (Sarstedt) in a spectrofluorometer (TECAN Spark) at λex 430 nm/λem 351 nm for Ac-WLA-AMC and λex 380 nm/λem 430 nm for Ac-Ala-hArg-2-Aoc-ACC. At least three biological replicates were analyzed, each with three technical replicates, with an exception for testing ClpPhp mutants with two biological replicates. P-values were calculated with one-way ANOVA (ns, P > 0.05; *, P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001; ****, P ≤ 0.0001). In vitro casein degradation and ClpP processing assays. For the ClpC1-mediated degradation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-casein (FITC-casein; Sigma; catalog no. c3777), 4 μM ClpC1 and a total ClpP protein concentration of 8 μM (4 μM each in mixed samples) were resuspended in activity buffer. Proteins were preincubated for 10 min at 30°C before the reaction was started by adding 6 μM FITC-casein. Mixed samples of ClpP1P2His in the absence of ClpC1 were tested in control reactions. Reactions were performed in the absence or presence of 30 μM ADEP1 or an equal volume of DMSO as a control. Degradation of FITC-casein (6 μM) by ClpC2P1P2 or ClpXP1P2 (4 μM each) was conducted accordingly. The hydrolysis of FITC-casein was monitored in black 96-well plates (Sarstedt) in a spectrofluorometer (Tecan Spark) at λex 490 nm/λem 525 nm. At least with three biological replicates were analyzed, each comprising three technical replicates. Statistics were performed with one-way ANOVA (ns, P > 0.05; *, P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001; ****, P ≤ 0.0001). For the ClpC2-mediated degradation of β-casein, equal amounts of ClpP1, ClpP2His, and ClpC2 (1.5 μM each) and 10 μM β-casein were incubated in activity buffer for 4 h at 30°C. Reactions were performed in the absence or presence of 30 μM ADEP1 or equal volume of DMSO as a control. For in vitro ClpP processing assays, 2 μM either ClpP1 or ClpP2His or mixed samples consisting of both 2 μM ClpP1 and 2 μM ClpP2His were incubated at 30°C with 10 μM ADEP1 or DMSO in activity buffer. Samples were taken at indicated time points and were analyzed via SDS-PAGE. Experiments were performed at least in biological triplicates, and representative SDS-PAGE images are shown. In all assays for FITC-casein and β-casein degradation, an artificial ATP regeneration system (4 mM ATP, 8 mM creatine phosphate, and 10 U/mL creatine phosphokinase) was used in the reactions to sufficiently replenish ATP for Clp-ATPase activity. In vitro degradation of ClgR and PopR. For the ClpX-mediated degradation of ClgR and PopR (3 μM each), 3 μM ClpP1 and 3 μM ClpP2His (or 1.5 μM each in mixed samples) were used in combination with 1.5 μM ClpX in activity buffer plus 2 mM DTT. For the ClpC1- or ClpC2-mediated degradation of ClgR and PopR (3 μM each), 1.5 μM ClpP1 and 1.5 μM ClpP2His were used in combination with either ClpC1 or ClpC2 (each 1.5 μM). Reactions were performed in the absence or presence of 30 μM ADEP1 or an equal volume of DMSO as a control. Experiments were performed at least in biological triplicates, and representative SDS-PAGE images are shown. An artificial ATP regeneration system (4 mM ATP, 8 mM creatine phosphate, and 10 U/mL creatine phosphokinase) was used in the reactions to sufficiently replenish ATP for Clp-ATPase activity. Densitometry. The relative quantity of protein bands was calculated using Image Lab Software (Bio-Rad). As a reference, the protein bands collected at time point 0 h (t0) were utilized for each sample. The mean values of three biological replicates are shown. In vitro degradation of GFP-ssrA. For the ClpX-mediated degradation of C terminally ssrA-tagged GFP, 3 μM ClpP1, ClpP2His, and ClpX were used, mixed in activity buffer plus 2 mM DTT. Reactions were performed in the absence or presence of 30 μM ADEP1 or an equal volume of DMSO as a control. An artificial ATP regeneration system was added to the reactions as described above. All reaction components except for GFP-ssrA were preincubated for 10 min at 30°C. Then, reactions were started by adding 0.36 μM GFP-ssrA. GFP fluorescence was monitored in white, flat bottom 96-well plates (Greiner) over 120 min at excitation wavelength λ ex of 465 nm and emission at λ em of 535 nm using a spectrofluorometer (TECAN infinite M200 and TECAN Spark). The data shown is exemplary for three independently performed biological replicates. Pulldown assays. For the coelution of untagged ClpP1 with His-tagged ClpP2, E. coli SG1146a harboring the pETDUET-derived plasmid pETDUETshclpP1clpP2-His was cultured for 4 h at 30°C before coexpression of both proteins was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG. Then, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed, and the resulting supernatants were used for affinity chromatography as described above for His6-tagged proteins. The flowthrough, wash, and elution fractions were sampled and analyzed via SDS-PAGE. As a control, purified ClpP1 or ClpP2His (8 μM each) was passed in separate runs over a nickel-NTA chromatography column, and the flowthrough, wash, and elution fractions were collected and analyzed. For immunoblotting, protein samples were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo-Fisher) via semidry blotting for 1 h at 0.8 mA/cm2. For the detection of ClpP1 and ClpP2-His6, anti-ClpP1 (1:2,000) and anti-His6 (1:1,000) primary antibodies were employed. HRP-coupled secondary antibodies were used and resulting chemiluminescent signals were detected via a ChemiDoc documentation system (Bio-Rad). Experiments were performed at least in biological triplicates, and representative SDS-PAGE or Western blot images are shown. Intact-protein mass spectrometry. High-resolution intact protein mass spectrometry was performed to analyze the processing sites of ClpP1 and ClpP2His of S. hawaiiensis. Measurements were performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system coupled to an LTQ FT Ultra (Thermo) mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source (spray voltage, 4.0 kV; tube lens, 110 V; capillary voltage, 48 V; sheath gas, 60 arbitrary units [AU]; aux gas, 10 AU; and sweep gas, 0.2 AU). Reaction mixtures containing a total of about 1 to 10 pmol protein were desalted with a Massprep desalting cartridge (Waters) before measurement. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode, collecting full scans at high resolution (R = 200,000) from m/z 600 to m/z 2,000. The protein spectra were deconvoluted using the Thermo Xcalibur Xtract algorithm. Oligomerization studies via native PAGE. To visualize the formation of a ClpP1P2 heteromeric complex, the cross-linking reagent BS3 (bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate; Thermo-Fisher) was used to stabilize interactions between ClpP1 and ClpP2His. To this end, ClpP1, ClpP2, or a mixture of both ClpP1 and ClpP2 (6 μM each) was preincubated for 30 min at 30°C in activity buffer. For cross-linking reactions, a 50-fold molar excess of BS3 over the total ClpP concentration (6 mM BS3 for the mixed ClpP1P2 samples, or 3 mM BS3 for samples with either ClpP1 or ClpP2) was added to the samples. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30°C without shaking. Subsequently, the reactions were stopped by adding 20 mM Tris to the samples followed by further incubation for 15 min at room temperature. For analyzing the oligomeric behavior in the presence of ADEP1, ClpP1 and ClpP2 (10 μM each) were incubated with 60 μM ADEP1 (ClpP:ADEP1 ratio of 1:3) or 25 μM ADEP1 (ClpP:ADEP1 ratio of 1:1.25) for 3 h at 30°C. DMSO was used as a negative control. Samples were subjected to native PAGE at 25 V for approximately 16 h at 4°C. Gels were either Coomassie stained or used for immunoblotting employing PVDF membranes (Merck) as described above. To visualize a heteromeric ClpP1P2 complex, cross-linking experiments were conducted using the following activity buffer: 50 mM HEPES, 200 mM Na3C6H5O7, 20 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5. The experiment was performed with ClpP1P2 (10 or 15 μM each), which were incubated for 30 min at 30°C with ADEP1 (25 μM or 37.5 μM, respectively). Then, a 50-fold molar excess of BS3 over the total ClpP concentration was added to the samples and incubated for 30 min at 30°C. Samples were analyzed via native PAGE, using 4–12% Tris-glycine precast gels and ready-mixed native sample buffer (both Thermo-Fisher). Immunoblotting was performed as described above except for using PVDF membranes. ATPase activity. The ADP-Glo kinase assay (Promega) was utilized to measure the turn-over of ATP to ADP in ClpC1-mediated casein degradation assays according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In the first step, the reaction was conducted using ClpP1P2His (8 μM each), ClpC1 (8 μM), β-casein (10 μM) as a substrate, as well as ultrapure ATP (100 nM; Promega). After 60 min of incubation at 30°C, the reaction was stopped by adding ADP-Glo reagent to deplete the remaining ATP. ATP depletion was carried out for 40 min at room temperature. In a second step, the Kinase Detection Reagent was added for the conversion of ADP to ATP and incubated for 1 h at RT using a 384-well plate. In 384-well plates, 5 μL reaction mixture, 5 μL ADP-Glo reagent, and 10 μL of Kinase Detection Reagent were used. The converted ATP was then measured via a luciferase/luciferin reaction and ADP-Glo kinase assay luminescence was recorded. Bacterial strains, culture conditions, and cloning procedures for cell-based studies. All bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in Tables S1 and S2. Streptomyces wild-type and mutant strains were grown at 30°c on ms-mgcl2 agar (2% soy flour, 2% mannitol, 2% agar, 10 mm mgcl2) or in tryptic soy broth (TSB; BD Biosciences) with apramycin (50 μg/mL) and/or hygromycin B (50 μg/mL) as appropriate. E. coli strains were propagated in LB medium with apramycin (50 μg/mL), hygromycin B (50 μg/mL), kanamycin (25 μg/mL), and/or chloramphenicol (30 μg/mL) as required. For cloning purposes, DNA fragments of the genes of interest were PCR amplified and cloned into the respective vector via restriction-ligation utilizing E. coli JM109 or E. coli DH5α as cloning strains. All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing (LGC Genomics). Streptomyces vectors were conjugated into the respective Streptomyces strains via E. coli ET12567 pUB307 as described previously (79). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described above. For the generation of clpP deletion mutants, markerless gene knockouts were achieved by PCR-amplifying 1.5-kb long flanking regions of the respective gene, which were then integrated into the pGM-GUS-Xba vector by Gibson assembly using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB) and E. coli JM109 or E. coli DH5α as cloning hosts. After verification by Sanger sequencing, the knockout constructs were transformed into E. coli ET12567 pUB307 and conjugated into S. lividans TK24 as described previously (79). Mutant colonies were grown with apramycin at 39°C in TSB liquid cultures and subsequently on MS agar to maintain cells with integrated plasmids only. Spores were harvested and dilutions were plated on LB agar with 2 μg/mL of ADEP1 as selective pressure for plasmid loss. The obtained colonies were overlaid with 1 mL of an X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide) solution in water (1 mg/mL) for a blue-white screen. For white colonies, loss of the vector and the respective clpP gene was further verified by colony PCR and subsequent Sanger sequencing. Multiple sequence alignments were generated with the online tool clustalΩ (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Sequence identities were computed using Jalview Software (80). ADEP sensitivity assays. Spore suspensions of the respective Streptomyces strains were plated on nutrient extract agar (1% glucose, 0.2% yeast extract, 0.2% Casamino Acids, and 0.1% Lab-Lemco Powder, pH 7.0). Paper disks containing 20 μg of ADEP1 were added to the plates, which were subsequently incubated at 30°C for 2 days. Preparation of Streptomyces culture protein extracts. The respective Streptomyces strains were grown in 10 mL of TSB medium with apramycin and/or hygromycin as appropriate for 40 h at 30°C and 180 rpm. The mycelium was harvested and resuspended in 500 μL of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA disodium salt, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol; one cOmplete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet [Roche] per 10 mL of lysis buffer) in 2-mL lysis tubes. Upon cell disruption using the Precellys homogenizer, cell debris was removed by two centrifugation steps (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C followed by 14,000 rpm, 20 min, 4°C), and the concentration of the protein extracts was determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm with the NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
