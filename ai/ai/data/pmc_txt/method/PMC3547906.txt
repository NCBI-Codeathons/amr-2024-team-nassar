Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains and Plasmids S. plymuthica RVH1 served as the wild-type zeamine producer [15]. Escherichia coli Transformax EC100 and E. coli DH5α were used for BAC-library construction and routine subcloning purposes whereas E. coli S17-1 [53] was used for conjugative transfer of DNA to S. plymuthica RVH1. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC27661 was used in bioassays to monitor zeamine production. E. coli sdiA::Km
[54], a kanamycin resistant strain unable to react on N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone signals, functioned as a test strain to identify random transposon mutants of S. plymuthica RVH1 with an altered production of zeamine. Bacterial strains and plasmids used during this work are listed in Table S3. Growth and Culture Conditions S. plymuthica RVH1 was grown at 30°C in Lysogeny Broth (LB) for liquid cultivation and on LB agar (LB broth supplemented with 1.5% w/v agar) for solid cultivation. E. coli and S. aureus strains were grown at 37°C in LB broth and on LB-agar. When appropriate, media were supplemented with antibiotics at the following concentrations: kanamycin (50 µg/ml), ampicillin (100 µg/ml), chloramphenicol (50 µg/ml). Production and Isolation of Zeamine S. plymuthica RVH1 was grown in liquid LB-medium, supplemented with 5 µM synthetic N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-C6-homoserine lactone (Sigma), at 16°C for 48 h on a rotary shaker (80 rpm). Cells were removed by centrifugation (13000 rpm, 20 min) after which the supernatant was adjusted to pH 10.0 with 1 M NaOH and extracted with n-butanol twice. After acidification to pH 3.0 with acetic acid, the extract was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (20×250 mm, MeOH/CH2Cl2 [1/8 to 1/4 to 1/2 to 1/1 to 1/0] followed by MeOH/H2O [8/1 to 4/1 to 4/1+200 mM NaCl]). Zeamine antibiotics eluted when NaCl was added to the solvent. LC/MS analysis was performed on a Finnigan Surveyor HPLC system using a C18 reverse phase column (Thermo Scientific HyPURITY 5 µm C18 30×2.1 mm) and a solvent system consisting of MeOH in H2O supplemented with 0,1% formic acid (0–2 min 20%–95%, 2–3 min 95%, 3–4 min 95%-20%, 4–8 min 20%). Peaks were monitored with a mass detector (Finnigan LCQ Advantage Max ESI/MS). Structure Analysis of Zeamine MS analysis was performed on a quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Synapt G2 HDMS, Waters, Milford, MA). The instrument was operated at a resolution of 15000. Leucine enkephalin was used as reference for accurate mass measurements. The samples were dissolved in acetonitrile:water (1∶1) and infused at a flow rate of 5 uL/min. The capillary voltage was set to 3 kV. For NMR spectroscopy, samples were dissolved in 500 µl D2O with a final pH of 4.4. All spectra were recorded at 25°C on a Bruker Avance II 600 equipped with a 5 mm TCI HCN Z gradient cryoprobe. The Bruker Topspin 2.1 software was used to process the spectra. A 2D DQFCOSY [55] spectrum was measured with a spectral width of 6600 Hz in both dimensions using 64 scans and 512/2048 complex data points in t1 and t2, respectively. Heteronuclear correlation spectra were recorded using 64 scans and 1024/1024 complex data points and 200/11 ppm spectral widths in t1 and t2, respectively. The pulse sequence for the 2D gradient enhanced 1H-13C HSQC was as described by Sattler et al.
[56]. The delays Δ1 and Δ2 in the inept transfer were set to 1.67 ms (1/4JCH). The 2D HSQC–TOCSY consisted of an HSQC building block [57] (Δ1 = Δ2 = 1.67 ms) followed by a clean MLEV17 TOCSY transfer step [58] during a mixing time of 60 ms prior to detection. Decoupling during the acquisition of the HSQC and HSQC–TOCSY spectra was achieved by using the garp sequence [59]. Sine-bell shaped gradients were applied along the z-axis during the sequences to obtain coherence selection and sensitivity enhancement. Prior to Fourier transformation, a squared sine-bell function was applied in both dimensions of 2D spectra. Bioassay for Zeamine Production Zeamine production was monitored by bioassay. An LB agar plate was overlaid with a lawn of stationary phase S. aureus ATCC27661 cells, diluted to OD600nm = 0,03 (5 µ/ml) and 10 µl samples of 18 h grown S. plymuthica RVH1 cultures were spotted on top. After incubation for 48 h at 16°C and 24 h at 30°C, the size of the inhibition zones was evaluated. ‘Soft Agar Halo Method After overnight incubation of indicator strains at 30°C in LB-medium, 50 µl of the stationary cultures was added to a petridish and mixed with LB soft agar (LB broth supplemented with 0.7% w/v agar). 5 µl of an overnight stationary culture of S. plymuthica RVH1 was spotted on top. To allow the growth of strain RVH1 before that of the test strains, the plates were incubated for 2 days at 16°C before further incubation at 30°C for 24 h. This way, a clear halo surrounded by a turbid lawn was visible around the RVH1 spot in case of a sensitive test strain. Random Transposon Mutagenesis and Identification of Genes Involved in Zeamine Biosynthesis Random transposon mutagenesis was performed by transferring the suicide plasmid pUT mini-Tn5 lacZ1 from E. coli S17-1 λpir to an S. plymuthica RVH1 splI insertion mutant which is deficient in quorum sensing [11], [60]. Using the soft agar halo method described above, mutant strains with reduced or absent growth inhibition zone were identified on LB soft agar using a kanamycin resistant test strain unable to react on signal molecules (E. coli sdiA::Km) and kanamycin as selection marker. Synthetic N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-C6-homoserine lactone (OHHL) signal was added to the plates to ensure maximal antibiotic production. To identify the site of transposon insertion, sonicated (Vibracell Sonics and Materials Inc.) genomic DNA of the selected mutants was ligated into SmaI digested pUC18 vectors and transformed into E. coli DH5α, followed by selection on LB-agar supplemented with ampicillin. The genes flanking the transposon insertions were identified by sequencing using the pUC24bis, pUC47 and KmKleckner primers (Table S2). Genomic Library Construction and Screening BAC-library construction of S. plymuthica strain RVH1 was performed as described by Osoegawa et al. [61]. High-molecular-weight DNA was embedded in plugs, partially digested with HindIII and size selected by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Subsequent cloning in pIndigoBAC5 (Epicentre) vectors and transformation to E. coli Transformax™ EC100™ were performed as described by the manufacturer. This yielded a library of 3840 clones with an average insert size of 130 kb resulting in 92-fold coverage. Using the identified sequences flanking the transposon insertion sites as template for primer design, the library was screened by PCR to localize the zeamine biosynthesis genes. A HindIII restriction digest and BAC end sequencing using pINDIGO BAC-5 vector primers aided in selecting the best BAC clone for further analysis. For an overview of the oligonucleotide primers used in this study, see Table S2. DNA Sequencing and Analysis The selected BAC-clone was subcloned using pUC19 vectors and sequenced by a combination of primer walking and shotgun sequencing. Sequencing reactions were run using Big Dye Terminator mix (Applied Biosystems), purified and analyzed on an ABI 3130 genetic analyzer. Sequence assembly into contigs was performed using Sequencher 4.8 software (Gene Codes Corporation, USA). ORF predictions were carried out by combining comparative genomics approaches (tBLASTx) and the ORF Finder (NCBI) and Genemark.hmm algorithms [62].
