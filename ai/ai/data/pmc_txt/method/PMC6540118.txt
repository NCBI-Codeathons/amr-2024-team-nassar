Materials and methods  Tissue specimens During the period from January 2016 to May 2018, 62 patients with OSCC who underwent surgical resection in Nanjing General Hospital (Nanjing, China) were included, there were 34 patients with cisplatin resistance and 28 patients with cisplatin sensitivity. After all the specimens were removed from the blood by physiological saline, they were cut into EP tubes and stored in a −80°C refrigerator. All the above procedures were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Nanjing General Hospital. Signed informed consents were obtained from the patients or guardians. Materials and cells Tca8113/CDDP cells (cat. no. TC-hxbz-479)were purchased from Shanghai Kanglang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and gradually induced to become resistant strains by gradient concentration of cisplatin from low concentration to high concentration for 2 months. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). RPMI-1640 medium was purchased from Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA). Anti-FZD3 monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; cat. no. ab217032), anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody (1:5,000; cat. no. ab32572), anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (1:5,000; cat. no. ab181602) and sheep anti-rabbit secondary polyclonal antibody (1:5,000; cat. no. ab10183) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Culture of Tca8113/CDDP resistant cells Tca8113/CDDP resistant cells were routinely cultured with 10% FBS and a certain amount of penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.; 15140-122) was added. The culture conditions were 37°C and 5% incubator constant temperature culture. In order to maintain the drug resistance of Tca8113/CDDP-resistant cells, stimulation with cisplatin at a concentration of 5 µmol/l per month was necessary. All the cells used in this experimental study were in log phase growth. In the subsequent experiments, OSCC cells were divided into two groups, the resistant group: DRG; the resistant group + miR-27b mimic group: DRG+miR-27b mimic. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reation (RT-qPCR) detection of related gene expression i) TRIzol method was performed to extract total RNA in cells or tissues (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and then UV spectrophotometer (UV-1800; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) was used to detect the concentration and purity of the extracted RNA, A260/A280 should reach 1.8–2.0 for further experiment; ii) the mRNA was synthesized into cDNA by reverse transcription and stored in a refrigerator at −80°C; iii) RT-PCR system: 10X buffer 2.5 µl; cDNA 2 µl; forward primer (20 µmol/l) 0.25 µl; reverse primer (20 µmol/l) 0.25 µl; dNTPs (10 mmol/l) 0.5 µl; Taq enzyme (2×106 U/l) 0.5 µl; ddH2O 19 µl. The amplification systems for RT-PCR were identical. The primer sequences of each index in RT-qPCR are shown in Table I. The suppliers of RT and PCR apparatus were Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., and Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis, Missouri, MO, USA). Western blot analysis i) The culture medium was discarded, and washed with PBS 3 times; ii) 1,000 µl RIPA lysate (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was added per dish and shaken well for 20 min; iii) the brush was used to fully scrape the cells at the bottom of the dish and the cells were collected in EP tubes; iv) the collected cells were lysed by an ultrasonic pyrolyzer for ~15 sec; v) after standing for 15 min, centrifuged at 10,000 × g and 4°C for 30 min; vi) the supernatant was dispensed into the EP tube, the BCA method (BCA protein concentration kit; Biosharp Life Sciences, Hefei, China) and ultraviolet spectrometry was performed to measure the protein concentration, and the protein of all samples was made up to the same concentration and vii) the samples were put in a −80°C refrigerator after dispensing. After extracting the total protein of OSCC resistant cells, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis could be performed with 10% separation gel and 10 µl of protein was added to each lane. After electrophoresis, the proteins in the gel were transferred into a PVDF membrane and blocked with non-fat milk (1×TBST), and the primary antibody was incubated at 4°C overnight, and then incubated in sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibody in the dark for 1 h; prepared ECL mixture (ECL kit; Beyotime Biotechnology) was added; protein bands were scanned and quantified using an Odyssey membrane sweeper (Odyssey, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA), and GAPDH was used to correct the level of protein to be tested. Image Lab 4.0 software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to quantify. Cloning formation experiments Each group of cells was cultured to logarithmic growth phase, digested into single cell suspensions with 0.25% trypsin, and the single cell ratio was guaranteed to be >95%. The cell suspension was then inoculated into a 6-well plate with ~500 cells/well. Subsequently, 2 ml of RPMI-1640 medium was added to each well and the solution was changed every 48 h. After 10 days, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet, and the number of cell clones in each well plate was counted. Flow cytometry to detect apoptosis OSCC cell suspension in logarithmic growth phase were prepared by digesting with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and inoculated on 6-well plate medium. The apoptosis rate was measured according to the procedure of the apoptosis detection kit Annexin V-FITC PI (Biotime, Shanghai, China). Hoechst 33258 staining After adding miR-27b for 24 h, resistant OSCC cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 staining kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The specific protocol was as described in the manufacturers instructions. After the staining, photographs were taken using a fluorescence microscope (XSP-63XD, Shanghai Optical Instrument Factory Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and three fields of view were randomly selected for each slide. Finally, Hoechst positive cells were counted and quantified. Scratch test Cells in logarithmic growth phase were seeded in 96-well plates to ensure that the number of cells per plate was ~5×104 cells. At 24 h, the well was scratched in the middle with a pipette tip. The cells dropped by the scratches were washed with PBS, and replaced with serum-free medium. The cell migration was photographed under a microscope at 24 h. Invasion experiment Matrigel was diluted at a ratio of 1:8, coated with Transwell chamber (8 µm), and incubated in a 37°C incubator for 2 h to form a gel. Subsequently, the two groups of cells were separately diluted into a single cell suspension with serum-free medium, and then inoculated into the Transwell upper chamber (density of 5×104 cells/100 µl), and the lower chamber was added with 10% FBS medium, and cultured for 24 h. The transmembrane cells were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet and photographed. Statistical analysis All data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Measurement data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and data comparison between the two groups was performed by t-test. P<0.05 represents a statistically significant difference.
