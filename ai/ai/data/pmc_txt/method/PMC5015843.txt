Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and culture conditions Y. pestis intraspecies classification used in this study corresponds to the International Codex of Bacterial Nomenclature [4, 18, 19]. In this study, we used a total of 119 strains of Y. pestis representing seven out of eight belonging to subsp. microtus biovars, such as caucasica (78), altaica (17), qinghaiensis (2), xilingolensis (3), hissarica (4), talassica (4), and ulegeica (11) [4], as well as belonging to the main subsp. pestis a vaccine strain EV line NIIEG (bv. orientalis) and a wild type strain 231 (bv. antique). Characteristics of the strains used for testing of serologic cross-reactivity and cross-protection are shown in Table 1. In addition, avirulent bacteria, Pgm− vaccine strain EV, as well as strains C-376pCD1− and C-824pCD1−, depleted of the low-calcium-response virulence plasmid were used for all Y. pestis-derived Caf1 preparations.

Bacteria were grown at 28°C for 48 h on brain heart infusion (BHI; HiMedia Laboratories) supplemented with 2% agar at pH 7.2. For Caf1 isolation and purification, bacteria were grown at 37°C in New Brunswick Scientific fermenters with working volumes up to 10 L of liquid aerated media. Growth medium was BHI supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (Difco). Acidity and oxygen levels were controlled with a specified pO2 value >10%. Biomasses were harvested by centrifugation after 48 h. All handling of samples containing live wild-type Y. pestis isolates was performed in a select agent authorized BSL3 facility under protocols approved by the State Research Center for Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology Institutional Biosafety Committee. Sequencing of caf1 genes The nucleotide sequence of each caf1 gene was determined by direct sequencing of the PCR fragment obtained after amplification of the part of caf1 operon of the corresponding strain. The primers caf1-F (5'-GAATTTGTTCGTGGATTGGA-3') and caf1-R (5'-TTAAAGGAGGGCATAATAGC-3'), both flanking the caf1 gene, were located within the caf1A and YPMT1.85 (similar to a fragment of integrase) genes, respectively, and were used for both fragment amplification and direct sequencing. Determined sequences of the caf1 genes were deposited to the GenBank (accession numbers KP641181.1-KP641299.1) and compared to reported sequences of this gene in other Y. pestis strains.). Intrinsic disorder analysis Amino acid sequences of three Caf1 isoforms were analyzed for the effect of the polymorphism on the intrinsic disorder propensities of related proteins. The intrinsic disorder of these Caf1 isoforms were evaluated by three disorder predictors, PONDR® VSL2 [21], which is one of the more accurate stand-alone disorder predictors [21–23], PONDR® VLXT [24], which is not the most accurate disorder predictor but has a high sensitivity to local sequence peculiarities which are often associated with the disorder-based interaction sites [25, 26], and a metapredictor PONDR® FIT [27], which is more accurate than each of its component predictors, PONDR® VLXT [24], PONDR® VSL2 [21], PONDR® VL3 [28], FoldIndex [29], and IUPred [30]. Since intrinsically disordered proteins or proteins with intrinsically disordered regions are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions and molecular recognitions [25, 31–43] and undergo at least partial disorder-to-order transitions upon binding [25, 33, 43–50], these potential disorder-based binding sites can be identified by various computational means, such as the ANCHOR algorithm [51, 52]. Isolation and purification of Caf1 isoforms Avirulent bacteria, Pgm− vaccine strain EV, as well as strains C-376pCD1− and C-824pCD1−, depleted of the low-calcium response virulence plasmid were used for all Y. pestis-derived Caf1 preparations. Cell-free Caf1 was extracted directly from the supernatants of Y. pestis broth cultures and purified by chromatography. Clarified Caf1 supernatant was slowly mixed with 4 M ammonia sulfate (AS) solution to achieve a 1 M final concentration, and precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 15000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. A HiPrep Phenyl FF (High Sub) 16/10 column (GE Healthcare) was used for the initial chromatography step. Prior to sample loading, the column was equilibrated with 5 column volumes of a 20 mM Tris buffer, supplemented with 1 M AS (pH 8.0). Clarified supernatant was loaded and subjected to the following steps: 4 column volumes 1 M AS + 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0; 100%– 0% AS + 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 over ten column volumes; hold with 0% AS buffer for 4 column volumes. Ten mL fractions were collected for each elution step. All fractions were analyzed using 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing protein Caf1 were combined and concentrated by a second passage through a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) column. Protein was concentrated by a single step elution by 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The fractions were desalted on a XK 26/30 column (GE Healthcare) packed with Toyopearl HW-40F chromatographic media (Tosoh Bioscience) and pre- equilibrated with 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0. Ten mL fractions were collected, and purified Caf1 protein was concentrated using Millipore YM-10 membrane for a subsequent storage at -70°C until used. Ethics Statement All protocols for animal experiments were approved by the State Research Center for Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology Bioethics Committee (Permit No: VP-2015/2) and were performed in compliance with the NIH Animal Welfare Insurance #A5476-01 issued on 02/07/2007, and the European Union guidelines and regulations on handling, care and protection of Laboratory Animals (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/home_en.htm). Mice Seven week old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Laboratory Animals Breeding Center (Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russia), housed in polycarbonate cages, and maintained in light-controlled (lights on from 7:00 to 19:00) BSL3 room at the State Research Center for Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology. The temperature and the humidity of the animal room were maintained at 22°C ± 2°C and 50% ± 10%, respectively. Mice were given tap water and mouse mixed fodder PK-120 (Laboratorkorm, Russia) ad libitum throughout the study. The number of mouse for experiments used the minimum number of the necessity. The mice were divided into all groups randomly. In this study, we have used humane endpoints for the infected animals. According to the animal protocol the mice should be euthanized in the animal survival studies, when they became either of the following: lethargic, dehydrated, moribund, unable to rise, non-responsive to touch, or lost more than 10% body mass. Humane euthanasia, CO2 exposure (anesthesia) using compressed CO2 gas followed by cervical dislocation has been used by well-trained individuals. We have monitored the health condition of the animals at least twice a day. There was no unexpected death during the entire set of experiments. Animal immunization Mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 96 per group) and vaccinated subcutaneously (s.c.) with 10 μg of each Caf1 isoform in 0.1 mL PBS (pH 7.2) adsorbed (1:10, w/w) to the vehicle, aluminum hydroxide gel colloidal suspension (Sigma, USA), or only with the vehicle in PBS as a negative control (placebo). After 30 days, the animals were boosted with an identical dose of the same antigen into the same inoculation site. Serologic cross-reactivity Immunochemical specificity of Caf1 isoforms was assessed with the immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic test for plague that utilizes the anti-Y. pestis Caf1NT1 monoclonal antibody F19 (State Research Center for Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Russia). Blood samples were obtained under anesthesia with CO2 gas by retro-orbital route by well-trained individuals. Antibody titers were determined by indirect ELISA a day before and 43 days after the second Caf1 immunization individually in five randomly selected animals from each group of 96 mice immunized with one of the Caf1 isoforms, and the mean titer was calculated. Microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One, Austria) were coated with 100 ng/well of Caf1 in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) overnight at 4°C. Non-specific binding was blocked with 3% gelatin from cold water fish skin (Sigma) in 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.2. Test sera were added using 2.5-fold serial dilutions in 0.01 M PBS buffer containing 0.05% tween-20 (PBST) and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. After four washes with 0.01 M PBST, 100 μl of sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare) at a dilution of 1:4000 was added for 1.5 h at 37°C. The plates were washed with PBST and 100 μl of 0.01% o-phenylendiamine-H2O2 was added to each well. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 M H2SO4 per well, and OD was read at 450 nm using EVOLIS Twin Plus System (BIO-RAD, USA). The titer of antibodies was estimated as the maximum dilution of serum giving an OD reading that exceeded the background by 0.1. Background values were obtained from serum samples collected from the animals injected with the vehicle alone. Cross-protection The ability of an antigen isoform to protect an animal from death after administration of a high dose of a virulent strain producing a different isoform of the same antigen, designated Immunity Index (II) was calculated as the ratio:
II=LD50imm/LD50veh(1)
where LD50imm is LD50 for animals immunized with an antigen under the study; LD50veh is LD50 for vehicle-treated animals. To estimate LD50, 45 days after the booster dose, four groups of mice were infected with virulent strains producing either of the Caf1 isoforms (See Table 1). Each group was subdivided into three subgroups of 32 mice that were challenged with 10-fold dilutions of virulent strains of Y. pestis (231 (NT1), C-376 (NT2), and C-824 (NT3)), (a. 2 × 103 to 2 LD50; eight mice for a dose) subcutaneously (in the interior thigh). Animals that succumbed to infection were sacrificed and examined bacteriologically to verify that infection was the cause of death. The remaining animals were observed for three weeks. The animals that survived were humanely euthanized. Statistical methods Data on ELISA were expressed as means ±SEM (standard error of the mean). The LD50 and a 95% confidence intervals of the virulent strains for immunized and naïve animals were calculated using the Kärber method [53]. Mortality timeframes were recorded, and the mean life to death time span was calculated for each treatment group. Comparison of the survival curves was performed using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. A P value below 0.05 was considered to be significant.
