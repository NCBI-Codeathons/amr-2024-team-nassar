Materials and Methods Description of Raw Materials Fresh swine manure was taken from the boutique pig farm of Huazhong Agricultural University. Sawdust from the Veterinary Hospital of Huazhong Agricultural University was approximately 0.5–1 cm in size. The total carbon content of the swine manure was 360.8 g/kg, the total nitrogen content was 30.4 g/kg, and the water content was 69.25%. The total carbon content in sawdust was 471.9 g/kg, the total nitrogen content was 2.2 g/kg, and the water content was 9.38%. Composting Process This composting experiment was conducted in November 2018 at the National Animal Engineering Technology Research Center of Huazhong Agricultural University. Each composting device was a 60-L rectangular foam container (280 × 540 × 400 cm). And it was perforated with one ventilation hole (2 × 2 cm) on the side of the insulation wall. The composting device is very similar to the research from Duan et al. (2019). Two composting experiments were labeled as CK (swine manure + sawdust) and AB (swine manure + sawdust + 1% compound microbial agents − Bacillus subtilis: Bacillus licheniformis: Bacillus megaterium: Yeasts = 1:1:1:2). The initial volume of the compost material is about 50 L, and the fresh weight is about 17 kg. Accordingly, B. subtilis have been deposited in China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC) and the CCTCC NO: M2019185. These strains were isolated from previous swine manure composting samples. The C/N of the two experimental materials was adjusted to ⁓20, and the water content was ⁓60%. The composting device was connected to the blower, the blast volume was 5 L/kg∙min, and the ventilation was 5 min per hour. Compost Sample Collection Composting samples were collected individually from the upper, central, and lower portions of the compost to achieve high representativeness of samples in different height layers. Samples collected on days 0 (initial phase), 1 (mesophilic phase), 2 (thermophilic phase), 5 (cooling phase), 12 (maturation phase), and 32 (maturation phase) were designated as detection ARGs samples. At the same time, samples collected on days 1 (mesophilic phase), 2 (thermophilic phase), and 32 (maturation phase) were used to analyze changes in microbial community structure. Each sample was split into two parts: one part was stored at −80°C for subsequent DNA extraction, and another part was stored at 4°C for later chemical analysis. Physicochemical Index Analyses The temperature at the center of each composting container was measured at 9:00 AM daily using a thermometer. At the same time, the room temperature was also recorded daily. Each compost sample and deionized water were mixed at a ratio of 1:10 W(g): V(ml) and shaken at room temperature for 1 h. The pH of the extract was measured. Moisture content was measured by drying in an oven at 105°C for 24 h or until no change in dry weight. Analysis of the total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), and C/N ratios of the samples was performed by using an elemental analyzer (Vario MAX-CN Germany Elementar). DNA Extraction and qPCR Total genomic DNA was extracted using the Fecal DNA Kit (Simgen, Hangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nine tetracycline resistance genes (tetA, tetC, tetG, tetH, tetL, tetM, tetO, tetQ, and tetW), five macrolide resistance genes (ermA, ermB, ermC, ermF, and ermQ), two sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2), two β-lactamase resistance genes (blaCTX and blaTEM), the integrase gene intI1, and the transposon gene tn916 were analyzed by qPCR (Table 1). The qPCR mixtures (total volume, 10 μl) consisted of 5 μl of Hieff qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Yeasen, China), 1 μl of template DNA, 0.2 μl of each primer (10 μM), and 3.6 μl of ddH2O. qPCR was performed using a LightCycler®96 system (Roche, Switzerland). Each reaction is repeated three times. The qPCR conditions comprised 5 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles for 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at the annealing temperatures shown in Table 1, and then 30 s at 72°C. The calibration curve of qPCR was generated using plasmids that carried the target genes. The copy number of ARGs was calculated by the square of the related coefficient (R2) of the standard curve >0.99 using the external reference method. PCR primer sequences and annealing temperature.

D1 represents the heating period, D2 represents the high-temperature period, D32 represents the ripening period, and there were three replicates of each group of samples for a total of 18 samples. The V3–V4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were amplified with primers 338F (5'-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3') and 806R (5'-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3') by a PCR thermocycler system (GeneAmp 9700, ABI, United States). The high-throughput sequencing method is consistent with Li et al. (2020). Purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar amounts and paired-end sequenced (2 × 300) on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, United States) according to standard protocols by Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Statistical Analysis GraphPad Prism 7 was used to generate various figures. Averages and SDs of ARGs were determined using Microsoft Excel 2010. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing data were analyzed on the free online I-Sanger Cloud Platform of Majorbio. In addition, we compared the resulting sequences with the constructed Human Pathogenic Bacteria (HPB) database. The HPB database was provided by Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm Technology Co., Ltd. The HPB relative abundances were calculated at the genus level.
