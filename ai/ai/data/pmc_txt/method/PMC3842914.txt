Materials and Methods Bacterial strains The bacterial strains used in the antibacterial activity assays were obtained from the Culture Collection of Antimicrobial Resistant Microbes of Korea and the Korean Collection for Type Cultures. The pump-negative (tolC) E. coli EW1b was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center of Yale University. Screening and isolation of compound 1 Over 25,000 microbial extracts composed of actinomycetes and fungi were screened against S. aureus FabI and confirmed through a target-based whole cell assay by using fabI-overexpressing S. aureus. This analysis led to the identification of compound 1 from fungal strain F717 (Fig. 1). Compound 1 was isolated from the fermented whole medium of the fungal strain F717, which was isolated from seashore slime collected at Daechun beach, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea. The strain was identified as Penicillium chrysogenum based on standard biological and physiological tests and taxonomic determination. Seed culture was conducted in a liquid culture medium containing 2% glucose, 0.2% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.05% MgSO4, and 0.1% KH2PO4 (pH 5.7 before sterilization). A sample of the strain from a mature plate culture was inoculated into a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 80 mL of the above sterile seed liquid medium and cultured on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 28°C for 3 days. Subsequently, 5 mL of the seed culture was transferred into 500-mL Erlenmeyer flasks (54 flasks) containing 80 g of bran medium, which was cultivated for 7 days at 28°C to produce the active compound. The culture solid state was extracted with 80% acetone, and the extract was concentrated in vacuo to an aqueous solution. The aqueous solution was then extracted 3 times with an equal volume of ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The EtOAc extract was concentrated in vacuo to dryness. The crude extract was subjected to SiO2 (Merck Art No. 7734.9025) column chromatography followed by stepwise elution with CHCl3-MeOH (100∶1, 50∶1, and 10∶1). The active fractions eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (50∶1) were pooled and concentrated in vacuo to give an oily residue. The residue was applied again to a Sephadex LH-20 and then eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (1∶1). The active fraction was dissolved in MeOH and was further purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (20×150 mm; YMC C18) by using a photodiode array detector. The column was eluted using MeOH: H2O (75∶25) at a flow rate of 5 mL/min to afford compound 1 with >99% purity at a retention time of 19.4 min. The chemical structure of compound 1 was determined to be meleagrin [23] by mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra as follows: [α]D  = −96.7° (c = 0.04, MeOH); HRESI-MS: m/z 434.18463 (M+H)+, C23H23N5O4 requires 434.18228; 1H-NMR (600 MHz, DMSO-d6): 8.30 (1H, s, NH-19), 8.17 (1H, s, H-15), 7.77 (1H, s, H-20), 7.53 (1H, d, J = 7.5, H-4), 7.34 (1H, s, H-18), 7.25 (1H, t, J = 7.5, H-6), 7.03 (1H, t, J = 7.5, H-5), 6.96 (1H, d, J = 7.5, H-7), 6.00 (1H, brs, H-22), 5.25 (1H, s, H-8), 5.01 (1H, d, J = 17.1, Ha-23), 4.98 (1H, d, J = 9.0, Hb-23), 3.66 (3H, s, 1-OCH3), 1.19 (6H, s, CH3-24 and 25), 13C-NMR (150 MHz, DMSO-d6): 165.0 (C-13), 158.6 (C-10), 146.2 (C-7a), 143.3 (C-22), 142.7 (C-9), 137.6 (C-20), 134.1 (C-18), 127.8 (C-6), 126.0 (C-3a), 125.9 (C-16), 124.7 (C-4), 123.7 (C-12), 123.1 (C-5), 112.8 (C-23), 111.6 (C-7), 109.2 (C-8), 106.7 (C-15), 101.5 (C-2), 64.8 (1-OCH3), 52.2 (C-3), 41.8 (C-21), and 23.0 (C-24 and 25). Preparation of derivatives of compound 1 Several derivatives of 1 were obtained by chemical modification of functional groups such as hydroxyl and amine groups (Fig. 1). Demethoxylation of compound 1 afforded glandicolin A (2) together with compound 7 as a byproduct. Methylation of compound 1 produced oxaline (3), N14-methylmeleagrin (4), and O,N14-dimethylmeleagrin (5). O,N14-dimethylglandicolin (6) was obtained by methylation of compound 2. Details regarding the preparation procedures and spectral data of compounds 2–7 are presented in Information S1. FabI and FabK assay S. aureus FabI and E. coli FabI enzymes were cloned, overexpressed, and purified as described previously [24]. The wild-type fabK gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA obtained from Streptococcus pneumoniae KCTC 5412 by using the primers 5′-GGAAACCATATGAAAACGCGTATTACGAA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGTCATTTCTTACAACTCCTGT-3′, which contained NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. After the DNA sequence was confirmed, the gene was cloned into the pET22b vector (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ, USA). The construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression following induction with isopropylthiogalactoside. The C-terminal His-tagged protein was purified as described previously [24]. Assays were conducted in half-area, 96-well microtiter plates. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and evaluated in 100-μL assay mixtures containing components specific for each enzyme (see below). Reduction of the trans-2-octenoyl N-acetylcysteamine (t-o-NAC thioester) substrate analog was measured spectrophotometrically following the utilization of NADH or NADPH at 340 nm at 30°C for the linear period of the assay. S. aureus FabI assays contained 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 6.5), 200 μM t-o-NAC thioester, 200 μM NADPH, and 150 nM S. aureus FabI. NADH was used as a cofactor rather than NADPH for the E. coli FabI assay. Substrate concentrations used for the Lineweaver–Burk plot were 100, 200, 300, and 400 μM, whereas the concentrations of the cofactor were 100, 200, 400, and 600 μM. The rate of decrease in the amount of NADPH in each reaction was measured with a microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader by using the SOFTmax PRO software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The inhibitory activity was calculated according to the following formula: % of inhibition  = 100× [1− (rate in the presence of compound/rate in the untreated control)]. IC50 values were calculated by fitting the data to a sigmoid equation. An equal volume of DMSO solvent was used for the untreated control. FabK assays contained 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 6.5), 2% glycerol, 200 mM NH4Cl, 50 µM t-o-NAC thioester, 200 µM NADH, and 150 nM S. pneumoniae FabK. Fluorescence quenching assay Fluorescence spectra were measured using a SHIMADZU fluorescence spectrophotometer (model RF-5310PC). S. aureus FabI (15 ng/μl) was incubated with different concentrations of triclosan (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 nM in PBS buffer) and compounds 1, 5, or 7 (10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 nM in PBS buffer). Protein quenching was monitored at 25°C by using 5-nm excitation and 5-nm emission wavelength. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission spectra were measured between 290 and 430 nm. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) Whole-cell antimicrobial activity was determined by broth microdilution as described previously [21]. The test strains except for S. pneumoniae were grown to mid-log phase in Mueller–Hinton broth and diluted 1,000-fold in the same medium. Cells (105/mL) were inoculated into Mueller–Hinton broth and dispensed at 0.2 mL/well into a 96-well microtiter plate. S. pneumoniae was grown in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 5% sheep blood. MICs were determined in triplicate by serial 2-fold dilutions of test compounds. The MIC was defined as the concentration of a test compound that completely inhibited cell growth during a 24-h incubation at 30°C. Bacterial growth was determined by measuring the absorption at 650 nm by using a microtiter ELISA reader. Measurement of the inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis To monitor the effects of compound 1 on lipid, DNA, RNA, protein, and cell wall biosynthesis, its effects on the incorporation of [1-14C] acetate (50 mCi/mmol), [2-14C] thymidine (59.8 mCi/mmol), [U-14C] uridine (539 mCi/mmol), L-[U-14C] leucine (306 mCi/mmol) or L-[U-14C] isoleucine (329 mCi/mmol), and N-acetyl-d-[1-14C] glucosamine (58.1 mCi/mmol) into S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were measured as described previously [21]. S. aureus was exponentially grown to an A650 of 0.2 in Mueller–Hinton broth. S. pneumoniae was grown in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Each 1-mL culture was treated with drugs at 2 times the MIC for 10 min. An equal volume of DMSO solvent was added to the untreated control. After incubation with the radiolabeled precursors at 37°C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation, the cell pellets were washed twice with PBS buffer. After acetate incorporation, the total cellular lipids were extracted with chloroform-methanol-water. The incorporated radioactivity in the chloroform phase was measured by scintillation counting. For the other precursors, incorporation was terminated by adding 10% (w/v) TCA and cooling on ice for 20 min. The precipitated material was collected on Whatman GF/C glass microfiber filters, washed with TCA and ethanol, dried, and counted using a scintillation counter. The total counts incorporated at 1 h of incubation without inhibitors ranged from >7,000 for [U-14C] uridine to <13,000 for [1-14C] acetate. The inhibition of radiolabeled precursor incorporation was calculated using the following formula: % inhibition  = 100× [1− (radioactivity values of the treated samples/control (no antibacterial) values)]. In all experiments, known antibacterial agents were included as positive controls. Frequency of the spontaneously resistant mutant The frequency of spontaneous resistance was determined for S. aureus RN4220, S. aureus KCTC 1916, and E. coli KCTC 1942. E. coli KCTC 1942 is highly sensitive to antibiotics. The organisms were grown to log-phase by dilution of an overnight culture in fresh media and re-incubation at 35°C until the cultures reached a cell density of approximately 109 CFU/mL. A volume of 100 μl of the bacterial suspension was then applied to solid media containing 4× MIC of 1, 5, or triclosan. Inocula were determined by applying 100 μl of 10-fold dilutions on solid media without drug. Colony-forming units were counted after 48 h incubation at 35°C. The ratio of the number of colonies on drug-containing plates to that on control plates was calculated as the in vitro frequency of isolation of CFU. Overexpression assay An overexpression assay using S. aureus RN4220, S. aureus RN4220 (pE194), and S. aureus RN4220 (pE194-fabI) was conducted to perform target validation of FabI inhibitors as described previously [21]. Additionally, both fabI- and fabK-overexpressing E. coli were constructed to test a multitarget effect of the compounds. The wild-type fabI gene from the genomic DNA of E. coli W3110 was amplified by PCR by using the primers 5′-ATGGGTTTTCTTTCCGGTAAGCGCA-3′ and 5′-TTTCAGTTCGAGTTCGTTCATT-3′. The wild-type fabK gene from the genomic DNA of S. pneumoniae KCTC 5412 was amplified by PCR by using the primers 5′-ATGAAAACGCGTATTACA-3′ and 5′-GTCATTTCTTAC AACTCCTGTCCA-3′. The resulting products were cloned into the pBAD-TOPO TA expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to yield the pBAD-fabI and pBAD-fabK recombinant plasmids, which placed the expression of the genes fabI and fabK, respectively, under the control of the arabinose promoter [25]. Recombinant pBAD-fabI and pBAD-fabK were then introduced into the pump-negative (tolC) E. coli EW1b via electroporation to generate E. coli EW1b (pBAD-fabI) and E. coli EW1b (pBAD-fabK), respectively.
