Materials and Methods General Medium ingredients, biochemicals, and reagents were purchased from Oxoid Ltd (United Kingdom), Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (China), Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (United States), and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China), unless otherwise stated. Restriction enzymes and DNA ligases used for gene manipulation were from New England Biolabs (United States), Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Ltd (United States), and Takara Biotechnology (Dalian) Co., Ltd (China). DNA polymerases used for PCR amplifications were from Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd (China). PCR primers and chemically synthesized genes were synthesized by GENEWIZ Suzhou (China), and listed in Supplementary Table S1. Sequence Analysis of Rox Homologs As of November 13, 2019, a total of 4,886 protein sequences were retrieved via NCBI BLASTp when using the N. farcinica Rox sequence as query under default parameters. These sequences were first clustered via BLASTClust at 80% identity (Alva et al., 2016), and 1,132 representative sequences were obtained. The representative sequences were then used to construct a sequence similarity network under default parameters with an Alignment Score of 110 (Gerlt et al., 2015). Protein Expression and Purification DNA isolation and manipulation in actinomycete strains or E. coli were performed according to standard methods (Kieser et al., 2000). PCR amplifications were carried out on a Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were purified (Sangon Biotech) and cloned into the expression vector pET-28a(+) (Novagen). The resultant recombinant plasmids were introduced into the bacterial expression strain E. coli BL21(DE3). When the E. coli cultures were grown to an OD600 of approximate 0.8 at 37°C in LB medium (800 mL in a 2 L flask, kanamycin 50 μg mL–1), the protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, followed by incubation at 16°C for 20 h. For the expression of AmRox, the chaperone plasmid pGro7 (Takara Biotechnology) was required for the assistance of the protein folding and stability. The cultures were harvested and centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 min. The resultant bacterial pellet was resuspended in 35 mL lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol, pH 8.0), and supersonicated to release the target protein. The N-terminally His-tagged protein was purified by the Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen). The elution conditions were 30, 10, 10, 4, 4, 4 × 3 mL buffer (100 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0) containing 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 400 mM imidazole, respectively. Finally, the eluted protein with a yellow color from a buffer containing 400 mM imidazole was desalted using the stock buffer (100 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0) by a PD-10 Desalting Column (GE Healthcare). The purified protein was stored at -80°C for subsequent enzymatic assays. Enzymatic Assays and Product Analyses The monooxygenation reaction was carried out in a 200 μL system containing 5–10 μM enzyme, 100 μM substrate, 1 mM NADPH, 100 mM HEPES, and 150 mM NaCl, with a pH 7.0, as described previously (Koteva et al., 2018). The reaction was first incubated at 25°C for 1 h, then quenched by mixing with 200 μL methanol, and finally centrifuged at 13,800 g for 5 min. The supernatant was directly used for the HPLC (-MS) analysis. The HPLC (Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity) analytic conditions are as follows. The mobile phases A is H2O (+0.1% formic acid) and B is acetonitrile (+0.1% formic acid). The gradient condition is 0–2 min 20% B, 2–7 min 20–50% B, 7–9 min 50% B, 9–12 min 50–60% B, 12–14 min 60% B, 14–17 min 60–80% B, 17–19 min 80% B, 19–23 min 80–95% B, 23–28 min 95% B, 28–30 min 95–20% B, and 30–33 min 20% B. The flow rate is 1 mL min–1. The analytic column used is AcclaimTM 120 C18, 5 μm, 120 Å, 4.6 × 250 mm. For the purification of the Rox-catalyzed Rif SV degradation product, the scaled-up reactions were terminated by methanol, followed by centrifugation to precipitate the protein and evaporation to remove the solvent. The compounds were finally dissolved into methanol and directly used for the semi-preparative purification. The semi-preparative gradient condition is 0–3 min 30% B, 3–4 min 30–45% B, 4–7 min 45% B, 7–10 min 45–60% B, 10–12 min 60% B, 12–13 min 60–70% B, 13–14.5 min 70% B, 14.5–15 min 70–95% B, 15–18 min 95% B, 18–19 min 95–30% B, and 19–23 min 30% B. The flow rate is 3 mL min–1. The semi-preparative column used is YMC-Pack ODS-AQ 250 × 10.0 mmL.D., S-5 μm, 12 nm. Characterization of the Natural Product 16-Demethylsalinisporamycin The Micromonospora sp. TP-A0468 derivative strains were cultured and fermented as previously described (Zhou et al., 2019). 16-demethylsalinisporamycin was purified from the crude fermentation extracts by the silica gel column and Sephadex LH-20 column. HPLC was used to monitor the fractions during the separation process. High-Resolution ElectroSpray Ionization Mass Spectrometry analyses were performed on the Agilent 6230 Accurate-Mass TOF LC/MS System. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data were recorded on the Agilent ProPlus 500 MHz and 600 MHz NMR spectrometers.
