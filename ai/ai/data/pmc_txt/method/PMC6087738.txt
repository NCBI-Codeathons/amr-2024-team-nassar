Materials and Methods Strains and Culture Conditions Streptomyces coelicolor M145 and its redD mutant M510 (Floriano and Bibb, 1996) were used as the wild-type strain and as PdGs non-producer, respectively. R2YE (Kieser et al., 2017) agar plates were used for phenotypic characterization. Where applicable, R2YE plates were covered with cellophane membranes (GE Osmonics Labstore, Ref K01CP09030). Plates were inoculated with 500 μl of a 2 × 107 cfu/ml spore suspension. Where applicable, N-acetylglucosamine was added to a final concentration of 25 mM in R2YE plates. Complementation of the redD Mutant M510 The S. coelicolor redD mutant M510 was complemented by introducing plJ2587 harboring redD (SCO5877) with its native upstream region. A DNA fragment containing the redD upstream region (567 bp) was generated by PCR using primers (5′- GAATTCCCCCTGCTGCTCCAGGG -3′) and (5′- GGATCCCCCAATATGTTGATTTCCACGC -3′) with engineered EcoRI and BamHI sites, respectively, and cloned into pJET1.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After sequence confirmation, the fragment was retrieved through EcoRI and BamHI restriction digest, gel purified, and cloned into an EcoRI/BamHI-linearized plJ2587 (van Wezel et al., 2000) upstream of redD resulting in plasmid pELT003. The complementation construct, as well as the empty plJ2587 plasmid, were introduced into the redD mutant through intergeneric conjugation as described previously (Tenconi et al., 2015). All thiostrepton resistant colonies transformed with pELT003 (gene tsr in plJ2587) presented the intracellular red pigmentation and red fluorescence associated with PdG production confirming the complementation of the redD mutant phenotype. In situ Visualization by Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy Samples were prepared as described previously (Tenconi et al., 2013). Samples were examined under Leica TCS-SP2 and Leica TCS-SP5 confocal laser-scanning microscopes. SYTO9 and SYTOX stained samples were examined at a wavelength of 488 for excitation and 530 nm (green) for emission. Red autofluorescence of PdGs and propidium iodide-stained samples were examined at a wavelength of 543 nm (Leica TCS-SP2) or 568 nm (Leica TCS-SP5) for excitation and 630 nm (red) for emission as described previously (Tenconi et al., 2012). Quantitative analyses were performed employing the Leica LAS-AF image analysis program. Image processing and 3D reconstruction of Streptomyces filaments were performed as described previously (Tenconi et al., 2013). DNA, RNA, and Protein Extraction and Quantification Total DNA, and intracellular and extracellular RNA were extracted using the phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol protocol, mainly as described previously (Sambrook et al., 1989). The S. coelicolor mycelium (from 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 65, and 72 h cultures) was scraped with a spatula from the R2YE agar plates covered with cellophane disks, put into 2 ml tubes and frozen at -70°C. 50 mg of mycelium were first subjected to lysozyme digestion (2 mg/ml final concentration in 2 ml of extracted buffer pH8), and then incubated with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml; 1 h at 55°C) prior to nucleic acids extraction. DNA was removed from total nucleic acids extracted by using the kit Turbo DNA-free (Ambion). Proteins were extracted from 50 mg of mycelium as described previously (Tenconi et al., 2013) after sonication using 30 s pulse for 10 min (Bioruptor, Diagenode, Liège, Belgium) in 500 μl of extraction buffer. Protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm.
