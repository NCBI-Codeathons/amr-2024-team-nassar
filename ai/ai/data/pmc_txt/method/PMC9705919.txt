Materials and Methods Strains and Vectors All the strains and vectors used in this study are listed in Table 1. Bacterial Cultivation, Fermentation, and HPLC Analysis All E. coli strains were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1%NaCl) [16]. When appropriate, apramycin, kanamycin, or chloramphenicol was added to the media at a ﬁnal concentration of 50, 50, or 25 μg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, S. chattanoogensis L10 and its derivative strains were grown on yeast malt glucose (YMG) agar plates (0.4% yeast extract, 1% malt extract, 0.4% glucose, 0.2% CaCO3, and 2% agar, pH 7.2) for sporulation [17]. 1.75% glucose, 1.5% tryptone, and 1% NaCl was used as the seed broth medium, and YEME broth medium (0.3%yeast extract, 0.3% malt extract, 0.5% tryptone, and 4% glucose) was used for fermentation. In particular, the fermentation process was performed as described previously [14]. Then the production of azoxymycin was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Shimadzu LC-20AT system with a UV detector set at 400 nm with Agilent Eclipse Plus-C18 (5μm, 4.6 ×250mm2). Mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water, whereas mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The flow rate was 1 ml min-1. During the analysis procedure, mobile phase B was raised from 10 to 90% in 30 min. Moreover, S. albus ZD11, S. coeruleorubidus, and their derivative strains were grown on ISP4 agar medium (BD, USA) for 6-7 days at 30°C for sporulation. Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) medium (3% TSB) was used for pre-cultivation at 30°C for 24 h, industrial seed medium (3% soybean powder, 1% yeast extract, 4% glucose, and 0.2% CaCO3) was used for seed cultivation at 30°C for 29 h, and ionic medium (IM) with soybean oil (0.2% NaCl, 0.2% KCl, 0.5%(NH4)2SO4, 0.02% K2HPO4, 0.01% MgSO4, 0.01% CaCl2, 0.5% CaCO3, and 15% soybean oil) was used as fermentation medium [18]. The yield of salinomycin was determined as described previously [18]. To determine the production of daunorubicin, the fermentation broth was hydrolyzed by treatment with 39.2 mg of oxalic acid dihydrate per ml at 50°C for 60 min and then mixed with anhydrous methanol at the ratio of 1:9 for 12 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the supernatant was collected using a centrifuge at 12,000 ×g for 10 min and then filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. Consequently, the samples were analyzed by HPLC with a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm2, 5 um) on the Shimadzu LC-20AT system, A254 nm was measured. Additionally, mobile phase A was 10 mM ammonium acetate in water, while mobile phase B was acetonitrile. Elution was performed as follows: a linear gradient from 20 to 50% solvent B from 0 to 15 min, a linear gradient from 50 to 90% solvent B from 15 to 18 min, and 90% solvent B from 18 to 22 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1. Construction of SaindC-Based Gene Deletion System The 3.8 kb SaindC gene (Accession: EFE79871.1) was amplified by PCR from S. albidoflavus J1074 genomic DNA, while the kasOp* promoter was amplified with primer pair kas-F/kas-R from the plasmid pKC1139S-kasOp previously constructed by our lab. The nucleotide sequence of kasOp* in this plasmid was synthesized by Shanghai Generay Biotech Co., Ltd. (China) according to the previous literature [19]. Afterward, the SaindC and kasOp* promoter were inserted into the HindIII cleavage site of pSOK804 to generate pINT01. The integrative vector pINT01 containing the kasOp*-SaindC cassette and pSOK804 without the cassette was transformed into E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 and conjugated with S. chattanoogensis L10 wild-type (WT) strain. After growing on the YMG agar plates containing apramycin for 5 days, the color of the recombinants was recorded. To generate the suicide vector pSUC01, the integrase gene int phiC31 was removed from pSET152 by HindIII digestion, and then kasOp*-SaindC cassette was cloned into the HindIII cleavage site by ligation. Deletion of Four Large DNA Fragments The upstream and downstream homologous fragments of the deleting target were amplified with the primers outlined in Table S1. The length of these homologous fragments was 2 kb (for azoxymycin BGC deletion), 2.4 kb (for daunorubicin BGC deletion), 2.2 kb (for salinomycin BGC deletion), and 2.8 kb (for 200 kb non-essential chromosomal region deletion). Consequently, these homologous fragments were inserted into the pSUC01 vector using seamless cloning with the pEASY-Basic Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (TransGen Biotech, China) to generate the knockout vector pSUC02, pSUC03, pSUC04 and pSUC05. After confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, the knockout vectors were transformed into E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 and subsequently introduced into S. chattanoogensis L10 (pSUC02), S. coeruleorubidus (pSUC03), or S. albus ZD11 (pSUC04 and pSUC05) through intergeneric conjugation. The recombinants were selected by their resistance to apramycin. Several blue colonies were then transferred to the YMG or ISP4 agar plates without apramycin. Then after growth at 30°C for 4-6 days, the spores were collected and inoculated into the TSB medium. The broth was diluted appropriately and plated on YMG or ISP4 plates to form the single colonies after 2 days. Within 4-6 days of cultivation, the numbers of blue and original color colonies were recorded. To analyze the genotype of the recombinants, the original color colonies on the plates were transferred to a new plate for further growth at 30°C. Lastly, 4-6 days later, the mycelia were inoculated into TSB medium and grown at 30°C for 24 h, the genomic DNA was then extracted and used as PCR template. Bioinformatics Analysis To determine the non-essential regions on S. albus ZD11, whole genome alignment of the genome of S. albus ZD11 with other six Streptomyces strains were performed with MUMmer [20], chromosomal sequences of S. albidoflavus J1074 (CP004370.1), S. coliecolor A(3)2 (NC_003888.3), S. lividans TK24 (NZ_CP009124.1), S. clavuligerus ATCC 27064 (NZ_CP027858), S. griseus NBRC 13350 (NC_010572), and S. avermitilis MA-4680 (NC_003155) were obtained from NCBI. Moerover, in order to determine the BGCs, genomic islands (GIs), integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), and inserted sequences (ISs), computational analysis were performed using antiSMASH [21], Island viewer4 [22], and ISsaga2 [23]. The detail of the transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data of WT S.albus ZD11 mentioned in the results part was described in our previous work [18], the sequence reads obtained by RNA-seq were deposited in the SRA database under accession numbers SAMN12251778, SAMN12251779.
