Materials and Methods Materials S. venezuelae ATCC10712 was maintained as previously described [37]. Methods for cloning and protein purification are provided in the Supporting Information (Text S1 and Table S2). Modification Assay of His6-VenA with His6-VenL Analogues His6-VenA was incubated with His6-VenL, His6-VenL-ΔC, His6-VenL-ΔLC, or both His6-VenL-ΔLC and His6-VenL-ΔKC (final concentration: 2 µM each for His6-VenL and His6-VenL-ΔC, 4 µM each for His6-VenL-ΔLC and His6-VenL-ΔKC) in a reaction buffer that contained (final concentrations) 50 mM HEPES·Na buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM ATP, 1 mM TCEP, 25 µM His6-VenA, and 5% DMSO. The reactions with His6-VenL and His6-VenL-ΔC were incubated at 25°C for 3 h and the assays with His6-VenL-ΔLC or His6-VenL-ΔKC were incubated for 15 h. For mass spectrometric analysis, 10 µL of each reaction mixture was desalted using ZipTipC18 (Millipore), eluted with 1 µL of a 75% MeCN/25% water solution containing 0.1% TFA and saturated sinapinic acid, and spotted onto the target plate for analysis by using a Voyager-DE-STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). IAA Modification Assay of Modified His6-VenA After incubation of His6-VenA with His6-VenL in 20 µL of modification assay buffer, 6 µL of IAA reaction buffer (330 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5, 33 mM IAA, 6.7 mM TCEP) was added. The solution was incubated at 25°C for 15 h, desalted using ZipTipC18, and subjected to MALDI-ToF MS. LC-ESI-Q/ToF MS Analysis of Cyclized VenA Analogs After treatment of each His6-VenA analog with His6-VenL, 0.3 U of endoproteinase Glu-C (Fluka) was added to 20 µL of assay solution. The solution was further incubated at 25°C for 18 h. An aliquot of 10 µL of the resulting sample was fractionated on an Acquity UPLC (Waters) equipped with a C8 column (100 mm×1 mm) using a gradient of 3%–97% B over 12 min (A =  water containing 0.1% formic acid, B =  methanol containing 0.1% formic acid), and directly subjected to ESI-Q/ToF MS (Synapt MS system, Waters). Nitrogen was used as cone gas (150 L/min) and desolvation gas (600 L/min). The capillary voltage was set to 3.5 kV. The ionization source and desolvation gas were heated to 120°C and 300°C, respectively. The ions having m/z = 1,104.34 (trivalent ion of VenA) or 1,093.65 (trivalent ions for the VenA mutants) were fragmented with a trap collision energy of 20–40 V. The acquired spectrum was converted to a deconvoluted spectrum by using the MaxEnt3 program (Waters).
