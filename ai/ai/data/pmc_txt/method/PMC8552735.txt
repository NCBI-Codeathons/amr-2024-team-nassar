MATERIALS AND METHODS Fermentation and analysis of Streptomyces scabies RL-34, 87-22, and mutant strains. Streptomyces scabies RL-34, S. scabies 87-22, and the ΔrthB mutant were cultured in a shaking incubator at 250 rpm at 28°C for 4 days using borosilicate-baffled flasks with membrane screw caps containing 100 ml of ISP-4 medium, prepared as follows: 10 g soluble starch (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 g K2HPO4, 1 g MgSO4, 1 g NaCl, 2 g (NH4)2SO4, 2 g CaCO3, 1 mg FeSO4, 1 mg MnCl2, and 1 mg ZnSO4 were dissolved in 1 liter of deionized water. For the induction of rotihibin production, wild-type cultures were grown in the presence of 0.7% cellobiose (Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.5% glucose (Merck). Cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and 2 ml of each supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The samples were mixed with n-butanol (1:1), vortexed gently for 10 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g. The aqueous phase of the extract was dried and stored at 20°C until further use. The dried extract was dissolved in 10 mM ammonium formate (NH4FA) (pH 3) and analyzed by HPLC, monitoring the absorbance at 220 nm. The sample was eluted with solvent A (10 mM NH4FA, pH 3) and solvent B (acetonitrile [ACN]) using a 2-to-90% 7.5-min gradient at 1 ml/min on a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column (4.6 by 100 mm, 3.5 μm). Fractions were collected every 15 s, corresponding to 250 μl. The total area under the curve (AUC) for each metabolite was calculated. Student’s t test (two tailed, homoscedastic) was executed to evaluate the differential metabolite abundances between the different conditions in a statistical way. The fractions of interest were loaded into a Triverse Nanomate source (Advion) and, using 1.6 kV and 0.3 lb/in2 of pressure, electrosprayed into a Waters Synapt G1 mass spectrometer. Scans typically ranged from m/z 100 to 1,200, with a scan time of 1 s, for a total of 2 min. For MS/MS experiments, the collision energy was optimized to achieve good fragmentation spectra. Generation of the ΔrthB (scab_3221; scab_RS01465) deletion mutant in Streptomyces scabies 87-22. Deletion of the rthB gene was performed in S. scabies 87-22 using the ReDirect PCR targeting method (63) by replacing the genomic copy of the gene with an apramycin resistance cassette: using a HindIII-EcoRI restriction fragment obtained from pIJ773 (Table 6) as the PCR template, a disruption cassette, containing the resistance gene aac(3)IV and oriT for conjugative transfer, was amplified by PCR with primers BDF33 and BDF34 and gel purified as performed previously for cebR, cebE, msiK, and bglC (11, 13, 29).

Engineered restriction sites are indicated in italic and underlined, non-homologous extensions are underlined. In parallel, cosmid 2012 (cos2012), based on Supercos-1 and containing a genomic insert of S. scabies 87-22 ranging from positions 341913 to 386384, including rthB, was introduced by electroporation into Escherichia coli BW25113 carrying plasmid pIJ790 for the arabinose-inducible expression of the λ Red recombination machinery. After culture to an optical density (OD) of 0.4 with arabinose at 10 mM to induce the λ Red machinery, 50 μl of washed E. coli BW25113/pIJ790 cos2012 cells was electroporated with 100 ng (in 1 μl) of the rthB-targeting disruption cassette, and apramycin-resistant clones were selected on LB agar plates plus apramycin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). The gene replacement by the disruption cassette on the cosmid was confirmed by PCR using primers BDF35 and BDF36 (Table 6) and Sanger sequencing. The resulting cos2012Δ3221 construct was purified using a GeneJET plasmid miniprep kit (Thermo Scientific) (according to the manufacturer’s guidelines) and transferred by intergeneric conjugation with E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 (ETpUZ) as the donor strain and S. scabies 87-22 as the recipient strain. After growing ETpUZ to an OD of 0.4 (50-ml culture in LB plus chloramphenicol [30 μg/ml], apramycin [50 μg/ml], kanamycin [50 μg/ml], and ampicillin [100 μg/ml]), cells were washed to remove antibiotics and mixed with S. scabies 87-22 spores for mating. The conjugative mixture was then plated on 30-ml petri dishes of soy flour mannitol medium (SFM) (20 g/liter mannitol, 20 g/liter soy flour, and 20 g/liter agar in tap water and autoclaved twice) plus 10 mM MgCl2 and overlaid with nalidixic acid (50 μg/ml) and apramycin (40 μg/ml). Exconjugants were transferred to ISP-4 agar plates plus nalidixic acid (25 μg/ml) and apramycin (50 μg/ml) to obtain uniform mutant lines that were then used to prepare spore stocks. Each S. scabies ΔrthB mutant was checked for apramycin resistance and kanamycin sensitivity on ISP-2 agar plates. Genomic DNA was extracted from 48-h liquid cultures in tryptic soy broth (TSB) using a GenElute bacterial genomic DNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich) (according to the manufacturer’s guidelines) and used as the PCR template for mutation confirmation. Complementation of the ΔrthB deletion mutant. rthB, including its upstream (−701 bp) and downstream (+501 bp) regions, was amplified by PCR with primers BDF35 and BDF36 to obtain a 3,512-bp fragment flanked by two XbaI restriction sites. The PCR product was first cloned into a pJET1.2 vector, which was named pBDF054. Using the XbaI enzyme, rthB and surrounding regions were isolated and cloned into a pAU3-45 (64) integrative vector named pBDF043. Conjugation was performed with S. scabies ΔrthB clones 1 and 2 on SFM (plus 10 mM MgCl2) overlaid with apramycin (50 μg/ml), nalidixic acid (50 μg/ml), and thiostrepton (12.5 μg/ml). The integration of the plasmid was confirmed by PCR with primers BDF69 and BDF70. Structural confirmation by NMR spectroscopy. Both rotihibin analogues were dissolved in 0.6 ml of DMSO-d6, and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded at 25°C on a Bruker Avance II 700-MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm Prodigy TCI N2 cooled cryoprobe. Total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra were recorded using the standard pulse sequences from the Bruker library. Protein extraction and sample preparation. S. scabies RL-34 cells were cultivated in three different growth media (ISP-4 medium, ISP-4 medium supplemented with 0.7% cellobiose, and ISP-4 medium supplemented with 0.5% glucose) for 96 h (28°C at 250 rpm), with three biological replicates under each condition. The cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was washed two times and resuspended in 10 ml lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail). The homogeneous mycelium suspension was sonicated (20 times with 30 s on and 30 s off at 30%) on ice using a Branson digital sonifier 450 cell disruptor. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Pellets were discarded, and the supernatant was subjected to trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. The crude intracellular extract was mixed with a 100% (wt/vol) TCA solution (Sigma-Aldrich) (4:1) and incubated overnight. This mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the protein pellet was washed two times with ice-cold acetone and solubilized in 2 M urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The protein concentration was determined using the Pierce Coomassie protein assay kit. Protein extracts (10 μg) were spiked with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (MS-grade protein standard) (0.2 ng/μl) as an internal standard. The proteins were subsequently reduced with 2.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (10 min at 60°C), alkylated with 7.5 mM iodoacetamide (20 min at room temperature), and trypsinized (1/50) (overnight at 37°C). The reaction was stopped with 1% HCOOH. After centrifugation (30 min at 13,200 rpm), the samples were filtered with a prewashed 0.22-μm Costar filter and transferred to clean tubes. Targeted proteomic analysis. The resulting peptide solutions were injected (0.1 μg) onto an ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) M-Class system where the peptides were trapped for 5 min, at 15 μl/min, on a 300-μm by 50-mm, 5-μm, 100-Å Acquity UPLC M-Class symmetry C18 trap column (Waters) and separated on the iKey separation device (150 μm by 100 mm, 1.8 μm) (HSS T3; Waters) with solvent A (0.1% HCOOH in H2O [Biosolve]) and solvent B (0.1% HCOOH in ACN [Biosolve]) using a 20-min gradient of 3 to 50% solvent B at a flow rate of 1 μl/min. The strong and weak solutions used to wash the autosampler were 0.1% HCOOH in H2O and 0.1% HCOOH in acetonitrile-water-isopropanol (50:25:25, vol/vol/vol), respectively. The separated peptides were introduced into the IonKey source coupled to a Waters Xevo TQ-S triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer for quantification of the analytes in the positive-ion mode (ESI+). The ESI-MS/MS parameters were as follows: capillary voltage of 3.6 kV, cone voltage of 40 V, source temperature of 120°C, and collision gas argon flow rate of 0.19 ml/min. The transitions of the selected precursor ions were detected in MRM mode at different collision energies specific for each precursor (Table 7). Data were acquired using MassLynx 4.1 software and processed in Skyline 3.7. The transition curves were subjected to Savitsky-Golay smoothing, and their area under the curve (AUC) was determined and normalized to the spiked BSA standard. Student’s t test (two tailed, homoscedastic) was executed to evaluate the differential protein abundances between the different conditions in a statistical way.

The sequence of the biosynthetic rotihibin gene cluster was further analyzed and annotated using UniProt and BLAST (65, 66). Similar gene clusters were identified in other Actinomycetes strains by PATRIC 3.5.21 analysis (31). A phylogenetic tree was calculated, from the rthA MUSCLE sequence alignment, using the neighbor-joining method with MEGA-X (67). Thaxtomin synthetase A (txtA) was selected as the outgroup. The module/domain organization of the different NRPSs in the rotihibin gene cluster was predicted via PRISM (68, 69). The A-domain specificity was predicted via four different software tools: the LSI-based A-domain function predictor, NRPSsp, the PKS/NRPS Web server, and SEQL-NRPS. The LSI-based predictor uses latent semantic indexing to predict adenylation domain specificities (70). NRPSsp uses hits against hidden Markov model (HMM) databases to predict specificities of NRPS adenylation domains (71). The PKS/NRPS Web server uses BLAST to detect catalytic domains in NRPS and predicts A-domain specificities by comparing signatures of A domains with those of known substrates (72). Finally, SEQL-NRPS predicts A-domain specificities using the discriminative classification method sequence learner (SEQL) (73). Lemna minor L. and Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh. bioassay. A sterile 24-well plate was used to grow Lemna minor (duckweed) in 2 ml mineral medium [11.1 mg CaCl2, 202 mg KNO3, 49.6 mg MgSO4·7H2O, 50.3 mg KH2PO4, 27.8 mg K2HPO4, 6 mg FeSO4·7H2O, 17.4 mg K2SO4, 5.72 mg H3BO3, 2.82 mg MnCl2·4H2O, 0.6 mg ZnSO4, 10 mg Na2-EDTA, 0.008 mg CuCl2·H2O, 0.054 mg CoCl2·6H2O, and 0.043 mg (NH4)6Mo7O24 dissolved in 1 liter of MilliQ (MQ) water (pH 6.5 ± 0.1)] (74). The plants were incubated in quadruple for 4 days in a growth chamber (16-h light exposure at 22°C). In order to assess the sensitivity of L. minor to rotihibins C and D, a wide concentration range (0.17 to 84.4 μM for rotihibin C and 0.3 to 157.6 μM for rotihibin D) was tested. After 4 days of incubation, the plates were analyzed based on the growth and maximal photochemistry efficiency of photosystem II via chlorophyll fluorescence (FV/FM) of the duckweed plants. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 pregerminated seeds were transferred to petri dishes with half-strength Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium without sucrose (0.22% MS salts and 0.8% plant agar) (75). Nine days after germination, the plants were treated with rotihibins C and D dissolved in water (0.005 to 0.1 mM) via nebulization on the leaves. After 4 days of treatment, the plates were analyzed based on the growth and FV/FM values of the Arabidopsis plants. Imaging was achieved with an in-house-developed phenotyping platform, in an environment-controlled growth chamber, property of the Ghent University Laboratory of Applied Mycology and Phenomics. The platform allows visualization of diverse physiological traits via a multispectral 3CCD camera equipped with 12 interference filters in real time, based on specific absorption, reflection, and emission patterns, such as leaf surface, efficiency of photosynthesis, chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged organisms. This platform is equipped with a dispenser, which can be fitted with a nozzle to treat the plants with rotihibins or other agrochemicals in a standardized manner. Image data processing was performed using Data Analysis (version 5.4.6; Phenovation, Wageningen, Netherlands), and statistical analysis was performed in RStudio (version 1.1.383) (76) using R (version 4.0.5) (77) for Welch’s t test and Tukey’s post hoc test. Visualization of the data was done using the ggplot2 package (78). Data availability. The MRM data have been deposited in PeptideAtlas (79) with the data set identifier PASS01674.
