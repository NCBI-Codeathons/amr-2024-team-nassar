MATERIALS AND METHODS Bioinformatic analysis. The putative Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris relA and spoT sequences identified in a previous report of the RelA/SpoT superfamily (16) were retrieved from the X. campestris pv. campestris 8004 genome database (NCBI). Functional domains within RelA and SpoT were identified using the InterPro online tool (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/). Amino acid sequences of both the RelA and SpoT hydrolase domains were used as a query to search the X. campestris pv. campestris 8004 genome for other (p)ppGpp hydrolase homologs. For comparative analysis of hydrolase domains (HDs) in SAHs from different organisms, amino acid sequences were retrieved from NCBI and analyzed using Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) and Jalview (51). Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in (Table 5, and primers are listed in Table 6. X. campestris pv. campestris 8004 (52) and its isogenic derivatives were cultured at 28°C with shaking (250 rpm) in LB broth (5 g/liter yeast extract, 10 g/liter NaCl, and 10 g/liter tryptone), or defined medium supplemented with amino acids (MOPS EZ defined medium [Teknova] containing all amino acids, 0.2% glucose replaced by 0.2% glutamate, and without 10× ACGU [a solution of adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil]). Escherichia coli strains were cultured in LB broth at 37°C with shaking (250 rpm). When required, solid medium was prepared by the addition of 15 g/liter agar, and selective antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: rifampin, 50 μg/mL; kanamycin, 50 μg/mL; chloramphenicol, 20 μg/mL; carbenicillin, 100 μg/mL; and tetracycline, 5 μg/mL for X. campestris pv. campestris and 15 μg/mL for E. coli.

Underlined nucleotides indicate the location of restriction sites used for cloning (restriction enzymes are shown in parentheses). The X. campestris pv. campestris Δsah mutant was generated using the triparental mating method. Fragments 500 bp upstream and downstream of the sah gene were amplified using primers oJW4314/oJW4315 and oJW4316/oJW4317, respectively. The resulting PCR products were ligated with primers oJW4318/oJW4319 using the In-Fusion method, followed by EcoRI/HindIII digestion and ligation into p2P24Km vector (53) to generate the donor vector p2P24Km-sah. Triparental mating was conducted using E. coli donors containing p2P24Km-sah with an E. coli helper strain containing pRK600 (54) to transform X. campestris pv. campestris 8004 (WT), followed by double selection with rifampin and kanamycin. Xanthomonad-like colonies (yellow in color) were picked and verified by PCR using X. campestris pv. campestris-specific primers DLH120/DLH125 (55) and X. campestris pv. campestris sah-specific primers oJW3991/oJW3992. Complementation of X. campestris pv. campestris strains ectopically expressing sah in the Δsah background were also generated by triparental mating. The full-length sah gene including the native promoter was amplified using the oJW4030/oJW4031 primer set and cloned into the pLAFR3 (56) vector to generate the plasmid pLAFR3-sah. Triparental mating was conducted using E. coli donors containing pLAFR3-sah with an E. coli helper strain containing pRK600 (54) to transform X. campestris pv. campestris Δsah, followed by double selection with rifampin and tetracycline. To generate pLIC-sah for expression and purification of XccSAH protein, the sah coding sequence was amplified by PCR using primers oJW3946/oJW394 and cloned into pLICtrPC-HA (a His tag overexpression vector) using ligation-independent cloning (57, 58). The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Expression and purification of XccSAH and C. elegans Mesh1. His-tagged XccSAH or C. elegans Mesh1 was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the expression plasmid pLIC-sah or pLIC-Mesh1, respectively. Cells were grown in LB with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin at 28°C overnight, diluted 1:50 in fresh LB with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin, and grown at 37°C with shaking to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of ~0.7. Expression was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37°C for 4 h. Cells were pelleted at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and stored at −80°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4 [pH 8], 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 20 mg/mL lysozyme [Sigma]) and treated with benzonase endonuclease (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min on ice. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g 4°C for 15 min to collect the supernatant. The supernatant was loaded into a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column (Qiagen) by centrifugation at 850 × g at 4°C for 5 min, followed by washing twice with wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4 [pH 8], 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole). Protein was eluted with 600 μL elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4 [pH 8], 300 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole) and dialyzed twice with dialysis buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], and 10% glycerol [vol/vol]) at 4°C. The purified protein was concentrated and analyzed using SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). In vitro synthesis of (p)ppGpp, pGpp and pppApp. pppGpp was synthesized from 8 mM ATP and 6 mM GTP using RelSeq1-385 (59) in a buffer containing 25 mM bis-Tris propane (pH 9.0), 15 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM DTT at 37°C for 6 h. For production of [5′-α-32P]pppGpp, [α-32P]GTP was used instead of nonradiolabeled GTP. ppGpp and pGpp were synthesized from pppGpp using GppA (59) and NahA (12), respectively, as described previously (59). pppApp was kindly shared by Boyuan Wang and Michael Laub. [5′-γ-32P, 3′-β-32P]pppApp synthesis was performed by incubating [γ-32P]ATP with 10 μM Staphylococcus aureus SasA (29) in 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.5) at 37°C overnight. The synthesis reaction was quenched using 2.4 volumes of CHCl3 followed by incubation at 95°C for 15 s. Purification of nucleotides was performed using anion-exchange column (HiTrap QFF 1 mL; GE Healthcare) using a gradient of buffer A (0.1 mM LiCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 25 mM Tris-HCL; pH 7.5) and buffer B (1 M LiCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 25 mM Tris-HCL; pH 7.5). Purity of synthesized nucleotides was determined by spotting on polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose TLC plates (Millipore) and resolved in 1.5 M KH2PO4 at pH 3.4. TLC plates were exposed on storage phosphor screens (GE Healthcare) and scanned on a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare). Alarmone hydrolysis assay. Hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp, pGpp, and pppApp was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), ~0.3 nM 32P-radiolabeled nucleotide (pGpp, ppGpp, pppGpp, or pppApp), 1 mM MnCl2, and 240 nM purified hydrolases (B. subtilis Rel, B. subtilis RelR44Q [a hydrolase-defective variant], or XccSAH) at 37°C. To compare the effect of magnesium versus manganese on hydrolysis, 1 mM MnCl2 was replaced with 10 mM MgCl2. At indicated times, 10 μL of reaction mixture was added to 2 μL of 2 M formic acid to quench the reaction. Two microliters of the quenched sample was spotted on PEI-cellulose TLC plates (Millipore) and resolved in 1.5 M KH2PO4 (pH 3.4) buffer. TLC plates were dried and exposed on storage phosphor screens (GE Healthcare) and scanned on a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare). Identities of the hydrolysis products were verified with nucleotide standards run in parallel or by using high-performance LC-MS. For kinetic assays of alarmone hydrolysis by XccSAH, the reaction mixture contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM MnCl2, 50 nM XccSAH, ~0.1 nM 32P-radiolabeled nucleotide, and the indicated concentrations of corresponding nonradioactive nucleotide. In the case of pppApp hydrolysis, XccSAH was used at 25 nM. The reaction was carried out at 37°C, and 10 μL of the reaction mixture was removed at 0 min, 0.5 min, 1 min, 1.5 min, and 2 min into 2 μL of 2 M formic acid to quench the reaction. Two microliters of the quenched sample was subjected to thin-layer chromatography. The levels of substrate and product were quantified using a Typhoon imager. Km, Vmax, and kcat were determined by fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism 7 (GraphPad). NADPH hydrolysis assay. To determine the products of NADPH hydrolysis by XccSAH, 100 μM NADPH was incubated with or without 1 μM XccSAH in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) with 1 mM MnCl2 for 60 min at 37°C. The reaction was quenched with 0.5 M formic acid and diluted 10-fold with HPLC-grade H2O. The diluted reaction mixture was subjected to HPLC-MS analysis as described previously (12, 25). Kinetics of NADPH hydrolysis by XccSAH were determined by measuring the rate of phosphate release using the malachite green phosphate assay kit (Sigma). The hydrolysis reaction was carried out at 37°C in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM NADPH, and different concentrations of XccSAH. As a positive control, purified C. elegans Mesh1 was used at 0.5 μM. For kinetic assays, reactions were carried out at 37°C in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mM MnCl2, 1 μM XccSAH, and increasing concentrations of NADPH. At indicated times, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was diluted into freshly prepared working reagent, mix gently, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Color development was measured by absorbance at 620 nm using the Synergy2 microplate reader (Biotek); concentration of released free phosphate was determined from the standard curve prepared as described in the manufacturer’s manual. Hydrolysis kinetics were determined by fitting the rate of phosphate release to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism 7 (GraphPad). Metabolite extraction and detection using HPLC-tandem MS. For detection of metabolites during amino acid starvation, fresh colonies of X. campestris pv. campestris wild type, Δsah mutant, and Δsah::Psah complementation strain were inoculated into 5 mL LB broth and incubated at 28°C with shaking (200 rpm) overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended at an OD600 of ≈0.3 in M9 broth (30 g/liter Na2HPO4, 15 g/liter KH2PO4, 2.5 g/liter NaCl, 5 g/liter NH4Cl, 2 mM MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 0.2% glucose) containing 0.5 mg/mL serine hydroxamate (Sigma). Cultures were harvested at 0 min and 30 min after resuspension. Ten-milliliter cultures were filtered through a 0.45-μm polytetrafluoroethylene membrane (Sartorius) and then immediately transferred to 3 mL of prechilled 50:50 (vol/vol) chloroform-water, followed by vortexing to quench metabolism and to extract soluble metabolites. The cell extracts were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove the organic phase, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cell debris. The resulting supernatants were analyzed immediately using HPLC-MS as described previously (12, 25). For detection of metabolites during growth in minimal media, fresh colonies of X. campestris pv. campestris wild type, Δsah mutant, and Δsah::Psah complementation strain were inoculated into 25 mL MOPS EZ defined medium (Teknova) without 10× ACGU and with 0.2% glucose replaced by 0.2% glutamate. Cultures were incubated at 28°C with shaking (200 rpm) to reach an OD600 of ≈0.2. Twenty-milliliter cultures were harvested for metabolite extraction and detection using HPLC-MS (12, 25). Metabolomic data analysis was performed using the Metabolomics Analysis and Visualization Engine (MAVEN) software (60). Ion counts of metabolites were normalized by the OD600 and unit volume of the culture. Estimation of cellular NADP(H) and NAD(H) concentrations was done as described previously (25) with the detection efficiency of NADPH in LC-MS set as 3.02e7 ion counts/μM in a 25-μL sample, as well as an estimated X. campestris pv. campestris cell volume of 2.377 fL. Bacterial growth measurement. For growth measurement, fresh colonies of X. campestris pv. campestris wild type, Δsah, and Δsah::Psah strains on LB agar were resuspended into growth media and diluted to an OD600 of ≈0.005 in 96-well plates. Growth was monitored by the OD600 at 28°C under shaking in a Synergy2 microplate reader (BioTek). Doubling times were estimated by fitting the growth data to the exponential growth curve using a custom python script. For counting CFU, X. campestris pv. campestris cultures were serially diluted and plated on LB agar. Colonies were counted after incubation at 28°C for 2 to 4 days. Plant pathogenicity assay. Pathogenicity of X. campestris pv. campestris wild type and Δsah mutant was assessed by infection on radish (Raphanus sativus L. cv. Japan 501) leaves. Twenty-microliter aliquots of cell suspensions (OD600, 0.3) were injected into the main vein on the backs of leaves of radish seedlings at the 5-true-leaf stage. A negative control was prepared by injecting an equivalent volume of sterile 0.85% NaCl. Symptoms of disease were evaluated at 7 days postinoculation (dpi). For reisolation of bacteria from infected leaves, 3 leaf disks (9 mm) were collected from each inoculated leaf using a hole puncher. The leaf disks were disinfected by immersion in 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solution for 1 min, washed twice using sterilized water, and snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were then homogenized using a Retsch MM400 ball-milling machine at 60 Hz for 1 min. The resulting leaf powder was resuspended in 0.85% NaCl followed by serial dilution and plating on LB agar. The plates were incubated at 28°C for 2 days followed by colony counting. Biofilm and exopolysaccharide assay. Biofilm production by X. campestris pv. campestris was measured using the crystal violet method adapted for Xanthomonas (61). Fresh X. campestris pv. campestris colonies were inoculated into LB at an OD600 of 1 and incubated at 28°C without shaking to promote biofilm growth. After a 5-day incubation, nonadherent cells and culture media were removed by decanting. The adherent biofilm was stained with 0.1% (wt/vol) crystal violet solution for 30 min, then washed twice with sterilized water. The biofilm-bound crystal violet was solubilized in absolute ethanol and quantified by absorbance at 600 nm. EPS production by X. campestris pv. campestris strains was measured using LB agar containing 2% glucose, as described previously (62). Two-microliter aliquots of X. campestris pv. campestris cell suspensions (OD600, 0.3) were patched onto LB-glucose plates and incubated at 28°C for 4 days. EPS production was observed by comparing the mucoidiness of the patches and the diameters of colonies. X. campestris pv. campestris soil survival assay. Survival of X. campestris pv. campestris in the field was conducted in soil sampled from a vegetable patch planted with Chinese cabbage in 5 consecutive years. Overnight culture of wild type and Δsah (OD600, 0.3) was inoculated into 5 g unsterilized soil for each time point (0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 days). To recover X. campestris pv. campestris from soil, the X. campestris pv. campestris-inoculated soil was added into a 250-mL flask with 30 mL 0.85% NaCl under shaking for 30 min and then the suspension was filtered by 4-layer cheese cloth. The filtered suspension was serially diluted and plated on selective mCS20ABN media (63) containing 2 g/liter soya peptone, 2 g/liter Bacto tryptone, 1.59 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.33 g/liter (NH4)2HPO4, 0.4 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 6 g/liter l-glutamine, 1 mL/liter 0.75% methyl green (adjusted to pH 6.5 with NaOH), 12.5 g/liter soluble starch, and 15 g/liter Bacto agar) with 50 μg/mL rifampin. The plates were incubated at 28°C for 2 days followed by colony counting to enumerate the X. campestris pv. campestris titer in the soil. Interspecies competition assay. To measure survival of X. campestris pv. campestris against Pseudomonas, 1 mL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA01 or Pseudomonas sp. strain ADAK18 (45) in LB (OD600, 2.0) was mixed with 100 μL of X. campestris pv. campestris (WT, Δsah, or Δsah::Psah) (OD600, 1.0). Aliquots of 10 μL of each competition mixture were patched on 3% LB agar plates in triplicate and incubated face up at 28°C for 24 h. At 0 h and 24h, the competition spots were excised from the agar plate and fully resuspended in LB, followed by serial dilution and plating on X. campestris pv. campestris-selective plates (LB agar containing 50 μg/mL rifampin and 5 μg/mL tetracycline). The plates were incubated at 28°C for 2 days followed by colony counting.
