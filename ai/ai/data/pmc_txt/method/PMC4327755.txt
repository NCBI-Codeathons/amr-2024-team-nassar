Materials and methods Bacterial isolates The experimental material consisted of purified twenty-four isolates of P. putida isolated from soil samples of different geographical locations of Chhattisgarh as listed in Table 1. Both rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric soil samples were collected and used for isolation of fluorescent pseudomonads by adopting serial dilution method in King’s B medium. After incubation at 28 °C for 2 days, fluorescent pseudomonad colonies from plates were identified under UV light (366 nm). Isolates were characterized on the basis of biochemical tests as per the procedures outlined in Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (Sneath et al. 1986). Purified single colonies were further streaked onto KB agar plates to obtain pure cultures. The isolates were maintained in the culture collections of the Department of Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India. Bacterial cultures were maintained at −80 °C on King’s B broth (Himedia) containing 50 % (w/v) glycerol and revived on King’s B slants as per requirement.Table 1Pseudomonas putida isolates used in the present studyS. no.IsolatesOrigin/location1P2Cowpea soil, IGKV Horticulture garden, Raipur2P3Fallow land soil, IGKV Horticulture garden, Raipur3P7Fenugreek soil, IGKV Horticulture, Raipur4P23Termitorium soil, VIP Road, Raipur5P29Termitorium soil, VIP Road, Raipur6P43Abhanpur road7P45Abhanpur road8P56Bhatagaon9P59Bhatagaon (degraded paddy straw)10P74Chhati11P80Darba12P123Kanker forest-213P130Kanker forest-314P132Kanker forest-315P144Rice field, Kodebor16P150Kurud17P163Nursery, Raipur18P166Purur19P174Rice field, Rajiv Gandhi Marg, Raipur20P184Arhar-rice field soil, Satpara21P187Arhar-rice field soil, Satpara22P191Forest soil, Raipur23P192Forest soil, Raipur24P207Bamboo soil, VIP road, Raipur Pseudomonas putida isolates used in the present study S. no.

Phenotypic characterization of P. putida isolates The phenotypic characterization of P. putida isolates were done on the basis of fluorescence on King’s B (KB) medium, gelatin liquefaction, casein hydrolysis, lipolytic activity, nitrate reduction, growth at 4 and 42 °C, oxidase test, phenylalanine test and egg yolk medium test (Stanier et al. 1966; Holt et al. 1994). A rapid antibiotic sensitivity test was used to distinguish different species of fluorescent Pseudomonas. Antibiotic sensitivity studies were performed by the streak plate method of Bauer et al. (1966). Kanamycin and carbenicillin sensitivity was determined by incorporating 1 mg/ml of Kanamycin and 0.1 mg/ml of Carbenicillin, respectively, in King’s B medium. Pseudomonas spp. showing positive growth on either of the antibiotic supplemented medium was resistant. Hicarbohydrate™ kit was used to test carbon utilization profiles as described by the manufacturer (Himedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). Cells were grown in King’s medium B broth to reach density of 0.5 O.D. at 600 nm. An aliquot of 50 μl of this suspension was inoculated to each well of Hicarbohydrate™ kit, incubated at 30 °C for 24 h and the results were registered according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The experiment was done with three replicates. Screening for polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production and its quantitative estimation Pseudomonas putida isolates were screened for PHB accumulation qualitatively by following the viable colony method using Sudan Black B dye (Juan et al. 1998). Sterilized Nutrient agar (Himedia) supplemented with 1 % glucose was spot inoculated with the isolates and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Ethanolic solution (0.02 %) of Sudan Black B was spread over the colony and the plates were kept undisturbed for 30 min. Later, they were washed with ethanol (96 %) to remove the excess stain from the colony. The dark blue colored colony was taken as positive for PHB production. The Sudan Black B positive isolates were subjected to quantification of PHB production as per the method of John and Ralph (1961). The bacterial cells containing the polymer were pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. and the pellet was washed with acetone and ethanol to remove the unwanted materials. The pellet was resuspended in equal volume of 4 % sodium hypochlorite and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The whole mixture was again centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The cell pellet containing PHB was again washed with acetone and ethanol. Finally, the polymer granules were dissolved in hot chloroform. The chloroform was filtered and to the filtrate, concentrated 10 ml hot H2SO4 was added. The addition of sulfuric acid converts the polymer into crotonic acid which is brown colored. The solution was cooled and the absorbance read at 235 nm against a sulfuric acid blank. By referring to the standard curve prepared using Poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid] (Sigma Aldrich, USA) by following the method of Law and Slepecky (1969), the quantity of PHB produced by different bacterial isolates was determined. Screening of phosphate solubilisation ability and its quantitative estimation Qualitative screening of phosphate solubilising P. putida was performed on Pikovskaya agar medium (Himedia) containing tricalcium phosphate as a phosphate source and bromocresol purple (0.1 g/l) as a pH indicator for acidification (Vazquez et al. 2000). After incubation of fresh cultures of P. putida at 28 ± 2 °C for 48 h, phosphate solubilising isolates turned the media color from purple to yellow in the zones of acidification. Quantitative estimation of phosphate solubilisation in Pikovskaya broth (Himedia) was performed according to the procedure of Murphy and Riley (1962). Fresh cultures of P. putida isolates were inoculated to 50 ml of Pikovskaya’s broth and incubated at 28 ± 2 °C and 100 rpm. The amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) released in the broth was estimated after 7 days of incubation in comparison with un-inoculated control. The broth culture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to separate the supernatant from the bacterial growth and insoluble phosphate. To the 0.5 ml of the culture supernatant 5 ml of chloromolybdic acid was added and mixed thoroughly. Volume was made up to 10 ml with distilled water and 125 μl of chlorostannous acid was added to it. Immediately, the final volume was made up to 25 ml with distilled water and mixed thoroughly. After 15 min, the blue color developed was read in a spectrophotometer at 610 nm using a reagent blank. Corresponding amount of soluble phosphorous was calculated from standard curve of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4). Phosphate solubilizing activity was expressed in terms of tricalcium phosphate solubilization which in turn was measured by μg/ml of available orthophosphate as calibrated from the standard curve of KH2PO4. 16S rRNA gene amplification Total genomic DNA from 24 P. putida isolates was extracted by the CTAB procedure (Ausubel et al. 1991) and used for amplification using various primers (Table 2). PCR primers designed from genes HI660468 (Pa49), HM067869 (Pa16S), HQ317190 (Pp16S), EF159157 (Pf16S) and AF869903 (Pf23S) were used to specifically distinguish species of Pseudomonas isolates by amplification of the nuclear rRNA gene cluster. These forward and reverse primers were designed using Batch primer3 software from following gene sequences: HI660468: Sequence 49 from Patent WO2010127969 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, HM067869 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain GIM 32 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence, HQ317190 of P. putida strain DYJL49 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence, EF159157 of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain TNAUA2 16S ribosomal RNA gene and 16S–23S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer, partial sequence and AF369903 of Pseudomonas fluorescens 23S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence procured from NCBI database. PCR was carried in 20 μl reaction mixture containing 1× assay buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl at pH 9.0, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2), 0.1 mM each dNTP mix, 1 μM both forward and reverse primers, 60–90 ng of template DNA and 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Axygen) in a programmable thermo cycler (M/s Biorad Laboratories India Pvt. Ltd) according to the following thermo-cycling conditions: 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min and final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min.Table 2Details of PCR primers used in the present studyS. no.PrimersGene/referenceSequence(5′–3′)LengthExpected product size (bp)1Pa49-FHI660468TCTTCCGCCTGTTCAATTACCCGA24448Pa49-RAATACCTTGGCCACCTTGTTCAGC242Pa16S-FHM067869AGAGGGTGGTGGAATTTCCTGTGT24586Pa16s-RTACCGACCATTGTAGCACGTGTGT243Pp16S-FHQ317190ACCGACAGAATAAGCACCGGCTAA24364Pp16S-RAAGAGTTCAAGACTCCCAACGGCT244Pf16S-FEF159157TCCCTATCGATTGATCCGGCTTCT24250–260Pf16S-RTTTAGATGGTGGAGCCAAGGAGGA245Pf23S-FAF869903ACGCTTTCTTTAAAGGGTGGCTGC24400–420Pf23S-RTCTATCCATGGGCAGGTTGAAGGT246ERIC-Fde Bruijn (1992)AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGAGCG22ERIC-RTATAAGCTCCTGGGGATTCAC217PhaJ1-FPolyhydroxyalkanoateAAGGCCGAGTACAAGAAGTCCGTT24240–250PhaJ1-RTCACCGGTTTCTGGAAGCTCATCT248PHZ1PhenazineGGCGACATGGTCAACGG171,400PHZ2Delaney et al.

ERIC-PCR-based genotypic analysis ERIC primer sequences were used in PCR to detect differences in the number and distribution of these bacterial repetitive sequences in the bacterial genome. ERIC-PCR was carried out using the primer sequences ERIC-F (5′AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGAGCG3′) and ERIC-R (5′TATAAGCTCCTGGGGATTCAC3′) as described by de Bruijn (1992). ERIC-PCR was carried in 20 μl reaction mixture containing 1× assay buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl at pH 9.0, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2), 0.1 mM each dNTP mix, 1 μM both forward and reverse primers, 60–90 ng of template DNA and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Axygen) in a programmable thermo cycler (M/s Biorad Laboratories India Pvt. Ltd) according to the following thermo-cycling conditions: 94 °C for 3 min, 45 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 53 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min and final elongation step at 72 °C for 8 min. In vitro detection of antibiotic-producing P. putida isolates using gene-specific primers Primers (Imperial Life Sciences) for the different PCR-based screening of genes that encode for antibiotics are detailed in Table 2. Preparation of bacterial templates for detecting antibiotic-producing genes was carried out as described by Wang et al. (2001) and Rezzonico et al. (2003). PCR amplification of primers PhaJ1F-R, PHZ1-2, PCA2a-3B, B2BF-BPR4, PrnAF-R, phlA-1f-r, plt1-2, PrnCf-r, Phl2a-2b and PltBf-r was carried out in 20 μl reaction mixtures containing 3 μl of lysed bacterial suspension, 1X assay buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl at pH 9.0, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1 μM of each primer and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Axygen). Amplification was performed in a programmable thermo cycler (M/s Biorad Laboratories India Pvt. Ltd). The cycling program for PCA2a-3B, PrnAF-R, plt1-2, PrnCf-r, PHZ1-2, Phl2a-2b, PhaJ1F-R, and PltBf-r included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 62 °C (for PCA2a-3B, PrnAF-R, plt1-2, PrnCf-r, PHZ1-2)/52 °C (for Plt1-2)/60 °C (for Phl2a-2b, PhaJ1F-R)/65 °C (for B2BF-BPR4) for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and then a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. However, the cycling program for phlA-1f-r included an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and then a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplification products were electrophoresed in a 1 % (w/v) agarose gel with 1× TBE buffer at 80 V at room temperature, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light by Biorad Gel-Documentation as well as on 5 % native polyacrylamide gel (visualized by silver staining). Statistical analysis All the experiments were conducted in three completely randomized replicates. On the basis of data derived from the carbon source utilization profiles, a matrix with binary code composing positive (1) and negative (0) values was made. SIMQUAL program was used to compute the symmetric matrix in the form of average taxonomic distances. Sequential, agglomerative, hierarchical and nested (SAHN) clustering was used for the cluster analyses. Phenogram was constructed from the similarity matrix by the un-weighted pair group with mathematical averages (UPGMA) using NTSYS-pc2.02a (Exeter software, New York, USA) numerical taxonomy and multivariate analysis system. Similar method was followed to construct dendrogram using binary data of ERIC primer-based PCR amplification of P. putida isolates. Replicated data of quantitative estimation of PHB production and P solubilization of all the 24 P. putida isolates were subjected to statistical analysis using WASP (Web Agri Stat Package) software (http://icargoa.res.in/wasp/index.php). Critical difference at 0.05 level of significance was calculated for the observed values along with average and standard deviation. Duncan’s test controls the Type I comparison wise error rate and as per Duncan’s grouping mean values with the same letter are not significantly different.
