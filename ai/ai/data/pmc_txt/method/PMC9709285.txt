2 Materials and methods 2.1 Isolation and identification 2.1.1 Sample collection and endophyte isolation Healthy R. roxburghii tissues (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds) were collected from April to August 2020 in Guizhou Province (27°4′50″ N, 106°29′50″ E and 25°52′52″ N, 104°33′59″ E), China. Endophytic fungi were isolated from different tissue parts using a surface sterilization method (Wang et al., 2019). The main steps of the procedure: Tissue segments were surface-sterilized with 75% ethanol for 1 min, rinsed thrice with sterile water, immersed in 1% (w/v) aqueous sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 1–3 minutes (roots, 2 min; stems and seeds, 3min; and leaves, fruits, and flowers, 1 min), and washed thrice again with sterile distilled water. Six different media were used for fungal isolation, namely, potato dextrose agar (PDA), oatmeal agar (OA), malt extract agar (MEA), Czapek Dox agar (CDA), water agar (WA), and synthetic low nutrient agar (SNA). The media were supplemented with streptomycin sulphate (0.5 g/L) to avoid bacterial contamination. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of surface sterilization was examined according to the previous description (Singh et al., 2017; Rojas et al., 2020). All pure isolates were stored at -80°C with 30% glycerol. 2.1.2 Molecular identification DNA was extracted from mycelia grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for a Fungal gDNA Isolation Kit (BW-GD2416, Biomiga, China). The primers used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing included ITS5/ITS4 for ITS (White et al., 1990), LR0R/LR5 for LSU (Vilgalys and Hester, 1990), Bt2a/Bt2b for TUB (Glass and Donaldson, 1995), and fRPB2-5F/fRPB2-7cR for RPB2 (Liu et al., 1999). Successful amplification is generally obtained by annealing at 55°C for 35 cycles. The PCR products were sequenced by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). Endophytic fungi were identified based on multigene phylogenetic analyses. Consensus sequences were edited with BioEdit v. 7.0.9.0 (Hall, 1999). Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT v. 7 (Katoh et al., 2019), manually adjusted in BioEdit, and concatenated in PhyloSuite v. 1.2.2 (Zhang et al., 2020). Phylogenetic analyses were inferred from maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). ModelFinder determined the substitution models based on the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017). BIC was used for ML analyses, while AIC was used for BI analyses. ML tree inference was constructed using 10,000 ultrafast bootstraps (Minh et al., 2013) under the edge-linked partition model implemented in IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2014). BI analyses were carried out in MrBayes 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al., 2012) under the partition models, with two independent runs of four chains that were run for five million generations using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Finally, the resulting trees were visualized using Figtree v.1.4.3 (Rambaut, 2014). 2.2 Antimicrobial activity 2.2.1 Tested strains To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi, the following microorganisms were used: Six tested fungi, including kiwifruit soft rot pathogens Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Botryosphaeria dothidea, pepper anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum capsici, rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae, rice sheath blight fungus Rhizoctonia solani, and root rot fungus Fusarium oxysporum (causing Pseudostellaria heterophylla and Zanthoxylum schinifolium diseases). Six tested bacteria, namely kiwifruit bacterial canker pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae; peach bacterial shot hole pathogen Pantoea agglomerans; other bacteria Bacillus subtilis CMCC (B) 63501, Escherichia coli CMCC (B) 44102, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. 2.2.2 Preliminary screening of antimicrobial activity assay Endophytic strains with antagonistic ability were screened out by the plate confrontation method (Gao et al., 2021). The width of the zone of inhibition (I) between tested fungi (or bacteria) and endophytes was determined according to the previously described method (Gao et al., 2021). The definition of the inhibition intensity is based on the previously described method (Gashgari et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2019). The intensity is divided into four levels, which are indicated by 0, 1, 2, and 3 for no inhibition, weak inhibition, moderate inhibition, and strong inhibition, respectively. For evaluating antifungal activity: 0 (I = 0 mm), 1 (0 mm < I ≤ 1 mm), 2 (1 mm < I ≤ 3 mm), and 3 (I > 3 mm); for antibacterial activity: 0 (I ≤ 1 mm), 1 (1 mm < I ≤ 2 mm), 2 (2 mm < I ≤ 10 mm), and 3 (I > 10 mm). Through phylogenetic analyses and preliminary screening, strains were selected for re-screening antimicrobial activity under the following principles: with the best inhibition effect in the same species and strong inhibition of at least one or moderate inhibition of three or more against the tested strains. 2.2.3 Secondary metabolites extraction To further investigate the antimicrobial activity of the initially screened-out strains, crude extracts of the secondary metabolites were prepared using the method described previously (Zhang et al., 2021b). The endophytic strains were fermented in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 100 mL potato dextrose broth (PDB) (potato: 200 g/L, glucose: 20 g/L, and natural pH) at 28 ± 1°C, 220 rpm, and for 7–10 d. High-speed centrifugation (14,000 g, 10 min) was performed to separate the culture broth and mycelium, which were extracted by ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and methanol (MeOH)-assisted sonication, respectively. Then concentrated at 50°C under reduced pressure until constant weight and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain 20 mg/mL of EtOAc crude extract (extracellular metabolites) and MeOH crude extract (intracellular metabolites). 2.2.4 Re-screening of antimicrobial activity assay The extracellular and intracellular metabolites were re-screened for antimicrobial activity using the disc diffusion method (Hu et al., 2017; Rjeibi et al., 2020). For antifungal assay: Briefly, a tested fungal plug (6 mm diam.) and a same-sized sterile filter paper disc were placed at the appropriate position of the PDA plate (90 mm diam.). The disc was impregnated with 10 μL of metabolite (20 mg/mL). DMSO was used as a negative control. All plates were incubated at 28 ± 1°C. The radial growth of the tested strains was measured after 2–7 d. Negative control plates as R
1 and experimental plates containing metabolites as R
2. The percentage inhibition (%) = (R
1-R
2)/R
1 × 100% (Hajieghrari et al., 2008). For antibacterial assay: The sterile disc (6 mm diam.) was placed at the center of the nutrient agar (NA) plate, which had been coated with tested bacteria, and then impregnated with 10 μL of extracellular or intracellular metabolite (20 mg/mL). Equal volumes of DMSO were used as a negative control. The diameters of the inhibition zone (d) were measured after culturing for 24–48 hours at 25°C ± 1°C for phytopathogenic bacteria and 35°C ± 1°C for other tested bacteria. Similarly, the MICs were determined. The assays were repeated three times. 2.3 Morphological observations Morphological characteristics were observed on PDA. In this study, the final screened-out strain with antimicrobial potential was inoculated on PDA, cultured at 28°C for 5–7 days, and then placed at 4°C for preservation to promote sporulation. Macroscopic morphology was examined under a digital microscope (VHX-7000, Keyence). After sporulation, micromorphological features and dimensions of the spores were determined in 25% lactic acid under a Zeiss Axiolab 5 light microscope equipped with an Axiocam 208 camera. 2.4 Genome-sequencing, annotation, and analyses Strain with the strongest antimicrobial activity from the re-screening was selected for whole-genome sequencing to deeply analyze its biosynthetic capacity. Genomic DNA was sequenced using a combination of second-generation Illumina sequencing technologies and third-generation PacBio sequencing technology at Guangzhou Genedenovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The endophytic strain was grown in a 1  L Erlenmeyer flask containing 500  mL of PDB at 28°C under 220  rpm for three days. The fermentation broth was centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was discarded, and the mycelium was collected and used for genomic DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted using commercial kits, and DNA quality was assayed using Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Qualified genomic DNA was fragmented with G-tubes (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) and end-repaired to prepare SMRTbell DNA template libraries with a fragment size of >10 Kb. Then, library quality was detected by Qubit® 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA), and average fragment size was estimated on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Subsequently, SMRT sequencing was performed on the Pacific Biosciences Sequel sequencer (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA) following standard protocols (MagBead Standard Seq v2 loading, 1 × 180 min movie) with the P4-C2 chemistry. Continuous long reads attained from SMRT sequencing were corrected for random errors in the long seed reads (seed length threshold 6 Kb) by aligning shorter reads from the same library using MECAT. The resulting corrected, preassembled reads were used for de novo assembly using MECAT with an overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) strategy (Myers et al., 2000; Xiao et al., 2017). The Open reading frame (ORF) was predicted using the GeneMark-ES (Ter-Hovhannisyan et al., 2008). Repetitive elements were identified by RepeatMasker (Chen, 2004). Noncoding RNAs, such as rRNAs prediction, were carried out using RNAmmer (Lagesen et al., 2007), and tRNAs were identified by tRNA-scan-SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997). Functional annotation of predicted protein-coding genes against National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant Protein (Nr) database, Gene Ontology (GO), eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and SwissProt databases were conducted by the BlastP method. Moreover, the assembled genome sequence was analyzed for secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) using antiSMASH 6.1.1. 2.5 Non-targeted metabolomics analyses The PDB fermentation conditions for endophytic fungi were identical to the genomic sequencing assay. The fermentation broth of the endophyte was separated by high-speed centrifugation (14,000 g, 10 min). We selected extracellular or intracellular metabolites with better inhibitory activity for non-target metabolomics analyses based on the results of the re-screening assay. The culture broth samples were thawed at 4°C, and 100 μL aliquots were mixed with 400 μL of cold methanol/acetonitrile/H2O (2:2:1, v/v/v). Following vortex mixing, low-temperature sonication for 30 min and resting for 10 min at -20°C. After that, the mixture was centrifuged for 20 min (14,000 g, 4°C). The supernatant was dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The samples were re-dissolved in 100 μL acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) for LC-MS analyses. Analyses were performed using a UHPLC (1290 Infinity LC, Agilent Technologies) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight (AB Sciex Triple TOF 6600). The chromatographic separation and The ESI source conditions were as previously described (Huang et al., 2019). 2.6 Comparative genomics analyses Relevant genomic data released by NCBI were selected for comparative genomic profiling. Three de novo gene prediction programs, Augustus v.2.7, GeneMark+ES v.4.0, and SNAP v.2013-02-16, were used to predict the protein-coding regions if only genomic data were available in NCBI. The Maximum likelihood tree of genomes was performed using single-copy orthologous genes. Pathogen-host interaction (PHI), carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and BGCs were annotated using PHI-base v. 4.13, dbCAN2 v. 11, and antiSMASH v. 6.1.1, respectively. Genes encoding BGCs were aligned using MAFFT v. 7, the substitution model was determined by ModelFinder, and ML tree inference was performed in IQ-TREE using 10,000 ultrafast bootstraps. Finally, the annotation results of each genome were compared and analyzed. 2.7 Data analysis Data were analyzed by ANOVA, followed by comparisons of means using the LSD test in Data Processing System (DPS v9.50) (P < 0.05).
