4.2. General Experimental Procedures NMR spectra of PAPA were acquired in D2O using a Bruker AVANCE III-600 spectrometer (Bruker Corp., Germany) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. HR-ESI-MS data were recorded using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II/6545 QTOF LC/MS instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), with an Agilent TC C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm). The purification of PAPA was carried on Agilent 1290 Infinity II/1292 Prep FC instrument with an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 column (9.4 × 250 mm, 5 μm). Column chromatography separation for dnacin B1 detection was carried on MCI gel CHP20/P120 (Mitsubishi, Tokyo, Japan).
