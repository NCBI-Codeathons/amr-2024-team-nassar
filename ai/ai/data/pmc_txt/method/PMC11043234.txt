Culture of S. peucetius in shake flasks S. peucetius was cultured in SP slant medium (Maltodextrin, 2.0%; yeast extract, 1.5%; enzymatic hydrolysis of casein, 0.5%; glucose, 0.4%; Soy peptone, 0.25%; KH2PO4, 0.15%; CaCO3, 0.2%; agar, 2.0%; pH 7.2) at 28 °C for 4–6 days, after which the strain (approximately 1.0 cm × 1.5 cm mycelia) was picked and inoculated into a 250 mL shake flask containing 25 mL of seed medium (corn starch, 0.5%; glucose, 0.5%; soybean flour, 3.0%; dry yeast powder, 0.1%; NaCl, 0.1%; KH2PO4, 0.1%; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1%; pH 7.2) and subsequently grown at 28 °C for 40–46 h. Afterward, 2 mL of the seed culture was transferred to a 250 mL shake flask containing 25 mL of fermentation medium (soybean oil, 8.0%; soybean meal, 3.0%; NaCl, 0.2%; CaCO3, 0.3%; pH 6.2). Fermentation shake flasks were incubated at 28 °C in a rotatory shaker for 6 days. Culture of S. Peucetius in a 10 L fermenter The 1.0 cm × 1.5 cm mycelia of the engineered S. peucetius △U1/drrC were picked and cultured in a seed medium at 28 ℃ for 42–48 h at 200 rpm. 5% seed cultures were transferred to a 10 L bioreactor containing 6 L of fermentation medium. The incubation temperature, initial pH and aeration conditions were 28 ℃, 6.2 and 0.03–0.06 vvm (air volume/culture volume/min), respectively. The dissolved oxygen was automatically associated with agitation, which was controlled at 30-35% during fermentation. The yield of doxorubicin was measured at regular intervals for 8 days. Screening of S. peucetius with doxorubicin resistance The S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 cultured on the plate were inoculated into a seed medium containing 50 mg/L doxorubicin at 28 ℃ and 220 rpm for 2 days. The seed culture mixture was continuously transferred to fresh seed medium 2 times, diluted on a solid plate to obtain single colonies, and cultured for doxorubicin production in shake flasks. The strain with the highest yield of doxorubicin was selected for the next round of screening. The concentration of doxorubicin in the seed medium was gradually increased from 50 mg/L to 100 mg/L and 150 mg/L to obtain doxorubicin-resistant strains. Intergeneric conjugal transfer of plasmid from E. Coli to S. Peucetius S. peucetius stored in 20% glycerol at -80 °C was spread onto SP plates and cultured in an incubator at 28 °C for 4–6 days. Mycelia (1.0 cm × 1.5 cm) were picked and inoculated into seed media for 2 days, after which 10% of the inoculum was transferred to tryptic soy broth (TSB) media for culture for 20–24 h. E. coli S17-1 was cultured overnight at 37 °C in 5 mL LB tubes, after which 2% of the inoculum was cultured in 50 mL LB shake flasks. When the OD of E. coli reached 0.4–0.6, mixed cultures of Streptomyces and E. coli were incubated in RP media (soluble starch, 2.0%; soybean powder, 1.0%; valine, 0.05%; NaCl, 0.2%; KH2PO4, 0.05%; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1%; MgCl2.6H2O, 1.6%; agar, 2.0%; CaCO3, 0.3%). The plates were incubated at 28 °C for 18–20 h and overlaid with 1 mL of sterile water containing 150 mg/L nalidixic acid and 200 mg/L apramycin. These plates were further incubated in a 28 °C incubator for 5–7 days, after which apramycin-resistant colonies were picked for PCR validation. Strain construction The knockout strains △U1, △H4 and △X1 were derived from SIPI-7-14 with the deletion of a 351 bp, 783 bp and 1221 bp fragment on the gene dnrU, dnrH and dnrX, respectively. The constructed △U1 knockout mutant strain was used as an example. The S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 genome was used as a template to obtain the 1121 bp upstream and 1450 bp downstream homology arms of dnrU by PCR amplification with the primers dnrU-UP-F/R and dnrU-DOWN-F/R. The upstream and downstream homology arms were fused together by overlapping PCR with the primers dnrU-UP-F/dnrU-DOWN-R. The PCR product was digested with HindIII/XbaI and then assembled on the pSET vector to construct the plasmid pSET-△dnrU (Additional file: Fig. S2a), which was used to delete the dnrU gene. The well-established plasmid was subsequently transformed into S17-1, which was subsequently conjugated with strain SIPI-7-14. The colonies that were apramycin resistant were regarded as the integrating mutants, in which the first homologous single-crossover occurred. The resulting mutants were then subcultured six times in TSB medium without the antibiotic apramycin and diluted to spread on SP plates. The colonies that were phenotypically sensitive to apramycin were selected. The primers ΔdnrU F/R were used for colony PCR verification. The PCR products were subsequently sequenced by GENEWIZ for verification, and all primers were synthesized by Jie Li Biology (Li et al. 2022). The mutant strains ΔH4 and ΔX1 were constructed using the same method as that used to construct ΔU1. Among them, the two homology arms of the mutant strains △H4 and △X1 were obtained from the SIPI-7-14 genome using the primer pairs dnrH-up-F/R and dnrH-down-F/R and dnrX-up-F/R and dnrX-down-F/R, respectively. The constructed plasmids pSET-△dnrH and pSET-△dnrX were shown in Additional file: Fig. S2b and Fig. S2c. The final verification PCR primers used were ΔdnrH F/R and ΔdnrX F/R. The PCR products of the △dnrH and △dnrX genes were validated by further Sanger sequencing. To overexpress the drrC gene, the drrC gene fragment was first obtained from the S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 genome by PCR using the primers drrC F/R. The plasmid pSET152 was subsequently digested with NdeI and ligated to the PCR product to construct the integrated plasmid pSET152-drrC (Additional file: Fig. S2d). The correctly sequenced plasmid was introduced into S17-1 competent cells. The drrC gene was subsequently integrated into S. peucetius △U1 by conjugative transfer. The plasmids pSET152-drrAB (Additional file: Fig. S2e) and pSET152-drrD (Additional file: Fig. S2f) were constructed in the same way. The drrAB and drrD genes were obtained by PCR amplification using the primers drrAB F/R and drrD F/R, respectively. The target gene drrAB was amplified from the S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 genome using the primers drrAB F (TY)/R. The plasmid pSET152-drrC was subsequently digested with speI and ligated to the PCR product to construct the integrated plasmid pSET152-drrABC (Additional file: Fig. S2g). The genetically engineered strains containing the overexpressed genes were cultured in shake flasks, and the yield of doxorubicin was analyzed using HPLC. Genes with accession numbers were as follow: drrA (Accession number: PP049447), drrB (Accession number: PP049448), drrC (Accession number: L76359) and drrD (Accession number: PP049449). Optimization of fermentation medium by RSM The fermentation medium was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) using the statistical design software Box‒Behnken design (BBD), version 8.06. Three factors, (A) maltodextrin, (B) dry yeast powder, and (C) calcium chloride, were used, and all the variables consisted of three levels (-1, 0, and 1), representing minimum, intermediate, and maximum values, respectively (as shown in Additional file: Table S2). The seeds were cultured for 40–46 h. The engineered strain △U1/drrC was selected for fermentation in shake flasks. 10% of the seeds cultured for 40–46 h were transferred to fermentation media for 6 days. Each experiment was repeated in three parallel shake flasks. The fermentation yield of doxorubicin was measured by HPLC. Analysis of cell growth and doxorubicin production For biomass determination, 4 mL of fermentation broth was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. Biomass (%) = [(F − S)/F] × 100%, where F represents the volume of fermentation broth and S represents the volume of supernatant. The fermentation broth was adjusted to pH 1.5–1.8 with 6 mol/L HCl, and 0.1 mL of the fermentation broth was subsequently added to 0.9 mL of ethanol, mixed and sonicated for 30 min at 4 Hz. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane, after which the samples were detected via Agilent 1260 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chromatographic column used was an Agilent SB-18 (3.5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm), the mobile phase was used at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, the detection wavelength was 254 nm, and the column temperature was 30 ℃. The mobile phase was composed of buffer: acetonitrile: methanol = 500:500:60, where the buffer contained 0.68 mL of phosphoric acid and 1.44 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate in 500 mL of purified water. Analysis of transcriptional levels by quantitative real-time PCR For the control strain S. peucetius ΔU1 and the overexpression strain ΔU1/drrC, 20 mL of fermentation broth was collected on the 4th and 6th days, respectively, and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to collect the cells. Total RNA was extracted according to the experimental manual provided with the Ultrapure RNA Kit (CWBIO, Beijing, China). Before reverse transcription of the RNA into cDNA, residual DNA in the RNA samples was removed using RNase-free DNase I (Takara, Dalian, China). Reverse transcription was performed using the Kit PrimeScript™ RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) according to the method provided by the kit manufacturer. The obtained cDNA was used as a template for qPCR, and the transcription level of the drrC gene was determined with the 16S rRNA gene as the reference gene. The primers used for qPCR amplification of the drrC gene and 16S rRNA gene were QdrrC F/R and 16 S RNA F/R, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S1). The qPCR amplification conditions included 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s; and a final step of 95 °C for 15 s. Changes in the fold change in gene expression levels were quantified using the 2− ρρCt method (Livak and Schmittgen 2001). Each qRT‒PCR experiment was repeated three times. Statistical analysis Each experiment in this study had been replicated three times, with the error bars showing the standard deviations. Statistical analyses involving comparison between the test data and the control date were performed with t-student test (P < 0.001) and one-way ANOVA by using GraphPad Prism Version 8.0 software and Origin Version 8.5 software.
