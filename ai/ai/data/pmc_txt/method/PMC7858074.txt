MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacteria, plasmids, and growth conditions. The bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are described in Table S1. General chemical and molecular biology reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or New England Biolabs. Phosphinothricin (glufosinate) was purchased from GoldBio (CAS no. 77182-82-2). Standard bacterial growth media were prepared as described (67–69). E. coli strains were typically grown at 37°C; P. ananatis strains were typically grown at 30°C. Phosphonate induction media (PIM) was prepared as follows: 8.37 g/liter MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid), 0.72 g/liter Tricine, 0.58 g/liter NaCl, 0.51 g/liter NH4Cl, 1.6 g/liter KOH, 0.1 g/liter MgCl2·6H2O, 0.05 g/liter K2SO4, and 0.2 g/liter K2HPO4 were dissolved in H2O and steam sterilized for 20 min at 121°C. After cooling, 1× sterile trace element solution was added [1,000× stock: 1.5 g/liter nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt, 0.8 g/liter Fe(NH4)2 (SO4)2·7H2O, 0.2 g/liter Na2SeO3, 0.1 g/liter CoCl2·6H2O, 0.1 g/liter MnSO4·H2O, 0.1 g/liter Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.1 g/liter Na2WO4·2H2O, 0.1 g/liter ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g/liter NiCl2·6H2O, 0.01 g/liter H3BO3, 0.01 g/liter CuSO4·5H2O] followed by addition of 1% (vol/vol) sterile glycerol and 50 μg/ml sterile kanamycin. For culturing of Candida and Saccharomyces strains, RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich R6504) was used for liquid culturing, and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA; Difco 210950) was used for solid plating unless otherwise specified. For Aspergillus strains, RPMI 1640 medium was used for liquid culturing, and potato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco 213400) was used for solid plating unless otherwise specified. YMM medium (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids [BD Difco 291940], 20 g/liter glucose, 1× trace element solution) was used as minimal medium for fungal strains.

P. ananatis genomes were downloaded from the NCBI database, and a hidden Markov model (HMM) search was performed using HMMER v3.2.1 (70). The HMMs used for analysis were phosphoenolpyruvate phosphomutase (pepM, TIGR02320), phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phnX, TIGR01422), phosphonoacetate hydrolase (phnA, TIGR02335), 2-AEP transaminase (phnW, TIGR02326 and TIGR03301), phosphonopyruvate hydrolase (palA, TIGR02321), phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (phnY, TIGR03250), HD-phosphohydrolase (phnZ, TIGR00277 and PF01966), and C-P lyase (phnJ, PF06007). Genomes with an HMM match were considered to have the associated metabolism. Genomes containing pepM were screened for the presence of the hvr locus by mapping them to the P. ananatis LMG 5342 gene cluster using Geneious Prime v2020.2.1 software. For pepM genes that did not correspond to the hvr operon, gene cluster boundaries around the pepM were deduced based on the presence of either flanking integrative and conjugative elements or genes that appeared to be in an operon together with pepM. BLASTP was used to assign functions to genes in the gene cluster based on homology to proteins of known function. Genome sequencing of Pantoea NRRL strains. The genomes of strains P. ananatis NRRL B-14773 and P. ananatis B-133 (since renamed P. stewartii based on NCBI average nucleotide identity analyses) were sequenced for use in this study. High-molecular-weight genomic DNA was purified using a Qiagen DNeasy UltraClean microbial kit. Purified genomic DNA was prepared using Shotgun Flex DNA library prep and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq v2 platform (250-nucleotide [nt] paired-end reads) by the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Sequencing Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Genome reads were trimmed using BBDuk software, assembled using SPAdes v3.14.1, and annotated using the RAST server (71, 72). Assembled reads were submitted to the NCBI whole-genome shotgun (WGS) database. This WGS project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession numbers JACETZ000000000 (for P. stewartii NRRL B-133) and JACEUA000000000 (for P. ananatis NRRL B-14773). The genomes were analyzed for phosphonate metabolism as described above. Genetic methods for making unmarked deletion mutations. Approximately 1 kb of DNA upstream and downstream of the region to be deleted was cloned into pHC001A (see Table S2 for the complete list of plasmid constructs). The resulting plasmids were introduced into electrocompetent E. coli DH5α/λpir and maintained in LB medium + 50 μg/ml kanamycin (LB-Kan). Plasmid constructs were moved into the conjugation strain WM6026 via electroporation-mediated transformation and then transferred to P. ananatis recipients via conjugation. Conjugations were performed by streaking isolated colonies of donor and recipient together in small (2 cm by 2 cm) patches on agar-solidified LB medium containing 60 μM diaminopimelic acid (DAP) to allow growth of WM6026-derived donor strains, which are DAP auxotrophs. After overnight incubation at 30°C, the patches were picked and restreaked on LB-Kan without added DAP to select for P. ananatis recombinants that carry the deletion plasmids, which cannot replicate autonomously in P. ananatis, and inserted into the target locus by homologous recombination. Exconjugants were purified by streaking for isolated colonies on LB-Kan at 30°C and then by streaking on LB without antibiotics to allow for segregation of the integrated plasmid. Recombinants that had lost the integrated plasmid were then isolated by streaking on LB medium without NaCl containing 5% sucrose, which selects against the sacB gene encoded on the integrated deletion plasmid. Loss of the integrated plasmid was verified by showing that the purified recombinants were kanamycin sensitive. Finally, recombinants carrying the desired deletion were identified by PCR-based screening using primers described in Table S3. Introduction of IPTG-inducible Ptac system. Plasmid construct, pAP01, was introduced into WM6026 by electroporation with selection on LB + 50 μg/ml kanamycin (LB-Kan). The plasmid was then transferred to P. ananatis MMG1988 as described in the preceding section. Recombinants that carry an integrated copy of pAP01 inserted into the hvrA gene were selected on LB-Kan. The resulting colonies were screened for the plasmid integration using primers for aph and lacIq as well as the Hvr-marker gene hvrI (see Table S1 for the primer list). The resulting strain, P. ananatis MMG2010, was maintained in LB-Kan to prevent loss of the integrated plasmid. NMR and MS. The 1HNMR, 13C-NMR, and 31P-NMR spectra were recorded on an Agilent DD2 600 MHz spectrometer (600 MHz for 1H, 150 MHz for 13C, and 243 MHz for 31P). Samples were prepared in 20 to 100% D2O as the locking solvent. Quantitative 31P-NMR was performed using an internal standard of 0.5 mM dimethylphosphinate with addition of 0.9 mM EDTA, and acquisition was performed using 5× the T1 measurement (relaxation time) for the sample. Phosphonate peak integrals were calculated using MestReNova v11.0.1 software and normalized to the internal standard. Concentrations were calculated based on the ratio of the normalized phosphonate peak integrals to the known concentration of internal standard. Mass spectrometry (MS) was performed by the School of Chemical Sciences Mass Spectrometry Laboratory using a Waters Q-TOF Ultima electrospray ionization (ESI) instrument in which 10 μl of sample was injected at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in methanol. IPTG-induced expression of the hvr operon in P. ananatis MMG2010. A frozen glycerol stock of P. ananatis MMG2010 was revived on LB + 50 μg/ml kanamycin and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. A single colony was then transferred to 5 ml of phosphonate induction medium (PIM). The culture was incubated at 30°C for 48 h, and then 0.5 ml of culture was transferred to 50 ml PIM and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. The next day, 8 ml of culture was transferred to each of four flasks containing 800 ml PIM medium plus 1 mM IPTG. These 800-ml cultures were incubated with shaking at 175 rpm at 30°C for 72 h. After growth, cultures were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 20 min to remove cells and debris, and the supernatant was concentrated by freeze-drying. Quantitative 31P-NMR analysis was performed on the concentrated supernatant aliquot to determine phosphonate production levels after adding dimethylphosphinate (0.5 mM final) as an internal standard. Purification of pantaphos and compound 2. A 3.2-liter culture of P. ananatis MMG2010 was grown in PIM medium with 1 mM IPTG as described in the preceding section. After centrifugation to remove cells, the spent medium was freeze-dried, and the dried material was resuspended in 300 ml H2O. Then, 1,200 ml of 100% cold methanol was added for a final concentration of 75% methanol and incubated at –20°C overnight. Precipitated material was removed and saved using vacuum filtration with a Whatman grade 42 ashless filter, and the methanol-soluble fraction was dried to completion using initial rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying. The 48.0 g of dried material obtained by this process (sample A) was saved for further purification. The precipitated material saved from the above-described methanol extraction was subjected to a secondary 75% methanol extraction as described. Then the methanol-soluble fraction was dried to completion using initial rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying. The 1.60 g of dried material obtained by this process (sample B) was saved for further purification. Sample A was subjected to Fe3+-IMAC purification as follows: 10 g of Chelex resin (sodium form) was converted to the H+ form by incubation in 1 M HCl for 30 min, followed by washing with 5 column volumes (CV) of water. Next, the resin was charged with Fe+3 by resuspension in 100 ml of 300-mM FeCl3·6H2O for 1 h at 4°C followed by washing with 100 ml of 0.1% acetic acid and incubation in 100 ml of 0.1% acetic acid overnight at 4°C. Sample A was acidified using concentrated acetic acid to pH 3 and incubated with the Fe-IMAC resin at 4°C for 2 h. The solution was separated from the resin using a gravity column, and the flowthrough containing unbound phosphonic acids was saved (sample-flowthrough). Bound phosphonic acids were eluted from the Fe-IMAC resin using a gradient of 100 ml NH4HCO3 (1, 5, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 mM), and fractions were collected and neutralized to neutral pH using acetic acid. The eight fractions were concentrated using initial rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying. Sample-flowthrough, containing any unbound phosphonic acids, obtained from the above-described process was combined with sample B and subjected to a second round of Fe-IMAC purification as described above. Fractions were concentrated using initial rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying. From each of the Fe-IMAC purifications, the fractions were combined in 2 to 3 ml H2O as follows: the 500 to 1,000 mM NH4HCO3 fractions (sample 1), the 1 to 5 mM NH4HCO3 fractions (sample 2), and the 25 to 50, 100, or 250 mM NH4HCO3 fractions (sample 3). Samples 1, 2, and 3 were separately concentrated and dried via freeze-drying to obtain 45.1 mg, 30.6 mg, and 6.9 mg of dried material, respectively. Quantitative phosphorus NMR, based on a 0.5-mM dimethylphosphinate standard reference, and purity assessment using proton NMR were performed for each sample. Samples 1 and 3 contained 0.551 mmol and 0.215 mmol phosphonate, respectively. However, sample 2 was found to contain only 0.0165 mmol phosphonate and included residual phosphates not present in samples 1 and 3 and, therefore, was not used for further purification steps. Sample 1 was subjected to further purification using a Teledyne ISCO CombiFlash RF+ UV-Vis system using a RediSep SAX anion exchange resin. Sample 1 was lyophilized and then reconstituted in 75% methanol. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of 100% D2O, and examined by 31P-NMR. Samples containing residual phosphonates were subjected to additional cycles of drying and 75% methanol until all phosphonate compounds were solubilized. The methanol-soluble fractions were then pooled and subjected to CombiFlash purification. To do this, 5.7 g RediSep SAX column was equilibrated with 20 column volumes (CV) of 5% NH4OH in H2O, followed by 20 CV of H2O and then 20 CV of 90% methanol. A 1-ml sample from the methanol-soluble fractions was loaded onto the column via direct injection followed by 3.3 min 100% A (90% methanol), linear gradient to 100% B (5% NH4OH in H2O) over 15 min then 100% B for 6 min, followed by 3.5 min 100% A at an 18-ml/min flow rate. Fractions were monitored using UV 250 nm and 210 nm, and fractions showing absorbance at either wavelength were combined and analyzed by 31P-NMR. Fractions containing the δP 18 and 15 ppm phosphorus chemical shifts were saved and dried via rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying. Sample 3 and the Combiflash-purified sample 1 were then subjected separately to high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification. Dried samples were reconstituted in 1 ml H2O, and then 50 to 100 μl of sample was diluted in solvent B (90% acetonitrile + 10 mM NH4HCO3 at pH 9.20) for a final concentration of 75% solvent B. Samples were then filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and purified using Atlantis HILIC Silica column (10 × 250 mm2, 5 μm particle size) using gradient elution. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 4 ml/min using H2O + 10 mM NH4HCO3 at pH 8.50 (solvent A) and 90% acetonitrile + 10 mM NH4CO3 at pH 9.20 (solvent B). The gradient performed was as follows: 8 min at 90% solvent B, followed by a linear gradient to 70% solvent B over 20 min, then 50% solvent B over 1 min, hold at 50% solvent B over 8 min, and then back to 90% solvent B over 1 min, followed by hold at 90% solvent B for 8 min. Fractions were collected and monitored for UV absorption at 210 and 250 nm. Fractions that absorbed at these wavelengths were combined and dried via rotary evaporation and analyzed using phosphorus NMR. Fractions were obtained that contained a pure phosphonate compound with a δP 15 ppm chemical shift (corresponding to pantaphos), and fractions were obtained containing a purified phosphonate compound with a δP 18 ppm chemical shift (corresponding to compound 2). Additional fractions were obtained that contained a mixture of pantaphos and compound 2. Purified compounds were dried and saved at 4°C for MS and NMR structural analyses as described above. Onion bioactivity assays. Yellow onions purchased form the local market were surface sterilized in a laminar flow biosafety hood as follows. First, the outermost layers with any damage or browning were removed and discarded, followed by soaking for 10 min in 10% bleach. The onions were then rinsed three times with sterile distilled water (dH2O), followed by soaking in 70% ethanol (EtOH) for an additional 10 min, and then rinsed four times with sterile dH2O. The onions were left in a biosafety laminar flow hood until the water and ethanol were completely evaporated. For testing the virulence of microbial strains, the onions were inoculated by stabbing with a previously sterilized wooden toothpick dipped into a bacterial cell suspension (1 × 103 CFU/ml in 1× phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] buffer). Chemical complementation studies were performed by the addition of 100 μl of filter-sterilized sample into the hole created by the toothpick during inoculation. For testing the bioactivity of crude and purified chemical samples in the absence of bacteria, holes were punched in sterilized onions using sterile toothpicks followed by addition of 100 μl of a filter-sterilized sample. Following inoculation and/or treatment with filter-sterilized compounds, the onions were placed in Ziplock plastic bags and incubated at 30°C in the dark for the indicated number of days. Following incubation, the onions were sectioned across the site of inoculation/sample application to allow visual inspection of the center rot phenotype. Mustard seedling bioactivity testing. All seed preparation was performed in a laminar flow biosafety hood. Burpee tendergreen mustard seeds were cleaned as follows: 10% bleach for 1 min, 3× rinse with sterile dH2O, 70% ethanol for 1 min, followed by 5× rinse with sterile dH2O. Washed seeds were transferred to a sterilized paper towel and placed inside a sterile container. Then, 5 ml of sterile tap water was added to the paper towel, and the container was incubated in the dark for 48 h to allow the seeds to germinate. Germinated seedlings were transferred to 24-well cell culture plates containing 1 ml of Murashige and Skoog agar (1% agar) per well. Then, 20 μl of an appropriate dilution of the filter-sterilized compounds being tested were added to each well to achieve the desired concentration. For negative controls, 20 μl of sterile dH2O was spotted onto the agar. The 24-well plates were incubated in a humidity-controlled growth room with a 16 h light cycle at 23°C for 1 week. Following incubation, plants were extracted from the growth agar by gentle pulling, which resulted in essentially agar free plants. Root length was measured immediately; dry weight was determined after drying for 24 h at 150°C. Statistical analysis was performed for each condition to determine significance using the standard Welch’s t test analysis from GraphPad Prism v8.4.1 software. Cell culture cytotoxicity screening. The compounds were evaluated for their ability to kill cancer cell lines in culture, using HOS (osteosarcoma), ES-2 (ovarian cancer), HCT 116 (colon cancer), A549 (lung carcinoma), and A172 (glioma) cells. Human skin fibroblast cells (HFF-1) were also assessed. Cells were seeded (3,000 cells well−1 for ES-2, HCT 116, A549, and A172; 4,000 cells well−1 for HFF-1 and 2,500 cells well−1 for HOS) in a 96-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were treated with pantaphos in water. The concentrations of the tested compounds were 5 nM to 100 μM (1% water final; 100 μl well−1). Raptinal (50 μM) was used as a dead control. On each plate, five technical replicates per compound were performed. Then, 72 h posttreatment, cell viability was assessed using the alamarBlue method (http://www.bio-rad-antibodies.com/measuring-cytotoxicity-proliferation-spectrophotometry-fluorescence-alamarBlue.html). alamarBlue solution (10 μl of 440-μM resazurin in sterile 1× PBS) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 3 to 4 h. Conversion of alamarBlue was measured with a plate reader (SpectraMax M3; Molecular Devices) by fluorescence (excitation wavelength, 555 nm; emission wavelength, 585 nm; cutoff, 570 nm; autogain). The percentage death was determined by normalizing to water-treated cells and Raptinal-treated cells. For IC50 determination, the data were plotted as compound concentration versus dead cell percentage and fitted to a logistic dose-response curve using OriginPro 2019 (OriginLab). The data were generated in triplicate, and IC50 values are reported as the average of three separate experiments along with standard error of the mean SEM values. Antibacterial bioassays. Susceptibility testing for the ESKAPE pathogens and Salmonella enterica LT2 was performed using a Kirby-Bauer method as outlined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (73). For rich medium bioassays, Mueller-Hinton broth 2 (MH-2; Sigma-Aldrich; 90922) was used for all strains except that 1% brain heart infusion (BHI) was supplemented for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433. For minimal medium bioassays, glucose-MOPS minimal medium was used. Briefly, overnight bacterial cultures were subcultured and inoculated into 5 ml top agar (0.7% agar) for a final concentration of 5 × 105 CFU/ml. Then, 20 μl of a compound 2-fold dilution series (200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 μM in water) was spotted on 6-mm diameter blank paper discs (BD BBL; 231039). Control discs received 20 μl of 50 mg/ml kanamycin. Plates were incubated at 35°C for 20 to 24 h. The MIC was recorded as the lowest concentration of compound that resulted in a clear zone of inhibition around the disc. Sensitivity of the IPTG-inducible phosphonate uptake strain WM6242 to pantaphos was tested using a disk diffusion assay. Plates containing growth medium were overlaid with 5 ml of top agar (0.7% agar) inoculated with 100 μl (optical density at 600 nm [OD600] of 0.8) of the phosphonate-specific E. coli indicator strain (WM6242) with or without addition of 1 mM IPTG. WM6242 is engineered with an IPTG-inducible, nonspecific phosphonate uptake system (phnCDE). After the seeded overlay solidified, 6-mm paper disks were spotted with 10 μl of a dilution series (200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 μM in water) of pantaphos and applied to the plates, which were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Phosphonate-specific activity was queried by comparing the sensitivity to that of 200 μM kanamycin and 200 μM fosfomycin. The MIC was recorded as the lowest concentration of compound that resulted in a clear zone of inhibition around the disc. Fungicidal bioassays. Methods for fungicide testing were adopted from the CLSI publication M27, Reference Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of Yeasts (74). Briefly, a –80°C fungal stock was streaked on the appropriate medium as indicated previously and incubated at 35°C for 24 to 48 h. For Candida and Saccharomyces, a single colony was picked and resuspended in 1 ml 1× PBS and then diluted in growth medium to a final concentration of 1 × 104 CFU/ml. For Aspergillus, spores from the hyphal growth on the growth medium plate were resuspended by swirling 1 ml of 90% saline + 0.1% Tween 20 onto the lawn. This 1-ml yeast suspension was then diluted in growth medium to a 1 × 104 CFU/ml final concentration. Then, 2 μl of compound was added to 198 μl of the yeast suspension in a sterile 96-well round-bottom plate. For positive controls, 2 μl of a stock solution of amphotericin B was added to a final concentration of 2 or 10 μM as specified. Then, 200 μl of untreated yeast suspension and an uninoculated medium were included as controls. The plate was incubated at 35°C for 24 to 48 h depending on the growth medium without shaking. The MIC was determined visually by finding the concentration of compound at which there was no visual difference between that concentration and the uninoculated media control. Identification and analysis of homologous Hvr biosynthetic gene clusters in bacteria. NCBI tblastn was used to identify bacterial genomes that contain Hvr-like gene clusters. The query was constructed by concatenating the gene translations of hvrA to hvrL. Tblastn was used against the RefSeq Genomes and the RefSeq Representative Genomes databases using the “Organism” parameter of “Bacteria [taxid:2]” and the nonredundant nucleotide database. The results were filtered by 45% query coverage, which resulted in 185 unique bacterial strains. The GenBank files for each strain were downloaded, and homologous Hvr gene clusters were determined using MultiGeneBlast (75). Homologous Hvr biosynthetic gene clusters were organized by type based on gene arrangement within the cluster and the presence of additional gene functions.
