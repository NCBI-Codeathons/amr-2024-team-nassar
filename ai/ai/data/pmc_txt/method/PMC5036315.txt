RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Escherichia coli XL1-blue28 was used for cloning purposes, and the methylation-deficient strain E. coli ET1256729 was used to obtain unmethylated DNA for A. balhimycina transformations. A. balhimycina24 is the balhimycin-producing wild type (WT) and was used to generate the vnlS deletion as well as the vnlR-overexpressing strains (this study). Furthermore, ΔvnlR deletion27 was used for complementation (this study). S. coelicolor M60030 were used to generate S. coelicolor M600 ΔvanRS.6 This deletion strain was used to generate complementations with vnlRSAb, vnlRAb, vnlSAb, and vnlRAbD51A (this study). The overexpression plasmids pRM4vnlRSAb, pRM4vnlRAb, pRM4vnlSAb, and pRM4vnlRAbD51A are derived from pRM431, a pSET152-derived nonreplicative, ΦC31 integration vector with an integrated constitutive ermEp* promoter, an artificial ribosomal binding site, and an apramycin resistance cassette. The deletion vector pSPΔvnlSAb is derived from pSP132 in which flanking regions of vnlSAb were cloned. Media and culture conditions A. balhimycina grown in 100 ml TSB medium (Difco) for 48 hr and 2 ml of this preculture were used to inoculate the main cultures either in 100 ml R530 or in TSB medium. R5 medium was used to stimulate balhimycin production, while TSB medium was used when balhimycin production should be prevented. After 48 hr of cultivation, the mycelium was used to isolate PG precursors, to extract DNA, or to perform resistance assays against different glycopeptides. To isolate RNA, the cells were grown 15/39/63 hr. Balhimycin production assays were performed after 5 days of growth. S. coelicolor M145 and M600 were grown on Cullum-agar plates for sporulation. Isolated spores were used to inoculate 10 ml R5 medium as preculture for cell wall precursor extraction or DNA extraction. For RNA isolation, 2 ml of a 48-hr-old TSB preculture was used to inoculate 100 ml of HA medium. The cells were harvested after 69 hr. To compare the growth of the different S. coelicolor strains, 10 μl spores (∼1.5 × 107) of each strain were streaked on a YM plate. The plate was incubated for 7 days. A. balhimycina and S. coelicolor were grown at 30°C, and liquid cultures were shaken at 180 rpm. A. balhimycina and S. coelicolor strains were cultivated in 100 ml of R5 medium in an orbital shaker (220 rpm) in 500-ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks at 27°C. Liquid/solid media were supplemented with 100 μg/ml apramycin to select for strains carrying integrated antibiotic resistance genes. E. coli was grown in Luria-Bertani broth (Roth) at 37°C using 100 μg/μl apramycin or 150 μg/μl ampicillin for selection of plasmid-containing colonies. Liquid cultures were shaken at 180 rpm. Plasmid construction For the heterologous expression in S. coelicolor ΔvanRSSc, the entire coding regions of the vnlRAb (Table 2 primer 1 + 3), vnlRSAb (Table 2 primer 1 + 2), and vnlSAb (primer 4 + 2) were amplified using Kapa-Hifi proofreading polymerase and the corresponding primers in brackets. The vnlRAb (758 bp), vnlRSAb (1908 bp), and vnlSAb (1198 bp) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were integrated into pRM431 through the primer-attached restriction sites (Nde-EcoRI) downstream of the ermEp* promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension33 was performed for the exchange of aspartate at position 51 to an alanine with the primers 5 + 6 (Table 2). The 758 bp PCR product vnlRAbD51A was integrated into pRM4 through the primer-attached restriction sites (Nde-EcoRI) downstream of the ermEp* promoter. For the in-frame deletion of vnlSAb (1125 bp), a 1579 bp upstream fragment (Table 2 primer 7 + 8) and a 1509 bp downstream fragment (Table 2 primer 9 + 10) of vnlSAb were amplified from A. balhimycina genomic DNA using Kapa-Hifi proofreading polymerase and the corresponding primers in brackets. The plasmid pSPΔvnlS was constructed by integration of the fragments in pSP130 through the primer-attached restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends (EcoRI/XbaI and XbaI/SphI) (pSPΔvnlS). DNA transfer Transformation of E. coli XL1-blue28 and ET12567 (pUZ8002)34 was performed as described previously.35,36 Plasmids pRM4vnlRSAb, pRM4vnlRAb, pRM4vnlSAb, and pRM4vnlRAbD51A were transferred into S. coelicolor through intergeneric conjugation.30 Plasmid integration was confirmed by colony PCR using the primer pair 12 + 13 (Table 2) or primer 11 (Table 2) in combination with a reverse primer of corresponding gene. pRM4vnlRAb and pRM4vnlRAbD51A were transferred into A. balhimycina through the direct transformation method32,37 using unmethylated plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli ET12567. Integration of plasmid was verified by PCR using primer pair 11 + 3 (Table 2). For deletion of vnlSAb, A. balhimycina WT was transformed with pSPΔvnlSAb by direct transformation. The integration of the plasmid into the chromosome through homologous recombination was confirmed by PCR screening for the erythromycin resistance cassette, using primers ery for and ery rev (Table 2). To obtain deletion mutants, a second homologous recombination event was provoked by stressing plasmid-carrying colonies as described by Puk et al.38 Colonies were examined for sensitivity to erythromycin, and the deletions were verified by PCR analysis, using primers 16 + 17 (Table 2). Sequence alignment The amino acid (AA) sequences of VnlRSAb, VanRSc, and VanSSc are available under accession number Y16952 (named VanRS), (SCO3590), and (SCO3589), respectively. Alignment of the AA sequences was performed by EMBOSS stretcher39; (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_stretcher/). Resistance test, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses, PG precursor, and cell wall analysis Resistance test, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses, extraction of PG precursors, PG isolation, and the high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analyses were performed as described.27,40 Balhimycin concentration The balhimycin concentration in 1 ml culture was quantified using HPLC with a photodiode array detector (HPLC-DAD) as described.40 The balhimycin concentration was calculated to 100 μg/ml total DNA. Inference of biomass concentration from DNA quantification For the quantification of total DNA in 1 ml culture, an acid extraction of DNA coupled with a colorimetric method41 was performed by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm. To analyze the amount of DNA, a standard curve with salmon sperm DNA was generated.
