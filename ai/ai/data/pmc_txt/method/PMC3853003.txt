Methods Bacterial growth and DNA extraction P. flavipulchra JG1 was isolated from rearing water of healthy turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) in Qingdao, China and was routinely grown on marine agar 2216 (MA; Difco) at 28°C. Genomic DNA was extracted from 5 ml overnight culture by standard methods
[66]. Genomic DNA was quantified on 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and assessed spectrophotometrically. The biosensors Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and VIR24 were used to detect the short-chain (C4-C8) and long-chain (C8-C14) acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), respectively. Both of them were grown on Luria–Bertani (LB) agar at 28°C. Genome sequencing, annotation and analysis The genome sequence of P. flavipulchra JG1 was determined using the Illumina HiSeq2000 with a 500 bp paired-end library and achieved about 600 Mb data with 111.9-fold coverage. The reads were assembled using SOAPdenovo assembler software
[67] subsequently. A total of 122 contigs ranging from 128 bp to 264 447 bp (the N50 and N90 contig sizes were 107 608 bp and 34 132 bp, respectively) were obtained and combined into 61 scaffolds ranging from 500 bp to 879 239 bp (the N50 and N90 contig sizes were 338 061 bp and 74 731 bp, respectively). Putative protein-encoding genes were identified with GLIMMER
[68], transposons were predicted with Repeat Masker and Repeat Protein Masker
[69], and tandem repeat sequences were identified through Tandem Repeat Finder
[70]. Annotation was performed with BLASTALL 2.2.21
[71] searching against protein databases KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes;
http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
[72], COG (
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/)
[73], SwissProt and TrEMBL (
http://www.uniprot.org/) and NR (NCBI non-redundant database;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/)
[74]. The criteria used to assign function to a CDS were a minimum cutoff of 30% identity and at least four best hits among the COG, KEGG, NR, SwissProt or TrEMBL protein databases. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by alignment of sequences using Clustal W
[75] and neighbor-joining trees were generated with 1 000 bootstraps. The prediction of signal peptides (SP) was performed using SignalP v 4.1
[76]. The conserved domains were predicted using Conserved Domain Database of NCBI
[77]. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession AJMP00000000. The version described in this paper is the first version, AJMP01000000. Comparative genomics According to the result of phylogenetic analysis, the genome sequences of P. tunicata D2 and P. haloplanktis TAC125 were retrieved from NCBI. Proteins from P. flavipulchra JG1 were compared with those of D2 and TAC125, using BLASTP with an E-value cutoff of 1e-5. Orthologous proteins are defined as reciprocal best hit proteins with a minimum 40% identity and 70% of the length of the query protein, calculated by the BLAST algorithm. Proteins without orthologs are considered to be specific proteins. The COG function category was analyzed by searching all predicted proteins against the COG database on the basis of the BLASTP. Catalase effect on the antibacterial activity An 8 mm disc loaded with 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg and 0.5 mg of catalase in 10 μl distilled water was used and placed neighboring to the circular wells loaded with 20 μl extracellular proteins of P. flavipulchra JG1, respectively
[14]. The catalase inhibition of antibacterial effect was observed by the eclipse of inhibition areas. AHLs degradation bioassay C6 to C14-HSL and 3-oxo-C6 to 3-oxo-C14-HSL were used for evaluating the AHL degradation activity of P. flavipulchra JG1. Briefly, extra- and intra-cellular products of strain JG1 were mixed with different acyl chains of AHLs, the final concentrations of these AHLs were 1 μM for C10-HSL, C12-HSL and C14-HSL, and 0.1 μM for the rest AHLs. The mixtures were incubated at 28°C for 24 hours and the residual AHLs were detected by Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and VIR24 plate assay
[78]. Electron microscopy and motility assay An overnight culture of strain JG1 was negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.4) on a Formvar carbon-coated grid and observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM-1200EX, Japan)
[79]. Swimming and swarming motilities were evaluated by point inoculating JG1 on MA plates containing 0.3% and 0.5% agar, respectively. The plates were analyzed after incubation at 28°C for about 24 h. The experiment was performed in triplicate. Chitinase activity and antibiotic resistance The chitinase activity of P. flavipulchra JG1 were observed using chitin agar following the method described by Hsu et al.[80]. Resistance to antibiotics of strain JG1 was investigated by the agar diffusion method using the filter discs containing different antibiotics. Briefly, 100 μl aliquots of overnight broth culture of JG1 were spread onto the surface of MA plates, and different antibiotic discs were placed on the target plates, respectively, which were then incubated at 28°C for 24 h. Inhibition zones of the antibiotics-containing discs were observed.
