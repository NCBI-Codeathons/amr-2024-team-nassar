Sequence Analysis The genome information of the emetic reference strain F4810/72 (AH187), retrieved from the NCBI website (GenBank accession no. CP001177 and CP001179), was used for sequence analysis of the ces locus and homology searches. Amino acid sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database and protein homology search was performed using Blastp available at NCBI1. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out with Clustal W using default parameters (Thompson et al., 1994). Maximum-likelihood trees were constructed with MEGA 5 (Tamura et al., 2011) using the Jones–Thornton–Taylor (JTT) model. All positions containing gaps were eliminated. Numbers at nodes (≥50%) represent bootstrap support of 500 resamplings. Annotation of characteristic protein domains and membrane spanning motifs was achieved with the SMART database (Letunic et al., 2012) and the programs TMHMM2 and TMpred3. Construction of B. cereus ΔcesP and ΔcesCD Deletion Mutants Deletion and complementation mutants were constructed as described previously (Lücking et al., 2009). In brief, flanking regions of cesP and cesCD were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs listed in Supplementary Table S2. Digested PCR products, together with an excised spectinomycin resistance cassette (spc) from pUC1318spc (Murphy, 1985), were ligated into the TOPO pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen). For cesP, an additional construct with a non-polar mutagenic spectinomycin cassette from pSPCH+2 (Mesnage et al., 2000) was produced to avoid polar effects of the spectinomycin cassette on the ces operon genes located downstream of cesP. Constructs were excised from TOPO and inserted into the conjugative suicide vector pAT113, giving rise to pAT113ΔcesP/spc, pAT113ΔcesCD/spc, and pAT113ΔcesP/spcH+2 (see Supplementary Table S1 for details). Plasmids were then transformed into E. coli JM83/pRK24 by heat shock and the resulting strains were used for transconjugal transfer into B. cereus F4810/72 using a mating procedure previously described (Pezard et al., 1991). For complementation of F48ΔcesCD and F48ΔcesP/Ippt, the genes cesCD and cesP were amplified using the primers cesCD_F_Xba/cesCD_R_Pae and cesP_Pro_F2/cesP_Pro_R (Supplementary Table S2), respectively, and cloned into the shuttle vector pAD123 together with the ∼500 bp ces promoter region. For complementation of F48ΔcesP/Ippt with ppt (NCBI accession no. ACJ79141), the respective gene was amplified with ppt_chr_F and ppt_chr_R and ligated into the shuttle vector pMM1522, containing a xylose-inducible promoter. Constructs were propagated in the non-methylating E. coli strain INV110 cells and then introduced into the according B. cereus mutant by electroporation, giving rise to F48ΔcesCD/com_cesCD, F48ΔcesP/Ippt/com_cesP, and F48ΔcesP/Ippt/com_ppt. Construction of B. cereus cesH and ppt Insertion- and Overexpression Mutants Gene inactivation by pMAD integration was performed as described previously (Dommel et al., 2011). In brief, internal fragments (∼300 bp) of cesH and ppt (NCBI accession no. ACJ79141) were amplified by PCR using primers listed in Table S2 and ligated into the thermosensitive shuttle vector pMAD. Constructs were introduced into B. cereus F4810/72 or F48ΔcesP by electroporation and transformants were obtained after 2 days at 30°C on LB plates with erythromycin and X-Gal (20 μg/ml). Plasmid integration was enforced by re-cultivation of a blue colony in LB medium overnight at 42°C for several times. For further experiments, the resulting strains F48IcesH, F48Ippt, and F48ΔcesP/Ippt were cultured at high temperatures (37 or 42°C), which is essential to avoid the loss of the integrated plasmid. For cesH overexpression, the promoterless cesH gene was amplified using the respective primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. The digested fragment was ligated into pMM1522, harboring a xylose-inducible promoter, and then introduced in B. cereus F4810/72 by electroporation. To induce gene overexpression, 0.1 % D-xylose (v/v) was added to the culture medium. Production of a Monoclonal anti-CesB Antibody For generation of a monoclonal antibody targeting the cereulide NRPS, the DNA fragment (3999 bp) encoding the first CesB submodule (CesB1: consisting of an adenylation-, ketoreductase-, and peptidyl carrier protein domain) including the native cesB ribosome binding site was amplified with Pfu polymerase (Promega) from genomic DNA of B. cereus F4810/72 using the primer pair cesB135Nco_for/cesB135Xho_rev (Supplementary Table S2). Cloning via the XhoI/NcoI sites into the pET28b(+) vector resulted in a transcriptional C-terminal His6 tag fusion. CesB1-His6 was amplified from pET28-cesB1 by PCR with cesBpETSpe_for2 and cesBpETSph_rev2 and cloned into the SpeI and SphI restriction sites of pWH1520, giving rise to the xylose-inducible overexpression plasmid pWHCesB1His. This construct was transferred into B. megaterium WH320 protoplasts by PEG-fusion according to the manufacturer’s protocol (MoBiTec, Göttingen). The CesB1His6 protein was overexpressed in recovered B. megaterium cells and purified using Ni-NTA affinity columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The monoclonal antibody (mAB) CesB5-6 was raised by BioGenes (Berlin) using the purified CesB1His6 protein, NMRI mice (obtained from Janvier, France), and the myeloma cell line SP2/0-Ag14 (obtained from DSMZ, Germany). Purified CesB1 mAB with a concentration of 1.68 μg ml-1 in PBS solution was tested for its specificity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA; data not shown) and by immunoblotting. Reverse Transcription-qPCR To analyze cesA transcript levels, 1 ml culture samples of B. cereus strains were harvested at OD600 8 by centrifugation (10000 g, 4°C, 2 min). Total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and RT-qPCR were carried out as described previously (Dommel et al., 2011). Transcript levels of the 16S rrn gene served as the reference control for data normalization and relative gene expression ratios were calculated with the REST software (Pfaﬄ et al., 2002). Western- and Slot Blot Analysis of CesB Twenty milliliter of B. cereus cultures, grown to different optical densities, were centrifuged (9500 rpm, 6 min, Sigma 3–18K with angle rotor 19776) and cell pellets resuspended in 2 ml lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 2 mM EDTA pH 7.5, 1 mM Pefabloc (Merck)]. Cells were disrupted by two passages through a French Pressure cell press (1000 psi) and the soluble protein fraction was collected by centrifugation of the lysates (13000 rpm, 2x 30 min, 4°C). Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford using the Roti-Quant solution (Carl Roth GmbH). For Western blot analysis, 30 μg of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and the proteins were immobilized onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) by semi-dry blotting for 2 h at 120 mA. A 1:2000 dilution of the monoclonal anti-CesB antibody was used to detect the CesB1 module. The second incubation was done with a 1:20000-dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova) and blots were developed with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). For slot blot analysis, 25 μg of total protein was blotted directly onto a PVDF membrane by vacuum filtration. Again, the 1:2000 dilution of the monoclonal anti-CesB antibody was used to detect the CesB module of the cereulide synthetase. In addition, blots of the same samples were performed with a 1:5000 dilution of a polyclonal rabbit anti-AtpB serum (Agrisera) detecting the beta subunit of the ATP synthase. As second antibodies served an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1: 10000 dilution, Dianova) and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000, Dianova), respectively. Chromogenic detection of alkaline phosphatase activity was accomplished with BICP-p-toluidine salt- and NBT solutions (Carl Roth GmbH) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sample Preparation and Cereulide Quantification by Means of UPLC-MS/MS The biosynthetic production of cereulide in LB broth supplemented with 0.2% glucose and of 13C-labeled cereulide in MOD medium supplemented with 13C1-L-valine was carried out as described previously (Bauer et al., 2010). Extraction of cereulide from autoclaved cells of different B. cereus strains grown in 100 ml LB broth was carried out as described (Stark et al., 2013), using 1 ng of 13C6-cereulide as internal standard. Cereulide quantification via stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) was performed using a Xevo TQ-S Acquity i-class UPLC-MS/MS system and an UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm; Waters, UK and USA). One microliter aliquots of ethanolic extracts (of B. cereus samples) were injected directly into the UPLC/MS-MS system. Operated with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at a temperature of 50°C, the following gradient was used for chromatography: starting with a mixture (90/10, v/v) of methanol and 10 mM ammonium formate (0.1% formic acid), the methanol content was increased to 100% within 0.5 min, kept constant for 0.3 min and decreased within 0.1 min to 90%. Measurements were performed using electrospray with positive ionization and the quantitative calibration mode consisting of the following ion source parameters: capillary voltage +3.5 kV, sampling cone 30 V, source offset 30 V, source temperature 150°C, desolvation temperature 600°C, cone gas 150 L/h, desolvation gas 1000 L/h, collision gas flow 0.15 ml/min and nebuliser gas flow 6.5 bar. Calibration of the TQ-S in the range from m/z 40-1963 was performed using a solution of phosphoric acid (0.1% in acetonitrile). The UPLC and Xevo TQ-S systems were operated with MassLnyxTM 4.1 SCN 813 software, data processing and analysis were performed using TargetLynx. By means of the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, the ammonium adducts of cereulide (qualifier: m/z 1170.7→172.2; 1170.7→314.2; quantifier: m/z 1170.7→357.2) and 13C6-cereulide (m/z 1176.7→173.2; 1176.7→316.3; 1176.7→358.3) were analyzed using the mass transitions (given in brackets) monitored for a duration of 25 ms. ESI+ mass and product ion spectra were acquired with direct flow infusion using IntelliStart. The MS/MS parameters were tuned for each individual compound, detecting the fragmentation of the [M+NH4]+ molecular ions into specific product ions after collision with argon. For quantitation, 10 ethanolic standard solutions of the analyte cereulide (0.05–10.0 ng/ml) and the internal standard 13C6-cereulide (1 ng/ml) were mixed and analyzed in triplicates by means of UPLC–MS/MS using the MRM mode. Calibration curve was prepared by plotting peak area ratios of analyte to internal standard against concentration ratios of each analyte to the internal standard using linear regression. Cytotoxicity Test Aliquots of B. cereus cultures were taken after 24 h of incubation and autoclaved (15 min at 121°C) to lyse cells and denature heat-labile toxins. Cereulide amounts of these samples were determined using the HEp-2 cell based cell culture assay as previously described (Lücking et al., 2009). Cereulide titres of the mutant strains were normalized to the value of the parental strain B. cereus F4810/72 (grown for 24 h at 30 or 37°C, respectively), which was defined as being 100%.
