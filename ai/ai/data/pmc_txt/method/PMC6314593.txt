Materials and methods Identification of open reading frames Metagenomic analysis of Illumina MiSeq data was conducted using our previously published protocols [14]. FASTQC and BowTie2 were used to inspect reads for overall quality and to identify contaminants from sequencing. Reads were trimmed to 400 bp in length to remove low-quality terminal sequences from further analysis. MegaHIT alignment software processed reads in FASTq format and stitched reads into longer contigs by identifying overlapping coding regions [15]. Prodigal was used to identify open reading frames (ORFs) by searching sequences in six frames across both DNA strands [16]. A ‘-c’ command modifier in Prodigal was used to ensure the program only detected ORFs with both start and stop codons present. Prodigal was instructed to search for Shine-Dalgarno sequences required for ribosome binding to prokaryotic mRNAs, and non-canonical start codons CUG, GUG and ACG which are typically found in up to 10% of prokaryotic ORFs; these products are often overlooked by conventional searches and absent from many databases [37, 38]. These restrictions were expected to largely limit our hits to prokaryotic genes regulated by Shine-Dalgarno sequences. In silico protein function predictions pHmmer was used to identify putative function of protein domains [17,39]. Protein domains and possible functions were identified using the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank [40]. E-values were calculated to compare domains identified in putative proteins to known domains in the database [40]. Putative proteins with the lowest e-values were queried against the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) database using pHmmer to identify proteins with major protein domain conservation. Selected candidate genes were codon-optimized for E. coli and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) as gBlock gene fragments. Amino acid sequence analysis Phylogenetic trees were generated and interpreted in Geneious R 8.1.8. using RAxML version 7.2.8 with the protein model GAMMA LG (algorithm: Rapid bootstrapping with 100 replicate trees for statistical power) [41]. Amino acid alignments were completed using ClustalW alignment with the cost matrix: BLOSUM with a gap open cost of 10 and a gap extend cost of 0.1 [42]. Putative genes were submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers as follows: β-Glucosidase MH590637, α-L-arabinofuranosidase MH590638, β-xylosidase MH590639, Endo-1,4-β-xylanase MH590640. Gene cloning Candidate genes were PCR-amplified from IDT gBlock gene fragments with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase according to manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, MA, USA). PCR products were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit protocol (Qiagen Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) (Table 1) and cloned into the pET26b(+) expression plasmid (MilliporeSigma); this plasmid enables the creation of fusion proteins with PelB leader sequences required for translocation to the periplasm after which they can be secreted into the extracellular space [43]. Thus, by fusing our putative enzymes to PelB we increased the likelihood of secretion to the extracellular space to access lignocellulosic substrates. Candidate genes and pET26b(+) were digested with restriction endonucleases (NEB) indicated in Table 1 for 1 hour at 37°C. Digested DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen Inc.), then ligated with pET26b(+) plasmid DNA using T4 DNA ligase (NEB). Ligation products were transformed into chemically competent Stbl3 E. coli via heat-shock transformation [44]. Specifically, 5 μL of ligation products were added to 50 μL of E. coli suspension in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, and following heat-shock transformation, 250 μL of LB broth was added during the 1-hour recovery stage and the mixture was subsequently plated on LB agar supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 18–24 hours to allow the growth of transformants. Colonies were picked and inoculated into 5 mL of LB broth, grown overnight to saturation, and plasmid DNA was extracted via QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Plasmids were screened by restriction digestion, and processed for Sanger sequencing (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of candidate genes.

The pET26b(+) vector contains a carboxy-terminal 6xHIS tag downstream from the multiple cloning site (MCS). Initially, the candidate genes were cloned with a translation stop codon that interrupted the 6xHIS tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to delete the stop codon, restoring the 6xHIS tag. The constructs were amplified using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase according to manufacturer’s instructions (NEB). Fractions of each PCR product were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel to confirm size. PCR products was purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). After purification, the 6xHIS tagged constructs were ligated using T4 DNA ligase for 1 hr at 37°C (NEB). Inducible protein expression All pET26b(+) 6xHIS tagged candidate genes were transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli to enable inducible protein expression. Selected colonies were inoculated into 5 mL of LB broth and incubated at 37°C in a shaker (220 RPM) overnight. The overnight culture was diluted 1:100 in 2.5 mL LB broth and incubated in a shaker until the OD600 of the culture reached 0.5–0.8. Once in log phase, 0.1 mM IPTG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was added to induce protein expression. After 3 hours of shaking incubation at 37°C, bacteria were pelleted at 16000 x g for 2 min, supernatant was collected, and pellets were harvested in 2x electrophoresis sample buffer (ESB) or subjected to periplasmic fractionation. Protein was collected from the supernatant as previously described by Sarty et al. with some modification [45]. Specifically, 2.5 mL of clarified supernatant was passed through 0.2 μm PEL syringe filter and placed on ice for 10 min before trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The periplasmic fraction was isolated using previously described cold osmotic shock [19]. Briefly, after the bacteria were pelleted, supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 625 μL Cell Fractionation Buffer 1 (0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 g/L sucrose, 0.1 M EDTA) then incubated at 4°C for 20 min with regular inversion. After incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 16000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 625 μL Cell Fractionation Buffer 2 (0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.005 M MgSO4, 0.2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 20 min at 4°C with regular inversion. The suspension was centrifuged as before, and the supernatant was collected as the periplasmic fraction. TCA precipitation was done to concentrate the protein. The vector pET26b(+) (EV) was used as a negative control. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PDVF and immunoblotted using a mouse anti-penta-HIS antibody (Qiagen, Cat. 34660). Protein purification E. coli bearing pET26b(+)-endo-1,4-β-xylanase, pET26b(+)-β-glucosidase, or pET26b(+)-α-L-arabinofuranosidase plasmids were grown in 5 mL LB broth with 25 μg/mL kanamycin for 6 hrs at 37°C, shaking, from a single clone. After initial incubation, 1 mL of culture was used to inoculate 100 mL of fresh LB broth with 25 μg/mL kanamycin and 1mM IPTG for overnight induction at 30°C, shaking. After induction, the cultures were centrifuged at 3220 x g for 20 min and supernatant was decanted from pellet. The cell pellets were resuspended in Wash Buffer (20 mM Na2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and sonicated for a total of 6 min in 30 sec intervals on ice, then centrifuged at 8000 xg for 30 min at 4°C. Subsequently, supernatant was loaded into a column containing HisPur Cobalt Resin (Thermofisher) pre-equilibrated with Wash Buffer. The column was washed with six volumes of Wash Buffer, followed by elution in Elution Buffer (150 mM imidazole, 20 mM Na2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Glycerol was added to the purified protein at a final concentration of 10% to maintain proper protein folding. Recombinant strain pET26b(+)-β-xylosidase was difficult to purify and a modified protocol was used as previously described by Zimmermann et al. [46]. Briefly, 1L of LB broth (no antibiotic) was inoculated with 5 mL of saturated overnight pET26b(+)-β-xylosidase culture (containing kanamycin). The culture was shaken at 37°C at 220 rpm until the OD600 was between 0.4 and 0.7. Once an appropriate optical density was reached, the culture was incubated at 42°C for 10 min, recovered at 37°C for 20 min, placed on ice for 30 min, and recovered again at 37°C for 30 min. Following heat- and cold-shock treatments, the culture was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG and incubated overnight at 20°C while shaking. The following morning, cultures were pelleted and purified as described above. In vitro enzyme assays The activity of candidate β-xylosidase, β-glucosidase, and α-L-arabinofuranosidase enzymes was tested using p-nitrophenol (pNP) derivatives pNP-β-D-xylopyranoside, pNP-β-D-glucopyranoside, and pNP-α-L-arabinofuranoside, respectively. When cleaved by active enzyme, these compounds release pNP which can be measured by absorbance at 410 nm wavelength. General experimental procedure combined 900 μL of 5 mM pNP derivative in buffer, which was used to blank the spectrophotometer (Nanodrop One, Thermo Scientific), once 100 μL of appropriately diluted enzyme was added, the absorbance was measured at 410 nm every minute for 15 or 30 min. Optimum pH for β-xylosidase was determined using 2 different 50 mM buffers: citrate buffer at pH 5, and phosphate buffer at pH 6. Optimum pH for β-glucosidase was determined by using three different buffers (50 mM) at pH 5: citrate buffer, pH 6: phosphate buffer, and pH 7: phosphate buffer. Optimum pH for α-L-arabinofuranosidase was determined using three different 50 mM buffers: citrate buffer for pH 5 and 5.5, and a phosphate buffer for pH 6. β-glucosidase was assessed for N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase activity using pNP-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide as described above. The activity of endo-1,4-β-xylanase was determined using 6-chloro-4-methylumbelliferyl xylobioside (CMU-X2). When cleaved by an active enzyme, 6-chloro-4-methylumbelliferyl is released from xylobiose and can be excited to fluoresce at 450 nm. 100 μM CMU-X2 was added to 0.6 μg of affinity-purified endo-1,4-β-xylanase in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 4, 5, 5.5, 6) or sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5, 7, 7.5) in a 96-well plate (Grenier). Fluorescence was measured (Excitation 365 nm, Emission 450 nm) at 37°C using a plate reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax M2) immediately and every minute for 30 minutes to determine optimal pH for enzyme activity. Fluorescence at optimal pH was then compared to a commercial β-glucosidase (DesR) as a negative control as above. Thermostability of the putative endo-1,4-β-xylanase was determined by incubating samples containing 0.6 μg of enzyme for 30 minutes at 37°C, 50°C, 60°C, or 70°C prior to addition of CMU-X2. Samples were then read as before. Control is unincubated endo-1,4-β-xylanase. To calculate kinetic constants, initial rate of product formation (cleavage of CMU from xylobiose) was calculated for 0.6 μg of endo-1,4-β-xylanase incubated with 10 μM, 15 μM, 20 μM, 40 μM, 100 μM, 150 μM, 200 μM, and 250 μM CMU-X2 substrate. Kinetic constants KM and kcat for the putative endo-1,4-β-xylanase were determined and represented on a Lineweaver-Burk plot. Cellobiose solid-phase growth assay BL21 E. coli containing pET26b(+)-β-glucosidase plasmid vector, empty vector negative control, or positive control pET28b(+)-DesR [14] were cultured overnight in 5 mL LB broth with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37°C, shaking. The next day, 1 ml of overnight culture was added to 4 mL of LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 1 mM IPTG and placed in a shaking incubator at 37°C. After 4 hours, 1 ml of culture was plated on cellobiose M9 solid media (33.7 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4, 8.55 mM NaCl, 9.35 mM NH4Cl, 12% cellobiose, 1 mM MgSO4 and 0.03 mM CaCl2) and incubated overnight at 37°C. Colony growth was visually scored on the following day.
