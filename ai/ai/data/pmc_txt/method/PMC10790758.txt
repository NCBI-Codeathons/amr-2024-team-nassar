MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and growth conditions All bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table S1. For liquid culture growth, single colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 (83) were used to inoculate lysogeny broth (LB; 1% tryptone, 1% NaCl, 0.5% yeast extract) (84) or 1% tryptone, as described, and shaken at 37°C, 200 rpm. Generally, liquid precultures were used as inocula for experiments. Biological replicates came from separate clonal source colonies on a streaked agar plate. TTC reduction assay Precultures were grown for 14–16 hours, subcultured 1:100, and grown to an OD 500 nm of ~0.5. Five microliters were spotted onto 60 mL of 1% tryptone, 1% agar (Teknova, A7777) containing 0.004% (wt/vol) TTC [2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, T8877)] in 10 cm × 10 cm × 1.5 cm plates. Plates were incubated for 1 day in the dark at 25°C with >90% humidity and imaged using a flatbed scanner (Epson, E11000XL-GA). TTC reduction was quantified by measuring the average saturation in the red hue for all pixels in the colony biofilm area. Construction of fluorescent reporter strains All plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S2. To construct reporter strains, promoter regions of varying length or with nucleotide changes (as specified in the strain name and in the text) were amplified from the PA14 genome using primers listed in Table S3 and inserted upstream of the coding sequence of gfp using SpeI and XhoI sites in the MCS of the pLD2722 vector. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli UQ950 cells and verified by sequencing. Verified plasmids were introduced into PA14 using biparental conjugation with E. coli S17-1. Single recombinants were selected on agar plates with M9 minimal medium (47.8 mM Na2HPO47H2O, 2 mM KH2PO4, 8.6 mM NaCl, 18.6 mM NH4Cl, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 20 mM sodium citrate dihydrate, 1.5% agar) containing 70 µg/mL gentamicin. The plasmid backbone was resolved out of PA14 using Flp-FRT recombination using the pFLP2 plasmid (85) and selection on M9 minimal medium agar plates containing 300 µg/mL carbenicillin. Strains were cured of the pFLP2 plasmid by streaking on LB agar plates without NaCl with 10% (wt/vol) sucrose. The presence of gfp in final clones was confirmed by PCR. Shuffled reporters were constructed using an overlap PCR in which two fragments were generated flanking the region to be shuffled with the shuffled sequence introduced with the primers. Then, the overlap PCR was performed such that one single fragment was generated from the two fragments. Fragment was inserted into pLD2722 using SpeI and XhoI digest sites and introduced into PA14 as above. Construction of deletion mutant strains All plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S2. Markerless deletion mutants in Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 were made by amplifying ~1 kb of flanking sequence on each side of the deletion region using the primers listed in Table S3 and inserting flanks into pMQ30 plasmid through gap repair cloning in S. cerevisiae InvSc1 (86). Plasmids were transformed into E. coli UQ950, verified by sequencing, and introduced into PA14 using biparental conjugation with E. coli WM3064. Single recombinants were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/mL gentamicin. Double recombinants were selected on LB without NaCl with 10% (wt/vol) sucrose. Deletions were verified by PCR. Combinatorial mutants were made using a single deletion as PA14 parental background. Complements were made as described above by amplifying the flanking regions and the coding sequence together and introduced into the deletion background. Point mutants were created as described for deletion mutants with the exception that the initial primers introduced the specified codon change and included the entire coding region and ~1 kb of flanking sequence. Constructs were then introduced into the deletion strain and checked for “complementation.” Construction of MpaR overexpression strains The coding region of MpaR was amplified using primers LD4387 and LD4388, and the rrnB terminator was amplified from pAKN69 using primers LD4389 and LD4077 such that the two fragments had ~20-bp overlapping sequence similarity. An overlap PCR was performed using LD4387 and LD4077 and the two fragments (~75 ng each) as template. The resulting fragment (MpaR coding region with a terminator) was restriction digest cloned into pAKN69 using SphI and NheI restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli WM3064, verified by sequencing, and introduced into PA14 using biparental conjugation with E. coli WM3064. Single recombinants were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/mL gentamicin. Plasmid backbones were not resolved out. Colony biofilm morphology assay Precultures grown for 14–16 hours were subcultured 1:100 and grown until OD 500 nm of ~0.5. 10 µL was spotted onto 60 mL of colony morphology medium [1% tryptone, 1% agar (Teknova, A7777)] containing 40 µg/mL Congo red dye (VWR, AAAB24310-14) and 20 µg/mL Coomassie blue dye (VWR, EM-3300)] in a 10 cm × 10 cm × 1.5 cm plates. Plates were incubated for up to 5 days at 25°C with >90% humidity and imaged using a flatbed scanner (Epson, E11000XL-GA). Biofilm thin sectioning Sectioning was performed as previously described (87). Briefly, precultures grown for 14–16 hours were subcultured 1:100 and grown until OD 500 nm of ~0.5. Five microliters were spotted onto 45 mL/15 mL bilayer 1% tryptone 1% agar (Teknova, A7777) square 10 cm × 10 cm × 1.5 cm plates and incubated for 72 hours at 25°C. Biofilms were overlaid with 15 mL of 1% molten agar, allowed to solidify for 5–10 minutes, and then excised by lifting from the bottom layer into histocassettes where they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.2) for 24 hours. Samples were then washed in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations (25%, 50%, 70%, 95% ethanol in PBS, three times in 100% ethanol) followed by clearing with three washes in Histo-Clear II (National Diagnostics; Fisher Scientific HS-202) and then infiltrated with molten paraffin wax (Leica Biosystems, 39601006) . Samples were then embedded in paraffin wax in rectangular wax molds and allowed to solidify for 2–3 hours. Excess wax was removed from the sample blocks, and the center of the biofilm was sectioned in 10-µm steps using an automatic microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 905200ER). Sections were floated in water and mounted on a pre-charged glass slide. Slides air dried overnight then heat fixed at 45°C for 30 minutes. Once cooled, the slides were rehydrated in PBS by reversing the dehydration steps listed above. Sections were mounted with Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36965) and covered with coverslips. Coverslips were sealed with quick-dry nail polish and imaged on a ZEISS Axio Zoom.V16. Non-fluorescent parental strains were used as a control for colony auto-fluorescence. In the graphs shown, fluorescent signal has been corrected for the respective parental background fluorescence. Liquid culture growth and reporter-strain fluorescence assays Overnight precultures in biological triplicate were diluted 1:100 into 1% tryptone in 96-well, black-sided, clear-bottomed plate (Greiner Bio-One; Millipore Sigma, M5811) and incubated at 37°C with continuous shaking on the medium setting in a Biotek Synergy H1 plate reader. Growth and promoter activity were assessed by taking OD readings at 500 nm and fluorescence readings at excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 nm and 510 nm, respectively, every 30 minutes for 24 hours. Cyanide-dependent induction assay Precultures were grown for 14–16 hours, then subcultured 1:100, and grown to an OD 500 nm of ~0.5. Five microliters of the cultures were spotted ~1 cm apart onto 60 mL of 1% tryptone, 1% agar (Teknova, A7777) in a 10 cm × 10 cm × 1.5 cm plates. Plates were incubated for up to 3 days at 25°C with >90% humidity and imaged using a ZEISS Axio Zoom.V16. No additional cyanide was added to the medium. High-performance liquid chromatography Precultures grown for 14–16 hours were subcultured 1:100 and grown until OD 500 nm of ~0.5. Ten microliters were spotted onto 4 mL of 1% tryptone, 1% agar (Teknova, A7777) in 30-mm circular petri plates. Plates were incubated for 3 days in the dark at 25°C with >90% humidity. The entire biofilm and agar were harvested by submerging in 5 mL of 100% methanol and rocking overnight at room temperature. The following day, the methanol extracts were filtered through Costar 0.22-µm cellulose acetate Spin-X centrifuge tube filters (Fisher Scientific, 07200386); then, 200 µL was loaded into HPLC vials for analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent 1100 HPLC system) as previously described (88, 89) and by comparing sample peaks to peaks of pure phenazine standards run as controls. The area under each peak was integrated and used to determine the concentration of each phenazine. Sample preparation for Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) measurements Precultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown for 14–16 hours were subcultured 1:100 and grown until OD 500 nm of ~0.5. Five microliters were spotted onto 60-mL 1% tryptone 1% agar (Teknova, A7777) square 10 cm × 10 cm × 1.5 cm plates and incubated for 72 hours at 25°C. Biofilms were collected into 1 mL of PBS and were physically disrupted by pipetting. Pellets were collected and washed twice more with PBS before resuspending in 500-µL Mass Spec Lysis Buffer (8 M urea, 75 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Samples were sonicated on ice using the microtip of a Branson Sonifier 250 (50% duty cycle 50% output) for 90 seconds (30-second sonication, 1-minute rest three times). Samples were clarified by centrifugation for 20,000 × g for 5 minutes, and the protein content of the supernatant was measured by Qubit. Forty micrograms of protein for each sample were reduced with a final concentration of 5 mM dithriothreitol (DTT) for 45 minutes at room temperature and then alkylated with a final concentration of 10 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 45 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Samples were diluted with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) such that the final concentration of urea was less than 2 M. Samples were digested overnight with 0.4 µg trypsin (Promega, V5113) for a 1:100 enzyme to protein ratio. After 16 hours of digestion, samples were acidified with 1% formic acid (final concentration). Tryptic peptides were desalted on C18 StageTips according to reference (90) and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Dried peptides were then reconstituted in 3% acetonitrile/0.2% formic acid to a final concentration of 0.5 µg/µL. LC-MS/MS analysis on a Q-Exactive HF About 1 µg of total peptides was analyzed on a Waters M-Class UPLC using a 15-cm Ionopticks Aurora Elite SX nanoflow UHPLC column (C18 1.7-µm stationary phase) Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer. Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 400 nL/min with a 90-minute gradient, including sample loading and column equilibration times. Data were acquired in data independent mode using Xcalibur software. MS1 spectra were measured with a resolution of 120,000, and a mass range from 350 to 1650 m/z. MS2 spectra were measured in 23 segment windows per MS1, each with an isolation window width of 56 m/z (0.5 m/z overlap with the neighboring window), a resolution of 30,000, an AGC target of 3e6, and a stepped collision energy of 22.5, 25, 27.5. All raw data were analyzed with SpectroNaut software version 18.0 (Biognosys) using a directDIA method based on a UniProt Pseudomonas aeruginosa database (UP000000653), performed with the “BGS factory settings” including the following parameters: oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications; carbamidomethylation as fixed modification; trypsin/P as the digestion enzyme. For identification, we applied a maximum FDR of 1% separately on protein and peptide level. “Cross run normalization” was activated. This gave intensity values for a total of 3,024 protein groups across all samples and replicates. “PG.Quantity” (normalized across samples) values were used for all subsequent analyses.
