Growth Inhibition of Actinosynnema pretiosum WXR-24 Under Exogenous AP-3 Supplementation The previously constructed high-yield strain NXJ-24 has an integrated copy of the pSET152-based plasmid (pLQ586) in the genome [14]. For stable fermentation and convenience of further engineering, an alternative strain WXR-24 was constructed by introducing the overexpressing cassette (kasOp*-asm10) from pLQ586 to the chromosome by double crossover recombination (Table S1). To test whether WXR-24 has the potential to be a high-yield AP-3 producer, its tolerance to high concentrations of AP-3 was evaluated. The growth of WXR-24 was determined on YMG plates containing 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/L AP-3. After 3 days, no decrease in survival rate was observed under supplementation of 100 mg/L AP-3. However, when the AP-3 concentration increased to 200 mg/L, the survival rate decreased to 72%. No growth occurred on plates with 300 mg/L and 400 mg/L AP-3 (Figure 1a,b and Table S2). After 16 days of incubation, slow growth was observed on plates containing 300 mg/L and 400 mg/L AP-3, with 150 and 11 CFUs, respectively (Figure S3). In addition, the average colony size of WXR-24 decreased 38.4% with supplementation of 100 mg/L AP-3, and a further decrease of 66.0% was observed with 200 mg/L AP-3 (Table S3), suggesting growth inhibition of WXR-24 by AP-3 on YMG plates. Cell growth in liquid medium was also studied. In the medium without AP-3 supplementation, OD600 of WXR-24 increased rapidly from 0.05 to 0.25 during cultivation. While the initial OD600 was unchanged, the final OD600 decreased from 0.25 to 0.22, 0.20, 0.11 and 0.08 in media supplemented with 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/L AP-3, respectively (Figure 1c,d). These results indicate that the growth of WXR-24 is also inhibited in liquid culture by AP-3 supplementation. 3.2. Cell Division Protein FtsZ is Predicted as a Target of AP-3 Since the growth of WXR-24 was inhibited by AP-3 supplementation, in order to understand the mechanism, it is necessary to identify the intracellular targets of AP-3. In eukaryotic cells, AP-3 binds to β-tubulin and consequently inhibits microtubule assembly and cell division [7]. Because tubulins are not present in A. pretiosum, it was therefore inferred that FtsZ, as a structural homolog to tubulin [23], is likely to be the intracellular target of AP-3. To confirm the hypothesis above, the two structures were compared. The structure of FtsZ in WXR-24 was simulated by homologous modeling based on the structure of FtsZ from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 5v68). The structure of β-tubulin was obtained from the maytansine-tubulin complex (PDB entry 4TV8, chain D). Both proteins consist of twelve α-helices spaced by ten β-sheets. The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the two proteins are divided by the featured α-helix 7 located horizontally in the middle of the proteins (Figure 2a,b). These two structures were further compared according to the flexible structure alignment algorithm [18]. The result showed that they are significantly similar with a p-value of 2.56 × 10−7 (raw score is 483.77). The two structures have 333 equivalent positions with an RMSD of 3.02, and 2 positions could not be completely aligned. Three large conserved blocks made up of the 333 equivalent positions are formed (colored in red, yellow or pink), which are separated by the two non-homologous positions (Figure 2c). In detail, structures from S1 to S10 (red, corresponding to amino acid residues 31–331 of FtsZ and 1–381 of β-tubulin), H11 (yellow, residues 347–357 of FtsZ and 382–400 of β-tubulin) and H12 (pink, residues 401–420 of FtsZ and 415–438 of β-tubulin) are highly similar between the two proteins, but structure between S10 and H11 and that between H11 and H12 could not be aligned (Figure 2d,e). In the superposition of FtsZ and β-tubulin, GDP pockets are located in similar positions of the two proteins (Figure 2e). Although most key amino acid residues in β-tubulin interacting with maytansine are absent in FtsZ (Figure 2d), similar structure of the maytansine-binding pocket still exists in FtsZ (Figure 2e). Based on these comparison, FtsZ was considered to be the intracellular target of AP-3. 3.3. In Vitro Interaction of FtsZ and AP-3 To test if AP-3 could bind to FtsZ, FtsZ protein from A. pretiosum WXR-24 was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified. The interaction of FtsZ with AP-3 was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor analysis. Before analysis, 6000 RU of FtsZ was immobilized on a CM5 chip, then AP-3 solutions with concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μM successively flew over the FtsZ conjugated surface. The injection of 6.25–100 μM AP-3 induced a gradually increased response of the FtsZ-bound surface, indicating a stable binding between FtsZ and AP-3 (Figure 3a). The binding ratio of FtsZ and AP-3 was 1:1, and the association rate and dissociation rate constants Ka and Kd were 2.36 × 103 M−1s−1 and 0.794 s-1, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant KD was 3.36 × 10-4 M (Table S4). Since the KD of AP-3 and β-tubulin is 1.3 ± 0.7 × 10-6 M [5], the binding of AP-3 to FtsZ was thought to be much weaker than the binding of AP-3 to β-tubulin. To study whether the supplementation of AP-3 affects FtsZ assembly, light scattering experiment was performed to monitor the real-time FtsZ assembly process. The supplementation of AP-3 had an obvious negative impact on in vitro FtsZ assembly (Figure 3b). GTPase activity of FtsZ was also studied under AP-3 supplementation. The GTPase activity of FtsZ was slightly decreased upon AP-3 addition (Figure 3c), suggesting that FtsZ assembly is inhibited by AP-3 binding in a GTPase-independent manner. 3.4. Docking Analysis of AP-3 on FtsZ Since AP-3 was confirmed to bind to FtsZ and inhibit FtsZ assembly, it is necessary to explore the interaction between AP-3 and FtsZ at the molecular level. For this purpose, docking analysis was performed around the putative maytansine-binding structure on FtsZ obtained from the structure comparison in Section 3.2. Fifteen independent runs were performed, generating 32 output conformations. Simulated conformation with the lowest energy of -19.47 kcal/mol was selected. AP-3 binding site is located near the N-terminal of α-helix 3, α-helix 4 and α-helix 5, and not far from the GDP pocket (Figure 4a). As shown in Figure 4b, the AP-3 binding site is at the edge of the junction region between two FtsZ monomers, which explains the inhibition of FtsZ assembly by AP-3 supplementation and the unaffected GTPase activity of FtsZ. Whereas the surface of FtsZ is highly hydrophilic, the AP-3 binding pocket is comprised of less hydrophilic amino acids (Figure 4c). The macrolactam ring of AP-3 is inserted into the hydrophobic pocket, and key amino acid residues of FtsZ interacting with AP-3 are identified as Pro92, His96, Gly129, Gln169 and Asn173. In detail, the carbinolamide ring of AP-3 is attached to the amine groups of Gln169 and Asn173 with hydrogen bonds, and the nearby oxygen atom on C-10 of AP-3 forms hydrogen bond with the amine group on His96. The other side of the macrolactam ring attaches to the pocket via hydrophobic interactions between the carbon skeleton of C14-C15 and Pro92 and Gly129 (Figure 4d). 3.5. Introducing an Extra Copy of ftsZ Improved AP-3 Resistance and Production Since FtsZ was identified as the target of AP-3, we hypothesized that its overexpression might be able to alleviate the toxicity of AP-3 to the growth of WXR-24. To test this, APASM_5716, coding for FtsZ in A. pretiosum, was overexpressed under the strong promoter kasOp* on the integrative plasmid pLQ646 (Figure S1). The resulting plasmid pLQ1913 was introduced into WXR-24 by conjugation, and the resulting strain was named as WXR-30. The transcriptional level of ftsZ had a 202% increase in WXR-30 (Figure S4). As shown in Figure S5, WXR-30 exhibited superior growth than WXR-24 during cultivation. Microscopic observation showed that, with the overexpression of ftsZ, the mycelial morphology of A. pretiosum was changed, the branches became shorter and the long hyphae intertwined with each other to form clumps (Figure S6). The resistance of WXR-30 was evaluated after 3 days of incubation, and the cell survive rate was 100% under supplementation of 100 mg/L AP-3. (Figure 5a,b and Table S2). With supplemented 200 mg/L AP-3, the survive rate of WXR-30 showed a slight decrease to 95%, which was obviously higher than that of WXR-24 under the same conditions (72%). Moreover, 14 and 8 colonies appeared on plates supplemented with 300 mg/L and 400 mg/L AP-3, respectively. After 16-day incubation, 1080 and 1302 colonies appeared on plates supplemented with 300 mg/L and 400 mg/L AP-3, respectively (Figure S3), which was 7-fold and 118-fold those of WXR-24 under the same conditions. In addition, the average colony sizes of WXR-30 decreased by 31% and 38% when supplemented with 100 and 200 mg/L of AP-3, respectively (Table S3), substantially lower than those of WXR-24 (38% and 66%), suggesting a better growth of WXR-30 under AP-3 supplementation conditions. Cell growth of WXR-30 in liquid medium was also studied. The initial OD600 of WXR-24 and WXR-30 were both 0.05. Whereas the final OD600 of WXR-24 was 0.11, the final OD600 of WXR-30 reached 0.21, showing a significantly improved growth of WXR-30 in liquid culture (Figure 5c). The effect of FtsZ overexpression on AP-3 production was also evaluated with WXR-30. Compared with the starting strain WXR-24, the yield of AP-3 for WXR-30 was increased by 31%, from 250.66 mg/L to 327.37 mg/L (Figure 5d). In addition, the concentrations of supplemented yeast extract were optimized with WXR-30. When 24 g/L yeast extract was used in the fermentation medium, the AP-3 yield of WXR-30 was further improved to 371.16 mg/L (Figure 5d and Figure S7), i.e., 48% higher than that of WXR-24.
