Results RpoS Attenuates Biofilm Metabolic Activity. Prior work has indicated that RpoS is active in biofilms and that it confers fitness during conditions of either carbon source or oxygen limitation in P. aeruginosa (36, 37). We therefore sought to test whether RpoS contributes to metabolic activity in macrocolony biofilms, which contain opposing oxygen and carbon-source gradients (38, 39). Our group has previously used stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy to map metabolic activity across biofilm depth and found that it is affected by growth conditions and genotype (31, 39). SRS microscopy is an optical imaging technique that detects the vibration of specific chemical bonds (40). For this method, we transfer mature biofilms onto medium containing deuterated water for 5 h before harvesting and preparing thin sections and then use SRS to detect the D-C bonds that arise from incorporation of deuterium into biomass (an indicator of metabolic activity) (Fig. 1A). We used this approach and observed two changes in ΔrpoS biofilms when compared to WT: i) a shift in the localization of maximum metabolic activity, from a depth of ~50 to 30 µm, and ii) an overall increase in metabolic activity over a broad region starting at a depth of about 50 µm and continuing toward the biofilm base (Fig. 1B).

The Methylated Phenazine Pyocyanin Supports Metabolic Activity across Depth in PA14 Biofilms. We have previously reported that phenazine production (Fig. 2A) enhances metabolic activity at depth in PA14 biofilms (31), and we therefore hypothesized that the effects of RpoS on biofilm metabolic activity could be mediated by effects on phenazine production. To test this, we used SRS microscopy to image biofilm thin sections from a ΔrpoSΔphz mutant, which is unable to produce phenazines. Removing the capacity to produce phenazines abolished the enhanced metabolic activity of the ΔrpoS parent strain, indicating that this phenotype is indeed phenazine-dependent (Fig. 2B). We note that the absence of phenazines did not affect the depth at which the maximum metabolic activity was detected in ΔrpoS biofilms. The localization of maximum metabolic activity may be affected by differences in oxygen consumption in ΔrpoS biofilms as we observed steeper oxygen gradients in this mutant background when compared to respective parent-strain backgrounds (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2.Biofilm metabolic activity at depth is supported specifically by the production of methylated phenazine derivatives. (A) The phenazine biosynthetic pathway. A series of enzymes convert two molecules of chorismate to phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). PCA can be aminated by PhzH to produce phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN) or methylated by PhzM to produce 5-methyl-PCA. Further modification of 5-methyl-PCA abiotically by free amine groups or enzymatically by PhzS produces aeruginosins (one example structure is shown) or pyocyanin (PYO), respectively.

Due to the importance of phenazines in the high metabolic activity of ΔrpoS biofilms, we investigated how RpoS affects the production of specific phenazine derivatives. P. aeruginosa phenazines are produced in biofilms and in the stationary phase during growth in shaken liquid cultures (41). The first derivative produced in the P. aeruginosa phenazine synthesis pathway is phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), which can be converted to i) phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN) via the PhzH transamidase, or ii) 5-methyl-PCA via the PhzM methyltransferase. 5-methyl-PCA, an unstable intermediate, is converted to other methylated phenazines including pyocyanin and aeruginosin A (42–44) (Fig. 2A). It has been reported that RpoS inhibits production of PhzM and that RpoS-deficient mutants show increased pyocyanin and decreased PCA production (29, 45). HPLC and spectrophotometer analysis of extracts from biofilms and the underlying growth medium confirmed that flux through the PhzM step of the phenazine biosynthetic pathway was increased in ΔrpoS biofilms (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, PCA levels in PA14 and ΔrpoS biofilms lacking the phenazine modification enzymes PhzH, PhzM, and PhzS (ΔphzHMS) were similar, providing further evidence that the changes in phenazine differentiation observed in ΔrpoS biofilms is due to changes in regulation of one or more enzyme(s) that modify PCA (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). To evaluate whether specific phenazine derivatives contribute to metabolic activity in biofilms and whether this underpins the ΔrpoS phenotype, we incubated mutant biofilms lacking genes for phenazine-modification enzymes on deuterated water, prepared thin sections, and imaged via SRS microscopy. We observed a clear correlation between the production of pyocyanin and the amount of metabolic activity across depth in biofilms, most notably in the hypoxic/anoxic zone. Consistent with the notion that one or more methylated phenazines promote metabolic activity, a strain (“BigBlue”) that contains a second copy of phzM on the chromosome (46) and therefore overproduces methylated phenazines (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B), showed the strongest SRS signal (Fig. 2E). Among the mutants we tested was ΔphzHS, which would be expected to produce increased levels of 5-methyl-PCA, aeruginosin A, and other abiotic 5-methyl-PCA derivatives (relative to WT) without producing pyocyanin. Interestingly, ΔphzHS biofilms exhibited an SRS profile that resembled that of ΔphzHMS biofilms, showing that specific disruption of pyocyanin synthesis abolishes metabolic activity in the biofilm anoxic zone. By adding endogenous pyocyanin to mature biofilms, we also found that this methylated phenazine is sufficient to promote metabolic activity at depth (Fig. 2F). In addition, since PCN is the most abundant phenazine in macrocolony biofilms (Fig. 2D) (41), we tested the effect of this compound on metabolic activity. In contrast to our observations for pyocyanin, our results for engineered strains with altered PCN production and for biofilms exposed to PCN indicated that this phenazine does not contribute to metabolic activity at depth in biofilms (Fig. 2 E and F). RpoS Regulates Phenazine Derivatization Via the P. aeruginosa Carbon Catabolite Repression System. We sought to further understand the regulatory pathway that allows RpoS to control phenazine methylation. The phzM transcript is one of >200 mRNA targets of the Hfq/Crc (“catabolite repression control”) protein complex (Fig. 3A) (47–50). The Hfq/Crc complex mediates the terminal regulatory step of the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) pathway. Canonically, the CCR pathway acts to inhibit translation of mRNAs that support the use of nonpreferred carbon sources when preferred substrates are available (51, 52), though recent studies have indicated that it has broad effects on P. aeruginosa physiology beyond primary metabolic functions (53–55). Consistent with the notion that RpoS acts via this pathway to control phenazine methylation, a recent study (45) found that the translation of phzM is inhibited by RpoS. To further probe this model, we created Δcrc and ΔrpoSΔcrc mutants and measured phenazine production by biofilms. We found that like ΔrpoS biofilms, Δcrc and ΔrpoSΔcrc biofilms show enhanced production of methylated phenazines (Fig. 3B). Δcrc biofilms differ from ΔrpoS biofilms in that they do not show a substantial decrease in PCA and PCN production compared to WT. This indicates that although both Hfq/Crc and RpoS have global regulatory effects (18, 50), the impact of Crc on nonmethylated phenazines is negligible or small compared to that of RpoS. RpoS affects the expression of over 700 genes (18), one or more of which likely has downstream effects on the production of the nonmethylated phenazines. Fig. 3.RpoS inhibits phenazine methylation by modulating the carbon catabolite repression pathway at the biofilm-air interface. (A) Schematic of the P. aeruginosa carbon catabolite repression pathway, which controls translation of phzM in a carbon source-dependent manner. RpoN is the canonical sigma factor that is associated with this pathway and it acts in conjunction with the transcription factor CbrB. When CrcZ levels are low, the Crc/Hfq complex binds to phzM transcript and inhibits translation. When CrcZ levels are high, CrcZ binds and sequesters Crc/Hfq, allowing translation of the phzM transcript.

Average fluorescence across depth of a representative biofilm section is shown in the right-hand plot. RpoS Inhibits crcZ Expression. Binding of the Hfq/Crc complex to target transcripts can be prevented by the small RNA CrcZ (Fig. 3A), which itself can bind and thereby sequester Hfq/Crc under appropriate conditions. This regulatory mechanism allows for condition-dependent translation of Hfq/Crc targets (52). RpoS could therefore affect Hfq/Crc activity by modulating transcription of either crcZ or crc. To test this, we created constructs in which the upstream promoter regions of crcZ or crc are cloned in front of mScarlet (PcrcZ and Pcrc, respectively) and then placed these in a neutral site on the chromosome in WT and ΔrpoS backgrounds. We found that in both biofilms and liquid (planktonic) cultures, removal of RpoS did not affect activity of Pcrc, but, in contrast, led to a strong enhancement of PcrcZ activity (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). This indicates that RpoS inhibits crcZ expression, possibly by competing with RpoN for RNA polymerase (56) (Fig. 3A) or another more indirect mechanism. The resource gradients that form across depth in macrocolony biofilms lead to physiological differentiation and subpopulations with distinct patterns of gene expression (2, 4, 5, 26, 57). RpoS-dependent effects on gene expression could be localized to a specific biofilm subzone, perhaps where this activity would be most physiologically relevant. Indeed, results from previous studies suggest that RpoS is most expressed and active at the P. aeruginosa biofilm–air interface (26, 27, 58, 59). Moreover, pyocyanin synthesis requires oxygen, and prior work by our group has indicated that production of 5-Me-PCA may also be limited to oxygen-containing biofilm subzones (60). When we prepared thin sections of WT and ΔrpoS biofilms expressing PcrcZ-mScarlet and imaged by fluorescence microscopy, we found that the effect of RpoS on crcZ expression was indeed localized to the biofilm-air interface (Fig. 3D), similar to what has been observed for direct RpoS targets such as the promoter for coxB (26, 38). The observation that RpoS inhibits crcZ expression specifically at the biofilm-air interface, which is the biofilm region furthest from the growth medium, is consistent with a role for RpoS and the CCR system in inhibiting methylated phenazine production. Because phenazines are excreted small molecules with the potential to diffuse through the biofilm, changes in phenazine derivatization due to changes in RpoS activity at the biofilm surface can negatively impact metabolic activity at depth in biofilms (Fig. 1B). Evidence suggests that crcZ transcription in P. aeruginosa is driven directly by the regulator CbrB and the sigma factor RpoN (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B) (24, 52, 61). CbrB is part of the CbrAB two-component system, which responds to an as-yet-unidentified cue. Our observation that RpoS inhibits crcZ transcription raised the question of whether RpoS might be acting upstream of CbrAB. To test this, we deleted cbrB in the ΔrpoS PcrcZ-mScarlet reporter strain and found that this abolished PcrcZ activity (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B). These results indicate that CbrB is required for crcZ repression in the ΔrpoS background and are consistent with a model in which RpoS acts upstream of CbrAB, the first apparent step of the P. aeruginosa CCR pathway, to inhibit phzM translation and therefore methylated phenazine production. In other words, RpoS might inhibit CbrB-induced crcZ expression, leading to a larger pool of unsequestered Crc available to bind phzM transcript, and therefore lower levels of phzM translation in the WT when compared to ΔrpoS. CCR-pathway Mutant Phentoypes Are Consistent with Roles of the Pathway in Regulating PhzM Translation and Carbon Source Utilization. Our observations linking RpoS to the CCR pathway and the inhibition of metabolic activity in biofilms suggest that RpoN, which is required for crcZ expression, could promote metabolic activity in biofilms. We addressed this by imaging thin sections of WT and ΔrpoN biofilms via SRS microscopy and found that ΔrpoN biofilms showed lower levels of metabolic activity across depth than those formed by the WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). This observation is consistent with RpoN’s role in the CCR pathway and the abrogation of methylated phenazine production in this mutant (47, 62). A second prediction that arises from the fact that RpoS inhibits crcZ expression (Fig. 3D) is that RpoS might hinder P. aeruginosa’s ability to transition to growth on nonpreferred carbon sources, as crcZ relieves Crc/Hfq repression of target mRNAs involved in the use of these substrates (63). To test this idea, we used a defined liquid growth medium with a highly preferred carbon source (i.e., succinate, on which P. aeruginosa shows low levels of crcZ expression) or with a nonpreferred carbon source (i.e., mannitol, which induces high levels of crcZ expression) (64). We found that the ΔrpoS mutant indeed showed a large increase in crcZ expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), and enhanced growth during the lag and exponential phases (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), during growth on mannitol when compared to WT. During growth on succinate, ΔrpoS did not show a large increase in crcZ expression or enhanced growth during the lag or exponential phases of growth. The ΔrpoS mutant did, however, show an increased growth yield relative to WT during growth on succinate, which may arise from independent effects of this mutation. Due to its role in stabilizing Hfq’s interaction with target transcripts such as that of phzM, mutants lacking Crc overproduce PhzM and methylated phenazines (47, 65) (Fig. 3B). Having observed that ΔrpoS and BigBlue—two mutants with elevated methylated phenazine production—show increased metabolic activity at depth in biofilms, we wondered whether this correlation would extend to the Δcrc mutant. We used SRS microscopy to image Δcrc and ΔphzΔcrc biofilm thin sections and found that the Δcrc mutant also showed increased metabolic activity across depth in a phenazine-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4.Like rpoS, crc dampens phenazine-supported metabolic activity but contributes to phenazine resistance. (A) SRS images of thin sections prepared from WT, Δcrc, and ΔcrcΔphz biofilms.

The phenotypes we observed for the ΔrpoS (Fig. 1B) and Δcrc mutants indicate that RpoS and Hfq/Crc inhibit physiological processes–leading to decreased metabolic activity and growth–raising the question of whether RpoS and Hfq/Crc activity have any benefits for PA14 under the conditions used here. In other words, do RpoS and/or Hfq/Crc have positive impacts that outweigh their inhibition of metabolic activity and growth? Because previous work has shown that pyocyanin can be toxic to P. aeruginosa under specific conditions (33), we sought to test whether RpoS and/or Hfq/Crc may protect P. aeruginosa from potential negative effects of phenazines. We took three approaches to testing whether RpoS and/or Hfq/Crc mitigate the toxicity of phenazines. First, we plated the WT and the Δcrc and ΔrpoS mutants on medium containing the synthetic compound phenazine methosulfate (PMS). PMS is structurally similar to the methylated phenazines produced by P. aeruginosa and we have shown that other mechanisms of P. aeruginosa self-protection are active against this compound (34, 35). We found that Δcrc, but not ΔrpoS, showed a greater inhibition of growth by PMS than the WT (Fig. 4B). The Δcrc phenotype is in line with previous work in P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, which indicated that the Δcrc mutation affects redox homeostasis, tolerance of oxidizing agents, and expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response (66). In the absence of Crc, target mRNAs whose translation would be repressed by Hfq/Crc in the wild-type background are translated. Evidence suggests that these include proteins that carry out steps in the Entner-Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathways and that their increased levels in Δcrc lead to effects on redox balancing. In the ΔrpoS background, RpoS-dependent effects on crcZ levels are absent but Crc is still present, and it is possible that other regulators modulate crcZ levels to allow Crc to contribute to oxidative stress resistance in the presence of PMS. In our second approach, we grew WT and mutant biofilms under standard conditions before harvesting, homogenizing, and plating for colony-forming units (CFUs). We found that ΔrpoS and Δcrc biofilms contain ~50% fewer CFUs than their WT counterparts and that this effect is partially reversed in the phenazine-null background (Fig. 4C). In our third and final approach, we sought to identify which biofilm region may benefit most from RpoS and/or Crc activity. We incubated mature biofilms on medium containing propidium iodide (PI), a dye that shows increased staining in biofilm regions with low viability. We observed increased staining at the biofilm-air interface in ΔrpoS biofilms when compared to those formed by the WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). This result is in line with our observation that RpoS inhibits crcZ expression specifically in this zone. Taken together, our findings highlight the long-range effects of localized sigma factor activity and metabolite production on the metabolism and survival of physiologically differentiated subpopulations in biofilms.
