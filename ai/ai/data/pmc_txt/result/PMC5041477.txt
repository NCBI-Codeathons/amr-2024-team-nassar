RESULTS CPT resistant mutant Top1 are defective in nucleolar delocalization To investigate the impact of CPT on the nuclear dynamics of human Top1 (see the domain structure, Figure 1A) in live cells, we ectopically expressed wild-type (WT) EGFP-tagged nuclear Top1 (EGFP–Top1WT) and its mutant variants such as catalytically inactive mutant (EGFP–Top1Y723F), CPT-resistant mutant (EGFP–Top1N722S) in the C-terminal domain and N-terminal mutant (EGFP–Top1W205G) in HCT116 cells. We confirmed the expression of all the chimeric EGFP–Top1 variants by western blotting using anti-GFP antibody (Figure 1B). Top1 specific antibodies (Figure 1C), detect EGFP–Top1 variants as an additional band of slower migration (117 kDa) and with similar intensity as compared with endogenous Top1 (91 kDa), suggesting that the ectopic Top1 variants were not over expressed. Cells transfected with EGFP empty vector failed to show the additional band (Figure 1C, lane 5). We confirmed the colocalization of the ectopic EGFP–Top1 with the nucleoli by double-immunostaining with an antibody specific against nucleolin (17,18,24). Figure 1D shows that in absence of CPT, EGFP–Top1WT was predominantly confined to the nucleolus, while CPT treatment markedly accumulate Top1 in the nucleoplasm (Figure 1D, panel CPT). Next, we followed the subnuclear distribution of the ectopic EGFP–Top1 variants using live cell confocal microscopy. CPT treatment delocalized Top1 (EGFP–Top1WT) from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in 85–90% of cells (Figure 1E, panel EGFP–Top1WT + CPT, see the quantification in Figure 1F), which is consistent with the earlier reports (18,23,24,56). Interestingly, under similar conditions, CPT failed to delocalize EGFP–Top1Y723F in 65–75% of cells (Figure 1E, panel EGFP–Top1Y723F + CPT, and the quantification in Figure 1F) and EGFP–Top1N722S in 70–85% of cells from the nucleoli to nucleoplasm (Figure 1E, panel EGFP–Top1N722S
+ CPT, and the quantification in Figure 1F). However, EGFP–Top1W205G showed CPT-induced partial re-distribution in the nucleoplasm (Figure 1E, panel EGFP–Top1W205G+ CPT, see the quantification in Figure 1F), suggesting that Top1 subnuclear rearrangements depend on CPT-sensitive Top1 activity. To elucidate the mechanistic link between nuclear dynamics, catalytic activity and CPT sensitivity of Top1 variants, we tested them in plasmid DNA relaxation assays (53–55). We IP ectopic EGFP–Top1 and its mutants using anti-GFP antibody (Figure 2A) and the immune complexes were used as source of Top1 (EGFP–Top1WT, EGFP–Top1Y723F, EGFP–Top1N722S or EGFP–Top1W205G) for the time course DNA relaxation experiments (Figure 2B–F) in the presence or absence of CPT. As expected, no plasmid relaxation activity was observed with the IgG-control beads (Figure 2B) or catalytically inactive Top1 (EGFP–Top1Y723F) (Figure 2D). In the absence of CPT, EGFP–Top1WT relaxes supercoiled DNA at a similar rate as that of EGFP–Top1N722S and EGFP–Top1W205G (Figure 2C, E and F, panel (−) CPT). Under similar condition, the rate of plasmid DNA relaxation by EGFP–Top1WT was inhibited by CPT in a time dependent manner (see Figure 2C, panel (+) CPT and quantification in Figure 2G), whereas the drug has a reduced effect (∼2-fold) on the rate of relaxation by EGFP–Top1W205G (compare CPT-induced DNA relaxation inhibition (%) by WT versus W205G with time in Figure 2G), which may account for the abrogation of CPT-induced nucleolar delocalization in live cell microscopy (Figure 1E, panel CPT + EGFP–Top1W205G). Under similar conditions CPT failed to inhibit the DNA relaxation activity by EGFP–Top1N722S (Figure 2E and G). We therefore conclude that the molecular interactions of CPT with Top1–DNA cleavage complexes (Top1cc) drive or limit the mobility of Top1 in the nuclear compartments. Figure 2.Effect of CPT on the plasmid DNA relaxation activity of EGFP–Top1 variants. (A) EGFP-tagged wild-type (WT) and mutant (Y723F, N722S, W205G) Top1 constructs were ectopically expressed in HCT116 cells and were immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-GFP antibody.

FRAP kinetic modelling shows accumulation of CPT-induced immobile Top1 in the nucleus The FRAP techniques offer an effective tool to study the in vivo mobility of cellular proteins (47). To examine the FRAP kinetic properties of Top1 (EGFP–Top1WT) and the impact of CPT in living cells, we ectopically expressed EGFP–Top1 variants and analysed the same under a spinning disc confocal laser microscope (Figure 3A). We further utilized mathematical modelling (48,49) to estimate the quantitative parameters, such as the diffusion coefficient and immobile fractions of Top1 induced by CPT (Table 1). Figure 3.CPT accumulates immobile/bound Top1 in the nucleus. (A) Cartoon representing live cells Top1 dynamics in the presence and absence of CPT. Fluorescence tagged-human Top1 was evaluated with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technology. Cells exhibit mainly two types of fluorescent molecules: mobile (unbound) and immobile (bound) (as indicated in the cartoon). After photobleaching at a region of interest (ROI) cells exhibit bleached molecules (grey). Exchanges occur between the mobile parts of two compartments. Top1 cleaves one strand of duplex DNA via the nucleophilic attack of its active site tyrosine (Y723) on the DNA phosphodiester backbone to yield a 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond. The short-lived covalent Top1–DNA cleavage complex (reversible Top1cc) is readily reversed by a second transesterification reaction in which the 5′-hydroxyl end acts as a nucleophile to religate the DNA and to free Top1 (No CPT). Top1 poisons i.e. CPT binds in the interface of Top1–DNA complex, stabilizes Top1cc (Top1 bound state/immobile) and inhibits the Top1-religation reaction. Bold arrow indicates the shift in the cleavage/religation equilibrium (3), with increasing population of bound/immobile fraction, fluorescence exchange rate is reduced in FRAP recoveries. (B) Representative images showing the FRAP of WT Top1 (EGFP–Top1WT) transiently expressed in HCT116 cells and their response to indicated CPT concentrations (1–10 μM). Cells expressing the ectopic proteins were kept untreated or treated with CPT (indicated) for 10 min and were analysed by live cell spinning disk confocal microscopy and photobleaching. A sub‐nuclear spot (ROI) indicated by a circle was bleached (BLH) for 30 ms and photographed at regular intervals of 3 ms thereafter. Successive images taken for ∼90 s after bleaching illustrate fluorescence return into the bleached areas.

Estimation of diffusion constants and bound/immobile fraction of EGFP-tagged wild-type (WT) and mutant (Y723F, N722S, W205G) Top1 from FRAP recovery studies TOP1 variants Treatment Bound(immobile) fraction Diffusion constant (μm2/s).

Normalized fluorescence intensities after photobleaching were fitted into the equation Equation 1 (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section for details) to quantitate bound/immobile fraction and diffusion constant of Top1 variants in the absence or presence Top1 poison (CPT), PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) and combination of ABT-888 + CPT. Quantification are based on mean FRAP data (n = 15). In absence of CPT, the FRAP recovery curves revealed two populations of EGFP–Top1WT: a mobile population representing ∼80–85% of the total and a smaller (∼15–20%) immobile population (see Figure 3B, and the quantification in 3C; No CPT), indicating that Top1 is mobile in the nucleus under steady state and were exchanged promptly between nuclear compartments. However, EGFP–Top1 shows slower recovery than EGFP alone (Supplementary Figure S1A, showing free diffusion of EGFP), suggesting that the Top1 is not freely diffusible. During DNA relaxation, Top1 binds DNA non-covalently followed by transient covalent binding (reversible Top1cc; Figure 3A) and finally religation of the DNA strand and release of the enzyme (2,13), which plausibly contributes to the (∼15–20%) immobile Top1 population in the FRAP recovery curves (Figure 3B). However in the presence of CPT (1 μM), Top1 is covalently trapped on the DNA (Figure 3A; CPT), which significantly blocks FRAP recovery by increasing ∼35–40% of Top1 immobile population in the nucleoplasm (Figure 3B, and the quantification in 3C; (+) CPT) as well as in the nucleolus (Supplementary Figure S1B). Fluorescence recovery of Top1 was further retarded by ∼40–55% with increasing dose of CPT (Figure 3B and C). The dissociation timescale of covalently bound complexes (irreversible Top1cc) in the presence of CPT are normally high and does not contribute to the FRAP recovery process. Therefore, we assume that CPT-induced immobile/bound fraction is exclusively due to the formation of Top1cc in the live cell nucleus (Figure 3A; CPT). To further test this possibility, we performed the fluorescence recovery of Top1 inactive mutant (EGFP–Top1Y723F), which shows no significant variation in the mobile fraction of Top1Y723F either in the presence or absence of CPT (Supplementary Figure S1C, and the quantification in supplementary Figure 1D). Next, kinetic modelling was applied to fit the complete set of Top1–FRAP data that best approximate the experimental dynamics (Supplementary Figures S2 and 3) and this yields an estimated CPT-induced bound/immobile fraction, mobile fraction and the diffusion rate of Top1. The diffusion coefficient for all the Top1 variants were comparable, suggesting no gross change in the diffusion rate of Top1 due to its point mutations (Table 1). However, we observed a marked accumulation (∼2-fold increase) of CPT-induced in vivo Top1cc (Table 1, WT), absent in the inactive mutant Top1Y723F (Table 1, Y723F), which is in agreement with the CPT mediated inhibition of the in vitro plasmid DNA relaxation activity (Figure 2C, panel WT (+) CPT). Together these results provide evidence that CPT impairs Top1 mobility and induce Top1cc (Figure 3) in the nucleus. Top1-mutants (W205G and N722S) abrogate CPT-induced Top1 immobile fraction Because Top1-mutants (N722S and W205G) were completely or partially resistant to CPT in the plasmid DNA relaxation assays (see Figure 2E and F, panel (+) CPT), we further investigated the FRAP kinetics of both EGFP–Top1N722S and EGFP–Top1W205G in the live cell's nucleus. As expected, we observed no significant variation in the fluorescence recovery of EGFP–Top1N722S in the presence or absence of CPT (Figure 4A and B). This is in complete agreement with the estimated bound fraction of Top1N722S in the presence or absence of CPT (Table 1, N722S; fittings of the FRAP data shown in Supplementary Figure S4), and accounts for resistance to CPT-induced dynamic mobility of Top1N722S in the nuclear compartments (Figure 1E and F). Figure 4.Top1 W205 and N722 residues are critical for CPT-induced nuclear dynamics.

Successive images taken for ∼90 s after bleaching illustrate fluorescence return into the bleached areas. Right panels (B and D) quantification of FRAP data showing mean curves of Top1 variants in the presence and absence of CPT. Error bars represent mean ± S.E. (n = 15). Interestingly, in absence of CPT, Top1W205G mutant shows faster rate of fluorescence recovery (∼85–90% of the total within 30 s, Figure 4D) indicating a significant increase in the mobile population when compared with the fluorescence recovery of the EGFP–Top1WT (70–80% at 30 s) (compare Figure 4D with 3C). However, CPT fails to trap Top1W205G on DNA with an estimated reduction of ∼1.5–2-fold in the CPT-induced bound/immobile Top1W205G compared to Top1WT (Table 1, compare WT versus W205G; fittings of Top1W205G-FRAP data shown in Supplementary Figure S5), which may account for CPT-induced partial nucleolar delocalization (Figure 1E and F). Therefore our live cell analyses provide new evidence suggesting Trp205 and Asn722 regulate CPT-induced nuclear dynamics of Top1. (ADP)ribose polymers regulate Top1 subnuclear distribution Top1 is heavily PARylated when trapped on DNA in the presence of CPT or due to DNA breaks associated with endogenous DNA damage, chromosomal transactions or DNA lesions (26,30,57). To determine the functional relationship between PAR polymers and Top1 dynamics, we tested the impact of the PARP inhibitor (veliparib, ABT-888) in the absence or presence of CPT under live cells microscopy. Top1 dynamics was determined under conditions that blocked cellular PAR formation (31,32). Figure 5A shows that in absence of ABT-888, EGFP–Top1WT was predominantly confined to the nucleolus as shown in Figure 1D. ABT-888 only, delocalized Top1 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in 55–65% of cells (Figure 5A, panel WT + ABT-888 and the quantification in Figure 5B). However, ABT-888 failed to delocalize Top1Y723F and Top1N722S in 70–80% of cells (Figure 5A, panel Y723F or N722S + ABT-888 and the quantification in Figure 5B) like CPT (Figure 1E). Co-treatment of ABT-888 + CPT, shows similar impact on nuclear localization of Top1Y723F and EGFP–Top1N722S as observed independently with CPT (Figure 5A, panels Y723F and N722S; quantification in Figure 5B). In contrast, ABT-888 or co-treatment with ABT-888 + CPT induces significant delocalization of Top1 mutants (EGFP–Top1W205G) from the nucleoli to nucleoplasm (Figure 5A; panel W205G and the quantification in Figure 5B), suggesting PAR polymers recruit Top1 in the nucleolus (Figure 1). Figure 5.(ADP)ribose polymers regulate Top1 subnuclear distribution. (A) Representative live cell images showing nucleolar delocalization of ectopic EGFP–Top1WT when treated with PARP inhibitor (ABT-888; 10 μM for 30 min) or combination of CPT + ABT-888 (10 μM each for 30 min) in HCT116 cells. EGFP–Top1 mutant variants: EGFP–Top1Y723F, EGFP–Top1N722S, EGFP–Top1W205G show differential nuclear dynamics in presence of PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) or combination of CPT + ABT-888 under live cell confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). (B) Densitometry analysis of delocalization of EGFP–Top1 variants (shown in panel A) from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in the presence and absence of indicated drug treatment.

Error bars represent mean ± S.E. (n = 60). (C) Detection of CPT-induced PARylation of ectopic Top1. EGFP-tagged WT and mutant (Y723F, N722S, W205G) Top1 constructs were ectopically expressed in HCT116 cells. Following treatment with 10 μM CPT for 2 h, EGFP–Top1 was IP using anti-GFP antibody and the immune complexes were probed with anti-PAR and anti-PARP1 antibody. Blots were subsequently stripped and probed with anti-GFP antibody to detect equal loading of ectopic EGFP-tagged Top1 variants. Aliquots (10%) of the input show the uniform presence of PARP1 prior to immunoprecipitation. Protein molecular weight markers (kDa) are indicated at right. Control immunoprecipitation with anti-IgG antibody demonstrates the specificity of the reactions. Note: PAR signal was observed with a prominent band ∼120 kDa, consistent with PARylation of ectopic EGFP–Top1 as indicated. (ADP)ribose polymers regulate Top1 subnuclear distribution. (A) Representative live cell images showing nucleolar delocalization of ectopic EGFP–Top1WT when treated with PARP inhibitor (ABT-888; 10 μM for 30 min) or combination of CPT + ABT-888 (10 μM each for 30 min) in HCT116 cells. EGFP–Top1 mutant variants: EGFP–Top1Y723F, EGFP–Top1N722S, EGFP–Top1W205G show differential nuclear dynamics in presence of PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) or combination of CPT + ABT-888 under live cell confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). (B) Densitometry analysis of delocalization of EGFP–Top1 variants (shown in panel A) from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in the presence and absence of indicated drug treatment. The percentage of cells displaying nucleolar fluorescence was determined from at least 60–70 cells expressing individual EGFP–Top1 constructs (WT, Y723F, N722S, W205G) in the absence and presence of drugs. Error bars represent mean ± S.E. (n = 60). (C) Detection of CPT-induced PARylation of ectopic Top1. EGFP-tagged WT and mutant (Y723F, N722S, W205G) Top1 constructs were ectopically expressed in HCT116 cells. Following treatment with 10 μM CPT for 2 h, EGFP–Top1 was IP using anti-GFP antibody and the immune complexes were probed with anti-PAR and anti-PARP1 antibody. Blots were subsequently stripped and probed with anti-GFP antibody to detect equal loading of ectopic EGFP-tagged Top1 variants. Aliquots (10%) of the input show the uniform presence of PARP1 prior to immunoprecipitation. Protein molecular weight markers (kDa) are indicated at right. Control immunoprecipitation with anti-IgG antibody demonstrates the specificity of the reactions. Note: PAR signal was observed with a prominent band ∼120 kDa, consistent with PARylation of ectopic EGFP–Top1 as indicated. Because Top1 is a part of PARP1 complexes (26,27) and ABT-888 induces delocalization of Top1 to the nucleoplasm (Figure 5A and B), therefore, the next question was whether the differential nuclear dynamics of EGFP–Top1N722S is due to its deficiency in the formation of PARP1–Top1 complex or PARylation of Top1N722S. To further examine these possibilities, we co-IP ectopic EGFP–Top1 variants in cells treated with CPT. PARP1 was readily detected in all the immunoprecipitates independent of Top1 mutations (Figure 5C). Under these conditions, PAR signal was observed with a prominent band of ∼120 kDa, consistent with PARylation of ectopic EGFP–Top1 (Figure 5C). However, under similar conditions we detected limited PAR signal in the co-immunoprecipitates of EGFP–Top1N722S (Figure 5C, top panel, fifth lane) compared to other Top1 variants (Top1WT or Top1W205G) as measured by western blotting. Therefore, the attenuation in the subnuclear rearrangement of the Top1N722S mutant in response to CPT + ABT-888 is not due to its inability to form PARP1–Top1 complexes but due to its deficiency in accumulation of PAR polymers (Figure 5C, N722S), which is in agreement with the decreased PAR signal on the catalytically inactive Top1 (Top1Y723F) (Figure 5C, top panel, third lane). Taken together, these results suggest that PAR polymers regulate Top1 dynamics in the nucleus. PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) enhance CPT-induced Top1 trapping on the DNA Because PARP inhibitors (ABT-888) efflux Top1 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (Figure 5A), we investigated the potential involvement of PAR polymers on Top1 trapping on DNA using FRAP experiments in cells treated with PARP inhibitors and/or in combination with CPT (Figure 6). FRAP kinetics of EGFP–Top1WT in the presence of ABT-888 (Figure 6A and B) was determined under conditions that blocked cellular PAR formation (31,32). In the presence of ABT-888, Top1 shows faster rate of fluorescence recovery similar to untreated condition (70–80%) at early times (30 s), however between 50 and 90 s we observed small but significant reduction (∼5–8%) in the ABT-888 induced mobile population of Top1 (Figure 6B). The impact was more dramatic with combination of CPT + ABT-888 compared to CPT alone (Figure 6A and B) as evidenced by marked reduction (25–30%) in the mobile fraction of EGFP–Top1WT (Figure 6C). FRAP kinetic modelling shows CPT + ABT-888 markedly increased (∼2-fold) the bound/immobile fraction of Top1 (Top1cc) compared to CPT alone (fittings of FRAP data are shown in Supplementary Figure S2 and estimated values are shown in Table 1; WT).

(C) Quantification of bound Top1cc calculated from the FRAP of ectopic EGFP-tagged WT and mutant (Y723F, N722S, W205G) Top1 constructs in the presence of indicated drugs. Percentage of FRAP recovery was estimated after 60 s normalized with FRAP recovery with no treatment. Bound fraction of all Top1 variants were plotted as function of drug treatment [CPT (1 μM) or ABT-888 (1 μM) or combination of CPT + ABT-888 (1 μM each) for 10 min]. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. The impact of ABT-888 + CPT combination on prolonged Top1 trapping was further rationalized by the deficiencies in FRAP recoveries for Top1 mutants (EGFP–Top1Y723F and EGFP–Top1N722S), which failed to show the accumulation of Top1 bound fractions (see the FRAP quantitation in Figure 6C) in the presence of ABT-888 + CPT (fittings of FRAP data are shown in Supplementary Figure S3 and 4 and the estimated values are shown in Table 1; Y723F and N722S). Consistent with the resistance of EGFP–Top1W205G to form CPT-induced Top1–DNA covalent complexes in the plasmid relaxation assays (Figure 2F) and FRAP kinetic modelling (Supplementary Figure S5 and estimated values are shown in Table 1; W205G), ABT-888 failed to markedly increase the CPT-induced bound/immobile fraction of EGFP–Top1W205G in FRAP recoveries (Figure 6C). Taken together, these results indicate that PAR polymers indeed counteract CPT-induced stabilization of Top1cc in the live cell nucleus.
