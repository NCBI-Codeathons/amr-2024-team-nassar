Results Identification and characterization of ede BGC in B. brevis X23 Brevibacillus brevis X23 was initially isolated in our lab as a biocontrol agent (Table S1), which produces edeines A and B against the plant pathogen causing tobacco bacteria wilt (Lu, 2014). The genome of B. brevis X23 was sequenced on the PacBio sequencing platform and submitted to NCBI (accession number: NZ_CP023474.1) (Chen et al., 2012). Based on antiSMASH (Blin et al., 2017) and Big‐SCAPE (Navarro‐Muñoz et al., 2020) analyses, 12 potential secondary metabolite BGCs were identified, one of which showed high sequence similarity to the predicted ede BGC of B. brevis Vm4 reported by Westman et al., (2013) (Fig. 2A). The identified ede BGC in B. brevis X23 shared the same organization as that in the B. brevis Vm4 genome. Briefly, the ede BGC (45.1 kb) in B. brevis X23 consisted of 17 open reading frames, designated edeA to edeQ according to the homologous sequences in B. brevis Vm4 (Fig. 2A).

Mass spectrogram of edeines A and B, in which the molecular ions [M + H]+ were 755.4415 and 797.4623 respectively. While the ede BGC was identified in B. brevis Vm4 based on bioinformatics prediction (Westman et al., 2013), no functional studies have yet been conducted. To confirm whether the predicted ede BGC was responsible for the biosynthesis of edeines, we knocked out the promoter region and the starter module edeP (RS18545) of the ede operon to generate the mutant strain B. brevis X23Δede (Fig. 2B and C). Then, both the wild‐type X23 (X23‐WT) and mutant strains were subjected to antimicrobial activity and comparative metabolomic analyses. The X23‐WT strain exhibited considerable antimicrobial activities against Ralstonia solanacearum and B. subtilis in the plate assay. However, the X23Δede culture supernatant had completely lost antimicrobial ability against R. solanacearum (Fig. 2D‐1) and B. subtilis (Fig. 2D‐2). High‐performance liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry (HPLC‐MS) analysis demonstrated abolished production of edeines A and B in the crude extract of the supernatant of X23Δede culture compared with X23‐WT (Fig. 2E and F). Taken together, these results suggested that the identified ede BGC was responsible for the production of antibiotic edeines A and B in B. brevis X23. Construction of promoter‐engineered B. brevis X23 strains The present study showed that all the edeine biosynthetic genes in B. brevis Vm4 (edeA‐edeP) were present on the same ede operon, which shared a single promoter, Pede (Fig. 3). Therefore, we hypothesized that it would be possible to improve the expression of the edeine BGC by replacing the original promoter Pede with stronger promoters. Thus, six strong promoters that are commonly used in B. brevis and B. subtilis, including three constitutive promoters (Pshuttle‐09 (Yang et al., 2013), P43 (Ye et al., 1999) and Pmwp (Mizukami et al., 2010)) and three inducer‐free promoters from inducible promoters (PxylA (Kim et al., 1996), Pgrac (Phan et al., 2006) and Pspc (Yansura and Henner, 1984)) generated by removing the repressor protein component, were selected to replace the original Pede promoter to improve edeine production (Tables S2 and S3). By double‐crossover homologous recombination via temperature‐sensitive integration vectors (Fig. S1) carrying the homologous regions from upstream and downstream of the Pede region of X23‐WT, the original promoter Pede was replaced with either one of the abovementioned six promoters (Fig. 3). The transformants were first identified by PCR (Fig. S2) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The transformants were designated X23 (Pede::Pmwp), X23 (Pede::PxylA), X23 (Pede::P43), X23 (Pede::Pshuttle‐09), X23 (Pede::Pgrac) and X23 (Pede::Pspc).

Promoter substitutions affected the growth of B. brevis X23 To evaluate the effects of promoter substitution on the growth of B. brevis, we compared the growth curves of the X23‐WT and its six promoter‐engineered strains by measuring the OD600 of the corresponding culture broths every 12 h (Fig. 4A). No significant difference in cell density was identified between the transformants and the X23‐WT strain at 12 h (exponential phase) and 24 h (stationary phase) of cultivation. However, the cell turbidity (OD600) of the six promoter‐engineered strains was 7.5–15.3% lower than that of the X23‐WT at 36 and 48 h (decline phase) (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the promoter substitution affected both the growth and biomass of B. brevis X23. The results also revealed that the increased antimicrobial activity observed was not due to the biomass increment. Fig. 4Growth curves of X23‐WT and promoter‐engineered B. brevis strains.A.

Promoter substitutions significantly improved the antibacterial activity of B. brevis X23 Given that ede BGC disruption abolished the antibacterial activity of B. brevis, we speculated that edeines were the major antibacterial substances in fermentation supernatants of X23‐WT when cultured in NB media. Thus, the yield of edeines was roughly consistent with the antimicrobial activity of B. brevis X23. Although edeines have broad inhibitory activity against Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria, B. subtilis was chosen to evaluate the antibacterial activity of all B. brevis strains because it exhibited the highest sensitivity to edeines based on our previous results (Lu, 2014). Therefore, to evaluate the effects of promoter substitutions on the yield of edeines, we first performed plate inhibition assay to assess the antibacterial activity of X23‐WT and six promoter‐engineered strains against B. subtilis 168 after 6, 9, 12, 24, 36 and 48‐h incubations. The results showed an increased radius of the inhibition zone for all six promoter‐engineered strains compared with X23‐WT (Fig. 5A). After 48 h of incubation, the radii of the inhibitory zones of X23(Pede::Pmwp), X23(Pede::Pgrac), X23(Pede::Pshuttle‐09), X23(Pede::Pspc), X23(Pede::PxylA) and X23(Pede::P43) were increased by 1.3 ± 0.2, 1.2 ± 0.2, 1.1 ± 0.2, 1.0 ± 0.1, 1.0 ± 0.2 and 0.9 ± 0.1‐fold, respectively, compared with the X23‐WT strain (Fig. 5B and C). Of note, there was no significant difference in the radius of inhibition zone between the promoter‐engineered X23(Pede::Pmwp) and X23(Pede::Pgrac) strains. Taken together, these results showed that promoter substitutions improved the antibacterial activity of B. brevis X23 against B. subtilis 168, and promoters Pmwp and Pgrac achieved the highest antimicrobial activities among the six promoters. The results also suggested that the promoter‐engineered strains produced antimicrobial substances earlier than X23‐WT.

Promoter substitutions significantly increased the expression of ede BGC To evaluate the effects of promoter substitutions on the expression of ede BGC, we assessed the transcriptional level of edeP gene based on quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR). Compared with X23‐WT, significantly increased expression of ede BGC was detected in the six promoter‐engineered strains with ede promoter substitutions after 12, 24 and 36 h of culture (Fig. 6). Fig. 6Relative expression of edeP on the ede BGC from various promoter‐engineered strains and X23‐WT at 12, 24, and 36 h as measured by qRT‐PCR. The cells of different strains were cultured in NB and incubated at 30°C for 12, 24, and 36 h. Total RNA was isolated for qRT‐PCR assays. X23‐WT was used as the control. The 16S rRNA was used for data normalization. Experiments were performed in triplicate.

The 16S rRNA was used for data normalization. Experiments were performed in triplicate. In the early growth stage (12 h), the level of ede BGC transcription in X23‐WT was extremely low because the expression of secondary metabolites such as edeines was repressed during the primary metabolic period by the global regulatory systems. In contrast, ede BGC expression in the promoter‐engineered strains was not limited by these regulatory systems, resulting in 2.9 ± 0.4 to 20.5 ± 1.2‐fold higher expression of the ede BGC in the early stage compared with X23‐WT. The highest (15.4 ± 1.9‐fold compared with X23‐WT) level of ede BGC expression after 12 h of culture was detected in X23(Pede::Pmwp). In the middle stage (24 h), expression of the ede BGC in X23‐WT was increased by 3.6 ± 0.8‐fold compared with that at 12 h. The highest (14.6 ± 1.0‐fold compared with X23‐WT) expression of ede BGC was detected in X23(Pede::Pgrac) after 24 h of culture. In the late period (36 h), expression of the ede BGC in X23‐WT rapidly decreased to 0.4 ± 0.1 (compared with that at 12 h), while in the six promoter‐engineered strains, it was still 3.1 ± 0.2 to 20.5 ± 1.2‐fold higher than that in X23‐WT. The highest (20.5 ± 1.2‐fold compared with X23‐WT) expression of ede BGC was detected in X23(Pede::Pgrac). Taken together, these results showed that expression of the ede BGC was significantly increased by the promoter substitutions, and promoters Pmwp and Pgrac provided the highest expression of the ede BGC. Quantitative analysis of edeine production in promoter‐engineered strains by HPLC‐MS analysis While the promoter substitutions were associated with improved antibacterial activity of B. brevis X23, it was not clear whether the improved antibacterial activity was due to increased production of edeines. We compared the production of edeines between the X23‐WT and promoter‐engineered strains based on HPLC–MS analysis (Fig. 7A and B).

Different letters indicate statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). We purified edeines A and B from the culture broth of B. brevis X23 because the standard compounds are not commercially available. HPLC and high‐resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) were conducted to determine the purity of edeines A and B (Figs S3 and S4). The structure of edeine A was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Figs S5 and S6). We further determined the absolute yield of edeines A and B using standard curve‐based quantitative analysis (Fig. S7). As shown in Fig. 7C, the amounts of edeines A and B were significantly higher in the fermentation broth of promoter‐engineered strains compared with X23‐WT after 48 h of culture, which was consistent with the antimicrobial activity assays. Compared with X23‐WT, the yields of edeines A and B produced by X23(Pede::Pmwp), X23(Pede::Pgrac), X23(Pede::Pshuttle‐09), X23(Pede::Pspc), X23(Pede::PxylA) and X23(Pede::P43) were increased by 8.7 ± 0.6, 8.0 ± 0.3, 4.4 ± 0.5, 7.2 ± 0.6, 7.9 ± 0.4 and 3.6 ± 0.1‐fold respectively (Fig. 7C and Table S4). The highest yield of edeine A (83.4 mg l−1) was detected in X23(Pede::Pmwp) compared with the X23‐WT strain (9.4 mg l−1), which was consistent with the antimicrobial test and gene expression of the ede BGC (Table S4). In contrast, an increased yield of edeine B was only detected in X23(Pede::PxylA) (0.3 mg l−1) compared with the X23‐WT strain (0.2 mg l−1). The total yield of edeines (edeine A and B) reached 83.59 mg l−1 in X23(Pede::Pmwp) (Table S4). Given that the yield of edeine B was much lower than that of edeine A and that edeine B contains an unusual guanyl‐spermidine reside rather than spermidine, we speculated that the availability of the precursor guanyl‐spermidine might limit edeine B production.
