RESULTS Cloning of tamI from and development of a genetic system for S. sp. 17944 Five TAM producers are known, including three Streptomyces species of terrestrial origin, Streptomyces tirandis,8
Streptomyces flaveolus,9 and S. sp. 17944,6 and two of marine origin, Streptomyces sp. 307-910 and Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666.11 The TAM biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned from S. sp. 307-9 (named as the tam cluster)12 and S. sp. SCSIO 1666 (named as the trd cluster).13 The deduced TAM biosynthetic machinery features the TAM hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) responsible for the TAM backbone and the TamI P-450 oxygenase responsible for most of the post hybrid PKS-NRPS oxidative tailoring modification steps (Figure 1).12–16 We cloned the tamI gene from S. sp. 17944 by PCR with primers designed according to the tam cluster of S. sp. 307-9.10 While the tamI/trdI genes from the two marine Streptomyces species are identical, the tamI gene from S. sp. 17944 is highly homologous to its marine orthologs but with subtle variations (95% identity at DNA sequence/97% identity at amino acid sequence), consistent with its terrestrial origin (Figure S1). S. sp. 17944 sporulates optimally on ISP-4 agar plates and grows well in TSB as a liquid culture. Among the common antibiotics used for genetic manipulation of natural product biosynthesis in Streptomyces,17
S. sp. 17944 is sensitive to apramycin (25 μg/mL), chloramphenicol (25 μg/mL), gentamycin (50 μg/mL), kanamycin (100 μg/mL), neomycin (30 μg/mL), spectinomycin (50 μg/mL), and thiostrepton (12.5 μg/mL) (given in parenthesis are concentrations that completely inhibit growth) and resistant to erythromycin (10 μg/mL), nalidixic acid (25 μg/mL), and trimethoprim (25 μg/mL) (given in parenthesis are concentrations that have no apparent inhibitory effect on growth), respectively. Therefore, apramycin (25 μg/mL) and nalidixic acid (25 μg/mL) were used to select the exconjugants via E. coli ET12567 (pUZ8002) - S. sp. 17944 conjugation,17 using pSET15218 and pKC113918 as representative Streptomyces integrating and replicating plasmids, respectively. Conjugation between E. coli ET12567 (pUZ8002) - S. sp. 17944 occurred with high frequencies on MS agar plates freshly supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2,19 with exconjugant frequencies for pSET152 and pKC1139 at approximately 10−5 and 10−6, respectively. Medium optimization of S. sp. 17944 for TAM production S. sp. 17944 was grown in six media, with varying carbon and nitrogen sources as well as metal ions, under the optimized fermentation conditions. The crude extracts were subjected to HPLC analysis to determine the TAM metabolite profiles, which varied significantly (Figure 2). While the ISP-2 medium yielded a mixture of TAMs, with 2 as the major TAM metabolite, a similarly metabolite profile was observed for medium B. In contrast, medium 042 produced 1 and both media 038 and F afforded 2 essentially as the sole TAM metabolite, respectively. Finally, medium SLY significantly suppressed the production of 1 and 2, and accumulated instead 3 and 5 as the major metabolites, two TAMs only produced in trace quantities in the original ISP-2 medium, as well as at least three new TAMs as minor metabolites (Figure 2). The titers of 1 in the six media were determined on the basis of HPLC analysis calibrated with an authentic 1 standard (Table 1). Under the optimized fermentation conditions using medium 042, 1 can be produced essentially as the sole TAM metabolite with a titer at approximately 22 mg/L. Isolation and structural elucidation of the new TAM congeners from S. sp 17944 The varying TAM profiles upon fermenting S. sp. 17944 in the six media provided an excellent opportunity to isolate new TAM congeners that would not be produced in the original ISP-2 medium (Figure 2). A large-scale fermentation of S. sp. 17944 in medium SLY (6 L), followed by multiple steps of SiO2, Sephadex LH-20, and preparative C-18 chromatography, afforded three new TAM congeners, 6 (8.7 mg), 7 (6.9 mg), and 8 (2.8 mg). The molecular formula of 6 was deducted as C22H29NO8 based on the HRESIMS spectrum that gave [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 436.1989 and 458.1811 (calculated [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 436.1971 and 458.1790), respectively. Comparison of the 1H and 13C data (Table 2) of 6 with previously reported TAM congeners6 indicated a close structural similarity among these compounds, which is further confirmed by the consistent appearance of the geminal protons of the tetramic acid methylene carbon and the olefinic and methyl signals of the dienoyl acyl chain (Figure 3). Thus, COSY and HMBC correlations of 6 demonstrated a close identity to 3, which was isolated previously from S. sp. 17944.6 The disappearance of the H3-18 signal with the concomitant appearance of oxymethylene moiety (δC 59.1, C-18 and δH 4.43 and 4.31, H2-18) (Table 2), which is also supported by the 16 mass unit difference from 6 and 3, suggests that 6 is likely a C-10 hydroxylated congener of 3. This new moiety was further confirmed by the gHMBC correlations of H2-18 to C-11 (δC 61.3), C-12 (δC 60.2), and C-13 (δC 96.7) (Figure 3). Since the absolute stereochemistry of 2 was known,6,20
6, named as TAM H, was assigned the same stereochemistry as 2 on the basis of its biosynthetic origin (Figures 1). HRESIMS analysis of 7 yielded [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 582.2583 and 604.2405, respectively, predicting a molecular formula of C28H39NO12 (calculated [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 582.2550 and 604.2369). The 13C NMR data of 7 (Table 1) was very similar to those of 36 with the exception of extra six resonances, which indicated an additional hexose moiety. The structure of the aglycone moiety was further confirmed to be 3 by key COSY and HMBC correlations (Figure 3). The hexose moiety was established by a 1D-TOCSY experiment, verified to be a glucoside by gHSQC, gHMBC, gCOSY, and TOCSY correlations, and further confirmed to be an α-glucoside by comparison with previously reported NMR data and analysis of the coupling constant for the anomeric proton H-1″ (δc 5.51, d, J = 2.4 Hz) (Table 2).21,22 The glucosidic linkage was established at position C-10 by the gHMBC correlation of the anomeric proton H-1″ (δH 5.51) to C-10 (δC 71.3). This was further supported by the NOESY correlations between H-10 (δH 4.83) and H-1″ (δH 5.51), which also showed correlations to H-3″ (δH 4.47) and H-5″ (δH 4.34), confirming the α-D-glucoside configuration (Figure 3). On the basis of these data, 7 was assigned as TAM I, a TAM E-10-α-D-glucoside with its absolute stereochemistry inferred from biosynthesis (Figure 1). The molecular formula C30H37NO12 for 8 was established on the basis of HRESIMS analysis that afforded [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 596.2376 and 618.2198 (calculated [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions at m/z 596.2343 and 618.2162), respectively. Careful comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data of 8 (Table 2) with previously reported TAM congeners revealed a close identity to 1 with an additional hexose moiety. The latter was confirmed to be an α-glucoside by comparison with NMR data of the hexose moiety of 7 (Table 2), the coupling constant of the anomeric proton H-1″ (δc 5.47, d, J = 2.5 Hz), and the COSY and TOCSY correlations. Thus, the glucosidic linkage was established at position C-18 by the gHMBC correlation of the anomeric proton H-1″ (δH 5.47) to C-18 (δC 57.8). This was further supported by the NOESY correlations between H2-18 (δH 4.68, 4.13) and H-1″ (δH 5.47) (Figure 3). These data allowed the final assignment of 8 as TAM J, a TAM B-180-α-D-glucoside with its absolute stereochemistry similarly deduced on the base of biosynthesis (Figure 1). Evaluation of 6, 7, and 8 for BmAsnRS inhibitory activity The three new TAM congeners, 6, 7, and 8 were evaluated for their BmAsnRS inhibitory activity following the previous procedure6 with 1 as a positive control. None of the congeners showed any apparent inhibitory activity at 200 μM.
