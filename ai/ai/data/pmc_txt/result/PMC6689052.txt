Results Metabolomics led identification of the formicapyridines The aromatic, polycyclic nature of these molecules limited fragmentation and the effectiveness of molecular networking via the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking web platform9. Instead, as most fasamycin and formicamycin congeners are halogenated (Fig. 1), we established a bespoke dereplication method, making use of S. formicae KY5 mutants that we reported previously, including an entire BGC deletion strain (Δfor), and a strain in which the halogenase gene was deleted (ΔforV)5 (Fig. 2). Our earlier study5 showed that the Δfor mutant does not produce any fasamycins or formicamycins, and the ΔforV mutant produces only non-halogenated fasamycin congeners.Fig. 2Metabolomics pipeline. Dereplication, based on for biosynthetic mutants and exogenous bromide addition, led to the identification of the new congeners 4–9 with characteristic halogen-containing patterns (strain ΔforV lacks a halogenase gene; Δfor lacks the entire biosynthetic gene cluster) Fig. 2Metabolomics pipeline.

Using the Profiling Solutions software (Shimadzu Corporation), the WT dataset (Supplementary Data 1 and 2) was filtered to remove ions also present in the other samples. Only two other BGCs in the S. formicae KY5 genome10 contain putative halogenase encoding genes, so we hypothesised that any chlorine-containing ions present in the filtered dataset would likely derive from the formicamycin BGC. This process dramatically reduced the dataset complexity, leaving <200 unique ions from an original set of ∼3000. Manual curation showed that most of the remaining ions corresponded to halogenated molecules (based on isotope patterns), leaving twelve previously identified fasamycin and formicamycin congeners, two additional fasamycin/formicamycin congeners that remain uncharacterized due to trace levels, and the known isoflavone 6-chlorogenistein11 (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs. 11–14) along with a regioisomer. Analysis of C/H ratios and m/z data allowed us to identify a group of three additional metabolites (4–6) with mass spectra suggesting a close structural relationship to the fasamycins/formicamycins; these varied only in the number of methyl groups present. By searching for equivalent ions lacking chlorine atoms we identified three additional congeners (1–3). Compounds 1–6 were not initially observed in the UV chromatograms of the WT, and qualitative examination of the LCMS data suggested titres at least 100-fold lower than for the formicamycins. Furthermore, the m/z data implied the presence of a single nitrogen atom. We repeated the experiment but included a set of WT strain fermentations to which sodium bromide (2 mM) was added, as our previous study showed this leads to the biosynthesis of brominated formicamycin congeners5. This identified three conditional bromine-containing metabolites (7–9) with MS characteristics like those of 4–6 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1), supporting the hypothesis that these compounds represent biosynthetic congeners. Isolation and structure elucidation and biological activity HRMS data allowed us to predict molecular formulae for 1–9 that were used to search the online chemical database REAXYS. This suggested that they represented new structures. To isolate sufficient material for structure determination and antibacterial assays, the growth of S. formicae KY5 was scaled up (14 L; ~450 MS agar plates). After 9 days incubation at 30 °C the combined agar was chopped up, extracted with ethyl acetate, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The resulting extract was subjected to repeated rounds of reversed-phase HPLC followed by Sephadex LH-20 size exclusion chromatography leading to small quantities of purified 1–6. We first determined the structure of 2 which was isolated in the largest amount (~2 mg). HRMS and 13C NMR data indicated a molecular formula of C28H25NO6 (calculated m/z 472.1755 ([M + H]+); observed m/z 472.1753 ([M + H]+); Δ = −0.4 ppm) indicating 17 degrees of unsaturation. The UV spectrum showed absorption maxima at 229, 249, 272 and 392 nm indicating a complex conjugated system different to that of the fasamycins/formicamycins5. Inspection of the 13C NMR spectrum showed 21 sp2 carbons (δC 99.90–167.54 ppm), one carbonyl carbon (δC 191.81 ppm), four methyl carbons (δC 20.41, 23.59, 34.56 and 37.75 ppm), one methoxy carbon (δC 55.80 ppm) and one sp3 quaternary carbon (δC 40.49 ppm). The 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of five methyl singlets (δH 1.75, 1.76, 1.93, 3.67 and 3.81 ppm), two aromatic proton singlets (δH 7.62 and 7.65 ppm), plus four aromatic proton doublets (δH 6.24 (d, 2.25 Hz), 6.70 (d, 2.25 Hz), 6.34 (d, 2.27 Hz) and 6.42 (d, 2.27 Hz)). Limited 1H–1H COSY correlations meant we were reliant upon HMBC-based atomic connections, and through-space NOESY correlations, which led to two potential substructures consisting of 26 carbon atoms, leaving one carbonyl, one phenol and one quaternary carbon unassigned (Fig. 3). This left some uncertainty, but given the relationship with the fasamycins, we predicted the structure to be that shown for 2. We thus plotted the 13C chemical shifts for 2 against those for fasamycin C (10), the closest structural congener. The data were in excellent agreement with the main differences at C7, C22 and C23, consistent with the adjacent nitrogen atom (Supplementary Fig. 2). With the structure of 2 in hand we readily assigned the structures of 1 and 3–6. NOESY correlations played a key role allowing us to link the methoxy group at C3 with H2 and H4 (e.g. 2, 3, 5 and 6), and the methoxy at C5 with H4 (e.g. 3 and 6). We also used NOESY and HSQC correlations to distinguish C14 and C16 once one was chlorinated: given the NOESY correlations to the gem-dimethyl groups of C26 and C27 with H16, and the disappearance of a HSQC linkage for C14, we concluded that C14 was chlorinated (e.g. 4–6). Compounds 1–6 exhibit optical activity with small [α]20D values between +8° and +13° indicating probable atropoisomerism about the axis of the C6–C7 bond. We attempted to assign the absolute configuration by combining computational approaches with electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra as done for the fasamycins5. However, despite scaling up production to isolate additional 2, meaningful ECD spectra could not be obtained. Full characterization data for 1–6 are presented in Supplementary Note 1. Due to the very low levels of 7–9, we have assigned preliminary structures based on 4–6, with a bromine atom replacing chlorine at C14.Fig. 3Structure determination.

Similarly, no inhibition was seen at tenfold this concentration (50 µg mL−1), with only small zones of inhibition at 100-fold (500 µg mL−1). To confirm this was not a result of reduced diffusion from the disc, assays were set up to test growth of B. subtillis 168 in liquid cultures containing compounds 1–6, but again they showed no activity. Biosynthetic origins Interrogation of LC-HRMS data from extracts of the Δfor and ΔforV mutants verified that the fasamycin/formicamycin BGC is required for formicapyridine production. The Δfor mutant does not produce 1–6 (Supplementary Fig. 3b vs. 3a), but production of all six compounds was restored upon ectopic expression of the P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) pESAC13–215-G containing the entire formicamycin BGC (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Similarly, the ∆forV mutant does not produce 4–6 (Supplementary Fig. 3d), but their production is re-established upon ectopic expression of forV under the control of the native promoter using an integrative plasmid (Supplementary Fig. 3e) (the construction of all strains, the requirement of the for BGC for production of the fasamycins and formicamycins, and the requirement of ForV for their halogenation were described previously5). The very low level of formicapyridines made by the WT strain suggests they are shunt metabolites arising from aberrant derailment of fasamycin/formicamycin biosynthesis. On this basis, we suggest a biosynthetic pathway as described in Fig. 4. Assembly of the poly-β-ketone tridecaketide intermediate should proceed as previously proposed on route to the fasamycins5. This would be followed by a series of cyclization and aromatisation steps, presumably in a sequential manner, with the final cyclization event probably involving formation of the B-ring. However, premature hydrolysis of the acylcarrier protein from putative intermediate 27, prior to the action of a final cyclase, would liberate the enzyme-free, β-ketoacid species 28 that would be highly facile to spontaneous decarboxylation yielding the methylketone 29. The action of an endogenous aminotransferase could then generate either of the species 30 or 31, which could undergo cyclization, dehydration and oxidation to yield 1. Consistent with a shunt pathway, no aminotransferase encoding gene could be identified in the for BGC, and although numerous putative aminotransferase encoding genes were identified in the genome, none could be linked to a role in formicapyridine biosynthesis. Alternatively, direct addition of ammonia to the C23 ketone would generate an imine, tautomerize to the enamine, and the resulting amino group could then attack the C7 ketone. Subsequent dehydration would lead directly to the formicapyridine system with no requirement of an oxidation reaction.Fig. 4Proposed biosynthesis of the formicapyridine backbone. Derailment of fasamycin biosynthesis due to premature hydrolysis of the PKS acylcarrier protein leads to the β-ketoacid intermediate 28 which is facile to decarboxylation yielding methylketone 29.

Transamination of 29 leads of amine intermediates which can undergo spontaneous cyclization and aromatization to yield formicapyridines This pathway requires that C25 of the formicapyridines originates from C2 of an acetate unit, with C1 lost via decarboxylation. To support our hypothesis, and the backbone structural assignments, S. formicae KY5 was cultivated on MS agar plates for two days and then overlaid with a solution of [1,2-13C2] sodium acetate (1 mL of 60 mM solution; final concentration 2 mM). This was repeated on the four following days, and after a total of 9 days incubation the agar was extracted with ethyl acetate and the most abundant congener was isolated (2, ~1 mg), and the 13C NMR spectrum was acquired. Due to the small amount of material, and overlapping signals, only eight of the intact acetate units could be unambiguously identified based on their coupling contests. In addition, a singlet was observed for C25 which showed weak enrichment (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. 4). This is consistent with our biosynthetic hypothesis, which requires that the carbon atom at C25 derives from C2 of a fragmented acetate unit. The data were in accordance with the proposed structure for 2.Fig. 5The methyl group carbon C25 arises from C2 of acetate. Comparison of 13C NMR spectra for 2 isolated after growth in the presence of [1,2-13C2] sodium acetate. Integration of the 13C NMR spectra confirmed weak enrichment of the 13C isotope and the absence of coupling to any adjacent carbon atom. In contrast, the methyl group atom C24 shows enrichment and coupling to C1.

Suppose, in some environmental scenario, the presence of formicapyridines leads to a selection advantage. Is there then a single mutation in the BGC that could rapidly lead to enhanced levels of their production, and, in addition, could such changes lead to the reduction or even abolition of fasamycin/formicamycin biosynthesis? The proposed biosynthetic pathway likely requires the action of multiple polyketide cyclase/aromatase enzymes and this suggests that one cyclase could be dedicated to formation of ring-B in the final step of backbone biosynthesis (Fig. 4). On this basis we hypothesised that mutation of a gene encoding a putative ring-B cyclase might lead to the phenotype imagined in our thought experiment by eliminating the biosynthesis of fasamycins/formicamycins and shunting carbon flux into the proposed formicapyridine pathway. BLAST and conserved domain analysis, in conjunction with structural modelling using the Phyre2 web portal for protein modelling and analysis13, allowed us to identify five genes in the for BGC, which might encode potential cyclase/aromatase enzymes (Table 1).Table 1Characteristics of the putative PKS cyclase genes in the for BGCNameSequence identityTop BLASTp hitAnnotation% Coverage% IdentityForDWP_098245758.1WP_003962252.1Polyketide cyclase (TcmN), Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 270649573ForLWP_055544278.1WP_076971949.1TcmI family type II polyketide cyclase, Streptomyces sparsogenes9752ForRWP_098245762.1AUI41024.1Polyketide WhiE II Streptomyces sp., cupin domain9675ForSWP_098245763SDF47214.1Antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase, Lechevalieria fradiae9648ForUWP_098245765.1PZS28546.1Antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase, Pseudonocardiales bacteria8446 Characteristics of the putative PKS cyclase genes in the for BGC Name Sequence identity Top BLASTp hit Annotation % Coverage % Identity.

The gene product ForD shows significant sequence similarity to aromatase/cyclases such as the N-terminal domain (pfam 03364) of the archetypical tetracenomycin polyketide cyclase TcmN, which belongs to the Bet v1-like superfamily (cl10022)14. In vivo analysis15–17 and in vitro reconstruction18 showed that TcmN catalyses formation of the first two rings of tetracenomycin via sequential C9–C14 and C7–C16 cyclization/aromatization reactions. Thus, we predict ForD, which will play a key role in formation of the rings E and D during fasamycin biosynthesis. The ForL gene product belongs to the TcmI family of polyketide cyclases (cl24023; pfam 04673). The function of TcmI has been verified by in vivo mutational analysis19 and biochemical characterisation20,21. It catalyses cyclization of the final ring during formation of tetracenomycin F1 from tetracenomycin F2, and this reaction is remarkably like that proposed in our hypothesis for the formation of ring-B as the final step of fasamycin backbone assembly (Fig. 4). ForR is a homologue of the zinc containing polyketide cyclase RemF from the resistomycin BGC22,23. RemF is a single domain protein (pfam 07883) comprising the conserved barrel domain of the cupin superfamily (cl21464)24. Finally, the gene products ForS and ForU are both single domain proteins (pfam 03992) belonging to the ABM superfamily (cl10022). A notable member of this family is ActVA-orf6, which functions as a monooxygenase during biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin; the structure of this enzyme has been solved and it is topologically related to the PKS cyclase TcmI and homologues25. Notably, ABM family domains are found in several PKS cyclases including the C-terminal domain of BenH from the benastatin BGC26,27, which also comprises an N-terminal TcmN like cyclase domain (pfam 03364); and WhiE Protein 1 and other members of the SchA/CurD-like family of PKS enzymes commonly associated with BGCs for the biosynthesis of spore pigments in Streptomyces spp28–30. SchA/CurD- and WhiE Protein 1-like enzymes are comprised of an N-terminal ABM domain and a C-terminal PKS cyclase domain (pfam 00486; superfamily cl24023). To interrogate their roles, we used Cas9-mediated genome editing31 to make in-frame deletions in each of these five putative cyclase genes (forD, forL, forR, forS and forU). Three independent mutants generated from each gene deletion experiment, along with the WT strain, were grown on MS agar and cultured at 30 °C for 9 days. To assess differences in secondary metabolite production the ethyl acetate extracts from each culture were subjected to HPLC(UV) and LCMS analysis (Supplementary Data 3 and 4). The metabolic profiles showed that the ΔforD, ΔforL, ΔforR and ΔforU mutants lost the ability to produce formicapyridines, fasamycins and formicamycins (Supplementary Figs. 5–9), and no new shunt metabolites could be identified despite rigorous interrogation of the LCMS and LC(UV) data. These deletions could be rescued by complementation with the deleted gene under control of either the native promoter (ΔforD/forD and ΔforL/forL) or the constitutive ermE* promoter (ΔforR/forR), although the titres did not reach that of the WT strain in all cases. For the ΔforU mutant complementation with forU restored production of the non-halogenated congener 10 only, indicating a polar effect on the downstream halogenase forV gene. Subsequent complementation with a forUV cassette under the ermE* promoter in which the two genes were transcriptionally fused led to the production of halogenated fasamycin and formicamycin congeners. In contrast, production of formicapyridines was increased ∼25-fold in the ΔforS mutant when compared with the WT (Fig. 6). These effects were complemented by ectopic expression of forS under the control of the ermE* promoter. Moreover, the ΔforS mutant was significantly compromised in its ability to produce formicamycins, with their titre being reduced to approximately one third that of the WT strain. This is consistent with our hypothesis for formicapyridine biosynthesis and suggests that ForS plays a role during B-ring closure, and that this constitutes the final step of fasamycin backbone biosynthesis. It also demonstrates that the final cyclization step can still occur without ForS. While carrying out analysis of the ΔforS mutant we identified a minor congener, which was not identified in any WT strain fermentations. Scale up growth (4 L) and solvent extraction, followed by isolation (3.4 mg) and structural elucidation identified this compound (13) as the C24-carboxyl analogue of fasamycin C (which we have named fasamycin F). This is the first congener identified with the C24-carboxyl group intact.Fig. 6Mutational analysis of forS. Reconstituted HPLC chromatograms (UV; 390 nm) showing: a formicapyridine standards 1–6; b
