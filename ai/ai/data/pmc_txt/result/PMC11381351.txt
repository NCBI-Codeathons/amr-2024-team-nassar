Results B. subtilis YfmR is a member of the Uup/EttA ABCF clade YfmR is classified with ABCF Hidden Markov models as a member of the Uup subfamily (29). The Uup subfamily is not monophyletic, but rather is paraphyletic to the EttA subfamily, which arose from an Uup-like progenitor (Figure 2, (29)). Uup subfamily members typically carry a C-terminal domain (CTD), which is absent in EttA, suggesting this domain was lost after the uup gene duplication that gave rise to EttA. The monophyly of the Uup + EttA clade is strongly supported (99.7% SH-aLRT and 100% bootstrap support). Figure 2.

Simultaneous disruption of yfmR and efp results in a synthetic growth defect We took a genetic approach to probe the functional interactions between housekeeping ABCFs and EF-P in the B. subtilis 168 strain. While genomic disruptions of individual ABCF genes in the wild-type background do not affect B. subtilis growth on LB medium at the optimal temperature (37°C), deletion of yfmR—but not any of the other three housekeeping ABCFs—results in severe growth defect in the Δefp background (Figure 3A). Sucrose gradient centrifugation experiments reveal the low abundance of polysomes as well as accumulation of 40S ribosome assembly intermediates in the Δefp ΔyfmR double deletion strain, consistent with perturbed protein synthesis (Supplementary Figure S1). Finally, no genetic interaction was observed for efp and poorly understood translational GTPases bipA and lepA (Figure 3A), suggesting, expectedly, that these factors are not operating together with EF-P.

(D) Polyproline stalling reporter (GFP-P10-(GS)2-P10-SUMO, pCHT55) detects ribosomal stalling in Δefp but not ΔyfmR B. subtilis. The reporter was expressed in wild-type, ΔyfmR (strain BCHT214), Δefp (strain BCHT214), ΔrqcH (strain BCHT58) or ΔrqcP (strain BCHT56) B. subtilis and detected with anti-GFP antibodies. The full-length product is indicated with a green arrowhead and the stalled product is indicated with a red dotted line. Fraction of the stalled (short) product was quantified from three independent biological replicates and shown as mean ± standard deviation. We have complemented the double deletion Δefp ΔyfmR strain with either wild-type or the ATPase-deficient EQ2 variant of YfmR expressed under the control of IPTG-inducible Phy-spank promoter (55). Even in the absence of IPTG, leaky expression of the wild-type protein partially suppressed the growth defect; addition of 1 mM IPTG resulted in full suppression (Figure 3B). Low-level expression of the ATPase-deficient YfmR-EQ2 driven by the native Shine-Dalgarno motif fails to complement, consistent with the ATPase activity being essential (Figure 3B). Next, we tested whether ectopic overexpression of housekeeping ABCFs could suppress the growth defect of the Δefp ΔyfmR strain. While Phy-spank-driven overexpression of YfmM and YkpA/YbiT has no effect, overexpression of YdiF further exacerbates the growth defect of Δefp ΔyfmR B. subtilis (Figure 3C). A genetic interaction between efp and ydiF has previously been shown earlier by Hummels and Kearn who have demonstrated that the swarming defect of the Δefp B. subtilis strain can be suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in ydiF (58). Notably, in the absence of IPTG, low-level leaky expression of YfmM and YkpA partially suppresses the growth defect of the Δefp ΔyfmR strain, which could suggest partial functional redundance between YfmR and these two ABCF ATPases (see the section Redundancy and specialisation of B. subtilis ABCFs, below). YfmR is not essential for efficient translation of polyproline stretches in efp+ B. subtilis There can be several alternative explanations for the strong genetic interaction between efp and yfmR. One possibility is that EF-P and YfmR are both required for translation of proline-rich motifs, providing partially redundant solutions to this stalling problem. To test this hypothesis we used a homopolymeric polyproline stalling reporter based on that developed by Chadani and colleagues (54). The reporter gene encodes an N-terminal GFP and C-terminal SUMO tag linked by a 24-amino-acid-long linker with a sequence of P10-(GS)2-P10; two 10-amino-acid-long stalling motifs connected by a flexible ‘joint’ that is not stalling-prone. The gene encoding the reporter was cloned on a self-replicated plasmid pHT01-based plasmid (56) and the expression was driven by IPTG-inducible Phy-spank promoter. While the full-length version of the reporter construct was efficiently produced in the wild-type B. subtilis, only a fraction of the full-length product is synthesised in the Δefp strain, with the majority of the ribosomes stalling and generating a short version of the reporter (Figure 3D). The ΔyfmR strain behaved like the wild-type, with no short versions of the reporter being produced. Therefore, we concluded that YfmR is unlikely to be involved in translation of strongly stalling polyproline stretches and that EF-P and YfmR synergise in other, yet-undefined stalling motifs. EF-P variants lacking the K32 residue or its 5-aminopentanol modification can still efficiently suppress of the growth defect of Δefp ΔyfmR B. subtilis With the notable exception of Actinobacterial EF-P (11), the posttranslational modification of a conserved lysine residue is crucial for the factor's functionality in resolving polyproline stalling, both in living cells and a reconstituted biochemical system (6,8,14,18). However, it is conceivable that the modification is not essential for the hypothetical activity on which EF-P and YfmR work together. To probe this hypothesis, we tested whether EF-P lacking the modification of conserved K32 residue—or the K32 residue altogether—can suppress the synthetic growth defect of Δefp ΔyfmR B. subtilis. Surprisingly, a ΔyfmR B. subtilis strain expressing the K32A EF-P variant does not phenocopy the severe growth defect of the Δefp ΔyfmR double knockout (Figure 4A). Next, we tested the genetic interaction between yfmR and the genes involved in the 5-aminopentanol modification of the K32 residue: yaaO, yfkA, ynbB, gsaB and yfmI (18). Previous mass spectrometry studies have established that while in ΔyaaO and ΔyfkA B. subtilis strains EF-P retains low levels of 5-aminopentanol modification, in ΔynbB and ΔgsaB strains the K32 residue is acetylated and in ΔymfI it carries 5-aminopentanone instead of 5-aminopentanol (18,59). None of the tested genes strongly genetically interact with the yfmR disruption: none of the double-knockout strains display a severe growth defect either; a minor growth defect is detectable in ΔyaaO ΔyfmR (Figure 4B). Figure 4.5-amino-pentanolylated residue K32 of EF-P is not essential for supporting a near-wild-type fitness of the ΔyfmRB. subtilis. (A) Effect of the efpK32Amutation on the negative genetic interaction between yfmR and efp.

(B) Effects of disruption of the genes involved in the 5-aminopentanol modification of the K32 residue of EF-P on the growth of ΔyfmR B. subtilis. Wild-type, ΔyfmR (strain BCHT170), ΔyfmRΔefp (strain BCHT191), ΔyfmRΔymfI (strain BCHT396), ΔyfmRΔynbB (strain BCHT395), ΔyfmRΔyfkA (strain BCHT394), ΔyfmRΔyaaO (strain BCHT393) and ΔyfmRΔgsaB (strain BCHT392) B. subtilis were grown on solid LB medium at 37°C. (C) Effects of the K32A substitution and genetic disruption of the K32 5-aminopentanol modification on the ribosomal stalling on polyproline. GFP-P10-(GS)2-P10-SUMO reporter (pCHT55) was expressed in wild-type, Δefp (strain BCHT214), efpK32A (strain BCHT765), ΔynbB (strain BCHT336), ΔyfkA (strain BCHT334), ΔymfI (strain BCHT335), ΔgsaB (strain BCHT332) or ΔyaaO (strain BCHT333) B. subtilis and detected with anti-GFP antibodies. The full-length product is indicated with a green arrowhead and the stalled product is indicated with a red dotted line.

(C) Effects of the K32A substitution and genetic disruption of the K32 5-aminopentanol modification on the ribosomal stalling on polyproline. GFP-P10-(GS)2-P10-SUMO reporter (pCHT55) was expressed in wild-type, Δefp (strain BCHT214), efpK32A (strain BCHT765), ΔynbB (strain BCHT336), ΔyfkA (strain BCHT334), ΔymfI (strain BCHT335), ΔgsaB (strain BCHT332) or ΔyaaO (strain BCHT333) B. subtilis and detected with anti-GFP antibodies. The full-length product is indicated with a green arrowhead and the stalled product is indicated with a red dotted line. Fraction of the stalled (short) product was quantified from three independent biological replicates and shown as mean ± standard deviation. We next used our polyproline stalling reporter [GFP-P10-(GS)2-P10-SUMO] to assess the effects of the K32A substitution—as well as disruption of the 5-aminopentanol modification pathway—on EF-P’s functionality in promoting translation elongation on polyproline stretches. The K32A substitution phenocopied the Δefp strain (Figure 4C). This result is in good agreement with analogous in vivo assays by Rajkovic and colleagues who tested an array of different PPX stalling peptides such as PPW, PPG, PPP, PPR (15). Mutations in the enzymes implicated in the 5-aminopentanol modification of the K32 residue strongly—although not as completely as the K32A substitution—compromised EF-P’s activity (Figure 4C). The weakest effect was observed in the case of disruption of YfmI, an enzyme which catalyses the last step in EF-P modification, the reduction EF-P-5-aminopentanone to EF-P-5-aminopentanol (59). Overexpression of YfmR/Uup alleviates the ribosomal stalling on Asp-Pro motifs in Δefp B. subtilis We next tested whether overexpression of YfmR can improve the ability of the B. subtilis translational apparatus to synthesise challenging motifs. Inspired by the work by Chadani and colleagues (54), we used a series of diverse GFP-linker-SUMO reporters with different linker sequences. The presence of a C-terminal SUMO domain allowed efficient separation of the stalled product that lacks this domain from the full length version. Specifically, we tested homopolymeric P10-(GS)2-P10 and D10-(GS)2-D10 as well as ‘mixed’ (DP)5-(GS)2-(DP)2. The two proline-rich linkers are expected to specifically cause ribosomal stalling in Δefp B. subtilis while the highly negatively charged poly-Asp motif is in general challenging for translation (54). Finally, the A10-(GS)2-A10 motif was used as a negative control as no stalling is expected in wild-type and Δefp B. subtilis. The FLAG-tagged versions of either wild-type or functionally compromised proteins (ATPase-deficient EQ2 variants) were expressed under the control of a xylose-inducible Pxy promotor. In this case YfmR was expressed under the control of strong Shine-Dalgarno motif, and this strong expression of YfmR-EQ2 is associated with a growth defect, most likely due to non-productive ribosomal association inhibiting translation. We have observed analogous effects in the case of ATPase-deficient housekeeping ABCFs in E. coli (29). Overexpression of either wild-type or K32A-substituted EF-P was used as two additional controls, and the reporter assays were performed either in wild-type or a Δefp genetic background. Anti-FLAG immunoblotting experiments revealed that wild-type and K32A-substituted EF-P variants are expressed at similar levels, while YfmR-EQ2 is expressed at a lower level than the wild-type factor, consistent with the inhibitory function of the ATPase-deficient ABCF factor on protein synthesis (Supplementary Figure S1). As expected, no truncated versions of the control GFP-A10-(GS)2-A10-SUMO reporter are detectable by anti-GFP antibodies regardless of the strain background and the protein expressed (Figure 5A). Near 100%-efficient stalling on P10-(GS)2-P10 in Δefp B. subtilis is fully resolved upon overexpression of wild-type EF-P; overexpression of the K32A-substituted variant failed to resolve the stall (Figure 5B). While overexpression of wild-type YfmR did not restore the production of the full-length reporter, it resulted in formation of a longer stalled product (marked with a red asterisk on Figure 5B), indicative of a possible modest stimulatory effect. Expression of YfmR-EQ2 decreased both the full-length and stalled reporter signal, most likely due to translation inhibition caused by the factor being locked in the ribosomal E-site. Experiments with a weaker EF-P-sensitive staller, (DP)5-(GS)2-(DP)2, indicated the ability of YfmR to resolve ribosomal stalls on proline-rich motifs: expression of either EF-P or YfmR abrogated the stalled signal, and the effect was specific for wild-type factors (Figure 5C, Supplementary Figure S2). Finally, we tested whether overexpression of either EF-P or YfmR could overcome ribosomal stalling on acidic poly-Asp motifs (Figure 5D). In agreement with EF-P not being able to resolve the poly-Asp stalling, the strength of stalled signal was similar in wild-type and Δefp B. subtilis. Overexpression of neither of the factors could resolve ribosomal stalling on the D10-(GS)2-D10 motif. Figure 5.Overexpression of YfmR/Uup ABCF alleviates the ribosomal stalling on Asp-Pro motifs. Effects of EF-P and YfmR overexpression on ribosomal stalling on polyproline, polyaspartic acid as well as mixed Asp-Pro stalling motifs. GFP-A10-(GS)2-A10-SUMO (pCHT54) (A), GFP-P10-(GS)2-P10-SUMO (pCHT55) (B), GFP-(DP)5-(GS)2-(DP)5-SUMO (pCHT12) (C) and GFP-D10-(GS)2-D10-SUMO (pCHT15) (D) reporters were expressed in wild-type, Δefp (strain BCHT214) as well as in Δefp B. subtilis expressing either efpFLAG(strain BCHT1367), efpK32AFLAG(strain BCHT1368), yfmRFLAG (strain BCHT1369) or yfmREQ2FLAG (strain BCHT1370) under the control of xylose promoter.

The three individual experimental replicates of the panel (C) are shown on the Supplementary Figure S2. B. subtilis YkpA/YbiT promotes translation of positively and negatively charged motifs Prompted by our results with YfmR, we decided to examine the possible involvement of all of the four B. subtilis ABCFs—YfmR, YdiF, YfmM and YkpA/YbiT—in translating diverse challenging sequences. As stretches of both highly positively and negatively charged amino acids can be challenging for the ribosome (54,60–63), we have also included polybasic [K10-(GS)2-K10 and R10-(GS)2-R10] motifs as well as an additional polyacidic [D10-(GS)2-D10] linker, respectively. We tested all of the reporters listed above in wild-type and Δefp B. subtilis as well as the four Δabcf B. subtilis strains: ΔyfmR, ΔydiF, ΔykpA or ΔyfmM. As expected, all of the strains produce exclusively the full-length version of the GFP-A10-(GS)2-A10-SUMO reporter (Figure 6A). None of the ABCFs are crucial for translation of polyproline stretches in efp+B. subtilis: while the short, stalled version of the GFP-P10-(GS)2-P10-SUMO reporter is dominant in Δefp B. subtilis, only the full-length signal is detectable in all of the Δabcf strains (Figure 6B). An analogous result was obtained with GFP-(DP)5-(GS)2-(DP)2-SUMO, although the strength of stalling in the Δefp background is considerably weaker: the stalled form constitutes about 20% of the total signal (Figure 6C). Experiments with polybasic stallers yielded non-trivial results. In the case of K10-(GS)2-K10 linker we detected specific (but relatively weak) stalling in the ΔykpA (ΔybiT) strain (Figure 6D). While the R10-(GS)2-R10 motif was challenging for all of the tested strains, the strongest stalling signal was, again, observed in the case of ΔykpA B. subtilis. Furthermore, weak ΔykpA-specific stalling was observed in the case of E10-(GS)2-E10 polyacidic linker (Figure 6F). The polyacidic D10-(GS)2-D10 reporter was equally challenging for all of the tested strains (Figure 6G). Collectively, our results suggest that YbiT could be assisting the ribosome in negotiating charged amino acid patches. Figure 6.YkpA/YbiT loss results in mild ribosomal stalling on positively charged polylysine and negatively charged polyglutamic acid motifs.

Fraction of the stalled (short) product was quantified from three independent biological replicates and shown as mean ± standard deviation. Redundancy and specialization of B. subtilis ABCFs We wondered whether the reason for the modest stalling effects we observed upon disrupting individual abcf genes could be the partial functional redundance between the factors analogous to that demonstrated for paralagous EF-P and EfpL (9). To test this hypothesis, we created a set of efp+ B. subtilis strains in which we disrupted the ABCF genes in pairwise combinations, in combinations of three and, finally, a Δ4abcf strain in which all the four genes are disrupted—in which to test our stalling reporters. The strains displayed no growth defects or increased sensitivity to low concentrations of translation targeting antibiotics c (Supplementary Figure S3) As expected, we did not detect any stalling on the A10-(GS)2-A10 motif in any of the strains (Figure 7A, Supplementary Figure S4A). Similarly, no stalling was observed on the P10-(GS)2-P10 motif either, which is expected for efp+ B. subtilis (Figure 7B, Supplementary Figure S4B). While stalling is not detected on the (DP)5-(GS)2-(DP)2 motif in either of the tested double-KO strains (Figure 7C), modest stalling is detectable in the ΔyfmR ΔykpA ΔyfmM background (Figure 7D). The effect is not exacerbated by the additional loss of YdiF in the Δ4abcf strain (Figure 7D), suggesting that YdiF does not contribute to resolution of the stalls. Taken together with the observation that leaky overexpression of YfmM and YkpA partially suppresses the growth defect of the Δefp ΔyfmR strain (Figure 3C), this result further strengthens the idea of a functional overlap between YfmR, YkpA and YfmM. Additional disruptions of ABCF genes in the ΔykpA B. subtilis strain does not exacerbate the stalling on the polybasic K10-(GS)2-K10 and R10-(GS)2-R10 (Figure 7E, F, Supplementary Figure S4C, D) as well as polybasic in E10-(GS)2-E10 and D10-(GS)2-D10 (Figure 7G, H, Supplementary Figure S4E, F). This suggests that YkpA is specifically competent in resolving ribosomal stalls on charged motifs.

Simultaneous disruption of bipA and efp results in a cold sensitivity in B. subtilis In our previous study of E. coli Uup, we have observed a modest genetic interaction between uup and bipA, with the simultaneous deletion of the two genes exacerbating cold sensitivity phenotype of the ΔbipA strain (33). We wondered is the same holds for B. subtilis YfmR/Uup. To test this, we have systematically disrupted the abcf genes in wild-type, ΔbipA and ΔlepA strains; the latter served as a specificity control. Since YfmR/Uup appears to have functional similarities to EF-P, we have also disrupted epf in all of the three genetic backgrounds. The strains were grown on solid LB either at optimal (37°C) and low (24°C) temperatures (Figure 8). In contrast to E. coli, we see no synthetic phenotype in ΔbipA ΔyfmR double-deletion strain. However, the ΔbipA Δepf strain has a strong phenotype. At 37°C, while there is no clear growth defenct, the colonies are slightly translucent; at 24°C, the synthetic growth defect is clearly evident. Given the functional analogues between EF-P and YfmR/Uup, the phenotype is analogous to that we have earlier observed for Δuup Δepf E. coli (33).
