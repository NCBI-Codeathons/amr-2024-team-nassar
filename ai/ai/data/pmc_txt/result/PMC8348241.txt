Results Pitohui poison birds and poison frogs have BTX-sensitive NaVs Pitohui is one of only a few bird genera known to carry BTX (Dumbacher et al., 1992; Dumbacher et al., 2000; Menon and Dumbacher, 2014) and has BTX levels in its skeletal and cardiac muscles that should alter NaV function (∼5 and ∼20 µM, respectively; Dumbacher et al., 2009; MacKenzie et al., 2021
Preprint). To investigate possible mechanisms of BTX resistance, we used a Pitohui genomic DNA library to identify and assemble genes for Pum skeletal muscle NaV1.4 (Fig. S1) and cardiac Pum NaV1.5 (Fig. S2). Primary sequence alignment showed extensive similarities between Pum NaV1.4, Pum NaV1.5, and other vertebrate homologues (∼73% amino acid identity; Figs. S1 and S2), including hallmark NaV features such as a selectivity filter aspartate-glutamate-lysine-alanine (DEKA) motif, canonical RXXR repeats in S4 in all four voltage sensor domains, and the isoleucine-​phenylalanine-methionine (IFM) motif responsible for fast inactivation (Catterall et al., 2020).

Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of Pum NaV1.4 and Pum NaV1.5 transfected into HEK293 cells demonstrated that both have fast voltage-dependent activation followed by a fast and complete voltage-dependent inactivation typical of NaVs (Fig. 1, a and b; Fig. S3, a and b; Table 1; and Table S1), similar to Hs NaV1.4 recorded under identical conditions (Fig. 1, c and d; Table 1; and Table S1). Because NaVs can harbor resistance mutations to other small-molecule toxins (Arbuckle et al., 2017; Almabruk et al., 2018; Geffeney et al., 2002; Bricelj et al., 2005), we anticipated that the Pitohui NaVs might be BTX resistant. Surprisingly, application of 10 µM BTX, a concentration comparable to that found in Pitohui muscle (Dumbacher et al., 2009), drastically altered the function of both Pum NaVs, yielding typical BTX-induced functional consequences: a hyperpolarized shift in the voltage dependency of activation (ΔV1/2 BTX = −33.6 ± 1.2 and −37.4 ± 1.8 mV for Pum NaV1.4 and Pum NaV1.5, respectively), reduced inactivation, and enhanced tail currents (Khodorov, 1985; Logan et al., 2016; Fig. 1, a and b; Fig. S3, a and b; and Table 1). The BTX-induced activation curve follows a double Boltzmann function in which the first and second components arise from BTX-bound and unmodified channels, respectively (Du et al., 2011). Notably, the BTX-induced changes were equivalent to those elicited by BTX application to Hs NaV1.4 (ΔV1/2 BTX = −35.9 ± 1.8 mV; Fig. 1 d and Table 1). NaVs are often coexpressed with auxiliary β-subunits that can alter their biophysical (Calhoun and Isom, 2014) and pharmacological (Gilchrist et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2013) properties. To test whether this subunit could affect BTX resistance, we identified the Pum gene encoding for a transmembrane protein bearing the key features of NaVβ2 (Das et al., 2016; Fig. S3 c). Cotransfection of Pum NaVβ2 with Pum NaV1.4 had no impact on channel biophysical properties or on BTX responses (Fig. S3, d and e; Table 1; and Table S1). Thus, Pum NaV1.4 alone and Pum NaV1.4 in combination with Pum NaVβ2 failed to show evidence of BTX-resistant channels. Together, these data demonstrate that even though Pitohui carry BTX in their skeletal muscles and heart (Dumbacher et al., 2009), their skeletal and cardiac NaVs are BTX sensitive. Thus, autoresistance cannot originate from altered BTX sensitivity in the two most likely targets exposed to lethal BTX levels.

Poison frogs in the genus Phyllobates (family Dendrobatidae) are the most well-known BTX carriers (Albuquerque et al., 1971; Santos et al., 2016; Albuquerque et al., 1973). A number of studies have identified amino acid substitutions hypothesized to contribute to poison frog NaV BTX resistance (Tarvin et al., 2016; Márquez et al., 2019; Wang and Wang, 2017). We cloned poison frog NaV1.4 from the skeletal muscle from captivity-raised members of two representative poison frog species, one that carries high BTX levels in the wild, Phyllobates terribilis (Pt NaV1.4) (Tarvin et al., 2016; Daly et al., 1980; Myers et al., 1978), and one not known to carry BTX, Dendrobates tinctorius (Dt NaV1.4) (Daly et al., 1987). Consistent with evolutionary relationships between the two species (Tarvin et al., 2016; Márquez et al., 2019), Pt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1.4 were highly similar to each other (∼95% amino acid identity) and other vertebrate NaVs (∼73% amino acid identity), and bore all NaV hallmark features (Fig. S1). Importantly, their DIS6 and DIVS6 sequences were identical to those reported previously (Tarvin et al., 2016) with the remarkable absence in Pt NaV1.4 of the proposed BTX resistance mutation DIVS6 N→T (Pt NaV1.4 Asn1600, Pt NaV1.4 N1584T [rat numbering]; Wang and Wang, 2017; Fig. S1; Table S2). Genomic DNA sequencing covering the Pt NaV1.4 DIVS6 yielded nucleotide sequences identical to those obtained from cDNA and cross-validated the absence of the DIVS6 N→T substitution. These findings are consistent with the observation that the DIVS6 N1600T substitution has a very low frequency among P. terribilis (Márquez et al., 2019). Besides the prior reported amino acid variants (Tarvin et al., 2016), Pt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1.4 differed from bird, human, and rat NaV1.4 at an additional 93 positions distributed throughout the channel (Fig. 2 and Table S2). Although we could readily sequence the Pt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1.4 genes, both proved prone to recombination upon passage through Escherichia coli, rendering the native DNA sequences impossible to handle. To solve this problem, we redesigned the codon usage to preserve the amino acid sequence of both. These redesigned genes were well behaved and allowed us to conduct electrophysiological characterization of Pt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1.4 in mammalian and amphibian expression systems.

Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of HEK293 cells transfected with Pt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1.4 yielded voltage-dependent channels that matched the properties of Pum and Hs NaV1.4s (Fig. 1, e–h; Table 1; and Table S1). Strikingly, both poison frog NaVs had the same response to 10 µM BTX as Pum and Hs NaV1.4 (Fig. 1, e–h; ΔV1/2 BTX = −30.0 ± 2.1 and −37.9 ± 2.0 mV for Pt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1.4, respectively). Even though the expression levels of both frog channels were lower than those for the Pitohui or human channels, rendering their biophysical characterization less accurate, we found no evidence for NaVs in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1 i and Table 1). We further examined the response of Dt NaV1.4 in a second system, CHO cells, and found similarly low, BTX-responsive NaV currents that were absent from mock-transfected cells (Fig. S4, a, b, e, and f; and Table 1), giving confidence that the measured activity indeed arises from the frog NaVs. Hence, these results demonstrate that these poison frog channels are not resistant to BTX and rule out the possibility that the >90 amino acid differences between poison frog and human channels, including the previously proposed changes in DIS6 and DIVS6 (Tarvin et al., 2016), could confer BTX resistance. Notably, the response of the Pt NaV1.4 to BTX reveals a BTX sensitivity evoked by a BTX concentration (10 µM) that is well below that found in wild P. terribilis (∼170 µM; Myers et al., 1978).

Because expression of amphibian channels in an amphibian cell could provide a more native-like context, we also expressed Pt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1.4 in Xenopus oocytes and examined their function by two-electrode voltage clamping. Both channels had biophysical parameters that matched those measured in mammalian cells (Fig. S4, g–j; and Table 1). Furthermore, BTX application caused the strong hallmark functional modification observed for all of the other channels we studied (Fig. 1; Fig. S3, a, b, d, and e; and Fig. S4, a–d), including voltage-dependent activation shifts comparable to those measured in mammalian cells (ΔV1/2 BTX = −33.1 ± 3.2 and −30.0 ± 2.1 and −37.8 ± 6.1 and −37.9 ± 2.0 mV for Pt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1.4 expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells, respectively). The shift was more complete in oocytes (cf. Fig. 1, f and h; and Fig. S4, h and j). This result likely originates from the fact that, for technical reasons, due to the large extracellular solution volumes used in the oocyte experiments that would require prohibitively large quantities of BTX, this toxin was injected into the oocytes rather than applied by bath application as it was for mammalian cells. Our observation that NaVs from two classes of BTX-carrying animals, Pitohui and P. terribilis, are not BTX resistant challenges the idea that NaV mutation is the BTX autoresistance strategy as suggested for poison frogs such as P. terribilis (Tarvin et al., 2016; Wang and Wang, 2017). DIVS6 N→T mutation fails to confer BTX resistance to poison frog NaVs Because the DIVS6 N→T mutation was absent from NaVs of BTX-bearing species, we wondered whether the observation that DIVS6 N→T could confer BTX resistance to rat NaV1.4 (Wang and Wang, 2017) was impacted by the >90 amino acid differences between poison frog and mammalian NaVs (Fig. 2 and Table S2). Therefore, we placed the DIVS6 N→T mutation in poison bird, human, and poison frog NaV1.4s (Pum NaV1.4 N1609T, Hs NaV1.4 N1591T, Pt NaV1.4 N1600T, and Dt NaV1.4 N6100T) and measured its effects on channel function and BTX sensitivity. Consistent with studies of rat NaV1.4 DIVS6 N→T (Wang and Wang, 2017), DIVS6 N→T eliminated the ability of BTX to block inactivation and induce large tail currents in Pum NaV1.4 and Hs NaV1.4 (Fig. 3, a–d). Nevertheless, the bird and human NaV1.4s were not rendered completely BTX resistant. Application of 10 µM BTX shifted the voltage-dependent activation of both channels, making them more easily opened by voltage (ΔV1/2 BTX = −11.4 ± 3.2 and −14.2 ± 5.5 mV for Pum NaV1.4 N1609T and Hs NaV1.4 N1591T, respectively; Fig. 3, b and d; and Table 1). Furthermore, the BTX-induced double Boltzmann was lost (Fig. 3, b and d), suggesting an enhanced BTX affinity. Due to its limited effectiveness in blocking the effects of BTX in the bird and human channels, we revisited the consequences of the DIVS6 N→T mutation in Rn NaV1.4. Similar to the bird and human channel results, DIVS6 N→T reduced but did not eliminate Rn NaV1.4 BTX sensitivity (Fig. S5, a–d). Application of 10 µM BTX shifted the voltage-dependent activation of both Rn NaV1.4 and Rn NaV1.4 N1584T, making them more easily opened by voltage (ΔV1/2 BTX = −45.6 ± 0.4 and −40.3 ± 2.8 mV for Rn NaV1.4 and Rn NaV1.4 N1584T, respectively; Fig. S5, b and d; and Table 1). Thus, DIVS6 N→T was unable to mitigate the effects of BTX completely in any NaV orthologue.

In all three contexts, DIVS6 N→T also affected channel biophysical properties (Fig. S5, e–g; Fig. S6, a–h; Tables 1 and 2; and Table S1). DIVS6 N→T rendered Pum NaV1.4, Hs NaV1.4, and Rn NaV1.4 more difficult to open, shifting the activation voltage dependence to depolarizing potentials (ΔV1/2 = +20.5 ± 1.5, +16.9 ± 2.7, and +18.0 ± 0.6 mV for Pum NaV1.4 N1609T, Hs NaV1.4 N1591T, and Rn NaV1.4 N1584T, respectively; Fig. S5 e; Fig. S6, b and f; and Tables 1 and 2), and made the channels easier to inactivate, shifting the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation toward hyperpolarizing potentials (ΔV1/2 inact = −10.3 ± 2.1, −9.8 ± 1.2, and −27.0 ± 0.4 mV for Pum NaV1.4 N1609T, Hs NaV1.4 N1591T, and Rn NaV1.4 N1584T, respectively; Fig. S5 f; Fig. S6, c and g; Table 2; and Table S1). Furthermore, DIVS6 N→T diminished Pum NaV1.4 N1609T, Hs NaV1.4 N1591T, and Rn NaV1.4 N1584T current densities by 79%, 55%, and 90%, respectively (Fig. S5, a, c, and g; Fig. S6, a, d, e, and h; and Tables 1 and 2). Thus, the DIVS6 N→T change incurs a substantial functional cost.

ΔV1/2 act = V1/2, act mutant -V1/2, act WT. ΔV1/2 inact = V1/2, inact mutant -V1/2, inact WT. To probe the DIVS6 Asn site further, we examined the consequences of mutation to alanine in Pum NaV1.4. Pum NaV1.4 N1609A phenocopied the biophysical changes measured for N1609T, producing channels that were more difficult to open (ΔV1/2 = +19.6 ± 1.6 mV) and easier to inactivate (ΔV1/2 inact = −13.4 ± 1.6 mV) and that had current density reduced by 76% (Fig. S6, a–d; Tables 1 and 2; and Table S1), in agreement with the reduced channel activity reported for the corresponding Rn NaV1.4 mutant (Wang et al., 1997; Sheets et al., 2015). These biophysical changes match those of the BTX-resistant Pum NaV1.4 N1609T; however, Pum NaV1.4 N1609A retained all of the classical BTX responses such as reduction of inactivation, enhanced tail current, and a leftward shift of the activation voltage dependence (Fig. S6, i and j; and Tables 1 and 2). The failure of the N1609A to diminish BTX sensitivity shows that the reduction of BTX sensitivity in Pum NaV1.4 N1609T, Hs NaV1.4 N1591T, and Rn NaV1.4 N1584T is a specific effect of the threonine mutation and not a consequence of the changes in channel biophysical properties or current density reduction (Table 2). To our surprise, placing DIVS6 N→T in both poison frog NaV1.4s failed to blunt the effects of BTX on channel activation and inactivation (Fig. 3, e–h; ΔV1/2 BTX = −30.0 ± 2.1 and −30.8 ± 2.5 mV for Pt NaV1.4 and Pt NaV1.4 N1600T, respectively, and −37.9 ± 2.0 and −37.8 ± 1.8 for Dt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1.4 N1600T, respectively). Similar results were obtained for Dt NaV1.4 N1600T measured in a second expression system, CHO cells (Fig. S4, c, d, and f). Hence, even though the DIVS6 N→T change reduces Pum NaV1.4, Hs NaV1.4, and Rn NaV1.4 BTX responses (Fig. 3, a–d; and Fig. S5, a–d), this same change fails to affect the BTX sensitivity of poison frog NaVs. Unlike its effects in Pum, Hs, and Rn NaVs, DIVS6 N→T did not cause major changes in poison frog NaV biophysical properties, shifting only the inactivation voltage dependence by −10 mV while leaving the activation voltage dependence and current density unchanged (Fig. S7, a–c; Tables 1 and 2; and Table S1). Additionally, expression of Pt NaV1.4 N1600T and Dt NaV1.4 N1600T in Xenopus oocytes revealed dramatic reductions in channel activity (Fig. S7, d–h). This ∼10-fold reduction in current amplitude prevented measurement of channel biophysical properties and BTX responses, especially because in the case of the latter, the intracellular injection of BTX necessary for the oocyte experiments induces a leak current that is similar to the amplitude of the N1600T mutants. Nevertheless, these results reveal that DIVS6 N→T is detrimental to function and may interfere with channel folding and maturation in a manner that is accentuated at lower temperatures, such as those used to store the oocytes. This context-dependent loss of function indicates that the DIVS6 N→T variant exacts a functional cost that, together with its ineffectiveness in endowing poison frog NaVs with BTX resistance, challenges the idea that DIVS6 N→T could serve as an effective BTX autoresistance mechanism.

Cost of the conserved N→T mutation is context dependent The varied outcomes of DIVS6 N→T on BTX sensitivity among the poison bird, human, rat, and poison frog NaVs highlight the importance of context in determining the functional consequences of mutations. Because the equivalent residue is conserved in all four S6 helices (Figs. S1 and S2), we systematically introduced S6 N→T into each of the Pum NaV1.4 S6 segments and measured channel properties and BTX responses to investigate the question of context-dependent effects further (Fig. 4). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from HEK293 cells transfected with these mutant channels revealed clear, domain-specific differences. Contrasting the effect of DIVS6 N→T (Fig. S6 b), voltage-dependent activation of channels having the N→T mutation in DI, DII, or DIII (Pum NaV1.4 N432T [DI], Pum NaV1.4 N830T [DII], and Pum NaV1.4 N1306T [DIII]) was unchanged relative to WT (V1/2 = −20.2 ± 1.9, −22.4 ± 1.0, −26.7 ± 1.0, and −23.4 ± 1.0 mV for Pum NaV1.4 N432T [DI], Pum NaV1.4 N830T [DII], Pum NaV1.4 N1306T [DIII], and Pum NaV1.4, respectively; Fig. 4, a–j; Fig. S8, a and b; and Tables 1 and 2). By contrast, we found varied effects on steady-state inactivation. DI and DIII changes showed WT-like behavior, whereas the DII mutant had an ∼10-mV hyperpolarizing shift (V1/2 inact = −61.2 ± 1.6, −75.0 ± 0.9, −65.3 ± 1.0, and −64.2 ± 1.3 mV for Pum NaV1.4 N432T [DI], Pum NaV1.4 N830T [DII], Pum NaV1.4 N1306T [DIII], and Pum NaV1.4, respectively; Fig. S8 c, Table 2, and Table S1). All three had strong BTX responses similar to WT (ΔV1/2 BTX = −30.8 ± 2.1, −31.6 ± 2.0, −36.9 ± 1.4, and −33.6 ± 1.2 mV for Pum NaV1.4 N432T [DI], Pum NaV1.4 N830T [DII], Pum NaV1.4 N1306T [DIII], and Pum NaV1.4, respectively; Fig. 4 and Tables 1 and 2). Thus, the only site where the conserved S6 N→T change affects BTX responses is in DIVS6, in line with its proposed contribution to the BTX binding site (Wang and Wang, 2017).

As with the biophysical changes, the effects on current density from placing the N→T change in different channel domains were not uniform. The DIS6 and DIIIS6 N→T mutants had current densities matching WT (Fig. 4, a, c, and g; Fig. S8, a and d; and Tables 1 and 2), whereas, DIIS6 N→T lowered the current density and was more detrimental to channel activity than DIVS6 N1609T or N1609A (Fig. 4, a and e; Fig. S8, a and d; and Tables 1 and 2). Together, these data show that there is no correlation between changes in channel biophysical properties and the acquisition of BTX resistance and are in line with the results from DIVS6 N→T and N→A mutants (Figs. 3, S6, and S7, and Table 2). Consideration of the conserved S6 asparagine structural locale provides insight into the context-dependent effects. The two S6 sites where N→T has no impact on channel biophysics, BTX responses, or current density, DIS6 and DIIIS6, occupy positions that are partially exposed to the channel inner pore (Fig. S8, e and f). By contrast, the two positions that affect channel biophysics and current density, DIIS6 and DIVS6, interact with the S4–S5 linkers (Pan et al., 2018; Fig. S8, e and f), and altering these buried sites comes with substantial functional costs. Hence, DIVS6 N→T carries major disadvantages for protecting animals such as Pitohui and poison frogs against BTX autointoxication. Toxin-free poison frogs have BTX- and STX-sensitive NaVs but are resistant to both toxins The surprising observation that NaVs from BTX-carrying birds and frogs remain BTX sensitive raised the question whether the species from which we cloned the channels were actually BTX resistant. Because of difficulties in obtaining live animals, we were unable to investigate Pitohui BTX resistance. Captivity-raised poison frogs lack BTX because this toxin is acquired in the wild from their diet (Daly et al., 1994b; Daly et al., 1994a). Thus, it was possible that the toxin-free poison frogs used to clone NaVs were not BTX resistant due to the absence of selective pressure from the toxin, a possibility underscored by the high functional cost of DIVS6 N→T (Fig. 3, e–h; Fig. S7; Tables 1 and 2; and Table S1). To test whether captivity-raised poison frogs were BTX resistant, we conducted a series of toxin challenge experiments using five different frog species: two nonpoisonous frogs (Xenopus and Polypedates
leucomystax), two captivity-raised dendrobatid poison frogs that carry alkaloid toxins in the wild (P. terribilis, BTX; and D. tinctorius, HTX and PTX), and an unrelated captivity-raised Malagasy poison frog that carries PTX rather than BTX in the wild (M. aurantiaca) and that represents an independent evolutionary origin of chemical defenses (Daly et al., 2005; Daly et al., 2008; Garraffo et al., 1993). We challenged these animals with three different toxins that target NaVs: BTX and two guanidinium toxins that act by a pore-blocking mechanism, STX (Thottumkara et al., 2014; Durán-Riveroll and Cembella, 2017) and TTX (Durán-Riveroll and Cembella, 2017). We assessed the duration of recovery from anesthesia-induced paralysis after intramuscular injection of each toxin at 20 times the lethal dose based on values for mice (LD50) by monitoring how long it took the frog to show clear motor activity relative to injection of a PBS control. After BTX injection, Xenopus and P. leucomystax displayed an accelerated recovery from anesthesia that was at least two times faster than that with PBS injections (PBS and BTX recovery times: 29 ± 1 min and 15 ± 5 min and 169 ± 12 min and 70 ± 20 min for Xenopus and Phyllobates leucomystax, respectively; Fig. 5, a, b, and f; and Table S3). After the initial recovery, BTX was ultimately lethal to Xenopus (Fig. 5, a and f). By contrast, BTX injection did not change the anesthesia recovery time or kill any of the poison frogs, regardless of whether they carry BTX in the wild (P. terribilis) or are naturally BTX free but harbor other alkaloid toxins (D. tinctorius, M. aurantiaca; Fig. 5, c–f; and Table S3). Reponses to STX also revealed differences between nonpoisonous and poisonous frogs. STX injection was lethal to Xenopus and P. leucomystax (Fig. 5, a, b, and f), whereas all three poison frogs fully recovered from anesthesia after STX injections (Fig. 5, c–f). TTX was lethal to Xenopus (Fig. 5, a and f). Although TTX caused extended paralysis in all other tested frogs, it was not lethal (Fig. 5, a–f; and Table S3). Thus, all tested poisonous frogs showed resistance to all three toxins, whereas nonpoisonous frogs were vulnerable to either BTX and STX (P. leucomystax) or all three toxins (Xenopus; Fig. 5 f).

The striking differences in BTX-induced accelerated recovery from anesthesia between the nonpoisonous and poisonous species was unexpected. Studies of eukaryotic and prokaryotic NaVs suggest that BTX and local anesthetics, such as the tricaine used for frog anesthesia, have overlapping binding sites within the channel pore (Finol-Urdaneta et al., 2019; Wang and Wang, 1992; Wang et al., 1994; Wang and Wang, 1994). We considered that the differences in BTX-dependent accelerated recovery from anesthesia were a physiological manifestation of this molecular competition and indicated that BTX was engaging the target channels in nonpoisonous frogs but not in poisonous frogs. Hence, we tested whether tricaine and BTX produced competing effects on Pt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1. 4. Consistent with its anesthetic effects on the frogs, 0.5 mM tricaine inhibited both poison frog NaVs and had similar effects on the Pum NaV1.4 control (Fig. 6, a–c and g). Subsequent BTX injection into the same tricaine-treated oocytes caused complete relief of the tricaine block (Fig. 6, a–c and g), in line with a direct competition between tricaine and BTX. By contrast, in the absence of tricaine, this dramatic BTX-induced increase in peak current was absent (Fig. 6, d–f and h). These data demonstrate that the poison frog NaVs are competent for BTX–tricaine competition. Hence, the differences in BTX-induced accelerated recovery from anesthesia reflect the direct competition of the two compounds on the channel in the nonpoisonous frogs and suggest that the poisonous frogs have a means to prevent BTX from engaging their NaVs. Figure 6.BTX competes with anesthetic agent tricaine in NaVs from poisonous species. (a–c) Exemplar two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) recordings at 0 mV in control (black), after 0.5 mM tricaine application (orange), and after BTX injection (dark green) into the same Xenopus oocytes expressing Pt NaV1.4 (a), Dt NaV1.4 (b), and Pum NaV1.4 (c). BTX injection was performed after tricaine block of sodium current, and the recordings of the BTX effect were made while the oocyte was still exposed to tricaine.

(g and h) Average peak current amplitudes normalized to the corresponding control peak current amplitude for tricaine and BTX (g) and BTX alone (h). The poison frog STX resistance we observed could be explained by a lack of NaV sensitivity to this toxin. To test this possibility, we compared the responses of Pt NaV1.4, Dt NaV1.4, and Pum NaV1.4 as a control to STX and TTX because the former had minimal effect on the poison frogs, whereas the latter caused potent paralysis (Fig. 5 and Table S3). Extracellular application of increasing STX concentrations inhibited all three NaVs with a nanomolar response that matched that of other NaVs (Thomas-Tran and Du Bois, 2016; Thottumkara et al., 2014; Andresen and Du Bois, 2009; IC50 = 12.6 ± 1.4 nM, 14.6 ± 0.6 nM, and 7.3 ± 0.5 nM for Pt NaV1.4, Dt NaV1.4, and Pum NaV1.4, respectively; Fig. 7, a–d). Pt NaV1.4 and Dt NaV1.4 and the control Pum NaV1.4 also had nanomolar TTX responses, similar to Hs NaV1.4 (Chahine et al., 1994; IC50 = 21.3 ± 1.0 nM, 40.8 ± 1.8 nM, and 6.2 ± 0.4 nM for Pt NaV1.4, Dt NaV1.4, and Pum NaV1.4, respectively; Fig. 7, e–h). Thus, the ability of the poison frogs to resist STX does not arise from their NaVs having some unusual resistance to the toxin (Figs. 5 and 7 d and Table S3). The resistance of poison frogs to the effects of BTX and STX contrasts with the effects of TTX and is not consistent with the high sensitivity of their NaV1.4s to all three toxins. These findings suggest that mechanisms such as toxin sequestration may prevent BTX and STX from reaching their target NaVs. Figure 7.NaV1.4s from poisonous animals are STX and TTX sensitive.

An amphibian “toxin sponge” protein protects NaVs from toxin action The toxin challenge experiments indicated that BTX and STX were unable to affect poison frog NaVs, even though the channels are perfectly sensitive to both toxins (Figs. 5 and 7 d, and Table S3). Although there is yet no known BTX binding protein, a high-affinity soluble 91 kD STX-binding protein from frog plasma, Sxph, has been well characterized and shown to bind STX but not TTX (Mahar et al., 1991; Yen et al., 2019; Llewellyn and Moczydlowski, 1994; Morabito and Moczydlowski, 1994). Hence, we asked whether Sxph, which has a Kd for STX that is comparable to that of the channel (Mahar et al., 1991; Doyle et al., 1982; Llewellyn and Moczydlowski, 1994), would be capable of protecting NaVs from the action of STX. Application of solutions preequilibrated with different Sxph:STX molar ratios showed that Sxph was able to protect completely Pt NaV expressed in Xenopus oocytes from STX inhibition once the ratio reached 2:1 Sxph:STX (Fig. 8, a and b). Furthermore, application of Sxph to cells expressing Pt NaVs that had been preblocked with STX yielded the same result and demonstrated that Sxph is able to compete effectively with the channel for the toxin (Fig. 8, c–e; and Fig. S9, a–f). Importantly, Sxph had no effect against the related guanidinium toxin TTX (Fig. 8, e and f; and Fig. S9, g and h), a toxin that does not bind Sxph (Mahar et al., 1991). Hence, these experiments demonstrate that high-affinity toxin sponge proteins are able to prevent the actions of small-molecule toxins that target NaVs and lend further support to the idea that toxin sequestration mechanisms may act to protect poisonous animals from autointoxication.
