Results Epoxyketone Peptides Production by Streptomyces sp. BRA-346 Under Laboratory Conditions BRA-346 is a slow growing Actinobacteria, which achieves the stationary phase after at least 3 days of laboratory growth in highly aerated liquid cultures. Secondary metabolite production is expected by day 7, with epoxyketone peptides production by BRA-346 being culture and medium-dependent (Figure 2). Figure 2The biosynthesis of BRA-346 secondary metabolites is tightly regulated by the culture media used for bacteria growth.

MS/MS spectra detected in the crude extracts are shown as the network nodes. For clarity, only the MS/MS spectra pointed as the protonated ion ([M + H]+) and nodes with at least one connection (self-loops and single nodes were removed) are shown. The MS/MS spectra were annotated by spectra matches with UNPD-ISDB and GNPS databases, visually inspected and compared to literature data.

(D) Detail of the epoxyketone peptide MS/MS cluster extracted from the SSMN shown in (A). (E) EIC of m/z 401.26 ± 0.01 in the four BRA-346 cultures in the A1 medium. To exemplify this statement, four replicates of BRA-346 cultures in the A1 medium, the standard growth medium for BRA-346 (Furtado et al., 2021), were carried out (A1 C3a-c and A1 C5), in addition to the use of three different culture media (ISP2, TSBY, and TSB; Supplementary Table S2), in a total of seven culture conditions evaluated in this data set. The metabolome was assessed by LC–MS/MS analyses, being further evaluated by the construction and inspection of a spectra similarity molecular network (SSMN) of the representative [M + H]+ ions (de Felício et al., 2021; Figure 2A). Notably, BRA-346 metabolome is shifted towards different classes of secondary metabolites, depending on the culture media used (Figures 2A,B). Specifically, the production of the target epoxyketone peptides was upregulated in the cultures using the A1 medium and downregulated when the other culture media were applied (Figures 2A,C). The downregulation of epoxyketone peptide production is concomitant with the overexpression of lipopeptides and macrolactams in the ISP2 and TSBY culture media (Figure 2A). In addition, the A1 C5 culture also presented a reduced diversity of epoxyketone peptides (Figures 2D,E), which was in turn aligned with an increase detection of lipopeptides, macrolides, and carotenoids (Figure 2A). The epoxyketone peptide cluster containing 1 and 3 is highlighted in Figure 2D, spotting DHE (1, m/z 401.26) and DH-TMC (3, m/z 345.20). Two ions of m/z 401.26, which were clustered together in the SSMN, presented different retention times in the reverse-phase liquid chromatography (6.6 min and 7.4 min; Figure 2E). Their fragmentation spectra (Supplementary Figure S5) are similar (cosine = 0.88), suggesting that these ions represent stereoisomers. It is also important to comment that the bioactive epoxyketone peptide eponemycin (2, m/z 399.25), which was previously identified in BRA-346 cultures in low yields (Furtado et al., 2021), was not detected in the crude extracts of BRA-346 cultures presented here (Supplementary Figures S6, S7). In addition, TMC-86A (4, m/z 343.19), was identified in trace amounts (Supplementary Figure S8). Knowing that 1 and 3 are biosynthetic intermediates of 2 (Schorn et al., 2014) and 4 (Zabala et al., 2016), respectively, it is possible that the last step of 2 and 4 biosynthesis in wild type BRA-346 is not being completed under the growth conditions used. Chemical Elicitors Induced Epoxyketone Production by BRA-346 In a further attempt to elicit secondary metabolite production by BRA-346, especially epoxyketone peptides, we used chemical elicitors in A1 cultures. This was done following precedents in the literature that some chemicals, as sodium butyrate (reviewed by Tomm et al., 2019), can act as epigenetic modulators, in addition to mimetics of the presence of competing organisms, as antibiotics produced by other micro-organisms (Abdelmohsen et al., 2015; de Felício et al., 2021). Following the approach described by de Felício et al. (2021) we tested several chemical elicitors in solid media, and selected ampicillin (100 μg/ml), sodium butyrate (50 μM), and procaine (100 μM) for eliciting BRA-346 secondary metabolites in A1 liquid medium. The metabolites were extracted, and the crude extracts were analysed by LC–MS/MS and SSMN (Supplementary Figure S9). The experiments (C5) were carried out in parallel, in the same incubator, and following the same procedures. In addition, the crude extracts were purified using C-8 cartridges and the water/methanol fractions (F50) were further analyzed (Figure 3). Figure 3Chemical elicitors, especially ampicillin, induce the production of epoxyketone peptides by BRA-346. (A) SSMN of BRA-346 cultures using the A1 medium and different chemical elicitors [no elicitor, as a control, (i); ampicillin 100 μg/ml (ii); sodium butyrate 50 μM (iii); procaine 100 μM (iv)].

Chromatograms of the crude extract and F50 fractions samples are represented in purple and cyan, respectively. It is worth noticing that 1 was produced in higher amounts in the ampicillin elicited cultures (Figure 3D), and TMC-86A (4), which had not been previously detected or sporadically detected in trace amounts (Figure 3C), was detected in the crude extracts and enriched in the F50 fraction of the ampicillin growth condition (Figure 3B). These results indicated that BRA-346 could produce 4, one of the expected final products of epoxyketone biosynthesis in Streptomyces bacteria. However, its production might be tightly regulated in BRA-346 and can be upregulated by an antibiotic chemical elicitor. Analysing the groups of metabolites modulated by the chemical elicitors (Supplementary Figure S9), ampicillin increased epoxyketone and downregulated macrolides, terpenes, and diketopiperazines/alkaloids. Procaine, on the other hand, exerted an opposite effect, downregulating epoxyketone peptides and upregulating the three other major groups (macrolides, terpenes, and diketopiperazines/alkaloids). Macrolactams were not observed and just a small group of lipopeptides was observed. Draft Genome Sequence of Streptomyces BRA-346 Our efforts to understand epoxyketone biosynthesis and regulation by Streptomyces BRA-346 were further assisted by genome sequencing and mining, going beyond this class of secondary metabolites. BRA-346 draft genome contains 10 Mb and was presented on 180 contigs with 8,706 predicted coding genes. BRA-346 genome mining and annotation using antiSMASH (Blin et al., 2021) show the presence of 66 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Although this is a draft genome, and some clusters are fragmented or duplicated, it was possible to find 35 complete BGCs encoding for ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), epoxyketone peptides, terpenes, ectoines, siderophores, non-ribosomal peptides (NRP) or polyketides (PK; Supplementary Table S6). In addition, 31 truncated BGCs encoding for PK or NRP were also annotated. This reflects a broad biosynthetic capacity of BRA-346, which is mostly hidden under laboratory conditions. By applying the OSMAC (one strain many compounds) approach, using specific growth conditions (e.g., culture media—Figure 2A; Supplementary Table S4; and chemical elicitors—Figure 3; Supplementary Figure S9), we were able to reveal the different classes of secondary metabolites produced by this bacterium. Some of the BGCs annotated in BRA-346 draft genome could be linked to the metabolites presented in the SSMN (Figure 2A), providing additional insights into BRA-346 regulation and metabolic shifts. In the regulatory perspective, the draft genome of Streptomyces BRA-346 shows a myriad of transcription regulators, which may be involved in the regulation of the specialized metabolism of BRA-346 under laboratory conditions. We highlight 70 LuxR-type transcription regulators, 118 TetR-type regulators, 2 gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) BGCs (region 35.1, candidate BGC = 11 kb; and region 2.1, candidate BGC = 11 kb, Supplementary Table S6; Supplementary Figure S10), which might be of particular importance for understanding BRA-346 regulation and, potentially quorum sensing. For lipopeptides, which were evidenced in BRA-346 cultures using TSBY/ISP2 media (Figure 2A), a truncated NRPS BGC was found in contig 32 harboring the assembly line characteristic of lipopeptides, thus linking the metabolites detected by LC–MS/MS to BRA-346 genome. This BGC (region 32.1, candidate BGC 35 kb; Supplementary Table S6) contains a N-terminal acyl ligase domain, which is associated with lipopeptide biosynthesis (Kersten et al., 2011), in addition to NRPS modules. It further shares sequence similarity with Streptomyces RTd22 (Chagas et al., 2016) and ATCC53653 BGCs, the latter reported previously as a producer of stendomycin lipopeptides—Supplementary Figures S11, S12; Supplementary Table S5 (Kersten et al., 2011; Villadsen et al., 2018). A complex regulatory system is found within this BGC, which harbours TetR, LysR, sensor histidine kinase, SARP, and LuxR regulators. Macrolactams, exemplified by heronamide B (with related ORFs present in two truncated regions: region 2.1, candidate BGC = 11 kb and region 63.1, candidate BGC = 27 kb; Supplementary Table S6) could also be linked to the BRA-346 metabolome (Figure 2A). This class of natural products was also only observed in the TSBY/ISP2 cultures. This BGC also presents a complex regulatory system with TetR, LuxR, LacI, AraC, SARP, and an AsfA butyrolactone producing gene. Diketopiperazines, related to bicyclomycin (region 3.2, candidate BGC 43 kb), and carotenoids, related to isorenieratene (region 34.1, candidate BGC 21 kb), annotated at the SSMN (Figure 2A), were additionally located in BRA-346 draft genome (Supplementary Table S6). Bicyclomycin could be linked to an alkaloid/diketopiperazine SSMN cluster expressed in the ISP2 medium; whereas carotenoids were mostly observed in the TSBY and A1C5 cultures (Figure 2A) and in A1 cultures induced with procaine (Supplementary Figure S9). Curiously, these differentially expressed BGCs are also under the control of TetR (Table 1), a family of transcription factors, generally repressors, regulated by gamma-butyrolactones (GBL; Cuthbertson and Nodwell, 2013).

The assigned natural product class is given according to LC–MS/MS characteristics and spectra matches with databases. The regulatory systems are predicted from BRA-346 draft genome. TetR repressors and activators were suggested according to the position of the HTH domain (C-terminal HTH = activators, N-terminal HTH = repressors; Cuthbertson and Nodwell, 2013). Culture media. Chemical elicitors (in A1 medium) regulating the assigned natural product classes are also provided. Metabolic groups were assigned (G1, G2, or G3) as indicated. For the epoxyketone peptides, mostly observed when BRA-346 was grown in the A1 medium (cultures C3 a–c, Figure 2) or upregulated in the presence of ampicillin (Figure 3; Supplementary Figure S9), a single complete BGC was found (BGC number 42.1, Supplementary Table S6). The BGC, herein named epn/tmc, is predicted to contain 25 open reading frames (ORFs). From these, 12 ORFs are related to previously reported eponemycin, epn (Schorn et al., 2014) and TMC-86A, tmc (Zabala et al., 2016) epoxyketone gene clusters (Figure 4; Supplementary Table S7). This BGC has a simpler regulatory system, compared to the BGCs presented above, with only one LuxR-type transcription factor (epn/tmcA) and TTA codons.

Heterologous Expression of the epn/tmc BGC From BRA-346 Although eponemycin (2) and TMC-86A (4) BGCs in Streptomyces bacteria have been already described in the literature, these BGCs were individually reported as producers of eponemycin or TMC-86A natural products. BRA-346 was shown to produce both 1 and 3, the last step biosynthetic intermediates of 2 and 4, suggesting multiple epoxyketone BGCs or a multifunctional BGC. In addition, we found the production of these specialized metabolites is tightly regulated in wild type BRA-346 and influenced by its metabolic shifts, limiting their full obtention for additional studies. We then cloned the epn/tmc BGC of BRA-346 using the transformation-associated recombination (TAR) approach (Zhang et al., 2019; Sigrist et al., 2020), inserting the target BGC under the control of a strong promoter into a S. coelicolor M1146 “antibiotic null” host organism (Gomez-Escribano and Bibb, 2011). The heterologous organism S. coelicolor M1446-epn/tmc was cultured in A1 medium and its metabolites were analyzed in parallel with the wild-type BRA-346 and the host organism Streptomyces coelicolor M1446 (Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure S12). M1146-epn/tmc reaches the stationary phase in less than 3 days, with full production of the epoxyketone peptides on day 3, accelerating laboratory cultivation and chemical sample preparation.

The high yields obtained for both final products (2 and 4) in the heterologous organism containing the BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC (M1146-epn/tmc, Figure 5; Supplementary Figure S13) are worth noticing, confirming that the epn/tmc BGC of BRA-346 is a multifunctional BGC capable of producing both TMC-86A and EPN. It was further possible to detect several [M + H]+ MS/MS clusters related to epoxyketone peptides (grouped in Figure 5A), suggesting a collection of epoxyketone peptides that can be formed from BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC expression. In comparison to the wild-type BRA-346, the heterologous organism M1146-epn/tmc showed higher amounts of the biosynthetic final products 2 and 4 and lower amounts of the dihydro leucine intermediates 1 and 3 (Figure 5; Supplementary Figure S13). Although wild-type BRA-346 was reported to produce 2 (Furtado et al., 2021) it did not produce this compound in our experiments (Figure 3A; Supplementary Figures S6, S7), and produced 4 in low yields (Supplementary Figure S8), even when induced by ampicillin (Figure 3C). Together, these results may point to regulation of the last step of 2 and 4 biosynthesis in wild type BRA-346, which was overcome by heterologous expression of the epn/tmc BGC in S. coelicolor M1146. Wild type BRA-346 also presented the production of other antibiotics, what in turn can limit the production of epoxyketone peptides by this highly diverse antibiotic producer (Figure 5A in pink). On the other hand, heterologous expression of the epn/tmc BGC in an “antibiotic null” strain resulted in epoxyketone peptide biosynthetic final products overproduction. This suggests that the availability of biosynthetic precursors and/or crosstalk of regulatory mechanisms are controlling epoxyketone peptide production by wild type BRA-346. Phylogenetic Analyses of the epn/tmc BGC From BRA-346 Aiming to gain further insights on the occurrence and phylogenetic relationship of the BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC we additionally searched for related BGCs in public databases and constructed a phylogenetic tree for this BGC (Figure 6). Aquimarina sp. putative BGC was assigned as the outgroup of the tree, since it was the most distant BGC to BRA346 epn/tmc, while sharing sequence similarities. This analysis showed that the BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC is closely related to other Streptomyces BGCs linked to EPN and TMC specialized metabolites, as expected.

(B) Schematic representation of the 17 BGCs and (C) their related biosynthetic products. BGCs with experimentally validated biosynthetic products are highlighted. ORFs predicted as regulatory proteins are numbered and listed. It is worth noticing that from all the genomes and BGC sequences evaluated (see “Materials and Methods” section for details) only 16 share sequence similarity and minimal BGC characteristics related to BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC. Even within 50 Streptomyces spp. closely related to BRA-346 (vide phylogenetic analysis of Streptomyces sp. BRA-346; Supplementary Figure S15) only two related BGCs could be found. Most of the organisms containing BGCs related to BRA-346 epn/tmc are of the phylum Actinobacteria, covering two orders: Streptomycetales and Pseudonocardiales. Interesting, Coralloccocus sp., and Chondromyces sp., both Proteobacteria in the order Myxococcales, and Aquimarina sp., a Bacteroidetes in the order Flavobacteriales, were also pointed as presenting a BGC related to the BRA-346 epn/tmc (Figure 6). This indicates the occurrence of putative epoxyketone peptide BGCs also in Gram negative bacteria. Together, these results indicated that this BGC is rare in nature, not frequent observed in closely related Streptomyces strains, and not very widespread across Bacteria, being so far restricted to three Phyla (Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, and Proteobacteria). The scarce presence of epn/tmc related BGCs in the BRA-346 species tree (Supplementary Figure S15), in addition to the finding that this BGC was found in unrelated Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria members (Figure 6), point to horizontal gene transfer of this BGC, which is a common feature of Actinobacteria BGCs linked to specialized metabolites (Ziemert et al., 2014). Regarding the environment from which these bacteria or DNA samples were isolated, Streptomyces BRA-346 (marine endemic tunicate Euherdmania sp., Brazil), Streptomyces luteovercillatus CGMCC 15060 (ocean sediment, China) and Aquimarina sp. AU119 (Marine sponge Tedania sp., Australia) were isolated from the marine environment, the others being obtained from soil (most organisms, including eponemycin, TMC-86A, epoxomicin, clarepoxcin, and landepoxcin producers), river sediment (one organism), and decayed wood (one organism) samples. Biosynthetically, the NRPS responsible for the biosynthesis of the peptide core of epoxyketone peptides present up to four condensation domains (C-domains; Supplementary Figure S15). Clades with BGCs sharing C-domain pattern similarity are indicated, as the NRPs encoding the tetrapeptides epoxomicin and clarepoxcin. One clade harbours BGCs with shorter NRPSs, with two C-domains, as Epn/TmcG and the NRPS from BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC, which are responsible for the production of the dipeptides eponemycin and TMC-86A. From these analyses it is possible to suggest that this BGC could suffer module duplication or loss in its evolutionary history. The Epn/TmcG multi-modular enzymes, which add leucine and serine amino acids to a fatty acid precursor in EPN and TMC biosynthesis (Liu et al., 2015; Zabala et al., 2016), share higher sequence identity between Streptomyces BRA-346 Epn/TmcG and S. hygroscopicus EpnG (91% ID) than between BRA-346 Epn/TmcG and S. chromofuscus TmcG (76% ID). In BRA-346, Epn/TmcG might promiscuously accept both longer (EPN) and shorter (TMC) fatty acid precursors, therefore being able to synthesize both specialized metabolites. This potentially indicates an evolutionary path for this enzyme on the flexibility for TMC or EPN biosynthesis, a feature that has been involved in the “evolutionary dynamics of specialized metabolites biosynthesis” (Chevrette et al., 2020). A common characteristic of the retrieved BGCs is the presence of a ACAD enzyme (ORF coloured yellow in Figure 6). The ACAD is related to Epn/TmcF in BRA-346 epn-tmc BGC and is linked to the biosynthesis of the epoxyketone pharmacophore in epoxyketone peptide proteasome inhibitors as EPN (Zettler et al., 2016) and TMC (Zabala et al., 2016). Except for the ACAD from Chondromyces apiculatus (NZ_ASRX01000038), the other ACAD enzymes showed at least 65 sequence similarity (Supplementary Table S8) reflecting a similar biosynthetic role. From the 17 BGCs analyzed, nine also present an ORF encoding for a beta-subunit of the proteasome (related to Epn/TmcC; Figure 6B in cyan). This suggests the presence of a self-resistant gene in these BGCs and, possibly, the biological target for the resulting biosynthetic product (D’Costa et al., 2011; Kale et al., 2011; Ziemert et al., 2016; Alanjary et al., 2017). Indeed, six of the retrieved BGCs have a specialized metabolite assigned, which is proteasome inhibitors: eponemycin, TMC-86A, landepoxcin A, epoxomicin, and clarepoxcin C (Figure 6C). From these, the epoxomicin BGC was the only one that did not show a proteasome beta-subunit within the BGC. Interesting, orphan BGCs from three other Streptomyces species (Streptomyces sp. NBS 14/10, S. bingchenggensis BCW-1, and S. sparsogenes ATCC 25498) and the BGC from Actinocrispum wychmicini DSM 45934 also carry a beta-subunit of the proteasome, showing high level of synteny to the epn/tmc BGCs. The first three orphan BGCs are further clustered with the epoxomicin and clarepoxcin C BGCs in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 6). This indicates that these Actinobacteria BGCs also produce epoxyketone peptides, potentially acting as proteasome inhibitors, thus deserving future research. Regarding BGC regulation, all BGCs retrieved show regulatory genes flanking the BGC, which belong to a diverse set of transcriptional regulators (Figure 6). The three epn/tmc BGCs show regulatory genes upstream the BGC, belonging to the LuxR-type of transcription factors with HTH DNA-binding domains (Epn/TmcA). These DNA binding domains are conserved among the three Epn/TmcA sequences analysed (Supplementary Figure S17). BRA-346 Epn/TmcA is the longer sequence with 190 amino acids, displaying an additional PAS-fold regulatory domain at the N-terminal region of the coded protein. A deep inspection of the epn BGCs also reveals a PAS domain 275–20 bases upstream the epnA ORF. The same analyses could not be performed to the tmc BGC as its sequence is truncated just upstream the tmcA ORF in the public databases consulted. It can be suggested, at least for the BRA-346 epn/tmc BGC, that the PAS domain is an additional sensor for tight regulation of this BGC transcription. The BRA-346 Epn/TmcA PAS domain is predicted to bind at least one ligand, being a heme or flavin ligands (Supplementary Figure S18), which are related to light or redox regulation, respectively. PAS domains can also bind quorum sensing molecules (Pappas et al., 2004), a property that cannot be ruled out to BRA-346 Epn/TmcA at this point. Although little is known about LuxR regulation in Gram-positive bacteria (Santos et al., 2012; Polkade et al., 2016; Rajput and Kumar, 2017), there are precedents in the literature that salinity increases the production of LuxR transcription factor activator molecule, acyl homoserine lactone (AHL), which in turn is produced by LuxI in Gram-negative bacteria (Bjelland et al., 2012; Sivakumar et al., 2019). Phylogenetic analysis of Gram-positive bacteria, however, point that the LuxI/LuxR system is absent in this group, although an analogous signalling molecule, gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), is found in Gram-positive bacteria (Santos et al., 2012; Rajput and Kumar, 2017). Indeed, we could not find a luxI related gene in BRA-346 genome, but we found two butyrolactone BGCs in BRA-346 genome (region 35.1, candidate BGC = 11 kb; and region 2.1, candidate BGC = 11 kb; Supplementary Figure S10). As mentioned above, these GBL BGCs are most certainly related to lipopeptides and macrolactam BGC activation in BRA-346, which in turn shuts-off the production of epoxyketone peptides by this bacterium. It is not clear however if these GBLs, or associated regulatory proteins, have a direct role on the downregulation of the epn/tmc BGC or if its downregulation is simply a consequence of biosynthetic precursor availability, once it competes with the GBL-regulated BRA-346 BGCs for amino and fatty acids. In addition to LuxR transcriptional regulation, the epn/tmcA gene displays three TTA codons, further indicating regulation of this BGC at the translational level. The TTA codon is a rare codon in GC rich genomes, as those of Actinobacteria, which is linked to secondary metabolism regulation (Takano et al., 2003; Sen et al., 2012). Apart from Aquamarina sp. AU119 (33%), the other BGCs analysed here show high GC content (>67%) and TTA regulatory codons were frequently found within the epoxyketone peptide related BGCs, some of them also within the ORF encoding a transcription factor. Considering that Epn/TmcA is a positive regulator of the epn/tmc BGC, the TTA codon on its regulator is also a point of competition during translation. In summary, the analyses of the 16 BGCs related to BRA epn/tmc BGC suggest this BGC is tightly regulated, at both the transcription and translational levels, what can further explain the low reproducibility of wild type BRA-346 cultures in producing epoxyketone peptides.
