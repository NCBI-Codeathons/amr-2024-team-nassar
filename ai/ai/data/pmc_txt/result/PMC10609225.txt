3. Results 3.1. Taxonomy and Biodiversity of Cultivable Actinobacteria A total of 255 actinobacterial strains were isolated from the sediment samples of four saline lakes. These isolates were phylogenetically affiliated to 21 genera, 12 families, and 7 orders based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis (Table S3). Among the 255 isolates, genera Streptomyces (70 isolates) and Kocuria (43 isolates) were numerically dominant, followed by Arthrobacter (27), Citricoccus (24), Dietzia (20), Pseudarthrobacter (10), Nesterenkonia (10), Georgenia (8), Jonesia (8), Cellulomonas (7), Rhodococcus (6), Nocardiopsis (5), Microbacterium (4), Agromyces (3), Paenarthrobacter (2), Pseudoclavibacter (2), and Micromonospora (2), as well as an additional four genera that were represented by only one isolate (Figure 2a). The similarity index of the 16S rRNA gene sequence was obtained from BLAST analysis on the EzBioCloud server [50]. Among all the isolates, 34 strains displayed 100% similarity with the published type strains in the phylum Actinomycetota [64], 181 strains exhibited 99–100% similarity, and 39 strains exhibited 98.65–99% similarity. Only one strain, LD-9, isolated from the Dong Co sediment, exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.4% towards the type strain of Pseudoclavibacter triregionum [65], indicating that LD-9 could represent a novel taxon within the family Microbacteriaceae. A phylogenetic tree based on the analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of 37 type species of Microbacteriaceae (Figure S1) showed that strain LD-9 grouped with the members of the genus Pseudoclavibacter and fell into a coherent subclade with Pseudoclavibacter triregionum, indicating that strain LD-9 should represent a novel species of the genus Pseudoclavibacter. Further polyphasic studies will be performed to determine the taxonomic position of strain LD-9. Cultivable Actinobacteria diversity retrieved from the four saline lakes is illustrated in Figure 2b. The sample from the nameless saline lake yielded the most notable richness and recoverability of actinomycetes, with 127 strains distributed in 17 genera, while the sample from Nieer Co. gave the lowest, with 24 strains distributed in 9 genera. A Venn diagram illustrated the number of genera common and unique distributed in the four saline lake sediments (Figure 2c). Six genera, including Streptomyces, Kocuria, Arthrobacter, Citricoccus, Dietzia, and Georgenia, were recovered from all sampling locations; Genera Cellulomonas and Microbacterium were present in both Nieer Co. and the nameless saline lake; Genus Micromonospora were present in both Dong Co. and Dangqiong Co. Sediment samples from different saline lakes also had exclusive genera. Four unique genera were only retrieved from the nameless saline lake, corresponding to Hoyosella, Brevibacterium, Paenarthrobacter, and Salinibacterium; Genera Flavimobilis and Pseudoclavibacter were only harvested from Dong Co; Genus Agromyces was only harvested from Dangqiong Co. Furthermore, the respective genus abundances were revealed to be considerably different among sampling sites. Streptomyces represented the major genus in both Dangqiong Co. and Dong Co. with 56.3% and 24.2%, respectively. Kocuria was the most abundant genus (22.8%) in the nameless salty lake, while Citricoccus was the most abundant genus (29.1%) in the Nieer Co. To improve the diversity of actinobacteria and mine more rare species, eight isolation media with different carbon and nitrogen sources, salinity levels, and pH values were applied (Table S2). Our results revealed that medium composition had a noticeable impact on the recovery of isolates (Figure 2d). The modified PYG medium (M1, pH 8.0) provided the highest recoverability and diversity, yielding 62 isolates from 16 different genera, while the modified R2A medium (M3, pH 8.0) exhibited the lowest diversity, with only 23 strains from 6 genera. Genera Streptomyces, Kocuria, and Arthrobacter were recovered from all eight media, whereas Flavimobilis was uniquely present in the modified PYG medium (M1, pH 8.0), and Hoyosella and Salinibacterium were isolated only from the alkaline modified PYG medium (M5, pH 10.0). To isolate halotolerant bacteria from saline lakes, three concentrations of NaCl (0%, 3%, and 5%, w/v) were supplemented into the isolation media. We obtained a total of 144 strains from 20 different genera in media without NaCl (M1, M2, M5, and M6), 56 strains from 12 genera in media with 3% NaCl (M3 and M7), and 55 strains from 15 genera in media with 5% NaCl (M4 and M8). Genera such as Streptomyces, Nocardiopsis, Nesterenkonia, and Kocuria, which are known to contain high numbers of halotolerant or halophilic actinobacteria, were mostly found in media with 5% NaCl. 3.2. MATRIX Cultivation and Antibacterial Activity The OSMAC (One Strain Many Compounds) approach is a simple and effective technique to enhance the chemical diversity of microbial metabolites. Traditional methods of microbial biodiscovery involve small-scale liquid cultivations in shake flasks (10–100 mL), which can be cumbersome, time-consuming, and costly when dealing with large numbers of microbial isolates [66]. In this study, we utilized a miniaturized 24-well microbioreactor system called “MATRIX cultivation” [46,47] to facilitate OSMAC fermentation (Figure 3a). This allowed us to cultivate 192 isolates in arrays of 4 different liquid media compositions, yielding 768 crude extracts through in situ solvent extraction on individual MATRIX culture wells. The antimicrobial activity of these extracts was then evaluated by using a turbidometric screening assay monitored in OD600 in 96-well plates, with twelve “ESKAPE” strains used as indicator pathogens. An inhibitory rate above 60% was considered positive for antimicrobial activity. The results showed that out of the 192 tested strains, extracts from 46 strains exhibited antagonistic activity against at least one of the tested pathogens (Table S4). These bioactive strains were affiliated with 13 genera, including Streptomyces (14 strains), Arthrobacter (8), Kocuria (7), Nesterenkonia (4), Dietzia (3), Pseudarthrobacter (2), Nocardiopsis (2), Agromyces (2), Georgenia (1), Cellulomonas (1), Jonesia (1), Micromonospora (1), and Hoyosella (1). The percentage of bioactive strains against different test pathogens is given in Figure 3b. Inhibitory activity was most frequently observed against the drug-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (22 isolates), while bioactive strains against the drug-resistant bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the least frequent (1 isolate). Among the four media (FM1 to FM4, see Table S2) employed in MATRIX cultivation, 23 isolates exhibited antibacterial activity in media FM4, 17 isolates in FM1, 7 isolates in FM2, and 7 isolates in FM3. These results indicated that the FM4 medium was the optimum medium for producing bioactive components. 3.3. Assay of Antibacterial Mechanism Action To distinguish bioactive strains with varying antibacterial mechanisms, MATRIX extracts of the 46 bioactive strains (Table S4) were assayed using a double fluorescent protein reporter (pDualrep2) system. This system has already succeeded in the early identification of antibacterial inhibitors that may block bacterial translation or disrupt DNA replication [67,68,69]. The findings, as shown in Figure 3c, indicate that Streptomyces strains 378 and 549 triggered an SOS response and induced the expression of the TurboRFP. We suggest that these strains can produce compounds that cause DNA damage, similar to levofloxacin. None of the strain extracts could induce the expression of Katushka2S, implying that no extract of the strains could trigger translation stalling on the ribosome and inhibit protein biosynthesis, which is similar to erythromycin. Based on the displayed activity, Streptomyces 378 and 549 have garnered particular interest for scaling up and conducting chemical studies on their bioactive components. 3.4. Scale-up Cultivation and Antimicrobial Activity Revaluation of Strains 378 and 549 BLAST analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences from strains 378 and 549 on the EzBioCloud server revealed that they belonged to the Streptomyces genus. The nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain 378 (GenBank NO. OQ509818, 1397 bp) shared the highest sequence similarity (99.4%) with Streptomyces marokkonensis Ap1T; strain 549 (GenBank NO. OQ509816, 1425 bp) showed the highest identity (99.9%) to Streptomyces sparsus YIM 90018T. In contrast to MATRIX-cultivation, the fermentation broth of the two strains was separately prepared in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask with 100 mL of liquid medium. The antimicrobial activity of the EA extracts was evaluated through the paper-disk diffusion method and presented as inhibition zone diameters against the ESKAPE strains. The antimicrobial activities of the two strains cultivated in 100 mL of liquid medium are presented in Table S5. Strains 378 and 549 exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against all target gram-positive bacteria, and 549 displayed some activity against the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. These results are consistent with the activities previously observed in the MATRIX-cultivation assay. Some differences observed may be due to the different solvents used for extraction and variations in cultural conditions, such as rotation speed and oxygen quantity. 3.5. Chemical Analysis of Crude Extracts from Strains 378 and 549 Modern mass spectrometry methods allow not only the general analysis of secondary metabolites but also the possibility for the identification of individual compounds using information from pre-existing databases [70]. Secondary metabolites present in the crude extracts of strains 378 and 549 were subjected to UPLC-QTOF MS/MS analysis. The acquired UV spectra, molecular formulae, and accurate masses were searched against multiple databases. The identified compounds produced by the two strains are summarized in Table S6. The UPLC-UV-MS/MS chromatogram of strain 378 showed that there were a series of spectrally similar compounds with a characteristic maximum UV absorption at about 497 nm (Figure 4a). These compounds were tentatively identified as anthracycline-type compounds by searching databases and comparing the UV spectral data with the literature references. Out of these compounds, four prominent peaks (1–4) were noted with chromatographic retention times (tR) of 4.13 min, 4.74 min, 7.81 min, and 8.27 min, which presented mass spectra with [M + H]+ ions at mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of 1189.5878, 1173.5925, 772.3516, and 756.3598, respectively. Based on their spectral properties and comparing them to literature data, they were putatively identified as cosmomycin D (1), cosmomycin C (2), cosmomycin B (3), and cosmomycin A (4), respectively. Moreover, the characteristic UV/Vis absorption bands at about 233, 246, 294, 497, and 530 nm for compounds 1–4 were consistent with those of previously reported cosmomycins [71,72]. Their structures were also unambiguously confirmed by comparison of the precursor ion m/z value and fragmentation pattern with reference data [73,74]. For example, the MS2 spectrum of cosmomycin D displayed a positive ion in high abundance at m/z 595.3 [M + 2H]2+ and another in lower abundance at m/z 1189.6, corresponding to the molecular ion [M + H]+. The dissociation products from cosmomycin D were: 1075.5 [–114, corresponding to the loss of the outermost sugar, rhodinose (rho) in one trisaccharide chain]; 945.3 [–130, corresponding to the loss of a middle sugar, 2-deoxy-L-fucose (defuc)]; 831.3 [–114, corresponding to the loss of the outermost sugar (rho) in the second trisaccharide chain]; 701.3 [–130, corresponding to the loss of the middle sugar (defuc) from the second chain]; and 544.3 [–157, corresponding to the loss of the innermost amino sugar, rhodosamine (RhN)]. The dissociation products from 1173.3 for cosmomycin C were 1059.1 (–114) → 945.1 (–114) → 831.2 (–114) → 701.2 (–130) → 544.3 (–157). Cosmomycin C revealed a similar fragmentation pathway with cosmomycin D, except for the first product, 1059.1 (–114), which was in correspondence with the middle sugar in one trisaccharide chain lacking a hydroxyl group. It is worth noting that cosmomycins have been previously reported to possess antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria, show significant antitumor activity against human tumors, and can induce the differentiation of Friend leukemia cells [75,76]. A recent study has also suggested that cosmomycin A inhibits the growth of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 cells with an IC50 value of 2.8 nM [77]. Antibacterial components present in the crude extract of strain 549 were analyzed in the same manner. A series of compounds with similar spectra and molecular weights ranging from 660 to 750 were detected, all exhibiting a distinct UV absorption peak at around 423 nm (Figure 5a). Upon searching in the database, two antibiotics belonging to the angucycline family were annotated: hedamycin at tR 5.17 min (Peak 5, m/z 747.3470 [M + H]+) and kidamycin at tR 6.70 min (Peak 6, m/z 689.3422 [M + H]+). The structures of compounds 5 and 6 were unambiguously verified by comparisons of the specific MS/MS fragmentation pattern (Figure 5c). Hedamycin and kidamycin share similar structures, each containing two amino deoxyhexoses: an anglosamine sugar attached to the C8 and a N,N-dimethylvancosamine attached to the C10 via two unusual C-glycoside bonds. The difference between them lies in the substituent at C2: kidamycin features an olefinic residue, while in hedamycin, the subgroup is substituted with a bisepoxide [78,79]. Hedamycin and kidamycin are known for their broad-spectrum antibacterial activity as well as their insecticidal, anthelmintic, larvicidal, and coccidiostatic properties [80,81,82,83]. 3.6. Molecular Networking Analysis of Streptomyces 378 and 549 To facilitate the dereplication of known compounds and further explore novel aromatic polyketide antibiotics, we employed a molecular networking approach based on MS/MS data acquired from Streptomyces 378 and 549 by using a GNPS-based computational workflow. This approach enabled us to construct a molecular network consisting of 173 nodes that covered a broad range of molecules from m/z 300 to 1200 (Figure 6). Each node within this network represented a molecule, displaying the molecular mass of the parent ion, fragment ion, or different adduct masses. Hence, it was possible to find several nodes corresponding to the same compound. Through elaborate inspection of the resulting molecular network, we were particularly intrigued by three clusters (Clusters A, B, and C) containing precursor masses matching the identified aromatic polyketides. Molecules present in Clusters A and B corresponded to the cosmomycin analogues in strain 378, and molecules present in Cluster C corresponded to the kidamycin analogues in strain 549. In cluster A, a large number of nodes clustered with the previously described molecules cosmomycin C (m/z 1173.5925, [M + H]+) and cosmomycin D (m/z 1189.5878, [M + H]+), indicating the presence of several additional derivatives in strain 378. Analysis of the differences in atomic mass units (amus) relative to the two annotated nods led to the putative identification of five analogs of cosmomycin C or D, including dehydrocosmomycin D (m/z [M + H]+ 1187.5710, C60H87N2O22, compound 7) [84], dehydrocosmomycin C (m/z [M + H]+ 1171.5754, C60H87N2O21, 8) [85], A447 D (m/z [M + H]+ 1171.5754, C60H87N2O21, 9) [86], A447 C (m/z [M + H]+ 1157.5942, C60H89N2O20, 10) [86], and β-rhodomycin S-4 (m/z [M + H]+ 1075.5168, C54H79N2O20, 11) [87]. The annotation of these five molecules was supported by a comparison of mass fragmentation patterns and isotope distributions with those previously reported (Figure S2). Compound 12 (m/z [M + H]+ 1173.5925, C60H89N2O21) possessed an identical molecular mass with cosmomycin C but gave a different fragmentation pattern and retention time in HPLC, indicating that it should be a structural isomer of cosmomycin C. Collisionally-activated dissociation of the precursor ion (1173.6) of compound 12 released fragments at 1059.1(–114) → 929.3(–130) → 815.4(–114) → 685.3(–130) → 528.3(–157). This dissociation pattern is consistent with compound 12 bearing the same sugar residues as cosmomycin D but containing one fewer hydroxyl group in the aglycone. Compound 13 (m/z [M + H]+ 1155.5762, C60H87N2O20) was postulated to contain a double bond in one outermost sugar (rho), as compared to A447 C (10), owing to the disparity in molecular formula (2 Da) and comparable fragmentation pattern. No matches were retrieved from the database for compounds 12 and 13, thereby implying they may represent novel derivatives of cosmomycins. Cluster B, consisting of 6 nodes with precursor masses ranging from m/z 740 to 788 Da, was identified as the family of cosmomycin A (4, m/z 756.3598 [M + H]+) and cosmomycin B (3, m/z 772.3516 [M + H]+). Through propagated annotation of the connected nodes, two additional derivatives were discovered. Compound 14 (m/z [M + H]+ 754.3417, C40H52NO13) with a direct linkage to the node of cosmomycin A was putatively identified as cosmocarcin C [88]. Compound 15 was inferred to be dehydroxylated cosmomycin A with a [M + H]+ ion at m/z 740.3627 that displayed a neutral loss of oxygen (16 Da). Despite a thorough search within the database, no match was found for compound 15, indicating it is possibly a novel compound. However, these potential novel compounds of the cosmomycin family were only detected in trace amounts during the examination of the original chromatogram data of strain 378. In the molecular network of the kidamycin family (Cluster C, depicted in Figure 6d), the protonated molecular ion of kidamycin (6) was found to be clustered with 25 nodes with precursor masses ranging from m/z 642 to 733 Da. Starting with the kidamycin, six additional derivatives of kidamycin were identified, including the 14,16-epoxy analogue of kidamycin (epoxykidamycin, m/z [M + H]+ 705.3298, C39H49N2O10, compound 16) [89], dehydrokidamycin (m/z [M + H]+ 687.3245, C39H47N2O9, 17), saptomycin C1 (m/z [M + H]+ 717.3750, C41H53N2O9, 18) [90], dihydrosaptomycin C1 (m/z [M + H]+ 719.3541, C41H55N2O9, 19) [91], 3”-O-acetylkidamycin (neopluramycin, m/z [M + H]+ 731.3520, C41H51N2O10, 20) [92] and rubiflaoin E (m/z [M + H]+ 733.3668, C41H53N2O10, 21) [93]. UPLC-MS/MS spectra of these putative kidamycin derivatives (16–21) are illustrated in Figure S3. 3.7. Identification of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) for Strains 378 and 549 The draft genome sequences of strains 378 and 549 were analyzed via the bioinformatic tool antiSMASH7.0 to determine their putative biosynthetic capabilities. For stain 378, a total of 30 putative BGCs were detected, including three types of polyketide synthases (T1PKS, T2PKS, and T3PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS), class i-lanthipeptides, butyrolactone, etc. (Table S7). Among the 30 identified BGCs, six clusters were annotated as orphan BGCs for which no homologous gene clusters could be matched, suggesting that they possibly biosynthesize novel natural products or compounds with no characterized BGCs. As for strain 549, there were 20 BGCs predicted, and they were involved in T1PKS, T2PKS, NRPS, class i, iii-lanthipeptides, etc. (Table S8). Five out of 20 identified BGCs belonged to the known clusters encoding for ectoine, AmfS, geosmin, desferrioxamine, and lagmycin with 100% similarity, and two clusters were annotated as orphan BGCs. Notably, both strains 378 and 549 were predicted to harbor a putative T2PKS BGC, which showed high similarity to several known anthracycline-type and angucycline-type BGCs, respectively, consistent with the metabolomic analysis. As outlined above, strain 378 was found to produce cosmomycins that belong to the anthracycline group. AntiSMASH analysis revealed that strain 378 harbors a predicted T2PKS BGC, which exhibits 84% similarity with the cytorhodin BGC from Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666, 97% with cosmomycin D BGC and 92% with cosmomycin B BGC from Streptomyces olindensis, 76% with cosmomycin C BGC from Streptomyces sp. CNT302, 85% with cinerubin B BGC from Streptomyces sp. SPB074, and 91% with rhodomycin BGC from Streptomyces purpurascens (Figure S4). All these compounds share a common tetracyclic benz[b]anthraquinone aglycone belonging to the anthracycline group. The putative T2PKS BGC from strain 378 spans about 72 Kb of contiguous genomic DNA and contains 68 genes. Three genes from locus tag ctg1_80 to ctg1_82 encode the typical minimal PKS composed of ketoacyl synthase (KS), a chain length factor (CLF), and an acyl carrier protein (ACP), which starts with a propionyl-CoA, as well as a gene at ctg1_79 encodes the putative propionyl-CoA: ACP acyltransferase, all of which is responsible for the C-21 backbone formation. In addition, there are three genes at ctg1_92, ctg1_95, and ctg1_105 encoding cyclases, three genes at ctg1_94, ctg1_96, and ctg1_110 encoding ketoreductase, three genes at ctg1_102, ctg1_104, and ctg1_106 encoding methyltransferse, one gene at ctg1_101 encoding monooxygenase, three genes at ctg1_77, ctg1_86, and ctg1_98 encoding glycosyltransferase genes, and a series of genes responsible for the generation of sugar units, all of which are involved in the tailoring process of bioactive metabolites from strain 378. As shown in Figure 7a, 97% of genes from the cosmomycin D BGC show similarity with the genes of the cluster from strain 378 and are in a similar organization, hinting that a great potential exists in the cluster from strain 378 to produce cosmomycin analogues. Strain 549 was found to be capable of producing hedamycin and kidamycin, both of which belong to the angucycline group. AntiSMASH analysis revealed the presence of a T2PKS BGC in strain 549, which exhibited 84% similarity with the hedamycin BGC from Streptomyces griseoruber (Figure S5). However, several divergences in synteny were observed, prompting a further BLAST search in GenBank to identify a more closely related BGC. Fortunately, a kidamycin BGC from Streptomyces sp. strain W2061 was discovered, displaying 97% similarity with the putative BGC from strain 549 and sharing a similar synteny (Figure 7b). This finding suggests that the T2PKS BGC in strain 549 has a high potential for producing kidamycin analogues. Different from the cosmomycin cluster in strain 378, the putative T2PKS BGC in strain 549 is a hybrid of T2PKS and T1PKS and contains 58 genes distributed in about 71 Kb of contiguous genomic DNA. According to the prediction generated by antiSMASH, the T1PKS modules located at the locus tags ctg1_37 and ctg1_38 are in charge of the generation of the starter unit in the T2PKS processing. According to the detailed gene organization, 2-methyl-2-butyryl CoA is deduced to be the most likely starter unit, while hexadienyl CoA is also a possible one, both of which are the starter units of kidamycins and hedamycins. For the T2PKS, the minimal PKS of KS and CLF at ctg1_32 and ctg1_33, respectively, is in charge of the C-23/C-24 backbone formation after 9 rounds of chain extension. In addition, there are two putative genes at ctg1_30 and ctg1_36 encoding cyclases, one gene at ctg1_29 encoding ketoreductase, three genes at ctg1_18, ctg1_43, and ctg1_50 encoding methyltransferse, one gene at ctg1_41 encoding monooxygenase, two genes at ctg1_21 and ctg1_45 encoding glycosyltransferase genes, and a series of genes responsible for the generation of sugar units, all of which are involved in the tailoring process of bioactive metabolites from strain 549. Regarding the other biosynthetic gene clusters that were identified through antiSMASH, we were unable to designate any other secondary metabolites to the anticipated clusters. This could be attributable to most of the BGCs present in strains 378 and 549 being silent, which means the corresponding gene clusters may not have been expressed under the tested conditions. Comprehensive optimization of the culture conditions for these strains can be conducted based on this research in order to delve deeper into their metabolic synthesis potential and discover more types of active natural products.
