RESULTS Interaction of CesAB NRPS with CesC ATPase identified by bacterial two-hybrid screen. In order to identify interactions between Ces NRPS and the ABC transporter, we employed the bacterial adenylate cyclase-based two-hybrid system (BACTH), which is an in vivo genetic approach based on reconstitution of the Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase (Cya) enzyme if proteins of interest interact (32). Ces NRPS, like other enzymes of this class, is a large multimodular protein complex, consisting of CesA (375 kDa) and CesB (300 kDa) subunits (20). Due to the large size of this complex, it is difficult to assess interactions between CesAB and CesCD directly. Consequently, we selected candidate domains within CesAB for BACTH screening (Fig. 1A). We tested all three condensation domains of the complex (the C and C* domains of CesA and the C domain of CesB), as well as one adenylation domain (A2) and the thioesterase domain (TE) of CesB, for potential interactions with CesC. In addition, the C-terminal fragment of CesA, comprising the peptidyl carrier PCP2 and the epimerization (E) and C* domains, was tested for interaction with CesC and CesD. Since CesCD is a putative ABC transporter consisting of ATPase CesC and transmembrane protein CesD (Fig. 1B), we also checked the interaction between these two proteins as a proof of concept. For this purpose, selected ces domains as well as cesC and cesD were subcloned into BACTH vectors pUT18C and pKT25. The new constructs expressed respective CesA/CesB domains, CesC and CesD with N- and C-terminal fusions to the B. pertussis adenylate cyclase domains T18 and T25. Combinations of recombinant plasmids were cotransformed into the Escherichia coli BTH101 reporter strain, deficient in adenylate cyclase gene (cya). When an interaction between the proteins of interest occurs, T18 and T25 are reunited, reconstituting a catalytically functional adenylate cyclase that boosts the production of cAMP in the E. coli
cya-deficient host, resulting in transcription activation of reporter genes under the control of a CAP/cAMP promoter, such as a reporter gene encoding the β-galactosidase. The activity of β-galactosidase can be tested using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG/X-Gal) plates or quantified using the liquid Miller assay (33). An overview of tested proteins and domains is provided in Table S1 in the supplemental material, and results of the BACTH assay are shown in Fig. 1 and 2 and Fig. S1.

As expected, the coexpression of CesC and CesD with N- and C-terminal fusions to the cya fragments T18 and T25, respectively, resulted in the formation of blue colonies on X-Gal/IPTG medium, indicating a positive interaction between CesC and CesD (Fig. 1C). An interaction was also observed between CesC and the second CesA module including PCP2, E, and C* (cesA_PCP2/E/C*) (Fig. 1C) but not between cesD and cesA_PCP2/E/C* (data not shown). Notably, the BACTH assay revealed an interaction between CesC and all C domains from CesA and CesB, while no interaction between CesC and the A2 domain of CesB (CesB_A2) or the TE domain (CesB_TE) was observed (Fig. 1C). Overall, these results indicate a specific interaction between the putative ATPase CesC and the Ces NRPS. To ensure the specificity of the interaction between CesC and Ces NRPS, additional BACTH control assays were performed by using cells coexpressing T18/T25-CesA_PCP2/E/C* with T18/T25 tags fused to MinD from B. subtilis, a protein unrelated to cereulide biosynthesis. MinD, which is a vital part of the B. subtilis division site selection system, is an ATPase that binds reversibly to the cell membrane and recruits the MinC protein, an inhibitor of tubulin-like FtsZ assembly (34). No detectable BACTH signal were observed in BTH101 cells coexpressing T18/T25-CesA_PCP2/E/C* and T18/T25- MinD (Fig. S1). To evaluate the strength of the interaction between two hybrid proteins, β-galactosidase enzymatic activity in bacterial extracts was quantified (Fig. 2). As expected, strong β-galactosidase activity, approximately 20-fold compared to that of the negative control (P < 0.0001), was detected between the subunits CesC and CesD of the putative ABC transporter. Furthermore, the interactions between CesC and the C domains from CesA and CesB resulted in a significant increase in β-galactosidase activity compared to that of the negative controls (P < 0.0001). C-terminal condensation domain of CesA interacts with CesC. In order to verify the interaction between the Ces NRPS (CesAB) and the ATPase CesC observed in the BACTH screen, CesA_C*, suggested previously to play a central role in cereulide assembly (35), was fused to a 6×His tag, while CesC was fused to an S tag. Extracts from E. coli cells overexpressing both fusion proteins (CesA_C* 6×His tag and CesC S tag) were loaded onto an Ni2+ column. After several washing steps followed by elution, the fusion proteins were subsequently detected by multiplex Western blotting, using anti-His tag and anti-S tag antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2, CesA_C*-6×His tag protein pulled down the CesC-S tag protein, indicating interaction between the C* domain of CesA and the ATPase CesC. To exclude unspecific binding of the CesC-S tag protein, extracts from the cells expressing only CesC-S tag were loaded onto the Ni2+ column as a control, which indeed resulted in hardly any detectable protein in the eluate (Fig. 3, control). In summary, the pulldown experiment confirmed specific interaction between the C-terminal condensation domain C* of CesA and CesC in vitro. FIG 3Interactions of CesC and CesA_C* tested by hexahistidine pulldown. CesA_C*-6×His tag pulls down CesC-S tag from E. coli cell lysates on an Ni2+ column. (A) Soluble fractions (S) from E. coli cells expressing fusion proteins as well as the final wash fraction (W) and eluent (E) were tested by multiplex Western blotting using anti-His tag and anti-S tag antibodies.

CesCD is a predicted bacterial ABC transporter consisting of the ATPase CesC and the transmembrane protein CesD (Fig. 1B). Consequently, the interaction partner of CesC is thought to be attached to the cell membrane. In order to test this hypothesis, cesA_C*-mNeon green (mNG) fusion was constructed using double-joint PCR (DJ PCR) (36), cloned into the pDG1664 suicide vector, and integrated into the homoserine kinase gene thrB in B. subtilis 168. cesC was C-terminally labeled with mScarlet (mSc) and, together with unlabeled cesD, cloned into pKAM241 suicide vector and integrated into the alpha-amylase locus amyE of B. subtilis 168. The new strain was designated the Bs_cesC-mSc_cesD/cesA_C*-mNG strain. As a control, strains with cesA_C*-mNG integrated into thrB together with either only cesC-mSc or unlabeled cesD integrated into amyE were constructed. The recombinant control strains were designated the Bs_cesC-mSc/cesA_C*-mNG and Bs_cesD/cesA_C*-mNG strains, respectively. By using a cesP promoter-lux reporter fusion inserted into the B. subtilis 168 amyE locus, we recently showed that the B. cereus
cesP promoter is active in B. subtilis (A. Gacek-Matthews, J. Altenbuchner, and M. Ehling-Schulz, unpublished data). Therefore, all gene fusions were expressed from the native B. cereus
cesP promoter. The full genotypes of the strains are provided in Table 1. Bacterial strains used in this study Strain Genotype or relevant characteristics Source or reference. E. coli.

As revealed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4), coexpression of cesA_C*-mNG with gene fusion cesC-mSc_cesD in the Bs_cesC-mSc_cesD/cesA_C*-mNG strain led to the formation of membrane-localized foci. In contrast, in the recombinant B. subtilis
Bs_cesD/cesA_C*-mNG strain, CesA_C*-mNG was localized in the cytosol. Similarly, when cesA_C*-mNG was coexpressed with cesC-mSc (Bs_cesC-mSc/cesA_C*-mNG), both proteins were detected in the cytosol. There were fewer cells (around 10 from 100 inspected) expressing CesCD_mSc than expressing CesA_C*_mNG, suggesting that CesCD might be toxic for B. subtilis 168. In summary, our in vivo colocalization studies showed that CesCD ropes CesA_C* to the cell membrane, and if either CesC or CesD is lacking, CesA_C* is delocalized and found to be diffuse throughout the cytosol.

Deletion or point mutation of Walker A domain of cesC disrupts the interaction with CesA_C* and blocks cereulide biosynthesis. To investigate whether binding and/or hydrolysis of ATP by CesC is required for the physical contact with CesAB, mutated versions of CesC were constructed and expressed in trans together with CesD in an isogenic CesCD null mutant of the emetic B. cereus reference strain F4810/72. As the conserved Walker A motif is known to play a central role in ABC transporters (11), we deleted a 33-amino-acid (aa) region surrounding the conserved Walker A motif in CesC and changed conserved lysine (K) 40 within Walker A (GPNGAGKST) to methionine (K40M) (Fig. 5B). In addition, we exchanged V29T and F30Y, which are located outside Walker A but within the 33-amino-acid region deleted in strain F48ΔcesCDcesCDΔWalkerA. All mutated versions of cesC were cloned in a pAD123 plasmid, transformed into B. cereus strain F48ΔcesCD, and expressed from the native cesP promoter. An overview of the constructed strains is given in Table 1. The new strains, designated F48ΔcesCDcesCDΔWalkerA, F48ΔcesCDcesCD_K40M, and F48ΔcesCDcesCD_V29T/F30Y, were tested for their cereulide production capacities as described previously (30). The strains F48ΔcesCDcesCD and F48ΔcesCD served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Similar to the case with F48ΔcesCD, the deletion of the 33-aa region spanning Walker A and the exchange of K40M eliminated cereulide production, while the double exchange of V29T and F30Y reduced the cereulide production to approximately 40% of that of the reference strain F48ΔcesCDcesCD (Fig. 5A). In sum, these results suggest a novel type of ABC transporter-NRPS biosynthetic machinery.

To gain further insights into the proposed ABC transporter-NRPS biosynthetic machinery, we tested the constructs from strains F48ΔcesCDcesCDΔWalkerA, F48ΔcesCDcesCD_K40M, and F48ΔcesCDcesCD_V29T/F30Y in the BACTH screening assay, using CesA_C* and CesD as an interacting partner (Fig. 5C and D). The positive protein-protein interaction between CesC and CesD as well as between CesC and CesA_C* described above (see also Fig. 1) served as controls. In addition, the effect of the mutation in CesC on homodimer formation was tested. The deletion of the 33-aa region including the Walker A motif in CesC aborted the interaction of CesC with both CesA_C* and CesD (Fig. 5C), and exchange of the conserved K40M within Walker A led to significant decrease in β-galactosidase activity of BTH101 cells coexpressing CesCK40M with CesA_C* (approximately 30%; P < 0.05) and CesD (approximately 70%; P < 0.01) (Fig. 5D). In contrast, the two point mutations V29T and F30Y in CesC outside Walker A did not significantly impact the interactions between CesC and CesA_C* or between CesC and CesD. Interestingly, deletion of the 33-amino-acid region surrounding Walker A not only led to the loss of the interaction with CesA_C* but also disrupted the CesCΔWalkerA-CesCΔWalkerA homodimer (Fig. 5C and D). Similarly, the exchange of the conserved amino acids K40M and V29T/F30Y showed approximately 40% reduction of β-galactosidase activity in the self-interaction BACTH assay (Fig. 5D). These results emphasize that the interaction between CesC and CesAB as well as the formation of a functional CesCD complex is essential for efficient cereulide biosynthesis. Bacillus thuringiensis ABC transporter BerAB interacts with B. cereus Ces NRPS and enables cereulide biosynthesis. An in silico search using BLASTP revealed that the ABC transporter BerAB of B. thuringiensis is the protein most similar to CesCD, with 47.69% amino acid identity and 73.68% similarity between the ATPases CesC and BerA (coding sequence [CDS]: AFV19354.1) as well as 32.08% amino acid identity and 74.62% similarity between the membrane proteins CesD and BerB (CDS: AFV19353.1), respectively. Thus, we employed the I-TASSER platform for protein structure prediction (37) to acquire models for CesC, CesD, BerA, and BerB. As depicted in Fig. 6A and B, the theoretical models for the transmembrane proteins CesD and BerB nearly perfectly match and the models of ATPases CesC and BerA also display high similarities.

Each experiment was performed three times independently. Error bars depict standard deviations from the mean value. To examine whether the role of the ABC transporter in cereulide biosynthesis described here is unique to cesCD or whether it is potentially a widespread mechanism, we amplified berAB from B. thuringiensis 407, fused it to a xylose-inducible promoter in the expression vector pWH1520, and introduced the constructs into the F4810/72 ΔcesCD strain. Induction of berAB with 0.1% xylose in the new strain, designated F48ΔcesCDberAB, resulted in cereulide production levels comparable to those of the wild type (Fig. 6C). These data clearly demonstrated that the structurally related transporter BerAB complements CesCD function in cereulide biosynthesis, even though B. thuringiensis is not a cereulide producer. Since BerAB restored cereulide production in F48ΔcesCD to the wild-type (WT) level, it could be assumed that there is also physical contact between CesNRPS CerAB and the ATPase BerA. To test this hypothesis, berA and berB were cloned into BACTH vectors and interaction studies were carried out as described above. As expected, BerA and BerB showed a very strong interaction (see Fig. 6D and E). However, there were also strong interactions between the ATPase BerA from B. thuringiensis and the membrane protein CesD from B. cereus as well as between the ATPase CesC from B. cereus and the membrane protein BerB from B. thuringiensis. These data indicate that BerAB is similar to CesCD not only in terms of structure but also in terms of function. These findings were corroborated by the results from the BACTH studies of BerA and the condensation domains of the cereulide synthetase CesAB. A positive interaction between BerA and CesA_C* was observed, while no interaction was found for BerA and CesB_A2 (Fig. 6D and E). These results, which are in line with the ones from our interaction studies of CesAB and CesC (see Fig. 1), demonstrated that the described function of the ABC transporter CesCD in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis could indeed be a widespread mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we used the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) repository (38) to search for CesC-homologous ATPases associated with NRPS gene clusters. As shown in Table S4, this search revealed several putative ATPases adjected to NRPS gene clusters, showing between 46% and 32% identity to CesC. With our work we showed that not only CesCD, encoded within the cereulide operon, provides an essential function in cereulide biosynthesis but also that the structurally similar transporter B. thuringiensis BerAB, nota bene not located within any NRPS biosynthetic locus, could functionally complement CesCD by creating a biosynthetic complex with the CesAB cereulide synthetase.
