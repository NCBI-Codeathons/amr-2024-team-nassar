RESULTS Extracellular DNA protects HeLa cells from the genotoxicity of pks+
E. coli and exhibits interstrand cross-links. It was recently proposed that an isolated candidate nongenotoxic precolibactin, or synthetic compounds analogous to predicted colibactins, could alkylate DNA (32, 33). We reasoned that if natural active colibactins produced by pks+
E. coli can alkylate and hence bind DNA, addition of extracellular DNA during the infection of mammalian cells should capture colibactins and thus inhibit their genotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, HeLa cells were infected for 4 h with laboratory E. coli strain DH10B hosting a bacterial artificial chromosome bearing the pks island (pBACpks), in the presence or absence of linear double-strand bacterial plasmid or calf thymus DNA in the culture medium. HeLa cell DNA damage was then quantified by examining the phosphorylation of histone H2AX on S139 (p-H2AX), a sensitive and quantitative reporter of DNA damage (34) (Fig. 1a). The addition of 500 ng of either calf thymus DNA or linearized plasmid DNA in the interaction medium readily reduced the p-H2AX levels in HeLa cells exposed to the genotoxic pks+
E. coli. Increasing the amount of extracellular DNA further decreased the p-H2AX response (Fig. 1b and c). These results suggest that the extracellular double-strand DNA captured the genotoxin, resulting in reduced DNA damage in HeLa cells exposed to colibactin-producing E. coli.

We next examined whether the extracellular DNA exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria exhibited damage. The plasmid or calf thymus DNA was isolated from the infection coculture medium and analyzed by native or denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA did not show detectable cleaved DNA on nondenaturing gels (Fig. 1d). In contrast, following electrophoresis under alkaline denaturing conditions (thus allowing the migration of DNA in single-strand form), the DNA from the coculture composed of the pks+
E. coli and the HeLa cells exhibited DNA fragments with a marked decrease in their electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1e). Calf thymus DNA fragments with an apparent molecular weight of more than 5 kb were detected in the DH10B pBACpks coculture, whereas DNA from the control uninfected culture or from the DH10B vector coculture remained at similar levels below 3.5 kb (Fig. 1e; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The plasmid DNA isolated from the pks+
E. coli HeLa cell coculture exhibited a supplementary band with a 2-fold apparent molecular weight increase (Fig. 1e; see also Fig. S1), suggesting that the DNA strands did not separate during electrophoresis despite the denaturing conditions. The DH10B vector strain did not induce this doubling in apparent molecular weight on the denaturing gels. DNA signal intensities (gray values) of the electrophoretic gels shown in Fig. 1. The images were analyzed using NIH ImageJ. The background was subtracted with a rolling-ball radius of 100 pixels (px), each lane was selected with a pasted rectangular selection, and the corresponding plot profile (shortcut ALT-K) was determined. The migration distances were calibrated in apparent molecular weight values, based on the molecular weight marker profile, using VisualSpec software. On the lower left panel, the highest molecular weight (bases) of the DNA signal detected above 5 times that of the average background signal is shown. On the lower right panel, the apparent molecular weights of the bands, as determined by the center of the Gaussian fit, are shown. Download FIG S1, TIF file, 0.7 MB. Plasmid DNA exposed for 4 h to live pks+
E. coli without the eukaryotic cells also exhibited DNA fragments that had shifted to a 2-fold apparent molecular weight increase on denaturing gels (Fig. 2a). When the DNA was exposed to pks+
E. coli with increased incubation times or with increased numbers of bacteria, the proportion of the shifted band increased while that of the unmodified lower DNA band diminished (Fig. 2b and c). In contrast, the DNA exposed to control E. coli hosting the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector under identical conditions did not show such an electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 2b and c). The DNA shift induced by exposure to pks+
E. coli was similar to that induced by treatment with the DNA cross-linking drug cisplatin, whereas the monofunctional alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) did not induce a detectable band shift (Fig. 2a). These results strongly suggest that exposure to pks+
E. coli bacteria generated DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). FIG 2 Nondenaturable interstrand cross-links in DNA exposed to pks+

(a) Linearized plasmid double-strand DNA (400 ng) was incubated for 4 h with DH10B pBACpks or vector (inoculum of 3 × 106 bacteria in 100 μl) or treated for 4 h with 80 μM cisplatin or 5 mM methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and then analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis.

To confirm the occurrence of ICLs in the extracellular DNA exposed to pks+
E. coli, we used an ethidium fluorescence assay to examine the recovery of fluorescence following denaturation and rapid cooling. In this assay, separate DNA strands do not reanneal, whereas ICL-connected strands renature rapidly, as ICLs serve as a nucleation points for rapid renaturation (35) (Fig. 2d). The DNA exposed to the E. coli vector or to MMS, which does not induce ICL, showed a modest renaturation similar to the results seen the control untreated DNA (Fig. 2e). In contrast, DNA exposed to pks+
E. coli exhibited marked renaturation, similar to that in cisplatin-treated DNA (Fig. 2e). Taken together, the results from the alkaline electrophoresis and renaturation assay demonstrated that exposure of DNA to pks+

E. coli. Direct contact of live pks+
E. coli cells producing colibactins with eukaryotic cells is required to observe nuclear DNA damage (1, 36). Similarly, the extracellular DNA cross-linking activity of pks+
E. coli required a close interaction with live bacteria; no ICLs were observed in the DNA treated with bacterial culture supernatants or in the DNA separated from the DH10B pBACpks bacteria by a membrane with 0.2-μm pores (Fig. S2). The genotoxicity and interstrand cross-linking phenotypes were fully correlated in different pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae strains harboring the pks island; clinical strains of E. coli, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes induced both p-H2AX in infected HeLa cells and ICL in extracellular DNA (Fig. S3). To further establish the role of colibactins in the induction of extracellular DNA ICL, we assessed isogenic mutants of pks island genes that impair various steps of the colibactin synthesis pathway. Mutation of the clbA gene encoding the phosphopantetheinyl transferase that activates the NRPS and PKS enzymes resulted in a complete loss of extracellular DNA interstrand cross-linking activity and genotoxicity in infected HeLa cells (Fig. 3a). A clbH mutant impaired for the NRPS that incorporates the electrophile cyclopropane in colibactin (32, 37) also exhibited a complete loss of both phenotypes (Fig. 3a). Mutation of clbQ encoding the thioesterase that off-loads synthesis intermediates from the NRPS-PKS enzymatic assembly line abrogated both phenotypes (Fig. 3a). Finally, a clbP mutant defective for the peptidase that deacetylates precolibactins to generate the mature active colibactins completely lost the cross-linking activity and genotoxicity for HeLa cells (Fig. 3a). Both the genotoxicity and cross-linking phenotypes were fully restored by complementation of all mutants with their cognate wild-type clb genes (Fig. 3a). Thus, an intact colibactin synthesis pathway is required for the DNA cross-linking activity. DNA interstrand cross-links are generated in a contact-mediated manner by pks+ bacteria. Linearized double-stranded plasmid DNA was exposed to DH10B pBACpks bacteria, to the bacterial culture supernatant, or to the live bacteria placed in an insertion separated from the DNA by a permeable membrane with 0.2-μm pores. Following exposure, the DNA was collected and analyzed by denaturing electrophoresis. Download FIG S2, TIF file, 0.5 MB.

Genotoxic index values (p-H2AX signal relative to DNA content, normalized to control cells) are shown in panel d. The histogram bars represent means of results from a duplicate experiment. To accumulate additional evidence to establish the role of colibactins in the induction of DNA ICL, we tested whether the colibactin resistance protein could protect DNA from the genotoxin. Indeed, colibactin-producing bacteria protect themselves from their own mature active genotoxin by producing the ClbS hydrolase, which inactivates colibactins (26, 27). We thus reasoned that adding the purified ClbS protein into the supernatant should inhibit colibactin-induced DNA ICL. DNA was exposed to E. coli DH10B pBACpks or to the E. coli SP15, C. koseri, and K. pneumoniae clinical isolates in the presence or absence of 400 nM purified His-tagged ClbS protein. The DNA did not exhibit ICL (or the levels were barely detectable), indicating that it was readily protected by ClbS (Fig. 3b; see also Fig. S4). In contrast, the heat-denatured ClbS protein did not protect the DNA exposed to the pks+ bacteria (Fig. 3b; see also Fig. S4). ClbS did not inhibit DNA cross-linking by cisplatin, confirming its specificity for colibactins (Fig. S4). HeLa cells infected with DH10B pBACpks in the presence of purified ClbS exhibited markedly reduced levels of p-H2AX compared to cells infected in the presence of heat-denatured ClbS or without ClbS (Fig. 3c and d), confirming that ClbS inhibits the genotoxin activity. Taken together, the results from these genetic analyses and protection assays show that the natural mature colibactins produced by pks+

Download FIG S4, TIF file, 0.4 MB. Infection of HeLa cells with colibactin-producing E. coli induces an ATR-dependent replication stress response. We next asked whether colibactins could induce DNA ICL in human cells. We previously showed that colibactin-dependent genomic injuries induce the host DNA damage response through increases of levels of p-H2AX and activation of ATM by phosphorylation on S1981 (1). ATM activation depends on the presence of DSBs, which are DNA lesions that can be generated during replication-dependent ICL repair (38). Before DSB formation, ICLs first block progression of replication forks (by preventing replicative helicase-dependent double-strand DNA unwinding), resulting in the activation of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) by autophosphorylation at T1989. Activated ATR then coordinates the cellular response to the replication stress and ICL removal (39). We thus monitored ATR and ATM activation in HeLa cells collected 8 h after infection with DH10B hosting the BACpks or the vector or after treatment with mitomycin C (MMC). Western blot analyses showed that both ATM and ATR were phosphorylated following infection with pks+
E. coli or after MMC treatment (Fig. 4a; see also Fig. S5). This indicated that, similarly to the results seen with MMC, infection with colibactin-producing bacteria induces the formation of replication stress-mediated DSBs. Quantification of the results of the Western blot experiments presented in Fig. 4. The relative densities of the bands for p-ATM, p-ATR, p-Chk1, and p-RPA relative to actin or Chk1 or RPA were measured using NIH ImageJ.

E. coli, we next examined two targets of the ATR kinase activity, Chk1 and replication protein A-32 (RPA), for phosphorylation at S345 and S33, respectively (40, 41). As seen with cisplatin, but in contrast to the results seen with bacteria hosting the vector, infection with DH10B pBACpks induced the phosphorylation of Chk1 and RPA. Inactivating ATR by the use of its specific inhibitor VE-821 (ATRi) (41) prevented this response (Fig. 4b; see also Fig. S5). We observed a loss of histone H3 phosphorylation (a hallmark of chromosome condensation) and of mitotic cells (Fig. S6) following infection with DH10B pBACpks that was consistent with cell cycle arrest (1). Treatment with ATRi alleviated this response, allowing pks+
E. coli-infected cells to enter mitosis with damaged DNA, evidenced by p-H2AX staining (Fig. S6). These mitotic cells never reached anaphase, strongly suggesting the presence of a chromosome segregation defect that ultimately leads to cell death by mitotic catastrophe (42). Hence, ATRi impaired cell viability upon treatment with cisplatin or infection with pks+ bacteria but not infection with bacteria lacking pks (Fig. 4c). Together, these results showed that infection of human cells with colibactin-producing bacteria elicits an ATR-dependent replication stress response, similar to that promoted by ICL-inducing agents, resulting in cell cycle arrest to prevent mitosis entry with damaged chromosomes and, ultimately, mitotic catastrophe. Inhibition of ATR allows mitosis reentry and catastrophe in HeLa cells infected with pks+

HeLa cells infected with colibactin-producing E. coli exhibit recruitment of the Fanconi anemia repair pathway. In mammalian cells, the Fanconi anemia pathway is central to the repair of DNA ICL. Upon blockage of replication fork progression by DNA ICLs, Fanconi anemia protein D2 (FANCD2) is activated by monoubiquitinylation and is recruited to stalled forks, where it colocalizes in subnuclear foci with p-H2AX and orchestrates ICL removal (43–46). We thus examined whether HeLa cells infected with pks+
E. coli recapitulated these responses. As visualized by Western blotting, DH10B pBACpks-infected and MMC-treated cells exhibited the heaviest form of FANCD2 corresponding to the monoubiquitinylated protein, whereas DH10B pBAC vector-infected cells exhibited mostly the unmodified form of FANCD2 (Fig. 5a). Next, FANCD2 and p-H2AX focus formation was examined by fluorescence microscopy in HeLa cells infected with DH10B pBACpks or vector or treated with MMC. Four hours after exposure to DH10B vector, the cells presented some detectable p-H2AX and FANCD2 foci, reflecting the S-phase cells, as some FANCD2 foci form spontaneously during unperturbed replication (45) (Fig. 5b). In contrast, cells infected with DH10B pBACpks exhibited distinctive nuclear foci of FANCD2 colocalized with p-H2AX, similarly to the results observed in MMC-treated cells (Fig. 5b; see also Fig. S7). The percentage of cells harboring p-H2AX and FANCD2 foci increased markedly between 4 and 20 h after infection with DH10B pBACpks or treatment with MMC (Fig. 5c; see also Fig. S7). These comparable time-dependent responses strongly suggest that, similarly to the results seen with MMC-induced replication stress, DH10B pBACpks-infected cells entering the S phase encountered ICLs that activated the Fanconi pathway. We confirmed these observations by assessing the recruitment to DH10B pBACpks-induced repair foci of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and RPA, two well-established markers of DNA DSBs and blocked replication forks, respectively. In the same way as was seen with p-H2AX/FANCD2 foci, 53BP1 and RPA colocalized in subnuclear foci in a time-dependent manner in MMC-treated or pks+

The recruitment of FANCD2 upon infection with pks+
E. coli argues for a role of the Fanconi anemia pathway in the management of ICLs induced by colibactin. Thus, we next asked whether inhibition of ICL repair results in hypersensitivity of the cells to colibactin. To test this hypothesis, FANCD2 expression was knocked down in HeLa cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Fig. S10a), the cells were infected with DH10 pBACpks or vector, and cell survival was assessed in a clonogenic assay. FANCD2-depleted cells formed significantly fewer colonies than HeLa cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA 7 days after infection with DH10B pBACpks but not after infection with DH10B pBAC vector (Fig. 5d; see also Fig. S10b). Thus, loss of ICL repair sensitizes HeLa cells to colibactin-producing E. coli. Together, these data demonstrate that in human cells, the Fanconi pathway machinery that is central to ICL repair is recruited following colibactin-induced DNA damage and is required for survival of infection with colibactin-producing bacteria. Knockdown of FANCD2 and HeLa cell clonogeny following infection with pks+
E. coli. (a) HeLa cells were transfected with scramble (control) or FANCD2 siRNA, and soluble cell extracts were prepared to assess FANCD2 protein levels by Western blotting. Lamin A is shown as a loading control. (b) HeLa cells were transfected with scrambled or FANCD2 siRNAs and then infected with E. coli DH10B hosting the BAC pks or vector (MOI = 12). Following a 4-h infection, the cells were washed and subjected to trypsinization, and 300 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and grown for 7 days. This assay measures the ability of individual cells to divide and form new colonies, allowing precise assessment of cell survival. The colonies formed by surviving cells were stained and photographed. Colonies containing at least 50 cells were counted. Clonogenic cell survival was corrected for plating efficiency by normalizing with the number of colonies formed by control cells. Download FIG S10, TIF file, 1.1 MB. Colibactin generates DNA interstrand cross-links in cellulo. To examine directly the occurrence of DNA ICLs in human cells exposed to pks+ enterobacteria, we inspected the cell genomic DNA by denaturing gel electrophoresis. HeLa cells were infected for 4 h with DH10B hosting pBACpks or with empty vector. As controls, cells were treated for 4 h with MMS, MMC, or cisplatin. HeLa cell genomic DNA was extracted immediately at the end of the infection period and analyzed on denaturing agarose gels (Fig. 6a). As expected, the genomic DNA of untreated cells migrated in the electrophoretic gel as an intact band with a high apparent molecular weight. In contrast, because ICLs prevent the denaturation of DNA and therefore inhibit its electrophoretic migration (47), a significant fraction of the genomic DNA of the cells treated with an ICL-inducing agent (cisplatin or MMC), but not of those treated with the monofunctional alkylating agent MMS, did not enter the gel and remained in the loading well (Fig. 6a and b). Similarly, the genomic DNA of cells infected with DH10B pBACpks exhibited a significant fraction of cross-linked DNA that did not migrate (Fig. 6a and b). This result indicated that DNA cross-links are rapidly generated by colibactin in infected HeLa cells. The addition of purified ClbS protein during the infection reduced the fraction of nonmigrating DNA in cells infected with pks+ bacteria to background levels but not in cisplatin-treated cells, thus confirming the involvement of the natural mature colibactin (Fig. 6c and d). Together with the replication stress and recruitment of the Fanconi anemia ICL repair pathway in pks-infected cells, these results demonstrate that the natural colibactin genotoxin generates DNA ICL in infected human cells.
