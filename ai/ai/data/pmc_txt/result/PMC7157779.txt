RESULTS Geobacter spp. increasingly dominate coculture populations through adaptation. Previously, we observed that Geobacter spp. became more metabolically flexible with coculture adaptation. We also found that the abundance of Geobacter proteins was greater than that of Pseudomonas proteins in extracted coculture proteomes (39). To determine whether the increase in Geobacter metabolic flexibility changed coculture population dynamics over time, we directly quantified the abundance of each microbe in the population by performing qPCR on all cocultures (PAO1 + DL-1, PA14 + DL-1, and phz mutant + DL-1) for both initial (subculture 0 [s0]) and adapted (subculture 13 [s13]) cocultures. In both the initial and adapted cocultures, the Geobacter copy number significantly outnumbered that of Pseudomonas spp. (Fig. 1). FIG 1Proportion of G. sulfurreducens to P. aeruginosa in cocultures. Black and gray bars represent log copy numbers of DNA from early-stationary-phase cocultures using G. sulfurreducens-specific primers (Gsulf_F and Gsulf_R) and Pseudomonas-specific primers (Pse435F and Pse686R), respectively, via qPCR.

Solid bars represent initial (s0) cocultures, and dotted bars represent adapted (s13) cocultures. *, P ≤ 0.05. The dominance of G. sulfurreducens became more pronounced with adaptive evolution over 100 generations by s13, with the highest proportion of Geobacter to Pseudomonas spp. found in the adapted phz mutant + DL-1 cocultures (Table 1). This result shows that Geobacter spp. may be more likely to dominate Pseudomonas spp. in the absence of phenazine secretion and suggests a possible inhibitory role of phenazines on Geobacter spp. (see below). Overall bacterial abundance increased through successive coculture generations (Fig. S1), and Geobacter spp. became the most abundant community members by S13. This corresponds with its enhanced metabolic flexibility as it adapts (39), and hence its diminished reliance on Pseudomonas spp. for providing electron donors through DIET.

Due to the inability of qPCR to distinguish viable from nonviable cells (42), FISH was performed using probes (Table S1) targeting 16S rRNA, visualizing only the metabolically active population (43). FISH confirmed the dominant presence of Geobacter spp. (Fig. 2) in both the initial and adapted cocultures (Fig. S2 to S5). However, the Pseudomonas population as visualized by FISH was lower than that found by qPCR, and therefore, the majority of the Pseudomonas population identified by qPCR is likely to represent a subpopulation of either slow-growing/dormant cells, metabolically inactive cells, or extracellular DNA (44). Intriguingly, despite the larger population of Geobacter spp. and their increased metabolic flexibility over time, isolation of G. sulfurreducens from the cocultures where it was plated on Nutrient broth supplemented with acetate and fumarate (NBAF) agar under anaerobic conditions (see the Supplemental Methods) was not successful. Conversely, P. aeruginosa was easily isolated from the cocultures on LB agar under aerobic conditions (Fig. S6 and S7).

Genetic selection of tetR and fabI variants in early and late stages of coculture evolution. Whole-genome sequencing of all cocultures and the original inoculum pure cultures was conducted to detect whether any mutations were selected for in the initial (s0) and adapted (s13) cocultures. Given the significantly lower abundance of P. aeruginosa in all cocultures, the genomic reads corresponding to P. aeruginosa were insufficient for statistically significant data analysis and variant calling. A comparison of the cocultures to the original inoculate of G. sulfurreducens revealed the presence of two genetic variants gained through coculture adaptation, a frameshift insertion in the tetR gene (GSU0951) and a missense single-nucleotide variant in the fabI gene (GSU1008), that were absent from the inoculate DL-1 genome (Fig. 3). FIG 3Genetic variants found in G. sulfurreducens from cocultures with P. aeruginosa initial (s0) and adapted (s13) via whole-genome sequencing.

Three biological replicates per coculture were sequenced. The left column represents DL-1 pure culture in NBAF, and reads were aligned against the assembly of the Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA genome (NCBI assembly no. GCF_000007985.2). The fabI missense single-nucleotide variant was rapidly selected for early in coculture adaptation, possibly during lag phase, where an average of 83% of the reads across replicates from initially established cocultures had already acquired it (Fig. 3). Further selection occurred with evolution, whereby an average of 99% of the reads across replicates contained this mutation by the 13th transfer. This variant is characterized by a single nucleic acid substitution at genetic coordinate 1089002, resulting in a missense mutation that substitutes a serine for a proline at amino acid position 122. This gene encodes FabI, an enoyl-acyl-carrier protein (enoyl-ACP) reductase which catalyzes the last step in fatty acid biosynthesis (45, 46). FabI is a target for several antibiotics, including diazaborine (47), isoniazid (48), and triclosan (49), and a single amino acid substitution within it is sufficient to confer resistance to these antibiotics (48, 50–54). Early selection was also observed for a genomic variant of the GSU0951 (here referred to as tetR) gene, which was found in an average of 22% of the initial coculture reads across replicates. Similar to the fabI variant, the tetR variant was strongly selected for through coculture adaptation, becoming present in an average of 98% of the adapted coculture reads. This variant was characterized by a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) involving an insertion at genetic locus 1023986. This SNP resulted in a frameshift mutation, changing the identities of 43 amino acids downstream of this position, followed by an early stop codon, leading to premature truncation of the protein. The absence of this protein from all coculture proteomes suggests that this mutation is likely deleterious. Although G. sulfurreducens pure cultures grown in syntrophic NB(formate + fumarate) medium were not evolved through serial transfers due to their poor growth in this medium, we recently observed that adaptively evolved PilA-deficient mutants of G. sulfurreducens (via 13 serial transfers) in NB(formate + fumarate) medium do not acquire any mutations in tetR or fabI (55). Therefore, these two mutations appear to be specifically acquired in response to the presence of P. aeruginosa. Evidence for TetR regulation of CyaE and an RND efflux pump. tetR encodes a predicted transcriptional regulator of the TetR family, the members of which are known to behave as repressors of transcriptional activity (40). TetR is situated upstream of a predicted operon composed of genes GSU0950 and GSU0949, which putatively encode an outer membrane adenylate cyclase transporter (CyaE) and an RND efflux pump, respectively, and predicted ABC transporter genes, GSU0948 and GSU0947 (40). As TetR is predicted to negatively regulate this operon, we looked at the protein abundances of these gene products within our proteomics data previously obtained by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) (39). Both GSU0950 (herein referred to as CyaE) and GSU0949 (RND family efflux pump) were found in significantly higher abundances in cocultures than in G. sulfurreducens pure cultures. As the genetic frequency of the tetR variants increased from 22% (range, 17 to 31%) to 98% (range, 95 to 100%) with adaptive evolution, the log2 fold change (log2FC) (coculture versus DL-1) of CyaE protein abundance increased from an average of 1.4 (range, 1.31 to 1.62) to 2.7 (range, 2.71 to 2.76) (Fig. 4). Similarly, GSU0949 increased in abundance, with adaptation from initially absent to a log2FC of 2.46 (range, 2.30 to 2.75). Interestingly, GSU0948 and GSU0947 were not found in the extracted proteomes, suggesting a lack of control of these genes by TetR under the conditions of this study.

Genes depicted by green arrows represent those absent from the proteomes. Antimicrobial activity of PHZ-1-CA does not select for tetR and fabI genetic variants. Due to the ability of RND efflux pumps to export antibiotics like Pseudomonas phenazines (56) and our finding that Geobacter dominance over Pseudomonas spp. was highest in the absence of phenazines, we sought to test the antimicrobial activity of phenazines on G. sulfurreducens. We measured the MIC of PHZ-1-CA, a precursor to PYO, phenazine-1-carboxamide, and 1-hydroxyphenazine (57), for G. sulfurreducens in adapted cocultures versus that of the G. sulfurreducens DL-1 wild type (not previously exposed to P. aeruginosa). The MIC of cocultures with PAO1 and PA14 was 250 mg/liter (Table 2), whereas the MIC of phz mutant cocultures was 125 mg/liter after 38 days. The MIC of the DL-1 wild type was 125 mg/liter, the same as for the phz mutant coculture, and after one serial transfer (s1), it increased to 250 mg/liter. This result confirms a partial inhibitory activity of PHZ-1-CA on G. sulfurreducens and suggests that the various phenazine derivatives may be secreted by the PAO1 + DL-1 and PA14 + DL-1 cocultures given their higher MICs over that of the phz mutant + DL-1 coculture. Since the tetR and fabI mutations were acquired already in s0 cocultures, we assessed whether DL-1 s1 acquired mutations in tetR or fabI after one serial transfer in PHZ-1-CA. Targeted next-generation sequencing of these genes at high coverage (∼27,000×) found no variants with an allelic frequency of 2% or greater that were absent in G. sulfurreducens not treated with PHZ-1-CA. This result indicates that tetR and fabI mutations are not selected for due to the presence of PHZ-1-CA in particular. This suggests that other P. aeruginosa antibiotics and phenazine derivatives, such as anthranilate, PYO, and 1-hydroxyphenazine, may be driving the selection of these mutations. In agreement with this, PHZ-1-CA was below the detection limits in all cocultures (see Supplemental Methods), as previously observed for P. aeruginosa PAO1 pure cultures grown in minimal medium (57).
