RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Genome mining of strain Tü 2108 leads to the identification of a berninamycin BGC and provides information on berninamycin derivative biosynthesis In a previous study, we established a bioreporter assay panel, suitable for MoA profiling of antibacterial agents, which are secreted into the agar by producer strains. This procedure was used to screen strains from the Tübingen actinomycetes strain collection for novel natural compounds (5). Here, we used the bioreporter strain B. subtilis PbmrC-lacZ that specifically responds to protein synthesis inhibition, or more precisely to ribosomal stalling, as a metabolic stress signal (5). Antibiotic activity was indicated by a zone of growth inhibition in the bioreporter lawn, while the inhibitory effect on protein synthesis was signaled by a blue halo around the inhibition zone as a result of brmC promoter activation that drives β-galactosidase reporter gene expression and associated color change (5). Strain Tü 2108 emerged in this MoA-informed screening process as one of the strains, which yielded a large inhibition zone and a clear blue halo (Figure 1). The implicated PSI produced by the strain was identified as berninamycin C by HPLC-MS analysis (5). For the characterization of the Tü 2108 producer organism, the genomic DNA was sequenced and the full-length genome sequence was analyzed bioinformatically for phylogenetic classification and identification of BGCs. Genome-sequence-based phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Type (Strain) Genome Server v. 1.0 (TYGS) (https://tygs.dsmz.de) (35). TYGS analysis with the genome sequence of Tü 2108 revealed that the strain is most closely related to the type strain Streptomyces atroolivaceus NRRL ISP-5137T (Figure 2). The dDDH value (formula d4) between Tü 2108 and S. atroolivaceus NRRL ISP-5137T was 84.6%, which is above the threshold of 70% commonly used for species delineation. Thus, Tü 2108 belongs to the same species as S. atroolivaceus NRRL ISP-5137T, which has already been described as a berninamycin producer strain (41). To investigate if the berninamycin BGC is present in Tü 2108, the genome sequence was analyzed with the bioinformatic tool antiSMASH v. 6.0 (15), which led to the identification of 38 BGCs, whereby the predicted BGC located on region 6_3 (BGC 6_3) showed ∼100% similarity to the berninamycin A BGC of the berninamycin producer strain Streptomyces bernensis (Supplementary Figure S1, Figure 3). Manual sequence analysis revealed that the antiSMASH database contained an incomplete berninamycin A BGC as a reference (MIBiG accession BGC0001472), lacking the gene berH from the berninamycin A BGC (berA-J) as initially described by Malcolmson et al. (42).This was found after BLAST analysis of each individual gene of BGC 6_3 from Tü 2108 and comparisons with the respective BGC genes from S. bernensis (Table 2). Thus, all genes essential for berninamycin biosynthesis are present in Tü 2108.

Bioinformatic analyses disclose that the berninamycin BGC is surrounded by potential self-resistance genes Berninamycin belongs to the class of pyridine-containing thiopeptides and targets the 50S ribosomal subunit in a similar manner as described for thiostrepton (42). Several berninamycin producer strains are known, whereby the production of berninamycin derivatives differs in the various producer strains (Supplemental material Figure S3). A comparison between the known berninamycin BGC from S. bernensis and the BGC from Tü 2108 revealed that the predicted gene products show high amino acid sequence homologies (90–100%) amongst each other (Table 2). To identify potential self-resistance genes for strain Tü 2108, the genome sequence was analyzed with the bioinformatics software tool ARTS v. 2.0. As mentioned above, ARTS detects potential self-resistance genes based on the following individual three criteria: (i) duplicated core genes, (ii) core genes localized within a BGC and (iii) core genes with incongruent phylogeny (16). For Tü 2108, the suggested self-resistance genes were sorted with regard to genes associated with protein synthesis as a metabolic function. Concerning protein synthesis associated genes, ARTS employs a reference set of 100 core genes related to protein synthesis (16). For Tü 2108 it was found that 15 protein synthesis-associated genes met the above mentioned criteria for resistance patterns: In total, nine duplicated core genes, 13 core genes located in a BGC, and six phylogenetically distinct core genes were predicted (Table 3). The majority of the detected core genes present in a BGC, mapped to the berninamycin cluster BGC 6_3 (Table 2). Here, the core genes are organized at the left and right borders of the berninamycin BGC 6_3 (Figure 3) and code for potential ribosomal proteins (L4, S12, S10, uS7), as well as elongation factors G and TU (Table 2). For instance, ORF 01243 encoding the putative elongation factor TU (EF-TU) was duplicated and phylogenetically distinct from another putative EF-TU encoding gene (TIGR00485) present in the Tü 2108 genome. A similar genetic organization was found for the berninamycin A BGC (berA-J) in S. bernensis (Figure 3). Notably, also a berJ homologous gene is present within BGC 6_3 of Tü 2108, which codes for a potential 23S rRNA methyltransferase, an enzyme well-known for conferring resistance to ribosome-targeting drugs (43). However, this gene, which most likely represents the actual berninamycin self-resistance gene, was not detected with ARTS, which is due to the fact that it was not included in the list of core genes. The predominant occurrence of these protein synthesis-associated core genes in the proximity of the berninamycin BGC indicates a potential linkage to self-resistance mechanisms. This finding supports the hypothesis that resistance genes can provide an indication of the mode of action of a BGC-encoded secondary metabolite. Protein synthesis core genes of Tü 2108 identified with ARTS. Following criteria are listed: gene duplication, phylogenetic gene difference, occurrence of core genes in a biosynthetic gene cluster (BCG). +: criterion fulfilled, –: criterion not fulfilled.

Development of a genome sequenced-based screening approach for the identification of PSI producer strains Based on the knowledge gained above, an in silico screening approach was developed, capitalizing on the occurrence of protein synthesis associated self-resistance genes to evaluate the genetic potential of bacterial strains to produce a PSI. To validate the approach, genome sequences of 47 known PSI producers were analyzed with ARTS. Here, it was found that several known PSI producers showed high numbers (>20) of protein synthesis core genes, fulfilling at least one of the three criteria mentioned for the prediction of self-resistance genes, defined as ‘hit genes’. For example, the anisomycin producer Streptomyces roseochromogenus displayed 42 hit genes and the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea 51 hit genes (Table 4). The majority of the identified hit genes of the PSI producers were characterized as phylogenetic incongruencies (76%) and only a minor part represented core gene duplications (46%) or gene localization within a BGC (26%) (Supplementary Table S3). Among the hit genes, seven core genes appeared regularly, which were rpsE, rpsL, rplC, rplD, rplK, rplQ and rplV encoding for the putative ribosomal proteins S5, S12, L3, L4, L11, L17 and L22, respectively (Table 4). For all these genes, it was shown in previous work that they play an essential role in conferring resistance against PSIs. For example, mutations in rpsE, rpsL, and rplC resulted in altered S5, S12 and L3 proteins that conferred resistance against spectinomycin, streptomycin, and linezolid/tiamulin, respectively, in E. coli (44–46). Mutations in rplD and rplV were shown to result in altered L4 and L22 proteins, respectively, conferring resistance to erythromycin in E. coli (47,48). Mutations in rplK resulted in an altered L11 protein conferring resistance to thiostrepton in Thermus thermophilus (49) and mutations in rplQ resulted in an altered L17 protein conferring resistance to erythromycin in B. subtilis (50). According to these observations, the seven ribosomal genes were regarded as PSI 'resistance indicator genes’ (RI genes). The RI genes were found to be mainly present in PSI producer strains with a high number of PSI hit genes, e.g. S. roseochromogenus and S. erythraea with six and five RI genes, respectively (Table 4). However, some of the RI genes were also found in PSI producers with a lower number of hit genes, such as Streptomyces pristinaespiralis PR11 and Streptomyces pactum, with only one RI gene each. Furthermore, there were also examples of known PSI producers that showed neither a high abundance of hit genes nor any RI gene (Table 4). To examine whether the accumulation of hit and RI genes is a specific phenomenon for PSI producers, we additionally analyzed numerous genome sequences of antibiotic producers, which are known not to produce PSIs as a comparison. Thereby, it was found that the non-PSI producers had generally low numbers of protein synthesis-related hit genes (<20) and none of the strains contained any of the seven RI genes (Table 5). Thus, we concluded that if a bacterial strain has (i) a large number of PSI hit genes (>20) and in addition (ii) two or more RI gene(s) it is likely to be a PSI producer strain.

Based on these findings, we devised a genome sequence-based in silico screening strategy for the identification of potential PSI producers, which was designated as protein synthesis inhibitor (‘psi’) target gene footprinting = Ψ-footprinting approach. The strategy involves the process of screening bacterial genome sequences with ARTS for the presence of a high number (≥20) of PSI hit genes and the abundance of RI genes (at least two), which allows for the identification of potential PSI producer strains. For dereplication purposes, the genome sequence of the identified strain is additionally analyzed with antiSMASH to sort out strains, which harbor BGCs encoding already known PSIs, allowing for the prioritization of strains likely to produce novel PSIs (Figure 4). Figure 4.Graphic illustration of the genome sequenced-based screening approach for the identification of PSI producer strains, designated Ψ-footprinting. Graphic illustration of the genome sequenced-based screening approach for the identification of PSI producer strains, designated Ψ-footprinting. Verification of the Ψ-footprinting method by analyzing PSI producer strains of the Tübingen strain collection To apply the Ψ-footprinting method to the previously discovered PSI producers of the Tübingen strain collection (5), the genomic DNA of the strains Tü 2108, Tü 2975, Tü 3180, Tü 6430, KNN 49.3e and A 4/2 was sequenced and analyzed as described above. A 4/2 was not further evaluated as it produced the eukaryotic PSI cycloheximide. Among the five strains, three (KNN 49.3e, Tü 3180 and Tü 6430) showed large numbers of hit genes, with abundances of 88, 50 and 45, respectively (Table 6). All strains harbored at least one RI gene, whereby for KNN 49.3e all seven RI genes were detected (Table 6). This showcase demonstrates that the Ψ-footprinting method enabled a genome sequence-based identification of three out of five PSI producer strains from the Tübingen strain collection.

Ψ-footprinting method allows to prioritize potential PSI producers from the DSMZ strain collection To apply the Ψ-footprinting approach to so far uncharacterized strains, the method was challenged with numerous genome-sequenced strains from the DSMZ strain collection. Here, the focus was on the analysis of genome sequences from rare actinomycetes in order to increase the probability of finding new substances. 406 actinomycetal genome sequences were examined. 118 genomes (30%) showed a high number of PSI hit genes (>20) (data not shown) and 141 (35%) strains had at least one RI gene (Supplementary Table S4). 110 (27%) of the strains met the two criteria for possible PSI production (≥20 PSI hit genes and at least two RI genes) and thus were candidate strains for PSI production. Genome sequences, which met these criteria, were analyzed with antiSMASH to exclude strains containing an already known PSI BGC. In total, 15 strains were prioritized for further analysis, which harbored up to 71 hit genes and five RI genes, as for example strain Jiangella alkaliphila DSM 45079 (Table 7).

Culture samples were harvested at different time points (4, 7 and 10 days), extracted with ethyl acetate in a ratio of 1:1, concentrated 20-fold in vacuo and then redissolved in methanol. To investigate if the extracts contained substances with protein synthesis inhibiting activity, samples were analyzed using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation (ivTT) assay (31). This cell-free assay uses the E. coli translational machinery to express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a plasmid (pET28a-eGFP), reporting transcription/translation activity by fluorescence emission analysis. First, the assay was validated for the analysis of culture extracts and it was found to tolerate 30 μl of the concentrated culture extracts in a total assay volume of 100 μl without significant interference. Changes in GFP expression were monitored by measuring the fluorescence at 485/520 nm excitation/emission with a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro device and analyzing the data with the i-control™ Microplate Reader Software 1.11. To determine the maximum fluorescence value (GFP fluorescence = 100%), the assay was performed without the addition of antibiotics. As positive controls for effective protein synthesis inhibition, pure tetracycline and apramycin were used, respectively. As negative control, media extracts of the respective culture media (NL800, MS and R5) were tested to exclude that the observed inhibitory effects were caused by media components. Furthermore, extract samples from the strain S. coelicolor M1146 (M1146) were analyzed as a negative control. M1146 is a genetically engineered strain with deleted BGCs and thus lacking any antibiotic production (51). M1146 extracts were analyzed to exclude that the observed inhibitory effects were caused by components from the cell metabolism of actinomycetes. IvTT conducted with the media extract samples as negative controls yielded 70% - 85% maximal GFP fluorescence values and thus had only a minor inhibiting effect on the assay (Figure 5). The same was observed for the culture extracts of M1146, for which the fluorescence values varied between 70% and 90% (Figure 5). The addition of 5 μl tetracycline (15 mg/ml) (tet15) and 5 μl of apramycin (50 mg/ml) (apra50) resulted in very low GFP fluorescence values of 13% and 12%, respectively, indicating a strong inhibition of the ivTT assay (Figure 5). Based on these control measurements, an internal threshold was set, according to which fluorescence values between 0% and 40% were considered to represent specific inhibition of the ivTT assay and values of 0–20% indicate strong inhibition of the assay.

Measurements have been performed in triplicate using the same preparation of S12 extract. IvTT assays with extract samples of strains DSM 44555, DSM 44498 and DSM 44908 showed no significant inhibition of GFP expression and thus the samples obviously did not contain protein synthesis inhibiting substances or at least they were not produced by the strains under the applied cultivation conditions (Supplementary Figure S4). IvTT assays with extract samples from the other twelve strains (DSM 44944, DSM 45888, DSM 45258, DSM 43821, DSM 44073, DSM 45079, DSM 45657, DSM 43813, DSM 43919, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771) yielded significantly low fluorescence values ranging from 6% - 40% relative fluorescence (Supplementary Figure S5) and thus specific inhibition of the assay. This was observed for samples obtained from all tested media, whereby data are shown for the respective best production medium (Figure 6), while the complete dataset can be found in the supplemental material (Supplementary Figure S5). ivTT assays were additionally carried out with eleven culture extract sample from random strains of the Tübingen strain collection, of which none led to a specific inhibition (<40% fluorescence) of the assay, demonstrating that none of the strains produced a substance with PSI activity (Supplementary Figure S6).

Measurements have been performed in triplicate using the same preparation of S12 extract. IvTT assays with culture extracts of DSM 43813, DSM 45079, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771 grown in R5 resulted in the lowest fluorescence values (<20% maximal fluorescence), which indicated strong inhibition of the GFP expression, representatively shown for sample DSM 43813 (Figure 6, Supplementary Figure S5). Samples of strains DSM 43813 and DSM 45079 from sampling time points at days 7 and 10, respectively, reduced fluorescence to values of 17% and 12%, respectively (Figure 6). Samples of strains DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771 showed the strongest inhibiting effect for sampling time points at days 4, 7 and 10 with residual fluorescence values of 3%, 6% and 7%, respectively (Figure 6, Supplementary Figure S5). Since culture extracts of these five strains specifically inhibited the ivTT assay, it could be concluded that they interfere with protein expression and may contain a PSI. Thus, using the Ψ-footprinting-based prioritization of actinomycetes strains, potential PSI production was detected by ivTT assays for twelve out of the 15 (80%) selected DSM strains. Identification of PSI substances from Ψ-footprinting-prioritized strains of the DSMZ strain collection In order to identify the PSIs produced by the selected and analyzed DSM strains, the culture extracts were purified by semi-preparative HPLC followed by HPLC-MS analysis of the pre-purified substances. For these analyses, we focused on samples that showed the strongest inhibition of the ivTT assays, which included DSM 43813, DSM 45079, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771. Methanolic culture extracts were prepared from samples harvested at the optimal production time point as reported above and protein synthesis inhibiting activity was verified in ivTT assays. For compound purification, semi-preparative HPLC was performed with the culture extracts. The fractions were collected in time-based mode every minute for 25 min and were analyzed for PSI activity via ivTT. Assay analysis revealed that individual purified fractions from all five DSM strain samples (DSM 43813, DSM 45079, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771) showed significant inhibition of the ivTT assay (Figure 7, Supplementary Figures S7-S10). Interestingly, for all five extracts, fraction 8 (F8) showed the strongest inhibition, with fluorescence values of 9%, 30%, 4%, 33% and 7%, respectively (Figure 7, Supplementary Figures S7-S10), which suggested that F8 contained a protein synthesis inhibiting substance. HPLC-MS analysis of all extract samples and F8 fractions was performed to identify the respective PSI. The HPLC chromatograms of the extract samples of F8 of DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218, and DSM 44771 of F8 showed a prominent peak at a retention time (RT) 7.2 min, as representatively shown for the sample DSM 25218 (Figure 8A). HPLC-MS analysis of the F8 samples of DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771 revealed one distinct peak in positive and negative mode at RT 7.2 min (Figure 8B and C). This peak showed a characteristic UV–Vis spectrum with three λmax at 206 , 248 and 314 nm, respectively (Figure 8D). The peak was detected in positive mode at m/z = 424.2 [M + H]+ and in negative mode at m/z = 422.1 [M–H]– (Figure 8B and C). The mass of m/z = 423 is consistent with the mass of amicoumacin A (molecular weight 423.5; molecular formula C20H29N3O7) (52). The peak at RT 7.4 shows a prominent shoulder (Figure 8A). This often results due to the presence of two similar substances, which were not separated chromatographically. The shoulder showed a UV–Vis spectrum similar to that of amicoumacin A (Fig. 8G versus D). The UV–Vis spectrum of the peak was compared with an internal database, matching the entry of amicoumacin B (Figure 8G). This peak was detected in positive mode at m/z = 425.1 [M + H]+ and in negative mode at m/z = 423.1 [M–H]– (Figure 8E and F). The mass of m/z = 424 is consistent with the mass of amicoumacin B (molecular weight 424.4; molecular formula C20H28N2O8) (52). Amicoumacin A and B production have further been confirmed by high-resolution MS/MS (HRMS) analysis with F8 sample of DSM 45408, representatively (Supplementary Figure S11). The data obtained in this study (UV–Vis spectrum in combination with RT and mass of the peaks) showed that F8 of the samples DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218 and DSM 44771 contained the PSIs amicoumacin A and B. Regarding F8 of strain DSM 45079, the mass of amicoumacin was not detected in this sample, and no mass or UV–Vis spectra of known PSIs could be assigned. It cannot be ruled out that amicoumacin was present in this sample in a very low concentration, which would fit to the lower inhibitory effect in the ivTT assay. On the other hand, this result could also indicate that the strain produces a novel PSI, but further cultivation and purification steps are necessary to allow accurate conclusions. Figure 7.

Amicoumacins are known PSIs, belonging to a class of isocoumarin antibiotics with antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities (53). They also show potent antibacterial activities against clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (54,55). Amicoumacin affects bacterial growth by binding to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, specifically at the E-site codon of the mRNA, and thereby inhibits the translation process. This position is a rather unusual target site and implies a unique way of translation inhibition for amicoumacin (56). Amicoumacin has been reported as a natural product from different microbial producers, involving Gram-positive bacteria, such as certain representatives of Bacillus and Nocardia (54,57,58) but also the Gram-negative producer Xenorhabdus bovienii (53). In addition, our data revealed that amicoumacin is produced by various types of actinomycetes, namely Saccharopolyspora flava DSM 44771, Micromonospora aurantiaca DSM 43813, Nocardioides albertanoniae DSM 25218, and Geodermatophilus nigrescens DSM 45408, which belong to different orders of the phylum Actinobacteria, such as Pseudonocardiales, Micromonosporales, Propionobacteriales, and Geodermatophilales, respectively (Supplementary Figure S12). Thus, the ability to produce amicoumacin seems to be quite conserved across different groups of bacterial organisms, hinting at a so far unknown general biological function. The reason why we have not been able to dereplicate the substance based on BGC predictions is that the respective amicoumacin BGCs could not be identified by antiSMASH analysis. The amicoumacin BGC was described as nonribosomal peptide-polyketide hybrid BGC for the producer strain Xenorhabdus bovieni (53). However, the BGC is not part of the MIBiG repository and thus is not accessible as a reference in the antiSMASH database, which is why the BGCs were not identified by antiSMASH analysis for the amicoumacin producers of the DSMZ strain collection. Remarkably, also detailed manual sequence analyses did not lead to the identification of the amicoumacin BGCs. We therefore assume that the actinobacterial amicoumacin biosynthesis (high GC content bacteria) proceeds differently and is encoded by a strikingly different type of BGC than in the known producers of Xenorhabdus and Bacillus (low GC content bacteria). If so, this would speak for a convergent evolution of the amicoumacin BGCs in the phylogenetically distantly related producer strains. The fact that we have detected amicoumacin as PSI in our samples underscores the feasibility and reliability of the Ψ-footprinting strategy. The advantage of this method is that it is purely in silico-based. Conventional antibiotic screening approaches are generally much more labor-intensive since they involve screening a large number of strains, followed by extensive compound purifications and chemical analytics with the risk that the identified bioactive substance is already known. The Ψ-footprinting strategy is a fast and efficient method to specifically prioritize potential producers of PSIs based on genome-sequence information and thereby speeds up the lead discovery process. Until now, it was not possible to transfer this method to antibiotics with a different mode of action. The derived in silico strategy is so far only applicable for the prioritization of potential PSI producer strains, due to the number of core genes used as a reference set in the ARTS analysis. For the metabolic function of protein synthesis ∼100 core genes are defined in the reference set, which are significantly lower core gene numbers for other metabolic functions, such as DNA metabolism- or cell envelope-associated functions (16). Certainly, not all PSI producers can be detected with the Ψ-footprinting approach, as for example shown for Streptomyces griseus, a known producer of the PSI streptomycin (Table 4). Another limitation of the approach might be that it employs known RI genes as indicator genes, which could prevent the discovery of really novel PSIs with different MoAs. In this context, however, it would be possible to adopt a less stringent Ψ-footprinting run and exclude RI genes as a selection criterion, which would allow for a more explorative screening attempt. However, following the defined criteria for Ψ-footprinting, which are (i) a high number (≥20) of PSI hit genes and (ii) the additional abundance of RI genes, allows a reliable pre-selection of potential PSI producers. This was proven by the identification of twelve PSI producer strains from the 15 Ψ-selected strains in the current study, which inhibited protein synthesis in ivTT assays. In addition, the responsible PSI substances (amicoumacin A and B) were identified for four of these strains. Prioritized strains for which protein synthesis inhibiting activities were observed but no PSI identified yet are subject to ongoing work.
