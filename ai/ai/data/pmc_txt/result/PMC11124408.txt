3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Overexpression of Active PPTase to Endow B. subtilis 168 with the Ability to Synthesise Surfactin PPTase encoded by sfp is responsible for connecting the long arm of coenzyme A (CoA), 4′-phosphopantothenamine, to the conserved serine residue in the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP), which converts PCP from an inactive apo-form to active holo-form, thereby initiating surfactin synthesis [41]. Due to the presence of an additional T496 base in the nucleotide sequence of sfp in B. subtilis 168, its transcription is terminated prematurely (Figure S1). Therefore, sfp is an inactive pseudogene in B. subtilis 168. Indeed, no surfactin was detected in the supernatant of its fermentation broth (Figure 2A and Figure S2A). To make the PPTase active, we designed primers to amplify the preceding and following nucleotide sequences of the sfp gene, removing the T496 base in the process. These two nucleotide sequences were spliced together through overlapping PCR, then spliced with the strong TP2 promoter [36] to integrate into the yrpC locus of the genome of strain BS168N, yielding recombinant strain BSSF2 (Table 1). In addition, we constructed yrpC gene knockout strain BSSF1 as a control for BSSF2. In B. subtilis, yrpC encodes glutamate racemase, which catalyses the racemisation of L-glutamate to produce D-glutamate [42]. L-glutamate is one of the precursors for synthesising surfactin, so the knockout of yrpC should reduce the consumption of L-glutamate. Moreover, Wang et al. [29] inhibited the expression of yrpC using CRISPRi technology, which indeed promoted surfactin synthesis. After 48 h of fermentation, strain BSSF2 produced 747.5 ± 6.5 mg/L of surfactin (Figure 2A and Figure S2B). There were four components of the surfactin standards, corresponding to peaks 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Figure S2C,D). The differences between them were the amino acid residues at positions 2, 4 and 7 of the circular peptide (leucine, isoleucine or valine) and the length of the carbon chain (C13 to C15) [31]. The relative transcriptional level of sfp in BSSF2 was increased 17.8-fold relative to BSSF1 (Figure 2B). Compared to previous studies [21,29,30], overexpression of PPTase led to different levels of surfactin production, possibly due to the varying activities or expression levels of PPTases from different sources. The amino acid sequences of PPTase from B. amyloliquefaciens MT45 (GenBank: ASF27580.1), B. amyloliquefaciens DSM7 (GenBank: CBI41443.1), B. velezensis BS-37 (GenBank: AWG39808.1) and the active PPTase from B. subtilis 168 are not completely identical, as shown in the alignment (Figure S3). The above results indicated that PPTase was the key enzyme for B. subtilis to synthesise surfactin, and the recovery of endogenous PPTase activity endowed B. subtilis 168 with the ability to produce surfactin. 3.2. Effects of Plipastatin Synthetase and Phosphotransferase Deficiency on Surfactin Synthesis In B. subtilis, the ppsABCDE operon encodes plipastatin synthase that catalyses the synthesis of plipastatin from ten amino acids, including L-glutamate, D-alanine and L-tyrosine, along with hydroxyl fatty acids [43]. To increase the flow of amino acids and hydroxyl fatty acids towards surfactin synthesis, the ppsD gene in the ppsABCDE operon was knocked out, resulting in knockout strain BSSF3. The fermentation results showed that there was almost no change in surfactin production (Figure 3). Coutte et al. [44] inserted the spectacomycin resistance gene spc into ppsA to disrupt plipastatin synthesis in B. subtilis, resulting in a 80.7% increase in surfactin production after 24 h of fermentation in a Landy medium and a 2.9% decrease after 48 h of fermentation. The above results indicated that the effect of pps disruption on surfactin production was related to the fermentation medium and fermentation time. In B. subtilis 168, YvkC may consume ATP and catalyse the synthesis of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate. In addition, the yvkC gene encodes flavonoid phosphate synthetase, which catalyses the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of flavonoids to generate flavonoid monophosphates, AMP and orthophosphate [45]. To block gluconeogenesis and flavonoid monophosphate synthesis and reduce ATP consumption, the yvkC gene in the genome of BSSF3 was knocked out, resulting in knockout strain BSSF4. The fermentation results indicated that this had no significant positive effect on the synthesis of surfactin (Figure 3). Although surfactin synthesis requires ATP, the weaker activity of YvkC may result in less ATP consumption by its catalytic reaction and its knockout having no significant positive effect on surfactin synthesis. 3.3. Overexpression and Identification of a Surfactin Transporter to Enhance Surfactin Synthesis Since surfactin accumulates excessively in cells, it may disrupt the integrity of cell membranes [31], thereby affecting normal cell function and even leading to cell death, which is obviously disadvantageous for the sustained synthesis of surfactin. Therefore, promoting surfactin secretion may improve surfactin production. In B. subtilis 168, yerP (also known as swrC) encodes a protein similar to the acriflavin resistance protein that is involved in surfactin efflux [46], and the ycxA gene, located downstream of the srfA operon, encodes a protein homologous to members of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) [47]. In Bacillus thuringiensis, the krsE gene encodes an efflux protein involved in lipopeptide efflux [48]. The amino acid sequence of KrsE (GenBank: AIG20548.1) of B. thuringiensis was BLAST in the B. subtilis genome database, and it was found that YfiS shares the highest homology with KrsE (Figure S4). In B. subtilis 168, yfiS encodes a protein similar to multidrug resistance proteins. The endogenous genes yerP, yfiS and ycxA were separately integrated into the yvkC locus of the BSSF3 genome under the control of the P43 promoter [37], resulting in strains BSSF51, BSSF52 and BSSF53. After 48 h of fermentation, their surfactin production reached 809.3 ± 24.8 mg/L, 1060.7 ± 89.4 mg/L and 798.7 ± 61.4 mg/L, respectively, increased by 4.9%, 37.4% and 3.5%, respectively, compared to that of control strain BSSF4 (771.7 ± 17.3 mg/L; Figure 4A). Moreover, the growth of strain BSSF52 overexpressing yfiS was better than that of control strain BSSF4 and recombinant strains BSSF51 and BSSF53, during the first 24 h of fermentation (Figure S5C). The qRT-PCR results showed that adding one copy number to the genome resulted in a 0.70-fold (Figure 4B), 1.09-fold (Figure 4C) and 2.88-fold (Figure 4D) increase in the relative transcriptional levels of mRNAs of genes yerP, yfiS and ycxA, respectively. Overexpressing ycxA resulted in the largest increase in the transcriptional level, but its promotion effect on surfactin synthesis was the weakest. Considering that the translation of ycxA is likely to require elongation factor P (Efp) due to the presence of several consecutive proline residues [49], we constructed artificial operon P43-ycxA-efp and integrated it into the yvkC locus of the BSSF3 genome to obtain strain BSSF54. Although the relative transcriptional level of efp was increased by 1.81-fold (Figure 4E), co-expression of ycxA and efp resulted in a 46.3% decrease in surfactin production compared to control strain BSSF53 overexpressing ycxA alone (Figure 4F) and a slight decrease in strain growth (Figure S5D). The above results indicated that YfiS was mainly responsible for surfactin efflux under the culture conditions of this study. 3.4. Enhancing Transcription of the srfA Operon to Promote Surfactin Synthesis The nucleotide sequence of the srfA operon is up to 27 kb, making it difficult to increase its transcriptional level through overexpression. However, the promoter can determine the gene transcriptional level, so we attempted replacing the native promoter of the srfA operon. To this end, we used constitutive promoters PHpaII, P43 and PSB [38] to replace the native promoter of the srfA operon in the genome of strain BSSF52, resulting in recombinant strains BSSF61, BSSF62 and BSSF63. The fermentation results showed that the surfactin production was only 16.5 ± 1.3 mg/L, 3.1 ± 0.2 mg/L and 7.1 ± 0.1 mg/L, respectively (Figure 5A), decreased by 98.4%, 99.7% and 99.3% compared to BSSF52. The qRT-PCR results showed that the relative transcriptional levels of srfAA and srfAB in the srfA operon decreased by varying degrees (Figure 5B). This was consistent with the previous research by Willenbacher et al. [50] and Jiao et al. [51]. The surfactin production of B. subtilis DSM 10T was decreased to 0.04 g/L from 0.62 g/L when the Pveg promoter replaced the promoter of the srfA operon [50]. The ability of B. subtilis THY-7 to synthesise surfactin was lost when the PgroE promoter induced by L-arabinose was used as a replacement [51]. Therefore, the initial transcription effect of these three promoters was not as strong as that of the native promoter of the srfA operon. The global regulatory factor CodY recognises GTP and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) as specific signals and affects the expression of >100 genes associated with metabolism [52]. CodY binds to the promoter of the srfA operon, occupying the binding site between DNA and positive regulatory proteins, leading to inhibition of the transcription of this operon [53]. We knocked out the codY gene of strain BSSF52 to generate knockout strain BSSF64. Its surfactin titre was 1601.8 ± 91.9 mg/L (Figure 5C), 51% higher than that of control strain BSSF52, as in accordance with a previous report, in which this knockout resulted in a 17.3% increase [21]. The relative transcriptional levels of srfAA and srfAB increased by 1.31-fold and 0.97-fold, respectively (Figure 5D). This indicated that the knockout of codY could indeed alleviate the partial regulation of the srfA operon, thereby increasing its transcription and promoting the expression of surfactin synthase, significantly improving surfactin synthesis. 3.5. Increasing Surfactin Production through Fed-Batch Fermentation To improve the fermentation level of surfactin, we performed fed-batch fermentation of recombinant strain BSSF64 in a 5 L fermenter. After 6 h of fermentation, a large number of bubbles were evident, and the addition of soybean oil and polyether defoamer had no defoaming effect. Hence, fermentation could not proceed normally. A defoaming effect could only be achieved by adding organosilicon defoamer. After 36 h of fermentation, the maximum OD600 value of BSSF64 was 11.54 ± 1.83 (Figure 6A). Although its growth was almost twice that of flask fermentation, it was far below the growth achieved when using engineered B. subtilis for fed-batch fermentation to produce other high value-added chemicals [34,54]. The surfactin titres (yields) after fermentation for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h were 0.94 ± 0.15 g/L (0.22 ± 0.01 g/g DCW), 1.94 g/L (0.25 ± 0.01 g/g DCW), 3.89 ± 0.07 g/L (0.63 ± 0.02 g/g DCW) and 3.35 ± 0.17 g/L (0.52 ± 0.04 g/g DCW), respectively (Figure 6B). This might be due to inappropriate fermentation conditions leading to poor growth or to the toxicity of surfactin or organosilicon defoamer toward cells, which may have inhibited bacterial growth and surfactin synthesis. By optimising the fermentation medium and conditions alone, the OD600 of B. subtilis ATCC 21332 reached 60, and surfactin production was increased from 335 mg/L to 5.3 g/L [18]. Therefore, optimising the fermentation conditions, including carbon sources, nitrogen sources, pH, inoculum size and metal ions by adding Fe nanoparticles [55] or EDTA-Fe2+ [56], may be crucial for improving surfactin production in the future. Regarding the foaming phenomenon, a two-compartment biofilm bioreactor [57] or a foam trap [58] could be designed to avoid the addition of organosilicon defoamer.
