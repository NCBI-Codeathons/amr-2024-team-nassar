Results Cloning, Gene
Expression, and Purification of BlmB and TlmB The blmB gene from S. verticillus ATCC15003
and the tlmB gene from Sa. hindustanus E465-94 ATCC31158 were amplified by PCR, cloned into pET14b to afford
pBS64 and pBS8019, respectively, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for overexpression. BlmB and TlmB were overproduced as
N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins and purified to
homogeneity by Ni-NTA agarose affinity chromatography. The purified
proteins showed single bands upon SDS–PAGE analysis consistent
with the predicted molecular masses of BlmB (34388.8 Da) and TlmB
(34422.2 Da) (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). BlmB and TlmB Acetylate the Metal-Free Forms of BLM B2, TLM
A, PLM D1, and ZBM As previously reported,22 BlmB is unable to catalyze the acetylation of metal-bound
BLMs. Incubation of 500 μM Cu(II)-BLM B2 with 1 mM acetyl-CoA
and 485 nM BlmB or TlmB showed <4% turnover after 30 min. The addition
of EDTA led to >80% turnover of BLM B2 under the same conditions
(Figure
S3 of the Supporting Information). The
formation of acetylated BLM B2 was confirmed by HR-MALDI-MS. An end point assay utilizing 14C-labeled acetyl-CoA ([acetyl-1-14C]acetyl-CoA), BLM B2 or PLM D1, and
BlmB further confirmed the metal-free antibiotics as the preferred
forms of the substrates. Metal-free BLM B2 and Cu(II)-bound BLM B2
or PLM D1 in the presence of EDTA showed significant turnover compared
to that of the Cu(II)-bound antibiotic in the absence of EDTA (Figure
S4 of the Supporting Information). Although previous studies reported BlmB did not acetylate bleomycinic
acid or PLM,21,32 our previous work on isolating
TLMs30 and ZBM16,31 afforded us the opportunity to examine the substrate flexibility
of BlmB comparatively with each of the four members of the BLM family.
Both BlmB and TlmB were assayed using Cu(II)-BLM B2, TLM A, Cu(II)-PLM
D1, or Cu(II)-ZBM as a substrate with EDTA included in each reaction
mixture. After 30 min, the reactions were quenched by boiling, and
CuSO4 was added to simplify HPLC analysis as the copper-bound
and metal-free antibiotics elute at different retention times. HPLC
analysis of each reaction mixture confirmed that both BlmB and TlmB
are capable of acetylating BLM B2, TLM A, PLM D1, and ZBM (Figure 2). Each acetylated product was confirmed by HR-MALDI-MS. Figure 2BlmB and

Preference for Any Member of the BLM Family Michaelis–Menten
kinetic parameters for the four selected members of the BLM family,
each in its metal-free form, are listed in Table 1. Rates (kcat) and Michaelis constants (KM) were determined
from a nonlinear regression fit of initial velocities versus concentration
(Figures S5 and S6 of the Supporting Information). For BlmB, the KM for acetyl-CoA was
determined to be 19 μM, which corresponded well with the previously
reported value of 12 μM.22 Previous
kinetic studies with BlmB showed substrate inhibition at 12 μM
BLM A2 at pH >6.0.22 The reported KM value for BLM A2 (at pH 6.0) was 11 μM,22 correlating well with a previous KM value for BLM A2 of 13 μM.21 In our hands, BlmB and TlmB showed no substrate inhibition
at pH 7.5 yet similar KM values of 15
and 19 μM, respectively, for BLM B2. In fact, each member of
the BLM family had comparable KM values
for both BlmB and TlmB. Rates (kcat) for
each substrate also had similar values, which were comparable with
previously reported values using BLM A2,21,22 with only ZBM showing a modest enhancement in rate versus those
of the other members of the BLM family. Kinetic

Possess a blmB/tlmB Homologue Outside
the Cloned zbm Gene Cluster Given the ability
of BlmB and
TlmB to efficiently acetylate ZBM in vitro, it is
surprising that the cloned zbm gene cluster does
not possess a blmB/tlmB homologue.
To determine if a blmB/tlmB homologue
resides outside the cloned zbm gene cluster, we deleted
the zbm gene cluster from S. flavoviridis SB9001, a ZBM overproducer derived from the wild-type S.
flavoviridis ATCC21892 strain,16 to afford recombinant strain S. flavoviridis SB9031;
the ΔzbmA-orf38 genotype of S. flavoviridis SB9031 was confirmed by Southern analysis
(Figure S7 of the Supporting Information). S. flavoviridis SB9031 is incapable of ZBM production
and eliminates the only known form of self-resistance to ZBM, the
ZBM-binding protein ZbmA. The susceptibility of S. flavoviridis SB9031 to Cu(II)-ZBM was determined using the disk diffusion assay.
While S. flavoviridis SB9001 showed resistance up
to 20 μg of ZBM per disk, the S. flavoviridis SB9031 mutant was sensitive at quantities as low as 0.5–1
μg of ZBM per disk, excluding the existence of other resistance
elements on the S. flavoviridis SB9031 genome (Figure 3A). Figure 3Disk diffusion assays for Cu(II)-ZBM susceptibility of

with 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 μg of Cu(II)-ZBM (clockwise

with 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 μg of Cu(II)-ZBM (clockwise
from the top right filter, respectively). Expression of blmB Confers ZBM Resistance in S. flavoviridisin Vivo To determine
if BlmB is capable of acetylating ZBM in vivo, as
demonstrated in vitro, two blmB expression
plasmids, pBS65 and pBS66, placing blmB under its
putative native promoter and the strong promoter ErmE* to ensure its expression in Streptomyces, respectively,
were constructed. Introduction of pBS65 and pBS66 into S.
flavoviridis SB9001 and SB9031, respectively, afforded recombinant
strains SB9032, SB9033, SB9034, and SB9035. These strains were assayed
for Cu(II)-ZBM susceptibility using the disk diffusion assay with
the parent S. flavoviridis SB9001 and SB9031 strains
as controls. Expression of blmB in SB9031 indeed
resulted in a significant increase in ZBM resistance. This was evident
in S. flavoviridis SB9034, which showed resistance
up to 10 μg of ZBM per disk, an increase of >10-fold versus
that of the parent mutant SB9031. S. flavoviridis SB9035 showed a complete recovery of ZBM resistance as compared
to the parent wild-type strain SB9001, presumably because of the enhanced
expression of blmB under ErmE* (Figure 3B). Similarly, expression of blmB in S. flavoviridis SB9001 also increased the level
of ZBM resistance; this was more apparent in S. flavoviridis SB9033, where blmB expression was enhanced by ErmE*, than in SB9032 (Figure S8 of the Supporting Information).
