RESULTS Minimum inhibitory concentration assay using clinical isolates of SA resistant strains In order assess the potency of mycs against SA resistant strains MSSA as well as MRSA, broth microdilution assays were performed. We tested and determined minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 26 clinically isolated SA strains, including Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with some pvl positive and a single ATCC strain (described in Materials and Methods). The susceptibility range of the strains in response to each antibiotic tested is represented by a green heat map (Table 1). Twenty strains were resistant to ery and azi (ery/azi), among these, 12 were susceptible to myc I, II and IV (mycs). Six clinically isolated strains were ery-azi as well as myc I, II and IV susceptible whereas eight strains were resistant toward all compounds tested. From these broth microdilution assays, we concluded that mycs MIC values are in the same range compared to ery and azi, highlighting their clinical potential. Furthermore, a dozen strains were ery–azi resistant, yet mycs susceptible. These results encouraged us to investigate the mechanism by which myc may overcome the resistance mechanism. Disk diffusion assay for detection of erythromycin-inducible resistance to clindamycin In order to study the mechanism that allows the mycs to overcome resistance against ery, and their potential for the treatment of clinically isolated resistant SA bacteria, a disk diffusion assay was performed. Cli, a lincosamide antibiotic, which cannot activate the inducible MLSB genes, is a common choice in the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections caused by staphylococci, particularly for patients allergic to penicillin (44). Although cli and ery target the ribosome, both have unique binding pockets yet share the A2058 binding site (45). Misidentification of MLSBi, caused by the ery-resistance inducible methylase (erm) may lead to failed cli treatment (46). Thus, a D-test was performed to assess whether MLSBi resistance by the erm gene was induced by the presence of ery but not by cli. In this test, a D-shaped inhibition zone indicates an induced enzyme phenotype, and this confers cross-resistance to both drugs (44) (see Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S2). Summary of disk diffusion assay . The MIC test (Table 1) indicated that 12 strains that are resistant to ery-azi remain susceptible to myc I, II and IV. These strains were then employed in a disk diffusion assay to visualize their activity. For the control experiment, we used a strain (SA10499) that was susceptible towards ery-azi and mycs, a strain (SA10645) that was resistant to ery-azi and mycs, and three ATCC strains: ATCC 25923 (a susceptible strain), ATCC BAA977 (bearing inducible ermA (MLSBi)) and ATCC BAA976 (known MRSA ery susceptible strain). The pattern of the clearance zone of each tested strain is described according to the experimental results obtained for each plate tested and is explained using the disk diffusion test scheme (Table 2, Right). A MLSBi inducible resistance mechanism affects the shape of the clearance zone, and a D shaped curve is observed when it occurs. The scheme describes all possible expected results due to variability in susceptibility/resistance scenarios where (1) and (2) represent disks soaked with antibiotics (as specified in the header of each row), placed in close proximity on an agar plate. Possible results are iR (inducible resistance) induced by macrolides, most probably by MLSBi mechanism, where the binding site of compound no. 2 is overlapping the binding site of compound no. 1. Therefore, the low concentrations of compound no. 1 triggered resistance towards compound no. 2. R/S—no inducible resistance on compound no. 2 by compound no. 1. R/R—resistance towards compound no. 1 and compound no. 2, S/S—susceptible towards both compounds. The different colors in the table correlate to the colors of the scheme labels. Comparing the disk diffusion assay results of the ery/cli and ery/myc I assays, we observed that ery induced equivalent levels of resistance toward cli and myc I. Thus, we conclude that ery is the inducer antibiotic that activates this specific resistance mechanism. In the myc I/cli plates none of these compounds activate the MLSBi inducible resistance mechanism. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of ermA and ermC The ability of a macrolide to overcome resistance mechanisms is critical for efficacy, and thus, we sought to identify the specific resistance mechanisms induced by ery, in these ten strains. The ermA and ermC resistance genes are frequently present in SA clinically isolated strains (44), therefore a direct PCR reaction was conducted to determine their presence. Table 3 summarises the PCR assays performed to identify the presence of ermA and ermC using ten ery-azi resistant/myc susceptible strains as well as a single ery-azi/myc susceptible (strain SA10499), and a single ery-azi/myc resistant (strain SA10645) strains. Two strains were identified as ermC positive, four strains were identified as ermA positive and the remaining four strains were ermA and ermC negative.

Based on the MIC tests, disk diffusion assays (Tables 1 and 2), and PCR results (Table 3), the strains were sorted into four classes: (I) SA strains where mycs overcome ery resistance by an unknown ery-inducible mechanism (II) SA strains where mycs overcome ery resistance from an inducible ermC mechanism, (III) SA strains where mycs overcome ery resistance from an inducible ermA mechanism, (IV) SA strain with constitutive ermA resistance or combination of ermA with other unknown mechanism that mycs do not overcome. Furthermore, most MSSA strains were negative towards ermA and ermC, yet susceptible to mycs. Structural studies Complete crystallographic data sets of D50S in complex with myc I, myc II and myc IV yielded electron density maps at 3.22, 3.42 and 3.42 Å resolution (Table 4), respectively. The crystal structures indicate that the mycs bind at the upper rim of the nascent peptide exit tunnel (NPET) in close proximity to the PTC (Figure 2A–C is shown for orienting the reader in the mycs binding site with respect to the binding sites of modelled tRNA molecules and a nascent polypeptide chain), in agreement with other known macrolides bound to the large ribosomal subunit (6,7,47–50). In each example, the locations and conformations of the bound antibiotic could be unambiguously resolved as observed from the difference electron density map (Figure 2D–F).

Mycs binding pocket description All three mycs bind the ribosome at the upper part of the NPET, in a very similar orientation (Figure 2G), and form hydrogen bonds between the desosamine C2 hydroxyl and N1 of A2058 and between the mycinose C4 hydroxyl and O6 of A752 (Figure 3B–D). The macrolactone ring and the desosamine sugar interact through Van der Waals interactions with the rRNA domain V, residues A2058, A2059, A2062, G2505, U2609 and U/C2611 (Figure 3A). The mycinose orientation reveals Van der Waals interactions with rRNA domain II, helix 35, residues U746, G748, A751, A752 (Figure 3A), which are part of the NPET.

Orientation of nucleotides at the mycs binding site Superposition of the structures of the three mycs (myc I, myc II and myc IV) complexes reveals that the spatial orientations of the three antibiotics are very similar (Figure 3E, F and Supplementary Figure S5). Structural changes due to antibiotic binding could be identified by superpositioning of the complex structures of D50S with myc I (D50S-myc I), myc II (D50S-myc II) and myc IV (D50S-myc IV) and the apo ribosome structure (PDB: 2ZJR) (Figure 3E and F). Upon mycs binding, the nitrogen base of nucleotide U746 (C759) shifts by ∼3Å relative to the apo D50S subunit. In addition, the side chain of rProtein uL22 R111 (SA numbering, K90 in E. coli) may also be displaced to avoid clashing with the antibiotic molecules. R111 could not be modeled in the mycs complexes due to lack of an electron density map for this bulky side chain, seemingly because the arginine side chain becomes flexible upon antibiotic binding. Nucleotide A2062 (A2045), a flexible moiety within the PTC (34) is flipped 90° and interacts hydrophobically with the mycs desosamine sugar. Furthermore, U790 (C803), a more distant domain II 23S rRNA nucleotide, that is located in the tunnel's upper rim, is a first shell nucleotide, without direct interaction with the antibiotic, which appears to be dynamic in the tunnel of the D50S-mycs complex structures.
