Results  Expression of miR-27b and Frizzled-7 (FZD7) mRNA in OSCC cisplatin-sensitive and drug-resistant patients As shown in Fig. 1, by detecting the expression of miR-27b and FZD7 in oral cancer tissues of OSCC-resistant patients and OSCC-cisplatin-sensitive patients, we found that the expression level of miR-27b in cisplatin-sensitive OSCC patients was significantly higher (P<0.05), and the expression of FZD7 in cisplatin-resistant patients was significantly higher (P<0.05). The results suggest that the expression of miR-27b and FDZ7 may be associated with cisplatin resistance in OSCC patients. Effect of miR-27b overexpression on the formation of resistant OSCC cell clones To investigate the effect of miR-27b overexpression on the proliferation of drug-resistant OSCC cells, we first examined the difference in the ability of forming cell clones in the two groups. The results are shown in Fig. 2. The number of clones on the 10th day of the DRG and DRG+miR-27b mimic groups were 133.23±12.78 vs. 28.89±7.12, respectively (P<0.05). It was demonstrated that miR-27b can increase the sensitivity of OSCC cells to cisplatin by inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. Effect of miR-27b overexpression on migration of drug-resistant OSCC cells The effect of miR-27b overexpression on the migration ability of drug-resistant OSCC cells was also investigated. The results of the scratch test showed (Fig. 3) that miR-27b inhibited the migration ability of drug-resistant OSCC cells by ~2.67-fold (P<0.05). Effect of miR-27b overexpression on invasion of drug-resistant OSCC cells In addition, we also used Transwell chambers to assess the invasive ability of OSCC-resistant cells. The results showed (Fig. 4) that miR-27b significantly inhibited the invasive ability of drug-resistant cancer cells. The number of invasive cells of OSCC-resistant cells in the DRG and DRG+miR-27b mimic groups was 91.13±1.45 vs. 23.34±4.52(P<0.05). Effect of miR-27b overexpression on apoptosis of drug-resistant OSCC cells Considering that tumor cell apoptosis is an important indicator for assessing the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, we further tested the apoptosis rate of the two groups by flow cytometry. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The apoptosis rates of the DRG and DRG+miR-27b mimic groups were 1.42±0.39 vs. 19.56±1.92%, respectively (P<0.05). Hoechst 33258 staining results of two groups of cells We further evaluated the apoptosis of the two groups of cells using Hoechst 33258 staining. The results showed that the number of apoptotic cells in the DRG+miR-27b mimic group was 3.78 times higher than that in the DRG group (P<0.05). This result further confirmed that the inhibitory effect of miR-27b on cisplatin resistance in OSCC cells may be related to its pro-apoptotic effect. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Effect of miR-27b overexpression on FZD7/β-catenin signaling pathway in drug-resistant OSCC cells Finally, we further examined the effect of miR-27b overexpression on the expression of FZD7/β-catenin protein in the classical pathway of tumor cell resistance. The results showed that the expression levels of FZD7 and β-catenin were inhibited after overexpression of miR-27b (P<0.05). Therefore, we speculated that the mechanism of miR-27b increasing cisplatin sensitivity in OSCC cells may be related to the suppression of FZD7/β-catenin signaling pathway. The results are shown in Fig. 7.
