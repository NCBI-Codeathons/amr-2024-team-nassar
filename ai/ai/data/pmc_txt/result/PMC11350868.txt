2. Results 2.1. Exploration of Antimicrobial-Producing Bacterial Isolates from Mangrove Sediments Sediment samples were collected from five different locations in the mangrove area in the Pak Banang district, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. The pH values of the sediments ranged from 6.26 to 8.00 and the salinity of the sediments ranged from 9.00 to 10.00 ppt. All colonies obtained from Mueller Hinton (MH) agar, Zobell Marine (ZM) agar, and Starch Casein (SC) agar were screened for anti-MRSA activity against MRSA strain 2468 using the soft agar overlay method. The isolates active against MRSA were verified by subculturing them in a liquid medium before collecting the cell-free supernatant (CFS). The spectrum of antibacterial activity was evaluated by agar well diffusion assay against various pathogenic bacteria, such as S. aureus TISTR 517 and MRSA strains 142, 1096, and 2468. Only four isolates from ZM agar exhibited antibacterial activity against different pathogens. It was observed that NNS4-5-2 isolate demonstrated antibacterial activity against MRSA but not against S. aureus. Nevertheless, three isolates (NNS2-1, NNS4-2, and NNS4-3) exhibited inhibitory effects against S. aureus TISTR 517, as well as MRSA strains 142, 1096, and 2468. Therefore, three isolates demonstrated antibacterial activity against both antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus. Notably, the NNS4-3 isolate exhibited the greatest diameter of inhibition zone against MRSA strains compared to the other isolates. Its antibacterial activity against three strains of MRSA was superior to cefoxitin and comparable to vancomycin (Table 1). Consequently, this investigation focused on the antibacterial components produced by the NNS4-3 isolate to explore the significant findings of its genome and the antimicrobial active compound. 2.2. Kinetics of Antibacterial Component Production of NNS4-3 The incubation of NNS4-3 was performed from 1 to 7 days and the growth curve was plotted by measuring the OD at 625 nm while the antibacterial activity was determined after collecting CFSs at each time interval. The maximum activity of CFSs derived from NNS4-3 was observed at 48 h with inhibition zones of 22.97 ± 0.58, 21.45 ± 0.78, and 21.87 ± 0.38 mm against MRSA strains 142, 1096, and 2468, respectively. The inhibitory effect against S. aureus TISTR 517 was at its maximum at 72 h with an inhibition zone of 11.97 ± 1.03 mm. However, a decrease in antibacterial activity against four strains of S. aureus was observed from 48 h to 144 h of cultivation. The antibacterial activity disappeared when the incubation reached 168 h. The antibacterial components produced by NNS4-3 exhibited no significant difference in antibacterial activity against all MRSA strains at all time intervals (Figure 1). However, the antibacterial activity against antibiotic-susceptible S. aureus was significantly lower than that against MRSA strains across all time intervals. 2.3. Purification of the Active Antibacterial Components The crude product of antimicrobial components in the CFS of NNS4-3 was purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation and reversed-phase chromatography (RPC). Each fraction obtained from the purification steps was tested for antibacterial activity against MRSA strain 2468 using the agar well diffusion method. The CFS exhibited antibacterial activity against the MRSA strain 2468. The active precipitate was obtained at 75% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The collected precipitate was dissolved and desalted by dialysis in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The dialysate was further purified by RPC to confirm its antibacterial activity. The active RPC fraction eluted with 50% buffer B exhibited intense absorbance at 214 nm, indicating the presence of peptides (Figure 2a). The purification efficacy and molecular weight of the active fractions were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A single active band in Lane 1 indicated the effective purification process while Lanes 2 and 3 from ammonium sulfate precipitation and CFS, respectively, showed partial purification (Figure 2b). The electrophoresed gel showed an intense coomassie-blue-stained band between 5 and 10 kDa when compared to the protein marker in Lane M. To locate the active protein band, the other half of the gel was overlaid with MRSA strain 2468 soft agar and the clear zones revealed a molecular weight between 5 and 10 kDa (Figure 2c). The characterization of the protein band demonstrated that the purification procedure effectively concentrated the target protein and excluded other proteins, as indicated by the darkening of the active band and fading of others. The purification procedure was evaluated using a purification data sheet and the results showed a 22.65-fold increase in purification power compared to the initial crude extract with a 9.76% yield of the active peptide (Table 2). 2.4. De Novo Amino Acid Sequence of the Purified AMP and Secondary Structure Determination The purified NNS4-3 AMP from RPC was collected and subsequently subjected to amino acid sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. The de novo algorithm was used to predict the amino acid sequence from b-ion fragmentation. The molecular weight of the sequenced peptide was 1241.6768 Da (single protonated molecule in mass spectrogram reported 1242.72400 Da). The AMP was composed of 10 amino acid residues and sequenced as Lys-Leu-Leu-Lys-Asp-Leu-Phe-His-Asp-Asn with an average local confidence (ALC) score of 76% (Figure 3a). The prediction of the physicochemical properties of the peptide was performed by ProtParam on the Expasy server. The results revealed that the peptide had a theoretical pI of 6.75. The peptide contained positively charged amino acids due to two lysines and negatively charged amino acids due to two aspartic acids. The total net charge was +0.25 at pH 7.4. The grand average of hydropathy (GRAVY) value of the peptide was −0.730, predicted by hydrophobic amino acids, which were leucine and phenylalanine, and hydrophilic amino acids, which were lysine, aspartic acid, histidine, and asparagine. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structure of the NNS4-3 AMP. The secondary structure of the AMP was studied when the AMP was dissolved in different solvents (purified water and 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate; SDS). Purified water was used as a solvent for studying the AMP secondary structure in its native conformation, whereas 50 mM SDS was used to form micelles for studying the interaction of the AMP, which simulates the negatively charged bacterial cell membrane environment [11]. The CD results showed a high positive band at 190–230 nm with a magnitude of 200 nm and a negative band at 205–240 nm with a magnitude of 220 nm in both solvent systems. The results indicated that alpha-helix and beta-sheet conformations were found in the structure of the NNS4-3 AMP. When comparing the use of purified water and 50 mM SDS as solvents, the results showed that the positive band at 190–230 nm decreased in magnitude, whereas the negative band at 205–240 nm increased in magnitude when the AMP was dissolved in SDS. The change in magnitude indicated a transformation in the AMP structure to an alpha-helix conformation when dissolved in the SDS solution (Figure 3b). The components of the AMP secondary structure were calculated using CD spectra by the BeStSel web-based service. Different components of structural conformation were found when using purified water and 50 mM SDS solution as solvents. The AMP dissolved in purified water revealed that the major component, the beta-sheet conformation with an antiparallel direction, accounted for 58.1% while the alpha-helix conformation was 4.2% and the random coil conformation was 37.7%. In contrast, when the AMP was dissolved in 50 mM SDS, the major component of structural conformation changed to 46.7% of the alpha-helix conformation, along with 10.1% of random coil conformation, while the beta-sheet with the antiparallel direction was reduced to 43.1% (Figure 3c). The component changes of AMP secondary structure when dissolved in 50 mM SDS suggested that the random coil conformation of the NNS4-3 AMP structure was converted to an alpha-helix conformation by the interaction of SDS micelles through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the AMP and the surface of SDS micelles. The amino acid arrangement of NNS4-3 AMP in an alpha-helix conformation was predicted by a helical wheel from the HELIQUEST web-based service. The predicted helical wheel showed three groups of amino acid arrangement, namely, positively charged, negatively charged, and hydrophobic areas (Figure 3d). For more visualization of the 3D molecular surface area of NNS4-3 AMP, the secondary structure was predicted by PEP-FOLD4. The predicted molecular model of NNS4-3 AMP showed a polar region localized around the N-terminus and C-terminus, indicated by blue (positive electrostatic potential) and red (negative electrostatic potential) colors, while the hydrophobic region indicated by grey color was in the middle of the structure (Figure 3e). The predicted 3D structure of NNS4-3 AMP was consistent with the helical wheel prediction. 2.5. Determination of the Antimicrobial Activity of NNS4-3 AMP by the Microdilution Method The microdilution method was performed to determine the antibacterial activity of the purified AMP of NNS4-3 compared to the standard antibiotics. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were different between antibiotic-susceptible strains and resistant strains. S. aureus TISTR 517 was inhibited by 16 µg/mL. This concentration was 16-fold higher than the MIC value for three resistant strains (MRSA strains 142, 1096, and 2468) at 1 µg/mL. NNS4-3 AMP required 4-fold the amount of the MIC to exhibit the bactericidal effect against all tested strains. Vancomycin exhibited an inhibitory effect with a killing action because the MIC and MBC were equal. In contrast, cefoxitin showed equal MIC against S. aureus TISTR 517 but it was ineffective against all resistant strains (Table 3). 2.6. Scanning Electron Microscopic Studies Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate the morphological alterations and membrane damage in S. aureus and MRSA caused by AMPs and standard antibiotics. After exposure to the NNS4-3 AMP, cell walls and cell membranes of pathogenic bacterial cells appeared to rupture and pore formation was observed (Figure 4, indicated by an arrow). The results indicated that the pathogens were sensitive to AMPs at 1× MIC at 18 h of incubation. S. aureus TISTR 517 showed cellular lysis when treated with cefoxitin, vancomycin, and NNS4-3 AMP. In the non-treatment condition, the cell membranes were intact with smooth surfaces and regular shapes. In contrast, MRSA strain 2468 showed good tolerance to cefoxitin treatment due to its resistant nature and that was similar to intact cell characteristics under non-treatment conditions. Vancomycin exhibited the potential to kill MRSA cells, as indicated by the irregular shape observed. The rupture of cell membranes indicated that the treated cells could not maintain their regular shape due to the interference with the D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety in cell wall synthesis by vancomycin. Interestingly, the antibacterial activity of NNS4-3 AMP resulted in the membrane disruption and pore formation that was indicated by the extrusion of the cytoplasm. The irregular shape of the treated cells and membrane damage, revealed by the rough surface of the cellular membrane, indicated the destabilization of cell membranes caused by AMPs. 2.7. Killing Kinetics of the AMP Isolated from NNS4-3 Time-kill kinetics is a crucial parameter for evaluating the efficacy and the mode of action of the AMP. The concentrations of NNS4-3 AMP at 1× MIC, 2× MIC, and 4× MIC were used to treat S. aureus TISTR 517 and MRSA strain 2468. A significant reduction in survival cells was observed at 4 h of treatment compared to the non-treatment condition in both strains. The antimicrobial effect at the concentration of 1× MIC and 2× MIC against S. aureus TISTR 517 caused the survival cells to initially decline at 4 h and survival cells continued to decrease until 8 h of treatment. After that, the survival cell numbers slightly increased but the number of survival cells remained lower than the initial count until 24 h. The findings indicated that even after 24 h, NNS4-3 AMP at 1× MIC and 2× MIC did not completely kill S. aureus TISTR 517. The time-kill curve showed a log reduction rate of the survival cells at 1× MIC and 2× MIC of 0.028 and 0.061 logCFU/h, respectively. However, at a concentration of 4× MIC, the AMP continuously killed S. aureus TISTR 517 with the highest log reduction rate of 0.339 logCFU/h. In addition, the concentration at 4× MIC completely eradicated S. aureus TISTR 517 at 16 h of treatment. NNS4-3 AMP showed stronger inhibition to MRSA strain 2468 compared to S. aureus TISTR 517. The log reduction rates of MRSA strain 2468 treated with the AMP at the concentrations of 1× MIC, 2× MIC, and 4× MIC were 0.115, 0.190, and 0.757 logCFU/h, respectively. Furthermore, the viable cells were completely eliminated within 8 h after treatment with 4× MIC of AMP (Figure 5). The different concentrations of NNS4-3 AMP between 1× MIC, 2× MIC, and 4× MIC revealed different reduction trends when the treatment time reached 16 h and 4 h against S. aureus TISTR 517 and MRSA strain 2468, respectively. The inhibitory concentrations were consistent with MIC and MBC determinations. The mode of action of AMP could be proposed in a concentration- and time-dependent manner against both pathogens. However, the time-killing curve provided information that wild-type and antibiotic-resistant strains were differently sensitive to the NNS4-3 AMP. 2.8. Stability Determination of NNS4-3 AMP under Various Conditions: Temperature, Proteolytic Enzymes, Surfactants, and Acid-Base Treatment The stability of the NNS4-3 AMP under various conditions is shown in Table 4. Thermal stability studies revealed that the antibacterial activity of the AMP against MRSA strain 2468 was maintained at 37 °C for up to 12 h. The AMP retained its antibacterial activity at 60 °C for up to 6 h of incubation, whereas a significant reduction was observed at 12 h. The activities decreased to half potency when the temperature was above 80 °C after 6 h and 12 h of incubation. The antibacterial activity of the AMP decreased to approximately 73% when treated at 100 °C for 1 h and the activity completely diminished to 0% over subsequent incubation periods. For more thermal-stressed conditions, autoclaving was performed. AMP activity was reduced to 61% after autoclaving for 15 min. The activity of the AMP completely disappeared after autoclaving for 30 min. The tolerance of the AMP to proteolytic enzymes showed that NNS4-3 AMP resisted three different proteolytic enzymes (proteinase K, trypsin, and α-chymotrypsin) for up to 12 h of incubation. The results showed that the overall activity of the AMP was more than 90%. Surfactants above the critical micelle concentration were used in the experiment as the interferences of AMP activity. SDS and Triton X-100 affected the AMP activity differently. SDS, the ionic surfactant, reduced the antibacterial activity of the AMP; however, the non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 did not affect the activity of the AMP. A decrease in AMP activity after treatment with surfactants did not depend on the incubation time. There was no significant difference in the activity of the AMP incubated at different physiological pHs, including pHs 1.2, 4.5, 6.8, and 7.4, when compared to the non-treated sample, which was the AMP dissolved in purified water. However, the activity of the AMP decreased with increasing incubation time. The stability studies of the AMP revealed that it was tolerant of different environmental factors, maintaining more than 90% activity. However, temperatures exceeding 80 °C or exposure to an ionic surfactant should be considered for assessing the robustness of its activity. 2.9. Phenotypic Characterization of NNS4-3 NNS4-3 displayed a single colony with a rough surface and filamentous border. After 2 days of culture, the colony began to produce red pigment (Figure 6a). Light microscope observations showed Gram-positive streptobacilli (Figure 6b) and the endospores were stained with malachite green after 3 days of culture (Figure 6c). The dimensions of a single cell were 0.33–0.56 µm in width and 2.44–2.57 µm in length. When cells were forming endospores, cellular dimensions reduced in length to 2.04–2.16 µm and the width increased to 0.63–0.78 µm. The spores exhibited a wrinkled morphology due to cell membrane shrinkage; therefore, the cell dimensions were reduced to be compact with a width of 0.48–0.58 µm and a length of 1.03–1.12 µm (Figure 6d). 2.10. Genome Insights for Coding Sequence Annotation and Genome-Based Phylogenetic Tree Construction The read quality was high and the assembled genome had a size of 4,264,659 bp by 693× sequencing depth that was constructed by de novo assembly using the SPAdes method. The information from genome construction showed that the genome contained 56 contigs, with an average contig length of 257,831 bp, and the GC content was 46%. The genome presented a completeness of 99.57%. No prophages or foreign DNA fragments were detected, indicating that the genome assembly was free from contamination. The genome sequence of Bacillus paralicheniformis NNS4-3 was deposited in the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database under the accession number JBDLPF010000000. The protein-coding sequences (CDSs) were annotated by Rapid Prokaryotic Genome Annotation (Prokka) version 1.14.6 including biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of secondary metabolites, which were annotated by Antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) version 7.0. The prediction of antimicrobial-resistant genes localized in the genome was annotated by the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD). The annotation systems were visualized by Proksee. The analyzed genome was presented with annotations by a circular map with a number of different functions of genes that were classified and expressed by various colors (Figure 7a). The 4288 genes were annotated by Prokka and there were 4195 CDSs, 12 rRNA, 1 tmRNA, and 80 tRNA in the genome. The BGCs of secondary metabolites as antimicrobial compounds were counted by antiSMASH, which provided 13 BGCs with different similarities based on orthologs in the databases. The Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) method was used to predict the cellular machinery of genome information. The genes were categorized into subsystem and non-subsystem classifications. Of the total 4526 coding sequences (CDSs), 28% were categorized into subsystems and 72% into non-subsystems. The encoding proteins annotated by subsystem functionalization were 1246 genes by which 1185 genes and 61 genes were encoded to non-hypothetical and hypothetical proteins, respectively. The subsystem category distribution found 1795 features. In contrast, 3280 genes annotated by familial genes evidenced in the database were non-subsystem. There were 1662 genes encoding non-hypothetical proteins and 1618 genes encoding hypothetical proteins (Figure 7b). The taxonomy of NNS4-3 was predicted by a genome-based sequence and analyzed by the service of the Type (Strain) Genome Server (TYGS). NNS4-3 had the closest relation to Bacillus paralicheniformis KJ-16. The pairwise comparison calculated by the Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny (GBDP) method against the genomes in the TYGS database showed a similarity score of 89.4% (95% CI, 86.1–92.0%), 73.8% (95% CI, 70.8–76.7%), and 89.5% (95% CI, 86.7–91.8%) as d0, d4, and d6, respectively (Figure 7c). One primary safety evaluation for using NNS4-3 in future healthcare products is antibiotic susceptibility, in compliance with FDA regulations. We investigated antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) using the prediction of the resistance gene identifier (RGI) in the CARD database (Table S1) and confirmed antibiotic susceptibility with the disk diffusion method (Figure S1). Our key findings include the presence of the fosBx1 gene, which suggests resistance to fosfomycin with moderate identity (55.56%) and coverage (111.59%) [12]. Four glycopeptide resistance genes (two of the vanT gene in the vanG cluster, the vanY gene in the vanG cluster, and the vanW gene in the vanI cluster) exhibited low identity (32.26–39.39%) and moderate–high coverage (54.78–97.85%) but vancomycin susceptibility was high, indicating these genes might have low-level expression or alternative functions [13]. The BcIII gene, a class-A beta-lactamase, showed moderate identity (64.40%) and high coverage (97.15%), leading to ceftriaxone resistance while being inhibited by cefoxitin [14]. The qacJ gene, conferring resistance to disinfectants via an efflux pump, had low identity (42.00%) and high coverage (98.13%). Additionally, genes bcrA, bcrB, and bcrC, related to bacitracin resistance, exhibited high identity (98.69–99.52%) and coverage (100.00–107.84%), consistent with the production of a bacitracin-like peptide [15,16,17]. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed the highest susceptibility to erythromycin, with high potency inhibition by ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem. Cefoxitin, gentamicin, doxycycline, and vancomycin showed moderate to high susceptibility, while the isolate tolerated ceftriaxone at normal doses (Figure S1). These results suggest that NNS4-3 is susceptible to commonly used antibiotics in both community and hospital settings. 2.11. Comparison of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters of NNS4-3 The BGCs were predicted by genome information analysis using the antiSMASH platform. The sub-platform of antiSMASH, Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG), predicted 13 gene clusters, which were annotated and reported by similar orthologs. The biosynthetic gene cluster comparison was determined. It was found that the analyzed genome contained three clusters of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), six clusters of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), one cluster of polyketides (PKs), and three clusters of others. Ten predicted BGCs of the NNS4-3 genome were matched with the known gene clusters in the database. Each gene showed different similarities. The highest similarity score indicated 100% similarity to BGCs of lasso peptide, bacillibactin, lichenysin, and bacitracin. The moderate similarity ranged from 33 to 75%, showing the BGCs of shizokinen, pulcherriminic acid, and fengycin. The lowest similarity annotated as others cluster was 7% to BGCs of butirosin (Figure 8). Predicting the BGCs using similar orthologs provided insights into exploring the genome and determining the gene products of various secondary metabolites. The purified AMP of NNS4-3, which was determined the amino acid sequence using mass spectrometry (Lys-Leu-Leu-Lys-Asp-Leu-Phe-His-Asp-Asn), showed a sequence relevant to the amino acid sequence of bacitracin (Leu-Cys-Leu-Glu-Ile-Lys-Orn-Ile-Phe-His-Asp-Asn). AntiSMASH results showed that the gene cluster ortholog was 100% similar to the bacitracin BGC (BGC0000310) in the MIBiG database (Figure 9a). This reference gene cluster belonged to Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 10716 (NCBI GenBank: AF007865.2). The encoded amino acid sequences of genes in the predicted bacitracin-like BGC were compared to the bacitracin BGC in the database by pairwise alignment. Differences in encoded amino acids between each gene within the BGC were found. Bacitracin is an AMP constructed by non-ribosomal peptide synthesis via orchestrated enzymes. There were bacT, bacA, bacB, bacC, bacR, bacS, bcrA, bcrB, and bcrC coding sequences responsible for bacitracin synthesis that matched with 82.32–99.52% identity and 97.9–100% coverage of the query amino acid sequence of the NNS4-3 genome (Figure 9b). Interestingly, the core biosynthetic genes, including bacA, bacB, and bacC, which encoded the principal enzymes for bacitracin production, showed amino acid sequence identities with the NNS4-3 coding region of 96.39%, 95.24%, and 96.64%, respectively. Both AMPs shared a conserved amino acid sequence of Ile-Lys-Orn-Ile-Phe-His-Asp-Asn. This finding supported the relevance of the amino acid sequence of NNS4-3 AMP to the amino acid sequence of bacitracin. However, the limitation of mass spectrometry is its inability to distinguish between isoleucine (Ile) and leucine (Leu), which have the same molecular weight.
