3. Results 3.1. Size and Gene Position of the scr3559 Transcript The scr3559 RNA (also called Sc2 in [15] or 6S RNA in [16]) is a 192 nt long transcript that folds into a 6S-like secondary structure [16]. Its gene is located between SCO3558 and SCO3559. It is noteworthy that it is oriented downstream of SCO3559, as illustrated here in Figure 1 (minus strand) and is in accordance with the RNA sequence shown in both the above-mentioned publications, although the gene is mistakenly depicted in the opposite direction in Mikul√≠k et al. [16], where it is dubbed ssrS. To precisely map the scr3559 transcription start site, a RACE experiment was performed using internal nested primers complementary to the scr3559 RNA. Two RT-PCR products were detected and sequenced (Figure 2). These corresponded to a nascent (pre-scr3559 RNA) and a processed transcript (scr3559 RNA) of sizes 260 and 192 bases, respectively. The transcription start site is thus located at genome position 3934888, whereas the processed 6S-like form, as presented previously, begins at position 3934820. Based on these results, secondary structures of precursor (pre-scr3559 RNA), processed (scr3559 RNA) and excised transcripts were modeled using the RNAfold algorithm (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi, accessed on 1 September 2021) [29] (Figure 2b). 3.2. scr3559 RNA Expression Profiles (Northern Blotting) scr3559 RNA levels were monitored throughout development for both the control C0 strain and the mutant C6S strain. Cells were cultivated in liquid NMMP medium and harvested after 12 h (early exponential phase of growth), 48 h (late exponential phase of growth) and 72 h of cultivation (stationary phase). No signal was detected in samples from the early exponential phase (not shown). A signal corresponding with pre-scr3559 RNA (260 nt) was detected only in the older cells of the C0 strain, whereas it is clearly seen in both developmental time points in the C6S over-expression strain (Figure 3). In both strains, the processed scr3559 RNA could only be detected during the exponential to stationary phase transition, when 6S RNA is expected to be active. 3.3. Phenotypic Analyses After cultivation in NMMP medium with the selective antibiotic thiostrepton, the production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin metabolites were measured and normalized per cell concentration. The dry weight of the cells was estimated after they were collected in spin columns (Qiagen), centrifuged and washed with ethanol. Elevated antibiotic production, actinorhodin (blue) and undecylprodigiosin (red) were repeatedly detected in the C6S overexpression strain, compared with the C0 control strain (Figure 4). When cultivated on solid agar plates containing thiostrepton (R2YE, SMMS, MS), the C6S strains revealed differences in morphology (small colonies, aberrant mycelium formation, less biomass, and more rapid sporulation compared to the C0 control), and exhibited increased production of secondary metabolites (mainly blue actinorhodin) (Figure 5a). This observation was supported by the data collected using electron microscopy to compare the morphology of C6S and C0 control strains grown in the presence of thiostrepton. The pictures clearly show the accelerated development of the aerial mycelium for the C6S strain (Figure 5b). When cultivated on solid MS plates with apramycin and a gradient of thiostrepton, actinorhodin was visibly over-produced by the C6S strain only in the areas with higher concentrations of thiostrepton. In this area, growth of the C6S strain was slower, its cell density was lower and colonies were tiny and grey, suggesting that vegetative growth may be suppressed, and sporulation may be accelerated. Growth in the area that did not contain thiostrepton (i.e., the tipA promoter is not induced and scr3559 is not overexpressed) looked similar to that of the C0 control strain, which did not show any phenotypic differences on the same thiostrepton gradient on MS medium. When cultivated on ONA medium with an equivalent thiostrepton gradient, the C6S strain produced visibly more actinorhodin throughout the entire plate. Only in the area with the highest thiostrepton concentrations, actinorhodin was overproduced in both strains. (Figure 6). This supports our assertion that overexpressing scr3559 (in response to thiostrepton induction) leads to profound phenotypic changes. 3.4. LC-MS Analysis of Other Metabolite Production After both C6S and C0 strains had been cultivated for 48 h in R3 liquid medium, supernatants were subjected to LC-MS analysis. No qualitative changes were observed in the production of secondary metabolites, but quantitative differences were detected. Besides the already described increased production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin, other metabolites were detected in both strains. These include germicidins (A, B), desferrioxamines (B, E, G1), and coelimycin P1. 3.4.1. Germicidins The LC-MS data qualitatively confirmed the presence of germicidin A (tR = 6.48 min) and germicidin B (tR = 5.91 min). The acquired m/z 197.1193 corresponded to the [M + H]+ of germicidin A with a theoretical m/z 197.1178. Based on a comparison of the area under the curve (AUC), six times higher production of germicidin A was observed in C6S (AUCC6S = 1252) compared with the C0 strain (AUCC0 = 206) (Figure 7). Germicidin B was also produced at higher levels in the C6S strain as well, although its levels were not as strikingly enhanced relative to that of germicidin A (AUCC6S = 336 and AUCC0 = 90). The acquired m/z 183.1031 corresponded to the [M + H]+ of germicidin B with a theoretical m/z 183.1021. 3.4.2. Desferrioxaomines Desferrioxamine B was detected at tR = 3.14 min. The acquired m/z 561.3614 corresponded to the [M + H]+ of desferrioxamine B with a theoretical m/z 561.3625. The production of this metabolite during the cultivation in R3 with glucose was higher in C6S (AUCC6S = 173) than in C0 (AUCC0 = 110) (Figure 8). A similar trend was seen for the production of desferrioxamine E (AUCC6S = 208 vs. AUCC0 = 139) and G1 (AUCC6S = 34 vs. AUCC0 = 21). Desferrioxamine E was detected at tR = 4.72 min. The acquired m/z 601.3546 corresponded to the [M + H]+ of desferrioxamine E with a theoretical m/z 601.3561. Desferrioxamine G1 was also detected (tR = 3.28; m/z 619.3663), although the differences between the C6S and C0 strains were subtle. 3.4.3. Coelimycin P1 We also confirmed the presence of coelimycin P1 (tR = 7.48), an unusual polyketide alkaloid produced by S. coelicolor [30]. The acquired m/z 349.1222 corresponded to the [M + H]+ of coelimycin P1 with a theoretical m/z 349.1229. Traces of this substance were detected when culturing both strains in R3 liquid medium with glucose (AUCC6S = 21 vs. AUCC0 = 8) (Figure 9). However, when we used glycerol instead of glucose as an energy source in the R3 cultivation medium, the production of coelimycin was apparent only in the C6S strain (AUCC6S = 139). 3.5. Microarray Transcriptional Analysis Microarray analysis was performed on C0 and C6S cells grown in liquid NMMP medium. Since previous expression analysis had shown higher levels of scr3559 RNA at later stages of growth, two stages of cell development were investigated: 72 h (younger cells), corresponding to early stationary phase (transition from exponential growth phase, when antibiotic production typically initiates) and 144 h (older cells), corresponding to late stationary stage. Genes that exhibited differential changes in expression are summarized in Table 2 and discussed below.
