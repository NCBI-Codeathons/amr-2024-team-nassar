Results Identification of a novel MPA producer P. arizonense Among thirty-six fungal strains isolated from different types of refrigerated cheeses, an MPA producer strain showing high similarity with P. arizonense was selected in this study as a new producer strain for MPA. Morphological identification indicated that this species belongs to section Canescentia, and molecular analysis of the ITS region confirmed its close relation to P. arizonense. Phylogenetic computation according to marker genes proved the grouping of this strain within section Canescentia(Fig. 1a), and approximately 98.5–99% similarity was detected with other related strains of P. arizonense deposited in the GenBank database. The high similarity of ITS region of our isolate confirmed its morphological identification. Based on both morphological and molecular analyses, the isolated strain was named P. arizonense HE-MAwt, and its ITS sequence was submitted to the GenBank database under the accession number MT355884. The wild-type strain was identified using an additional molecular marker benA gene and the retrieved sequence was deposited at the GenBank under the accession number ON208859. The phylogenetic analysis according to the benA marker gene proved the close relation of our strain to P. arizonense strains deposited at GenBank database and confirmed the molecular identification using ITS marker which deposited our isolate within section Canescentia(Fig. 1b).

The produced compound was initially identified by TLC and then quantified by HPLC analysis compared to the authentic compound. The results presented in Fig. 2a indicated the presence of blue fluorescence spots after exposure of the TLC plate to ammonium vapor in front of the authentic standard compound. The Rf value of the standard solution was equal to the compound separated by our organism. The quantitative determination of MPA produced by wild-type and mutant strains of P. arizonense was performed by HPLC analysis, as shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S. (1), respectively. Identification of MPA biosynthetic genes in P. arizonense Conventional PCR analysis PCR analysis showed that the 5 MPA genes, mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG, and mapH, gave strong amplification in both wild-type and mutant strains as shown in Fig. S. (2). For more confirmation of the presence of these genes in our isolate and to study the similarity percentage with their orthologous genes in P. brevicompactum and their homologous genes in P. arizonense strain CBS 141,311, the amplicons resulting from cDNA amplification of the MPA genes (Fig. S. 3) were sequenced in the forward and reverse directions using the designed primers listed in Table S. (1). The obtained sequences of all amplified genes were aligned against the more related genes deposited in the GenBank database using multiple sequence alignment search tools. The blast alignment and bioinformatic analysis of the MPA genes revealed that all retrieved gene sequences showed 96–97% similarity to the related protein-coding genes of P. arizonense submitted in the GenBank database and 82–96% similarity to the orthologous genes of MPA biosynthesizing gene clusters of both P. brevicopmactum and P. roquefourti (Table 1). The retrieved sequences of the amplified genes, mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG, and mapH in P. arizonense HE-MPwt were registered in the GenBank database under the accession numbers MT786725, MT786724, MT786723, MT786726, and MT797806, respectively (Table S.2). A proposed map of the MPA genes predicted from P. arizonense genome and the map of the MPA gene cluster in P. brevicompactum (HQ731031.1), retrieved from the MIBiG database (public domain), is represented in Fig. 3. The diagram shows two contige containing five genes in the P. arizonense genome that could be responsible for MPA biosynthesis in P. arizonense. Bioinformatic analysis of these genes confirmed their close relation to the orthologous genes in both P. brevicompactum and P. roqueforti. All genes were more related to the homologous genes in P. arizonense registered in the GenBank database. The amino acid sequences of the putative proteins also showed high similarity with other orthologous proteins of MPA in both P. brevicompactum and P. roqueforti (Fig. S. 4), and their conserved regions present in other homologous strains were detected in Fig.(4).

Overproduction of MPA by mutagenesis of P. arizonense and mutants’ selection Three mutant strains of P. arizonense, namely, HE-MPM1, HE-MPM2, and HE-MPM3, were selected as stable overproducer mutants to produce MPA. The initial selection was based on a phenotypic variation of the growing colonies and on the production of MPA in the culture media. The phenotypic characterization of the wild-type and mutant strains proceeded with morphological and microscopic studies after their growth on the PDA culture medium. The phenotypic variation between the mutant and the wild-type strains was summarized in Table S. (3 & 4). It was observed that the mutant strains varied in their growth rate, colony size, and texture of hyphae compared to the wild-type strain as detected in Fig. S. (5 &6) and Table S. (3). There was no change in the color of the metabolite of the wild-type strain, MT1, and MT2 mutant after 5d of incubation on a PDA culture medium, whereas the MT1 and MT2 changed to pale yellow and brownish yellow, respectively after 10 d of incubation. A yellow-colored soluble exudate appeared in the fungal filtrate of MT2 mutant after 5 d of incubation on PD broth and solid culture, which was converted to dark brown after 10 d of incubation. Additionally, small watery droplets, large irregular watery droplets, and yellow condensed irregular exudates appeared on the mycelial growth of wild type, MT1, and MT2 strains, respectively (Fig. S.5). The microscopic characteristics presented in Table S. (4) described that there were no significant variations in the shape and diameter of conidia and phialide of the mutants compared to the wild-type strain. There were no significant differences in the mycelial growth on PD broth culture for wild-type and mutant strains. The mutants HE-MPM1, HE-MPM2, and HE-MPM3 were identified by molecular analysis of the ITS region, and the retrieved sequences were deposited at the GenBank database under the accession numbers MT355885, MT355886, MT355887, respectively. Sequencing analysis showed their high similarity to P. arizonense species deposited in the GenBank database and confirmed the previous identification of our wild-type strain. The production of MPA was estimated after each incubation time for four respective generations, as shown in Table S. (5). The results indicated that the selected three mutants maintained the high production of MPA after subculture for 4 generations without significant changes. The MPA amounts produced by MT1, MT2, and MT3 were 11.82 ± 0.174, 9.231 ± 0.178, and 8.79 ± 0.168 µg mL− 1, respectively, while the amount produced by the wild-type strain was 5.457 ± 0.174 µg mL− 1. These results indicated that MPA production by MT1, MT2, and MT3 was increased by 2.1, 1.7, and 1.6-fold, respectively, compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 5).

Optimization of fermentation conditions To reach the highest amounts of MPA by our experimental strains, the upstream processing conditions of the production of MPA and fungal growth (Fig. 6 A,B) by WT and MT strains of P. arizonense were optimized. PD broth medium was the best culture medium for maximum production of MPA by wild-type HE-MPWt and mutant strain HE-MPM1 of P. arizonense (5.97449 ± 0.12 and 12.026 ± 0.122 µg mL− 1, respectively), whereas MES broth medium was the best culture medium for mycelial dry weight of both wild-type and mutant strains (14.22 ± 0.33 and 13.52.000 ± 0.24 mg mL− 1 culture medium, respectively) as shown in Fig. (6a). It was noticed that the mycelial dry cell weights significantly decreased in the mutant strain compared to the wild-type strain. Optimizing the fermentation conditions was extended to investigate the optimum incubation time for mycelial growth and MPA production. The obtained results from Fig. (6b) revealed that MPA appeared in the culture filtrate of both the HE-MPWt and the HE-MPM1 strains of P. arizonense after 5 days of incubation (3.441 ± 0.943 and 5.775 ± 0.252 µg mL− 1, respectively), and then it was increased by increasing the incubation time until reaching its maximum value (9.032 ± 0.12 and 17.99 ± 0.094 µg mL− 1) after 15 days of incubation. On the other hand, the maximum growth of both wild type and mutant strains was observed after 10 d of incubation (Fig. 6b). The growth and the production of MPA by the two experimental strains were also greatly affected by the initial pH value of the culture medium (Fig. 6c). The results showed that MPA production by P. arizonense HE-MPWt and P. arizonense HE-MPM1 increased gradually by increasing the pH value of the culture medium, reaching maximum values (9.0 ± 0.27 and 17.98 ± 0.285 µg mL− 1, respectively) at pH 6 after 15 days of incubation at 25 °C. It was noticed that the ranges of pH values suitable for mycelial growth ranged from 5 to 8 while the maximum growth of both wild type and mutant strains was observed at pH value 5 (7.50 ± 1.20 and 7.31 ± 1.57 mg mL− 1 culture medium, respectively). After incubation of both the wild-type and mutant strains at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C for 10 days, the optimum incubation temperature for optimum production of MPA by both P. arizonense HE-MPWt and P. arizonense HE-MPM1 strains (5.974 ± 0.31 and 12.1 ± 0.2404 µg mL− 1, respectively) and for maximum mycelial growth (6.16 ± 0.42and 5.28 ± 0.29 mg mL− 1 culture medium, respectively) was recorded at 25 °C (Fig. 6d). Although well growth of both mutants and wild type was observed at 10 °C, all strains failed to produce MPA at this temperature. These results indicate that the growth of all experimental strains on PD broth adjusted to pH 6 and incubated at 25 °C for 15 d were favorable for MPA production. In general, there were significant differences in MPA production by the wild-type and all mutant strains under all tested environmental conditions according to independent samples t-tests (P ≤ 0.05). Additionally, there was no relation between the mycelial growth and the MPA production in most of the tested conditions. The optimal environmental conditions of the three selected mutants were identical in all experiments. Therefore, the highest producer mutant, MT1, was represented in this study as a model mutant in comparison with the wild-type strain.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription (qRT-PCR) analysis of MPA biosynthetic genes in P. arizonense The qRT-PCR results were analyzed with iQ 5 optical system software (Bio-Rad) using the PCR baseline subtracted mode. The threshold cycle was calculated for all samples, and the amplification efficiency for each gene amplified from P. arizonense (WT and MT strains) was determined. The threshold cycle of all genes, in addition to the housekeeping gene (β -actin gene), of P. arizonense (WT strain HE-MPwt and mutant strains MT1, MT2, and MT3) after 5 d and 10 d of incubation time are shown in Table S. (6) and Fig. (7). The wild-type strain was used as endogenous control, and the β-actin gene was used for normalization as control of constant expression. Table S. (6) shows the expression of the MPA genes, mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH in MPA over producer mutant strains after 5 and 10 days of incubation. The obtained results recorded a significant increase in the expression of all analyzed mycophenolic acid genes in the three tested mycophenolic acids producer mutants over the wild-type strain of P. arizonense. It was observed that the transcription value of these genes in mutant strain MT3 was the highest compared to the other mutant strains. The transcription values of mpaA, mpaC, mpaF, mpaG, and mpaH in mutant strain MT1 were1.6, 2.0, 3.1, 2.6 and 1.99 after 5 days, and 1.5, 8.5, 5.7, 3.1, and 4.6-fold higher than those in the wild-type strain after 10 d of incubation, respectively. It was observed that the gene expression of mpaC, mpaF, mpaH, and mpaG was significantly increased according to the incubation time, and these increments corresponded to the production of MPA, where its amount doubled after 10 d of incubation. The expression values of mpaC and mpaF were significantly higher than those of the other genes according to t-test analysis, where the p-value was lower than 0.05. The expression values of mpaC and mpaF were the highest in all mutants, followed by mpaH and mpaG, whereas the expression value of mpaA was the lowest at all. It was also noticed that the expression of the MPA genes in the mutant strain MT1 was higher than that of MT2 and MT3 after 5 and 10 days of incubation. The expression of the identified genes was correlated with the production of MPA, where the mutant strain MT1 was the highest producer strain for MPA and the production of MPA significantly increased after 10 days of incubation. The recorded results confirmed the potential roles of the five genes mpaA, mpaC, mpaG, mpaF, and mpaH in the biosynthesis process of MPA in P. arizonense.
