Results APV production The P. agglomerans strains Pa48b and 39b/90 (Pa39b) have been previously shown to produce APV (Sammer et al. 2009). In order to define their APV production profile, both strains were grown in liquid culture at 10, 18, and 28°C, respectively. The amounts of APV produced by both strains were quantified by agar diffusion assays using E. amylovora as an indicator strain. Sterile culture supernatants of Pantoea strains were added, and inhibition zones were read after 24 h of incubation. Both Pa39b and Pa48b showed their maximal APV production at 10°C. The APV concentration of Pa39b (approximately 72 μg/mL) was six times lower than that produced by Pa48b (approximately 418 μg/mL). Pa39b inhibition zones in agar diffusion assays were absent at higher incubation temperatures (18 and 28°C) which correlates to the complete loss of APV production at both temperatures. Residual antibiotic activity (approximately 38 μg/mL) was detected in Pa48b at 18°C. In addition to the experiments described above, we supplemented the standard agar diffusion assays with the addition of the APV inhibitor N-acetylglucosamine (50 μL of a 100 μg/μL solution) per hole. The resulting complete disappearance of the inhibition zones caused by sterile culture supernatants of Pa48b and Pa39b grown at 10°C indicates that both strains produced only one antibiotic which is active against both E. amylovora and Psg. Characterization of APV biosynthesis cluster by transposon mutagenesis Mini-Tn5 mutants generated according to Larsen et al. (2002) were screened for altered APV production. Eight APV-negative mutants of Pa48b were selected for their inability to inhibit E. amylovora in the agar diffusion assay. The respective transposon insertion sites were subcloned by plasposon rescue cloning and the flanking regions were sequenced. Insertion sites clustered in a potential biosynthetic operon. Gap-closure of the APV biosynthesis cluster in Pa48b was done by SEFA-PCR (Wang et al. 2009). Sequences were analyzed using Blastx algorithm against the NCBI database (nonredundant protein sequences) (Altschul et al. 1997). Homologies and putative function of affected genes are listed in supplementary (Table S1). Comparison with the NCBI database showed high homology to a gene cluster of unknown function in Serratia proteamaculans 568 and to the recently annotated herbicolin I operon in P. vagans C9-1, respectively (Kamber et al. 2012). In P. agglomerans CU0119, an annotation for dapdiamide antibiotic (DAP) biosynthesis cluster was found. The DAP biosynthesis gene cluster was heterologously expressed in E. coli by Dawlaty et al. (2010) and yielded five 2,3-diaminopropionate-containing antibiotics whereas Pa48b produced only APV, which is very similar to dapdiamide A and E (DAP A, DAP E) (Sammer et al. 2009; Hollenhorst et al. 2010). Alignments of the APV biosynthesis gene cluster revealed 80.7% sequence identity to the S. proteamaculans 568 gene cluster, 95% sequence identity to the P. vagans C9-1 gene cluster (Kamber et al. 2012), and 99% sequence identity to the DAP biosynthesis cluster from CU0119 (Hollenhorst et al. 2009). Further in silico analysis of potential open reading frames with Vector NTI 9.0 (Invitrogen) identified overlaps of genes apvA and apvB in 8 base pairs and in genes apvC and apvD of 14 base pairs (Fig. 1).

Numbers below the clusters indicate gene identities to the APV biosynthesis cluster in Pa48b (in %). One APV-negative mutant (Pa48b-C1) was used to study the function of APV. Pa48b-C1 has a transposon insertion in apvB coding for an ornithine cyclodeaminase, which in combination with a cysteine synthase (encoded by apvA) is needed for the formation of toxic l-2,3-diaminopropionate. The latter is a precursor for several antibiotics, including Zwittermicin A, DAPs, and APV (Zhao et al. 2008; Hollenhorst et al. 2010). The stability of the transposon insertion in Pa48b-C1 during plant experiments was verified by the reisolation of mutants which were tested in agar diffusion assays (Fig. 2).

Biological control efficacy of Pa48b, Pa48b-C1, and Pa39b against bacterial plant pathogens Infection of host plants with fire blight happens by colonization of blossoms with E. amylovora. In laboratory experiments, fresh apple blossoms were inoculated with E. amylovora at 5 × 103 cfu/blossom. After 5 days of incubation at 18°C infected blossoms showed typical disease symptoms. Erwinia amylovora was reisolated and the population density was determined to be 108–1010 cfu/blossom. Both Pa48b and the APV-negative mutant Pa48b-C1 colonized apple blossoms and formed stable population densities of about 105–106 cfu/blossom in single inoculation experiments (Fig. 3B). In coinoculation experiments using E. amylovora, the population densities of Pa48b and Pa48b-C1 were higher (107–108 cfu/blossom) and the population density of E. amylovora was reduced by four to six orders of magnitude (Fig. 3A) compared with its single inoculation. Higher median population density values for E. amylovora in coinoculation with Pa48b-C1 (approximately 105 cfu/blossom), compared with the coinoculation with Pa48b (approximately 103 cfu/blossom), indicate an influence of APV in the antagonistic interaction. The incubation conditions in additional apple blossom experiments were adapted to a day–night cycle in order to evaluate whether these conditions lead to an increased influence of APV. Lower temperatures (about 16°C) at night were chosen to increase APV production which has been shown previously to be produced in a temperature-dependent manner in vitro (Sammer et al. 2009). Moderate temperatures (about 24°C) during the day support a fast colonization of apple blossoms. Despite the use of these adapted temperature conditions, the detected pathogen and antagonist populations were equivalent to those of constant temperature conditions (data not shown). Visual examination of the apple blossoms revealed that blossoms which were coinoculated with Pa48b or Pa48b-C1 remained symptom free by 5 days after inoculation.

Differences in the biocontrol efficiency of Pa48b, Pa48b-C1, and Pa39b against E. amylovora were evaluated by immature pear slice assays, which is well established for E. amylovora infection experiments (Bereswill and Geider 1997; Bogdanove et al. 1998; Zhao et al. 2005). Two E. amylovora strains which differ in their virulence (Ea7 and Ea1/79) were used in this bioassay. Immature pears were sliced and washed in suspensions of Pa48b, Pa48b-C1, and Pa39b, respectively. Afterward, an E. amylovora suspension was dropped onto the slices. After 6 days of incubation, symptom development was evaluated. No significant differences in the antagonistic activity of Pa48b and the APV-negative mutant Pa48b-C1 were observed (P < 0.05; data not shown). Thirty-five percent of the slices treated with Pa48b suspension and inoculated with the highly virulent pathogen strain Ea1/79 (5 × 102 cfu/slice) developed disease symptoms, whereas only 15% of slices treated with Pa39b suspension showed necrosis. Inoculation with the low-virulent strain Ea7 (5 × 103 cfu/slice) caused symptom development on 30% of the slices inoculated with Pa48b, whereas no symptoms were observed on Pa39b-inoculated pear slices. Under the tested conditions, Pa39b showed a significantly higher antagonistic activity against E. amylovora than either Pa48b or Pa48b-C1 (P < 0.05; data not shown). Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea (Psg) inoculation on soybean by prick-technique was used as additional plant model system in order to investigate the influence of APV. Soybean plants were cultivated under moderate (20–26°C) and low (12–20°C) temperature conditions and evaluated for disease formation in single and coinoculation experiments. The control inoculation with Psg caused typical chlorotic halos under both temperature conditions, whereas in coinoculation with Pa48b or Pa48b-C1, no chlorotic symptom formation was observed. Under moderate temperature conditions in single inoculation, the pathogen population reached about 107 cfu/wound. The coinoculation of Psg with Pa48b or its APV-negative mutant Pa48b-C1 leads to a decrease of the pathogen population by two orders of magnitude at 20–26°C compared with the growth of the pathogen alone (Fig. 4A). Similar growth and population numbers of Pa48b and Pa48b-C1 were observed at 12–20°C and 20–26°C (Fig. 4B). At 12–20°C, the initial pathogen density was increased by one order of magnitude to 5 × 104 cfu/wound in order to adjust for fast elimination of the pathogen by Pa48b or Pa48b-C1. This was due to the nonoptimal temperature conditions for growth of Psg. The resulting ratio was therefore 1:2 instead of 5:1 (antagonist:pathogen). Under these conditions, the high initial pathogen population allowed the pathogen to establish and spread faster compared with the lower initial pathogen populations at 20–26°C. However, Pa48b and Pa48b-C1 were able to significantly suppress Psg population by one order of magnitude at 12–20°C (P < 0.05; data not shown). In coinoculation experiments conducted at both 12–20°C and 20–26°C, Pa48b and Pa48b-C1 reached about 10-fold higher population sizes than occurred in single inoculations (Fig. 4B). Soybean infection experiments revealed no significant difference between Pa48b and its APV-negative mutant Pa48b-C1, at either 12–20°C or 20–26°C. Furthermore, Pa48b and Pa39b showed no differences in their biocontrol efficancy against the pathogen Psg or their epiphytic fitness (Fig. 4).

In order to test for a growth inhibiting effect of APV on the pathogen population associated with soybean leaves, Psg-infected wounds were treated with purified APV. The antibiotic APV was applied at different concentrations 3 days after Psg inoculation and was added again 3 and 7 days later. The population sizes of Psg were determined on days 3, 7, 11, and 20 after inoculation. The direct application of either 0.7 or 7 μg APV per wound had only a minor effect on the growth of the pathogen, whereas application of 20 μg APV per wound resulted in a decrease of the pathogen population by about three orders of magnitude (Fig. 5). That effect was likely caused by severe damage of the leaf tissue surrounding the wounds, and was characterized by a dry parchment-like structure (Fig. 6). It is likely that the elimination of habitat and basic nutrient resources are the reasons for the decrease of the pathogen population. Figure 5The pathogen populations after application of different amounts of purified APV (0.7, 7.0, 20.0 μg/wound, repeated three times: on day 3, 6, and 10) 20 days after Psg inoculation; values marked with the same letter did not differ significantly (P < 0.05; n = 3).
