Results Genome assembly and annotation A summary of the genome assemblies and annotations are listed in Table 2. The genome assemblies of the S isolates ranged in size from 38.1 Mb – 38.3 Mb (N50 values of 0.86 Mb – 1.14 Mb), and those of the L isolates ranged in size from 37 Mb – 37.5 Mb (N50 values of 0.93 Mb – 1.03 Mb). The predicted number of genes ranged from 13,368 – 13,374 for the S morphotype genomes, and 13,256 – 13,292 for L morphotype genomes. On average, the S morphotype genomes were larger by 1 Mb and contained 99 more genes. These assemblies are similar in size and in gene numbers to the previously sequenced genomes of A. flavus NRRL3357 (L morphotype; Nierman et al., 2015) and A. oryzae RIB40 (Machida et al., 2005) that are both 37 Mb in size with 13,485 predicted genes and 12,074 predicted genes, respectively. Predicted repetitive DNA content was slightly higher in the S morphotype genomes ranging from 1.7–1.86% relative to the L morphotype genomes that ranged from 1.29 – 1.49%. These values are considered to be an underestimate of the actual repetitive DNA content because repetitive regions do not assemble well from short sequence reads.

Structural variations between morphotypes Synteny analysis revealed an inversion on chromosome 8 between the S and L morphotype genomes that is ≈531 kB and ≈551 kB in the L morphotype and S morphotype genomes respectively (Figures 2 and S1). Using AZS and DV901 to represent the S and L morphotype genomes respectively, the inversion contained 213 genes in AZS and 208 genes in DV901. Most genes in the inversion had orthologs between AZS and DV901, except for three genes that were identified as S morphotype-unique proteins (morphotype-unique protein results are presented below); one that was identified as an L morphotype-unique protein, and one that was present in S isolates in a region deleted in the L morphotype genomes but that was not detected in the morphotype-unique protein analysis. In the S morphotype genomes, the borders of the inversion affect two secondary metabolite gene clusters, one on each end. The inversion starts at the end of a polyketide synthase (PKS) gene (gene c and inversion breakpoint A in Figure 2) and ends at the end of another PKS gene (gene l and inversion breakpoint B in Figure 2). In the L morphotype genomes, the inversion starts at a PKS gene that is a fused product of the two PKS genes that are at the margins of the inversion in the S morphotype genomes (gene c’ + l’ and inversion breakpoint C in Figure 2), and ends within a cutinase gene that is not encoded in the S morphotype genomes (gene p and inversion breakpoint D in Figure 2). An exception to this occurs in the DV901 genome, where the cutinase gene was not predicted due to a SNP that resulted in a premature stop codon. The presence of the inversion was confirmed by PCR using the primers depicted at each inversion breakpoint in Figure 2 and listed in Table 1. Primer pairs used to detect inversion breakpoints A and B (Figure 2) only yielded amplicons in the S morphotype isolates and primer pairs used to detect inversion breakpoints C and D only yielded amplicons in the L morphotype isolates (data not shown). Figure 2A schematic diagram of the chromosomal inversion on chromosome 8 using genomes of AZS and DV901 to represent the S and L morphotype, respectively. Genes in the vicinity of the inversion breakpoints are shown and regions of the inversion are indicated with gray bars; inversion breakpoints are designated as A, B, C, and D to match the in-text description. Genes located at the inversion breakpoints are shaded darker than the other genes. Arrows indicate the locations of PCR primers listed in Table 1. Orthologs between the two morphotypes are designated with the same lower case alphabet (a – o). At the inversion breakpoints in the L morphotype, gene c’+l’ represents a PKS gene that is a fused product of the two PKS genes (genes c and l) that are at the margins of the inversion in the S morphotype genomes, and gene p is a cutinase gene that is not encoded in the S morphotype.

In addition to synteny analysis, DELLY (Rausch et al., 2012) revealed 31 deletions that are common to the S morphotype genomes relative to the L morphotype ranging in size from 307 bp – 12,939 bp, three of which were larger than 5kb. Manual inspection of deletions larger than 5kb revealed that the largest deletion was also present in L isolate MC04, and thus was removed from consideration. For the L morphotype genomes, there were 50 deletions relative to the S morphotype genomes that ranged in size from 151 bp – 14,979 bp, seven of which were larger than 5 kb. Manual inspection confirmed that all deletions larger than 5 kb were only present in the three L morphotype genomes. L morphotype genes that were at the margins of, or within deletions larger than 1 kb in S morphotypes are listed in Table S4 (genes present in the L morphotype but missing in the S morphotype) using genes in DV901 to represent the L morphotype. Only one deletion in the S morphotype genomes overlapped with secondary metabolite clusters predicted by SMURF (Khaldi et al., 2010) and this deletion is unlikely to impact differential gene expression, because the gene is non-functional in both S and L isolates. The cypA gene of the aflatoxin gene cluster, that encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase required for aflatoxin G production (Ehrlich et al., 2004) has deletions in both morphotypes and the deletion is larger by 575 bp in the S morphotype. L morphotype genes that were deleted in the S morphotype genomes also included genes that are predicted to encode proteins involved in carbon metabolism (a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 12 and an alcohol dehydrogenase), nitrogen metabolism (a glutamine synthetase and a member of the NmrA-like protein family), and amino acid transport (a member of the proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter (POT) family) (Table S4). S morphotype genes that were at the margins of, or within deletions larger than 1 kb in L morphotypes are listed in Table S5 (genes present in the S morphotype but missing in the L morphotype) using genes in AZS to represent the S morphotype. Seven deletions in the L morphotype genomes occurred within secondary metabolite gene clusters predicted by SMURF (Khaldi et al., 2010). S morphotype genes that were deleted in the L morphotype included genes that encode proteins predicted to be involved in secondary metabolism (two polyketide synthases) and detoxification or biosynthesis of compounds (four cytochrome P450s). A schematic diagram of the two largest deletions in the S and L morphotype genomes are depicted in Fig. S2. In addition to the deletions, DELLY (Rausch et al., 2012) analysis revealed four inversions between the S and L morphotype genomes and one duplication in the L morphotype genomes; however manual inspection of these structural variants could not confirm their presence. There were no translocations that were detected by DELLY analysis (Rausch et al., 2012). GO term enrichment and gene family expansion/contraction analyses GO terms that were enriched in the genomes of each morphotype are listed in Table 3. S morphotype genomes were enriched in functions involved in secondary metabolism, such as isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthetic process (GO:0033075), (S)-stylopine synthase activity (GO:0047052), and N-methylcoclaurine 3′-monooxygenase activity (GO:0050593) that are involved in alkaloid biosynthesis or metabolism, as well as, branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic process (GO:0009082) and dihydroxy-acid dehydratase activity (GO:0004160) that can play a role in glucosinolate biosynthesis or in other pathways. S morphotype genomes were also enriched in processes generally involved in lipid metabolism including fatty acyl-CoA biosynthetic process (GO:0046949) and medium-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase activity (GO:0031956). In L morphotype genomes, enriched GO categories were exclusively involved in amino acid transport. GO terms enriched in S and L morphotype genomes GO ID Name Ontology source p-value.

Comparison of protein families between S and L morphotype genomes revealed 68 protein families that are unique or expanded in the S morphotype genomes with six of these being unique to the S morphotype (Table 4). The hypergeometric test (p-value < 0.05) showed the DUF3589 protein family of unknown function (PF12141; p-value = 0.016) was significantly enriched in S morphotype genomes, with one protein containing two DUF3589 domains in the S morphotype, and none in the L morphotype genomes. CAZy annotation of the DUF3589 family protein predicts it is a β-1,2-mannosyltransferase and this is supported by sequence similarity to a β-mannosyltransferase of Candida albicans (KHC29884; 86% query coverage, 30% identity). S morphotype-unique protein families included proteins predicted to be involved in pyruvate metabolism (PF01326; pyruvate phosphate dikinase, PF00391 and PF028966; PEP-utilizing enzymes), an antifungal protein (PF11402), and a heme oxygenase (PF01126). S morphotype genomes also contained more copies of dehydratase (PF00920), chromate transporter (PF02417), ABC-2 transporter (PF01061), and ERG2 and Sigma 1 receptor like protein (PF04622) families. Protein families (Pfams) unique to or significantly expanded in S or L morphotype genomes. P-values (< 0.1) from the Pfam enrichment analysis are listed in the last column; p-values < 0.05 are in bold.

In L morphotype genomes, 59 protein families were expanded of which none were unique to the L morphotype (Table 4). The hypergeometric test showed the L morphotype genomes were significantly enriched in the LysM domain family (PF01476; p-value = 0.009) and Ankyrin repeats (3 copies) family (PF12796). LysM domains bind peptidoglycan or chitin, and in some plant pathogenic fungi LysM-containing proteins constitute effectors that allow evasion of host immune systems (Kombrink and Thomma 2013). Among protein families expanded in L morphotype genomes were the POT domain (PF00854) and amino acid permease (PF00324); the latter finding supports the GO analysis that showed enrichment in amino acid transporters. In addition, there were more copies of protein families predicted to be involved in nitrogen metabolism, and these include arginase (PF00491), serine aminopeptidase S33 (PF12146), peptidase family M28 (PF04389), prolyl oligopeptidase (PF00326), and trypsin (PF00089) protein families. Morphotype-unique proteins To identify proteins unique to the S morphotype, clustering with Orthofinder (Emms and Kelly 2015) resulted in 304 clusters that consisted of proteins found only in the S morphotype genomes (Figure 3), and out of these, 279 were encoded by genes that were positionally conserved on contigs (positional orthologs). These clusters were filtered further by eliminating those that contained genes with significant BLASTn hits (≥80% identity and ≥80% query coverage) (Altschul et al., 1990) against contigs of L morphotype genomes. This reduced the total to 191 proteins unique to the S morphotype genomes. Similarly, to identify proteins unique to the L morphotype, clustering with Orthofinder (Emms and Kelly 2015) resulted in 189 clusters that consisted of proteins from only L morphotype genomes (Figure 3), and out of these, 164 were encoded by positionally orthologous genes. Filtering the clusters further by BLASTn analysis (Altschul et al., 1990) reduced the total to 82 proteins unique to the L morphotype genomes. Mapping the morphotype-unique proteins on the pseudogenomes of AZS and DV901 revealed they are distributed across all chromosomes in both morphotypes (Figure 4). Numbers of morphotype-unique proteins identified using this approach is likely an underestimate, because morphotype-unique proteins that are due to pseudogenization of genes in one morphotype from the accumulation of SNPs will not be detected due to retention of high sequence similarity between the genomes.

Morphotype-unique proteins with predicted Pfam, CAZy, MEROPS, and SMURF annotations are listed in Table S6 (S morphotype-unique proteins) and Table S7 (L morphotype-unique proteins). Below, we highlight morphotype-unique proteins that may play a role in niche adaptation, such as genes predicted to be involved in environmental response, gene regulation, secondary metabolism, and nutrient metabolism. The S morphotype-unique proteins included proteins proposed to be involved in environmental responses; one is in the SUR7/PalI family (PF01349; a putative environmental sensor), and another has a CS domain (PF04969) predicted to bind to Hsp90, suggesting it is also a putative environmental response protein. S morphotype-unique proteins also included several involved in gene regulation; four are likely transcriptional regulators (containing the fungal specific transcription factor domain; PF04082), two may be involved in post-transcriptional regulation (belonging to the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome protein family; PF01172, involved in RNA metabolism), and two may play a role in epigenetic regulation (an RNA dependent RNA polymerase; PF05183, and a protein with a SET domain; PF00856, involved in histone methylation). Other S morphotype-unique proteins were involved in nutrient metabolism. Proteins that play a role in carbon metabolism included an alcohol dehydrogenase (PF08240), an isocharismatase (PF00857), two glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductases (PF05199, PF00732), a lactate/malate dehydrogenase (PF02866, PF00056), and a pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PF01326). Proteins that play a role in nitrogen metabolism included an astacin (PF01400), a DJ-1/PfpI peptidase (PF01965), a fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) hydrolase (PF01557), and a carbon-nitrogen hydrolase (PF00795). In addition, the S morphotype had unique proteins that indicate a role in microbial competition. Those that may confer antimicrobial activity included a polyketide synthase (PF14765), an antifungal protein (PF11402), and a MAC/perforin (PF01823). Others that may play a role in detoxifying antimicrobials or toxic compounds produced by themselves or by others included six cytochrome P450s (PF00067), a glyoxylase/bleomycin resistance protein (PF00903), and a lipopolysaccharide kinase (PF06293). The L morphotype-unique proteins contained a different set of regulatory proteins: transcriptional regulators including seven fungal specific transcription factors (PF04082, PF011951), putative post-transcriptional regulators (DEAD box RNA helicase; PF00270, PF00076), and epigenetic regulators (lysine methyltransferase; PF10294). Some L morphotype-unique proteins were involved in nutrient metabolism including carbon metabolism (alcohol dehydrogenase; PF08240), nitrogen metabolism (arginase; PF00491, trypsin; PF00089, and FAA hydrolase; PF01557), and lipid metabolism (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; PF00441, PF02770, PF02771, and enoyl-CoA hydratase; PF00378). The L morphotype also had unique proteins that may confer antimicrobial activity (a protein with a Snoal-like domain; PF12680) or may detoxify compounds (RTA1-like protein; PF04479, cytochrome P450; PF00067). Genes under selection Analysis by POTION (Hongo et al., 2015) identified 12 genes under selection in S morphotype genomes and 2 genes under selection in L morphotype genomes (Table 5). Genes under selection in S morphotype genomes were predicted to encode two fungal specific transcription factors (PF11951, PF04082), a polyprenyl synthetase (PF00348), a HET protein (PF06985), a eukaryotic cytochrome b561 (PF03188), a eukaryotic elongation factor 5A hypusine (PF01287), and other proteins with unknown functions. These genes were distributed across chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and an unknown contig (assembled from contigs that did not map to A. oryzae RIB40). The eukaryotic elongation factor 5A hypusine gene under selection was located within the large inversion identified on chromosome 8. Genes under selection in L morphotype genomes were predicted to encode a sugar transporter (PF00083) and a protein with an unknown function. These genes were located on chromosomes 3 and 5.

Differences in secondary metabolite clusters, antibiotic resistance proteins, CAZy, and MEROPS peptidases between morphotypes The number of secondary metabolite clusters and their backbone genes that were predicted by SMURF (Khaldi et al., 2010) are shown in Figure 5A. There was no notable difference in the number of secondary metabolite clusters between morphotypes, but S morphotype genomes contained 1 – 2 more copies of PKS-like proteins and L morphotype genomes contained 1 – 2 more copies of HYBRID PKS-NRPS proteins. Ten S morphotype-unique proteins belonged to five secondary metabolite clusters and three L morphotype-unique proteins belonged to three secondary metabolite clusters, indicating compositions of several secondary metabolite clusters differ between morphotypes.

(D) MEROPS categories (Rawlings et al., 2012) with differences in copy numbers between S and L morphotype genomes. Abbreviations: PfpI endopeptidase family/cysteine peptidase (C56), aminopeptidase Y family/metallo peptidase (M28), chymostrypsin family/serine peptidase (S01), D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase B family/serine peptidase (S12). The number of proteins predicted to confer antibiotic resistance in S and L morphotype genomes is shown in Figure 5B. Comparing annotations to the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (CARD) revealed that S morphotype genomes have an additional copy of DesR; a protein involved in self-resistance to antibiotics produced in Streptomyces venezuelae, and 1 – 2 additional copies of AbcA; an ABC transporter that can confer resistance to methicillin, daptomycin, cefotaxime, and moenomycin (Jia et al., 2017). The remaining CARD categories had the same number of copies in the genomes of both morphotypes. None of the proteins annotated by CARD belonged to the morphotype-unique protein set, but this is likely because a conservative approach was used to identify morphotype-unique proteins. Carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZy) categories that were present in different copy numbers in S and L morphotype genomes are represented in Figure 5C. Comparison of CAZy annotations revealed that S morphotype genomes contain a unique β-1,2-mannosyltransferase (GT91) that was also identified in the morphotype-unique protein analysis. In addition, the S morphotype genomes contained more copies of three carbohydrate esterase families: CE1, CE5 that contain cutinases, and CE10 that acts on non-carbohydrate substrates. The S morphotype also contains more members of three glycoside hydrolase families: GH10 and GH11 that contain xylanases, and GH25 that contain lysozymes. L morphotype genomes did not contain any morphotype-unique CAZy categories, but contained more copies of carbohydrate-binding module family 50 domains that bind to peptidoglycan and chitin (CBM50). Peptidase and peptidase inhibitor (MEROPS) categories that were present in different copy numbers in S and L morphotype genomes are represented in Figure 5D. Comparison of MEROPS annotations revealed that the S morphotype genomes contained more copies of PfPI endopeptidase (C56) family, whereas the L morphotype genomes contained more copies of aminopeptidase Y (M28E), chymotrypsin (S01A), and D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase B (S12) families. Phylogenetic analysis A maximum likelihood tree with clade support values (>50%) is presented in Figure 6. The S isolates used in the current genomic analyses along with S isolate Yuin20 formed a distinct clade from most other A. flavus isolates with high support. The major clade (indicated with the arrow in Figure 6) included all L isolates except Sukhothai16, as well as some S isolates; five of these S isolates formed a subclade. The three L isolates used for the genomic analyses are present in this major clade, distinct from the S isolates used in the genomic analyses. The number of polymorphic sites was low among all the A. flavus isolates and thus resolution within the major clade was limited. Two isolates, L isolate Sukhothai16 and S isolate Sanpotong22, placed separate from these described clades.
