3. Results The tissue–cultured seedlings maintained good physiological conditions after co–culture with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 (Figure S1E–G). However, some of the leaves inoculated with Alt XHYN2 were slightly yellowed with some rot. This was most likely due to the fact that Alt XHYN2 belongs to the fungal pathogen Alternaria, which triggers a stronger defence response in the host plant. Inoculation of the endophytes R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 could successfully infect and colonize in tissue–cultured seedlings ‘Rose Honey’, and the isolation rates of Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 were 34% and 32%, respectively. 3.1. RNA–Seq Analysis of Tissue–Cultured Seedlings Treated with Endophyte Inoculation Approximately 49.1–60.3 million raw reads were obtained from all control and treatment groups, while 48.8–59.7 million clean reads were obtained after rigorous quality checks and data filtering. GC percentages for these clean reads ranged from 45.76% to 46.84%. The Q20 and Q30 percentages (quality greater than 20 and 30, respectively, for each base) of all libraries were >95% (Table S2), indicating that the data generated by sequencing are of high quality. To analyse the transcriptome profile, clean reads were mapped to the grapevine reference genome (accession numbers PN40024.v4, http://plants.ensembl.org/Vitis_vinifera/Info/Index) (accessed on 16 January 2021). The mapping ratios for all control and treatment groups were from 88.22% to 93.25%, and between 84.59% and 90.62% of genes were uniquely mapped to a single location. In addition, the proportion of exons was the highest among all libraries, ranging from 93.25% to 95.00%, the proportion of introns ranged from 3.30% to 4.91%, and the proportion of intergenic regions was the lowest, ranging from 1.53% to 1.95% (Table S2). To validate the quality of the RNA–Seq data, seven DEGs that were enriched in primary and secondary metabolic pathways in each sample were selected for qRT–PCR analysis. The RT–qPCR results were consistent with those obtained from the RNA-Seq, except for the gene VIT_11s0065g00350 in sample XHYN2_6h, the gene VIT_10s0003g00470 in samples R2-21_6d and R2-21_15d, the gene VIT_14s0060g02320 in sample XHYN2_15d, and the gene VIT_16s0100g00840 in sample XHYN2_15d (Figure 1), indicating the reliability of the transcriptomic profiling data. Replicates could be grouped into principal component analysis (PCA) plots based on transcript profiles in tissue–cultured seedlings (Figure S2A). Sample groups Con_6h, Con_6d, and Con_15d showed a shorter distance than other groups. In contrast, the two groups R2-21_6h and XHYN2_6h and the four groups R2-21_6d, XHYN2_6d, R2-21_15d, and XHYN2_15d showed shorter distances to each other. These data formed a continuous and distinct set, highlighting that inoculation with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 induced significant gene changes over time in tissue–cultured seedlings. 3.2. Identification of DEGs In the present study, a total of 4783 and 5898 genes were found to be differentially expressed in tissue–cultured seedlings after inoculation with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 for 6 h, 6 d, and 15 d, respectively. In tissue–cultured seedlings after inoculation with Epi R2-21 for 6 h, 6 d, and 15 d, 1853 (1125 up– and 728 downregulated), 3878 (2333 up– and 1545 downregulated), and 4732 (2588 up– and 2144 downregulated) DEGs were identified, respectively (Figure S2B). While in Alt XHYN2 treatments, 2726 (1451 up– and 1275 downregulated), 4610 (2992 up– and 1618 downregulated), and 3938 (2101 up– and 1837 downregulated) DEGs were identified after 6 h, 6 d, and 15 d inoculation, respectively (Figure S2B). A unique set of DEGs (59, 64, 323 DEGs) was upregulated after inoculation with Epi R2-21 for 6 h, 6 d, and 15 d, respectively, and a unique set of DEGs (152, 598, 124) was upregulated after inoculation with Alt XHYN2 for 6 h, 6 d, and 15 d, respectively, while 425 common DEGs were upregulated at all three time points (Figure S2C). In addition, a unique set of DEGs (38, 142, 559) was downregulated after inoculation with Epi R2-21 for 6 h, 6 d, and 15 d, respectively, and a unique set of DEGs (241, 464, 283) was downregulated after inoculation with Alt XHYN2 for 6 h, 6 d, and 15 d, respectively, while 149 common DEGs were downregulated at all three time points (Figure S2D). 3.3. Cluster Analysis, Function Annotation, and Expression Patterns of the DEGs K–mean analysis was performed on the expression levels of the DEGs. As a result, nine expression patterns were identified in the Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 treatments, respectively, and the number of genes varied from 177 to 928 and from 282 to 1203 in each cluster (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Compared to the controls, the gene expression of the Epi R2-21 treatments varied within a certain pattern in each cluster: in clusters 1, 7, 8, the expression of DEGs was consistently upregulated as compared to the control. The DEGs were mainly related to the plant–pathogen interaction, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, citrate cycle, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, etc. (Table 1). In clusters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the expression of DEGs was consistently downregulated as compared to the control. The DEGs were mainly related to carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, photosynthesis–antenna proteins, photosynthesis, ribosome, spliceosome, etc. While in cluster 9, the gene expression decreased from 6 h to 5 d, and increased after 5 d, but genes were not significantly enriched in any pathway in the Epi R2-21 treatments (Figure 2; Table 1). In Alt XHYN2 treatments, the DEGs in clusters 7 and 8 were consistently upregulated as compared to control, mainly related to the citrate cycle, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, circadian rhythm–plant, phenylalanine metabolism, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, etc. In clusters 1, 2, 3, and 5, the DEGs were consistently downregulated as compared to the control, mainly related to porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, ribosome, spliceosome, photosynthesis–antenna proteins, photosynthesis, etc. In cluster 4, the expression tended to increase from 6 h to 13 d but decreased after 13 d; the DEGs were mainly related to plant–pathogen interaction. In cluster 6, the expression tended to decrease from 6 h to 12 d but increased after 12 d; and in cluster 9, the DEGs were initially downregulated but then upregulated as compared to the control. The DEGs in these two clusters were mainly related to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, spliceosome, and ubiquitin–mediated proteolysis (Figure 3; Table 1). We further analysed the functions of the up– and downregulated DEGs to assess their underlying biological significance through GO enrichment analysis (Figure 4). The upregulated DEGs of Epi R2-21 with enriched GO terms were mainly enriched in the negative regulation of endopeptidase activity, metabolic process of benzene–containing compounds, and regulation of endopeptidase activity (Figure 4A); the upregulated DEGs in Alt XHYN2 treatments were significantly enriched in the L–phenylalanine catabolic process, erythrose 4–phosphate/phosphoenolpyruvate family amino acid catabolic process, L–phenylalanine metabolic process, and erythrose 4–phosphate/phosphoenolpyruvate family amino acid metabolic process (Figure 4B). While the downregulated DEGs in Epi R2-21 treatments were enriched in the benzene–containing compound metabolic process, aromatic amino acid family catabolic process, photosynthesis, and light harvesting (Figure 4C); and the downregulated DEGs of Alt XHYN2 were enriched in the L–phenylalanine catabolic process, erythrose 4–phosphate/phosphoenolpyruvate family amino acid catabolic process, photosynthesis, and light harvesting in photosystem I (Figure 4D). The functions of the up– and downregulated DEGs were further analysed to assess their metabolic pathways through KEGG enrichment analysis (Figure 5). The upregulated DEGs in the Epi R2-21 or Alt XHYN2 treatments, both enriched in the KEGG pathway, were found to be mainly involved in secondary metabolism (flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, phenylalanine, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol, and isoquinoline alkaloid, ubiquinone biosynthesis) and primary metabolism (α–linolenic acid metabolism, tyrosine, glutathione, galactose, and cyanoamino acid metabolism), suggesting that inoculation with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 reprograms the primary and secondary metabolism, putatively related to defence activation. The activation of stress responses involved in defence processes such as plant–pathogen interaction, plant MAPK signalling pathway, and circadian rhythm–plant was also observed (Figure 5A,B). Furthermore, the upregulated DEGs in Epi R2-21 treatments were involved in ubiquinone and other terpenoid–quinone biosynthesis and plant hormone signalling (Figure 5A), as well as sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, pentose. and glucuronate interconversions in Alt XHYN2 treatments (Figure 5B). The downregulated DEGs in the Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 treatments were significantly activated in some secondary metabolism (flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid. and gingerolbiosynthesis) and primary metabolism (porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, carotenoid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, brassinosteroid biosynthesis) (Figure 5C,D). In addition, stress responses involved in defence processes were also observed, such as photosynthesis–antenna proteins, photosynthesis, circadian rhythm–plant, and plant hormone signalling (Figure 5C,D). Additionally, the downregulated DEGs in Alt XHYN2 treatments were involved in nitrogen metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and diterpenoid biosynthesis (Figure 5D). 3.4. DEGs Involved in Defence Responses Induced by the Endophytes Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 After inoculation with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 at 6 h, 6 d, and 15 d, a considerable number of DEGs related to defence response pathways, such as the plant–pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, plant MAPK signalling pathway, brassinoid steroid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism pathway, were induced in tissue–cultured seedlings. In particular, most DEGs were induced in the plant–pathogen interaction and plant hormone signalling pathways (Figure 6 and Figure 7). After 6 h, 6 d, and 15 d inoculation, a total of 140 DEGs (88 upregulated and 52 downregulated) related to the plant–pathogen interaction pathway were identified in tissue-cultured seedlings, but 117 and 123 DEGs were identified in Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 treatments, respectively (Table S3). In the plant hormone signalling pathway, a total of 122 DEGs (59 upregulated and 63 downregulated) were induced, but 96 and 102 DEGs were identified in Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 treatments, respectively (Table S4). Among the above DEGs, 10 upregulated genes (1.36–8.77–fold) were commonly expressed across the time points involved in the plant–pathogen interaction and the plant hormone signalling pathways (Figure S3). In the plant–pathogen interaction pathway, one gene encoding calmodulin–like protein (CML), one gene encoding pathogenesis–related protein PR1, two genes encoding disease resistance protein RPM1, one gene encoding respiratory burst oxidase (RBOH), one gene encoding transcription factor WRKY22, and one gene encoding heat shock protein HSP90 were upregulated. In the plant hormone signalling pathway, two genes encoding the auxin–responsive GH3 gene family GH3 and one gene encoding the transcription factor TGA were upregulated. 3.5. DEGs Involved in Secondary Metabolism Induced by the Endophytes Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 In particular, secondary metabolism, such as phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, and stilbenes biosynthesis, was affected by Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2 after inoculation in tissue–cultured seedlings for 6 h, 6 d, and 15 d (Figure 8). According to the KEGG pathway analysis, 39 and 44 DEGs involved in the phenylalanine metabolism pathway were identified in tissue–cultured seedlings inoculated with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2, respectively (Table S5). In the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway (Table S6), 98 and 120 DEGs were identified after inoculation with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2, respectively. Among them, 12 upregulated DEGs were commonly differentially expressed in the above two pathways at all time points. In the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (Table S7), 69 and 67 DEGs were identified after inoculation with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2, respectively. Among them, 29 upregulated DEGs were commonly expressed at all time points. In the stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis pathway (Table S8), 32 and 30 DEGs were identified after inoculation with the endophytes Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN2, respectively, of which 10 upregulated DEGs were commonly differentially expressed across the time points. Among the above DEGs, 43 upregulated genes (1.24–8.55–fold) were commonly differentially expressed across the time points (Figure S4). In addition, the gene VIT_11s0065g00350 encoding transcinnamate 4–monooxygenase (CYP73A) was involved in phenylalanine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, the flavonoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis pathways; 11 genes (VIT_16s0039g01240, VIT_00s2849g00010, VIT_00s2508g00010, VIT_16s0039g01110, VIT_16s0039g01300, VIT_16s0039g01360, VIT_16s0039g01130, VIT_16s0039g01280, VIT_16s0039g01120, VIT_16s0039g01170, VIT_08s0040g01710) encoding phenylalanine ammonia–lyase (PAL) were involved in the phenylalanine metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways; 6 genes (VIT_16s0100g00810, VIT_16s0100g00960, VIT_16s0100g00950, VIT_16s0100g00860, VIT_16s0100g01130, VIT_10s0042g00870) commonly encoding chalcone synthase (CHS) and stilbene synthase (STS) were involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis pathways. 3.6. PPI Analysis of Key Genes Related to Secondary Metabolism against Endophyte Defence At the same time, an interaction network, based on the common upregulated DEGs related to secondary metabolism in tissue–cultured seedlings of ‘Rose Honey’ after inoculation with Epi R2-21 and Alt XHYN, was constructed to select key genes involved in the production of stress–related secondary metabolites (Figure 9). The network consisted of two clusters with 37 nodes and 300 edges. In cluster I, the gene VIT_13s0067g03820 and the genes VIT_16s0100g01000, VIT_16s0100g00910, and VIT_16s0100g01140, encoding CHI and CHS, respectively, involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis, had the highest betweenness centrality scores. In addition, the gene VIT_11s0065g00350 in cluster II was connected to cluster I by the gene VIT_16s0100g01040. The gene VIT_11s0065g00350, encoding CYP73A, was commonly involved in the phenylalanine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis pathways. It is predicted that the above genes play a positive regulatory role in endophyte defence and metabolite production.
