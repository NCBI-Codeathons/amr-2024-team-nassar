Results Bioinformatics analysis reveals enzymatic candidate for C-7 deoxygenation in the cytorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) Comparisons of mammalian and bacterial metabolic systems responsible for anthracycline degradation mechanisms suggest that naturally occurring 7-deoxyanthracyclines 1–5 are generated by specific biosynthetic oxidoreductases. Additionally, heterologous expression studies with the cosmomycin D (bearing a pendant trisaccharide at C-7, Fig. 1) BGC15, which lacks any discernible CytA homolog, suggested that the enzyme/s driving such chemistry are likely encoded beyond the established cos cluster (Fig. 1a); C-7 reduced cosmomycin analogs are not observed among cos cluster products. This inspired us to closely examine uncharacterized genes proximal to the cyt cluster boundaries. Given that no analogues of the KstA15/KstA16 enzyme pair readily stood out in the cyt cluster and that most cyt genes have been functionally characterized, we focused our attention on a three-gene cassette containing cytABC, the only candidates within the cyt cluster that have thus far eluded assignment. The cytA gene is located immediately adjacent to the FAD-linked redox encoding gene cytB consistent with previously noted organizations (Fig. 1b) for aclacinomycin (acl)16, nivetetracyclate (niv)17, cinerubin (cin)18, and cosmomycin D (cos) BGCs15. Comparative analyses encompassing the cyt as well as acl, niv, and cin clusters reveal that AclJ, NivJ and CinSSBG_00486 are homologues of CytA, and that AknOx, NivO, and CinSSBG_00485 are homologues of CytB. Moreover, CytA (151 aa) shows similarity to AclJ (63% identity), to NivJ (63% identity), and to CinSSBG_00486 (60% identity), respectively. BLAST analyses revealed that CytA, shares amino acid sequence similarities with a family of flavin-dependent reductases (Supplementary Fig. 2) and that CytB is a FAD-linked oxidase whereas CytC is an aldo/keto reductase possibly involved in terminal sugar tailoring. On the basis of these bioinformatics and its genetic organization with respect to the three-gene cassette, we envisioned that CytA may function as a deglycosylase with reductive potential during anthracycline processing. To test this hypothesis, we consequently inactivated cytA in vivo and carried out subsequent metabolomics studies. In vivo gene inactivation of cytA and resultant metabolite profiles analyses λ Red-mediated PCR-targeting mutagenesis19,20 was employed to obtain the ∆cytA mutant strain in which cytA was replaced with an apramycin resistance gene cassette. The ∆cytA mutant was verified on the basis of its sensitivity to kanamycin and apramycin resistance along with PCR analyses (Supplementary Fig. 3). Fermentation of the ∆cytA mutant was carried out followed by butanone extractions, solvent removal and resuspension into methanol. The resulting supernatant was then subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and two new peaks, both having the same UV–Vis profile and representative of 6 and 7 (Fig. 1c) were noted although the overall yield was low. Further liquid chromatography-high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-HRESIMS) analyses revealed the molecular formulae of 6 and 7 to be C60H88N2O21 and C60H88N2O22, indicating that 6 and 7 bear one additional trisaccharide chain relative to 3 and 4, respectively. Large-scale fermentation of the ∆cytA mutant strain enabled the isolation of analytically pure 6 and 7 in quantities sufficient for complete structural characterization. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Supplementary Table 2) for 6 and 7 were found to be identical to previously reported cosmomycins C and D (Fig. 1d)6, respectively; detailed 2D NMR (COSY, HMQC, and HMBC) analyses further confirmed these structural assignments. Similarly, fermentations with the ∆cytA mutant in the presence of 3% XAD-16 resin to capture putative early precursor metabolites, led to the visualization of two additional peaks 8 and 9 with different HPLC retention times (Fig. 1c). Large-scale fermentations employing XAD-16 resin and subsequent NMR studies enabled us to elucidate structures 8 and 9 as 10-decarbomethoxy-ε-rhodomycin and ε-rhodomycin (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Table 3)21, respectively. That 6–9 all contained the anticipated C-7 glycoside supports our hypothesis that CytA represents a previously unreported reductive deglycosylase and inspired subsequent in vitro experiments as follows. In vitro biochemical characterization of CytA-catalyzed deglycosylation under anaerobic conditions To explore the biochemical activity of CytA in vitro, the cytA gene was cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pET28a (+) vector and the resulting vector was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) using previously described methods22. CytA was overexpressed as an N-terminally His6-tagged soluble protein and purified to homogeneity by Ni affinity chromatography (Fig. 2a). HHpred analysis revealed that CytA is a flavin-dependent protein but the purified protein is colorless. The activity of CytA was first investigated using substrates 6–9 and ε-rhodomycinone (10) under aerobic conditions. Reactions with CytA were conducted at 37 °C in a volume of 100 μL consisting of 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 25 μM substrate, 0.5 μM CytA, and 20 μM NADH. Reactions with boiled CytA served as controls; all reactions were carried out in parallel to ensure reaction consistency. Reactions were terminated by addition of twofold volume of methanol. As expected, CytA failed, under aerobic conditions to modify any of the substrates 6–10. Carrying out the same reactions using rigorously degassed solutions (see “Methods”) afforded very different results. The absence of O2 enabled CytA to readily convert 6 to 3 and 7 to 4 (Fig. 2b) as revealed by HPLC analyses and comparisons with standards (for 3 and 4) as well as LC-HRESIMS analyses for each reaction. Under no conditions were deglycosylated or dehydrated intermediates ever observed in CytA reactions. The absence of any such intermediates supports CytA’s ability to reductively cleave the C-7 C–O bonds of 6 and 7; CytA appears to not require hydrolytic or dehydrative chemistries en route to C-7 reduction. On the heels of this finding we then determined the kinetic parameters of CytA using 6 and 7 as substrates. The resulting kinetic data (Table 1) revealed that CytA possesses high catalytic efficiency with Km of 14.32 and 17.88 μM, and that, of the two substrates evaluated, 6 is preferred. Additionally, CytA showed some enzymatic promiscuity when using 8–10 as substrates (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2Biochemical characterization of CytA in vitro.a SDS-PAGE analysis of CytA.

CytA catalyzes reductive deglycosylation of clinically employed anthracycline drugs In parallel, a set of C-7-O-glycosylated clinically employed anthracyclines including daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin and pirarubicin (22–26) (Supplementary Fig. 4) were screened for their ability to serve as CytA substrates in vitro. These trials, in particular highlighted the apparent promiscuity of CytA to effect anthracycline deglycosylation chemistry; all five clinical agents were subject to CytA-mediated C-7 reduction/deglycosylatiion albeit with differing efficiencies (Supplementary Figs. 5–7). Enzyme kinetic data for these assays rendered similar Km values (28.47–49.33 μM, Table 1) for all the clinical anthracyclines evaluated. Overall, CytA was found to be 2–3 fold more efficient at processing initial test substrates 6 and 7 than it was for processing 22–26. Notwithstanding, it was surprising to realize that CytA is less efficient (Km value 31.18 μM, kcat 0.14 min−1) at generating ζ-rhodomycinone (11) from 10 given that C-7 hydroxylated aglycones are more sensitive to reduction in sharply contrast to their glycosidic derivatives by exogenous redox enzymes12. Overall, these data clearly demonstrate the ability of CytA to serve as a reductive deglycosidase. Antibacterial and cytotoxic activity assessments for metabolites 1–13 We carefully evaluated the antibacterial activities of compounds 1–13 (Fig. 1) using a set of five gram-positive bacteria (Table 2) and found that 6 and 7 were more potent antimicrobial agents than their C-7 deglycosylated counterparts 3 and 4. Notably, the removal of the sugar moieties at both C-7 and C-9 positions dramatically reduced antibacterial activities (compounds 10 and 11, MIC values > 32 μg/mL). These findings are consistent with earlier reports in which 6 and 7 were found to be >100-fold more active against Staphylococcus aureus than their reduced congeners 3 and 4, respectively6. This seemed at first to also be the trend for cytotoxicity; cosmomycin C (6) displayed an IC50 of 0.21 μM against MDA-MB-468 cells whereas its C-7 reduced analog cosmomycin B (4) was devoid of activity23. However, in assessing the cytotoxic activities of 1–10 against a panel of tumor cell lines (Table 3) we found that compounds 6 and 7 showed no significant differences in IC50 values relative to their deglycosylated counterparts 3 and 4. At the same time, we noted that cytorhodins X and Y (final biosynthetic products 1 and 2) bearing the C-9α-glycoside, (absent in both 3 and 4), were less active in both antimicrobial and cytotoxicity assays than their accumulated intermediates 3, 4, 6, and 7. This observation strongly suggests that C-7 deglycosylation markedly limits anthracycline bioactivities and that this reaction, especially in light of our findings with CytA, likely constitutes an important self-preservation mechanism for microbial producers of these secondary metabolites.Table 2Antimicrobial activities of compounds 1–13.CompoundMIC values (μg/mL)BSSA1SA2BTEF12224221214430.50.250.1250.250.0640.250.250.1250.250.03588816860.060.030.0050.1250.00170.030.010.0050.1250.00288488498444810>32>32>32>32>3211>32>32>32>32>3212>32>32>32>32>3213>32>32>32>32>32Van0.50.510.50.25Amp44842BS

We also noted that the ∆cytA mutant strain accumulated small amounts (80~100-fold lower than WT producer) of the immediate biosynthetic precursors of cosmomycins A (3) and B (4). The in vitro antimicrobial activities of compounds 1–13 against a panel of gram-positive bacteria (Table 2) provided some insight into the possible physiological significance of CytA-catalyzed reductions. Furthermore, we had observed that the ΔcytA mutant strain is clearly impaired relative to the WT strain upon addition of 6 or 7 as potential substrates. To evaluate this effect, we probed the sensitivity of Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666 to 6 and 7 in an inhibition zone assay (Fig. 3). A clear inhibition zone (16 mm) using the ΔcytA mutant plate was observed when supplemented with 1 μg of 6 or 7. Alternatively, the WT producer appeared to resist the antimicrobial effects of 6 and 7 and displayed little to no growth inhibition near paper discs impregnated with 6 or 7. That CytA production endows cosmomycin resistance provides strong evidence that the cytA gene directly confers Streptomyces. sp.

Phylogenetic analysis of CytA and its homologs CytA belongs to a family of reductases widely distributed in Bacteria, Archaea and Eukayota. Phylogenetic analysis of CytA revealed its association with incompletely characterized gene products (Supplementary Fig. 8). Notably, most homologous proteins derived from bacteria, especially Streptomyces and Micromonospora, remain largely uncharacterized. CytA also showed similarity with Eukaryota-derived glycoside hydrolase family 74 protein (40.0% identity) from Colletotrichum tofieldiae. The secondary metabolites of these CytA homologues containing microorganisms were largely unexplored. Our work here suggests that CytA and its homologs likely constitute an unidentified self-resistance mechanism associated with anthracycline biosynthetic machineries. As such, these enzymes and their encoding genes may serve as genetic markers for use in genome mining initiatives focused on identifying new anthracyclines from assorted microbial producers (Supplementary Fig. 9).
