Results Identification of strain L1 using morphological and molecular markers An endophyte (strain L1) was obtained from L. maackii (Rupr.) Maxim (Figure 1A). The strain L1 exhibited phenotypic similarity to the Bacillus spp. with respect to the biochemical, morphological, Gram staining, and cultural characteristics. Nucleotide blast on NCBI revealed that strain L1 shared extremely high similarity with Bacillus velezensis species (99%). On the basis of the strain L1 16S rRNA’s sequence and blast alignment results, MEGA-X was employed to construct a phylogenetic neighbor connection tree that reflected the evolutionary relationship for L1 (Figure 1B). Combining all the resulting analyses, the isolate was identified to be B. velezensis (GenBank Accession No. ON340771).

In vitro antifungal activity of VOCs Figure 2 presents the findings related to the antifungal activity of VOCs produced by B. velezensis L1. Mycelial development, spore germination, and sporulation ability of A. iridiaustralis were significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited by VOCs produced by strain L1. An increased inoculum concentration of B. velezensis L1 improved VOC-induced inhibition. Furthermore, increasing the concentration also enhanced the inhibitory effect of VOCs on pathogenic fungi. The mycelial growth of plug and spore suspensions was inhibited by the bacterial suspension at 1 × 109 CFU/ml by approximately 92.86 and 90.30%, respectively (Figures 2A,B); the spore germination and sporulation processes were inhibited by 33.11 and 12.04%, respectively (Figures 2C,D). A. iridiaustralis fumigated with VOCs grew more slowly than usual, as observed in (Figure 2E). The hyphal morphology of pathogenic fungi are dramatically altered by VOCs, as observed through SEM. The treatment group’s hyphae were twisted, flattened, enlarged, and lost their linearity compared with the control group (Figure 2F). Figure 2Antifungal activity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by B. velezensis L1 against A. iridiaustralis in vitro. LB plates were coated with 80 μl of bacterial suspension at the concentration of 106, 107, 108, 109 colony forming units (CFU)/ml and then incubated at 37°C for 2 days. Their lids were subsequently replaced with PDA plates containing a 6 mm-diameter fungal disk or 20 μl of spore suspension of A. iridiaustralis. These plates were incubated at 28°C for 7 days.

In vivo biocontrol effects of VOCs To investigate the impact of VOC concentration on the effectiveness of biocontrol ability of VOC in vivo, various numbers of LB plates containing viable cells were used. VOCs considerably impeded the growth and spread of A. iridiaustralis (Figure 3). No mycelial was observed growth on the wolfberry fruits after exposure to the 8 LB plates. The decay incidence and disease index of the treatment group were 4.45 and 3.33%, respectively, which were considerably lower than those of the control group (100 and 50.67%, respectively). In general, biological control effects were better at higher VOC concentrations.

Effect of VOCs on postharvest natural decay Figure 4 demonstrates the outcomes of the impact of VOCs on the fruit’s natural decay after harvest. Under natural circumstances, the VOCs generated by B. velezensis L1 had a larger inhibitory effect on the decay incidence of postharvest wolfberry as the number of LB plates increased. The best inhibitory effect was observed when 8 LB plates were used, the wolfberry fruit was intact, and the lowest disease index was 3.33. Figure 42, 4, 6 and 8 LB plates were used to fumigate untreated wolfberry fruit. The container were sealed and followed by incubation at room temperature for 7 days, the decay incidence (A) and disease index (B) were measured.

HS-GC-IMS identification of VOCs From Figure 5, the whole VOC information of each sample as well as the variations in VOCs across samples can be observed when each row represents all signal peaks selected in a single sample and each column represents the signal peaks of the same VOC in numerous samples. The chemical’s concentration is qualitatively represented by the hues of the peaks; the higher the red color, the higher the concentration. Table 2 lists a collection of specific details. Strain L1 produced the following recognized VOCs: 2-butanone, 2,3-butanedione, 1-hydroxy-2-propanone, 2-pentanone, acetoin, 2-heptanone, cyclohexanone, methyl 2-methylbutanoate, 2-pentylfuran, and 2-methylpropyl butanoate.

Alternaria iridiaustralis is inhibited by a single known VOC The effects of nine components on the growth of A. iridiaustralis mycelium were determined (Table 3). Among the nine tested pure substances, only 2,3-butanedione (40 μl/L) showed a strong effect, completely inhibiting the growth of the A. iridiaustralis mycelium. The remaining substances, including 1-hydroxy-2-propanone, 2-pentanone, acetoin, 2-heptanone, cyclohexanone, methyl 2-methylbutanoate, 2-pentylfuran and 2-methylpropyl butanoate, showed very weak or no antifungal activity on PDA plates.

Broad spectrum antifungal activity of volatiles from Bacillus velezensis L1 Ten important pathogenic fungi including P. capsici, C. capsici, F. oxysporum, B. cinerea, R. solani, F. graminearum, F. annulatum, T. tumuli, C. fioriniae and F. arcuatisporum, were used to test the broad antifungal activity of B. velezensis L1. In the strain L1 treatment, the mycelial growth of the pathogenic fungi was greatly inhibited (Figure 6). The inhibition rate of L1 strain against the nine pathogenic strains was >80%. These results suggest that active volatiles produced by B. velezensis L1 have a broad antifungal activity against different genera of pathogenic fungi.
