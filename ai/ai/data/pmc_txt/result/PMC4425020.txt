2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Screening of the Growth Medium for Electro-Competent Cells An appropriate growth medium is an important factor for determining the electroporation efficiency of bacteria [11,28,29]. In the selected optimal growth medium, four types of growth medium (LBS, LBSP, NCM and BHIS) were investigated to prepare the electro-competent cells of B. subtilis ZK. These mediums have been used as the growth mediums for preparing electro-competent in Gram-positive strains [9,11,28]. The first three mediums are suitable for preparing electro-competent cells of B. amyloliquefaciens. Nutrient BHIS medium is regarded as the proper medium for the Gram-positve Corynebacterium glutamicum [28]. Table 1 shows that the LBSP medium yielded a higher efficiency (1.3 × 104 transformants/μg of DNA) than the LBS, NCM, and BHIS media. Consequently, the LBSP medium was proved to be the appropriate medium for B. subtilis ZK and used to prepare the electro-competent cells in the subsequent experiments. Effect of growth media on the electroporation efficiency of B. subtilis ZK. Media EE a Reference. LBS 4 × 103 ± 0.62 × 103 [9]. LBSP 1.3 × 104 ± 0.17 × 104 [29]. NCM 7 × 102 ± 0.39 × 102 [30]. BHIS 1.6 × 102 ± 0.82 × 102 [31]. When the OD600 value reached 0.65, the electro-transformed competent cells were prepared. Then, one hundred nanograms of pHT43 plasmid were used for each electroporation experiment. The field strength was 20 kV∙cm−1 and the electroporation buffer was TSM. a EE, electroporation efficiency (cfu/μg of DNA). In the previous report, NCM medium yielded higher electroporation efficiency than LBSP medium in B. amyloliquefaciens [11]. However, the opposite result was found in the B. subtilis ZK and we found some lysis of B. subtilis ZK in the NCM medium, which indicated that the ion concentration in NCM may be too high for B. subtilis ZK. 2.2. Effect of Growth Phase on the Electroporation Efficiency Growth phase markedly affects the electroporation efficiency [15,32]. To investigate the effect of growth phase on the electroporation efficiency, electro-competent cells were prepared at different OD600 values (0.3–1.3). Figure 1 presents the relationship between the electroporation efficiency and the growth phase. The results show that proper growth phase (OD600 0.7–1) yielded higher electroporation efficiency and an efficiency of 4 × 104 transformants/μg of DNA was obtained when the OD600 value reached 0.85. In contrast with results of B. cereus [15] and B. thuringiensis [32], where the early phase of exponential growth (OD600 0.1–0.4) yielded the highest electroporation efficiency, our results indicated that the late phase of exponential growth (OD600 0.7–1) yielded the highest electroporation efficiency in B. subtilis ZK. Similar results have been observed in B. subtilis IH6140 and B. amyloliqueficence [9], as well as C. pseudotuberculosis [22] in which the late phase of exponential growth was required to obtain the highest electroporation efficiency. Figure 1Effects of growth phase of B. subtilis ZK on the electroporation efficiency. B. subtilis ZK was grown in LBSP medium and the electro-competent cells were prepared at different OD600 values (0.3–1.3). One hundred nanograms of the pHT43 plasmid were used for each electroporation experiment. The field strength was 20 kV·cm−1 and the electroporation buffer was TSM. The experiments were repeated three times. The error bars indicate the standard deviations from the average values. Effects of growth phase of B. subtilis ZK on the electroporation efficiency.

Effect of Electric Field on the Electroporation Efficiency Applying high electric field is an approach to overcome the wall of B. subtilis, which improves the permeabilization of membrane and produces Bacillus cells accessible by exogenous plasmid [11]. However, an exorbitant electric field results in death of cells. To optimize the electric field for B. subtilis ZK, electroporation experiments were performed under a gradient of field strength (8–26 kV·cm−1). The relationship between the field strength and the electroporation efficiency is shown in Figure 2. An electric field of 20 kV·cm−1 led to the optimal efficiency (4 × 104 transformants/μg of DNA), and this value was thus used in the follow-up experiments. The electric fields at around 5–10 kV·cm−1 are appropriate conditions for most bacterial cells and can produce the pores accessible by plasmid [10]. In the present study, we found that a high electric field (20 kV·cm−1) yielded the highest electroporation efficiency in B. subtilis ZK. Similarly high electric field (18–20 kV·cm−1) has been observed in B. amyloliqueficence [11], B. cereus [15], B. licheniformis [9], and B. thuringiensis [14]. These results indicated that the high electric field was required to achieve the high electroporation efficiency in Bacillus strains. Figure 2Effects of the field strength on the electroporation efficiency of B. subtilis ZK. B. subtilis ZK was grown in LBSP medium and the electro-competent cells were prepared when the OD600 value reached 0.85.

The data shown are the averages of three independent experiments, and the error bars indicate the standard deviations from the average values.

Investigation the Concentration of Wall-Weakening Agent for RSM Design Application of weakening agents is an important means to improve the electroporation efficiency in Bacillus. Glycine, dl-threonine, Tween 80, and ampicillin are widely used to increase the electroporation efficiency in Bacillus strains. Glycine and dl-threonine can be integrated into the walls of cells and replace the alanine, deducing the peptidoglycan linkage and loosening the walls of cells [33]. The Tween 80 can increase the electroporation efficiency, likely because the Tween 80 loosens the cell walls and disturbs the cell–membrane fluidity [11]. To investigate the concentration of wall-weakening agent for RSM design, the four types of wall-weakening agents (glycine, dl-threonine, Tween 80, and ampicillin) were individually used to prepare the electro-competent cells. The results, which are exhibited in Figure 3, show the individual effect of the weakening agent on the electroporation efficiency. The four types of weakening agents all exhibited an enhancing effect on the electroporation efficiency. Specifically, 0.75% glycine, 1% dl-threonine, and 0.07% Tween 80 yielded efficiencies of 2.75 × 105, 4.5 × 105 and 3.4 × 105 transformants/µg of DNA, respectively (Figure 3A–C). In addition, 10 µg/mL ampicillin showed best effect on the electroporation efficiency and improved the efficiency to 5 × 105 transformants/µg of DNA, which is a 12.5-fold increase compared with the LBSP medium alone (Figure 3D). All these weakening agents yielded significant increases in electroporation efficiency (one order of magnitude) and the order in which the weakening agents contributed to electroporation efficiency was ampicillin > dl-threonine > Tween 80 > glycine. In contrast with the result of B. cereus [15], where the weakening agents (glycine, dl-threonine) had a negative effect on the electroporation efficiency, our results indicated that the wall-weakening agents played a crucial role in improving electroporation efficiency for B. subtilis ZK. A similar positive effect has been found in B. amyloliquefaciens [11], Gordonia [34], B. thuringiensis [14], and C. pseudotuberculosis [22], in which a certain ratio of weakening agents was required to obtain high electroporation efficiency. Figure 3Effects of wall-weakening agents on the electroporation efficiency of B. subtilis ZK. Various weakening agents at different concentration gradients (0.25%–0.85% glycine (A); 0.63%–1.56% dl-threonine (B); 15–110 mg/mL Tween 80 (C) and 1–20 μg/mL ampicillin (D)) were separately added to the LBSP medium when the OD600 value reached 0.5. After shaking for an additional 1 h, the electro-competent cells were prepared. One hundred nanograms of pHT43 were used for each electroporation experiment. The field strength was 20 kV·cm−1 and the electroporation buffer was TSM. The values shown are the averages from three independent experiments and the error bars indicate the standard deviations from the average values.

RSM Design for Investigating the Combination of Wall-Weakening Agents Operating parameters have combined effect on the electroporation efficiency [19,25]. To evaluate the combinatorial effects of wall-weakening agents on the electroporation efficiency, a Box-Behnken response surface design (BBD) including 17 trials was used. The BBD experimental design with the predicted and observed electroporation efficiencies are shown in Table 2. The observed electroporation efficiency was regressed to obtain a mathematical model shown in Equation (1). Although ampicillin yielded a 12.5-fold increase in above experiments, it did not exhibit a combined effect with other wall-weakening agents and reduced the electroporation efficiency in combinatorial experiments. Therefore, ampicillin was not used in the combinatorial experiments. Box-Behnken response surface (BBD) design with the predicted and observed electroporation efficiencies.

A Pareto analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to evaluate the adjusted determination coefficient (R2Adj) and the coefficient of variance (CV), which represents the fitness of the quadratic polynomial and the accuracy of the quadratic polynomial, respectively. The R2Adj of the quadratic polynomial, which reached 0.997, showed good agreement between the predicted and the observed values, indicating that the mathematical model was reliable. The relatively low CV value for the quadratic polynomial (2.5%) exhibited the high precision and reliability of the conducted trials. The ANOVA of the quadratic polynomial is shown in Table 3.

Using the optimal formulation (0.64% glycine, 1.02% dl-threonine, and 0.05% Tween 80) determined by the BBD design, an average efficiency of 6.3 × 106 transformants/μg of DNA, which was close to the predicted value (7.38 × 106 transformants/μg of DNA), was archived. These results indicated that RSM is a suitable tool for optimizing the electroporation conditions and provided the first demonstration of using a response surface design to improve the electroporation efficiency in B. subtilis. In contrast with the many experimental designs for wall-weakening agents treatment [14,15,22,32], where the monofactorial experimental designs were used to optimize the concentration of weakening agent and small increases (less than one order of magnitude) in electroporation efficiency were obtained, our results indicated that weakening agents can yield higher increase (two orders of magnitude) with a multifactorial experimental design (RSM). 2.6. Effect of Electroporation Buffer on the Electroporation Efficiency The composition of the electroporation buffer is closely related to the electroporation efficiency. Under the above-described optimized conditions, five types of buffers (MSG, MKK, SMKK, TSM, and TSMKK) were investigated. The first four buffers have been reported as the electroporation buffers for preparing electro-competent in Bacillus [9,14,35]. The results, which are listed in Table 5, show that the electroporation buffers supplemented with trehalose have positive effect on the electroporation efficiency and indicate that the TSMMKK buffer is a better electroporation buffer than other tested buffers for B. subtilis ZK. In contrast with results of other wild-type B. subtilis [20], where an electroporation buffer supplemented with trehalose (TSM) did not affect the electroporation efficiency, our results indicated that trehalose buffer is suitable for the wild-type B. subtilis ZK. The similar positive effects have been found in the B. subtilis DB104 and B. subtilis WB600 [20]. To the best of our knowledge, this is first study applying the TSMMKK buffer that found improved electroporation efficiency. Effects of electroporation buffers on the electroporation efficiency.

When the OD600 value reached 0.5, 0.64% Glycine, 1.02% dl-threonine, and 0.05% Tween 80 were added to the growth medium (LBSP). After shaking for 1 h, the electro-competent cells were prepared. Then, one hundred nanograms of pHT43 plasmid were used for each electroporation experiment. The field strength was 20 kV·cm−1. a EE, electroporation efficiency (cfu/μg of DNA). In the present study, we found that freezing did not obviously decrease the electroporation efficiency of electro-competent cells within one month (data not shown). Since we did not add any glycerol or other cryoprotectants to store electro-competent cells at −80 °C, we suggest that the trehalose may act as cryoprotectants for electro-competent cells stored at −80 °C. Therefore, the TSMMKK buffer is a good option for improving electroporation efficiency and using the electro-competent cells within the following month. 2.7. The Effect of Heat Shock and Plasmid Quantity on the Electroporation Efficiency Restriction-modification system is an obstacle of introducing the plasmid into Gram-positive strains. The heat shock is usually applied to reduce the activity of a host restriction-modification system and to improve transformation efficiency [24,36,37,38]. To determine whether the heat shock would improve the electroporation efficiency, a water bath suitable for Gram-positive strains was performed after electroporation according to previous reports [11,24]. In addition, different quantities of the plasmids (5–500 ng) were used to investigate the effect of plasmid quantity on the electroporation efficiency. The results exhibited in Figure 4 show that a water bath at 46 °C decreased the electroporation efficiency of B. subtilis ZK and the 10 nanograms yielded higher efficiency than other quantities. In contrast with results of C. pseudotuberculosis [22], C. glutamicum [24], and B. amyloliquefaciens [11], where a water bath at 46 °C after electroporation yielded a significant increase in transformation efficiency, our results indicated that heat treatment did not work for B. subtilis ZK and decreased the electroporation efficiency. Figure 4Plots of the electroporation efficiency as a function of the DNA quantity. When the OD600 value reached 0.5, the weakening agents (0.64% Glycine, 1.02% dl-threonine, and 0.05% Tween 80) were added to the LBSP medium and the electro-competent competent cells were prepared. B. subtilis ZK cells were transformed with various quantities of the plasmid DNA (5–500 ng). The field strength was 20 kV·cm−1 and the electroporation buffer was TSMMKK. After electroporation, the cells were incubated in a water bath at 30 or 46 °C. The electroporation experiments were repeated three times, and the data shown are the means of triplicate experiments. The error bars indicate the standard deviations from the average values. Plots of the electroporation efficiency as a function of the DNA quantity.

Validation of Electroporation Efficiency: A Case Study Using the optimized conditions (Table 6), the electroporation efficiency was improved to 1.03 × 107 transformants/μg of DNA. To validate the electroporation efficiency, we performed a case study. Optimal electroporation condition for B. subtilis ZK. Optimized Factors Optimal Condition. Growth medium LBPS.

We used the pMUTIN4 to inactivate a gene (rapC). The rapC regulates the transcription of srfA [40] to influence the expression of lipopeptide antibiotics gene (surfactin) [41]. The gene may be involved in regulation of iturin A biosynthesis. A middle fragment of phosphatase gene (rapC) was cloned to pMUTIN4 plasmid and the recombinant plasmid was used to inactivate the rapC. Seventy nine transformants were obtained, four transformants of which were randomly selected and verified by PCR. As shown in Figure 5, the mutants have 1069 bp fragment with the P3 and P4 as the primers, indicating that rapC genes were inserted by the pMUTIN4 and that the optimized method provided enough efficiency for further genetics studies. When compared to the wild-type B. subtilis ZK, the rapC mutants exhibited markedly decrease (more than half) in iturin A production by shake flask fermentation in LB medium (Figure 6), suggesting that the rapC gene was closely related to the iturin A biosynthesis. This study provides the first demonstration of relationship between rapC and iturin A. However, further studies were required to confirm the relationship between rapC and iturin A production.
