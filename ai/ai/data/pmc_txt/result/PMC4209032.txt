Results Deletion of gliTresults in altered expression of over 200 genes involved in many functions in A. fumigatus As deletion of A. fumigatus gliT renders the strain sensitive to exogenous gliotoxin
[2, 15], to achieve a better understanding of the self-protection against gliotoxin provided by A. fumigatus gliT, high throughput RNA sequencing analysis was carried out. An average of 9312 transcripts were expressed in A. fumigatus wild-type and ∆gliT (available from the European Nucleotide Archive under accession ERP001382), which is in accordance with other RNA-seq investigations of the A. fumigatus transcriptome
[18, 22]. A comparison of A. fumigatus wild-type and ∆gliT revealed that the deletion of gliT resulted in the significant (p < 0.05) dysregulated expression of 208 genes, consisting of 175 up-regulated genes while 33 genes were significantly down-regulated (p < 0.05) (Figure 
1A, Additional file
1). The differentially regulated genes were classified according to the Functional Catalogue (FunCat)
[23] and KEGG pathways
[24] to identify the functions of these genes. Following deletion of gliT, 13 2nd level, 19 3rd level and 12 4th level FunCat categories were over-represented in the up-regulated gene set, compared to 3 2nd level, 10 3rd level and 3 4th level FunCat categories enriched in the down-regulated gene set (Additional file
2: Tables S1 and S2). Categories over-represented in the up-regulated gene set include; secondary metabolism, transport and detoxification, while genes involved in C-compound and carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in the down-regulated gene set (Figure 
2). Additionally, 11 KEGG pathways were over-represented in the up-regulated gene set, while genes involved in 13 KEGG pathways were enriched in the down-regulated gene set (Additional file
2: Tables S3 and S4). Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were over-represented in the up-regulated gene set, while amino acid metabolism was enriched in the down-regulated gene set. Genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis were enriched in both the up- and down-regulated gene sets.Figure 1

compared to wild-type. Gliotoxin exposure alters the regulation of hundreds of genes in both A. fumigatuswild-type and ∆gliT Following A. fumigatus wild-type exposure to exogenous gliotoxin, 164 genes were significantly differentially regulated (p <0.05) compared to control conditions (Figure 
1B). Of these 164 genes, 101 genes were up-regulated when A. fumigatus wild-type was exposed to gliotoxin, while 63 genes were down-regulated (Additional file
1). In contrast, when A. fumigatus ∆gliT was exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, 1,700 genes were significantly differentially regulated (p <0.05) (Figure 
1C), whereby expression of 508 genes was up-regulated in response to gliotoxin exposure and 1192 genes down-regulated (Additional file
1). Given the large transcriptomic remodelling observed in A. fumigatus ∆gliT following exogenous gliotoxin exposure, cell viability was assessed at 85%. Although a significant decrease (p =0.0019) in the cell viability of A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, compared with the methanol control (97%) (Additional file
2: Figure S1), gross cell death was not observed. Functional characterisation of differentially regulated genes in A. fumigatuswild-type and ∆gliTfollowing exogenous gliotoxin exposure In classifying the differentially regulated genes in A. fumigatus wild-type upon exposure to exogenous gliotoxin, 9 2nd level, 17 3rd level and 11 4th level FunCat categories, respectively, were over-represented in the up-regulated gene set compared to 12 2nd level, 17 3rd level and 8 4th level categories in the down-regulated gene set (Additional file
2: Tables S5 and S6). Comparatively, in A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, a greater number of FunCat categories were over-represented. Here, 24 2nd level, 23 3rd level and 12 4th level FunCat categories, respectively, were over-represented in the up-regulated gene set compared to 42 2nd level, 84 3rd level and 39 4th level categories in the down-regulated gene set (Additional file
2: Tables S7 and S8). A. fumigatus wild-type exposure to exogenous gliotoxin results in an over-representation of up-regulated expression of genes involved in secondary metabolism, transport (particularly siderophore-iron transport), detoxification processes and homeostasis processes as well as others (Figure 
3). Of the down-regulated genes, some of the categories which were enriched included amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and complex cofactor/cosubstrate/vitamin binding (Figure 
3). Loss of gliT in combination with exogenous gliotoxin exposure results in the dysregulation of a large number of processes within the cell. It resulted in an over-representation of up-regulated genes involved in stress response, ribosome biogenesis and translation, and of down-regulated genes involved in metabolism of cysteine, nitrogen, sulphur and selenium metabolism, RNA synthesis, transport (including siderophore-iron transport), homeostasis and cellular import (Figure 
4).Figure 3

In combination with the identified FunCat categories, 2 KEGG pathways were over-represented in the up-regulated gene set, and 13 KEGG pathways in the down-regulated gene set of A. fumigatus wild-type upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure were over-represented (Additional file
2: Tables S9 and S10). Pathways involved in xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism were enriched in the up-regulated gene set, while in the down-regulated gene set, pathways involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and amino acid metabolism are over-represented. In A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, 18 KEGG pathways were over-represented in the up-regulated gene set compared to 38 KEGG pathways in the down-regulated gene set (Additional file
2: Tables S11 and S12). Among the KEGG pathways over-represented in the up-regulated gene set were pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation and selenoamino acid metabolism. In the down-regulated gene set, some of the pathways over-represented included; biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, starch and sucrose metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Exogenous gliotoxin causes dysregulation of gliotoxin biosynthesis cluster gene expression in both A. fumigatuswild-type and ∆gliT Close inspection of the 13-gene gliotoxin biosynthesis cluster
[2, 3], revealed that exogenous gliotoxin caused the dysregulated expression of a number of gliotoxin biosynthetic genes in both A. fumigatus wild-type and ∆gliT (Table 
1). Upon exposure to exogenous gliotoxin, five out of the 13 genes in the cluster were significantly up-regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type. Expression of A. fumigatus gliZ was up-regulated log2 3.2-fold, gliP log2 6.2 fold, while gliA and gliF were up-regulated log2 10- and log2 6.7-fold, respectively. Expression of gliT, which confers protection against exogenous gliotoxin
[2, 15], was up-regulated log2 9.2-fold. Increased expression of the remaining genes in the gliotoxin biosynthetic cluster was also observed in A. fumigatus wild-type upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure, however altered expression was not significant.Table 1

Upon A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposure to exogenous gliotoxin, dysregulated expression of gliotoxin biosynthetic genes was also observed (Table 
1). As in A. fumigatus wild-type, gliP, gliA and gliF expression was also up-regulated in ∆gliT upon exogenous gliotoxin addition. A. fumigatus gliP was up-regulated log2 3.4-fold, gliA was up-regulated log2 8.5-fold and A. fumigatus gliF was up-regulated log2 4.7-fold. Additionally, A. fumigatus gliM was up-regulated log2 6.9-fold in A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, which was not observed in A. fumigatus wild-type upon gliotoxin exposure. Of the remaining gliotoxin biosynthetic genes, while not significant, with the exception of A. fumigatus gliZ and gliI which did not exhibit altered expression, and gliJ which appeared to undergo down-regulated expression, increased expression of the remaining genes was observed in A. fumigatus ∆gliT upon exposure to exogenous gliotoxin. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the expression of A. fumigatus gliZ confirmed the up-regulation in A. fumigatus wild-type exposed to exogenous gliotoxin compared to the control, however it also showed increased gliZ expression in ∆gliT in response to gliotoxin (Figure 
5), which was not observed in the RNA-seq analysis, possibly due to the sensitivities of the different techniques. qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of A. fumigatus gliA in both A. fumigatus wild-type and A. fumigatus ∆gliT in both the absence and presence of exogenous gliotoxin confirmed the up-regulation in response to exogenous gliotoxin (Figure

[2, 9]. Moreover, feeding experiments with [13C]-phenylalanine herein confirm, for the first time, that gliotoxin biosynthesis is actually induced by exogenous gliotoxin. A significant increase (p =0.0295) was observed in the amount of [13C]-gliotoxin detectable in the wild-type A. fumigatus Af293 culture supernatants following exogenous gliotoxin addition compared to the methanol control (Figure

Exogenous gliotoxin results in down-regulation of secondary metabolite gene cluster expression in A. fumigatus∆gliT FunCat classification of the altered gene expression in A. fumigatus wild-type and ∆gliT, respectively, revealed an enrichment of genes involved in secondary metabolism upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure. In A. fumigatus wild-type, expression of 16 genes which was up-regulated, and that of 3 genes down-regulated in response to exogenous gliotoxin, were classified by 2nd level of FunCat as being involved in secondary metabolism (Additional file
2: Tables S5 and S6). A larger number of genes were classified in this category in A. fumigatus ∆gliT in response to exogenous gliotoxin presence, where 22 up-regulated genes and 103 down-regulated genes were observed (Additional file
2: Tables S7 and S8). A closer inspection of some of the secondary metabolite genes clusters revealed significant alterations in the expression of genes in the helvolic biosynthesis cluster
[25] and the “supercluster” on chromosome 8 which encodes the biosynthetic pathways of a number of secondary metabolites, including fumitremorgin B, fumagillin and pseurotin A

[25]. In A. fumigatus wild-type, exogenous gliotoxin results in the significant up-regulation of 2 genes, A. fumigatus osc3 (log2 3.28-fold) and sdrI (log2 3.22-fold) (Table 
2). Conversely, in A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, osc3 was significantly down-regulated (log2 6.3-fold) along with a predicted O-methyltransferase, AFUA_4G14580, which is significantly down-regulated (log2 2.7-fold) (Table 
2). In addition to this, expression of cyp5081B1 is completely abrogated in A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin (Table 
2). qRT-PCR analysis of A. fumigatus osc3 confirmed the observed down-regulation in A. fumigatus ∆gliT and up-regulation of A. fumigatus osc3 in A. fumigatus wild-type exposed to exogenous gliotoxin (Figure 
5). Of the 69 genes in the “supercluster” on chromosome 8, expression of two genes is significantly down-regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type in response to exogenous gliotoxin (Table 
2). However, in A. fumigatus ∆gliT, when exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, expression of 26 genes from the “supercluster” was down-regulated (Table 
2). Closer inspection of the fumitremorgin B biosynthetic genes revealed that expression of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), A. fumigatus ftmA
[29], was significantly down-regulated (log2 2.78-fold) in A. fumigatus wild-type in exogenous gliotoxin presence (Table 
2). While in A. fumigatus ∆gliT, ftmA (log2 6.65-fold), ftmC (log2 5.68-fold), ftmD (log2 5.87-fold), ftmG (log2 6.52-fold) and ftmI (log2 1.45-fold) expression was significantly down-regulated, and ftmE expression was completely inhibited in response to exogenous gliotoxin (Table 
2). qRT-PCR analysis of A. fumigatus ftmA confirmed decreased expression in both wild-type and ∆gliT following exposure to exogenous gliotoxin (Figure 
5). Determination of the levels of the fumitremorgins and associated compounds in A. fumigatus wild-type and ∆gliT cultured in secondary metabolite-inducing conditions (96 h in Czpaeks-Dox Broth) revealed significant alterations in the levels of a number of cognate metabolites. Specifically, brevianamide F levels were significantly increased in A. fumigatus ∆gliT compared to wild-type (p =0.0243), while the levels of both tryprostatin A and tryprostatin B were significantly decreased (p =0.008 and p =0.0453) in A. fumigatus ∆gliT compared to wild-type (Figure 
7). There was no significant difference determined in the level of fumitremorgin C between A. fumigatus wild-type and ∆gliT (Figure 
7).Figure 7

There was no significant difference in fumitremorgin C (C) levels, while brevianamide F (D) levels were significantly increased (* p =0.0243) in ∆gliT compared to wild-type. Tryprostatin B (E) and tryprostatin A (F) levels were significantly reduced in ∆gliT compared to wild-type (* p =0.0453 and ** p =0.008, respectively). There was no significant dysregulation of the fumagillin biosynthetic genes in A. fumigatus wild-type in exogenous gliotoxin presence. However, when A. fumigatus ∆gliT was exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, expression of 12 fumagillin biosynthetic genes in the cluster was significantly down-regulated (p <0.05) (Table 
2). Some of the down-regulated genes include a polyketide synthase (PKS) (A. fumigatus fma-PKS)
[30] and a putative PKS (AFUA_8G00490)
[27] which were down-regulated log2 7.20- and log2 5.65-fold, respectively, A. fumigatus metAP/fpaII expression was down-regulated log2 5.20-fold and fma-TC/fmaA was down-regulated log2 8.37-fold. The decreased expression of A. fumigatus fma-PKS in A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (Figure 
5). As was the case for fumitremorgin B and fumagillin, none of the pseurotin A biosynthetic genes were differentially regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type in exogenous gliotoxin presence (Table 
2). However, in A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, with the exception of AFUA_8G00570, expression of all of the pseurotin A biosynthetic genes was significantly down-regulated (Table 
2). Expression of AFUA_8G00530 and A. fumigatus psoA/nrps14, the PKS-NRPS hybrid
[28], were down-regulated log2 7.45- and log2 5.79-fold respectively, while A. fumigatus psoC, psoD and elfB
[31] expression was down-regulated log2 7.41-, log2 6.78- and log2 8.21-fold respectively. qRT-PCR confirmed the decreased expression of A. fumigatus psoA/nrps14 in A. fumigatus ∆gliT upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure (Figure 
5). Relevantly, under secondary metabolite inducing growth conditions, production of fumagillin and pseurotin A was significantly reduced (p =0.0471 and p =0.0297, respectively) in A. fumigatus ∆gliT compared to wild-type (Figure 
7). The methyltransferase, laeA, is a global regulator of secondary metabolism in A. fumigatus, which fully or partially regulates expression of multiple secondary metabolite gene clusters, including those encoding gliotoxin, helvolic acid, pseurotin A, fumagillin and fumitremorgin biosynthesis
[26, 27, 32, 33]. Although dysregulation of secondary metabolite gene expression in A. fumigatus ∆gliT compared to A. fumigatus was observed after exposure to gliotoxin, laeA expression was not differentially regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type in exogenous gliotoxin presence, but was significantly down-regulated (p =0.015; log21.31-fold) in A. fumigatus ∆gliT under identical conditions. Although significantly down-regulated, it was outside the cut-off of log21.5-fold change. qRT-PCR analysis for A. fumigatus laeA did not show any differential regulation in either A. fumigatus wild-type or A. fumigatus ∆gliT when challenged with exogenous gliotoxin (Figure 
5). This suggests that laeA expression is not solely responsible for the altered expression of secondary metabolite genes, particularly in A. fumigatus ∆gliT when it is exposed to exogenous gliotoxin. Expression of A. fumigatus gliT in ∆laeA
[32] exposed to exogenous gliotoxin for 3 h was analysed. A. fumigatus gliT expression increased following exogenous gliotoxin exposure in ∆laeA (Figure 
8) indicating that loss of laeA does not affect gliT expression in the presence of exogenous gliotoxin. Recently, the global regulatory velvet gene, A. fumigatus veA, has been implicated in secondary metabolite biosynthesis regulation, particularly with respect to gliotoxin
[20] and fumagillin
[22]. However, from the data presented here, A. fumigatus veA is not differentially regulated in either A. fumigatus wild-type or A. fumigatus ∆gliT in exogenous gliotoxin presence. A. fumigatus gliT expression in A. fumigatus ∆veA
[34] was assessed following exposure to exogenous gliotoxin and was increased in ∆veA in the presence of exogenous gliotoxin (Figure 
8). A. fumigatus gliT expression was higher in the methanol control (Figure 
8) compared to the other mutants under the same conditions. Expression of A. fumigatus gliT in ∆veA grown in media only was lower than the methanol control (data not shown), suggesting that methanol induced increased gliT expression in A. fumigatus ∆veA. The increased gliT expression in A. fumigatus ∆veA following methanol addition was only observed in this strain, and was not observed in other deletion strains generated in this background (e.g. ∆laeA).Figure 8

[27]. As was the case in A. fumigatus laeA, expression of A. fumigatus gliT increased in these mutants following exogenous gliotoxin exposure (Figure 
8) indicating that loss of production of these metabolites does not affect gliT expression. Siderophore-iron transport and siderophore biosynthesis is affected by exogenous gliotoxin and to a greater extent in A. fumigatus∆gliT Functional classification of the differentially regulated gene set revealed an enrichment of genes involved in siderophore-iron transport in both A. fumigatus wild-type and A. fumigatus ∆gliT when exposed to exogenous gliotoxin. In A. fumigatus wild-type exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, expression of six siderophore-iron transport genes was up-regulated, while in A. fumigatus ∆gliT, expression of two siderophore-iron transport genes was up-regulated and 12 genes are down-regulated (Table 
3). A. fumigatus sidF was de novo expressed in A. fumigatus wild-type upon exposure to exogenous gliotoxin. Expression of A. fumigatus mirD was up-regulated in both A. fumigatus wild-type (log2 2.57-fold) and A. fumigatus ∆gliT (log2 3.07-fold) in exogenous gliotoxin presence. Interestingly, three genes that were significantly up-regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type exposed to exogenous gliotoxin were significantly down-regulated in A. fumigatus ∆gliT, when challenged with exogenous gliotoxin. A. fumigatus fre7 was significantly up-regulated log2 2.80-fold in A. fumigatus wild-type, but significantly down-regulated log2 2.77-fold in A. fumigatus ∆gliT. AFUA_3G13670 and AFUA_3G13700, significantly up-regulated log2 7.03- and log2 7.62-fold respectively, in A. fumigatus wild-type in exogenous gliotoxin presence, were significantly down-regulated upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure log2 7.06- and log2 7.82-fold in A. fumigatus ∆gliT. Expression of AFUA_3G13700 in both A. fumigatus wild-type and ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure

The observed differential regulation of genes involved in siderophore-iron transport prompted us to review whether expression of siderophore biosynthetic genes
[35] was affected by exogenous gliotoxin in A. fumigatus wild-type and A. fumigatus ∆gliT. Indeed we have already noted that sidF expression, a transacylase that transfers anhydromevalonyl to hydroxyornithine during extracellular siderophore biosynthesis
[36], was activated in A. fumigatus wild-type following exogenous gliotoxin exposure. In A. fumigatus ∆gliT, expression of two genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis was differentially regulated in response to exogenous gliotoxin (Table 
3). A. fumigatus sidH, involved in providing the anhydromevalonyl-CoA moiety for extracellular siderophore biosynthesis
[37], was de novo expressed while A. fumigatus sidA, which is required for the first step of siderophore biosynthesis
[38], was significantly up-regulated log2 2.16-fold (p =0.0005). qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of A. fumigatus sidH confirmed the increased expression in A. fumigatus ∆gliT following exogenous gliotoxin exposure (Figure 
5). Nitrogen metabolism is down-regulated in A. fumigatus∆gliTin response to exogenous gliotoxin In A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, expression of 55 genes involved in nitrogen metabolism was down-regulated, while expression of 4 genes was up-regulated (Table 
4). In contrast, 3 genes were up-regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type and 8 genes were down-regulated in response to exogenous gliotoxin (Table 
4). In A. fumigatus ∆gliT, expression of two genes, cyp5081B1, a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase already mentioned in helvolic acid biosynthesis
[25], and AFUA_6G00412, predicted to have amino acid transmembrane transporter activity
[39] was completely abrogated in response to exogenous gliotoxin. Expression of A. fumigatus optB and cpsI, which are induced when BSA is the sole nitrogen source
[40], was down-regulated log2 5.399- and log2 3.98-fold, respectively, in A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin. The decreased expression of A. fumigatus optB in A. fumigatus ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 
5). When utilising complex nitrogen sources, A. fumigatus secretes proteases, and increases expression of amidase, aminotransferase, and amino acid and peptide transporter genes
[40, 41]. These secreted proteases are regulated by a conserved regulatory factor, prtT
[40, 41], which is decreased log2 3.66-fold in expression in ∆gliT but unchanged in wild-type following exogenous gliotoxin exposure. Indeed, further examination revealed decreased expression of 14 proteases, 3 amidases and 7 amino acid and peptide transporters in ∆gliT exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, while expression of one amidase, AFUA_5G09140, was increased log2 3.37-fold (Table 
4). Expression of both nitrate transporters, crnA and nrtB, which are predicted gene pairs
[42], was significantly down-regulated (log2 2.689- and log2 4.504-fold) in A. fumigatus ∆gliT upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure. Expression of a number of genes with predicted involvement in the oxidation-reduction process was down-regulated in A. fumigatus ∆gliT only following exogenous gliotoxin exposure. Among these genes were nitronate monooxygenases (AFUA_2G17430 and AFUA_4G07940 down-regulated log2 4.444- and log2 2.304-fold) and copper ion binding domain genes (AFUA_1G13440, AFUA_5G01470 and AFUA_5G07360; down-regulated log21.692-, log2 4.125- and log2 3.948-fold, respectively). In A. fumigatus wild-type exposed to exogenous gliotoxin, two predicted carbon-nitrogen ligases, AFUA_4G04160 and AFUA_4G04170, were down-regulated log2 1.926- and log2 2.622-fold, respectively. These carbon-nitrogen ligases are not differentially regulated in A. fumigatus ∆gliT upon exogenous gliotoxin exposure, suggesting that loss of gliT may hinder the down-regulation of these genes in response to gliotoxin.Table 4

Exogenous gliotoxin exposure alters gene expression involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation in A. fumigatus∆gliTwhile transcription related genes are down-regulated Dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis and translation was observed in A. fumigatus ∆gliT following exogenous gliotoxin exposure, whereby expression of 20 genes was up-regulated and two genes down-regulated (Table 
5). Of the 20 genes up-regulated in A. fumigatus ∆gliT in response to exogenous gliotoxin, 7 genes encode 60S ribosomal proteins and two encode 40S ribosomal proteins, all of which are increased log21.5-1.7-fold in expression (Table 
5). The two genes down-regulated in response to exogenous gliotoxin in A. fumigatus ∆gliT have already been mentioned as secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes. A. fumigatus metAP in the fumagillin biosynthetic gene cluster
[30] was down-regulated log2 4.340-fold and A. fumigatus elfB in the pseurotin A biosynthetic gene cluster was down-regulated log2 7.265-fold
[27, 31]. In contrast to A. fumigatus ∆gliT, only two genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation were up-regulated in A. fumigatus wild-type exposed to exogenous gliotoxin (Table 
5). AFUA_5G07340 was up-regulated log2 1.909-fold while AFUA_2G12150 was up-regulated log2 2.417-fold. In addition to the dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis and translation, 44 genes involved in transcription were also down-regulated in A. fumigatus ∆gliT in response to exogenous gliotoxin, compared to 3 down-regulated genes in wild-type exposed to exogenous gliotoxin (Table 
6). A proteomic investigation of A. fumigatus ∆gliTATCC26933 reflected this alteration in translation whereby 6 proteins were uniquely expressed or increased in abundance and 15 proteins were absent or decreased in abundance when exposed to exogenous gliotoxin (Tables 
7 and
8). Loss of GliT negatively impacts expression of genes involved in transcription processes and results in significantly decreased transcription of genes in the presence of exogenous gliotoxin, culminating in disruption of translation.Table 5
