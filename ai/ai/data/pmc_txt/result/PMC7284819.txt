3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Isolation and Characterization of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A The Lake Baikal endemic mollusk Benedictia baicalensis [37] was sampled (12× samples with five specimens, each) at a depth of 50 and 100 m in February 2016 at Lake Baikal in Bolshiye Koty village (51°54′19″ N 105°4′31″ E, western shore of Lake Baikal) and actinobacteria were isolated as described in the materials and methods section. Several actinobacteria-like colonies with similar morphology were found in three samples from 50 m and two samples from 100 m depth. After re-plating on fresh MS medium, all five isolates were noticed to contain two different species (Figure 2A). One of them demonstrated surface growth with pale orange colonies and did not form aerial mycelium and spores (Figure 2B). Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, this bacterium was identified as a Rhodococcus sp. designated as IB201691-2A2 (Supplementary Figure S1). The second bacterium has substrate growth typical for streptomycetes, forms white spores, and produces dark-brown pigment (Figure 2C). The 16S rRNA gene phylogeny analysis placed the strain into the genus Streptomyces and it was named Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A (Supplementary Figure S2). Gene sequences of 16S rRNA of Rhodococcus sp. IB201691-2A2 and Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A specimens isolated from different samples were identical (data not shown). Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A is closely related to S. ederensis NBRC 15410, producing moenomycins and S. umbrinus NBRC 13091 producing phaeochromycin and diumycins (moenomycin derivatives). Both strains were isolated from soil and are heterotypic synonyms of phaeochromycin-producing S. phaeochromogenes (Supplementary Figure S2) [48,49]. The S. phaeochromogenes strain was originally discovered as a producer of angucycline PD116198 [7]. In this study, we focused on Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A strain. 3.2. Production and Isolation of Baikalomycins For biological activity screening Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A was cultured in nine different liquid media at three temperatures (13, 28, and 37 °C) and extracts were tested against four test-cultures, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeast (Supplementary Table S3). The strain was found to produce compounds active only against B. subtilis. SM27N medium and 28 °C conditions were preferable for accumulation of these bioactive metabolites, as seen from the largest inhibition zone (Supplementary Table S3). The crude extract of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A grown in SM27N was analyzed by high-resolution LC-MS and dereplicated using the Dictionary of Natural Products database. Two known compounds rabelomycin (1) and 5-hydroxy-rabelomycin (2) were identified, with the former being the major product of the strain (Figure 3A,B; Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). Rabelomycin, a well-known shunt product in the biosynthesis of angucyclines, was also co-isolated together with vineomycins from extracts of S. matensis subsp. vineus and himalomycins A and B from Streptomyces sp. B6921 [4,25,50]. Besides these two compounds, several peaks with characteristics for angucyclines absorption spectra and m/z ranging from 330 to 620 (in negative mode) are present in the extract of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A. However, we were not able to identify these compounds within the Dictionary of Natural Products. Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A was cultivated in 10 L of the SM27N medium and metabolites were extracted, giving 2.04 g of a crude extract. Metabolites were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and the targeted compounds were purified by the preparative HPLC. Five pure compounds were obtained (with 80–85% purity): Rabelomycin (1) (6.5 mg), 5-Hydroxy-rabelomycin (2) (1.8 mg), baikalomycin A (3) (RT 6.9 min, 0.9 mg), baikalomycin B (4) (RT 9.1 min, 1.1 mg) and baikalomycin C (5) (RT 12.8 min, 0.7 mg) (Figure 3A,B; Supplementary Figures S3–S5). 3.3. Structure Elucidation of Baikalomycins The structures of rabelomycin (1) and 5-hydroxy-rabelomycin (2) were confirmed by the comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data to the previously reported data (Figure 3B; Supplementary Table S4) [51,52]. Baikalomycin A (3) was obtained as a pale-yellow solid (purity > 80 mol%, according to 1H NMR, Supplementary Figure S6). The molecular formula of C25H30O11 and m/z 487.1634 [M-H2O-H]− (calc. m/z 487.1604 [M-H2O-H]−) was determined on the basis of HRESIMS ( High-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry) data, indicating 11 degrees of unsaturation (Figure 3B; Supplementary Figure S5). The compound exhibited UV absorption at 240, 285, and 355 nm. The analysis of 1H and 2D HSQC (Heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy) and HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation) spectra revealed the presence of 25 carbon atoms, 12 quaternary carbons, five methine, six methylene, two methyl carbons and two ortho-coupled aromatic protons at δH 7.84 (dd, 8 Hz, 0.6 Hz, H-10) and δH 7.58 (d, 8 Hz, H-11) which indicate a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. Key correlations in the HMBC spectrum from H-11 to C-7, C-7a, C-8, C-9, C-12, from H-6 to C-6a, C-12a, C-7, C-12, from H-5 to C-4a, C-12b, C-6a and from H-4 to C-4a, C-12b revealed the presence of the well-known aquayamycin-type core structure (ring A–D) substituted at position C-9 (Figure 4A; Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Figures S6–S10). However, ring B is found to be fully saturated, which is only known for a few cases, e.g., moromycins A and B, grecocyclines, and N05WA963 A–C [19,20,53]. The 13C values, ranging from 70–80 ppm for C-4a, C-6a, C-12a, and C-12b indicated the presence of hydroxy groups whereas C-5 (δC 30.0, δH 1.65 and 2.21) and C-6 (δC 26.0, δH 2.18 and 2.47) were identified as CH2 groups. As known for the aquayamycin compounds, ring A bears a hydroxy and methyl group at C-3. The absolute configuration at this position has been determined as R in several previously isolated angucyclines with a similar biosynthetic origin, e.g., in urdamycin or saquayamycin [11,54]. Therefore, the configuration in baikalomycins A as well as in B is likely to be the same. In addition, one anomeric proton at δH 4.77 (δC 74.0), one methine proton at δH 3.22 (δC 72.5), two methylene signals at δH 1.43/2.20 (δC 33.0) and δH 1.63/2.11 (δC 33.5), and one methyl signal at δH 1.32 (δC 18.5) confirm the presence of a 2,3,6-tridesoxy-hexose unit. As known for other aquayamycin natural products, the sugar was attached to the aglycone at C-9, which was supported by HMBC correlations from H-1′ to C-8, C-9, C-10, as well as from H-2′ to C-9 (Figure 4A). Due to the large coupling constants of H-1’ (11 Hz), H-4′ (11, 9 Hz), and H-5′ (9 Hz), the respective protons must be in axial positions and therefore the sugar should be β-amicetose. The respective ROESY (Rotating frame Overhause Effect Spectroscopy) crosspeaks provided further proof for the given structure (Figure 4B). We assume that the sugar is D configured, as only the β-d-form of amicetose has been found among the C-glycosides in aquayamycin-like compounds so far [9]. Due to the fact that all substances could only be isolated in very small quantities and should still be subjected to biologic testing, a hydrolysis of the glycosides to determine the absolute configuration of the sugar components by means of optical rotation was not possible. Baikalomycin B (4) was isolated as a pale-yellow solid (purity > 85 mol% according to 1H NMR, Supplementary Figure S11) with the molecular formula C31H40O13 and m/z 601.2332 [M-H2O-H]− (calc. m/z 601.2285 [M-H2O-H]−), suggesting 12 degrees of unsaturation (Figure 3B; Supplementary Figure S5). Similar to (3), this compound showed absorption at 240, 285, and 355 nm. NMR data of 1H and 13C largely resembles the data of (3), however, with one major difference. The presence of an additional anomeric proton at δH 4.80 (δC 99.5), together with one methine proton at δH 3.15, two methylene groups at δH 1.76/1.84 and δH 1.74/1.78, and one methyl group at δH 1.18 indicate the presence of a second 2,3,6-tridesoxy-hexose moiety, which is O-glycosidically linked to the first sugar. HMBC correlations from H-1′′ to C-4′ confirm the connectivity of both sugar units (Figure 4B; Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Figures S11–S15). The second sugar moiety was as well identified as amicetose due to the large diaxial coupling JH4′′H5′′ 9 Hz. Although the small coupling constant of H-1′′ (JHH = 2.5 Hz) indicates the α-anomer in this case. Most probably, the α-amicetose is L configured as it was found for most of the terminal, O-glycosidically bound sugars in aquayamycin-like natural products [9]. Baikalomycin C (5) was obtained as a yellow solid (purity > 80 mol% according to 1H NMR, Supplementary Figure S16) and showed m/z 579.1887 [M-H]− (calc. m/z 579.187184 [M-H]−) that corresponds to molecular formula C31H32O11 indicating 16 degrees of unsaturation (Figure 3B; Supplementary Figure S5). The UV absorption at 228, 258, 294, and 441 nm suggests an increased conjugated system compared to (3) and (4). Analysis of 1H NMR, HSQC, and HMBC spectra revealed an anthraquinone core formed by ring B, C, and D (Figure 4B; Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Figures S16–S21). This finding was concluded from the ortho-coupled aromatic proton signals at δH 7.91 (d, 8 Hz, H-10) and δH 7.86 (d, 8 Hz, H-11) and HMBC correlations from H-10 to C-8, C-11a and from H-11 to C-7a, C-9, and C-12. A second ortho-coupled pair of protons at δH 7.76 (d, 8 Hz, H-5) and δH 7.80 (d, 8 Hz, H-6) confirm the presence of another aromatic ring. HMBC correlations from H-6 to C-12a and C-7 and from H-5 to C6a establish the connection of this ring to the quinone ring C. In contrast to (3) and (4), the former ring A was opened between C-1 and C-12b leading to a phenolic hydroxyl group at C-12b (δC 162.56) and a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl butanoic acid side chain attached to C-4a (Figure 3B). Similar to baikalomycin A and B, the C-glycosidic sugar attached to the aglycone at C-9 was identified as β-d-amicetose due to comparable chemical shift values and coupling constants for H-1′, H-4′ and H-5′ (Supplementary Table S5). An additional anomeric signal at δH 5.40 and δC 96.21 indicates a second O-glycosidic bonded sugar which is supported by corresponding HMBC correlations from H-1′′ to C-4′ (Supplementary Table S5). This sugar consists of two olefinic protons δH 6.98 (H-2′′), 6.05 (H-3′′), one methine proton δH 4.61, a methyl group at δH 1.32 and a carbonyl signal at δC 198.82 (C-4′′) and was thus identified as aculose. The small coupling constant of H-1′′ (3.5 Hz) is consistent with the α-anomer (Supplementary Table S5). Until today, only α-l-aculose was found in aquayamycin-type natural products, which let us assume that we have the sugar moiety [9]. The aglycone of baikalomycin C is the same as in amicenomycin B and himalomycin A [22,25]. Thus, the absolute configuration at C-3 can be assigned as R. Despite the similarity to aquayamycin-type compounds, baikalomycins A and B possess an uncommon aglycone (hydroxy groups at C-6a and C-12a) that has been found in only one other angucycline, namely a derivative of PD 116198 isolated from S. phaeochromogenes WP 3688 [7]. As opposed to this, several angucyclinones and glycosylated angucyclines with epoxide function at these positions are known, including simocyclinones and grecocycline A [53,55]. Compounds with one hydroxyl group at C-6a or C-12a, like panglimycins A-B, saccharothrixmicine B, and kiamycin are also described [56,57,58]. The standalone case, however, is grecocycline B with a thiol group at C-6a and hydroxyl group at C-12a. Importantly, we were not able to find tri- and tetra-saccharides of baikalomycins in the extracts of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A. The stereochemistry of the chiral centers in ring B of baikalomycins A and B remains uncertain. The spatial positions of the hydroxy groups at C-4a and C-12b were concluded to be cis as it has been described for all comparable angucyclines beforehand. However, the chiral centers C-6a and C-12a of the new aglycone could not be elucidated due to the lack of reliable signals for the hydroxyl protons even in DMSO-d6. Therefore, respective correlations involving the hydroxyl protons could not be found in the ROESY spectra. 3.4. Biological Activities of Baikalomycins Rabelomycins and baikalomycins were tested for antibacterial and anticancer activities. The compounds 1, 2, and 5 showed moderate and weak activity against Staphylococcus carnosus DSMZ 20501 and Mycobacterium smegmatis DSMZ 43286 (Table 1). Also, 1, 2, and 4 were moderately active against Erwinia persicina. Anticancer activities were determined against the human cancer cell lines A549 (lung carcinoma), Huh7.5 (hepatocellular carcinoma), MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), and SW620 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) by MTT assay [59]. Baikalomycins A and B showed moderate to weak effects on A549 and MCF7 cell viability (Table 2). The compounds 1, 2, and 5 exerted a more potent activity with IC50 values in the low micromolar range on all four cell lines (Table 2, Supplementary Figure S22A). A549 cells were chosen to further analyze the potential antiproliferative actions in an impedance-based assay. Antiproliferative effects correlated with activities observed in A549 cells in the MTT assay: while 3, 4, and 5 showed no antiproliferative effects (data not shown), 1 and, to a greater extent, 2 reduced cell proliferation in concentrations showing no effect in the MTT assays (cell viability > 80% after 48 h treatment) (Supplementary Figure S22B). 3.5. Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A Genome Sequencing and Analysis The genome of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A has been sequenced and assembled into 109 contigs with an overall size of 11,410,308 bp (including 61,648 undefined nucleotides). The G+C content was found to be 70% that is typical for streptomycetes. The largest contig is 1155 kbp. The genome of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A consists of a single chromosome, based on the sequence coverage, and contains 10,023 predicted CDSs, 5 rRNA gene clusters, 86 tRNA, and one transfer-messenger RNA genes. AntiSMASH analysis revealed the presence of 38 gene clusters potentially involved in secondary metabolites biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S6). The genome is enriched with the genes for siderophores production, including those typical for actinobacteria desferrioxamine and two aerobactin-like siderophores biosynthetic gene clusters, as well as a more unusual scabichelin biosynthetic gene cluster, originally found in S. scabies [60]. The enrichment of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A with siderophores encoding gene clusters is not unusual, since the iron content of the Lake Baikal water is relatively low [61]. Biosynthetic products could also be clearly predicted for three terpene gene clusters, such as hopene (cluster 7), albaflavenone (cluster 13), and earthy-musty odor-causing 2-methylisoborneol (cluster 22) [62,63,64]. 3.6. Identification of Baikalomycins Biosynthetic Gene Cluster The genome of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A contains only one gene cluster encoding type II PKS and oligosaccharides biosynthesis enzymes that could be putatively involved in biosynthesis of baikalomycins (Figure 5A; Supplementary Table S6). This cluster, further designated as the bai gene cluster, is predicted to be 34 kbp in length and is located at the 3′ edge of scaffold00031. It encodes 27 complete and 1 incomplete CDSs. The BLAST analysis of the incomplete open reading frame (ORF) revealed that it is coding for putative acyl-CoA carboxylase with the closest homologue being SchP1 from Sch47554/47555 biosynthesis [29]. The search within the genome of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A identified a missing part of the acyl-CoA carboxylase gene at the 5′ edge of scaffold00038 (Supplementary Figure S23). We performed multiple sequence alignment of bai, sch (Sch47554/47555 from Streptomyces sp. SCC-2136), saq (saquayamycin from S. nodosus ATCC4899), sqn (saquayamycin from Streptomyces sp. KY40-1), spr (saprolomycin from Streptomyces sp. TK08046) and gcn (grincamycin from S. lusitanus SCSIO LR32) gene clusters (Figure 5B). This allowed determining the core of the bai cluster defined by genes baiA10 encoding putative NADP-oxidase and baiA12 methylmalonyl-CoA carboxylase. The genes within this region are present in all six closely related type II PKS-encoding clusters. The core of the bai gene cluster shares a 96.4% nucleotide sequence identity with the sch cluster in pairwise alignment (Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure S23). At the same time, this number is lower for the other four related clusters. The high degree of similarity shows a close evolutional relationship between the mentioned biosynthetic genes that is reflected in the high similarity of produced compounds (Supplementary Figure S24). 3.6.1. Genes Putatively Involved in Biosynthesis of Aglycone Core We attempted to predict the function of Bai enzymes in the assembly of baikalomycins. Genes baiA1, baiA2, and baiA3 show high sequence similarity to saqA, B, C, sqn H, I, J and SchP6, 7, 8, encoding components of the “minimal PKS” complex (Supplementary Table S7): BaiA1 ketoacyl synthase α, BaiA2 ketoacyl synthase β (chain length factor CLF), and BaiA3 acyl carrier protein (ACP). These enzymes catalyze the synthesis of the nascent decaketide chain by repetitive condensation of one acetyl-CoA and nine malonyl-CoA units. BaiA4, showed high similarity to SchP5 (98%) and UrdD (86%, urdamycin ketoreductase from S. fradiae Tü2717) ketoreductases, responsible for the first reduction of the nascent polyketide chain at the C-9 position [29,65]. Two genes baiA5/A6 code for putative cyclases/aromatases performing cyclization of the polyketide chain into the benz[a]anthracene structure. BaiA5/A6 resembles SchP4/P9 (99%/99%) and UrdF/L (73%/87%). baiA7 encodes a close homologue of SrpB (77%) and UrdE (78%) proteins. UrdE is an oxygenase catalyzing hydroxylation of an angucycline aglycone at the C-12 position [66]. Lastly, baiA8 is encodes a second oxygenase enzyme with high identity to UrdM (85%) and SprI (88%) and seems to be involved in the hydroxylation in C-4a and C-12b [67]. Additionally, baikalomycins A and B bear hydroxy groups at positions C-6a and C-12a and lack C-5/C-6 double bond. A complete non-aromatic ring B has been rarely found in angucycline structures and thus there is no experimental data on how it is formed. It can be only assumed that hydroxylation of C-6a/C-12a and reduction of the double bond is catalyzed by oxygenase-reductase BaiA7, as it was hypothesized for kiamycin biosynthesis [68]. However, another scenario cannot be excluded. Two genes on the left edge of the bai cluster, baiA9 and baiA10, code for putative flavin-oxidoreductase and NADPH-dependent reductase, respectively. The latter enzyme might provide the activity needed to reduce the double bond at C-5/C-6, when the former can be involved in processing of keto groups at C-6a/C-12a. Lastly, baiA11 codes for putative 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase, possibly involved in activation of ACP, and baiA12 encodes putative methylmalonyl-CoA carboxyltransferase, that might participate in precursors supply. 3.6.2. Genes Putatively Involved in Deoxysugars Biosynthesis and Attachment Two deoxysugars are present in the structure of baikalomycins: amicetose, in d- and l-configuration, and l-aculose. The bai gene cluster contains ten genes predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of deoxysugars. Four enzymes, required for biosynthesis of the common precursor NDP-4-keto-2,6-dideoxy-d-glucose, are encoded by baiS1 (glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase), baiS2 (dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase), baiS5 (NDP-hexose 2,3-dehydratase), and baiS6 (glucose-fructose oxidoreductase) (Figure 5A; Supplementary Table S7). Subsequently, the generation of d-amicetose is accomplished through the action of BaiS4 (dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose transaminase) and BaiS3 (dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose-4-dehydrogenase). Lastly, epimerization at C-5′ would lead to formation of l-amicetose. BaiS7 has a high homology to UrdZ1 (71%) dTDP-4- dehydrorhamnose-3-epimerase. The biosynthetic steps in the l-aculose formation were previously described for aclacinomycins and grincamycins [27,69]. In both cases l-aculose derives from rhodinose by the action of flavin-dependent oxidoreductases AknOx and GcnQ. Catalysis is performed in two steps: first, rhodinose is converted to cinerulose by oxidation at the C-4” position, followed by dehydrogenation to form double bond between C2” and C3” [69]. Unlike in the AknOx performed reaction, in the case of GcnQ no cinerulose intermediate has been observed [27]. Based on similarity with GcnQ and AknOx, it can be assumed that the flavin-dependent oxidoreductases SprY and SqnQ convert rhodinose to acculose in the case of saprolmycins and saquayamycins biosynthesis [28,31]. Corresponding genes are located at the 3′ edge of respective gene clusters downstream of the putative methylmalonyl-CoA carboxylase gene. In both, the sch and bai clusters, a gene encoding flavin-dependent oxidoreductase is missing in this region (Figure 5A). A BLAST search against Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A genome using AknOx and GcnQ sequences as query resulted in one positive hit with high amino acid sequence identity (57.3% and 67.9%, respectively). The corresponding gene, 91_A2_44060 (baiS8), is located just upstream of initially defined borders of the bai cluster (Figure 5A; Supplementary Table S7). The baiS8 orthologue in sch cluster schA26, also encodes flavin-dependent oxidoreductase. This makes BaiS8 and SchA26 the best candidates for enzymes catalyzing the conversion of amicetose to aculose. Three genes, baiGT1, baiGT2, and baiGT3, are predicted to be involved in glycosylation steps in the assembly of baikalomycins (Figure 5A; Supplementary Table S7). BaiGT3 shows high homology to the C-glycosyltransferases SchS7 (98%), SprGT3 (79%), and UrdGT2 (73%), which catalyze a transfer of the first sugar to the C-9 position of the aglycone. Two other enzymes, BaiGT1 and BaiGT2, are predicted to be O-glycosyltransferases based on their homology to SchS10 (97%) and SchS9 (98%), respectively [30]. 3.6.3. Genes Involved in Regulation, Resistance, and with Unknown Functions Two genes within the bai cluster might be involved in the regulation of baikalomycins production and control of its transport (Figure 5A; Supplementary Table S7). The baiR1 gene product shows similarity to the LndI (66% identity) transcriptional regulator controlling landomycin E biosynthesis [70]. baiR2 codes for TetR family transcriptional regulators that are widely distributed in bacteria, including Streptomyces genera, and typically control the expression of antibiotics transporter genes [71]. Two genes, baiT1 and baiT2, which encode proteins putatively participating in the transport of baikalomycins and strain self-resistance, are found within the bai gene cluster. The baiT1 gene product showed similarity to a major facilitator superfamily of the DHA2 group, typically implicated in multidrug resistance [72]. baiT2 codes for a protein with 65% identity to PgaJ, a putative transmembrane efflux protein from the gaudimycin biosynthesis pathway [73]. Three genes baiX1, X2, and X3 code for conserved hypothetical proteins with orthologues in many actinobacteria genomes but without functions assigned. 3.7. Inactivation of Genes Encoding Glycosyltransferases in bai Cluster In order to prove that the identified gene cluster is responsible for the production of baikalomycins and to investigate the specificity of glycosylation steps during biosynthesis we aimed to delete the genes baiGT1, baiGT2, and baiGT3 within the chromosome of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A. For this, the suicide vector-based strategy was employed. However, the strain was found to be poorly genetically tractable. It took more than 20 attempts with each construct to obtain a few transconjugants. Unfortunately, we failed to introduce the baiGT1 deletion construct into Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A. In the case of two other genes, baiGT2 and baiGT3, mutants were obtained by replacing the corresponding regions of the chromosome of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A with the spectinomycin resistance cassette. Mutant strains were cultivated in the production medium and extracted metabolites were analyzed by LC-MS (Figure 6). As expected, Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2AΔGT3, lacking baiGT3, accumulated rabelomycin (1) and 5-hydroxy- rabelomycin (2), but not glycosylated angucyclines (Figure 6). Furthermore, we found an additional peak (X1) in the extract of the mutant strain with RT of 7.56 and m/z 373.0945 [M-H2O-H]− that corresponds to the mass calculated for aglycone of baikalomycins A and B (exact mass 392.11073, calculated m/z 373.092340 [M-H2O-H]−) (Figure 6; Supplementary Figure S25). This compound is also present in the extract of parental strain but in much smaller quantities. Deletion of baiGT2 abolished production of baikalomycins B and C. However, Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2AΔGT2 demonstrated increased accumulation of baikalomycin A that is barely detectable in the parental strain (Figure 6). These data lead us believe that BaiGT3 catalyzes the attachment of first amicetose at the C-9 of baikalomycins’ aglycone, followed by addition of a second amicetose by BaiGT2. The second sugar might stay unprocessed or is converted to aculose by action of BaiS8, similar to how it occurs in the case of grincamycins and Sch 47554/47555 biosynthesis [27,30]. At the same time, the function of BaiGT1 remained unclear. In the case of Sch 47554/47555 biosynthesis SchS10, the BaiGT1 orthologue is responsible for introduction of a sugar (aculose or amicetose) at C-3 position. However, Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A did not produce baikalomycin trisaccharides under multiple tested conditions. We were also not able to inactivate the baiGT1 gene due to technical difficulties. We have cloned the entire bai gene cluster using transformation-associated recombination technique. As result, a plasmid p8-13bai, carrying 44.01 kb fragment of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A genomic DNA with the bai gene cluster, however, lacking aacC and other downstream genes, (Figure 5A) was expressed in S. albus J1074. As a result, the recombinant strain failed to produce baikalomycins A–C (Figure 7). At the same time, three peaks with m/z of 697.2882 [M-H]− (RT 12.64, 12.89 and 13.11 min) and two peaks with m/z of 695.2734 [M-H]− (RT 14.46 and 14.83 min) and characteristic for angucylines absorption spectrum could be found in the extract of S. albus J1074/p8-13bai (Figure 7, Supplementary Figure S26). These compounds are absent in the extract of Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A. Based on the detected mass and UV spectra these metabolites are proposed to be baikalomycins trisaccharides closely related to Sch-47554/47555. MS2 data support this idea. All five new metabolites have typical angucycline type fragmentation pattern with the characteristic loss of one sugar, most probably at C-3 position (Supplementary Figure S27). Most plausible, that the variety of masses of the detected compounds originate from incomplete conversion of amicetose to aculose, but rather to cineruloses intermediate in one or both saccharides at C-3 and C-9 positions, as it was shown for grincamycins [27]. In the latter case, expression of the grincamycin biosynthesis genes in S. coelicolor yielded vineomycin A1 with two aculose moieties instead of cineruloses, present in grincamycins. It is obvious that the baikalomycins biosynthetic enzymes behave differently in the natural producer and the heterologous host. In fact, Streptomyces sp. IB201691-2A did not produce angucycline trisaccharides under any of tested cultivation conditions but accumulated large amounts of shunt product rabelomycin and its derivatives. Vice versa, S. albus carrying the bai gene cluster accumulated the angucycline trisaccharides. In conclusion, six gene clusters encoding the aquayamycin-type angucyclines biosynthesis have a high degree of sequence identity (Figure 5B) and, at the same time, are responsible for the production of a great variety of related, but still different, natural products. Such variety, obviously, cannot be deduced from the nucleotide sequence analysis and thus leaves high chances to discover new natural products from the highly similar biosynthetic gene clusters.
