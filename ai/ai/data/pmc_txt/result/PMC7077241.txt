2. Results 2.1. Whole Genome Sequence To investigate whether P. citreonigrum has homologous genes to the CTV biosynthesis genes in A. terreus, we conducted a whole genome shotgun analysis using the P. citreonigrum strain IMI92228. In total, 76,116,858 paired-end raw reads were obtained. After quality filtering, 37,808,090 forward reads and 32,889,633 reverse reads remained. 32,731,394 reads had pairs and 5,076,696 reads were single. After the assemble and scaffolding, we obtained 79 scaffolds that were more than 500 bp each and approximately 27 Mbp in total length (Table 1). From the open reading frame (ORF) prediction, 9805 ORFs were predicted, and analysis of single copy genes conserved in Eurotiomycetes showed that 97.3% (3936 genes out of 4046 genes) of genes were found in the obtained scaffolds. The estimated complete genome size was approximately 28 Mbp (27,997,905 bp). All the predicted ORFs were subjected to alignment using protein basic local alignment search tool (BLASTP) with the following five genes that are involved in the CTV biosynthesis of A. terreus and which form a gene cluster in A. terreus genome: ctvA, ctvB, ctvC, ctvD and ctvE (Figure 1a). As a result, we found that the predicted ORFs in the P. citreonigrum strain IMI92228 genome showed high homology to all five CTV biosynthesis genes in A. terreus (Table 2). Among these, the ORFs that showed high homology to ctvA, ctvB, ctvC and ctvD were located on scaffold 16 (2,344,991 bp) (Table 2 and Figure 1). We considered that these specific predicted ORFs were homologous to ctvA to ctvD in A. terreus and were named ci-ctvA to ci-ctvD (Accession number: LC517105 and LC517107 to LC517109). These predicted genes were also found to be arranged in the same order and direction as that of A. terreus, although there is a gene (g1457, LC517106) that cannot be found in A. terreus, between ci-ctvC and ci-ctvD (Figure 1b). The gene g1457 is similar to HC-toxin efflux carrier TOXA of Talaromyces islandicus. Meanwhile, the ORF that showed high homology to ctvE was separated from the others and located on scaffold 19 (2,964,612 bp) (Table 2 and Figure 1). There was only one ORF (g2666, LC517110) that showed high homology to ctvE in the P. citreonigrum genome and the ORF showed higher identity to one of the duplicated genes of the F1-ATPase β-subunit in A. terreus, other than ctvE (ATEG_07609, identity = 90.0%). 2.2. Citreoviridin Production Profile P. citreonigrum was cultured on YES agar and YES agar with 5% NaCl, and CTV production was monitored for 2 weeks. CTV production on the YES agar peaked on day 7 (110.3 ± 11.7 ng/sample) and decreased on day 10 (Figure 2). CTV production was suppressed at a value lower than 1.1 ± 0.4 ng/sample on YES agar with 5% NaCl. 2.3. Gene Expression To validate whether the homologous genes to the CTV biosynthesis genes of A. terreus are involved in CTV biosynthesis in P. citreonigrum, a gene expression analysis of these genes was carried out during 14-day cultures on YES agar and YES with 5% NaCl agar. The expression of ci-ctvA was highest at day 4 and then gradually decreased on YES agar (Figure 3a). The expressions of ci-ctvB, ci-ctvC and ci-ctvD peaked on day 7 (Figure 3b–d). On YES agar with 5% NaCl, the expression of ci-ctvA, ci-ctvB, ci-ctvC and ci-ctvD tended to decrease compared to those of YES agar.
