RESULTS HygA binds in the A site of the peptidyl transferase center and alters its conformation To elucidate the molecular mechanism of action of HygA we first determined its ribosomal binding site using X-ray crystallography. The initial unbiased map clearly showed extra electron density in the A site of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC; Supplementary Figure S2). Its elongated shape with prominent densities at either end allowed unambiguous assignment of the terminal furanose and aminocyclitol groups and the subsequent placement of the central cinnamic acid moiety. Moreover, by comparison with the native 50S structure conformational changes in 23S rRNA residues were also detected in the proximity of HygA (Supplementary Figure S2). The altered nucleotides, including U2506, U2585 and A2602, were remodeled and the resulting structure refined to convergence with a final resolution of 3.0 Å (Table 1; final 2Fo–Fc map seen in Figure 1C and D). As seen in Figure 1, HygA binds in a pocket delimited by A2503, the G2061-A2451 and C2452-U2504 base pairs, and the G2505-U2506 segment. The rRNA residues comprising this binding pocket are universally conserved (>98% conservation) and, therefore, presumably similar across species. Toward the bottom of the pocket (i.e. near the ribosomal tunnel) the two hydroxyl groups of the furanosyl moiety potentially hydrogen bond with nucleotides A2503 and G2505, apparently serving as anchoring points for this moiety. On the contrary, the acetyl group on the furanose ring protrudes into the lumen of the ribosomal tunnel and, therefore, makes no significant interactions with the ribosome (Figures 1C–D and 2C). The central cinnamic acid moiety stacks against the walls of the pocket, namely the G2061-A2451 and C2452-U2504 base pairs, with the C6′ hydroxyl group of HygA within hydrogen-bonding distance of the O2′ and O3′ of G2505 (Figures 1C-D and 2A–C). In addition, the C1′ carboxyl oxygen, in the cinnamic acid moiety, is within hydrogen bonding distance of both the 2′-OH of A2451 and the N6 of A2602 (Figure 2A and C). The aminocyclitol moiety is positioned at the entrance of the binding pocket. In this moiety, the oxygen atoms at positions 5 and 6 potentially hydrogen bond with the N4 of C2573, while its amide nitrogen at position 2 and hydroxyl oxygen at position 3 could form hydrogen bonds with the O2 of U2506 and O4 of U2585, respectively (Figure 2A and C).

Comparing the structures of the PTC's A site in the presence and absence of HygA, reveals that HygA binding induces conformational changes in functionally important PTC nucleotides (Figure 2B). Namely, in the presence of HygA, U2506 and U2585 are shifted and interact, forming a non-canonical Watson–Crick base pair with their N3 and O4 positions alternately hydrogen-bonded (Figure 2A and C, green dotted lines; Supplementary Figure S2C and D). The formation of the U2506 and U2585 base pair in the presence of HygA is in good agreement with chemical probing experiments showing that in the presence of HygA the N3 of both U2585 and U2506 are protected from modification (11). A similar base pair is observed when homoharringtonine, a eukaryotic specific anti-tumorigenic compound targeting the A-site, is bound to the Haloarcula marismortui 50S subunit (44). Furthermore, A2602 is disordered in the native structure (50S apo) but its density becomes more evident in the presence of HygA (Figure 1C and D, Supplementary Figure S2C and D) which likely reflects that it is more stably positioned. Accordingly, our model places the extracyclic amine of A2602 within hydrogen bonding distance of the carboxyl oxygen of the cinnamic acid moiety (Figure 2A–C). Taken together, the X-ray crystallographic analysis indicates that upon binding to the A-site of the PTC, HygA influences the conformation of several nucleotides (i.e. A2602, U2585, U2506) that play critical roles in various stages of translation including positioning the A and P-site tRNAs during peptide bond formation and translocation (25,26,45). A structural alignment of the PTC residues in the 50S–HygA structure with those from structures containing a bound A-site aminoacyl tRNA substrate (25) clearly show that the aminocyclitol and cinnamic acid groups of HygA would overlap and sterically clash with the A76 ribose and aminoacyl moiety, respectively, of the A-site substrate (Figure 3A). This structural alignment also makes it evident that despite the presence in HygA of the aminocyclitol and furanose moiety, which are absent in the A76-aminoacyl tRNA, the portion of HygA that shares a structural similarity with puromycin ((4); highlighted atoms in Figure 3C and F) and thereby also with the A76-aminacyl moiety of the A site tRNA, is similarly located in the two complexes (Figure 3A and B). More specifically, the chemical backbone of HygA, comprised by the three hydroxyl, C2 position and two amino of the aminocyclitol group along with the cinnamic acid moiety of HygA, are similarly located and structurally resemble on the 50S–HygA complex, the 2′ hydroxyl and 3′ amino moiety of the A-site tRNA terminal ribose (A76) and the phenylalanine amino acid residue, of the A-site tRNA on the 70S complex (Figure 3A and B). Moreover, these two related moieties, present in HygA and the A76-aminoacyl tRNA, also establish a network of interactions with the same surrounding ribosomal elements i.e. residues A2451, A2602, U2585 and U2506 (Figure 3C–F). For example, the hydroxyl oxygen at position 3 of the aminocyclitol moiety potentially forms a hydrogen bond with O4 of U2585 (Figure 3E and F) similar to that made by the 2′-OH of the A76 of the A-tRNA (Figure 3C and D). Likewise the carboxyl oxygen in the cinnamic acid moiety is located in H bonding distance to both the 2′ OH of A2451 and the N6-amine of A2602 (Figure 3E and F), similar to the carboxyl oxygen of the A-site bound aminoacyl moiety (Figure 3C and D). Figure 3.The binding site of HygA on the ribosome overlaps with that of the aminoacyl-A76 ribosyl moiety of the A-site tRNA. (A) The 50S–HygA HygA–5 complex was aligned to a 70S ribosome with an accommodated A-site (PDB accession code: 4QCP; (25)) using 23S rRNA residues 2063–2092, 2227–2258, 2435–2457 and 2494–2608 showing that the aminoacyl-A76 ribosyl moiety at the acceptor end of the A-site tRNA (yellow) overlaps with the binding site of HygA (magenta). In (B) only HygA and the aminoacyl-A76 ribosyl moiety from the aligned structures (panel A) are shown to highlight their similarity. When aligned using PTC residues (as shown in A) the 15 atoms spanning from the 3-hydroxyl to C7’ position of HygA (Supplementary Figure S1) and their counterparts in the A-site tRNA (indicated by highlights in the chemical structures shown in panels C and F) have a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.57 Å. When these 15 atoms are directly aligned on themselves they have a RMSD of 0.86 Å. Both the aminoacyl moiety of the A-site tRNA (C and D) and HygA (E and F) appear to be coordinated by a similar hydrogen bond network that includes the 23S rRNA residues A2451 (via 2′-OH of the ribose), U2506 (2′-OH of the ribose in the acylated tRNA and O2 of the base in the 50S–HygA structure) and A2602 (via the N6 amino group) while U2585 in the 50S–HygA complex is kept at a position similar to that seen in PDB accession code: 4QCP (25) by forming a symmetric 4-carbonyl-N3 U-U pair with residue U2506. The carbonyl carbon present in both ligands is labeled as C’. Note that in a native aminoacyl-tRNA an ester oxygen rather than an amide nitrogen links the aminoacyl moiety to the tRNA (this position is indicated by an asterisk in panels B, C and F) that can serve as a proton acceptor only. However, an analogous hydrogen bond between the ester oxygen and U2506 can be formed if the uridine moiety is in the enol form having a hydroxyl group at position 2 acting as proton donor toward the electron pair of the aminoacyl ester oxygen. The binding site of HygA on the ribosome overlaps with that of the aminoacyl-A76 ribosyl moiety of the A-site tRNA. (A) The 50S–HygA HygA–5 complex was aligned to a 70S ribosome with an accommodated A-site (PDB accession code: 4QCP; (25)) using 23S rRNA residues 2063–2092, 2227–2258, 2435–2457 and 2494–2608 showing that the aminoacyl-A76 ribosyl moiety at the acceptor end of the A-site tRNA (yellow) overlaps with the binding site of HygA (magenta).

Note that in a native aminoacyl-tRNA an ester oxygen rather than an amide nitrogen links the aminoacyl moiety to the tRNA (this position is indicated by an asterisk in panels B, C and F) that can serve as a proton acceptor only. However, an analogous hydrogen bond between the ester oxygen and U2506 can be formed if the uridine moiety is in the enol form having a hydroxyl group at position 2 acting as proton donor toward the electron pair of the aminoacyl ester oxygen. Despite the chemical similarity of the interactions observed, they differ in their precise spatial arrangement because HygA alters the conformation of 23S nucleotides (U2585, U2506) and itself does not enter as deeply into the A-site, particularly the aminocyclitol moiety, as a fully accommodated A-site substrate (25). Namely it appears that the U2585–U2506 base pair and the conformation of the aminocyclitol moiety prevents HygA from being accommodated exactly like an aminoacyl tRNA (Figure 3A and B). Given the chemical similarity between HygA and the aminoacyl-tRNA, the PTC state observed in the presence of HygA could be characteristic of a canonical state acquired as the aminoacyl-tRNA enters or leaves the A-site that is trapped and exploited by HygA to inhibit protein synthesis or it could be an off-pathway state induced only by the drug. HygA binding induces structural changes not only in proximal nucleotides but also in distal helices that connect the PTC to the GTPase associated region Hydroxyl radical rRNA cleavage of E. coli 70S ribosomes bound to HygA supports the description of the HygA binding site presented above. While alteration in the reactivity of A2453, A2572, G2574, G2576 and G2581 (Figure 4A and B) can be explained by their proximity to the HygA binding site (Figure 4C and D), unexpectedly, additional nucleotides in more distant regions were also affected, indicating that HygA binding caused long-range conformational changes in the 23S rRNA. The affected nucleotides cluster in specific regions of H89, H90 and H92/92a (Figure 4D). These helices stem from the central loop region of domain V of the 23S rRNA, where the PTC and thus HygA and the aminoacyl moiety of the A-site tRNA are located, and reach the GTPase associated region (GAR; H43/H44, H95 and the ribosomal proteins L11, L10 and L7/L12) which influences the GTPase activity of translational factors such as the elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G (Figure 4 D).

Further details are given in ‘Materials and Methods’ section. Helices, H89/H90-H92, also form the aa-tRNA accommodation corridor, which the aminoacyl tRNA transits as it is accommodated into the PTC (46). This corridor presents several steric barriers, which recent simulations suggest the tRNA navigates by following multiple PTC entry pathways and the selection of these pathways could be influenced by the conformation of the PTC (46). HygA allows aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the ribosome but perturbs its subsequent adjustment that allows it to act as a PT substrate The crystallographic data obtained in this study indicate that HygA binds within the PTC and thereby occludes the aminoacyl-A76 ribose moiety from the catalytic site (Figure 3). Accordingly, experiments were carried out to determine to which extent this competition affects the binding of the entire aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome. As seen from the results presented in Figure 5A HygA does not inhibit EF-Tu-dependent binding of Phe-tRNA to poly(U) programmed 70S ribosomes even in the presence of high HygA concentrations when measured by nitrocellulose filtration which assesses the association of the tRNA with ribosome. In comparison, similar concentrations of the known 30S A-site inhibitor, tetracycline, caused almost complete inhibition of the binding (Figure 5A). This finding is in agreement with the results of a previous study (10). However, when the A-site binding was followed by stopped-flow kinetics using fluorescently labeled Phe-tRNAphe (Prf16/17) (Figure 5B), which reflects not only tRNA binding but also its chemical environment, a clear effect of HygA was detected. In fact, unlike in the control samples in which the fluorescence intensity of the labeled tRNA increases and then decreases reflecting an initial binding of the ligand followed by its adjustment on the ribosome, the latter adjustment step was not observed in the samples containing HygA, as the fluorescence intensity remained high (Figure 5B). Together these findings indicated that whereas HygA does not completely prevent tRNA binding to the A site it prevents the tRNA from reaching a fully accommodated state. In agreement HygA inhibits the PT reaction when assayed using both natural amino acid substrates (fMet and Phe) as well as the aminoacyl mimic, puromycin (Figure 5C and D) (10). The HygA dose-response curves show that inhibition of mRNA translation and dipeptide formation are superimposable (Figure 5C) indicating that inactivation of the PT activity can fully account for the block of mRNA translation caused by this antibiotic. Namely HygA appears to be a powerful inhibitor of PT activity, binding tightly to the ribosome with respect to canonical A-site substrates and effectively blocking both the specific PT assay and the more general mRNA translation assay possibly from the first peptide bond that yields the ‘initiation dipeptide’. This could explain why the dose response curves for the inhibition of mRNA translation and dipeptide formation are essentially superimposable. This premise is supported by the observation of Guerrero and colleagues that HygA once bound to the ribosome cannot easily be washed away by sucrose gradients or gel filtration chromatography (10). The binding of HygA into the PTC is further indicated by the observation that HygA competes with the known A-site binding antibiotic chloramphenicol (Figure 6A; (10)) but it responds differently to a 23S rRNA mutation (G2061A) (47) that confers resistance to chloramphenicol. Namely an in vitro translation assay that utilizes ribosomes harboring the G2061A mutation (47) is sensitive to CAM but not HygA (Figure 6B). These results support the crystallographic studies that indicate HygA primarily interferes with the accommodation of the aminoacyl-tRNA's CCA end (acceptor domain) into the PTC thus blocking the PT reaction.
