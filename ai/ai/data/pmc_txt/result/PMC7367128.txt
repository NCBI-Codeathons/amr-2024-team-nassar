RESULTS E. coli YcaQ is an alkylpurine DNA glycosylase We first set out to determine whether other members of the HTH_42 family were bona fide AlkZ orthologs with DNA glycosylase activity. A search of the Pfam database (29) revealed 4,650 AlkZ orthologs, with 37% from pathogenic organisms and 21% annotated in antibiotic producing bacteria, consistent with a previous analysis (14). The sequences fell into one of two clades that differ in the catalytic motif. We previously showed that the glycosylase activity of S. sahachiroi AlkZ is dependent on two glutamine residues within a QΦQ motif, in which Φ is a hydrophobic residue. However, about 55% of the putative orthologs have an aspartate in the third position (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S1). We focused on one of these QΦD sequences—the uncharacterized ycaQ gene found in E. coli, which shares 54% sequence similarity and 31% identity to Streptomyces AlkZ. Figure 1.YcaQ is a Monofunctional DNA Glycosylase Specific for Cationic N-Alkylpurines.

(F) Structure and excision of mFaPy-dG DNA, treated with E. coli Fpg, YcaQ, or buffer for the specified time, followed by alkaline hydrolysis. We first tested whether YcaQ has DNA glycosylase activity for a simple alkyl-DNA monoadduct using the same N7-deoxymethylguanosine (d7mG) substrate tested previously against AlkZ (Figure 1B) (20). Purified YcaQ was incubated with d7mG-DNA containing a 5′-FAM label, followed by treatment with either hydroxide or the bacterial AP endonuclease, EndoIV, to nick any resulting AP sites. Compared to a no-enzyme control, YcaQ exhibited robust monofunctional base excision activity, as over 90% of the YcaQ treated substrate showed alkaline or AP endonuclease dependent cleavage (Figure 1C). We confirmed the importance of the putative QΦD catalytic motif by showing that alanine substitution of either Gln45 or Asp47 abrogated 7mG excision (Figure 1D). Mutation of Asp47 to asparagine did not affect base excision activity (Figure 1D), consistent with a functional carboxamide in this position in the QΦQ family. Compared to AlkZ, YcaQ displayed much faster 7mG excision kinetics, taking the reaction to completion in under one minute (Figure 1E) (20). We also tested wither YcaQ requires a cationic d7mG lesion for activity by converting the d7mG in our substrate to a ring-opened, neutral methylformamidopyrimidine (mFaPy) derivative (Figure 1F). Compared to a FaPy DNA glycosylase (Fpg) control, YcaQ had no excision activity for the mFaPy adduct, even after one hour (Figure 1F). Together these results show that YcaQ is a monofunctional DNA glycosylase from E. coli that can excise cationic d7mG monoadducts with rapid kinetics. AlkZ and YcaQ unhook either side of an AZB-ICL To examine ICL unhooking by the AlkZ/YcaQ family of glycosylases, we first compared their activities for AZB-ICLs. The azinomycins contain electrophilic epoxide and aziridine moieties that react with d(GCC)/d(GGC) sequences in a specific orientation to form an asymmetric ICL (Figure 2A) (30–32). AZB preferentially orients itself such that the epoxide moiety reacts with the GCC sequence and the aziridine reacts with GGC (Figure 2B). The previous study showing AZB-ICL cleavage by AlkZ did not address if the enzyme has a preference for unhooking one side versus the other (14). To better understand the mechanism of ICL unhooking, we devised a DNA substrate that would allow us to track individual strands. Pure AZB-ICL substrates for glycosylase assays were generated by incubating S. sahachiroi cell extracts with a 26-mer oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing a single AZB reactive sequence, followed by denaturing PAGE purification to isolate the resulting crosslinked DNA. GCC and GGC strands were distinguished with FAM and Cy5 fluorescent labels at their 5′-ends, respectively, so that unhooking produces either FAM-AP + Cy5-monoadduct (MA) strands or FAM-MA + Cy5-AP strands (Figure 2C). In addition, the reactive sequence is offset toward one end of the duplex so that alkaline cleavage of the resulting AP sites will generate specific FAM- or Cy5-labeled β- and β+δ-elimination products that will migrate differently on a denaturing gel (Figure 2C). Figure 2.AlkZ and YcaQ can unhook either side of an azinomycin B-ICL. (A) Reaction of azinomycin B with guanines on opposing strands to form an ICL.

(G) Quantification of the fraction of monoadduct (MA) and β,δ-elimination (nicked product) from the mock (left), AlkZ (middle), and YcaQ (right) reactions from the gel in panel F. Heat treatment of the purified AZB-ICL substrate at 95°C for 5 min resulted in cleavage of both sides of the crosslink, as evidenced by both FAM- and Cy5-labeled AP and MA strands that could be resolved on the gel (Figure 2D, lane 3). Treatment of the heat denatured ICLs with hydroxide converted the faster migrating AP strands into nicked β/δ-elimination products and left the MA strands intact (Figure 2D, lane 4). Alkali treatment also converted the ICL into a slower-migrating species, consistent with conversion of the double-cationic species to a neutral FaPy-ICL. Thus, AZB-ICLs display the same heat-labile depurination as other N7-guanine lesions (33). At 25°C, the AZB-ICL substrate is stable, showing no degradation after one hour (Figure 2D, lanes 5–6). Incubation with AlkZ under the same condition resulted in complete (97%) ICL unhooking into elimination products from both strands, indicating that AlkZ unhooks the AZB-ICL from either side. The persistence of a modest amount of FAM-labeled alkali-resistant MA strand suggested an enzymatic preference for unhooking the GGC side of the crosslink (Figure 2D, lane 7). Because the bases tethered by an ICL are constrained across the duplex, unhooking likely does not involve base-flipping as observed in other glycosylases. However, we found that the non-base flipping glycosylase AlkD (34,35) had no activity for the AZB-ICL substrate, indicating that ICL unhooking is not simply a product of a non-base-flipping mechanism and that recognition of AZB requires a specific type of enzyme. YcaQ also unhooked the AZB-ICL substrate to generate AP sites on both strands (Figures 2E-G), albeit in a slightly different manner than AlkZ. Interestingly, whereas the FAM-MA strand persisted in the AlkZ reaction, YcaQ generated more Cy5-MA strand (compare WT lanes in Figure 2E), suggesting a difference in strand preference of the two enzymes. Second, alanine substitution of either residue in the catalytic QΦQ and QΦD motifs had different effects on unhooking. Mutation of QΦQ in AlkZ only partially reduced unhooking, while substitutions within YcaQ QΦD had a greater effect (Figure 2E), suggesting that the two enzymes rely on these motifs for catalysis to a different extent. Incidentally, the YcaQ D47N mutation had no effect on ICL unhooking activity, similar to its behavior against the d7mG monoadduct. To further probe the apparent strand preference between AlkZ and YcaQ, we monitored the kinetics of AP and MA strand product formation over two hours under single-turnover conditions (Figure 2F,G). AlkZ showed robust AZB-ICL unhooking activity (kcat = 2 × 10−2 s−1)—three orders of magnitude faster than that observed previously for a d7mG monoadduct (kcat = 8.5 × 10−5 s−1) (20). YcaQ displayed 4-fold slower AZB-ICL unhooking kinetics under the same conditions (kcat = 4 × 10−3 s−1) (Figure 2F). Quantification of products from both FAM and Cy5 strands shows that AlkZ has a distinct preference for unhooking the GGC (Cy5) strand, as shown by the greater burst in cleaved Cy5-AP and uncleaved FAM-MA strands (Figure 2F,G). In contrast, YcaQ had a modest preference for unhooking the GCC (FAM) strand (Figure 2F,G), but the differences in FAM and Cy5 strand kinetics in the YcaQ reaction were not as dramatic as in AlkZ. These data show that the orthologous YcaQ and AlkZ enzymes unhook AZB-ICLs from either side, and with unique strand specificities. YcaQ unhooks ICLs derived from nitrogen mustards AlkZ presumably evolved to provide self-resistance to AZB produced in soil-dwelling S. sahachiroi, whereas YcaQ in E. coli residing in the human gut would not encounter such a lesion. We therefore examined the ability of these enzymes to recognize an ICL derived from the nitrogen mustard (NM) mechlorethamine, a structurally simpler bifunctional alkylating agent than AZB (2). Like AZB, mechlorethamine reacts with N7 of both guanines within d(GNC) sequences to form ICLs that lead to the toxicity of these compounds (36) (Figure 3A). Using a site-specific NM-ICL oligonucleotide substrate (27) containing individually labeled strands (Figure 3A), we found that YcaQ unhooked either side (Figure 3B). We verified that this activity is specific to YcaQ, as β/δ-elimination products were not observed from QΦD (Q45A, D47A) catalytic mutants (Figure 3B), or from other alkylpurine DNA glycosylases, including human AAG, E. coli AlkA, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mag1 (Figure 3C; Supplementary Figure S3B). Furthermore, YcaQ showed no unhooking activity toward FaPy-ICLs (Supplementary Figure S3D,E), consistent with our results with mFaPy monoadducts indicating that the cationic, ring-closed guanine is required for the reaction. Most strikingly, comparison of the kinetics of NM-ICL unhooking showed that YcaQ was remarkably efficient (the reaction was complete in less than 5 minutes), whereas AlkZ showed no activity (Figure 3D). Unlike the asymmetric unhooking observed with the AZB-ICL, we did not detect a strand preference from the symmetric NM-ICL (Figure 3E). Comparison of the activities of both enzymes for AZB- and NM-ICLs shows that AlkZ is specific for AZB, whereas YcaQ can unhook chemically diverse ICLs, with robust activity toward the ICL with less chemical functionality.

The mechanism of lesion recognition by a repair enzyme is a key question in ICL repair. Crosslinks may be located either by explicit interaction with the crosslinking molecule or by a structural perturbation of the DNA imposed by the crosslink. AZB, which has a 10-atom tether between guanines, is not expected to distort the DNA (31). In contrast, the 5-atom tether in the NM-ICL has been shown to kink the double helix (37,38). To determine whether the differences in ICL specificity of AlkZ and YcaQ are the result of DNA distortion, we synthesized a NM derivative that would produce an 8-atom ICL (NM8-ICL) when incorporated into our oligodeoxynucleotide substrate (Figure 4A), similar to that used previously (1). The increased tether length of the NM8-ICL should be able to crosslink the opposing guanines in B-form DNA without distorting the helix. Consistent with N7-alkylation at both sites, the purified NM8-ICL was heat-labile and fully depurinated from both strands after 5 min at 95°C (Figure 4B, lanes 1–3), but was stable at 25°C for at least 2 hr (Figure 4B, lanes 4–10). Compared to a no-enzyme control, AlkZ exhibited a low level of unhooking activity for the NM8-ICL substrate (Figure 4B,C, Supplementary Figure S4), suggesting that the steric strain present in the NM5-ICL at least partially inhibits AlkZ activity. However, AlkZ’s modest activity for the NM8-ICL was still much less than that of the AZB-ICL, and thus we conclude that explicit contact with the AZB moiety is an important aspect of ICL recognition by AlkZ. YcaQ showed strong activity toward the NM8-ICL as it did with the NM5-ICL (Figure 4B), indicating that a kinked duplex is not required for ICL unhooking by the E. coli enzyme.

(C) Quantification of the fraction of ICL from three separate experiments (mean ± SEM). YcaQ and AlkZ create opposing AP sites in vitro Because AlkZ and YcaQ are able to act on either side of the crosslink, we asked whether they could act on both sides of the same crosslink. Such activity would generate two closely-spaced AP sites on opposite strands that in cells would potentially lead to a double-strand break (DSB). Indeed, the initial characterization of AlkZ activity toward AZB-DNA provided evidence that the enzyme produces opposing AP sites that can be subsequently cleaved by EndoIV (14). To further test this, we analyzed the products of EndoIV-treated AlkZ/AZB-ICL and YcaQ/NM-ICL reactions by native PAGE to quantify single- and double-nicked products. Both reactions showed at least 50% double-nicked product and a modest (10–20%) amount of monoadduct intermediate after one hour (Figure 5A, B, Supplementary Figure S5A), indicating that AlkZ and YcaQ cleave both sides of the crosslinks to generate AP sites on opposing strands. HPLC-MS analysis of the excision products of the YcaQ NM-ICL reaction confirmed the presence of an unmodified bis-guanine NM-ICL, with an observed m/z of 386.1799 Da, which is a 0.78 ppm difference from the calculated m/z of 386.1796 Da for Gua-NM5-Gua. The difference in rates of unhooking the two sides of the crosslink shown in Figure 2 argues that the strands are cleaved sequentially, which would proceed via an intermediate containing an AP site on one strand across from a monoadduct on the other. In support of this, we found that YcaQ is able to excise 7mG in a duplex containing an AP site on the opposite strand in the position it would reside in the unhooked NM- or AZB-ICL intermediate (Figure 5C). Figure 5.YcaQ and AlkZ create opposing AP sites. (A) Native PAGE analysis of DNA products formed from YcaQ incubation with NM5-ICL and AlkZ incubation with AZB-ICL DNA substrates.

Deletion or overexpression of YcaQ sensitizes E. coli to crosslinking agents Repair of mechlorethamine derived NM-ICLs in E. coli is known to be initiated by the UvrABC nucleotide excision system (39). Given the robust unhooking of NM-ICLs by YcaQ in vitro, we compared YcaQ’s role in protecting E. coli against mechlorethamine to that of UvrA using genetic knockouts. Relative to the wild-type strain, ΔycaQ cells showed a modest growth defect in the presence of low levels of mechlorethamine (Supplementary Figure S6A). As expected from the importance of UvrA in ICL repair, ΔuvrA cells showed a more severe growth deficiency. This sensitivity was exacerbated in a ΔycaQΔuvrA double knockout (Supplementary Figure S6A), suggesting that YcaQ plays a minor role in ICL repair in E. coli. To examine this more quantitatively, we determined EC50 values for the deletion strains exposed to increasing doses of mechlorethamine using a colony dilution assay (Figure 6A). Consistent with the growth sensitivity, ΔycaQ cells showed a modest but significant reduction in EC50 compared to wild-type, and sensitivity of the ΔycaQΔuvrA mutant was greater than for ΔuvrA alone (Figure 6B). Exogenous expression of ycaQ in the deletion strain rescued the mechlorethamine sensitivity compared to an empty vector control (Figure 6C, D). Thus, YcaQ provides a bona fide mechanism for cellular protection against ICL toxicity, albeit to a lesser extent than the UvrABC system.

(H) qRT-PCR results of DNA repair genes after treatment of E. coli with 5 mM MMS or 200 μM mechlorethamine (HN2) for 2 hr. Average ± SEM for three biological replicates. We also found that overexpression of ycaQ exhibited a dramatic increase in mechlorethamine sensitivity, with an EC50 value approaching that of ΔuvrA cells (Figure 6E, F). This increased sensitivity was dependent on the catalytic activity of YcaQ, as overexpression of the inactive D47A mutant had no effect. Sensitivity to DNA damaging agents from DNA glycosylase overexpression is known to result from overwhelming the cells with AP sites and other toxic BER intermediates (40–43). Consistent with this interpretation, overexpression of both ycaQ and the AP endonuclease endoIV (nfo), which would help clear AP sites via BER, rescued the sensitivity (Figure 6E, F; Supplementary Figure S6B). These results further implicate BER as a mechanism of ICL repair in bacteria. Because YcaQ also displays activity toward alkyl monoadducts, we tested the effect of ycaQ deletion and overexpression on cells challenged with the methylating agent methylmethanesulfonate (MMS). E. coli contains only two other alkyl DNA glycosylases, the constitutively active Tag and inducible AlkA (44,45). We found that the ΔycaQ strain was no more sensitive to MMS than wild-type cells, in stark contrast to the effect of knocking out both Tag and AlkA (Figure 6G; Supplementary Figure S6C, D) (46,47). Overexpression of ycaQ increased cellular sensitivity towards MMS, although not to the same extent as observed for mechlorethamine treatment (Figure 6G; Supplementary Figure S6E). This sensitivity was partially rescued by overexpression of both ycaQ and endoIV, again consistent with ycaQ overexpression leading to generation of toxic BER intermediates. YcaQ is constitutively expressed in cells Prokaryotes have several inducible DNA damage responses to crosslinking and alkylating agents (48,49). To test if ycaQ expression is induced by ICL agents, quantitative RT-PCR was performed on E. coli cells exposed to mechlorethamine (Supplementary Figure S6F). As part of the SOS response to crosslinking agents, the NER uvr genes are under the control of the lexA repressor. Both lexA and uvrA showed a robust increase in gene expression upon mechlorethamine treatment, whereas ycaQ expression remained unchanged after treatment (Figure 6H). We also tested whether ycaQ is induced by the methylating agent MMS. The adaptive response genes, ada and alkA, were used as positive controls and the constitutively expressed glycosylase tag served as a negative control. Whereas both ada and alkA showed elevated mRNA levels, we found that ycaQ expression is not induced by MMS (Figure 6H). Together, these results indicate that ycaQ gene expression is not induced by either of the ICL or alkylating agents tested.
