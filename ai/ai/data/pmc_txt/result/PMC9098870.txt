Results and discussion Transcriptomics analysis reveals polyynes as antifungal agents and their encoding BGC in Massilia sp. YMA4 An antagonism assay of Massilia sp. YMA4 against C. albicans revealed a distinct phenotype showing that the antifungal metabolites were produced in potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium but not in yeast malt agar (YMA) medium (Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, the antifungal metabolites were unstable in the extract and laborious to purify for bioassays using the classic bioactivity-guided isolation approach, which includes purification with click chemistry, exclusion of oxygen and light, or careful optimization7,12,16. Therefore, to reveal the antifungal metabolites and their BGCs, we used a combined transcriptomics and metabolomics approach to explore the compounds produced in the two different media (PDA and YMA). First, the BGCs in the genome of Massilia sp. YMA4 were characterized via DeepBGC17 with default settings and integrated with the criteria: DeepBGC score > 0.7 to characterize 13 BGCs in Massilia sp. YMA4 (Supplementary Data 1). Then, the differentially expressed genes (192 upregulated and 226 downregulated with P-value < 0.05 and |fold change | > 2) from transcriptomics analysis of PDA vs. YMA cultured cells were mapped into the 13 characterized BGCs. Among them, only one BGC was upregulated in PDA compared to YMA (Supplementary Data 1), and we named this gene cluster massilin (mas) BGC with 12 transcribed genes (masA to masL) (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1Polyynes and polyyne biosynthesis gene cluster of Massilia sp.

YMA4 wild type (black) and the biosynthesis null mutant strains (YMA4::masH) with a 10 ppm mass window. To characterize the metabolites produced from mas BGC, we constructed mutant strains through insertion mutation at the masH (encoding fatty acid desaturase) gene locus in Massilia sp. YMA4 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The result of the antagonism assay illustrated that YMA4::masH lost antifungal activity against C. albicans (Supplementary Fig. 3), which demonstrated that mas BGC was crucial for the antifungal activity of Massilia sp. YMA4. Furthermore, a study of polyyne BGC (pgn BGC) in P. protegens had determined that the mutation of homolog (pgnH) of masH and masI in pgn BGC can effectively disrupt the production of protegencin (also known as protegenin A)12. We then conducted mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics to analyze the differential features in wild type and biosynthesis-deficient mutant strain YMA4::masH. Via target isolation of differential features, we purified four polyynes (collimonin C/D 1, 2, and massilin A/B 3, 4) from ethyl acetate extract of Massilia sp. YMA4 (Fig. 1b, c). Their structures were elucidated using high-resolution mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5) and nuclear magnetic resonance (Supplementary Tables 1–4 and Supplementary Figs. 6–21; the detailed isolation procedure and structure elucidation are described in Supplementary Methods). Among the four polyynes identified from Massilia sp. YMA4, collimonin C 1 and collimonin D 2 were initially isolated from C. fungivorans Ter3317. A new compound with an ene-triyne moiety was named massilin A 3 and identified as a racemate at C(6)OH of an unsaturated hexadecanoic acid. Another new ene-diyne-ene compound, massilin B 4, was presumed to be the precursor of collimonin C 1 or collimonin D 2. Notably, massilin B 4 was more chemically stable than other polyynes with a terminal alkyne. In antifungal activity assay (Supplementary Fig. 22), polyynes with a terminal alkyne showed potent inhibition of C. albicans with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC): 69.73 μM (collimonin C 1), 35.24 μM (collimonin D 2), and 2.40 μM (massilin A 3). However, massilin B 4 with a terminal alkene moiety had no antifungal activity with MIC > 500 μM. These results suggest that the terminal alkyne is essential for polyyne antifungal activity and stability. Phylogenetic analysis of polyyne BGCs and mas heterologous co-expression revealed the core components for polyyne biosynthesis The in-silico mining and comparative studies of polyynes/ terminal alkyne containing BGCs indicated that jamABC homologs (fatty acyl-AMP ligase (FAAL), fatty acid desaturase (FAD), and acyl carrier protein (ACP)) in jamaicamides (jam) BGC would be the minimal module for polyynes biosynthesis18,19. In addition, the gene cluster K in C. fungivorans Ter331 (collimonin BGC, which is abbreviated to col BGC) recruited not only FAAL, FAD, and ACP but also hydrolase/thioesterase (H/TE) and rubredoxin (Rd)6,7. Therefore, we further explored the architecture of 56 bacterial polyynes BGCs with mas BGC as a reference to confirm the conserved composition of polyyne biosynthetic associated enzymes. It contains the FAAL–2x FAD–ACP–FAD–H/TE–Rd (Supplementary Fig. 23). The essential proteins, including FAAL, FAD, and H/TE in the conserved region of polyyne BGCs, have been confirmed in the biosynthesis of caryoynencin in B. caryophylli16, cepacins in Burkholderia ambifaria4, and protegenins in P. protegens12,13. To further verify the function of other core biosynthetic genes, we use plasmid-derived insertion mutagenesis to gain serial mutants of mas BGC from masD (encoded FAAL) to masL (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). YMA4::masD, YMA4::masE, YMA4::masF, YMA4::masH, and YMA4::masI exhibited completely disrupted polyyne biosynthesis. YMA4::masJ exhibited significantly decreased production of polyynes. However, YMA4::masK and YMA4::masL did not affect the biosynthesis process. To complement the mutagenesis results, we further established an E. coli heterologous co-expression system of mas genes to determine whether the genes participate in polyyne biosynthesis. The engineered E. coli mas– (heterologous co-expression with masD to masJ) produced a relatively nonpolar polyyne (Fig. 2a). This new ene-triyne polyyne was named massilin C 5 (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Figs. 24–28). The results demonstrated that masD to masJ are the core genes in the biosynthesis of the ene-triyne moiety. On the other hand, the expression of masB in Massilia sp. YMA4 was upregulated when cultured in PDA medium (Supplementary Data 1), like the core genes masD to masJ. Therefore, we proposed masB, a dioxygenase gene, as a candidate for the hydroxylation of polyynes since cytochrome P450s or dioxygenases can execute similar reactions20,21. The masB incorporated strain, mas + , produced collimonin C/D 1, 2 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 24), which suggested massilin C 5 is a biosynthetic intermediate and further hydroxylated by MasB to generate polyynes 1–4. Furthermore, the absence of masJ significantly decreased the accumulation of polyynes in mas expressed E. coli (mas–' and mas + ', Fig. 2), indicating the crucial role of rubredoxin in polyyne biosynthesis. As an electron transporter, rubredoxin can shuttle reducing molecules from NAD(P)H to membrane-bound alkane hydroxylases22, which is likely crucial to activation/regeneration of acetylenase/desaturase for the poly-dehydrogenation process in polyyne biosynthesis.Fig. 2Heterologous co-expression of mas genes in E. coli.a The EIC (m/z 241.1234) of engineered E. coli strain, which carried masD, masE, masF, masG, Bv4687 (homolog of masH from Burkholderia vietnamiensis LMG 10929) and masI when co-expressed with (mas–, top) or without (mas–', bottom) masJ. b The EIC (m/z 273.1132) of E. coli strain mas– and mas–' harboring additional dioxygenase (masB) were renamed as mas + and mas + '.

MasL serves as a polyyne direct target with a protective function “Antibiotic resistome” refers to the notion that not only antibiotic resistance genes present in resistant pathogens but also those in the antibiotic producers often harbor resistance genes for self-protection23,24. Sometimes the resistance genes are located within the BGC of antibiotics25. To reveal the target protein of the bacterial polyynes of interest, we adopted the concept of the antibiotic resistome. We conducted phylogenetic analysis of bacterial polyyne BGCs and classified the BGCs into two chemotaxonomic groups: a palmitate-derived (C16) and a stearate-derived (C18) group (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 29). In the palmitate-derived group BGCs, cepacin (ccn) BGC branched out before the most recent common ancestor of mas/col BGCs.Fig. 3Comparative analysis of polyyne biosynthetic gene clusters and the structures of the bacterial polyynes.a Phylogenetical analysis of polyyne biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in bacteria (Supplementary Figs. 23 and 29).

Interestingly, the gene encoding the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, implicated in multidrug resistance and transports of small molecules and xenobiotics26, is preserved in col BGC but lost in mas BGC (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 6, and Supplementary Data 2). This implies that Massilia sp. YMA4 has an alternative protection mechanism for self-protection from polyynes. Notably, a conspicuous gene masL, an acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase gene, remains in mas BGC and ancestor ccn BGC but is absent in col BGC. We, therefore, proposed that masL is a potential self-resistance gene of polyynes. To evaluate the protective effect of masL, we first heterologously expressed masL in polyyne-sensitive C. albicans. The expression of masL rescued fungal cell viability from polyyne inhibition under minimum inhibitory concentration (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 7). Furthermore, an in vitro acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (MasL) inhibition assay showed that polyynes (collimonin C/D 1, 2, and massilin A 3) inhibited the MasL enzyme activity (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 30). Since the drug target identification could be achieved by gene overexpression for gain-of-function of resistance27, we suggest masL serves as a self-resistance gene in the mas BGC, and the acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase it encodes is the target of collimonin C/D 1, 2 and massilin A 3. This targeting manner might explain why the growth of mas expressed E. coli is unaffected when producing polyynes without masL because E. coli has an acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase-independent route, the methylerythritol phosphate (also called deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate) pathway, to produce isoprenoid28,29. Moreover, ccn BGC divided into mas BGC and col BGC independently, and each contains a different self-protection mechanism, which implies a deletion event after horizontal gene transfer30.Fig. 4C. albicans was rescued by heterologous overexpression of masL (OE masL) and ERG10 (OE ERG10) from the minimum inhibitory concentration of collimonin C/D 1, 2, massilin A 3, and massilin C 5.The cell viabilities were normalized to the mock treatment.

Polyynes are covalent inhibitors of acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase To investigate how bacterial polyynes target acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, we solved the crystal structures of MasL in its apo and two holo (bound collimonin C 1 and collimonin D 2) forms at 1.78 Å, 1.66 Å, and 1.40 Å resolution, respectively (Table 2). The asymmetric unit (space group P1 for apo MasL and MasL-collimonin D complex; P21 for MasL-collimonin C complex) of both structures contains a tetramer of the protein (Fig. 5, Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 31), as observed in solution. The monomer of MasL shares the general fold architecture reported in the type II biosynthetic thiolase family31. MasL consists of three domains: an N-terminal α/β domain (N-domain, residues 1–121 and 251–271), a loop domain (L-domain, residues 122–250), and a C-terminal α/β domain (C-domain, residues 272–394) (Supplementary Fig. 32). The N- and C-domains form a typical five-layered fold (α-β-α-β-α) as observed in the structures of the other type II biosynthetic thiolases including Zoogloea ramigera PhaA31, Clostridium acetobutylicum CEA_G288032, and Aspergillus fumigatus ERG10A33. The L-domain displays an α/β fold with a tetramerization loop associated with the C-domain.Table 2X-ray data collection and refinement statistics.MasLMasL-collimonin C complexMasL-collimonin D complexPDB code7EI37EI47FEAData collectionSpace groupP1P21P1Cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)71.786, 76.995, 98.08259.139, 115.077, 125.78966.943, 77.741, 98.117 α, β, γ (°)79.77, 79.00, 62.9890.00, 91.08, 90.0070.76, 81.78, 64.99Resolution (Å)*30.0–1.78 (1.84-1.78)30.0–1.66 (1.72-1.66)30.0–1.40 (1.45-1.40)Rmerge0.045 (0.233)0.082 (0.560)0.056 (0.553)I / σI23.8 (5.0)17.7 (2.0)16.3 (2.0)Completeness (%)*92.3 (85.2)99.4 (94.4)94.8 (86.0)Redundancy*3.8 (3.9)5.6 (4.8)2.9 (2.5)RefinementResolution (Å)29.9–1.7829.2–1.6627.16-1.40No. reflections160,857180,941292,742Rwork/Rfree0.128/0.1800.114/0.1620.146/0.163No. atoms Protein11,52211,54411,808 Ligand/ion–8080 Water1,6631,7201,671B-factors Protein22.318.319.8 Ligand/ion–44.053.3 Water34.934.132.6R.m.s. deviations Bond lengths (Å)0.0080.0090.015 Bond angles (°)1.4551.4491.530*Highest-resolution shell is shown in parentheses.Fig. 5X-ray structures and polar interaction within the binding site of MasL-collimonin C and MasL-collimonin D complex.Overall views of the crystal structures of MasL-collimonin C complex (a) and MasL-collimonin D (b).

Many high-resolution atomic structural models of the substrate-binding complex revealed the Claisen condensation reaction and binding model within the reaction pocket of acetyl-CoA acetyltransferases. In apo and holo forms of MasL, the substrate-binding pocket was located on the enzyme’s surface facing the opposite dimer of the tetrameric assembly. The pocket was a tunnel shape of ~10 Å depth with ~6–8 Å diameter for the linear pantothenic moiety of coenzyme A (CoA) extending through the reactive center. The reactive center in MasL contained reactive cysteine residues Cys90 and nucleophilic activation residues His350 and Cys380. In the MasL-collimonin C complex, the conjugated polyyne tail extended into the MasL substrate binding site and formed a covalent bond between the terminal carbon (C16) of the alkyne moiety and the reactive cysteine sulfhydryl moiety of Cys90 via nucleophilic addition (Supplementary Figs. 33 and 34). Thus, the terminal alkyne was essential for polyyne activity through covalent modification on the reactive cysteine sulfhydryl group of acetyl-CoA acetyltransferases. Although we did not obtain a good X-ray diffraction result surrounding the reactive Cys90 in the MasL-collimonin D complex, the nucleophilic addition mechanism of polyynes to the acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis (Supplementary Fig. 35 and Supplementary Data 3). The observation of collimonin C/D (+C16H18O4)–derived adducts of enzyme reactive cysteine residue provided convincing evidence of protein irreversible S-alkylation via nucleophilic addition to the conjugated terminal alkyne. Furthermore, the observation of massilin A (+C16H18O3)–derived adducts suggest that massilin A 3 would also covalently inhibit acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase activity. In the further comparative analysis of the polar interactions in the activation pocket of MasL in MasL-collimonin C and MasL-collimonin D complex, the C(7)OH moiety of collimonin C/D 1, 2, His158 of MasL, and a water molecule formed a strong polar interaction network, including a direct hydrogen bond (3.00–3.16 Å) and a water-mediated hydrogen bond between C(7)OH and His158 (Fig. 5). Furthermore, although there was no significant induced-fit within the pocket, the collimonin C/D 1, 2 caused the Arg135 on the tetramerization loop to swap and form a hydrogen bond interaction and salt bridge, respectively, across the two subunits within the binding site (Fig. 5). These polar interacting residues for the collimonin C/D 1, 2 (inhibitor) binding were similar to CoA (product) in other thiolase models31. Therefore, the acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase inhibitions by collimonin C/D 1, 2 are competitive binding models against substrate acetyl-CoA. The stereochemistry of hydroxyl groups on polyynes affects their binding affinity toward acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase The C6 chiral center of collimonin C/D 1, 2 is critical to forming different polar interactions. The C(6)OH of collimonin C 1 had more flexibility concerning the spatial direction (with a dihedral angle to C(7)OH from 109˚ to 170˚) and built a sophisticated polar interaction network with the amide of Pro249 in the pantetheine loop, Arg135, and multiple water molecules (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 36). In contrast, the C(6)OH of collimonin D 2 did not form a polar interaction network at the contrasting face and showed fixed spatial direction (dihedral angle to C(7)OH from 32.9˚ to 42.6˚) (Supplementary Fig. 36). The polar interaction network derived from C(6)OH of collimonin C 1 further affected the distal carboxyl group binding model. Furthermore, the reduced binding strength from the salt bridge (in MasL-collimonin D complex) to the hydrogen bond (in MasL-collimonin C complex) corresponded to their inhibition kinetic, that collimonin D 2 has a lower KI (42.84 μM) than collimonin C 1 (297.10 μM) (Table 1). The above information suggests that the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group on polyynes is vital for initial non-covalent complex affinity. This salt bridge/hydrogen bond formation will dominate the MasL binding affinity in dihydro-type polyynes 1 and 2. Candida albicans ERG10 is the antifungal target of polyynes As the bacterial polyynes target acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase MasL, we further evaluated the inhibition effect of bacterial polyynes on ERG10, an acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase homolog in C. albicans. ERG10 is the first enzyme of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and is crucial for fungal cell membrane formation. The enzyme activity of ERG10 was inhibited by polyynes 1–3 (Supplementary Fig. 37), and correspondingly the overexpression of ERG10 in C. albicans also rescued the cell viability from their inhibition (Fig. 4). Although we did not obtain the X-ray crystallography for the polyyne-ERG10 complex, the mass spectrometry analysis showed that polyynes 1–3 target the reactive Cys90 of ERG10 (Supplementary Fig. 38). A previous study reported that the homologous gene in Aspergillus fumigatus, erg10A is essential for survival and reduced expression leads to increased susceptibility to oxidative and cell wall-perturbing agents33. In the TEM analysis, we also observed that bacterial polyynes disrupted the cell membrane integrity in C. albicans (Supplementary Fig. 39). This result corresponded to the earlier finding that protegencin (or protegenin A) permeated algal cells and caused cell lysis14. Notably, massilin C 5, the analog of protegencin (or protegenin A), possessed antifungal activity against C. albicans (MIC 12.22 μM, Supplementary Fig. 22) and a comparable ERG10 inhibitory potency to polyynes 1–3 (Supplementary Fig. 37). However, neither the heterologous expression of MasL nor ERG10 in C. albicans was able to recover the cell viability under massilin C 5 treatment (Fig. 4). Together these results suggested that the polyynes without a hydroxy moiety would possess multiple antifungal targets.
