3. Results 3.1. Discovery, Isolation and Structural Elucidation of 1 Cultivation of the myxobacterial strain MSr12020 was performed in VY/2 medium with supplementation of adsorber resin XAD-16. The secondary metabolome of MSr12020 revealed—according to our in-house LC–MS metabolome database termed Myxobase [39]—one previously uncharacterized myxochelin congener 1 and the known compounds 2 and 3 (Figure 2). A cultivation volume of 26 L containing bacterial cells and adsorber resin XAD-16 was extracted with acetone followed by liquid–liquid extraction to yield a semi-crude EA and H2O extract. Both extracts were combined and separated via flash chromatography and the fractions containing compounds 1–3 were further purified by semi-preparative HPLC. This resulted in compounds 1 (7.4 mg), 2 (12.2 mg) and 3 (4.9 mg). Compound 1 was isolated as a brown solid with a molecular formula of C24H30N3O9 as observed in the high-resolution mass spectrum (HRMS). A molecular ion of [M+H]+ m/z of 504.1976 and m/z 1007.3858 [2M+H]+ was observed (calculated for 504.1977). The tandem MS (MS2) fragmentation was characterized by m/z 486.19 (C24H28N3O8+, [M-H2O+H]+), 444.21 (C23H30N3O6+), 404.19 (C20H26N3O6+, [M-succinyl+H]+), 387.15 (C20H23N2O6+, [M-succinyl-NH2+H]+), 386.18 (C17H26N3O6+, [M-dihdroxybenzoyl+H]+) due to loss of the dihydroxybenzoyl group), 350.17 (C17H24N3O5+, [M-H2O-dihydroxybenzoyl+H]+), 268.16 (C13H22N3O3+, [M-dihdroxybenzoyl-succinyl+H]+), 251.14 (C13H19N2O3+, [M-dihdroxybenzoyl-succinyl-NH2+H]+), 234.11 (C13H16NO3+), 214.15 (C10H20NO2+, [M-H2O-2×dihydroxybenzoyl+H]+). The UV-VIS absorption of 1 at λmax 212, 250 and 312 nm corresponds to π-π* transition of benzene ring of the dihydroxybenzoyl group [40,41]. The 1H NMR spectrum showed six aromatic protons δH 6.92 (1H, dd, J = 1.45, 7.9 Hz, 4′-H), 6.90 (1H, dd, J = 1.45, 8.0 Hz, 4″-H), 6.70 (1H, dd, J = 7.9, 8.0 Hz, H-5′), 6.68 (1H, dd, J = 7.86, 8.0 Hz, H-5″) 7.18 (1H, dd, J = 1.45, 8.0 Hz, H-6′) and δH 7.21 (1H, dd, J = 1.45, 8.0 Hz, H-6″) whose coupling pattern and coupling constants suggested each ring had three neighboring protons in a 1,2,3 trisubstituted aromatic ring. The 1H NMR spectrum also showed the presence of seven methylene signals δH 3.44 (1H, dd, J = 4.85, 13.8 Hz, H-1), 3.38 (2H, t, J = 7.0 Hz, H-6), 3.29 (1H, dd, J = 7.3, 13.8 Hz, H-1), 2.55 (2H, t, J = 6.85 Hz, H-3‴) 2.44 (2H, m, H-2‴), 1.67 (2H, m, H-3 and 1H, H-5) and δH 1.48 (2H, m, 4-H) and one methine proton δH 4.21(1H, m, H-2). The 13C NMR spectrum was characterized by one acid carbonyl δC 176.8 (C-4‴) and three amide carbonyls 175.5 (C-1‴), 171.8 (C-7″), 171.7 (C-7′), four oxygenated quartenary aromatic carbons δC 150.5 (C-2″), 150.4 (C-2′), 147.5 (C-3′), 147.4 (C-3″), six aromatic methines δC 119.8 (C-5′), 119.7 (C-4′ and C-4″), 119.7 (C-5″), 118.9 (C-6″), 118.7 (C-6′), and two quaternary carbons δC 116.9 (C-1″) and 116.9 (C-1′). In addition, the 13C NMR spectrum also indicated the presence of seven methylenes δC 44.1 (C-1), 40.4 (C-6), 32.6 (C-3), 31.9 (C-2‴), 30.7 (C-3‴), 30.3 (C-5), 24.6 (C-4) and one methine δC 51.2 (C-2) resonance. The presence of two dihydroxybenzamide groups was verified by 1H-1H COSY H-4′/H-5′ and H-5′/H-6′ and 1H-13C H-4′/C-1′,C-2′, C-3′, H-5′/C-1′, C-2′, C-3′, C-6′, C-7′, H-6′/C-1′, C-2′, C-3′, C-4′, C-5′ and C-7′ HMBC correlations. The occurrence of an aliphatic alkyl chain -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH-CH2-partial structure was deduced from the H-1/H-2, H-2/H-3, H-3/H-4, H-5/-H-6 1H-1H correlations. The observed 1H-13C HMBC correlations between the H-6 and C-7″, H-2 and H-C-7′ confirmed the chain being attached to the dihdroxybenzamide at C-7′ and C-7″. The remaining two methylene groups and two carbonyls were assigned to the succinyl amide, inferred from the H-2‴/H-3‴ COSY cross peaks and H-2‴/C-1‴, C-3‴ and C-4‴ and H-3‴/C-1‴and C-4‴ HMBC interactions. It was noted that the succinyl moiety was connected to the aliphatic chain at H-1 based on observed H-1/C-1‴ 1H-13C HMBC interactions (Figure 3). Thus 1 was elucidated as myxochelin-B-succinate based on the similarities with the previously reported siderophore 2. The negative optical rotation and the positive cotton effect observed for 1 (Figure S12) were similar to those observed in naturally occurring and synthetic 2 and 3 -(2S)-isomer [16,17,24,28,42]. 3.2. Bioactivity of 1–3 Compound 3 was reported to be weakly active against a few Gram-positive bacteria, whereas Gram-negative bacteria, yeast and fungi are resistant against 3 [15]. Compound 2 showed antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhumirium [16]. The myxochelin congeners A and B are known to be active against different cancer and tumor cell lines [24,28,40]. The antileukemic activity of the myxochelins can be explained through the inhibition of human 5-lipoxygenase. This well-known drug target [43], which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes is involved in important inflammatory processes [42,44,45]. Compound 1–3 showed no antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative test strains (Table 1), but 1 featured modest antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus (Figure 4) and moderate cytotoxic activity against the tested cancer cell lines being in line with 2 (Table 2). In conclusion, the succinylation of 2 seems to affect its biological activity according to the observed performance in the conducted bioactivity assays. 3.3. Biosynthesis of 1–3 Genomic investigation of the myxobacterial strain MSr12020 led to the identification of a particular myxochelin-like biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that could be responsible for the biosynthesis of the new congener 1 and for the previously discovered compounds 2 and 3. Although the architecture (localization of conserved myxochelin biosynthesis genes and surrounding accessory genes) of the identified genetic locus from MSr12020 deviates from previously investigated myxochelin BGCs (Supplementary Materials, Figure S13), the overall similarity regarding gene sequence identity, suggests a similar biosynthetic pathway leading to 1 and the known congeners 2 and 3 (Figure 5). The myxochelin biosynthesis was elucidated by in vitro reconstitution of the complete biosynthetic pathway using the recombinantly produced core NRPS biosynthetic proteins MxcE–G as well as MxcL in Escherichia coli [18,19,21]. The biosynthesis of the myxochelins is initiated by ATP-dependent activation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) via the standalone adenylation domain MxcE. 2,3-DHBA is then transferred to the carrier protein of the bimodule MxcF, which contains an aryl-carrier protein (ArCP) domain and an isochorismate synthase (IC). Subsequently MxcF transfers two 2,3-DHBA units to MxcG for condensation with both, the α- and ε-side-chain amino groups of the activated lysine. The PCP-bound thioester intermediate is reduced and thereby released from the enzyme complex to yield aldehyde 4 which can undergo NAD(P)-H dependent catalyzed reduction to generate the corresponding alcohol 3 or reductive transamination by MxcL to produce 2 (Figure 5). Based on the elucidated chemical structure of 1—being a succinylated derivative of 2—the presence of a genetically conserved myxochelin BGC and the prolific production of 2 and 3, it is reasonable to propose that 2 is the biosynthetic precursor of 1. Therefore, it seems to be plausible that either a single enzyme is catalyzing the succinylation of 2 to yield 1 or a non-enzymatic reaction of 2 with the reactive intracellular metabolite succinyl-CoA generates 1. Since careful genomic in silico analysis of the identified myxochelin BGC in the myxobacterial strain MSr12020 did not result in a potential co-localized gene candidate, which was expected to encode a transferase responsible for the catalytic conversion of 2 to 1 (Supplementary Materials, Figure S13, Table S5), we performed different in vitro reactions by incubating 2 or 3 with succinyl-CoA or succinate under physiological conditions in order to probe a possible non-enzymatic formation of 1. As expected, incubation of 2 or 3 with succinate did not yield any observable reaction product, whereas incubation of 2 with succinyl-CoA in fact revealed minor production of 1 (Figure 6A). This non-enzymatic reaction was clearly pH dependent, since in vitro reactions performed at pH 5.5 did only show minute amounts of 1, whereas the succinylation rate was highest at pH 10 (Figure 6B). Similar observations considering the pH dependency of non-enzymatic succinylation reactions have been reported previously [46,47]. Compound 3 was not succinylated under the tested conditions, which resembles the finding that we could not observe any myxochelin-A-succinyl derivative in the secondary metabolome of MSr12020. The higher nucleophilicity of the primary amine of 2 compared to the primary alcohol of 3 [48] might provide a reasonable explanation for this observation. Therefore, a possible mechanism for the succinylation of 2 might comprise the nucleophilic attack of a primary amino group on the carbonyl carbon of the succinyl group in succinyl-CoA. Accordingly, an alkaline pH accelerates the formation of a highly reactive cyclic succinic anhydride intermediate, which can react with the primary amine of 2 [49] (Figure 6C). Due to the fact that myxochelin production is prevalent and conserved within the order of Myxococcales, we performed an extended survey investigating the occurrence of 1–3 across myxobacterial taxa, using a previously established collection of high-resolution HPLC-MS datasets from approx. 2600 myxobacterial strains [39]. The chosen parameters to evaluate those MS datasets considering the exact mass (exact mass deviation below 5 ppm), isotope pattern, and retention time matching (retention time deviation below 0.3 min) was adapted from a previous study investigating the presence of myxochelin congeners featuring nicotinic acid moieties [17]. This metabolomic survey revealed that 1 is a commonly observed byproduct of myxochelin B biosynthesis (Figure S14). The observed production titer of 1 displays a great bandwidth from being produced in trace amounts up to an equally produced congener such as 3 (Figure S15). Similarly to the secondary metabolome of MSr12020, we could not observe any molecular ion, which might account for a myxochelin-A-succinyl derivative in these myxobacterial HPLC-MS datasets. It is worth mentioning that the production of iron-chelating myxochelins in myxobacteria is strongly depending on the availability of iron in the fermentation medium; consequently fermentation media supplemented with ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is abolishing myxochelin production [17]. Taken together, these results do not entirely exclude that a tailoring enzyme is catalyzing the formation of 1 (in particular in those observed myxobacterial high producers), however such non-enzymatic succinylations of natural products seem not to be unprecedented as exemplified by the discovery of succinylated derivatives of the subclass IId bacteriocin BacSp222 [47]. Overall, our results indicate that non-enzymatic conversion of 2 seems to be a reasonable route leading to the formation of 1.
