Results Dbv6 and Dbv22 are transcriptional repressors of A40926 biosynthesis N. gerenzanensis mutants defective in dbv6 and dbv22 were constructed as previously reported6 and as described under Material and Methods, respectively. When N. gerenzanensis was grown in a rich medium (RARE3) that affords good growth but moderate glycopeptide production, disruption of dbv6 or dbv22 did not significantly affect biomass accumulation (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, bioassays (Fig. 2B) of culture broth collected along the growth showed that antibiotic production started at 54 h in both mutants (12 h earlier than in the parental strain) and proceeded to higher levels up to 96 h, the last analyzed time point. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of 96-h culture broths showed that the Δdbv6 and Δdbv22 mutants produced 52 and 70 µg/mL acA40926, respectively, in comparison with 34 µg/mL, as observed with the parental strain.Figure 2Growth curves and antibiotic production by N. gerenzanensis wild type, Δdbv6 and Δdbv22 strains in RARE3 medium.

When N. gerenzanensis was grown in a production medium (V40P), the higher production levels of the mutants were confirmed, with the Δdbv6 and Δdbv22 mutants producing 210 and 354 µg/mL acA40926 after 7 days, respectively, in comparison with 130 µg/mL seen in the parental strain (Fig. 3). Interestingly, under these conditions, we observed a small but consistent decrease in biomass accumulation, which was inversely related to the amount of produced glycopeptide. There was no difference in complex composition between the mutants and the wild type (Supplementary Fig. S1), with acA40926 as the main product at all time points in the three strains.Figure 3AcA40926 production and growth in V40P medium of the wild type, Δdbv6 and Δdbv22 strains.

Squares indicate acA40926 concentrations, while triangles represent %PMV. Brown, red and violet symbols correspond to the wild type, Δdbv6 and Δdbv22 strains, respectively. These results demonstrate that Dbv6 and Dbv22 negatively regulate glycopeptide production and their abolition leads to increased antibiotic production, despite a small decrease in biomass, indicating a substantial higher productivity of the mutants (in terms of µg of product per unit of biomass) in comparison to the parental strain. Across two different media, deletion of dbv22 has a more prominent effect than dbv6. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis after 54 h of growth in RARE3 medium of the wild type and the two mutants was carried out to identify the Dbv6/Dbv22 target genes within the dbv cluster (Fig. 4). We focused our attention on ten genes as representatives of all the dbv operons. Besides the regulators dbv3, dbv4 and dbv6, the analysis was carried out on the biosynthetic genes dbv1 and dbv5 (HPG synthesis), dbv23 (mannose acetylation) and dbv15 (MbtH-like protein assisting NRPS action), on the ABC-transporter genes dbv18, and dbv24, and on the resistance gene dbv75,21 (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the results from bioassays and LC-MS analysis, qRT-PCR analysis showed that transcription of some analyzed genes was strongly influenced by deletion of dbv6 and more so by dbv22 genes (Fig. 4). Indeed, the transcriptional levels of dbv3, dbv4, dbv5, dbv23 and dbv24 increased approximately 2–5 fold in the Δdbv6 mutant and 5–20 fold in the Δdbv22 mutant; in contrast, dbv7 was apparently not transcribed in both mutants. The transcriptional levels of dbv1, dbv6, and dbv18 were not influenced by either mutation (Fig. 4).Figure 4qRT-PCR of dbv genes in the wild type and Δdbv6 and Δdbv22 mutant strains. For each gene, data are normalized to the parental strain (blue bars). Red and green bars represent relative RNA levels seen in the Δdbv6 and Δdbv22 strains, respectively. Error bars are calculated from three independent determinations of mRNA abundance in each sample. RNAs were extracted after 54 h of growth in RARE3 medium.

Dbv22 enhances glycopeptide resistance We tested the wild type and the two mutant strains for sensitivity to A40926 and acA40926. Consistent with previous results19, the wild type strain formed no visible colonies when plated on medium containing 4 µg/mL A40926. Remarkably, it was more sensitive to acA40926 than to its desacetylated precursor, with a significant reduction in the ability to form colonies observed already at 0.5–1 µg/mL (Fig. 5). No significant differences between the wild type and the Δdbv6 mutant were observed. In contrast, the Δdbv22 mutant strain was more sensitive to acA40926 and A40926, and it was able to form visible colonies only with up to 0.5 and 0.2 µg/mL of A40926 and acA40926, respectively (Fig. 5). Thus, consistent with qRT-PCR analysis, Dbv22 positively controls resistance to glycopeptides, likely by regulating expression of the carboxypeptidase Dbv7. The lack of an effect on glycopeptide resistance by the dbv6 deletion might be due to the narrow range of glycopeptide concentration in which an effect is seen.Figure 5Resistance assay of the wild type and Δdbv6 and Δdbv22 mutant strains.

A40926 strongly induces expression of dbv genes The above results indicate that N. gerenzanensis can discriminate, in terms of sensitivity, between the highly related glycopeptides A40926 and acA40926. Previous work had also indicated that exogenously added acA40926, but not its desacetylated form, had an inhibitory effect on glycopeptide production2. We thus wondered whether exogenously added glycopeptides would have any effect on the transcriptional levels of the Dbv6/Dbv22 target genes. To this end, a 24 h culture of the parental strain inV40P medium was equally divided into three flasks, with each flask receiving either 0.5 µg/mL A40926, 0.5 µg/mL acA40926 or no addition. After further 2- and 5-h incubation, RNA was extracted and the transcriptional levels of all the regulatory genes (dbv3, dbv4 and dbv6) and of the Dbv6-targeted genes (dbv7, dbv23 and dbv24) were analyzed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 6). Addition of acA40926 had a modest inducing effect on the expression of the regulatory genes dbv4 and dbv6, the resistance gene dbv7 and the acetyltransferase gene dbv23, but only 2 h after compound addition. After 5 h, genes were slightly repressed (dbv3, dbv4, dbv6 and dbv7) or unaffected (dbv23 and dbv24). In contrast, addition of A40926 did not significantly affect transcription levels after 2 h. However, after 5 h all the analyzed genes were induced, with transcription levels 2-fold (for dbv3), 3–6-fold (for dbv4, dbv6 and dbv7) or 13–14-fold (for dbv23 and dbv24) higher relative to uninduced cells. qRT-PCR of the analyzed dbv genes in all three cultures before induction indicated modest flask-to-flask variation (Supplementary Fig. S2).Figure 6qRT-PCR analysis of the gene expression of dbv3, dbv4, dbv6, dbv7, dbv23 and dbv24 in the wild type strain. RNA was isolated from the wild type strain incubated in V40P medium for 2 and 5 h in the presence of 0.5 µg/mL A40926 (black bars) or 0.5 µg/mL acA40926 (red bars). Data are expressed as relative values to the no-addition controls. Within each sample, mRNA levels were normalized to hrdB, arbitrarily setting the ratio for each sample to 1.

Data are expressed as relative values to the no-addition controls. Within each sample, mRNA levels were normalized to hrdB, arbitrarily setting the ratio for each sample to 1. Standard deviations are calculated from three independent determinations of mRNA abundance in each sample. The above experiments were performed using the wild type strain, which does produce acA40926 and related pathway intermediates, with exogenous compounds added during early exponential growth, when glycopeptide levels are below the limit of detection (about 1 µg/mL). When a similar experiment was carried out with the Δdbv4 mutant strain, which does not produce any glycopeptide6, we could not detect any transcription of dbv23 and dbv24, suggesting that these genes might be indirect targets of Dbv4 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, one or more components of the glycopeptide complex or intermediates thereof could exert a positive feedback on the transcription of at least some dbv genes. Direct control of Dbv6 on dbv4 and dbv7 gene expression We investigated whether Dbv6 can bind to the upstream region of the target genes and directly control their expression. Gel mobility shift assays of the regions upstream to dbv3, dbv4, dbv6, dbv7, dbv23 and dbv24 were carried out using a purified His-tagged Dbv6 protein overexpressed in E. coli. These assays did reveal a binding activity of Dbv6 towards the upstream regions of the regulatory genes dbv3 and dbv4, of the resistance gene dbv7, of the genes dbv23-dbv22, coding for the acetyltransferase and the sensor kinase, and of the operon dbv24-dbv28, which encodes an ABC-transporter, two NRPS modules, the N-methyltransferase and the enzyme involved in β-hydroxylation of the tyrosine residue (Fig. 7). No shift was detected using the upstream region of dbv6 (Fig. 7). Control experiments using the internal region of the vegetative sigma factor encoding gene (Supplementary Fig. S4) further confirmed the specificity of DNA binding by Dbv6 observed on some of the target genes. Thus, these data are consistent with Dbv6 directly controlling expression of the target genes. Further studies will be necessary to understand how Dbv6 exerts positive and negative control on different DNA regions.Figure 7Gel mobility shift assays of DNA regions upstream of dbv3, dbv4, dbv7, dbv23, dbv24 and dbv6.

Dbv6 and Dbv22 are unrelated to other TCSs associated with other glycopeptide gene clusters TCSs are often associated with glycopeptide gene clusters, where they have been shown in some cases to play a role in glycopeptide resistance. They appear similar to the well-characterized S. coelicolor VanRS system, which plays a role in glycopeptide resistance in a non-producing strain9. However, reciprocal Blast searches indicate that Dbv6 and Dbv22 are not orthologs of VanRsc and VanSsc, respectively. Inspired by recent work on phylogenetic analysis of cluster-associated StrR- and LuxR-related regulators22, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of TCSs from actinomycetes. To this end, we retrieved response regulators and sensory kinases associated with characterized actinobacterial gene clusters from the MiBIG database23, well-characterized TCSs from Streptomyces coelicolor24,25 and the response regulators and sensory kinases identified in the N. gerenzanensis genome18 (Fig. 8).Figure 8Phylogenetic analysis of 62 response regulators (left panel) and 65 sensory kinases (right panel). Sequences associated with established gene clusters are identified by the compound name followed by the genus of the corresponding strain; characterized S. coelicolor proteins are identified by the protein name followed by the SCO code; and N. gerenzanensis sequences are denoted by the SBO or SBP codes.

With respect to the response regulators, those associated with the balhimycin, teicoplanin and A47934 clusters branch together along with S. coelicolor VanR (Fig. 7, left panel). In contrast, Dbv6 clusters together with response regulators associated with gene clusters for kistamicin A (from a Nonomuraea sp26) and for feglymycin (from a Streptomyces sp27.). Kistamicin A is a partially cross-linked heptapeptide sharing some amino acid residues with glycopeptide antibiotics, whereas feglymycin is a linear tridecapeptide containing several HPG and DPG residues. Both compounds have antiviral activity but modest antibacterial activity in comparison with glycopeptide antibiotics28–30. A similar picture emerges when analyzing the sensory kinases: those associated with the balhimycin, teicoplanin and A47934 clusters, and S. coelicolor VanS form a separate branch from the one containing Dbv22 and the kistamicin A- and flegymycin-associated sequences (Fig. 8, right panel). Interestingly, the adjacent members of two different, uncharacterized TCSs encoded by the N. gerenzanensis genome cluster closely with the Dbv6 and Dbv22 branches, suggesting these proteins might respond to similar stimuli and/or be regulated by similar factors. It should be noted that all the other sensory kinases or response regulators from N. gerenzanensis associated to a putative biosynthetic gene cluster are unrelated to Dbv6 or Dbv22.
