DISCUSSION First isolated in the 1970s from S. tirandis8 and S. flaveolus,9
1 and 2 were originally discovered as bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitors.23 It was not until very recently, 1 and 2 were re-discovered from the marine S. sp. 307-9 during the screen for activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis,10 together with two new congeners, TAM C (9) and D (10), from marine S. sp. SCSIO 166611 in an effort to discover new bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitors, together with TAM C2 (11), and from S. sp. 17944 in our current program to discover BmAsnRS inhibitors as antifilarial drug leads,6 together with the three congeners 3, 4, and 5, previously, and three additional congeners, 6, 7, and 8, in this study. During the characterization of the TAM biosynthetic machinery in S. sp. 307-912 and S. sp. SCSIO 166613,15,16 and in vitro characterization of the TamI P-450 oxygenase,13 a biosynthetic intermediate, 12, was isolated, which unfortunately were given two different names concurrently, TAM F and TAM E. This nomenclature was further complicated by the fact that both TAM F and TAM E were concurrently taken for 3 and 4, respectively, from S. sp. 17944.6 In an attempt to eliminate these confusion, we now propose to reserve TAM E and F for 3 and 4, respectively, and rename 12 as TAM C1 following the precedence of TAM C2 for 11.15 Finally, in vivo characterization of trdE in S. sp. SCSIO 1666 and in vitro study of TrdE resulted in the identification of pre-tirandamycin (13) as the nascent intermediate of the TAM hybrid PKS-NRPS.16 Taken together, a total of 13 TAM congeners have been isolated from the five producers (Figure 1). The cloning and sequencing of the TAM biosynthetic gene cluster from S. sp. 307-912 and S. sp. SCSIO 1666,13,15,16 respectively, opened the possibility to manipulate the TAM biosynthetic machinery for TAM production. The TAM biosynthetic pathway features the TAM hybrid PKS-NRPS for the biosynthesis of 13, which is first dehydrated by TrdE to afford 9 and subsequently oxidized sequentially by TamI and TamL, via the intermediacy of 11/12, 10, and 2, to 1, and this pathway is supported by the isolation of all the proposed biosynthetic intermediates from S. sp. 307-9 and S. sp. SCSIO 1666 wild-type and mutant strains.12–16 In a biosynthetic analogy to S. sp. 307-9 and S. sp. SCSIO 1666, the same pathway for TAM biosynthesis could be proposed in S. sp. 17944, with additional tailoring steps to account for the formation of 3–8 (Figure 1). Thus, while the formation of 3, 4, and 5 from 2 could have resulted from adventitious reductase activities, hydroxylation of 3 to 6 would be consistent with the broad substrate specificity known for TamI.14 The fact that 6 is not detected when 1 is the dominate metabolite and isolated only when 3 is produced in high yield further supports 3, rather than 1, as the likely precursor for 6 (Figures 1 and 2). Bioinformatics analysis of the tam and trd clusters from S. sp. 307-912 and S. sp. SCSIO 166614 has failed to unveil any candidate potentially conferring TAM self-resistance to the producing Streptomyces. Although no gene encoding glucosyltransferase was identified within the cloned tam and trd cluster, it is tempting to speculate that glucosylation may represent one of the resistance mechanisms in S. sp. 17944 as exemplified by the isolation of 7 and 8.22 Finally, TamI plays the fundamental role in catalyzing minimally three steps of oxidations in 1 biosynthesis,12–14 and overexpression of tamI, thereby channeling all the biosynthetic intermediates to completion, therefore represents an outstanding opportunity to engineer a 1 overproducer (Figure 1). Strategies of overexpressing genes controlling rate-limiting steps to alter the metabolic flux or manipulating pathway regulation for titer improvement have been well demonstrated and successfully exploited for the production of targeted metabolites.24–27 Although our success in medium optimization and identification of conditions for S. sp 17944 to produce 1 exclusively with good titer neglects the need to consider genetic approaches to alter metabolic flux and improve metabolite titer, cloning of the tamI gene and development of an expedient genetic system for S. sp. 17944 in the current study certainly set the stage for such endeavor should they be justified by future needs. The discovery of 1 as a novel BmAsnRS inhibitor, which efficiently kills the adult B. malayi parasites and does not exhibit general cytotoxicity to human hepatic cells, underscores the great potential of our innovative HTS targeting BmAsnRS for antifilarial drug discovery.6,7 The microbial origin of these leads promises that they can be produced in sufficient quantities by scale up fermentation and their biosynthetic machinery could be subjected to combinatorial biosynthetic strategies for titer improvement and structural diversity, greatly facilitating follow-up mechanistic and preclinical studies.28 The current study also serves as an excellent reminder that traditional medium and fermentation optimization could remain very effective in improving metabolite flux and titer, as exemplified by the exclusive production of 1 in good titer upon fermenting S. sp. 17944 in the 042 medium. Medium optimization of S. sp. 17944 fermentation also enabled the production, thereby isolation and characterization, of three new TAM congeners, 6, 7, and 8. These new TAM congeners not only shed new insight into TAM biosynthesis and potential mechanisms of resistance, but also further support to the SAR of TAMs – (i) the δ-hydroxymethyl-α,β-epoxyketone moiety is critical for the BmAsnRS inhibitory activity, as highlighted by 1, and (ii) reduction of carbonyl group at C-10, as in 6, or the glucosylation of the hydroxymethyl group at C-18, as in 8, completely abolishes the activity.6
