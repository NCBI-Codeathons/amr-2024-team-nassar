4. Discussion Over the past two decades, investigations on the community structures of archaea and bacteria within saline lakes on the Northern Tibetan Plateau have primarily relied on culture-independent molecular methodologies [94,95,96]. Only three pieces of literature have reported the recovery of cultivable actinobacteria from saline lakes in this region [97,98,99]. Furthermore, earlier studies have highlighted notable differences in bacterial community composition across the Tibetan Plateau at different zones [100,101]. Local geochemical features such as salinity (including salinity-related major ions), pH, and total nitrogen (TN), as well as the geographical distance, were primary factors influencing the variation of bacterial community structures [95,100,101]. In the present study, we collected samples from four distinct saline lakes on the Northern Tibetan Plateau, each separated by considerable distances ranging from 40 to 684 km and situated far away from previously reported saline lakes. The observed heterogeneous biodiversity could be attributed to variations in salinity and pH levels (as shown in Table S1) among different locations. However, the precise mechanisms by which these environmental factors influence the species composition of actinobacteria in these lakes remain unclear. This intriguing subject merits further investigation to deepen our understanding of the intricate relationships between environmental conditions and actinobacterial communities within these unique saline lake ecosystems. It is quite essential to utilize various media for bioprospecting the untapped actinobacterial resources. In the isolation process, eight different culture media were applied, and the modified PYG agar medium (M1) showed the highest recoverability and genera diversity. This finding suggests that M1 is suitable for isolating actinobacteria from saline lake sediments. Supplementing betaine and glycerol in M1 may enhance the microbial antioxidative defense system against salinity stress and contribute to better isolation of rare actinomycetes, as demonstrated in other studies [102,103]. To recover more halotolerant strains, three concentrations of NaCl (0%, 3%, and 5%, w/v) were added to the isolation media. Interestingly, a large number of actinobacteria were isolated using media without NaCl. Possible reasons for this inconsistency could be due to the fact that many halotolerant actinobacteria can tolerate a wide range of salinities and grow well in the absence of NaCl, or that the surface layer of sediment samples has a higher salinity than other parts of the sample. In the MATRIX cultivation step, inhibition activities were observed more frequently in the medium FM4. Medium FM4 contained versatile nitrogen sources such as peptone, yeast extract, and soybean meal, with soybean meal as a slowly-utilizing nitrogen source contributing to prolonged secretion periods and increased yield of antibiotic products [104]. Additionally, the addition of 4% NaCl (w/v) to the FM4 medium may stimulate the growth and metabolism of actinobacteria in the saline environment. Multi-omics approaches have recently made big strides toward the effective exploration of microorganisms, accelerating the discovery of new bioactive compounds. In this research, bioactive components from two Streptomyces strains were comprehensively analyzed with multi-omics strategies. Two types of metabolites belonging to the aromatic polyketide family were unambiguously identified, including anthracyclines (cosmomycin) and angucyclines (kidamycin and hedamycin). The crude fractions extracted from both strains 378 and 549 exhibited an orange-red/red-purple color, displaying absorption within the visible light range of 400â€“500 nm. The chromophore responsible for this distinctive coloration originates from the tetracyclic anthracycline aglycone structure. This unique visible absorption spectrum can serve as a distinguishing marker or probe for the screening of anthracycline and angucycline compounds. Notably, the bacteriostatic effects of cosmomycin, kidamycin, and hedamycin have been reported to arise from their ability to intercalate with DNA in major and minor grooves, inducing DNA breaks via topoisomerase II poisoning [105,106,107,108]. This finding is in accordance with the fluorescence results observed in strains 378 and 549 in the dual-reporter pDualrep2 assay. Interestingly, these aromatic polyketide antibiotics may have a potential biological function in the life cycle of their producing strains inhabiting adverse environments, such as hypersaline environments. Under poor nutritional conditions, the vegetative or substrate mycelia of Streptomyces are inclined to be dismantled by programmed cell death (PCD)-like mechanisms, thereby releasing nutrients to accelerate the buildup of the aerial hyphae [109]. This phenomenon coincides with the accumulation of the anthracyclines that target DNA and protect the nutrient pool from being accessed by other motile competitors [110,111]. On the other hand, cosmomycin, hedamycin, and kidamycin are all optically active dyes with an orange-red/red-purple color. Studies have demonstrated that pigments such as carotenoids, phenazines, quinones, indigoidines, and melanins generally possess antioxidative and ultraviolet-resistant properties that protect bacteria from the detrimental effects of reactive oxygen species and ultraviolet radiation [112,113]. Therefore, it is estimated that these anthracycline and angucycline compounds can offer the producing strains enhanced resistance to oxidative stress and UV radiation on the high-altitude Qiangtang Plateau.
