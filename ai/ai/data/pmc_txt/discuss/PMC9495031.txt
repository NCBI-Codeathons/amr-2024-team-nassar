3. Discussion This work represents the first comprehensive and consistent timeline for antibiotic discovery, development, and resistance. It should prove useful for communicating the alarmingly low number of new antibiotic classes that are reaching the clinic, and we have also shown how the data can be used to identify antibiotic classes for which resistance is more difficult to evolve. Our findings reveal a correlation between pharmacophore novelty and a reduced ‘development window’, and also serve to highlight the importance of prioritizing molecules with expanded ‘resistance windows’ to ensure the long-term safeguarding of antibiotics. By making our data fully available, and our methods transparent, we hope that future researchers can use and adapt our timeline for their own science communication.
