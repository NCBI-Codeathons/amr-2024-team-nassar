Discussion Quantitative (qRT-PCR) expression analysis of cellulose synthase genes (CesA/Csl) The plant cell wall, composed of polyphenolic structures such as lignin and polysaccharides like cellulose, pectin, and hemicellulose, is crucial for the construction of plant biomass and finds applications in various industries, including food, feed, and fuel (Hu et al., 2018; Somerville, 2006; Wang et al., 2012). In addition to providing structural support, the cell wall plays vital roles in plant growth, determining plant shape and cell size, and protecting against environmental stresses (Landrein and Hamant, 2013; Le Gall et al., 2015; Malinovsky et al., 2014). Understanding the genes involved in cell wall formation and reshaping is crucial as they contribute to plant growth, control water movement, regulate cell differentiation, defend against pathogens and pests, and facilitate intercellular adhesion and communication (Heidari et al., 2019). The cellulose synthase gene superfamily, which includes the CesA and Csl gene families, plays a vital role in cellulose and hemicellulose biosynthesis in plants. However, the study of these gene families in tomato plants has been limited. Recently, 38 CesA/Csl family members, containing cellulose synthase domain regions, have been identified and analyzed in tomato plants. Through phylogenetic analysis, these genes have been classified into six subfamilies: CesA, CslA, CslB, CslD, CslE, and CslG. Although most CesA/Csl genes in tomato plants are similar to those found in Arabidopsis, they exhibit distinguishable characteristics in terms of gene structure, chromosome distribution and localization, phylogeny, and protein sequence, indicating that they have evolved through various processes (Song et al., 2019). Understanding the roles and functions of CesA/Csl genes in tomato plants will contribute to our knowledge of cell wall biosynthesis and its regulation. These genes play critical roles in plant growth, cell differentiation, and defense mechanisms against pathogens and pests. By studying the CesA/Csl genes, we can gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell wall formation and the regulation of cell wall-related processes in tomato plants. The studies on TYLCV-infected plants have shown that silencing of Ces genes leads to plant growth arrest, reduced leaf size, and leaf shape distortion, similar to the symptoms caused by TYLCV (Burn et al., 2002; Chu et al., 2007). In RNA-Seq analyses of healthy and TYLCV-infected tomato cultivars, it was observed that the cellulose synthase family gene Csl-H1g043390.2.1, a homolog of the AtCESA8 gene, was highly down-regulated in response to TYLCV infection (Seo et al., 2018). This downregulation of cellulose synthase genes may be an important factor triggering stunted growth and leaf curl in TYLCV-infected plants (Li et al., 2019). However, in our experiments using TYLCV-infected cultivars MK and SH, no downregulation was observed in the 4 CesA/Csl genes used, in contrast to the findings of the previous studies. In the comparison between the 1st and 25th day, it was observed that the Ces-A2 (93 fold change and 117 fold change) and Csl-D3,1 (73 fold change and 3 fold change) genes in the MK genotype, known to be sensitive, and the Ces-A2 gene (115-fold change and 223-fold change) in the SH cultivar showed marked upregulation within 25 days. Transcriptome profiling analyses of TYLCV-infected tomato lines have reported approximately 4-fold upregulation of the Csl gene in TYLCV-resistant breeding lines, and in TYLCV-infected tomato samples, one CesA gene and two Csl genes were significantly upregulated (Chen et al., 2013; Choe et al., 2021). Based on this information, the upregulation of the 4 CesA/Csl genes used in our study, albeit at different levels, in the susceptible MK cultivar with TYLCV infection suggests that these genes play different roles in the complex biotic stress response mechanisms, which could potentially differentiate between sensitive and resistant cultivars. Regardless of the time point difference, the upregulation of these genes indicates their involvement in the plant’s response to TYLCV. TYLCV and ToCV, which exhibit similar symptoms in plant leaves, are believed to be regulated by leaf senescence processes, although the genes involved in the molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown (Espinoza et al., 2007; Seo et al., 2018). In the same study, it was found that the cell wall invertase 2 gene was significantly upregulated after TYLCV infection, suggesting a general defense response in tomato, and this gene was also upregulated in ToCV-infected plants (Seo et al., 2018). In our study, except for the Csl-H1 gene, the other three CesA/Csl genes were significantly upregulated on the 25th day, particularly in the SH cultivar. For instance, in the SH (SWO) cultivar, Ces-A2 showed a 9-fold increase on the 1st day, while it was upregulated by 69-fold on the 25th day. However, in the MK (MWO) cultivar, no significant difference in upregulation was observed between the 1st and 25th day of ToCV infection. Studies have shown that drought stress can affect the content of sugars in plants by inhibiting enzymes involved in cellulose synthesis (Foyer et al., 1998). Mutations in cellulose synthase genes, such as AtCesA8 in Arabidopsis, have been found to lead to increased accumulation of soluble sugars and enhanced drought and osmotic tolerance (Chen et al., 2005). This suggests that cellulose synthesis plays an important role in the response of tomato plants to drought and osmotic stress (Khan et al., 2015). In our study, in the drought-stressed, ToCV and TYLCV-infected SH cultivar, the Csl-D3,1 and Ces-A2 genes showed significant upregulation on the 25th day. However, the upregulation level of the Csl-H1 gene in the same cultivar was lower on the 25th day compared to the 1st day. Similarly, in rice cultivars subjected to drought stress, an increase in the CesA10 gene correlated with improved drought tolerance (Narciso et al., 2010). On the other hand, in the drought-stressed MK cultivar infected with ToCV and TYLCV, no significant upregulation of the 4 genes was observed on the 25th day. This suggests that the MK cultivar, despite being infected with the viruses, did not show a significant correlation with increased drought stress. In a study on susceptible/resistant maize cultivars subjected to drought stress, significant upregulation of 3 CesA genes was observed in the resistant line (Waititu et al., 2021). The comparison of the 1st and 25th days in our study, particularly in terms of the Csl-D3,1 and Ces-A2 genes, suggests the possibility of the SH cultivar exhibiting higher resistance compared to the MK cultivar. These genes may play a role in distinguishing between resistant and sensitive cultivars under drought stress. Physiological analysis of TYLCV and ToCV-infected tomatoes Drought is a significant inhibitor of crop production, including tomatoes, as it affects numerous plant processes and results in a reduction in plant growth. In our current experimental system, tomato plants exposed to water withholding exhibited a dramatic reduction in growth after 10 days. However, grafting of tomato cultivars (MK and SH) with TYLCV and ToCV viruses provided critical protection to the plants from these effects. After 25 days, while the virus-free tomatoes completely wilted and collapsed, the VD plants continued to grow. Harsh environmental stresses, particularly water deficit, influence plant biomass and its distribution on leaflets. When measuring the dry weights of MK and SH cultivars, we observed significant losses in the leaves of healthy-drought plants compared to HW plants. However, the VD tissues lost much less biomass compared to VW plants, both in the case of TYLCV and ToCV inoculated tomato plants. This suggests that virus infection enhances plant endurance under drought stress, and the allocation of leaflet biomass in TYLCV and ToCV-inoculated tomato plants plays an important role in drought adaptation. Physiological water balance parameters measured in healthy and virus-grafted tomato plants also revealed significant differences in response to drought stress (Mishra et al., 2022). Similar results were obtained for RWC, where VD-inoculated variants developed drought tolerance over time, enabling the plants to cope with the stress, while mock-inoculated variants gradually withered. Thus, the combined effect of virus and drought in plants activates the phyto-immune system and promotes plant adaptation to adverse climatic conditions. Similar trends were observed for leaf area in plants exposed to dual stress and mock-inoculated samples, whereas these parameters decreased in VW variants. This confirms that the combined effect of biotic and abiotic stresses triggers plant adaptation mechanisms. Specific leaf weight, which is considered an essential physiological indicator of plants, was found to decrease in VW-affected plants compared to HW plants. On the other hand, the increase in specific leaf weight in VD samples indicates the activation of self-resistance mechanisms in plants, approaching the levels observed in HW plants. The RWC is an indicator of water status in plant cells and is related to drought stress tolerance. In our study, we found that RWC content decreases in HD variants. This is consistent with findings by Sakya et al. (2018), who reported that RWC also decreases during drought stress with an average decrease ranging from 8% to 23%. Additionally, the leaf area was significantly lower under drought stress compared to the control variant, in line with the observations of Zhou et al. (2017), who suggested that the leaf fresh weight of plants significantly decreases under drought and combined stress compared to control plants. Furthermore, the dry biomass of both cultivars showed a significant decrease under drought and combined heat stress compared to the control variant. This is in accordance with findings by Zhou et al. (2017), where the dry biomass of plants was considerably smaller under drought and combined heat stress compared to control plants. The RWC of all cultivars significantly decreased under drought and heat stress compared to control plants (Zhou et al., 2017). The decrease in RWC of tomato plants subjected to drought stress, as shown in Fig. 6, is consistent with the observations of Khan et al. (2015), who reported a decrease in RWC to 89.28% in drought-treated plants compared to control variants. Moreover, RWC values above 75% indicate a normal plant water status even under exposure to drought stress (Patanè et al., 2022). In the study by Tahi et al. (2007), it was found that RWC decreased by about 88% during the experiment, while plant dry biomass and leaf dry mass decreased significantly by about 30%. In our study, we also observed a sharp decrease in leaf area in both MK and SH cultivars under HD conditions. Similarly, leaf area decreased by about 28% in the experimental plants compared to the control. However, in response to water deficit, there was a significant increase in plant growth in both cultivars. We further investigated RWC in TYLCV and ToCV-infected tomato cultivars (MK, SH) and found that RWC reduced sharply in VW variants. Hosseini et al. (2018) suggested that the combined effect of drought stress and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) led to the lowest RWC in the experimental plants compared to mock-inoculated variants. Additionally, dry mass production was enhanced by 20–25% in drought-treated plants (Sand et al., 2018). In TYLCV-infected plants, we observed a significant decrease in leaf area. Sofy et al. (2021) reported a sharp reduction in shoot and root length (40.00% and 35.82%, respectively), as well as in fresh and dry weight biomass in shoots (38.96% and 61.54%, respectively) in ToMV-infected plants compared to water-treated plants. Plants infected with potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) also exhibited smaller leaf area and 30% reduction in dry weight compared to control variants (Mackie et al., 2019). Bergès et al. (2021) found that the vegetative growth of A. thaliana is reduced when infected with cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), but a combination of viral infection and drought stress induces plant growth. Plant cell walls, composed of polyphenolic structures such as lignin and polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose, pectin, hemicellulose), play a crucial role in plant biomass construction and protection against environmental stresses. They provide structural growth support, define plant shape and cell size, and contribute to various industrial fields (Hu et al., 2018; Somerville, 2006; Wang et al., 2012). The present study highlights the correlation between drought and virus stresses. Virus quantity decreased in infected plants exposed to drought (Corrales-Gutierrez et al., 2020). Tomato plants infected by viruliferous whiteflies, as they naturally occur in the field, showed enhanced resistance to drought. Gargallo-Garriga et al. (2014) suggested that enhanced tolerance is due to the reallocation of various basic metabolites from shoots to roots. The interplay between plant viruses and their hosts can evolve from pathogenic to mutualistic interaction under stress conditions (González et al., 2021; Prasch and Sonnewald, 2013). Studies on various viruses and their effects on drought tolerance in host plants, such as Nicotiana benthamiana, have shown delayed drought symptoms in virus-infected plants compared to mock-inoculated plants (Xu et al., 2008). Re-watering of virus-infected beet and rice plants resulted in their recovery from drought stress, indicating the possibility of beneficial interactions. Plants in natural and crop field environments are exposed to multiple environmental stresses, and the responses to simultaneous abiotic and biotic stresses are complex (Garrett et al., 2006). In some cases, abiotic and biotic stresses have synergistic effects. For example, common bean and sorghum plants infected with the fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina exhibit more severe charcoal rot symptoms under drought, with increased drought stress effects in the infected plants (Mayek-Pérez et al., 2002). Similar phenomena have been observed in grape plants infected by the bacterial pathogen Xyllela fastidiosa (McElrone et al., 2001). Field studies have also shown that viral infection and drought stress can have dire consequences for crop loss, with varying additive effects influenced by other environmental variables in the field (McLaughlin and Windham, 1996). Overall, the outcomes of the present study indicate that plants infected with several RNA and DNA genome viruses exhibit better tolerance and survival under drought stress. These plant-virus interactions may be part of the complex mechanisms that plants employ to cope with environmental changes. Virus infection can reduce the size of plant hosts, which can reduce their water requirements and improve survival under extreme drought stress. Virus infection can also lead to physiological modifications in plant tissues, including water content alteration and metabolite synthesis and translocation. For example, CMV infection increased water quantity in above-ground tissues, and infected plants retained water better than mock-inoculated plants (Hull, 2002). The study aimed to investigate the self-regulation ability of tomato plants in tolerating various stresses such as TYLCV and ToCV infections, as well as water deficit and drought. Physiological indicators were examined, and pathogen-related transcriptional changes were analyzed alongside the recovery process. Ultimately, the research aimed to understand the mechanisms underlying drought stress tolerance in tomato plants to prevent yield loss and address the potential impact of environmental changes. The results of this study suggest that the combined effects of biotic and abiotic stresses play a crucial role in mitigating the negative consequences of drought and viral infections caused by TYLCV and ToCV. Furthermore, these combined stressors were observed to expedite the recovery time of tomato plants after rehydration. This finding is significant because it implies that by understanding the underlying mechanisms supporting drought stress tolerance, it may be possible to prevent yield losses in tomato crops, which hold immense economic and commercial value. In practical terms, several tomato cultivars or hybrids carrying resistance genes to TYLCV-causing viruses are currently being cultivated in extensive areas to minimize the impact of yield losses. This cultivar selection approach aligns with the findings of this study, reinforcing the validity of studying the self-regulation ability of tomato plants in response to multiple stressors. Given the economic importance of tomato crops and the imminent environmental changes, understanding the mechanisms behind stress tolerance in tomato plants is essential. This knowledge will enable researchers and farmers to implement effective strategies for preserving crop yield under challenging environmental conditions. By embracing this research, the agricultural industry can strive for sustainable practices and secure the future of tomato production. The commercialization of tomato fruits heavily relies on cultivars resistant to viral infection. However, it is important to note that these cultivars do not develop immunity against viral infection; rather, they only exhibit systemic infection with mild symptomatology. This crucial information was highlighted by Marchant et al. (2020), emphasizing that although resistant cultivars may still succumb to viral infections, the symptoms are much milder than in susceptible cultivars. To supplement this knowledge, Czosnek (2021) provided insights into the pathophysiological behavior of TYLCV-resistant tomato lines under water shortage conditions. Their research shed light on how these resistant plants respond to abiotic stress, particularly water scarcity, while still maintaining their resistance against the viral infection. Expanding on this research, it would be beneficial to explore the resistance mechanisms of other host plants against different epidemic DNA and RNA genome viruses under various abiotic stresses. This deeper understanding of the perception and interaction between biotic and abiotic stress factors can significantly contribute to global knowledge on plant defense mechanisms. By elucidating how plants respond to both types of stress simultaneously, future genetic agronomic applications can be developed to enhance crop resilience in challenging environments. In summary, the cultivation of resistant tomato cultivars against viral infection has allowed for the commercialization of tomato fruits. However, these cultivars do not develop immunity, but rather exhibit mild symptomatology. Further research on the resistance mechanisms of host plants to various viral infections under different abiotic stresses will advance our understanding of the combined effects of biotic and abiotic stressors and provide valuable insights for future genetic agronomic applications. TYLCV and ToCV are two common pathogens that significantly impact tomato production. In this study, we utilized the susceptible MK and the Shalala cultivar (susceptibility or resistance status unknown) to conduct single-leaflet grafting with TYLCV and ToCV. By subjecting the plants to virus infection and drought stress, we aimed to investigate the potential effects on water parameters in the leaves and assess their recovery compared to healthy plants. To gain insight into the plant’s response to the combined stress, we employed qRT-PCR to detect antivirus-related genes or pathways. Specifically, we focused on measuring the expression levels of cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like genes, as their biosynthesis is known to play a crucial role in the defense mechanisms of tomatoes against TYLCV and ToCV. According to our experiments, we have observed certain physiological parameters and gene expressions that lead us to hypothesize that the plant recovery process in both cultivars, MK and SH, cannot be disregarded when considering the effect of combined stress. These findings contribute to a wider understanding of the interplay between host plants and viruses during periods of drought stress, shedding light on the molecular-genetic mechanisms that govern plant adaptation to the simultaneous impacts of biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. The implications of our research extend beyond the realm of academia, particularly within the current context of climate change. As water scarcity becomes a pressing concern in many regions, it is imperative to develop agricultural practices that can sustain crop growth despite limited water availability. By delving into the intricate relationship between plants, viruses, and drought stress, our work provides valuable insights that can aid in the formulation of new agronomic strategies customized for water-scarce areas. Moreover, our study paves the way for future investigations that aim to explore the dual effects of viruses and additional abiotic stressors on plants. By unraveling the complex interactions between multiple stress factors, we can gain a deeper understanding of plant resilience and uncover novel approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of environmental challenges on crop productivity. In conclusion, our research contributes to the expanding knowledge base surrounding plant-virus interactions during drought stress. By elucidating the molecular-genetic mechanisms of plant adaptation to combined stressors, our findings offer valuable insights for combating water scarcity in agriculture. Ultimately, this work serves as a catalyst for further advancements in the field, inviting future research that explores the multifaceted challenges posed by viruses and abiotic stressors on plant health and productivity.
