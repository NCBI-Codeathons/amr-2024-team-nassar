Discussion Secondary metabolites are generally toxic to their producers. The cytotoxicity of doxorubicin can inhibit the growth of S. peucetius and hinder product production. In our study, S. peucetius was continuously cultivated in seed medium containing doxorubicin, which made the strains more tolerant to the toxicity of their own products. By adaptive evolution, the resulted S. peucetius SIPI-7-14 showed higher biomass and doxorubicin yield than that of S. peucetius SIPI-14. The high-yielding strains can be used as better cell factories for doxorubicin production. To further increase the product tolerance, overexpression of resistance genes is another widely applied approach. Cellular resistance in S. peucetius is mediated by genes, including drrA, drrB, drrC and drrD (Karuppasamy et al. 2015). An efflux pump composed of the proteins drrA and drrB removes doxorubicin from cells (Kaur 1997). Like UvrA, the protein drrC may recognize and eliminate daunorubicin, which is embedded in DNA, thus allowing DNA replication and transcription to continue (Prija and Prasad 2017). Expression of drrC in the Escherichia coli uvrA strain can significantly increase the daunorubicin resistance of the strain (Lomovskaya et al. 1996). Directly downstream of drrA and drrB lies drrD, which is involved in self-resistance as well. S. peucetius drrD deletion mutant showed reduced self-resistance, but the molecular mechanism has not yet been known (Karuppasamy et al. 2015). In our study, overexpression of drrA and drrB resulted in an increase in the production of doxorubicin. In addition, overexpression of the resistance gene drrC produced 1128 mg/L doxorubicin, a 102.1% increase compared to that of SIPI-14. However, the combination of the genes drrA, drrB and drrC did not result in a greater yield than did the overexpression of drrC alone. This phenomenon is consistent with the findings of previous reports in the literature, in which the expression of both resistance systems was shown to be worse than the expression of an individual resistance system (Malla et al. 2010b). We have also tried to overexpress drrD in △U1, but the strain showed almost the same productivity as the parental strain. Secondary metabolites can generally be enhanced by deleting genes of competing pathways. In the pathway of doxorubicin biosynthesis, the dnrU coding product can catalyze daunorubicin to produce byproducts, while the dnrH and dnrX coding products can use daunorubicin and doxorubicin to produce baumycin analogs. It was reported that in S. peucetius 29,050, blocking the dnrU and dnrX increased the yield of doxorubicin by three times, compared with that of the parent strain. Inactivation of dnrH led to an 8.5-fold increase in daunorubicin production and doxorubicin production also increased (Lomovskaya et al. 1998, 1999; Scotti and Hutchinson 1996). In this study, gene dnrU was disrupted in the S. peucetiuss SIPI-7-14 and the yield of doxorubicin was 21.5% greater than that of the parent strain. However, the higher fold enhancement reported in the literature may be due to the low yield of the original strain. Surprisingly, after deletion of the branch genes dnrH and dnrX, the yield of doxorubicin decreased instead, which is inconsistent with the findings of previous reports. The biomass of the engineered strain △H4 and △X1 decreased compared to that of the parental strain SIPI-7-14, from 15 to 11% and 12%, respectively. We speculated that the toxicity of doxorubicin is higher than the glycosylated product baumycin, which has a great effect on the growth of S. peucetius. The baumycin is sensitive to acid and can be easily converted into doxorubicin by adjusting the pH to 1.5–1.8, so it will not affect the doxorubicin yield. These results indicate that there is a significant difference in the results of genetic engineering modification between high-yielding strain and wild-type strain. As the genetic background of strains changed after genetic engineering, it is necessary to optimize the medium or culture conditions to explore the production potential of engineered strains. This phenomenon has also been found in other strains(Li et al. 2022; Wan et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2023b). RSM was widely used to design experiments and determine the optimal medium with fewer experimental trials and obtain more responses at the same time. The medium obtained through RSM method was better than previously reported single-factor optimization. The production of doxorubicin reached 1406 mg/L in the shake flask on the 7th day, which was 24.6% higher than before. In conclusion, the yield of doxorubicin can be effectively improved by combination of resistance screening, genetic engineering and optimization of culture media, a 150.6% increase compared with the parent strain SIPI-14, which was the highest reported so far (Table 2). This will make it possible to produce doxorubicin through one-step fermentation instead of existing chemical semi-synthetic production method. Meanwhile, some other products derived from actinomyces fermentation can also use this strategy to improve the fermentation yield.
