4. Discussion In this study, FtsZ was identified as the intracellular target of AP-3 in A. pretiosum. It was initially believed that AP-3 is not toxic to bacteria, because tubulin does not exist in bacteria. However, since the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ was reported to have a similar structure to tubulin, it was inferred that FtsZ might be a target of AP-3 [7,8,9]. In this study, structures of FtsZ from A. pretiosum and β-tubulin from Bos taurus were compared and shown to be structurally similar to each other [18]. In a subsequent in vitro interaction test, it was validated that AP-3 could bind to FtsZ and inhibit FtsZ assembly. This is the first time that the bacterial target of AP-3 has been identified. Our further experiments found that AP-3 could also inhibit the assembly of FtsZ from Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces coelicolor (Figure S8), indicating that the inhibition of AP-3 on FtsZ is not limited in Actinosynnema but broadly applicable among bacteria. Some antitumor antibiotics also showed cell toxicities towards their bacterial producers [24,25,26]. During the production of antitumor tiancimycin A, for example, its accumulation was extremely toxic to its producer Streptomyces sp. CB03234, and the yield was only 0.2 mg/L [27]. In this study, it was observed that exogenous AP-3 at a concentration higher than 300 mg/L caused severe inhibition on the growth of WXR-24 (Figure 1c and Table S2). Improving strain resistance has been widely used to enhance the yields of various antibiotics, such as oxytetracycline [28], doxorubicin [29], rimocidin [30], daptomycin [31] and toyocamycin [32]. However, these strategies mainly focus on overexpressing efflux genes or engineering resistance genes. As another option, overexpressing the drug targets has also been long used to alleviate cell toxicities and improve resistance [33]. For example, the overexpression of embAB genes, coding for the targets of the antimycobacterial compound ethambutol (Emb), resulted in Emb resistance [34]. The overexpression of FDP synthase, target of aminobisphosphonate (aBP) drugs, improved resistance of aBP drugs in Dictyostelium amoebas [35]. In our study, overexpression of the AP-3 target FtsZ improved both strain resistance and AP-3 production, showing again that the overexpression of target proteins is an effective way to enhance antibiotic production. FtsZ plays a fundamental role in cell division of bacteria. Before cell division, a ring-like structure is formed in the middle of the dividing cell by FtsZ polymerization, which then recruits other related proteins to start the dividing program [9]. Increased expression of ftsZ often results in change of cell morphology. For example, in B. subtilis and E. coli, ftsZ overexpression will cause asymmetric cell division [36,37], while in C. glutamicum an increase in cell diameter is observed [38]. Improved expression of ftsZ in S. coelicolor and S. lividans inhibited aerial mycelia and spore formation, and antibiotic production was increased [39]. In our study, it was found the length of the branching hyphae in the ftsZ-overexpressing mutant WXR-30 was much shorter than the control strain (Figure S6). The result is in accordance with the work in S. venezuelae, in which highly branched mycelia were found in the ftsZ mutant [40]. The relationship between mycelial morphology and AP-3 resistance or production needs further investigation. The cell toxicity of AP-3 on its producer A. pretiosum was less pronounced than on eukaryotic cells. In fact, the IC50 of AP-3 on MCF-7 cells is 20 ± 3 pmol/L, which is much lower than that on A. pretiosum (315.0–472.4 μmol/L). The binding force of AP-3 with FtsZ (KD = 3.36 × 10−4 M) (Table S4) is also obviously weaker than that with β-tubulin (KD = 1.3 × 10−6 M). As shown in Figure 4d, three hydrogen bonds are formed between AP-3 and Gly129, Asn173 and Gln169 on FtsZ, with bond lengths of 3.1, 5.9 and 3.9 Å, respectively. In comparison, five hydrogen bonds are formed between maytansine and Gly100, Asn102, Lys105, Asn101 and Val181 on β-tubulin, with bond lengths of 3.1, 3.2, 2.5, 3.3 and 2.9 Å, respectively. As hydrogen bonding is relatively strong among intermolecular interactions [41], the interaction between AP-3 and β-tubulin is therefore much stronger than that with FtsZ, which explains the toxicity of AP-3 towards A. pretiosum only at high concentrations. Although the resistance of WXR-30 was substantially improved (Figure 4a), the strain was still sensitive to 300 mg/L and 400 mg/L AP-3, which implies that FtsZ overexpression could not fully confer resistance to AP-3. From our docking analysis, five key amino acid residues, namely Pro92, His96, Gly129, Gln169 and Asn173, were proposed to interact with AP-3 (Figure 4d). Therefore, these key residues, especially Gly129, Gln169 and Asn173 forming hydrogen bonds with AP-3, will be considered for future mutagenesis to further alleviate or even abolish the interactions and consequent cell toxicity.
