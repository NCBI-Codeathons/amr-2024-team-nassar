Then E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were used as the test strain to examine the relationship between sacH-expression and the resistance against SAC-B. The results showed that the survival ratio of sacH-expression strain did not decrease with the increase of SAC-B concentration, compared with the control strain containing vector pET28a (Fig.Â 2F). These collective results unambiguously supported that SacH, the DHFR-like protein, endows host cells resistance to SAC-B for self-protection via reductive inactivation of not only the end-product but also the hemiaminal pharmacophore-containing biosynthetic intermediate."

BCI2's high tolerance for 9-methoxyrebeccamycin implies a resistance mechanism on the pBCI2-2 plasmid. The integral membrane transporter RebT, a putative efflux pump in the major facilitator family, has been shown to confer rebeccamycin resistance when heterologously expressed in an otherwise sensitive Actinomycete, Streptomyces albus.15 A distinct member of this transporter family is encoded in both the BCI2 9-methoxyrebeccamycin and eDNA AB857 clusters (Figure 2B, brown shaded arrows) and is the most likely candidate for self-resistance. An uncharacterized putative transporter gene, rebU, is also present in all three clusters and could also contribute to resistance."

We observed that S. marcescens Db10 produced a diffusible metabolite able to inhibit the growth of Bacillus subtilis. A cluster of six genes encoding a hybrid NRPS-PKS assembly line, two tailoring enzymes and a putative self-resistance protein were identified as responsible for production of the antimicrobial. In antibiotic producing organisms, resistance genes are commonly located within the antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster [34]. We therefore hypothesised that Alb1 was required for self-resistance to althiomycin and/or export of althiomycin from the cell into the surrounding environment. We predicted that if alb1 was essential for self-resistance, it might not be possible to make an althiomycin-producing alb1 mutant due to lethality."
