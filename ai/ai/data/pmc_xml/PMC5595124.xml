Biosynthesis is performed by polyketide synthases (PKSs), and the acyl carrier protein (ACP), a small acidic protein, that transports the growing polyketide chain and is essential for activity. Here we report the synthesis of two aromatic probes and a linear octaketide mimic that have been tethered to actinorhodin ACP. These experiments were aimed at probing the ACP's capacity to sequester a non-polar <italic>versus</italic> a phenolic aromatic ring (that more closely mimics a polyketide intermediate) as well as investigations with extended polyketide chain surrogates. The binding of these mimics has been assessed using high-resolution solution NMR studies and high-resolution structure determination. These results reveal that surprisingly a PKS ACP is able to bind and sequester a bulky non-polar substrate containing an aromatic ring in a fatty acid type binding mode, but the introduction of even a small degree of polarity favours a markedly different association at a surface site that is distinct from that employed by fatty acid ACPs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Actinorhodin <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) produced by the archetype type II polyketide synthase from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>, is an aromatic polyketide antibiotic that has served as a paradigm for the genetic, mechanistic and structural elucidation of aromatic polyketide biosynthesis.<sup><xref rid="cit1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> It is produced by a type II polyketide synthase, derived from a cluster of genes (23 in total) coding for each of the biosynthetic, self-resistance and export proteins associated with the actinorhodin pathway. Both studies <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> have shown that proteins encoded by <italic>actI</italic> (KS/CLF and ACP) form a minimal PKS<sup><xref rid="cit5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> that catalyses the generation of the full length polyketide chain 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Successive reductive (<italic>actIII</italic>, KR), cyclisation/aromatisation (<italic>actVII</italic>, ARO/CYC) and further tailoring steps then complete the biosynthesis. Whereas these latter tailoring steps follow a simpler enzyme&#x02013;substrate model, the initial chain elongation steps involve precisely seven iterative decarboxylative condensations of seven malonate units with a malonate derived acetate unit primer to give the desired chain length.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Proposed biosynthetic pathway to actinorhodin <bold>1</bold>.

The minimal PKS also partially controlled the C7&#x02013;C12 ring closure to yield SEK4 as well as a mis-cyclised product formed from the C10&#x02013;C15 ring closure (SEK4b).<sup><xref rid="cit6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Ketide units are depicted in the keto-forms although these are likely to be a mixture of keto&#x02013;enol tautomers.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="c5sc03864b-f1"/></fig><p>Studies of type II FAS ACPs with fully reduced<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> or partially reduced fatty acids<sup><xref rid="cit9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> have revealed deep sequestration of the intermediate by the ACP and concomitant structural changes in the protein that may assist in modulating protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Conversely the rat FAS type I ACP bearing a fully reduced fatty acid chain showed no interaction of the protein with the fatty acid side-chain by NMR as evidenced by no observable NOEs or chemical shift perturbations in <sup>1</sup>H&#x02013;<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra.<sup><xref rid="cit10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This has provided a useful yardstick to define the opposite ends of these two extremes. Very little is actually known about the mechanism by which a linear polyketide is successfully stabilised and transferred from the KS/CLF to the next enzyme in the sequence, <italic>actIII</italic> KR. Primarily this is because the ACP-bound labile intermediates are not isolatable and we lack suitable stable chemical mimics to serve as probes for these critical elongation steps. The ideal side chains to study ACP-intermediate interactions would be the true polyketide intermediates but the intrinsically high reactivity of the native or postulated intermediates makes them unsuitable for structural studies and they are synthetically intractable. We have previously probed the structural role of act PKS ACP in binding and protection of the nascent polyketide using solution state NMR and acylated ACPs derived from chemically synthesised coenzyme A (CoASH) derivatives.<sup><xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> To generate more stable mimics we utilised polyketide analogues that employ strategically removed carbonyls but retain essential features such as flexibility of the intermediate and chain polarity. A terminal enone moiety is incorporated to allow Michael addition of the free sulfhydryl group of CoASH to generate a stable thioether group. The intermediate and the 4&#x02032;-phosphopantetheine (4&#x02032;-PP) portion of CoASH is then transferred to the target ACP using ACPS.<sup><xref rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Using this strategy we were able to provide evidence that short diketide and triketide mimics show a weak association with the act PKS ACP<sup><xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and associated conformational exchange within the protein. NMR studies with emodin, a putative mimic of actinorhodin, have also suggested association with the ACP.<sup><xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>
</p><p>All previous studies of early pathway intermediate analogues have, however, focused on short linear polar or non-polar chains, which surprisingly are sequestered by a PKS ACP. They have not addressed whether the ACP plays any role in interacting with longer or monocyclic intermediates that more closely resemble the critical assembly junctures in type II polyketide biosynthesis. Many questions remain unanswered. (1) The ACP's true role in stabilising longer polyketide chains is unknown. (2) The timing of the first ring cyclisation is speculated to occur on the KR<sup><xref rid="cit14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and does the ACP bind the resulting reduced cyclised product <bold>3</bold>? Finally (3) what is the nature of the interaction of the ACP with these intermediates and will the &#x02018;right&#x02019; intermediate show full sequestration like a fatty acid or does the true picture lie somewhere between this and the completely unbound model observed in type I FAS systems?<sup><xref rid="cit15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>
</p><p>Here we report the synthesis and structural characterisation of two aromatic derivatives and a linear octaketide surrogate covalently bound to the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> actinorhodin (act) PKS ACP.

Although the phenyl ring is completely buried in the protein cavity, the remaining backbone of the 5-phenyl-3-oxo-pentyl derivative is largely unprotected and the 3-keto group is blocked at the entrance of the cavity and lies at the surface of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Structural ensembles and representative model for 5-phenyl-3-oxo-pentyl ACP <bold>7</bold>.

</title><p>Having demonstrated the internal cavity of act ACP is able to expand and absorb a single phenyl group, we next determined whether incorporation of a greater degree of polarity would be accommodated in the same way or drive an alternative binding mode. To achieve this the phenolic CoASH derivative <bold>15</bold> was synthesised to explore whether the introduction of a single hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring would reduce or enhance binding to the ACP. Secondly an extended linear chain in the form of a 3,7-dioxo-octyl group was conjugated to CoASH to give <bold>19</bold>. This extended our previous studies to longer intermediates and tested whether increased chain length enhanced ACP binding, potentially through the selective binding of the hydrophobic face of the polyketide.</p><p>For the phenolic ACP <bold>16</bold>, protection of commercially available 3-bromophenol as silyl ether <bold>8</bold> followed by a Sonogashira cross-coupling with 3-butyn-1-ol gave alcohol <bold>9</bold> in 76% yield over the two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch2">Scheme 2A</xref>). Reduction of the alkyne to <bold>10</bold> followed by Swern oxidation gave aldehyde <bold>11</bold> which on treatment with vinylmagnesium bromide gave allylic alcohol <bold>12</bold>. Acid hydrolysis of the TBS ether gave <bold>13</bold>, which was oxidised with MnO<sub>2</sub> to give the desired enone <bold>14</bold> albeit in low yield. The reactivity of this enone towards Michael addition with thiols was first tested using propanethiol to avoid unnecessary consumption of expensive CoASH. This reaction proceeded cleanly within 1 h by NMR and could also be carried out in water without loss of reactivity or selectivity. These conditions were then used to tether the enone to CoASH to give <bold>15</bold> and then to the ACP to yield <bold>16</bold>.</p><p>For the synthesis of <bold>20</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch2">Scheme 2B</xref>), treatment of the &#x003b4;-hexalactone with vinylmagnesium bromide gave alcohol <bold>17</bold>.

We observed CSPs relative to holo-ACP for both analogues although the magnitude of the changes was reduced compared to the CSPs observed with 5-phenyl-3-oxo-pentyl ACP. This indicated that that sequestration within the cavity of the ACP and concomitant conformational changes in the protein were reduced, suggestive of a transient, possibly surface interaction with the protein. In fact a second conformation was observed for 3,7-dioxo-octyl ACP <bold>20</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>) with chemical shifts of the minor form suggestive of shallow binding similar to that observed in butyryl act ACP<sup><xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Based on these observations we calculated the three-dimensional structure of 3,7-dioxo-octyl ACP by solution state NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>, see ESI Table S2<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>). This structure corresponded to the major conformer (with the smallest CSPs) as the minor conformations were not in sufficient concentrations for NOEs to be observed. For the major conformer we observed numerous NOEs within the 4&#x02032;-PP side-arm (methylenes H6&#x02032;&#x02032; and H9&#x02032;&#x02032;, see ESI Fig. S2<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref>) which were not observed in holo-ACP but were also detected when the ACP was previously derivatised with shorter non-polar side-chains.<sup><xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In addition 4&#x02032;-PP &#x02013; protein NOEs were observed from Leu 43 and Met 46. No NOEs could be observed to the 3,7-dioxo-octyl group. Nonetheless the NOEs that were observed were sufficient to define the topology of the 4&#x02032;-PP sidearm which extends away from the ACP then folds back on itself to bring the thioether linkage close to helix two. This association is likely to be stronger in the two other sub-states that show greater protein CSPs and suggest the ACP is sensitised to the polar cargo and confers modest sequestration of the substrate, most likely by binding weakly along the charged groove between helices two and three (at the surface, rather than buried). Weak NOEs were observed previously from a short triketide analogue and emodic acid,<sup><xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> a surrogate for a more highly elaborated actinorhodin scaffold, to residues in helix two in act ACP. In addition binding has been detected in act ACP bearing longer polyketide mimics utilising carbonyl replacement. These studies combined molecular modeling and CSPs observed in helix three to suggest that residency of the polyketide mimic on the ACP increased in line with the length and degree of cyclisation of the polyketide.<sup><xref rid="cit18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>

The weak interaction with the phenolic derivative is however in stark contrast to the burial of the phenyl ring indicating that the introduction of the single hydroxyl group is sufficient to drive an exclusion of the phenolic group from within the binding cavity to a weaker interaction at the surface of the ACP.</p><p>The work of our group and others<sup><xref rid="cit18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="cit19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> now provides clear evidence that polyketide ACPs sequester their intermediates through a binding mode that is quite distinct from that employed in fatty acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Why is fatty acid sequestration important in fatty acid biosynthesis? The binding cavity employed by type II FAS ACPs offers some protection from thioester hydrolysis which has been shown to increase in rate as the fatty acid exceeds &#x0223c;14 carbons in length and outgrows the capacity of the ACP cavity although <italic>in vitro</italic> C<sub>18</sub>-ACP preparations of these ACPs are stable for many days.<sup><xref rid="cit20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Burial of the fatty acid requires &#x02018;chain-flipping&#x02019; of the fatty acid from the dynamic ACP to the more static fatty acid synthase enzymes (KS, KR, DH and ER) where neither association can be too stable as it would hinder the next flip.<sup><xref rid="cit21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> By comparison, a model for the initial steps of polyketide biosynthesis involves the stabilisation of the polyketide by the catalytic KS/CLF during chain elongation to a precisely controlled chain length.<sup><xref rid="cit22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The active site is tube-like and located at the interface of the two domains.<sup><xref rid="cit23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The elongated geometry of the site may assist in preventing unwanted spontaneous cyclisations and the amphipathic nature of this region may complement the nascent polyketide with suitable stabilising interactions, <italic>e.g.</italic> select ketide groups of the intermediate may be enolised to interact with two backbone carbonyls and a carboxylate side chain present in the amphipathic tunnel. In addition, a water molecule in the active tunnel may also play a role in stabilising the polyketide intermediate by donating a hydrogen bond to a ketone group. Once the mature polyketide has reached the correct length, a suitably strong interaction with the ACP might trigger dissociation with the ACP providing a suitably polar, but shallow cavity. The partial sequestration of the polyketide may be sufficient to act as a solvent shield during transit to the KR. Within the complex milieu of the bacterial cell, the KR may of course be associated with the KS/CLF as a non-covalent complex requiring minimal translocation.<sup><xref rid="cit24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Our results taken together with related studies<sup><xref rid="cit18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> suggest that the ACP offers a degree of protection but in the absence of the next (<italic>i.e.</italic> KR) synthase component, the formation of SEK4b occurs, <italic>via</italic> an off-pathway C10&#x02013;C15 cyclisation. In the normal pathway, the correctly C7&#x02013;C12 cyclised product is then reduced to alcohol <bold>2</bold> by the KR and blockage of biosynthesis at this point leads to the formation of mutactin.<sup><xref rid="cit25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>

The association is strong enough to induce multiple conformers in the ACP when the polyketide chain is of sufficient length and contains polar atoms. These polar intermediates do not however induce the large cavity opening we observed when act ACP was derivatised with non-cognate fatty acids and the role, if any, of this potential internal hydrophobic pocket remains elusive. The observed association of the 4&#x02032;-PP chain with the ACP would still therefore require a degree of chain flipping involving dissociation from the ACP surface prior to insertion into the active site of the next synthase partner in the biosynthetic sequence. This may be more easily or rapidly achieved in the case of a surface associated polyketide intermediate <italic>versus</italic> a strongly bound fatty acid within a FAS ACP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to gratefully acknowledge the BBSRC. for financial support (BB/F014570/1 and BB/I003355/1).</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="cit1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Malpartida</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hopwood</surname><given-names>D.
