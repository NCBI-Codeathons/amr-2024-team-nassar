However, the extensive usage of these antibiotics has resulted in the rapid development of bacterial resistance. The resistance mechanisms mainly include mutations of the rifamycin target RNA polymerase of bacteria and enzymatic modifications of rifamycin antibiotics. One modification is the recently characterized rifamycin degradation catalyzed by Rox enzymes, which belong to the widely occurring flavin monooxygenases. Intriguingly, our recent sequence analysis revealed the rifamycin producers also encode Rox homologs that are not yet characterized. In this work, we expanded the study of the Rox-catalyzed rifamycin degradation. We first showed that the Rox proteins from rifamycin producers have the enzymatic rifamycin SV-degrading activity. Then we used the structurally diverse rifamycin compounds rifampicin and 16-demethylrifamycin W to probe the substrate scope and found that they each have a slightly different substrate scope. Finally, we demonstrated that Rox proteins can also catalyze the transformation of 16-demethylsalinisporamycin to 16-demethylsaliniketal A. Since 16-demethylsalinisporamycin and 16-demethylsaliniketal A are the counterpart analogs of salinisporamycin and saliniketal A, our biochemical findings not only uncover a previously uncharacterized self-resistance mechanism in the rifamycin producers, but also bridge the gap between the biosynthesis of the potential antitumor compound saliniketal A.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rifamycin degradation</kwd><kwd>Rox enzyme</kwd><kwd>flavin monooxygenase</kwd><kwd>self-resistance</kwd><kwd>saliniketal</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="22"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rifamycins (Rifs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) are broad-spectrum antibiotics with potent antibiotic activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Floss and Yu, 2005</xref>). Their semi-synthetic derivatives, such as rifampicin, have long been mainstay components for the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, and AIDS-associated mycobacterial infections (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Floss and Yu, 2005</xref>). Rif antibiotics target bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RNAPs), and thus inhibit RNA transcription (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>). The crystal structure determination of the <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic> core RNAP complexed with rifampicin revealed a pocket for Rif binding to the RNAP &#x003b2; subunit (RpoB) deep within the DNA/RNA channel (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>). For example, the four hydroxyl groups of Rif (at C-1, C-8, C-21, and C-23) form critical hydrogen bonds with RpoB. This strong interaction indicates that the antibiotic can effectively block the exit path for the newly-synthesized RNA (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>). However, the extensive usage of these antibiotics has resulted in the rapid development of bacterial resistance, and thus this class of antibiotics are commonly used in drug combinations (e.g., with isoniazid) and are restricted in treating tuberculosis or clinical emergencies so as to guarantee a relatively long lifespan of utility (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Floss and Yu, 2005</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Rox enzyme-catalyzed degradation of Rif antibiotics.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-11-00971-g001"/></fig><p>The mode of action predicts the antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Indeed, the majority of mutations to Rif resistance have been mapped to the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, as well as other microbes examined (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Floss and Yu, 2005</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene mutation also occurs in the Rif producer <italic>Amycolatopsis mediterranei</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Floss and Yu, 2005</xref>). On the other hand, enzyme-catalyzed modifications of rifamycin antibiotics have been widely identified in environmental and pathogenic bacteria. Known enzymatic modifications mainly include the ADP-ribosylation on the hydroxyl group of C-23 catalyzed by Arr (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Baysarowich et al., 2008</xref>), glycosylation on the hydroxyl group of C-23 by Rgt (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Spanogiannopoulos et al., 2012</xref>), phosphorylation on the hydroxyl group of C-21 by Rph (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Spanogiannopoulos et al., 2014</xref>), and Rif linearization (i.e., degradation) by Rox (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Koteva et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with the critical hydroxyl groups of C-21 and C-23 for Rif interactions with RpoB, the former three chemical group transfer modifications inevitably lead to its significantly low binding affinity. Altogether, these genetic elements constitute the Rif resistome, which negatively affects the expanded use of this class of antibiotics.</p><p>The recently characterized Rox enzymes belong to group A flavin monooxygenases, members of which have been widely distributed in the (poly)aromatic compound degradation and natural product biosynthesis (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Huijbers et al., 2014</xref>). The Rox gene sequence was first identified from a genomic library of <italic>Rhodococcus equi</italic> known to be responsible for Rif decolorization (i.e., degradation), thus conferring increased resistance to rifampicin (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 1997</xref>). Later, a Rox homolog was characterized from <italic>Nocardia farcinica</italic> to catalyze rifampicin 2&#x02019;-<italic>N</italic>-hydroxylation, which was then proposed to be responsible for the decolorization (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Hoshino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, however, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Koteva et al. (2018)</xref> characterized a Rox homolog from <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic> and revised that both the <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> Rox and <italic>N. farcinica</italic> Rox actually catalyze the C-2 hydroxylation and thereafter linearization of the Rif antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Indeed, this Rif-degrading mechanism is also consistent with the general function of group A flavin monooxygenases that hydroxylate phenolic compounds (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Huijbers et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our recent sequence analysis using the <italic>N. farcinica</italic> Rox sequence as query revealed that Rox homologs are conserved and widely distributed in environmental and pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Intriguingly, the Rif producers (e.g., <italic>A. mediterranei</italic>, <italic>Salinispora arenicola</italic>, and <italic>Micromonospora</italic> sp. TP-A0468) also encode Rox homologs, but their functions are not yet determined. In this study, we first demonstrate that the Rox proteins from the Rif producers have the enzymatic Rif SV-degrading activity, which indicates that these proteins possess the ability to confer increased self-resistance to Rif antibiotics. Next, we find that members of the Rox proteins have a slightly different substrate scope by assessing structurally diverse Rif compounds. Finally, we prove that Rox proteins can also catalyze the transformation of 16-demethylsalinisporamycin to 16-demethylsaliniketal A. 16-Demethylsaliniketal A is a shunt product of the 16-demethylrifamycin producer <italic>Micromonospora</italic> sp.

Therefore, our biochemical findings not only establish that the Rif producers encode the Rif-degrading monooxygenase for potential self-resistance, but also bridge the gap of saliniketal biosynthesis.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Characterization of the Rox homologs from Rif producers as well as other bacteria. <bold>(A)</bold> Sequence similarity network analysis of Rox homologs.

The intensive 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of the reaction products unambiguously demonstrated that the Rox proteins from both <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> (<italic>Sv</italic>Rox) and <italic>N. farcinica</italic> (<italic>Nf</italic>Rox) can catalyze the linearization of the Rif antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Their encoding gene sequences were obtained by either direct PCR amplifications or chemical synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). All five proteins were successfully expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The isolated proteins showed the yellow color characteristic of bound FAD (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). For the enzymatic assays, Rif SV was first used as a substrate to assess the monooxygenation function. Based on the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the reaction assays, we found that all our selected proteins had the ability to transform Rif SV to a new compound <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), while the boiled enzymes did not.

Therefore, this result suggests that <bold>1</bold> is likely to be the expected monooxygenation product of Rif SV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>To fully elucidate the structure of <bold>1</bold>, we performed large-scale enzymatic reactions so as to accumulate a sufficient amount for intensive NMR analyses. Based on the HMBC data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), we observed the expected correlation signals for the compound <bold>1</bold> that has an amino group at C-15 and a hydroxyl group at C-2: (1) the two proton signals (&#x003b4; = 7.09 and 7.26) correlate with C-15 and C-16, which suggests that they belong to the amino group at C-15; and (2) the proton signal (&#x003b4; = 15.15) correlates with C-2 and C-3, indicating a hydroxyl group at C-2. These two lines of evidence are fully consistent with the Rox-mediated linearization and lead us to conclude that the chemical structure of <bold>1</bold> is indeed the degradation product of Rif SV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).

Another self-resistance mechanism involves the Rif efflux pump RifP, which is regulated by a TetR-family transcriptional regulator RifQ (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2018</xref>). In this work, we uncovered a third self-resistance mechanism, that is, the Rox-catalyzed Rif degradation. Interestingly, however, the <italic>Am</italic>Rox gene is transcriptionally silent on the basis of the RNA-seq analysis from the previous report (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Shao et al., 2015</xref>), which indicates that this gene is a conditionally-activated self-resistance determinant.</p><p>Significantly, due to the substrate-promiscuous feature of Rox enzymes, we assigned the second missing saliniketal biosynthetic enzyme. As far as we know, this is the first case that an antibiotic-detoxifying enzyme is simultaneously a designated enzyme involved in another antibiotic biosynthesis. Therefore, saliniketal A is actually biosynthesized by two catalysis-promiscuous enzymes, including the cytochrome P450 (Sare1259 or its counterpart) encoded within the Rif biosynthetic gene cluster that is involved in the biosynthesis of both Rif and saliniketals, and the Rif-degrading monooxygenase Rox. Of the selected Rox proteins, we found that the <italic>Ss</italic>Rox protein from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. TP-A0356 is the most versatile and efficient catalyst with a broad substrate scope, which can be engineered for the generation of saliniketal analogs.</p><p>Of note, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Koteva et al. (2018)</xref> previously used rifabutin and Rif S as competitive inhibitors to assess the Rox-mediated rifampicin monooxygenation and found that the naphthoquinone forms of rifamycins can overcome the monooxygenation reaction. Based on the crystal structures of <italic>Sv</italic>Rox in complex with FAD (and rifampicin) they reasoned that the bulky substituent at position 3 of rifabutin sterically impedes productive binding; although Rif S completely blocked the enzymatic activity, they found it was not a substrate for the monooxygenation reaction (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Koteva et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, however, we showed that both 16-demethylrifamycin W and 16-demethylsalinisporamycin of the naphthoquinone form can be accepted by the Rox proteins. Initially, we thought that the two compounds were first spontaneously reduced by NADPH, and then the reduced forms acted as direct substrates. However, we found that the two compounds could not be reduced even under the conditions of a 100-fold excess of NADPH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S10a</xref>), which led us to investigate Rif S reduction by NADPH. Interestingly, Rif S was easily reduced by NADPH, and converted by <italic>Ss</italic>Rox to the compound <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S10b</xref>). Meanwhile, our time-course analysis of Rif SV degradation revealed that Rif S was produced during the air oxidation of Rif SV and then consumed in the assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S10c</xref>). Previous mechanisms of Rif degradation suggest that a C-1 phenolic hydroxyl group is required to trigger the monooxygenation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Koteva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, the deprotonation of the C-1 hydroxyl group is not initiated by a catalytic base from Rox but facilitated by the hydrogen bond network between the Rif C-1/C-8 hydroxyl groups and the N5 atom of the reduced FAD cofactor. Next, the resultant anion at C-2 attacks C4a-hydroperoxyflavin, generating the hydroxyl intermediate at C-2, followed by ring-opening to form the degradation product (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). However, for substrates of the naphthoquinone form, the C-2 carbon is actually electrophilic and might be directly attacked by the peroxyflavin to form (hydro)peroxyrifamycin, which is similar to but different from the Baeyer&#x02013;Villiger oxidation mechanism (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Huijbers et al., 2014</xref>). The decomposition of (hydro)peroxyrifamycin to the degradation product may be facilitated by the excessive NADPH. This latter mechanism is also consistent with one of the two hypotheses by <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. (2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Therefore, we believe both mechanisms might well explain the Rif degradation.</p><p>In summary, our findings not only demonstrate that the Rox proteins from the Rif producers function as a potential self-resistance determinant to degrade Rif antibiotics, but also complete the gap of the biosynthesis of saliniketal A.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S4.SS1"><title>General</title><p>Medium ingredients, biochemicals, and reagents were purchased from Oxoid Ltd (United Kingdom), Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (China), Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (United States), and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China), unless otherwise stated.
