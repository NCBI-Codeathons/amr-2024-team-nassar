Thus, we performed anaerobic digestion using dairy manure at three temperature levels (moderate: 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, mesophilic: 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and thermophilic: 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), to analyze the dynamics of ARGs and bacterial communities by quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that 8/10 detected ARGs declined and 5/10 decreased more than 1.0 log during thermophilic digestion, whereas only four and five ARGs decreased during moderate and mesophilic digestion, respectively. The changes in ARGs and bacterial communities were similar under the moderate and mesophilic treatments, but distinct from those in the thermophilic system. Potential pathogens such as Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> were removed by thermophilic digestion but not by moderate and mesophilic digestion. The bacterial community succession was the dominant mechanism that influenced the variation in ARGs and integrons during anaerobic digestion. Thermophilic digestion decreased the amount of mesophilic bacteria (Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria) carrying ARGs. Anaerobic digestion generally decreased the abundance of integrons by eliminating the aerobic hosts of integrons (Actinomycetales and Bacilli). Thermophilic anaerobic digestion is recommended for the treatment and reuse of animal manure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>As an emerging contaminant, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have become a great public health concern<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

Diverse results have been obtained in various studies of the effects of temperature on ARGs during anaerobic digestion.

A recent metagenomic analysis by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> detected no obvious differences in the total ARGs under thermophilic and mesophilic digestion. It should be noted that all of these studies were conducted using wastewater sludge, the effects of temperature on ARGs in animal manure were not studied. Due to the huge differences in physicochemical properties, antibiotic types and concentrations, and microbial community composition in wastewater sludge and animal manure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, it is highly likely that different effects on ARGs may be obtained by the anaerobic digestion of livestock manure. In addtion, the dynamics of ARGs during anaerobic digestion have received little study, and the underlying mechanism responsible for the variation in ARGs are not fully revealed.</p><p>Bacteria are the main carriers of ARGs and the changes in the bacterial community may lead to variations in the abundance of ARGs. Thus, we hypothesized that changes in the bacterial community comprise the main mechanism responsible for variation in ARGs during anaerobic digestion, where different temperatures will shape distinct bacterial communities with diverse effects on ARGs. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to compare the variation of ARGs in dairy manure under moderate (20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), mesophilic (35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), and thermophilic (55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) anaerobic digestion; and (2) to explore the relationships among the chemical properties, bacterial communities, and ARGs during anaerobic digestion. The results of this study may help to enhance the reduction of ARGs from animal manure by anaerobic digestion, thereby reducing the environmental risk due to ARGs.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental setup</title><p>The dairy manure used in this study was sampled from a medium-sized farm in Yangling, China.

The rarefaction curve shown that the rarefied sequencing depth (33054) can reveal most bacterial communities in all samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>). We found obvious changes in the bacterial communities in the initial digester (D0) and that obtained from the anaerobic digestion system on day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Three principal components (PCs) accounted for 50.2% of the total variance in bacterial community. In particular, the number of OTUs declined dramatically in the thermophilic treatment on day 3. The thermophilic treatment had the lowest OTU diversity and its bacterial community varied less with time compared with the moderate and mesophilic treatments. The bacterial communities were very similar on day 3 under the moderate and mesophilic treatments, but they started to differentiate from day 12. The trends in the bacterial community succession were similar under the moderate and mesophilic treatments, where the scores for PC1 and PC2 decreased gradually with the duration of digestion.</p><p>Firmicutes (41.0%) and Actinobacteria (44.2%) were dominant phyla in the initial digester (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The phylum Firmicutes was represented primarily by the classes Bacilli and Clostridia, where Bacilli declined from 28.3% on day 0 to 0.13&#x02013;0.43% on day 60, whereas Clostridia were enriched from 12.6% in the initial material to 22.5&#x02013;49.7% in the digestion product. Actinobacteria primarily comprised members of the order Actinomycetales (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S3</xref>), which declined dramatically to 0.06&#x02013;2.75% (day 60) from 44.2% (day 0) after digestion. By contrast, Bacteroidetes became dominant (41.3&#x02013;50.3%) in the moderate and mesophilic systems, which was not the case under the thermophilic treatment. The phylum Chloroflexi increased with the digestion temperature, whereas Proteobacteria exhibited the opposite trend. Chloroflexi increased rapidly from 0.35% on day 0 to 31.7% and 38.8% on day 60 under the mesophilic and thermophilic treatments, respectively, but only 1.5% under the moderate treatment. Thermotogae and Chloroflexi were dominant phyla in the thermophilic treatment, where they accounted for 76.1&#x02013;97.0% from day 12 to 60.

The bacterial community and selected environmental factors explained 75.6% of the total variance in the ARGs. Among the selected variables, six phyla explained the most variation, i.e., 60.4%, while temperature explained 16.9%, AN explained 14.5% and the other three factors only accounted for 8.2% of the total variance.

Significant reduction of <italic>sul1</italic> and <italic>sul2</italic> by mesophilic and thermophilic digestion was consistent to Ma <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and Miller <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.

The low RAs of most ARGs in the thermophilic reactor throughout digestion suggest that high temperature can reduce the ratio of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. For most of the ARGs and integrase genes, the changes in their RAs occurred mostly within 30 days. This is because the bacterial communities varied greatly for 30 days but they tended to stabilize in the later stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The similar changes in the ARGs under the moderate and mesophilic treatments may be explained by their similar bacterial communities during digestion. By contrast, higher temperature digestion (55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) led to remarkable differences in the bacterial community compared with those obtained at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, where different trends in <italic>tetC</italic>, <italic>tetM</italic>, and <italic>tetX</italic> were observed under the thermophilic, moderate, and mesophilic treatments. Integrons are often associated with mobile genetic elements such as transposons and plasmids, and they are recognized as important indicators of HGT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. It is considered that HGT may play important roles in anaerobic digestion process because high biomass densities may provide favorable conditions for HGT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. However, we found no significant correlation between ARGs (except <italic>sul2</italic>) and integrase genes, which may suggest that the integrons do not play a large role in potential HGT during anaerobic digestion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>Very high variations in the oxygen concentration and temperature were the main reasons for the changes in the bacterial communities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Most of the mesophilic bacteria were eliminated at 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and thus this treatment had the lowest bacterial diversity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The dramatic decline in Actinobacteria after digestion was attributable mainly to decreases in the order Actinomycetales (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S3</xref>), which are mostly aerobic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. The order Bacteroidales was dominant in the phylum Bacteroidetes and they are obligate anaerobes but not thermotolerant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, and thus they increased in the 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C treatments, whereas they were not found in the 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C treatment. Two classes of Firmicutes exhibited differences because Clostridia are anaerobic whereas Bacilli are obligate or facultative aerobes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Chloroflexi and Thermotogae are anaerobic thermophilic bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, and they were only found in the 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C treatments. It has been reported that Chloroflexi can use halogenated organics as energy sources<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and that Thermotogae can utilize different complex carbohydrates to produce hydrogen gas during anaerobic digestion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.</p><p>This study confirmed that changes in the bacterial communities are key drivers of changes in the variation of ARGs during anaerobic digestion. Similar results were obtained based on tests of aerobic composting and water chlorination processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Miller <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> also found that the ARG level of a digester was attributed to the survival or death of antibiotic resistant bacteria during anaerobic digestion. The variations in six phyla (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Thermotogae) were the main causes of the changes during anaerobic digestion and the differences at various temperatures. By contrast, the chemical characteristics of the digestion system were not correlated with the changes in ARGs. The results of the present study indicate that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes are important hosts of ARGs during anaerobic digestion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports that Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria can resist a wide variety of antibiotics, including tetracycline, &#x003b2;-lactams, aminoglycosides, and erythromycin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. The high temperature treatment effectively eliminated Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, thereby reducing <italic>tetM</italic>, <italic>tetQ</italic>, <italic>gyrA</italic>, and <italic>sul1</italic> with high efficiency. Similarly, the increase in Bacteroidetes was responsible for the increases of <italic>tetC</italic>, <italic>tetM</italic>, <italic>tetQ</italic>, <italic>tetX</italic>, and <italic>sul1</italic> under moderate and mesophilic temperatures during anaerobic digestion. In addition, the inhibition of HGT at high temperatures may also contribute to the lower RAs of ARGs in the thermophilic system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p><p>Anaerobic digestion can remove some pathogens from raw waste and thermophilic digestion is particularly effective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Several potentially opportunistic human pathogens such as Bacilli and Actinomycetales were removed by anaerobic digestion in this study. However, the abundance of Bacteroidetes, which includes some species that can cause infections of the peritoneal cavity, gastrointestinal surgery, and appendicitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, increased after moderate and mesophilic digestion. Actinomycetales and <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> are potential pathogens that can harbor <italic>sul</italic> and integrons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, where they comprised 29.1% of the total bacteria in the raw material, but they were removed by thermophilic digestion, whereas 0.26% and 0.17% remained under moderate and mesophilic digestion. Proteobacteria are also potentially pathogenic bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, which were removed by thermophilic digestion, but 5.5% and 1.7% remained after moderate and mesophilic digestion. These results suggest that the digestion products from moderate and mesophilic treatments are potential risks for agricultural application<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, in agreement with the results of most previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, integrase genes were significantly reduced at different temperatures, thereby demonstrating the universal reduction effect of anaerobic digestion on integrase genes. Proteobacteria, order Actinomycetales in Actinobacteria, and class Bacilli in Firmicutes were the main carriers of integrons in the present study. Actinomycetales were the main producer of antibiotics, and thus they were common hosts of ARGs and integrons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Proteobacteria and Bacilli have also been reported as common carriers of integrons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. The universal reduction of integrons by anaerobic digestion can be explained by the significant reduction of aerobic bacteria such as Actinomycetales and Bacilli after anaerobic digestion of the raw material.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that bacterial community succession was the main mechanism that affected the variation in ARGs and integrase genes. Thermophilic anaerobic digestion reduced the abundance of mesophilic bacteria carrying ARGs and its ARG reduction was better than that of the moderate and mesophilic treatments. Anaerobic digestion universally reduced the abundance of integrase genes because it removed significant amounts of the aerobic hosts of integrons. Thermophilic digestion also has advantages in terms of methane production as well as speed and stability compared with moderate and mesophilic digestion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The consumption of more energy to maintain a high temperature is the main disadvantage of thermophilic anaerobic digestion. However, given the reduction of ARGs, integrase genes, and pathogenic bacteria, as well as methane production, thermophilic anaerobic digestion is highly recommended for the treatment and reuse of animal manure.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Sun, W. <italic>et al</italic>.
