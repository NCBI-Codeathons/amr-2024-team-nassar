While bulky DNA lesions the size of those produced by YTM are normally removed from the genome by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, YTM adducts are also a substrate for the bacterial DNA glycosylases AlkD and YtkR2, unexpectedly implicating base excision repair (BER) in their elimination. The reason for the extreme toxicity of these lesions and the molecular basis for how they are eliminated by BER have been unclear. Here, we describe the structural and biochemical properties of YTM adducts responsible for their toxicity, and define the mechanism by which they are excised by AlkD. These findings delineate an alternative strategy for repair of bulky DNA damage and establish the cellular utility of this pathway relative to that of NER.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">A large number of environmental toxins, chemotherapeutic drugs, and cellular metabolites, including those used by microbes as defense mechanisms, are alkylating agents that generate a chemically diverse spectrum of modifications on both the phosphodeoxyribose backbone and the nucleobases of DNA<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. These lesions are both mutagenic and cytotoxic as a result of their ability to mistemplate or block nucleotide incorporation during transcription and replication. The majority of alkylation damage is eliminated from the genome by two excision repair pathways. Bulky and/or helix-distorting lesions are removed through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In prokaryotes, NER is initiated by the UvrABC incision complex, which isolates the damage within a 12-nucleotide segment that is subsequently replaced with undamaged DNA by helicase, polymerase, and ligase activities. Conversely, small nucleobase modifications are removed by the base excision repair (BER) pathway<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, which is initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases that hydrolyze the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond linking the damaged nucleobase to the backbone. The resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site is processed by endonuclease, exonuclease, polymerase, and ligase activities. Unlike the UvrABC complex, which acts on a broad spectrum of bulky lesions, DNA glycosylases are each specific for a limited number of small lesions<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The size of the lesions repaired by BER is limited by the DNA glycosylases that initiate the pathway. These enzymes typically employ a base-flipping mechanism to extrude the modified nucleobase from the DNA duplex in order to capture it inside a nucleobase binding pocket on the surface of the protein<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. This binding pocket allows for damage recognition through shape and charge complementary with the modified nucleobase, while also providing a scaffold for residues that catalyze hydrolysis of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond. Importantly, the nucleobase binding pocket also imposes a steric limit on the size of the lesions that can be excised by DNA glycosylases.</p><p id="P4">We recently discovered that the DNA glycosylase AlkD from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> excises cationic <italic>N</italic>3- and <italic>N</italic>7-alkylpurine lesions exclusively through contacts with the phosphodeoxyribose backbone, while leaving the modified nucleobase stacked in the duplex<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. This unique mechanism eliminates the steric constraints of a nucleobase binding pocket and allows AlkD to excise bulky alkylpurine adducts that are refractory to removal by base-flipping DNA glycosylases<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we showed that this ability extends to adducts produced by yatakemycin (YTM), a 680-Da alkylating agent belonging to the spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone family of natural products, which includes CC-1065, duocarmycin A, and duocarmycin SA<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This discovery suggested that excision of 3-yatakemycinyl-2&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine (YTMA) lesions is a general feature of DNA glycosylases in the AlkD family, contradicting the original report that YtkR2, an ortholog of AlkD (26% identity and 48% similarity) from the YTM-producer <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. TP-A0356, had uniquely evolved to provide self-resistance to YTM<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">YTM, CC-1065, and the duocarmycins are extraordinarily potent antimicrobial and antitumor drugs<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. These bulky alkylating agents preferentially bind in the deeper, narrower minor groove of AT-rich regions of DNA and undergo DNA binding-induced activation of the spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone moiety to form covalent adducts at <italic>N</italic>3 of adenine<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The resultant lesions provide a striking degree of stabilization to the DNA duplex, and have been shown to severely hinder transcription and replication<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, the stability that these bulky adducts impart has been postulated to account for the ineffectiveness with which they are removed by the NER pathway<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. However, the cause of this increased duplex stability has not been convincingly explained.</p><p id="P6">We now provide a molecular basis for the efficacy of YTM and related drugs through an examination of the YTMA lesion and its thermodynamic and structural effects on DNA, as well as its recognition and repair by AlkD. YTM adducts impart a remarkable stabilization to the DNA duplex through a network of CH/&#x003c0; interactions between the YTM moiety and the deoxyribose groups of the surrounding nucleotides. This stabilization is likely responsible for both the slow spontaneous depurination of YTMA lesions and the apparent difficulty with which these lesions are repaired by the NER pathway. Remodeling of YTMA-DNA by AlkD, however, disrupts the CH/&#x003c0; interactions involving the modified strand and provides a water nucleophile access to the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond. The catalytic power of AlkD is underscored by rapid excision of YTMA lesions under single-turnover conditions and substantial retention of enzyme activity for a substrate analog that abrogates the activity of other DNA glycosylases. Surprisingly, the combined activities of AlkD-mediated BER and NER provide only weak protection against YTM toxicity in cells. We attribute this low level of resistance to the extreme stability of the YTMA-DNA substrate and a deleterious persistence of the AlkD/AP-DNA product complex. We discuss structural differences between YtkR2 and AlkD that would alleviate product inhibition by YtkR2, providing the producing strain with effective self-resistance against YTM toxicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>BER and NER provide limited resistance to YTM</title><p id="P7">We previously showed that AlkD provides <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> cells with a small degree of protection from YTM toxicity<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Because NER has been shown to provide resistance to CC-1065 and analogs of the duocarmycins<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, we wanted to compare the relative efficiencies of AlkD-mediated BER and UvrA-mediated NER in YTM resistance. Using a series of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> deletion strains that lacked either <italic>alkD</italic>, <italic>uvrA</italic>, or both, we monitored growth in the presence of increasing concentrations of YTM. In the absence of YTM, none of the deletion strains displayed a growth defect (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). However, in the presence of YTM, all deletion strains exhibited varying degrees of increased sensitivity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The &#x00394;<italic>uvrA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>alkD</italic> strain was the most sensitive, and showed a pronounced growth defect at 2 nM YTM, a concentration at which the other deletion strains showed normal growth. At 5&#x02013;9 nM YTM, growth of the &#x00394;<italic>uvrA</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>alkD</italic> strains was inhibited beyond that of the wild-type strain, with &#x00394;<italic>uvrA</italic> cells showing greater sensitivity than &#x00394;<italic>alkD</italic> cells. Strikingly, all strains, including wild-type <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, were markedly inhibited at 20 nM YTM. These results indicate that NER and AlkD-mediated BER provide similarly weak levels of protection against YTM toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>YTMA lesions dramatically stabilize duplex DNA</title><p id="P8">To understand the molecular basis for the extreme toxicity of YTM and the resistance of YTMA lesions to repair by both BER and NER in cells, we characterized yatakemycinylated DNA using a combination of crystallographic and biophysical methods. The circular dichroism spectrum of YTMA-DNA showed negative and positive bands at ~240 and 280 nm, respectively, characteristic of B-form DNA<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The two additional bands present above 300 nm in the spectrum of YTMA-DNA are likely caused by dichroism of the YTM moiety itself, which produces a broad peak centered at ~360 nm in the YTMA-DNA absorbance spectrum (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the spectral differences between yatakemycinylated and unmodified DNA, at least in part, reflect structural changes in the DNA induced by the YTMA lesion. Efforts to determine the structure of YTMA-DNA by X-ray crystallography generated crystals that produced smeared reflections, indicative of the partial lateral and angular disorder present in fibers (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). The fiber diffraction pattern from YTMA-DNA is unmistakably representative of B-form DNA, which can be identified by a repeating diamond pattern and layer lines that form a distinct central cross (lines 1&#x02013;3 and 5) and intense meridian arcs (line 10)<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Thus, the circular dichroism spectrum and the fiber diffraction pattern of YTMA-DNA are both consistent with a B-DNA structure.</p><p id="P9">Based on our crystallographic and biophysical data, we constructed a model of YTMA-DNA by manually docking the YTM moiety of yatakemycinyladenine (YTMAde) nucleobase from a crystallographic AlkD/AP-DNA product complex (described below) into ideal B-form DNA (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d&#x02013;f</xref>). Despite the lesion and the DNA being maintained as rigid bodies, the conformation of the YTM moiety seemed to be well suited to fit into the minor groove, leaving only the hydrophilic edge exposed to solvent. In this predominantly buried arrangement, the &#x003c0;-faces of all three YTM subunits form an extensive network of CH/&#x003c0; interactions with deoxyribose groups in both DNA strands (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Individually, CH/&#x003c0; interactions are often fairly weak (~1 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. However, the combined strength of the 24 CH/&#x003c0; interactions present in our YTMA-DNA model would create a significant energetic barrier to base-pair opening or thermal denaturation. Consistent with this prediction, we found that a single YTMA lesion in a GC-rich dodecamer increased the melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) of the duplex by 36&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Our YTMA-DNA model also predicts that without the unlikely dissociation of YTMAde, C1&#x02032; will be sterically occluded from nucleophilic attack by a water molecule, rendering YTMA resistant to hydrolysis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Indeed, we found that at 25&#x000b0;C the spontaneous rate of YTMA depurination [<italic>k</italic><sub>non</sub> = (1.8 &#x000b1; 0.1) &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>] (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Results</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) is 61-fold slower than that of 3-methyl-2&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine (3mA) [<italic>k</italic><sub>non</sub> = 1.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>] (interpolated from published rates at 22 and 39&#x000b0;C)<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. This difference corresponds to a half-life of 1.1 weeks for 3mA versus 1.2 years for YTMA. Taken together, these data suggest that YTMA lesions substantially increase the energetic barrier to duplex denaturation and YTMA depurination by preventing separation of the DNA strands surrounding the adduct. Moreover, previous characterization of DNA modified by CC-1065 and the duocarmycins<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> suggests these properties may extend to lesions produced by all members of this family of natural products.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AlkD excises YTMA lesions by prying open the minor groove</title><p id="P10">We previously showed that AlkD is capable of excising YTMA lesions in vitro<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. In order to assess the enzymatic rate enhancement and the relative activity of AlkD for YTMA versus other cationic alkylpurine lesions, we measured the rate of YTMA excision under single-turnover conditions. With a 50-fold molar excess of enzyme to DNA, both AlkD and YtkR2 converted all substrate to product within 30 s (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), the first time point in the assay, corresponding to the maximum measureable rate of excision under these conditions. As such, the catalytic rate constant determined for excision of YTMA [<italic>k</italic><sub>st</sub> = (1.6 &#x000b1; 0.1) &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>] is a lower limit. Despite being underestimated, this rate equates to a 10<sup>7</sup>-fold enhancement over the rate of non-enzymatic YTMA depurination under the same conditions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). By contrast, the rate of excision of 7-methyl-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine (7mG) [<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> = 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>] by AlkD corresponds to a rate enhancement of only 10<sup>4</sup>-fold<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">To ascertain the structural basis for the preferential and apparently facile excision of YTMA lesions by AlkD, we determined a crystal structure of AlkD in the presence of YTMA-DNA. X-ray diffraction data extending to 1.6 &#x000c5; revealed a ternary AlkD/AP-DNA/YTMAde product complex in which the glycosidic bond of YTMA had been cleaved (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c,d</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Overall, the structure is remarkably similar to those of previously determined product complexes containing much smaller 3-methyladenine (3mAde) and 3-deaza-3-methyladenine (3d3mAde) nucleobases<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4</xref>). In all structures, a common set of DNA binding residues remodels the duplex, bending the helical axis by ~30&#x000b0; away from the protein and widening the minor groove by 4&#x02013;5 &#x000c5; around the lesion (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e&#x02013;h</xref>). In stark contrast to the products of base-flipping DNA glycosylases<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, the excised nucleobases in these complexes are stacked between flanking nucleotides and paired with an opposing thymidine. In the complex containing YTMAde, the YTM moiety is bound in a cleft that follows the minor groove. Contacts between AlkD and this bulky group significantly extend the protein&#x02013;ligand binding interface, providing an additional 43% of buried surface area compared to the complex containing 3d3mAde (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, the only hydrogen bonds between AlkD and YTMAde are provided by Gln38 and Lys156, which contact the four hydroxyl and methoxy substituents on the left and right subunits (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>). All other hydrogen bonds with YTMAde are mediated by water (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The most prominent binding contacts with the YTMAde nucleobase occur through CH/&#x003c0; interactions provided by Tyr27, Trp109, and Trp187 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>). Together, these residues form an aromatic shelf below the YTM group, with Tyr27 acting as a CH/&#x003c0; acceptor for the pyrrolidine moiety in the left subunit, and Trp109 and Trp187 serving as CH/&#x003c0; donors for the indole moieties in the middle and right subunits.</p><p id="P12">DNA remodeling of this kind by DNA glycosylases is generally associated with inducing strain that allows for detection of DNA damage and reducing the energetic barrier to base-pair opening, which facilitates base flipping<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. DNA remodeling by AlkD, however, likely plays a different, or additional, role. By asymmetrically widening the minor groove around the YTMAde nucleobase, AlkD leaves intact all CH/&#x003c0; interactions between the YTM moiety and the unmodified strand, while prying apart the YTM moiety and the modified strand (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g,h</xref>). This separation allows Trp109, Asp113, and Trp187 to form the same contacts with the AP site in the complex containing YTMAde as in the complex containing 3d3mAde (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4</xref>). In both structures, Asp113 forms a hydrogen-bonding interaction with O1&#x02032;, while Trp109 and Trp187 form CH/&#x003c0; interactions with C2&#x02032;, C4&#x02032;, and C5&#x02032; (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>). For methylpurine lesions, these residues have been shown to catalyze excision by stabilizing the development of positive charge on the deoxyribose ring in the transition state<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Asp113 has also been proposed to catalyze excision by positioning and deprotonating the nucleophilic water.</p><p id="P13">We mutated the three putative catalytic residues that contact the AP site, as well as three residues that contact the YTMAde nucleobase, to assess the role that each plays in YTMA excision. As noted above, the rate of excision measured for wild-type AlkD is a lower limit. The same maximum measurable rate was observed with the AlkD-Y27A, -Q38A, and -K156A mutants, masking any possible differences above this threshold (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). However, the AlkD-W109A, -D113A, and -W187A mutants were substantially impaired, exhibiting at least 76-fold, 760-fold, and 25-fold reductions, respectively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These reduced rates were not significantly altered by increasing the concentration of the enzymes [<italic>k</italic><sub>st,W109A</sub> = (2.4 &#x000b1; 0.4) &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <italic>k</italic><sub>st,D113A</sub> = (1.9 &#x000b1; 0.1) &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>st,W187A</sub> = (7.2 &#x000b1; 2.0) &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>] (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), indicating the mutants were present at a saturating concentration but have a diminished ability to stabilize the cationic transition state. These rates are nonetheless at least 10<sup>4</sup>-fold greater than the rate of spontaneous depurination (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Such high residual activity is consistent with the redundant roles of Trp109, Asp113, and Trp187 in stabilizing the development of positive charge on the deoxyribose ring, but may also be indicative of the importance of widening the minor groove around the YTMA lesion. Even with diminished stabilization of the transition state, eliminating the steric hindrance that prevents a water nucleophile from accessing the glycosidic bond may significantly enhance the rate of hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Fluorinated YTMA is not refractory to excision by AlkD</title><p id="P14">The high excision activity retained by the AlkD mutants hindered our efforts to crystallize an AlkD/YTMA-DNA substrate complex.

Under the single-turnover conditions used with the non-fluorinated YTMA-DNA substrate, AlkD fully removed YTMA<sub>F</sub> in less than 10 min [<italic>k</italic><sub>st</sub> = (2.4 &#x000b1; 0.1) &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>] (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). To our knowledge, only uracil DNA glycosylase has been observed to excise a fluorinated lesion <sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, albeit at a rate 10<sup>3</sup>-fold slower than that catalyzed by AlkD. The addition of electron-withdrawing substituents to C2&#x02032; increases the activation barrier to depurination by destabilizing the cationic transition state<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Seemingly, this heightened barrier is insurmountable for most DNA glycosylases that use a traditional base-flipping mechanism and rely upon a single catalytic residue to stabilize the development of positive charge on the deoxyribose ring. Conversely, the non-base-flipping mechanism employed by AlkD allows for charge stabilization by three residues&#x02014;Trp109, Asp113, and Trp187&#x02014;which seem to provide sufficient electron donation to largely offset the effects of electron withdrawal by the 2&#x02032;-fluoro group.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Persistence of the product complex impedes repair</title><p id="P16">The proficiency with which AlkD excised YTMA and YTMA<sub>F</sub> lesions in vitro seemed at odds with the weak protection that AlkD provided to cells challenged with YTM. We examined two possible explanations for this paradox. First, we determined if AlkD could efficiently excise YTMA lesions under multiple-turnover conditions, which may be more relevant to repair in vivo. With 0.1 molar equivalents of AlkD, the first enzymatic turnover of YTMA-DNA was complete within 30 s (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). However, subsequent turnovers required far more time, and the time required for each successive turnover progressively increased as the fraction product increased. Both observations are consistent with product inhibition. Moreover, the addition of Exonuclease III (ExoIII) and Endonuclease IV (EndoIV), the two bacterial AP endonucleases that perform the next step in the BER pathway<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), only modestly increased the rate of YTMA excision (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Second, we ascertained if ExoIII and EndoIV could readily incise DNA at AP sites produced from YTMA, or if AlkD and/or YTMAde nucleobase would hinder incision. Using AP-DNA and YTMAde generated with 0.1 and 1 molar equivalents of AlkD, we observed two rates of incision in each reaction (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c,d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We attributed the first, faster rate to incision of unbound DNA, and the second, much slower rate to incision of DNA bound by AlkD. For each AP endonuclease, the first rates of incision were similar at both concentrations of AlkD, as were the second rates (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). However, the fraction product formed at each rate differed substantially, presumably as a function of the proportion of unbound to bound AP-DNA (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). To determine if inhibition of AP endonuclease activity resulted from the presence of AlkD, YTMAde, or both, we repeated the incision assays with 0.1 molar equivalents of AlkD but replaced YTMAde and AP-DNA with 3mAde and tetrahydrofuran (THF)-DNA. Again, we observed two rates, both of which were comparable to the rates of incision of AP-DNA with YTMAde (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c,d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Together, these data indicate that AlkD tightly and preferentially binds abasic sites, either with or without YTMAde. This is consistent with our current and previous crystal structures of AlkD bound to abasic DNA<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, and with our previous biochemical data showing that AlkD binds THF-DNA with 10<sup>4</sup>-fold higher affinity [<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.5 nM] than unmodified DNA<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Tight, preferential binding of AP sites by AlkD would inhibit both multiple turnover of YTMA lesions and further repair by the BER pathway, explaining the weak level of protection that AlkD provides against YTM toxicity in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P17">This work delineates the molecular basis for an alternative repair pathway for YTMA lesions. The adducts formed by YTM, CC-1065, and the duocarmycins are too large to be excised by traditional DNA glycosylases and too stabilizing to the DNA duplex to be efficiently recognized by the UvrABC complex. Consequently, these compounds have extraordinarily high levels of toxicity, not unlike those of bifunctional alkylating agents that produce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Given the dramatic increase in duplex stability provided by YTMA and related lesions, owing to the extensive network of CH/&#x003c0; interactions that they form between opposing DNA strands, these lesions should arguably be regarded as non-covalent ICLs. In prokaryotes, ICLs are repaired through the combined activities of NER and either homologous recombination or translesion synthesis<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Since the adducts generated by YTM, CC-1065, and the duocarmycins neither destabilize nor significantly distort DNA<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, reliance on the UvrABC incision complex will likely hinder ICL repair in the same manner that it hinders NER. As such, none of the traditional repair pathways are well suited for these bulky and highly duplex-stabilizing lesions.</p><p id="P18">YtkR2 presumably evolved to eliminate this repair deficiency in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. TP-A0356 by specifically excising YTMA lesions, and thereby providing self-resistance to YTM. While orthologs of YtkR2, including AlkD, are prevalent in non-YTM producing bacteria<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, they likely have not undergone the same selective pressure. Despite YtkR2 and AlkD sharing thirteen of sixteen DNA binding residues, they share only four of twelve YTMAde binding residues (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Notably, these differences seem to create a larger binding cleft in YtkR2, with fewer contacts with YTMAde. While initially surprising, this may serve to destabilize the ternary product complex and promote dissociation of YtkR2, thereby avoiding the inhibition of AP endonuclease activity observed with AlkD. There is also the possibility that YtkR2 functions within a more specialized BER pathway. The gene cluster that encodes YtkR2 and the enzymes necessary for biosynthesis of YTM also encodes proteins with low sequence similarity to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> EndoIV and TatD, the latter of which is a 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease specific for single-stranded DNA<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>.

Seemingly the only strict requirement is that the substrate be positively charged, and therefore activated for excision<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. There are no protein contacts in the major groove, which could possibly block repair of major groove adducts, and the contacts in the minor groove seem to be largely non-specific. Only two residues&#x02014;Gln38 and Lys156&#x02014;form hydrogen-bonding interactions with YTMAde (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>), and the most prominent binding contacts, the CH/&#x003c0; interactions formed by Tyr27, Trp109, and Trp187, select only for aromatic groups. Furthermore, since most interactions with the hydrophilic edge of YTMAde are mediated by water (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), the partially solvent-filled cavity in which the YTM moiety is bound would be able to accommodate a variety of chemically and structurally diverse adducts. Taken together, these characteristics suggest that AlkD is capable of removing a broad spectrum of bulky lesions, both within and outside the spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone family.</p><p id="P20">Extension of the BER pathway beyond repair of small modifications is not limited to orthologs of AlkD. Two unrelated DNA glycosylases capable of unhooking covalent ICLs have been identified recently in bacteria and vertebrates<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Similar to <italic>ytkR2</italic>, the <italic>Streptomyces sahachiroi azi36/orf1</italic> gene provides self-resistance to the natural product azinomycin B, a potent bifunctional alkylating agent, by encoding a DNA glycosylase specific for azinomycin B-derived ICLs. While the cellular utility of BER-mediated removal of bulky and crosslinked adducts remains to be fully elucidated, these studies show that the spectrum of lesions eliminated from the genome by BER is primarily dependent on the DNA glycosylases that initiate the pathway. Moreover, the continued identification of novel DNA glycosylases with non-traditional substrates is likely to further expand the known role of BER in genomic maintenance, including providing self-resistance to genotoxic natural products.</p></sec><sec id="S9" specific-use="web-only"><title>ONLINE METHODS</title><sec id="S10"><title>Protein purification</title><p id="P21"><italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp.
