Understanding colibactin&#x02019;s biological effects remains difficult owing to the instability of the proposed active species and the complexity of the gut microbiota. Here, we report small molecule boronic acid inhibitors of colibactin biosynthesis. Designed to mimic the biosynthetic precursor precolibactin, these compounds potently inhibit the colibactin-activating peptidase ClbP. Using biochemical assays and crystallography, we show that they engage the ClbP binding pocket, forming a covalent bond with the catalytic serine. These inhibitors reproduce the phenotypes observed in a <italic>clbP</italic> deletion mutant and block the genotoxic effects of colibactin on eukaryotic cells. The availability of ClbP inhibitors will allow precise, temporal control over colibactin production, enabling further study of its contributions to CRC. Finally, application of our inhibitors to related peptidase-encoding pathways highlights the power of chemical tools to probe natural product biosynthesis.</p><p id="Par2">

In particular, several members of this community are proposed to play roles in the development of CRC, potentially through the production of small-molecule natural products or protein toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Despite the identification and association of possible microbial culprits with CRC, we still have limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the contributions of these organisms to carcinogenesis because of the inherent challenges of studying a complex and dynamic microbial community.</p><p id="Par5">These challenges are exemplified by recent efforts to characterize the genotoxic gut bacterial natural product colibactin. Colibactin is produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#x02013;polyketide synthase assembly line encoded by the <italic>pks</italic> genomic island, which is carried by many strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Although it was initially observed over a decade ago that <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic> elicit a genotoxic phenotype and cause DNA double-strand breaks in cultured epithelial cells, the chemical species responsible for these effects could not be readily identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Based on extensive metabolomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, characterization of biosynthetic enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and total synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, potential structures of colibactin have been proposed, although it has not been isolated from a natural source. The proposed structure that is most consistent with colibactin&#x02019;s DNA alkylating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and crosslinking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> activity contains two highly electrophilic cyclopropane warheads linked by a 1,2-diketone; the sensitivity of this linkage to oxidative C&#x02013;C bond cleavage may explain the difficulty of isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Formation of the warheads is accomplished in the final step of biosynthesis by the periplasmic peptidase ClbP, which hydrolyzes two units of the <italic>N</italic>-myristoyl-<sc>d</sc>-asparagine &#x02018;prodrug scaffold&#x02019; from a larger pseudodimeric precursor, precolibactin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This reaction releases the active species, colibactin, which alkylates two adenine residues on opposite strands of the target cell&#x02019;s DNA, resulting in highly toxic and mutagenic DNA interstrand crosslinks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These crosslinks can break down into monoadducts that are detectable in genomic DNA extracted from cultured cells and epithelial tissue of mice infected with <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Multiple lines of evidence suggest colibactin-mediated DNA damage plays a role in CRC development. Studies have reported that <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic> are found more frequently in CRC patients relative to healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, colonization with <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic> increased tumor loads in multiple mouse models of colitis-associated CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Multiple studies have reported colibactin-dependent mutational signatures in colonic epithelial cell-derived organoid models, cell lines and in sequenced human cancer genomes. These signatures show a strand bias consistent with interstrand crosslink formation and suggest that colibactin could directly cause CRC driver mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In cell line models, even short-term exposure to <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic> in culture can cause mutations that lead to changes in growth factor dependence and differentiation in murine colon cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, colibactin-dependent mutational signatures were also found in biopsies of morphologically normal colon crypts and were shown to accumulate primarily before the individual reached 10 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, although colibactin is strongly correlated with CRC, the timing and duration of the colibactin insult is likely an important variable in determining CRC risk and is still poorly understood.</p><p id="Par7">Although studies have illuminated a great deal about colibactin&#x02019;s carcinogenic potential, they also underscore that this natural product and its biosynthetic enzymes are part of a complex network of interactions that cannot be untangled with current tools. Deletion of any of the biosynthetically essential <italic>pks</italic> island genes abolishes production of colibactin, although different deletion mutants in the same strain background result in different phenotypes in vivo, suggesting other roles for these enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Genes in the <italic>pks</italic> island have also been linked to a number of seemingly disparate functions including siderophore biosynthesis and microcin production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Because the genotoxic effects of colibactin are cell-contact and inflammation dependent, it is challenging to distinguish its effects from other changes in the gut microbiota and host metabolism that occur during periods of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic> may also reshape the gut community directly by selectively inhibiting the growth of certain pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, forming interspecies biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and inducing prophages in other bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Investigating these questions requires examining colibactin&#x02019;s effects in the context of a complex gut community, which is difficult to accomplish with genetic tools. Whole-gene deletions may alter other pathways in which the gene product plays a structural role, and there is evidence that ClbP performs additional, noncatalytic functions in other biosynthetic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Genetic knockouts cannot offer temporal control, making it impossible to probe the importance of timing in colibactin exposure. Controlling exposure using direct addition of colibactin is currently impossible due to its instability and unresolved identity. A tool compound that specifically inhibits colibactin production would shed light on these questions by enabling studies of colibactin in complex <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> communities with greater precision than is currently possible.</p><p id="Par9">To address this need, we designed and characterized a series of boronic acid-based inhibitors of colibactin biosynthesis. These inhibitors directly engage the colibactin-activating peptidase ClbP and show a high degree of selectivity over unrelated human and bacterial hydrolases. We show that inhibition of ClbP using these compounds abrogates colibactin production in <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> communities. We confirm that these inhibitors completely block the genotoxic effects of colibactin on mammalian cells in culture. Finally, we show that these compounds can also inhibit closely related peptidases found in biosynthetic pathways from soil bacteria, illustrating that this strategy can be generalized to discover biosynthetic intermediates and study the biological roles of other recalcitrant natural products from genetically intractable organisms. By establishing precise control over natural product production, these inhibitors present a unique opportunity to study the effects of colibactin and other natural products in complex microbial communities and explore whether blocking colibactin production could be a viable therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and in vitro testing of putative ClbP inhibitors</title><p id="Par10">To design a specific inhibitor of colibactin biosynthesis, we targeted the colibactin-activating enzyme ClbP. This membrane-embedded periplasmic serine peptidase is essential for the genotoxicity of <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic>. Genetic deletion of ClbP results in an accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates and shunt metabolites from the nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#x02013;polyketide synthase assembly line, termed &#x02018;candidate precolibactins,&#x02019; many of which have been structurally characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This enzyme is an attractive target for inhibition as it belongs to the same enzyme family as &#x003b2;-lactamases like AmpC, which have been successfully targeted with small molecule inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. However, ClbP is not inhibited by several known &#x003b2;-lactamase inhibitors or broad-spectrum serine hydrolase inhibitors in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Although one study identified a pair of boronic acid-based ClbP inhibitors using in silico screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, we found that these compounds have minimal impact on ClbP&#x02019;s catalytic activity in vitro or in bacterial culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, there are currently no potent and/or selective inhibitors of this enzyme available.</p><p id="Par11">ClbP contains a catalytic triad typical of the S12 family of serine peptidases formed by the essential residues S95, K98 and Y186 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>). We aimed to target S95 by exploiting ClbP&#x02019;s essential and unusual acyl-<sc>d</sc>-Asn substrate-recognition motif (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Boron-based electrophiles have frequently been employed in inhibitors of serine and threonine peptidases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, but posed a synthetic challenge here because of the proximity of the potentially nucleophilic asparagine side chain. We ultimately accessed a small panel of pinacol boronate esters: MRV03-037 (<bold>1</bold>), MRV03-068 (<bold>2</bold>), MRV03-069 (<bold>3</bold>) and MRV03-070 (<bold>4</bold>), which are precursors of the corresponding boronic acids, using an enantioselective copper-catalyzed hydroboration reaction of an ester intermediate followed by ammonolysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Activity of ClbP guides rational design of colibactin biosynthesis inhibitors.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, ClbP activates colibactin by removing an <italic>N</italic>-myristoyl-<sc>d</sc>-Asn prodrug scaffold (red).

Because these compounds were designed to inhibit ClbP by forming a covalent bond with the critical active site serine residue, we examined the kinetics of inhibition using this assay.

This boronate complex is a structural analog of the tetrahedral intermediates formed during amide bond hydrolysis and participates in several stabilizing interactions that are likely relevant to the activation of precolibactin.

There are currently four known members of the edeine family (A, B, D and F), each of which has two naturally occurring structural isomers (1 or 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Focusing on edeine A, treatment with <bold>3</bold> resulted in accumulation of a mass consistent with a larger premetabolite incorporating the <italic>N</italic>-myristoyl-<sc>d</sc>-asparagine motif (observed 1155.5952, theoretical 1155.5940 [M+2K-H] <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).

Past observations that ClbP recognizes a structural motif not commonly found in other metabolites made it well-suited for substrate-guided inhibitor design. Notably, none of the inhibitors tested here show substantial differences in activity in vitro, despite bearing different <italic>N</italic>-acyl structures. This may indicate that the acyl group serves only a weak role in initial substrate recognition, while potency is driven by the reversible covalent bond formed between ClbP&#x02019;s catalytic serine residue and the boronic acid electrophile. Distinguishing which features are essential for potency and recognition will aid future medicinal chemistry efforts, as well as the design of other chemical tools with additional chemical functionality in the acyl group of the molecule.</p><p id="Par27">In addition to their high potency for ClbP inhibition, these compounds do not appear to interact with any of the other serine hydrolases examined in our assays. A potential risk of using electrophilic inhibitors is that their high potency and slow off-rates will lead to inhibition of many cellular targets. We surveyed a broad range of potential secondary targets, including PBPs in the same &#x003b2;-lactamase family as ClbP, using ABPP assays and did not observe evidence of off-target activity. Metabolomics experiments illustrate that treatment with these compounds does not broadly change metabolism outside of the colibactin biosynthetic pathway. Examining additional aspects of inhibitor selectivity would be aided by the preparation of chemical tools based on <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> which can form irreversible covalent bonds with ClbP and other potential targets. However, the fact that these compounds show limited toxicity to various organisms, including bacteria and mammalian cells, and minimal metabolic perturbation outside of the colibactin pathway are strong evidence that their off-target effects are low.</p><p id="Par28">One of the most promising aspects of these inhibitors is the opportunity they provide to study colibactin&#x02019;s effects in the context of a complex <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> community. We show that <bold>3</bold> can selectively block colibactin biosynthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic> NC101 in the presence of a complex gut community without antibiotic activity toward representatives of major gut bacterial phyla. These experiments also showed that baseline production of the prodrug scaffold is more than tenfold lower when <italic>pks</italic><sup>+</sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic> are present in low abundance in a community setting versus in monoculture. This dramatic difference is a reminder that studies in which germ-free mice are monocolonized with <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> bacteria cannot offer a complete picture of colibactin&#x02019;s impacts in a community context. Small molecule tools like <bold>3</bold> will enable studies to determine whether observations from monocolonization studies can be reproduced in conventional hosts with <italic>pks</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> communities.</p><p id="Par29">Finally, we confirmed that, in addition to blocking the formation of key metabolites like the prodrug scaffold, <bold>3</bold> can also prevent the genotoxic effects of colibactin on human cells. Treatment with <bold>3</bold> prevents cell-cycle arrest, DNA adduct formation and FANCD2 ubiquitination, biomarkers widely used to monitor colibactin&#x02019;s genotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A major challenge to studying colibactin has been the inability to establish precise control over colibactin exposure, limiting our ability to establish clear, causal connections between this unique toxin and the changes in the host which have been attributed to its activity. Our inhibitors can address this problem and allow us to dissect colibactin&#x02019;s role in cancer with a new level of detail.</p><p id="Par30">These chemical tools can also be applied beyond the context of colibactin and the gut microbiota. The family of prodrug-activating peptidases related to ClbP is highly selective in substrate scope and widely distributed in biosynthetic gene clusters from environmental bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. We showed that our inhibitors can selectively disrupt production of both zwittermicin and the edeines. These experiments allowed us to uncover the biosynthetic intermediate &#x02018;prezwittermicin&#x02019;, which had only been predicted based on the biosynthetic gene cluster. Moreover, we provide the first experimental observation, to our knowledge, of preedeine metabolites, directly demonstrating how targeted small molecule inhibitors can be used for natural product discovery. We envision the general strategy of combining metabolomics analysis with inhibitors of biosynthetic enzymes may be applied more broadly to enable studies of natural products which are difficult to isolate, synthesize, or study with genetic tools.</p><p id="Par31">Chemical modulation of gut microbial functions is a promising avenue both for therapeutic intervention and enabling basic research into the mechanisms of microbiota-host interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Applying this strategy to colibactin biosynthesis offers a new way to interrogate the relationships between this enigmatic natural product, the surrounding microbiota, their host and cancer. Using inhibitors like <bold>3</bold>, we can begin to understand how the duration and timing of colibactin exposure influence tumorigenesis. These inhibitors may also help illuminate the connection between colibactin and inflammation, which can be intermittent in the gut, but is essential for colibactin-related CRC in mouse models. In the long term, these molecules may serve as a starting point to evaluate colibactin biosynthesis as a therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of CRC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par32">For chemical synthesis procedures and compound characterization data, see Supplementary Note.

Each probing step was conducted for 90&#x02009;min at room temperature n 2.5% skim milk powder in TBST. Before imaging, blots were washed 3&#x02009;times for&#x02009;15&#x02009;min each in TBST. Blots were imaged using the SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) kit following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and imaged using an Azure Biosystems c300 imager.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par59">Further information on research design is available in the <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Online content</title><p id="Par60">Any methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at 10.1038/s41589-022-01147-8.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
