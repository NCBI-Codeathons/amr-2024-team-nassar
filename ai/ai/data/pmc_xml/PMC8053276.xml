Around 60% of the antibiotics used today were obtained from the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. The river sediments of Bangladesh are still an unexplored source for antibiotic-producing bacteria (APB). This study aimed to isolate novel APB from Padma and Kapotakkho river sediments having the potential to produce antibacterial&#x000a0;compounds with known scaffolds by manipulating their self-protection mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The antibiotic supplemented starch-casein-nitrate agar (SCNA) media were used to isolate antibiotic-resistant APB from the river sediments. The colonies having Streptomyces-like morphology were selectively purified and their antagonistic activity was screened against a range of test bacteria using the cross-streaking method. A notable decrease of the colony-forming units (CFUs) in the antibiotic supplemented SCNA plates compared to control plates (where added antibiotics were absent) was observed. A total of three azithromycin resistant (AZR) and nine meropenem resistant (MPR) isolates were purified and their antagonistic activity was investigated against a series of test bacteria including <italic>Shigella brodie</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas sp.</italic>, <italic>Proteus sp., Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>. All the AZR isolates and all but two MPR isolates exhibited moderate to high broad-spectrum activity. Among the isolates, 16S rDNA sequencing of NAr5 and NAr6 were performed to identify them up to species level. The analyses of the sequences revealed that both belong to the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The results from these studies suggest that manipulation of the self-resistance property of APB is an easy and quick method to search for novel APB having the potential to produce potentially novel antibacterial compounds with known scaffolds.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd><italic>Streptomyces</italic></kwd><kwd>Antibiotic-resistant isolates</kwd><kwd>16S rDNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100016173</institution-id><institution>Rajshahi University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Recurring Fund 2019-20</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Although the first natural antibiotic, penicillin, was discovered from a mould, <italic>Penicillium notatum</italic>, majority of the other clinically useful antibiotics including chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, etc. were obtained from a group of soil-dwelling filamentous gram-positive bacteria known as actinomycetes, particularly from the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. About 70% of the antibiotics that have been approved to use in humans are the secondary metabolites produced by actinomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the use of the traditional approach for screening of actinomycetes, known as the Waksman platform, to search for novel antibiotics was abandoned as this approach often resulted in the rediscovery of known compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, the failure of the pharmaceutical companies to identify novel scaffolds by screening the synthetic libraries and by using rational drug design led most companies to abandon antibiotic discovery research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Using the traditional screening approaches, several millions of actinomycetes colonies need to be screened to discover new antimicrobial compounds with known scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For instance, to find a glycopeptides antibiotic (GPA) producer, an estimated number of 150,000 strains of actinomycetes need to be screened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, using the resistance-based screening, a GPA-producing strain can be identified by screening only 10 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Moreover, exploration of the relatively untapped sources of antibiotic-producing bacteria (APB) especially the marine and extreme environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; screening the unculturable soil bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as well as human microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have resulted in the discovery of novel antimicrobials. For instance, using the isolation chip (iChip), teixobactin, a new class of antibiotics with novel scaffolds, was discovered from <italic>Eleftheria terrae</italic>, an unculturable soil bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Another new class of antibiotics, lugdunin, was discovered from <italic>Staphylococcus lugdunensis</italic>, a gram-positive bacterium colonising the human nasal cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pekiskomycin, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic (GPA) was discovered from <italic>Streptomyces sp.</italic> WAC4229 by selecting the GPA-producing organisms using vancomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These recent success stories on the discovery of novel antimicrobial compounds suggest that if the relatively untapped sources are explored with novel strategies, there is still a chance of obtaining new antibiotics with novel scaffolds.</p><p id="Par6">The sediments deposited at the riverbed consist of sand, soil, rocks, minerals as well as residues of plants and animals. The river sediments also contain a large number of bacteria, predominantly <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although there are reports on the isolation of actinomycetes producing antibacterial compounds from river sediments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], according to our knowledge, there are no studies on the isolation of APB from the river sediments of Bangladeshi rivers, thus, still, this source has remained untapped. Here, in this study, we have reported the isolation of actinomycetes from the river sediments of Bangladesh using the antibiotic resistance-guided approach. The results of antibiotic supplementation (azithromycin or meropenem) in the actinomycete isolation medium, the antibacterial activity of the antibiotic-resistant isolates as well as the identification of some selective bioactive isolates are also presented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Antibiotic supplementation in the SCNA media reduced the load of colonies on the isolation plates</title><p id="Par7">In this study, two antibiotics namely, azithromycin and meropenem were used separately to isolate drug-resistant actinomycetes with potential of producing antibiotics to which they possess self-resistance mechanisms. It was found that the antibiotic supplementation killed the susceptible bacterial species present in the sample and reduced the number of bacteria on the isolation plates by 4&#x02013;6 folds compared to the control plates where no antibiotics were added. This allowed only the drug-resistant actinomycetes to grow, especially the actinomycetes which are difficult to grow on the crowded plates. For instance, in SCNA plate containing 0.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL azithromycin where 100 &#x000b5;L of sediment sample (1:100 dilution) of Padma river was plated and the number of CFU/gram of soil was counted after 4 days of incubation at 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the number of CFU/gram of soil was 2.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>, however, in the control SCNA plates where no antibiotic was added, the CFU/gram of soil was 1.12&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). When the antibiotic concentration in the SCNA plates was increased, the number of CFU/gram of soil also decreased proportionately. For example, the CFU/gram of soil in the plates supplemented with 2, 4 and 16&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL of azithromycin, the values for CFU/gram of soil were 1.9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>, 1.1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> and 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup>, respectively.

A pH range of 5&#x02013;10 was tested and it was found that both the strains could also tolerate this wide range of pH. They also grew well when different carbohydrate sources were used including lactose, maltose, glucose, sucrose, mannitol, starch, fructose and xylose. Both of the strains could grow well in absence of carbon source (starch) of the SCNA medium supplemented with either meropenem or azithromycin. This suggests that they either utilize environmental CO<sub>2</sub> or the supplied antibiotic as a source of carbon. When the SCNA medium was depleted with nitrogen source (casein and potassium nitrate), the strains could also grow well, thus, there is a possibility that the strains used the supplied antibiotic as nitrogen source.

Among the platforms of antibiotic discovery, screening of soil-dwelling microorganisms, popularly known as Waksman platform was once most effective, however, due to the problem of the frequent rediscovery of known compounds, it has now collapsed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The relatively new platforms such as the target-based screening of the large libraries of synthetic compounds also failed, partly due to low penetration of the synthetic compounds into the bacterial cell. This problem can be overcome by using the resistance-guided isolation of antibiotic producers as in this approach small number of strains need to be screened and multiple environments can be sampled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The principle of the resistance-guided isolation method that led to the discovery of pekiskomycin was that the APB possess self-defense against their own product. When the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolation agar (SIA) or humic acid vitamin agar is supplemented with an antibiotic, the antibiotic-resistant strains that grow on agar media is likely the producer of antibiotics with similar scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Here in this study, we performed a resistance-guided screening of antibiotic-producing bacteria present in the river-bed sediments of Padma and Kapotakkho rivers of Bangladesh. Although several studies have been carried out previously to isolate the actinomycetes capable of producing bioactive compounds from soils and marine sediments from Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], no studies have been performed using the river bed sediments. We observed that supplementation of starch-casein-nitrate agar (SCNA) selective media with either azithromycin (a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic) or meropenem (a semisynthetic carbapenem) decreased the number of contaminating bacteria on the agar plates and thus, the total number of colonies appeared on the plates decreased significantly compared to the control plates where no antibiotics were supplemented. We have also seen that, when the concentration of the antibiotic is increased in the isolation media, there is a proportionate decrease of the colony counts on the plates. So, some of the actinomycetes strains that appear on a lower concentration did not appear on a higher concentration of antibiotics. At very high concentrations, in some cases, no actinomycetes like colonies appeared, and only some fungal colonies grew.</p><p id="Par18">The previous studies on supplementation of antibiotics for selection also produced similar results. For instance, when rifampicin was supplemented to the SCNA media to isolate actinomycetes from marine sediments, the number of CFU decreased with an increase in the concentration of rifampicin on the plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similarly, when vancomycin was supplemented to the isolation media, about 96% of the actinomycete strains that do not produce glycopeptide antibiotic (GPA), did not grow on the plates which allowed exclusive growth of resistant isolates that produce GPA. It also provided the opportunity to grow the slow-growing strains as well as the less-abundant actinomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Using the resistance-based isolation approach we found that 100% (3 out of 3) of the azithromycin resistant isolates exhibited antibacterial activities. Two of them (NAr5 and NAr6) exhibited broad-spectrum activity and one (NAr4) was active against the gram-negative bacteria only. However, in the case of meropenem-resistant actinomycete isolates, approximately 56% (5 out of 9) of the isolates exhibited antibacterial activity during the initial screening. The percentage of actinomycete isolates that exhibit antibacterial activity towards at least one type of bacteria (Gram-positive or Gram-negative) varies depending on the source. In a previous study conducted in our labs using the traditional Waksman approach, we found that about 54% of the actinomycetes obtained from various kinds of surface soils produced antibacterial compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In another study of screening for actinomycetes producing antibacterial compounds using the soils of Sundarban, Bangladesh, about 36% of the actinomycete isolate were active against the indicator bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In another study using the different kinds of samples (water and sediment) from both marine and freshwater sources, 23% of the isolates (27 out of 119) exhibited antibacterial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. During a screen of the soil samples of the West of Iran, the percentage of active isolates was only 13.30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, compared to these previous studies, screening of the antibiotic-producing actinomycetes using meropenem as a screening filter offered an increased output.</p><p id="Par20">Azithromycin is a semisynthetic broad-spectrum antibiotic of 15-membered-ring macrolide that works by inhibiting the protein synthesis of bacteria. Similar to erythromycin, it binds with the 50S large ribosomal subunit and inhibits the growth of the nascent polypeptide chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The mechanisms of resistance to azithromycin as well as other macrolides in the clinical pathogens include: i) target modifications by rRNA methylases or by mutations, ii) inactivation by esterases or by phosphotransferase and iii) macrolide-efflux pumps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the antibiotic-producing soil bacteria, the mechanisms of macrolide resistance include ribosomal modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], efflux-pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and inactivation by glycosyltransferase-mediated glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The mechanism of resistance by glycosylation has only been found in APB as a self-resistance mechanism and has not been reported in the clinical pathogens. For instance, oleandomycin producing <italic>Streptomyces antibioticus</italic> confers self-resistance by 2&#x02019;-glucosylation of the antibiotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Macrolide resistance in <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> also occurs due to glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Considering these examples of macrolide resistance mechanisms in both clinical pathogens and the antibiotic producing soil bacteria, it can be suggested that azithromycin-resistant isolates of our study used the target modification or the efflux pumps as their resistance mechanisms.</p><p id="Par21">Meropenem is a member of carbapenems which possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, having a distinctive structure of a carbapenem coupled to a &#x003b2;-lactam ring which exhibits defence against a range of &#x003b2; lactamases such as Metallo-&#x003b2;-lactamase (MBL) as well as extended-spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Meropenem possesses a common beta-lactam ring-like other &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics, and act similarly by binding to and inactivating the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are responsible for the development of the bacterial cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The most common mechanisms of meropenem resistance, as well as other carbapenems in the clinical pathogens, include: (i) enzymatic inactivation by &#x003b2;-lactam-hydrolyzing enzymes, (ii) target site mutation (mutation-derived from changes of their PBPs), and (iii) overexpression of efflux pumps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Antibiotic producing soil bacteria develop resistance to meropenem as well as other carbapenems through (i) producing carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes (carbapenemases) (ii) decreasing outer membrane permeability, and (iii) increasing efflux mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The analysis of 16S rDNA sequences of NAr5 and NAr6 revealed that both belong to the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.
