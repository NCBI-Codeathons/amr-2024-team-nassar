Introduction</title><p>Pseudouridimycin (PUM) is a novel bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibitor that was discovered in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. DSM26212 and characterized by Maffioli et al. in 2017 [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The DNA-dependent bacterial RNAP is a target for antibiotics that is of proven interest for antibiotic drug development. Known inhibitors are the rifamycins, e.g., rifampicin that is applied in treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, and AIDS-associated mycobacterial infections [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; the lipiarmycins, e.g., the narrow-spectrum antibiotic fidaxomicin used for treatment of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>-related infections [<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; &#x003b1;-pyrone antibiotics, e.g., corallopyronin and myxopyronin, both currently under preclinical evaluation [<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. All these antibiotics block transcription by binding to RNAP, which results either in a steric blocking of nascent RNA chain extension after the first or second condensation step (i.e., rifamycins), by inhibition of transcription initiation through binding to the DNA template&#x02013;RNAP complex (i.e., lipiarmycins), or by blocking the hinge region of the RNAP (i.e., &#x003b1;-pyrone antibiotics). PUM in contrast competes with uracil triphosphate (UTP) for access to the active site cavity of the RNAP. Thereby, incorporation of UTP nucleotides to the growing RNA chain is blocked. This represents a novel mode of action, rendering the compound an interesting lead structure for further investigation and development.</p><p>The biosynthetic pathway of PUM and a corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was identified and characterized by knockout (KO) experiments [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, production of the pseudouridine nucleoside antibiotic strepturidin by <italic>Streptomyces albus</italic> DSM40763 was recently reinvestigated and it could be shown that strepturidin is actually PUM. However, the structural assignment in the initial report was found to be not correct [<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Genetic analysis of <italic>S. albus</italic> DSM40763 also revealed the presence of the PUM BGC in this strain [<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For manufacture of PUM, nine catalytic steps were proposed [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thereby, in a first step, uridine nucleotides are converted to pseudouridine nucleotides and subsequently become dephosphorylated by the catalytic action of the pseudouridine synthase PumJ and the phosphatase PumD to yield free pseudouridine (PU). Via intermediate creation of 5&#x02032;-oxo-PU and subsequent transamination, 5&#x02032;-amino-PU (APU) is formed by PumI, catalyzing oxidation of the 5&#x02032; hydroxyl group to a keto group, and PumG, catalyzing transamination at the 5&#x02032; position with asparagine as NH<sub>3</sub> donor. Then, APU is linked to glutamine by PumK, yielding Gln-APU. In parallel, glycine is converted to guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) by transguanylation (PumN catalyzed), which is subsequently fused to Gln-APU by PumM, resulting in formation of deoxy-PUM. The final biosynthetic step is hydroxylation of the peptide bond/amidic nitrogen between Gln and GAA by PumE. The identified BGC consists of 15 genes (<italic>pumA</italic>-<italic>pumO</italic>). For seven of these genes (i.e., <italic>pumE</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, <italic>J</italic>, <italic>K</italic>, <italic>M</italic>, and <italic>N</italic>), a function could be assigned by experimental data. For five genes (i.e., <italic>pumB</italic>, <italic>C</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, and <italic>L</italic>), a function was proposed based on sequence homology. Hence, each of the nine proposed steps was at least in silico matched with a corresponding enzyme from the PUM BGC [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The gene <italic>pumH</italic> that is situated within the BGC was proposed to function as an adenylate kinase, based on sequence homology. However, no biosynthetic step could be readily assigned, since it could not be matched to one of the proposed biosynthetic steps in PUM biosynthesis [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Deleting the gene from the WT producer strain resulted in a significant drop in production but not in a complete abolition of PUM production. Additionally, one regulator and two transporter genes (i.e., <italic>pumB</italic>, <italic>pumL</italic>) could be readily identified based on homology. In the first reports, no function was assigned to the genes <italic>pumA</italic>, <italic>pumF</italic> and <italic>pumO</italic> in PUM biosynthesis. However, the <italic>pumF</italic> analogue <italic>mur33</italic> is present in the muraymycin C1 BGC, the latter an uridine nucleoside itself.</p><p>Here, the heterologous expression of the PUM BGC in the commonly used surrogate host <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> M1146 is described. Therefore, the BGC was streamlined (i.e., all genes proposed to be essential for the biosynthesis were cloned facing in the same direction and were set under the control of one promoter) and several constructs were generated to identify the minimal BGC necessary for heterologous production of the nucleoside antibiotic. Only the construct harboring, in addition to the described nine biosynthetic steps, the genes <italic>pumH</italic> and <italic>pumF</italic>, the latter showing sequence similarities to genes encoding for a serine/threonine protein kinase, resulted in reliable PUM biosynthesis in the heterologous host applied. Thereby, evidence is presented that the enzyme PumF is essential for PUM biosynthesis by regulating enzymatic activity in the biosynthetic pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-26-00510"><title>2. Results</title><p>The nucleoside-analog inhibitor PUM represents a highly hydrophilic compound. First, the experimental setup for detection of PUM was tested. Therefore, the reported wild-type producer strain <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. DSM26212 was cultivated in production medium (PM medium) for 5 days. The fermentation broth was cleared by centrifugation as well as filtration and PUM was enriched by strong cation-exchange chromatography, as previously described [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Subsequent high-resolution liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS) analysis revealed the presence of PUM, ionizing as [M + H]<sup>+</sup> ion in the enriched fraction. The identity of this ion could be corroborated by MS/MS fragmentation pattern analysis. A plausible decay mechanism yielding the observed fragments was proposed and fragments observed in the experiment could be matched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00510-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>To generate a heterologous expression platform for PUM production, a streamlined assembly of the BGC was envisaged, meaning only genes involved in the biosynthesis should be cloned and it was planned to assemble the genes in a way that all face the same direction. However, to avoid autotoxicity, the genes <italic>pumB</italic> and <italic>pumL</italic>, encoding major facilitator superfamily (MFS)-type transporters, which might be essential for self-resistance, should be incorporated into all expression constructs. As a first construct, the previously identified genes to which a function in PUM biosynthesis was assigned (by experimental proof and, in some cases, putatively based on sequence similarity) were amplified from the natural producer strain <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. DSM26212 and were cloned into the <italic>E. coli</italic>/<italic>Streptomyces</italic> shuttle vector pCAP03. Hence, the genes <italic>pumB</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, <italic>I</italic>&#x02013;<italic>M</italic> were assembled in the shuttle vector and the resulting construct pCAP03-PUM&#x00394;F&#x00394;H was outfitted either with the constitutive <italic>Streptomyces</italic> ermE* promotor, or the inducible tcp830 promoter by &#x003bb;RED recombination, whereby the latter has a lower expression strength than ermE* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00510-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Subsequently, these constructs were transferred into <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> M1146 [<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] by conjugation. Fermentation was performed in complex medium, i.e., in International Streptomyces Project medium 2 (ISP2) and tryptic soy broth (TSB). Thereby, the cultures carrying the tcp830 promoter were induced by addition of anhydrotetracycline (2 mg/L) to the cultures after one day of growth. PUM production was analyzed after 3 and 5 days of fermentation by UHPLC&#x02013;MS using the cleared culture broth. <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> M1146-pCAP03 (empty vector) served as negative control. However, heterologous expression using the construct pCAP03-PUM&#x00394;F&#x00394;H (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00510-f002">Figure 2</xref>, version I) did not result in detectable PUM production at all. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a lack of correctly phosphorylated uridine precursors prevents detectable PUM production. To verify this assumption, the adenylate kinase encoding <italic>pumH</italic>, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of a uridine-based substrate, was added to the construct, resulting in pCAP03-PUM&#x00394;F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00510-f002">Figure 2</xref>, version II). Heterologous expression using the latter construct enabled detection of minor traces of an ion corresponding to the calculated mass/charge ratio of the PUM [M + H]<sup>+</sup> adduct. Such an ion was not present in the negative control. This result pointed towards the fact that this could be regarded as the minimal gene set necessary for production of PUM. However, it was questionable whether this very low expression yield justifies this as the minimal BGC. </p><p>It was next determined whether a further gene is essential to enable a valid PUM biosynthesis. A promising candidate was <italic>pumF</italic>, which is located right in the middle of the BGC. BLASTp of the translated nucleotide sequence revealed homology to the <italic>mur33</italic>-encoded protein (77% query coverage; 43% identity) in the BGC coding for muraymycin C1&#x02014;the latter another nucleoside natural product. BLASTp search of <italic>pumF</italic> and <italic>mur33</italic> showed homology (48% and 50%) to predicted serine/threonine protein kinases of Actinomycetes. Based on these observations, the <italic>pumF</italic> gene was incorporated into the expression construct pCAP03-PUM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00510-f002">Figure 2</xref>, version III). Fermentation of an heterologous host carrying the expression construct pCAP03-PUM_ermE*, in which the PUM genes are under control of the ermE* promotor, in ISP2 medium led to detection of a low intensity ion with <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 487.1856 after 5 days incubation time. This matched the PUM sum formula of C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>26</sub>N<sub>8</sub>O<sub>9</sub> [M + H]<sup>+</sup> (8 ppm error) and retention time, and this ion was absent in the empty vector control. Prolonged incubation (20 days) of the strain led to accumulation of this ion and allowed more accurate detection with <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 487.1896 (0 ppm error) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00510-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, targeted MS/MS fragmentation of this ion revealed the presence of the characteristic signature ion of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 244.0920, which is indicative for the APU fragment (3 ppm error). Thus, the identity of the molecule as PUM was verified and the (indirect) involvement of PumF in PUM biosynthesis was shown. However, no ions corresponding to PUM could be detected in cultures grown in TSB medium and in strains that were harboring the expression constructs in which the streamlined BGC was under the control of the tcp830 promotor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-molecules-26-00510"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Previously, the biosynthesis of PUM was characterized by generation of KO mutants in the WT producer strain <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. DSM26212. Nine catalytic steps were proposed for the formation of PUM and all steps were matched with plausible enzymatic functions encoded within the BGC, proposing the minimal PUM BGC [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While the involvement of the <italic>pumH</italic>-encoded protein in PUM biosynthesis was corroborated by the KO experiments, it was also shown that deletion of <italic>pumH</italic> from the WT producer did lead to a drastically reduced production yield but not to abolition of PUM biosynthesis. Thereby, this result pointed towards a rather regulatory function of PumH. It was reasoned that PumH as adenylate kinase alters the phosphorylation pattern of the precursor uridine, which in turn could be processed into pseudouridine. However, when lacking PumH, free pseudouridine could be sourced in small amounts from tRNA turnover derived from primary metabolism, thereby enabling minute production of PUM [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This gives evidence that PumH has a gatekeeper function in funneling uridine-based nucleotides (UMP or UDP) as precursor molecules towards the PUM pathway. This is important for the producing organism in order to ensure that the uridine pool designated to transcription and translation is not drained for PUM production. In this way, PumH would decouple PUM biosynthesis from the primary metabolism uridine pool. However, heterologous expression of the identified genes in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> M1146, a specialized expression host that shows reduced metabolic background (since several BGCs for specialized metabolites were deleted) [<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], including and excluding <italic>pumH</italic> did not lead to clearly detectable production of PUM (i.e., only constructs including <italic>pumH</italic> resulted in traces of PUM at the detection limit). This showed that heterologous production was not only bottlenecked by absence of PumH and provoked the question whether the proposed biosynthetic route covers all steps, hence whether the proposed minimal PUM BGC is correct or whether further important functions are encoded in the BGC.</p><p>Further investigation aimed towards identification of a gene, vital for heterologous manufacture of PUM. Here, <italic>pumF</italic> could be identified as the most-promising candidate: the <italic>pumF</italic> gene is located right in the middle of the BGC and shows homology to the gene <italic>mur33</italic> (77% query coverage; 43% identity) in the BGC coding for the nucleoside muraymycin C1. Furthermore, both encoded proteins show homology to predicted serine/threonine protein kinases of Actinomycetes. Enzyme phosphorylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications, often involved in regulation of enzyme activity, i.e., activating or inactivating a given enzyme [<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, it seemed reasonable to assume that this gene is indirectly involved in the PUM biosynthesis, by regulating the activity of one or more enzymes participating in assembly of the molecule. Heterologous expression of the previously identified minimal BGC incorporating <italic>pumF</italic> led to detectable PUM formation. Thereby, involvement of PumF in the PUM biosynthesis was corroborated.</p><p>It has to be emphasized that the presented results do not contradict the initially proposed biosynthetic route [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; instead, heterologous expression is a further proof of the PUM BGC. However, the collected data here clearly show that the genes <italic>pumH</italic> and <italic>pumF</italic> are vital for heterologous PUM production and hence should be considered components of the minimal BGC necessary for PUM biosynthesis as well. Based on the obtained results, we propose that the genes <italic>pumD</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, <italic>J</italic>, <italic>K</italic>, <italic>M</italic>, and <italic>N</italic> code for enzymes directly participating in de novo formation of PUM, while <italic>pumH</italic> serves as a decoupling mechanism of PUM biosynthesis from primary metabolism, as demonstrated before by KO experiments [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It seems that the function of PumH is provision of phosphorylated uridine nucleosides that can serve as a substrate for the pseudouridine synthase PumJ. However, the exact biochemistry catalyzed by PumH requires in-depth investigation in future studies. The nature of the &#x02019;correct&#x02019; phosphorylation pattern remains enigmatic to a certain degree, since UTP, UDP and UMP (analogous to ATP, ADP and AMP) naturally occur in primary metabolism, which PUM biosynthesis is decoupled from by PumH. This might be considered a hint towards cryptic nucleoside phosphorylation for precursor molecules, similar to biosynthesis of the uridine nucleoside analogue natural products nikkomycin Z and polyoxin D [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00510" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>pumF</italic> gene encodes a regulatory protein controlling the enzymatic activity of one (or more) of the participating enzymes by post-translational phosphorylation. Due to the presence of minor traces of an ion consistent with PUM, it remains possible that the target enzyme of PumF can retain (poor) activity even in the wrong phosphorylation state or that minor amounts of protein undergo phosphorylation from other serine/threonine kinases from the surrogate hosts genetic background with certain promiscuity.</p><p>Despite the proof that the presence of <italic>pumF</italic> is important for PUM biosynthesis, the precise function of PumF remains to be elucidated in future studies, since currently the kinase activity is not proven and a protein target is unknown. Furthermore, heterologous production of PUM was achieved; however, the yields were too low to use this strain as a plug-and-play production platform for PUM and its biosynthetic precursors. Therefore, it would be a long way to optimize production in heterologous strains and future work should continue to focus on WT producer strains, which are also genetically accessible and could be optimized in untargeted ways (i.e., random mutagenesis) and by targeted genetic engineering.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-26-00510"><title>4.

Plasmid restriction analysis was performed using standard techniques and NEB enzymes, and DNA fragments were analyzed on 1% or 2% TAE-Agarose gels using MidoriGreen as loading dye and stain and a UV-free blue light transilluminator. GeneRuler 1 kb Plus was used as marker. DNA for cloning purposes was excised from the gel and purified using the Zymoclean large fragment DNA recovery kit according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. DNA concentrations were determined with an Eppendorf BioSpectrometer using a 1 mm light path cuvette. <italic>E. coli</italic> were transformed with DNA using the standard electroporation methodology. Subsequently, transformants were plated on LB agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics.

The plasmid vector pIJ773 was isolated and the promotors ermE* and tcp830 were fused to the <italic>aac(3)</italic> apramycin antibiotic resistance cassette by PCR using Q5 as polymerase and pIJ773 as template. The forward primer used was pIJ773cass_f and tcp830, and ermEp1 and ermEp2 served as reverse primers. Due to the size of the ermE* promotor, amplification had to take place in two individual PCR reactions. Therefore, the first segment of the promotor was fused to the pIJ773-derived <italic>aac(3)</italic> apramycin antibiotic resistance cassette by using ermEp1 as reverse primer for the first PCR. The resulting product was subsequently used as template for the second PCR, with ermEp2 as reverse primer. Final constructs were outfitted with an A overhang by incubating the Q5 PCR fragments with GoTaq polymerase. Therefore, the standard reaction mixture without primers was applied at 72 &#x000b0;C for 1 h. Final products were gel purified and ligated into pGEM-t easy, using pGEM-t easy vector systems (Promega) according to the manufacturer&#x000b4;s instructions and introduced into <italic>E. coli</italic> XL1 blue by electroporation. Correct fusion of the promotors was corroborated by sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-molecules-26-00510"><title>4.6.

DSM26212 was grown in 30 mL ISP2 medium for 3 days and genomic DNA was extracted; <italic>E. coli</italic> Top10 + pCAP03 was grown in 5 mL LB<sub>kan</sub> overnight and the plasmid was isolated. The PUM BGC was amplified in several parts with primer pairs pumB_f/r, pumD_f/r, pumG_f/r, pumE_f/pumEdH_r, pumI_f/pumJ_r and pumK_f/pumN_r for pCAP03-PUM&#x00394;F&#x00394;H, pumB_f/r, pumD_f/r, pumG_f/r, pumE_f/r, pumH_f/pumJ_r and pumK_f/pumN_r for pCAP03-PUM&#x00394;F and pumB_f/r, pumD_f/r, pumG_f/pumG+F_r, pumE_f/pumE_r, pumF_f/r, pumH_f/pumJ_r and pumK_f/pumN_r for pCAP03-PUM, respectively, using isolated genomic DNA as a template. pCAP03 was amplified in two parts using the primer pairs pCAP03_1f/r and pCAP03_2f/r and linearized (<italic>Nde</italic>I, <italic>Xho</italic>I) pCAP03 as a template. DNA fragments were gel purified and fused by isothermal assembly using self-made isothermal assembly master mix. In brief, 15 &#x000b5;L of isothermal assembly master mix was thawed on ice and equimolar concentrations of all fragments were mixed in 5 &#x000b5;L and added to the master mix.

Apramycin resistance cassette/promotor fusions were amplified with the primers Rec_uni_f as forward primer and PUM_ermE*_rec and PUM_tcp830_rec as reverse primer, respectively. Thereby, 40 nucleotide homologous overhangs for introduction of promotors into the construct were added.
