Among the existing enediynes, the anthraquinone-fused 10-membered enediynes (AFEs) possess a unique structure feature with a anthraquinone moiety and an enediyne core in one compact molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], in which the anthraquinone moiety is presumed to not only conjugately stabilize the enediyne core, but also play an important role in the interaction with DNA and associated biological activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. So far, there are six groups of known AFEs with an aromatized one, which include Yangpumicins (YPMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], Uncialamycin (UCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], Sungeidines (SGDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], Dynemicins (DYNs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], Sealutotomycins (SLMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and Tiancimycins (TNMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but only five of them have reported biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Recent studies have revealed the prospects of AFEs in development of antitumor ADCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], but the insufficient yields of AFEs become a practical challenge to limit their prospective applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despites many efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the improvement of the titers of typical AFEs such as TNMs and YPMs remains too limited to satisfy practical requirements for industrialization. Since AFEs are causing DNA breakage and thus are lethal for their producers. Such potent inherent toxicity has forced the producers to evolve complex regulatory network to strictly control their productions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Summarized biosynthetic studies of AFEs: <bold>A</bold> The putative unified biosynthetic pathway with the formation of two essential AFE intermediates (highlighted by shadow) to generate different groups of AFEs, the involved core enzymes or their homologs were indicated; <bold>B</bold> The reported BGCs of AFEs with marked core genes (red) and putative regulatory genes (green)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12934_2022_1916_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">Owing to the unique structural feature and the promising prospects in drug development, extensive studies have been addressed to the biosynthesis of AFEs, mainly on DYNs, SGDs and TNMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although not fully elucidated, the solved major biosynthetic steps of DYNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have revealed a unified principal pathway for AFEs biosynthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Briefly, the key precursor iodoathracene of anthraquinone moiety and the 10-membered enediyne core are both synthesized by the conserved enediyne polyketide synthase cassette (DynE7/E8/T3/U14/U15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These two parts are enzymatically coupled (Dyn14/16) to form the pivotal AFE intermediate <bold>1</bold>
<sup>15</sup>, which then either shunts into a degenerative pathway to produce SGDs through a series of rearrangements, or undergoes further multi-step enzymatic reactions (DynE13/A1/A2/A4/A5) to generate a core AFE intermediate <bold>2</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. All AFEs except SGDs are derived from <bold>2</bold> by various post-modification steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], including TNMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is noteworthy that iodine is essential for biosynthesis of AFEs because of the formation of key precursor iodoathracene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite of different tailoring genes, the core genes involved in the biosynthesis of AFE scaffold, as well as multiple putative regulatory genes, are highly conserved among all AFE BGCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B), whereas the nature of tailoring genes varies. Therefore, the productions of AFEs may share similar regulatory features.</p><p id="Par24">In <italic>Streptomycetes</italic>, productions of secondary metabolites, especially antibiotics, are usually under the controls of various pleiotropic and pathway-specific regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], in which the former ordinarily impact the whole metabolic network while the latter often directly control the target biosynthetic pathway. As the major type of pleiotropic regulator, two-component regulatory system consists of sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR), which are usually adjacent together to sense and respond to various stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], such as the well-known PhoR-PhoP system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Two-component regulatory systems are important for signal transductions and generally participate in different global regulations, while a few of them could also modulate antibiotic productions like cephamycin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], salinomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], oxytetracycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and etc. On the other hand, the manipulation of pathway-specific regulator is a general strategy used for titer improvement of many important antibiotics such as platensimycin, a 9-membered enediyne C-1027 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The progresses on biosynthetic and genomic studies have revealed that the regulation of antibiotic biosynthetic pathways was more complex than anticipated. For instance, the production of polyene antibiotic candicidin was shown to be controlled by a hierarchical regulatory network consisting of four regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The existence of multiple different regulatory genes in AFE BGCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B) suggested the existence of regulatory cascades governing AFEs productions. Therefore, the exploration of cryptic AFE pathway regulatory networks will enable us to gain more insights in the regulation of AFEs biosynthesis and that is essential for their future titer improvement.</p><p id="Par25">In previous work, we have obtained a ribosome engineering mutant <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp.CB03234-S with the enhanced titers of TNMs (mainly TNM-A/D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and revealed a global regulator WblA as the key factor repressing TNMs biosynthesis in CB03234-S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. On the basis of these preliminary results, TNMs biosynthesis was chosen as a model to investigate general pathway-specific regulatory mechanisms of AFEs biosynthesis. In this work, five putative regulatory genes found in the BGC of TNMs (<italic>tnm</italic>) were first genetically characterized to evaluate their potential effects on the cell growth and the production of TNMs in CB03234-S. Then a series of transcriptional analyses were carried out to decipher possible pathway-specific regulations in the biosynthesis of TNMs. Finally, an unconventional but stringent regulatory network for the production of TNMs was proposed. Our results unveiled a generic regulatory network for production of AFEs, which shall provide new insights in future titer improvement of AFEs and potential dynamic regulatory applications in synthetic biology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genetic characterization of putative TNM pathway-specific regulators</title><p id="Par26">The 5 putative <italic>tnm</italic> regulatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] were classified based on the amino acid sequence alignment and conserved domain search in NCBI (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1). This analysis revealed that <italic>tnmR1</italic> encodes an HxIR family transcriptional regulator, <italic>tnmR7</italic> and <italic>tnmR4</italic> encode AraC family transcriptional regulators, <italic>tnmR2</italic> and <italic>tnmR3</italic> encoded AarF/ABC1/UbiB kinase family proteins. Each <italic>tnm</italic> regulatory gene was respectively knocked out or overexpressed in CB03234-S (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2) to evaluate their possible influence on the production of TNMs. The fermentation results of derived mutants suggested that only TnmR1, TnmR3 and TnmR7 were involved with the production of TNMs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Among them, TnmR7 was a typical positive regulator since the production of TNMs was improved 1.3-fold by its overexpression but abolished by its deletion, whereas the roles of TnmR1 and TnmR3 were somewhat elusive. The deletion of TnmR3 evidently reduced the titer of TNMs for about fivefold, but its overexpression had no obvious effect, while either deletion or overexpression of TnmR1 could significantly decrease the production of TNMs.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Genetic characterization of putative TNM pathway-specific regulators: <bold>A</bold> The comparisons of TNMs titer (bar chart) and corresponding biomass (dot with dash line) at the seventh day; <bold>B</bold> The comparison of growth curves from S, the overexpression mutants of <italic>tnmR1</italic> (S-<italic>R1</italic>), <italic>tnmR3</italic> (S-<italic>R3</italic>) and <italic>tnmR7</italic> (S-<italic>R7</italic>), as well as the knockout mutant of <italic>tnmR7</italic> (S-<italic>&#x00394;R7</italic>); <bold>C</bold> The comparison of growth curves from S and the knockout mutant of <italic>tnmR1</italic> (S-<italic>&#x00394;R1</italic>) or <italic>tnmR3</italic> (S-<italic>&#x00394;R3</italic>) cultivated with or without iodine</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12934_2022_1916_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par27">Subsequent measurements of dry cell weight (DCW) indicated that the overexpression of any of the three regulators, or the deletion of TnmR7 had no apparent impact on the biomass of CB03434-S (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). In contrast, the deletion of either TnmR1 or TnmR3 notably impaired cell growth during exponential phase (24&#x000a0;h&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h) and caused rapid cell death. Such deleterious effects could be totally relieved when the corresponding mutants were cultivated in absence of iodine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Therefore, the reduced titer of TNMs in TnmR1 or TnmR3 deletion mutant could be attributed to the substantial decrease of biomass. Because iodine is essential for the formation of key AFE precursor iodoathracene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the observed growth inhibition could be correlated with the intracellular accumulation of TNMs, which were extremely cytotoxic, prompting DNA breakage and thus inducing cell death. Hence, we speculated that TnmR1 and TnmR3 act together as a negative regulatory system to restrict the production of TNMs, so the deletion of either one would allow the biosynthesis of TNMs at the early stage of fermentation, resulting into premature cell death.</p><p id="Par28">The five reported AFE BGCs all contain 4 to 8 putative pathway-specific regulatory genes belonging to different types and present at distinct locations in each BGC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). The sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis at an E-value threshold of 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup> grouped these 29 genes into 5 clusters (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3). Among them, the 3 major clusters represented by <italic>tnmR1</italic>, <italic>tnmR3</italic> and <italic>tnmR7</italic> were conserved in all BGCs of AFEs. This bioinformatic analysis together with the outcome of our genetic studies suggested that the productions of AFEs may share a similar regulatory mechanism. So, the exploration of regulatory network in the production of TNMs is of a certain significance to acquire better understandings of biosynthesis of AFEs and guide their future industrial development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Determination of transcription units in <italic>tnm</italic> and subsequent qRT-PCR analyses of various regulatory gene mutants</title><p id="Par29">Due to the diversity of gene arrangements, the possible transcription units in <italic>tnm</italic> were first determined by RT-PCR. Among all 25 intergenic regions found in <italic>tnm</italic>, those being between the "tail to tail" adjacent genes, or being less than 50&#x000a0;bp long were excluded, the remaining 13 intergenic regions contain promoters were subjected for RT-PCR analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). Using cDNA originating from CB03234-S as a template, any intergenic region embodied in transcription unit would give a clear PCR product, whereas those failing to generate PCR fragments could constitute promoter areas delimiting different transcription units. Our RT-PCR results revealed 7 promoter regions delimiting 7 transcription units (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4), plus 3 natural intervals between the "tail to tail" adjacent genes delimiting 4 transcription units. The TNM biosynthetic pathway could thus be divided into 11 possible transcription units (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). At least one gene was chosen from each transcription unit except for the last one.

The expression level of target gene enhanced or decreased more than tenfold was considered as significant. As the results, no obvious expression changes on the majority of target genes were observed either in <italic>tnmR2</italic> and <italic>tnmR4</italic> related mutants (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5), or the overexpression mutants of <italic>tnmR7</italic> and <italic>tnmR3</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B).

Similar down-regulations but involved more genes were also found in S-<italic>R1</italic>, in which <italic>tnmR7</italic>, <italic>tnmK2</italic>, <italic>tnmT1</italic> and <italic>tnmS1</italic> should be directly controlled by TnmR1, while other genes might be hierarchically regulated through the mediation of TnmR7 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Most notably, the down-regulation of <italic>tnmO</italic> in both two mutants was in the same level, but the expression of <italic>tnmD</italic> was further decreased in S-<italic>R1</italic> to almost 700-fold, suggesting a potential superposed regulatory effect of TnmR1 on <italic>tnmD</italic>. On the other hand, the gene expression changes at 48H in S-<italic>&#x00394;R1</italic> and S-<italic>&#x00394;R3</italic> were almost opposite (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). Most of genes showed a up-regulated trend in S-<italic>&#x00394;R3</italic>, which was reasonable due to the impairment of the negative regulation system; whereas the repressed trend of these genes in S-<italic>&#x00394;R1</italic> could probably more relate to the premature death of cells, which was in accord with the lower biomass and titer of S-<italic>&#x00394;R1</italic>.</p><p id="Par31">Based on qRT-PCR results, we deduced that TnmR7 could promote the transcriptions of the fourth (<italic>tnmDFGH</italic>), eighth (<italic>tnmM1M2</italic>) and ninth (<italic>tnmNOPR2</italic>) units, while TnmR1 (probably with the assistance of TnmR3) could repress the transcriptions of the first (<italic>tnmR7E6</italic>), seventh (<italic>tnmJK1K2L</italic>) tenth (<italic>tnmT2R4S2T1S1Q</italic>) and possibly fourth (<italic>tnmDFGH</italic>) units.

Therefore, TnmR1 and TnmR7 played important but opposite roles in the regulation of the formation of two crucial AFE intermediates, and thus impacted the production of TNMs. Besides, TnmR1 was on the higher level in this cascade regulatory network, it not only hierarchically controlled TnmR7, but also governed the expressions of core enzymes, as well as auxiliary proteins that are important for the resistance and transport of TNMs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Establishment of the possible regulatory network for the production of TNMs</title><p id="Par32">To validate the potential bindings between seven promoter regions of transcription units and two regulators TnmR1 and TnmR7, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] was subsequently carried out. Either <italic>tnmR1</italic> or <italic>tnmR7</italic> was first heterologously expressed with the fusion of typical His-tag at the C-terminal. The 28.7 kD TnmR1-His<sub>6</sub> was successfully obtained and purified in the soluble form, but the 34.7 kD TnmR7-His<sub>6</sub> was insoluble and could not be resolubilized (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6). The hydrophilicity analysis of TnmR7 revealed that its N-terminal part bears very hydrophobic region, so different truncated forms of <italic>tnmR7</italic> retaining the intact HTH domain with the entire N-terminal or without the hydrophobic region (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7A) were expressed. Despite numerous trials under various conditions including different temperatures and the addition of different amount of IPTG, we could not obtain soluble proteins (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7A). Meanwhile, different molecular chaperones, such as PGR07, PTF16 and PGT12, or the pGEX-2T fusion system containing glutathione-S-transferase, were individually adopted, but all failed to make the soluble expression of TnmR7 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7B). Therefore, only TnmR1-His<sub>6</sub> was subjected to the EMSA by binding with biotin-labeled promoter regions<bold>.</bold></p><p id="Par33">Among seven target promoter regions, TnmR1 showed a clear but only moderate interaction with <italic>tnmB-tnmR3</italic> (between unit 2 and 3), <italic>tnmC-tnmD</italic> (between unit 3 and 4), <italic>tnmR1-tnmJ</italic> (between unit 6 and 7) and <italic>tnmT2-tnmS3</italic> (between unit 10 and 11), respectively. In contrast, TnmR1 had no interaction with tnmI-tnmR1 (between unit 5 and 6) and tnmM2-tnmN (between unit 8 and 9) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). These EMSAs results were basically consistent with the qRT-PCR data obtained with the TnmR1 mutant. It was noteworthy that single TnmR1 seemed to only partially bind with target promoter regions. Although the real function of TnmR3 was not validated, its deletion phenotype was very similar to that of TnmR1, which suggested that TnmR3 may act as an orphan sensor kinase to enhance the regulatory effect of TnmR1, and they together formed a special two-component regulatory system to strictly control the biosynthesis of TNMs. Although two-component regulatory systems are abundant in streptomycetes and could affect antibiotic production through cascade regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], they have seldom been encoded by genes situating in BGCs and acted as pathway-specific regulators. It had been reported that <italic>lipReg1/2</italic> in the BGC of acyclic polyene &#x003b1;-lipomycin were encoding a putative two-component regulatory system, but LipReg1 and LipReg2 just indirectly influenced the production of &#x003b1;-lipomycin through a pathway-specific regulator LipReg4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, TnmR1 and TnmR3, as well as their homologs from other AFEs, represented a rare type of unconventional orphan two-component regulatory system to directly control the biosynthesis of AFEs like TNMs.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Establishment of a possible regulatory network for the production of TNMs: <bold>A</bold> The EMSA results of 7 biotin-labeled promoter regions with or without the presence of TnmR1; <bold>B</bold> The proposed delicate regulatory network to control the biosynthesis of TNMs (the black solid line means the results of TnmR1 were validated by both qRT-PCR and EMSA, the red dash line means the results of TnmR7 were deduced from qRT-PCR, the black bold dash line indicates the enhanced regulations of phosphorylated TnmR1, the blue dash box means the result was speculated from the genetical characterization)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12934_2022_1916_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par34">Based on the obtained overall results, a cascade regulatory network, which consisted with a higher class negative two-component regulatory system TnmR3/R1 and a positive regulator TnmR7, was proposed to orchestrate the production of TNMs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). During the growth stage, TnmR3 could sense primary metabolic signals to phosphorylate TnmR1, which then tightly bind with target promoter regions to repress the transcriptions of core enzymes TnmJ/K1/K2, the resistance &#x00026; transport system TnmT2/S2/T1/S1 and the negative control system itself. Besides, the phosphorylated TnmR1 could not only compete with TnmR7 at the same promoter region to down-regulate the expressions of core enzymes TnmD/G, but also disturb the transcription of TnmR7 to repress the expressions of another group of core enzymes TnmN/O/P. Since these core enzymes are essential for the formation of key AFE intermediates <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, the stringent regulation on their transcriptions by TnmR3/R1 could inhibit the production of lethal TNMs and therefore ensure the normal growth of host cells. When the primary metabolism is declined at the stationary stage of fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the changes of primary metabolic signals could make TnmR3 inert, and the initial TnmR1 with the much weaker binding ability is unable to persist the strict regulation. As a result, the transcriptions of those core enzymes as well as the positive regulator TnmR7 are partially released and thus enabled the production of TNMs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par35">In conclusion, our work revealed that the production of highly toxic TNMs, a group of potential antitumor ADC payloads, was stringently controlled by the pathway-specific cascade regulatory network, which consists with a higher class unconventional orphan two-component regulatory system TnmR3/R1 and a positive regulator TnmR7. As the principal part of regulatory network, TnmR3/R1 mainly repressed the transcriptions of different proteins related to the biosynthesis of TNMs, including TnmR7 and core enzymes involved with the formation of essential common AFE intermediates, as well as auxiliary proteins important for the resistance and transport of TNMs. Besides that, TnmR3/R1 was proposed to dynamically regulate the expressions of target genes by sensing the change of primary metabolic signals. Through this delicate regulatory network, the host could tactfully avoid the early production of TNMs and accompanying lethal effects to ensure the normal growth of cells.</p><p id="Par36">Since the biosynthesis of AFEs are suggested to share a unified principal pathway, and the homologues of <italic>tnmR1</italic>, <italic>tnmR3</italic> and <italic>tnmR7</italic> are highly conserved in all BGCs of AFEs, the deciphered pathway-specific regulatory network of TNMs could be speculated as a common regulatory mechanism for the existed AFEs, which shall provide us new insights to understand and manipulate the biosynthesis of AFEs, and contribute to their future synthetic biology development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p id="Par37"><italic>S.</italic> sp.
