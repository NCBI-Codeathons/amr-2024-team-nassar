Thus, there is an ever-increasing demand for discovery of novel effective antibiotics with new modes of function against resistant pathogens. Endophytic actinobacteria (EA) have currently been considered as one of the most prospective group of microorganisms for discovery of therapeutic agents. This study aimed to isolate EA from <italic>Thymes kotschyanus</italic>, <italic>Allium hooshidaryae</italic>, and <italic>Cerasus microcarpa</italic> plants and to evaluate their antibacterial properties. The healthy samples were collected, dissected and surface-sterilized before cultured on four different selection media at 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Nine EA were isolated and identified based on morphological and molecular properties, and scanning electron micrograph analyses. Based on phylogenetic analysis, they were taxonomically grouped into four families <italic>Streptomycetaceae, Nocardiaceae, Micromonosporaceae</italic>, and <italic>Pseudonocardiaceae</italic>. Their branched aerial mycelia produced chains of cylindrical or cube or oval shaped spores with smooth or rough surfaces. Four strains; IKBG03, IKBG05, IKBG13, and IKBG17 had less than 98.65% sequence similarity to their closely related strains, which constitute them as novel species/strains. Besides, three strains; IKBG05, IKBG13, and IKBG18 were reported as endophytes for the first time. Preliminary antibacterial activity conducted on the all isolates revealed potent antibacterial effects against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. All isolates strongly inhibited the growth of at least one of the tested pathogens. Our results reveals that the test plants are novel sources for isolating a diverse group of rare and common actinobacteria that could produce a wide range of novel biologically active natural products with antibacterial activity which have a great potential in pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biological techniques</kwd><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Microbiology</kwd><kwd>Plant sciences</kwd><kwd>Diseases</kwd><kwd>Medical research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Vice Chancellor for Research and Technology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran</institution></funding-source><award-id>981017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bahrami</surname><given-names>Yadollah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Antibiotics are among the most widely used drugs in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This, in addition to genomic mutations, translocations, and genetic alterations, has led to the development of microbial resistance to existing antibiotics. As a result, millions of people around the world, mostly children and the elderly, die each year due to increased bacterial resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Due to this fact, it is indispensable to discover and develop novel and more powerful bioactive compounds and antibiotics from unexplored environments towards drugs resistant bacteria. Despite the efforts, we are still facing an increasing demand for new effective antibiotics, since microbial warfare seems to be inevitable in the near future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Therefore, scientists have sought to identify and introduce more effective antibiotics over the past three decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In recent years, untapped drug sources have attracted a great deal of attention among researchers. Hence, many methods and technologies have been studied and conducted to discover new drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">One of these attractive sources is microorganisms from unknown environmental origin. Natural products have been used for millennia to treat different infections. They provide us a great opportunity for discovery of therapeutic agents. The natural products of microorganisms are relatively cost-effective, affordable and justified for a variety of economic and non-economic reasons including non-toxic to host and active in low concentration, diversity in their environments, genetic potential, and cheap industrial production. Search for microorganisms in lesser-known environments such as mountainous, marine, and desert environments as well as those which coexist with medicinal plants which have been less studied due to difficulties in sampling, transport, storage, etc., can be a great reservoir for discovery new therapeutic compounds. Within microorganisms, the family of actinomycetes, especially the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, still is the biggest producer of secondary metabolites and bioactive compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, accounting for over 70% of commercially useful antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, many bioactive substances with anti-tumor, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties have been reported from them, which introduces these microorganisms as one of the promising sources for the production of new drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Microbes commonly coexist in diverse communities in nature. Endophytic actinobacteria that coexist with medicinal plants residing within their robust tissues have very beneficial and important effects on the survival and life of their hosts, which are mostly unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Plants harbor novel and diverse range of actinobacteria, and have always been considered as one of the new untapped sources for isolation of EA. Isolation of actinobacteria strains from different environments will probably lead to the identification of new species with high ability to produce bioactive compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the isolation and identification of actinobacteria have recently become a productive area of research that has consequently led to the identification of novel <italic>Actinomycete</italic> species that need to be exploited to unveil possible biosynthetic pathways and discover new bioactive natural metabolites.</p><p id="Par4">Actinobacteria as one of the largest ubiquitous bacterial phylum are generally Gram-positive, having high percentage of G&#x02009;+&#x02009;C bases in their genome, mycelial growth, and spore production. They are widely distributed in both normal and extreme aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Most of them are free-living microorganisms which use the remains of other organisms as saprophytes and also spend most of their lives as spores, especially in harsh environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Actinobacteria are prolific producers of bioactive metabolites with a diverse range of chemically structure complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The actinobacteria phylum currently includes the most prospective group of microorganisms for the discovery of biologically active compounds including peptides, polyketides, macrolides, quinolones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Actinobacteria alone produce approximately two-thirds of all know antibiotics in the market with a diverse range of biological activities namely cytotoxic, antiparasitic, antibacterial, anticancer or antiproliferative, antifungal, antimicrobial, insecticidal and immunosuppressive activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Actinobacteria also play an important role in the recycling and degradation organic substances from dead organisms to a depth of two meters in the soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. They can indirectly inhibit the growth of plant pathogens through biological control or antagonistic activities, especially the production of extracellular enzymes or antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, or produce compounds, which directly promote plant growth and facilitate the absorption of soil nutrients, such as nitrogen fixation, phytohormones and siderophores production, dissolution of soil minerals, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Due to the climatic and geographical diversity of Iran, a broad spectrum of plants and subsequently endophytic microorganisms are available.</p><p id="Par5">Having over 8,000 plants species, the Iranian ecosystem has a very high potential to become a source of unknown endophytic actinobacteria (EA) with unique metabolic profile and properties which can be widely used for discovery and development of new drugs and even genetic engineering of useful strains to improve their properties. To date, however, very little is known about the EA of the native plants in Iran. Therefore, the exploration of potential actinobacteria from untapped habitats is a step-wise approach for discovery of novel antibiotics to meet the current needs to cope with the life-threatening infections. <italic>Allium hooshidaryae, Cerasus microcarpa,</italic> and <italic>Thymes kotschyanus</italic> Boiss &#x00026; Hohen plants have generally been consumed as traditional medicine for many years due to their medicinal properties. Modern pharmacology of <italic>Allium hooshidaryae, Cerasus microcarpa, and Thymes kotschyanus</italic> indicated that the essential oils of these plants have anticancer, anti-anti-inflammatory properties. <italic>Allium hooshidaryae</italic> is a native wild plant in northwestern Iran, traditionally used as folk medicines. However, so far, no study has been published on their microbial diversity and endophytic populations. Therefore, the aims of this study were to isolate and phylogenetically identify EA from abovementioned plants and to evaluate the antibacterial effects of their extracts against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Assessment of surface sterilization</title><p id="Par6">Surface sterilization is a crucial step for the isolation of plant endophytes.

The morphological isolation and purification of colonies were conducted onto ISP2 in order to identify the isolates. ISP2 was also used as a master plate to store colonies for further analyses. The isolates were then characterized based on their molecular properties. Most isolates had different pigmentation as demonstrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The color of colonies varied as summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The strains produced an abundant white to orange yellow, light yellow, pale orange yellow, light orange yellow, greenish white, beige or brownish or light greenish-gray straight aerial mycelia, and appeared in recti flexible, occasionally twisted, which differentiate into straight or spiral spore chains after 10&#x02013;14 days of culture on ISP2 medium (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

This study, for the first time, the plants <italic>Thymes kotschyanus, Allium hooshidaryae</italic>, and <italic>Cerasus microcarpa</italic> were selected to identify the population of EA. A total of nine EA was isolated and identified from different tissues of these plants. Most isolates gave different pigmentation. The well-developed, branched substrate hyphae and aerial mycelia differentiate into straight or spiral spore chains composed of cylindrical or cube or oval spores with smooth or indented or rough surfaces. While <italic>Streptomyces</italic> was the most prevalent genus among isolates and have a cosmopolitan distribution, several isolates that show bioactivity belonged to rare actinomycetes. The data corroborated the results reported by<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> who isolated a number of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> from <italic>Thymus roseus</italic>. Based on 16S rDNA sequence and phylogenetic analyses, the IKBG03, IKBG05 IKBG13, and IKBG17 isolates could be considered as potentially novel species; therefore, more genomic studies and biosynthetic gene clusters analyses of the active strains and polyphasic study into novel strains are needed. </p><p id="Par42">To increase the number of identities, it seems that media with low levels of nutrients are more suitable to isolate actinobacteria and result in the isolation of a large number of actinobacteria or it might use the unculturable methods such as molecular techniques for identification of isolates to increase the number.</p><p id="Par43">All strains exhibited substantial antibacterial effects against at least one of the test pathogens, indicating the potential of these strains to produce secondary metabolites. This study provides a valuable snapshot of the antibacterial potentials of EA from untapped native plants in Iran, having activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on antibacterial property of novel strains from these plants. The IKBG18 and IKBG20 strains showed a potent antibacterial activity. </p><p id="Par44">This research topic expands our knowledge on the actinobacteria- derived bioactive compounds and their biological potential applications. We may need to use different production media to induce silent cluster genes as previous studies highlighted the importance of media for production of bioactive compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Further research is necessary to evaluate the novelty of molecules responsible for the preliminary bioactivity. Further chemical study is also required to purify and elucidate the structure of bioactive compounds from extracts with antibacterial activity in order to develop putative drugs against resistant bacteria. Previous reports have insinuated that the derived actinomycetes bioactive compounds are of alkaloids, macrolides, phenolic, diketopiperazine (DKP), peptides, polyketides, xiamycins, dilactones, salinosporamides, indole alkaloids, 2-pyranones, sesquiterpenes, and phenazines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is vital to perform bioassay-guided fractionation and purification researches on the extracts to explore the structure of pure compounds. Besides, the mechanism of action of bioactive compounds must be scrutinized before they can be used as therapeutic agents. </p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
