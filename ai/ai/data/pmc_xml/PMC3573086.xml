However, whether cytohesins are essential in colorectal cancer is unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether cytohesins contribute to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway in colorectal cancer cells. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence experiments were employed to detect the expression of cytohesins in colorectal cancer cell lines. The EGF pathway activation conditions were investigated by examining the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and intracellular signal-related kinases, with or without chemical inhibition (SecinH3) and knockdown of cytohesins. An MTT assay was conducted to examine the inhibitory effect of SecinH3 and cytohesin-specific siRNA in HT-29 cells. Results demonstrated that the four homologous members of the cytohesin family were expressed in the four colorectal cancer cell lines. Notably, a significantly higher expression level of cytohesin-2 (ARNO) compared with the other three homologous family members was observed. Stimulation with EGF and SecinH3, as well as knockdown of ARNO, are capable of reducing EGF pathway activation and proliferation of HT-29 cells. In conclusion, cytohesins play an essential role in the activation of the EGF pathway and may be a potential target in colorectal cancer therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epidermal growth factor receptor</kwd><kwd>cytohesin</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>pathway</kwd><kwd>ARNO</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer is one of the most common clinical gastrointestinal cancers that poses a serious threat to human health. The GLOBOCAN 2008 estimates stated that colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females, with over 1.2 million new cancer cases and 608,700 fatalities occurring every year (<xref rid="b1-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Effective treatments for colorectal cancer include surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Chemotherapy and targeted therapy are the final strategies implemented to extend patient survival, particularly with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer (<xref rid="b2-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, present evidence-based medicine indicates that colorectal cancer patients hardly benefit from chemotherapy due to chemical toxicity and self-resistance. Therefore, targeted therapy has a greater potential and is currently being investigated further, with a greater research emphasis on cancer therapeutics. Throughout the past decade, targeted treatment of cancer has mainly focused on the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway (<xref rid="b4-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key member of the ErbB family, which consists of four members: EGFR (ErbB1), Her2 (ErbB2), Her3 (ErbB3) and ErbB4. In cancer cells, the extracellular domain of the EGFR binds to the EGF and the EGF pathway is activated; signaling is initiated to regulate the differentiation, survival, proliferation and migration of cancer cells (<xref rid="b6-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, activation of the EGFR is required for signaling initiation; the ligand-induced conformational change in the receptor ectodomains results in the association of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains of two receptor molecules (<xref rid="b7-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The activation of the pathway depends not only on EGF as the ligand binding to the EGFR ectodomains, but also on the activation of homodimerized or heterodimerized cytoplasmic domains of EGFRs (<xref rid="b8-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Bill <italic>et al</italic> have identified cytohesins as conformational activators of the cytoplasmic dimer, which play an important role in lung cancer ErbB signaling (<xref rid="b10-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The cytohesin family includes four highly homologous members: Cytohesin-1, -2 (ARNO), -3 (Grp1) and -4 (<xref rid="b11-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Cytohesins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) that belong to the family of small Ras-like GTPases. As with the case of other small GTPases, ARF function critically depends on activation by GEFs (<xref rid="b12-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, cytohesins are important regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, vesicular traffic and signaling (<xref rid="b10-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Bill <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that cytohesin overexpression increases EGFR activation and signaling. Moreover, siRNA and chemical inhibition of cytohesins produced consistent results both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> in human lung adenocarcinomas. Therefore, the authors concluded that cytohesins were conformational activators of the ErbB receptor in lung cancer (<xref rid="b10-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that EGFR signaling was reduced when cytohesins were inhibited in the HT-29 cell line. Subsequently, whether cytohesins have the potential to act as a target for colorectal cancer therapy was preliminarily investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Cell culture media included RPMI-1640, McCoy&#x02019;s 5A and L-15, which were purchased from Genom (Shanghai, China).

Cytohesin-1, -2 (ARNO), -3 (Grp1) and -4 were transcribed in all four cell lines, which included HT-29, SW620, SW480 and HCT-116. We found that mRNA of the four cytohesins was transcribed in all four cell lines, and ARNO mRNA had the highest expression level (<xref rid="f1-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Additionally, by an immunofluorescence assay, we demonstrated that ARNO was highly expressed in HT-29 cells and was located in the cytoplasm, near to the membrane (<xref rid="f1-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Therefore, the expression of EGFR in colorectal cells was detected by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="f1-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The expression of EGFR in HT-29 cells was higher than that of the other cell lines.

SecinH3 (or a mixture of 100 pmol ARNO siRNA in 5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l Lipofectamine 2000) was added to dishes from group B when cells had spread to cover 70% of the dishes for 10 h.

Western blot analysis was employed to test the expression of the EGF pathway-associated molecules, which included ARNO, EGFR, p-EGFR and p-ERK1/2. The results indicated that when cytohesins were blocked by SecinH3 or inhibited by ARNO siRNA, ARNO expression was reduced in HT-29 cells. Additionally, phosphorylated molecules of the EGF pathway, including p-EGFR and p-ERK1/2, were downregulated in HT-29 cells (<xref rid="f3-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Blocking cytohesins inhibits the proliferation of HT-29 cells</title><p>To detect whether cytohesins are involved in the proliferation of HT-29 cells, we used the specific cytohesin antagonist SecinH3 and the EGFR-expressing human colorectal adenocarcinoma-derived HT-29 cells.

The EGF pathway is considered to be the most prominent signaling pathway in colorectal cancer, as it regulates the differentiation, survival, proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Recently, certain individuals with wild-type Kras gene colorectal cancer have benefited from therapies targeting the EGFR. However, resistance to the EGFR blockade inevitably occurs due to a mutation in the gene encoding EGFR that impairs the binding of cetuximab to EGFR (<xref rid="b15-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to select new targets in this pathway to overcome the resistance acquired due to mutations.</p><p>Recently, Yonesaka <italic>et al</italic> identified acquired resistance to EGFR target therapy via increased signaling through Her2 (ErbB2; also a member of the ErbB family). Notably, the authors demonstrated that either amplification of ErbB2 or increased levels of the ErbB3/ErbB4 ligand heregulin led to <italic>de novo</italic> or acquired cetuximab resistance (<xref rid="b18-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and Ruan <italic>et al</italic> achieved similar results in a breast cancer study (<xref rid="b19-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Cytohesins, family members of GTPases, have been researched for their regulation of the reassembly of the cytoskeleton and the activation of integrin or the integrin signaling system, which is critically associated with cell adhesion and migration (<xref rid="b11-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A further study identified that cytohesins as EGFR activators may form a layer of positive regulation by facilitating the structural rearrangements required to convert the receptor dimer into its active conformation in lung cancer (<xref rid="b10-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Studies by Kolanus (<xref rid="b11-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and Ogasawara <italic>et al</italic>(<xref rid="b22-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) concerning the expression of cytohesins demonstrated that cytohesin-2 (ARNO) and -3 (Grp1) were ubiquitously expressed, whereas cytohesins-1 and -4 were primarily leukocyte-specific. Cytohesin-1 is a key regulator of neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells and to components of the extracellular matrix, which may influence cell emigration through its dual opposing effect on &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 integrin activation (<xref rid="b23-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Additionally, ARNO behaves as a bistable switch, as it has an absolute requirement for activation by an Arf protein but, once triggered, it becomes highly active through the positive feedback effect of Arf1-GTP. This property of ARNO may provide an explanation for its function in signaling pathways that, once triggered, must move forward decisively (<xref rid="b24-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Additionally, in the present study, we detected the presence of cytohesins in the cytoplasm (near the membrane) by immunofluorescence, and ARNO was the most highly expressed cytohesin family member. Therefore, we employed molecular ARNO and the HT-29 cell line as subjects for the other sections of our study. Whether the strong expression of ARNO in colorectal cancer cells, potentially by enhanced EGFR signaling, contributes to tumor differentiation, survival, proliferation and migration, is yet to be determined. However, this has been identified in other types of cancer cells (<xref rid="b25-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-ol-05-02-0521" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>In the cell proliferation section of the present study, HT-29 cells were stimulated by human EGF in the presence of SecinH3 or treated with ARNO siRNA. As a result, both SecinH3- and ARNO siRNA-treated cells demonstrated a 56.77-68.63% inhibition rate compared with solvent-treated samples. Therefore, we hypothesize that inhibiting cytohesins contributed to the reduction in EGFR signaling. To identify the mechanism of this inhibition in HT-29 cells, i.e. whether the enhancement of EGFR activation by cytohesins was due to the effect of cytohesins on EGFR, we investigated the activation of certain EGFR pathway molecules (p-EGFR and p-ERK1/2). Our results gave support to this mechanism of inhibition.</p><p>In conclusion, ARNO, an important isoform of the cytohesin family, is highly expressed in colorectal cancer cells and enhances EGFR signaling, which contributes to tumor differentiation, survival and proliferation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (No. 2012AA02A506), the NSFC (No. 30901741), Zhejiang the Provincial Key Scientific and Technological Research Projects of International Cooperation (No. 2009C14010) and the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. R209.353).
