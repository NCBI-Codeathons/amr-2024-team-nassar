The inhibition of DNA replication often triggers double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) at stalled DNA replication sites, resulting in cytotoxicity. In East Asia, some traditional medicines are administered as anticancer drugs, although the mechanisms underlying their pharmacological effects are not entirely understood. In this study, we screened Japanese herbal medicines and identified two benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs), berberine and coptisine. These alkaloids mildly induced DSBs, and this effect was dependent on the function of topoisomerase I (Topo I) and MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease. Biochemical analysis revealed that the action of BIAs involves inhibiting the catalytic activity of Topo I rather than inducing the accumulation of the Topo I-DNA complex, which is different from the action of camptothecin (CPT). Furthermore, the results showed that BIAs can act as inhibitors of Topo I, even against CPT-resistant mutants, and that the action of these BIAs was independent of CPT. These results suggest that using a combination of BIAs and CPT might increase their efficiency in eliminating cancer cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biochemistry</kwd><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Chemical biology</kwd><kwd>Drug discovery</kwd><kwd>Genetics</kwd><kwd>Molecular biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research for Young Scientists (A),Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)</institution></funding-source><award-id>25710010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanada</surname><given-names>Katsuhiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Grant-in-Aid for the Cooperative Research Project from the Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Japan in 2014</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Natural medicines are commonly used worldwide for the treatment of endocrine and metabolic diseases, infections, and inflammatory symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In Japan, these medications are often combined with Western medicines to induce synergistic effects or mitigate the side effects of Western medicines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Few natural medicines for cancer treatment are well understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, numerous prototype compounds utilized as anticancer agents were discovered from medicinal plants, including camptothecin (CPT), etoposide, taxanes, and vinca alkaloids, and from bacteria, such as mitomycin and anthracyclines. Although these agents act against cancer using a variety of mechanisms, they can be classified into two major groups, namely, DNA replication inhibitors and mitosis inhibitors. DNA replication inhibitors are most frequently used in cancer treatment. CPT inhibits Topo I activity, and etoposide and anthracyclines inhibit topoisomerase II (Topo II) activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Because topoisomerases play a crucial role in DNA replication and chromosome partitioning, the inhibition of their activities results in the formation of DSBs in proliferating cells, which leads to selective cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Mitomycin C tethers both strands of the DNA to yield interstrand DNA crosslinks, which results in the inhibition of DNA replication and DSB formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Mitosis inhibitors have also been discovered in medicinal plants. Taxanes stabilize the microtubule polymer and prevent its disassembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and vinca alkaloids block the polymerization of &#x003b2;-tubulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, treatments using taxanes and vinca alkaloids induce defects in chromosomal segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Among the natural compounds used as anticancer agents, many researchers have actively investigated the mechanism underlying the resistance to CPT. CPT is classified as a monoterpene indole alkaloid and is produced by plants, such as <italic>Camptotheca acuminata</italic>, <italic>Ophiorrhiza pumila</italic>, <italic>Ophiorrhiza liukiuensis</italic>, and <italic>Nothapodytes foetida</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. CPT functions to stabilize the DNA-Topo I complex, which results in the formation of single-strand breaks (SSBs) on the DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The SSB formed by the Topo I-DNA complex might then be converted to a DSB through progression of the DNA replication fork<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The catalytic activity of Topo I is to cleave one of the two strands of double-stranded DNA and relax supercoiled DNA. The OH group of Tyr723 in human Topo I is the active site and cuts the phosphate group at the 3&#x02032;-end of the strand to form a binary DNA-Topo I covalent complex. After cleavage, the broken DNA strand can rotate around the unbroken strand and remove DNA supercoils, and cleaved strand is then rejoined. Thus, Topo I controls the topological state of DNA. Supercoiled DNAs typically appear in front of replication forks during DNA replication, and the dysfunction of Topo I due to treatment causes stalled replication forks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, CPT induces the accumulation of not only DNA replication-mediated DSB formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> but also stalls DNA replication forks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, which results in cytotoxicity in proliferating cells. CPT is toxic to most eukaryotic organisms, such as yeasts, insects, plants, and mammals. Clearly, CPT-producing plants possess defence mechanisms to protect themselves against CPT. Topo I in CPT-producing plants contains specific amino acid substitutions that affect its resistance to CPT, such as N421K, L530I, and/or N722S (numbered according to human Topo I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>). Because these residues are crucial for the interaction between CPT and Topo I, such substitutions lead to defects in this interaction and result in resistance in CPT-producing plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Similarly, CPT-resistant mutations in the <italic>TOP1</italic> gene have also been discovered in human cancer cell lines that were generated as CPT-resistant lines in vitro, namely, R346H and D533G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These residues also play an essential role in the interaction between CPT and Topo I. To date, many other mutations responsible for CPT resistance have been identified in the <italic>TOP1</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Although we only mentioned CPT, cytotoxic substances produced by organisms are usually coupled to defence mechanisms to avoid self-toxicity.</p><p id="Par4">For overcoming drug resistance in cancer cells, it is crucial to identify a compound that acts against drug-resistant cells via a mechanism that differs from that of existing agents and to combine the identified compound with known agents in chemotherapy regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, further screening to discover a variety of substances that inhibit both DNA replication and mitosis via novel mechanisms of action is worthwhile. In this study, we screened herbal extracts used as ingredients in Japanese natural medicines to identify compounds that induce DSBs and, more specifically, to identify DSB formation at DNA replication sites. The screening revealed two candidates, and further characterization of these substances, namely, berberine and coptisine, found that these compounds might act against cancer cells with CPT-resistant <italic>TOP1</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Screening of potential anticancer compounds from Japanese herbal medicines</title><p id="Par5">To discover novel anticancer substances, herbal extracts used in Japanese natural medicines were screened by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. We analysed the appearance of the DNA fragments from 500 kbp to several Mbp as &#x02018;broken DNA&#x02019; (the size marker is shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>b). Under this condition, the DNA fragments from 500 kbp to several Mbp were compacted into one band in the PFGE gel. Detailed protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and the sensitivity of this assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> were previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We believe that many cancer cell lines have their own characteristics. Even the sensitivities of colon cancer cell lines to a particular drug can be quite different. Therefore, we used a neutral cell line rather than a particular type of cancer cell line in our screening. Treatment with two of the 120 herbal extracts (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), namely two extracts prepared from Phellodendron bark (#8) and Coptis rhizome (#10), induced accumulation of DSBs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These findings were confirmed by PFGE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>a). The accumulation of DSBs induced by the treatments with herbal extracts of Phellodendron bark and Coptis rhizome was also confirmed through fluorescence microscopy by visualizing the DSB marker antigens 53BP1 and &#x003b3;-H2AX (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). We therefore analysed the open data in the Traditional Medicine &#x00026; Pharmaceutical Database (TradMPD) published by the Institute of Natural Medicine of Toyama University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dentomed.toyama-wakan.net/en/chemical_analysis_result_of_crude_drug_extracts/">http://dentomed.toyama-wakan.net/en/chemical_analysis_result_of_crude_drug_extracts/</ext-link>). Typical nutrients, such as sugars, including amino saccharides and saccharic acids, fat, including fatty acids and steroids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, were omitted. Although these medicines are prepared from unrelated ingredients (see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), both contain structurally similar BIAs as their major components, namely, berberine, coptisine, and palmatine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). With the aim of understanding the chemical characteristics, these BIAs were analysed to determine whether they were responsible for the formation of DSBs. Cells treated with berberine and coptisine, but not palmatine, showed significant accumulation of DSBs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b,d,e). Because broken DNA contained 5-iodo-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (IdU), BIA-induced DSBs occurred around DNA replication sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d,f). Another type of BIA, magnoflorine, was used as a negative control, and the analysis showed that magnoflorine did not induce DSB formation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d,e, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>b).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Screening of herbal extracts and characterization of berberine and coptisine.

Therefore, we assessed whether combined treatment with aphidicolin could suppress the formation of BIA-induced DSBs. DSBs induced by herbal extracts from Phellodendron bark and Coptis rhizome were suppressed by combined treatment with aphidicolin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>a). Subsequently, the DSBs induced by treatment with berberine and coptisine were examined. Both the induction of DSBs by berberine and coptisine was suppressed by combined treatment with aphidicolin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>b). The DSBs suppressed by combined treatment with aphidicolin contained IdU, which suggests that BIA-induced DSBs primarily occurred at DNA replication sites. To assess whether BIA-induced DSBs were produced as a result of apoptosis, we examined whether BIA-induced DSB formation occurred in the presence of the apoptotic nuclease inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. As expected, BIA-induced DSB formation was not suppressed by combined treatment with Z-VAD-FMK (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>c). These results indicate that the DSBs induced by the aforementioned alkaloids are associated with DNA replication rather than apoptosis. We then followed the time course of BIA-induced DSBs in comparison to those induced by CPT. During treatment with CPT, DSBs started to accumulate after 4&#x000a0;h, and this accumulation continued to increase until 24&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d,e). However, only a slight accumulation of DSBs was observed after 4&#x000a0;h of treatment with berberine and coptisine, but no clear increase was observed from 4 to 24&#x000a0;h. This finding was different from the CPT results. An accumulation of DSBs was hardly observed after treatment with palmatine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d,e, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). To test its cytotoxic effect, we generated dose-dependent cell survival curves (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f,g). MRC5sv cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 24&#x000a0;h, and the medium was then refreshed. Following incubation, survival curves were determined based on the percentages of colony formation. The survival curves suggested that berberine and coptisine showed higher toxicities than palmatine; the lethal dose 50 (LD<sub>50</sub>) for berberine and coptisine was 8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, whereas that for palmatine was 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M. In addition, magnoflorine showed no toxicity until 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). These results are consistent with those from previous studies that assessed the cytotoxic activities of berberine and coptisine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, the cytotoxicities of berberine and coptisine was milder than those of etoposide and CPT, which are used in chemotherapy in the clinic (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f,g).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Analysis of Topo I inhibition by BIAs in vivo.

However, the mechanism through which these BIAs act against Topo I is not yet understood. Therefore, we explored whether the aforementioned alkaloids stabilize the DNA-Topo I complex. The DNA-Topo I complex stabilized during the Topo I reaction was detected as nicked DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL ethidium bromide (EtBr) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>d).

The nicking and rejoining activities on short linear DNAs are less effective due to the inhibitory effect of intercalation. First, the inhibitory effect of nicking activity was explored. Because we cannot use any radioisotopes in our facility at this moment, the Cy-3-labelled substrate was used (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a).

Then one question is how DSB occurs after treatment with berberine and coptisine. Previously, Regairaz et al. showed that the DNA replication fork collapsed by CPT was cleaved by MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonucleases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. One possibility is that stalled replication forks must be induced by inactivation of Topo I function after treatment with these BIAs, and such stalled replication forks are cleaved by MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonucleases. To address this, MUS81 was transiently depleted by siRNA transfection, and the BIA-induced formation of DSBs was analysed by PFGE. First, the depletion of MUS81 protein through the transfection of siRNA against MUS81 was confirmed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>a).

We therefore examined whether these BIAs could inhibit CPT-resistant Topo I proteins in vitro. Recombinant proteins of wild-type Topo I mutations, namely, R364H, D533G, and N722S, were expressed in a baculovirus system and purified (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>a). The activities of the purified wild-type and mutant Topo I proteins were confirmed based on their relaxation activities using commercial untagged Topo I protein (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>b,c). The resistance of the mutant proteins to up to 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CPT was confirmed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). A concentration of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M was the maximum concentration that we could test because a higher concentration resulted in precipitation in the reaction buffer. In the case of wild-type Topo I, treatment with CPT induced nicked DNA by stabilizing the DNA-Topo I complex, and we were able to confirm this activity. Agarose gel electrophoresis without EtBr (-EtBr gel) showed the accumulation of relaxed/nicked DNA, and agarose gel electrophoresis with EtBr revealed the accumulation of nicked DNA in the presence of CPT at a concentration between 6.7 and 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (+&#x02009;EtBr gel) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>a). Treatment with CPT could not induce the accumulation of nicked DNA when the R364H, D533G and N722S mutants were used (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>a). Thereafter, the effects of the selected BIAs on the relaxation activities of CPT-resistant Topo I proteins were examined. As expected, the aforementioned BIAs inhibited CPT-resistant Topo I proteins in a comparable manner to that obtained with the wild-type Topo I protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c&#x02013;e, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>b&#x02013;d). This result suggests that the inhibition of Topo I by the aforementioned BIAs does not require the Arg364, Asp533, and Asn722 residues of Topo I, which indicates that the binding mode of berberine and coptisine that result in Topo I inhibition is different from that of CPT. The interaction modes of these alkaloids with Topo I differ from that of CPT. We then hypothesized that berberine and coptisine will maintain their cytotoxic activity against cells carrying CPT-resistant <italic>Top1</italic> mutations. To assess this hypothesis, we employed two cell lines that carry the D533G and N722S mutations. As previously mentioned, these mutations result in defects in the interaction between CPT and Topo I. We obtained two CPT-resistant cell lines, namely, CPT-K5 carrying the D533G mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and CEM/C2 carrying the N722S mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, as well as their control cell lines, RPMI8204 and CCRF-CEM, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Because these cell lines are suspension-type cells, the survival curves of CPT and the aforementioned alkaloids were determined by MTT assays. First, we confirmed that CPT-K5 and CEM/C2 cells showed resistance to CPT compared with their control cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a,d). The CPT-K5 and CEM/C2 cells were then treated with the indicated BIAs, and their survival curves were determined. Both groups of CPT-resistant cells, namely, CPT-K5 and CEM/C2, were killed by BIAs at a dose comparable to that needed to eliminate their control cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b,c,e,f). These results indicate that the D533G and N722S mutations do not affect the cytotoxic effects of berberine and coptisine, which suggests that berberine and coptisine can remove both CPT-resistant cells and CPT-sensitive cells in a similar manner.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>PFGE analysis of DSB accumulation after treatment with berberine and coptisine in various cancer cell lines.

First, various concentrations of CPT were added in the presence of berberine or coptisine, and the inhibitory effect of Topo I was analysed by a relaxation assay. After treatment with only CPT (Control), all substrate DNAs migrated at the relaxed and nicked DNA positions in the -EtBr gel, but a small amount of unreacted supercoiled appeared in the&#x02009;+&#x02009;EtBr gel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a).

To discover additional substances with anticancer activity, we screened selected Japanese herbal medicines, and treatments with two extracts prepared from Phellodendron bark (#8) and Coptis rhizome (#10) induced accumulations of DSBs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The analysis of available data for natural compounds revealed that berberine and palmatine are major components of these herbal medicines, and we subsequently identified berberine and coptisine. We cannot rule out the possibility that other compounds, including these herbal extracts, might have similar activity, but at least in this study, berberine and coptisine could induce DSBs by inhibiting Topo I function (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The cytotoxic activities of berberine and coptisine have previously been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, but we investigated new aspects of these compounds. First, we found that at least one five-membered ring of coptisine and berberine plays a crucial role in the inhibitory effect of Topo I (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). It is likely that the conformational flexibility of the methoxy groups affects the interaction between BIA and DNA and/or BIA and Topo I. One possibility is that the DNA-binding activities of these alkaloids are involved in Topo I inhibition. In this study, we found that the DNA-binding affinities of berberine, coptisine, and palmatine were similar (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) and not correlated with Topo I inhibition. Previous studies have suggested two distinct DNA interactions of berberine: one is through intercalation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and the other involves what is known as minor groove-directed interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, where the binding occurs on the minor groove of the DNA and in which the convex side is linked to the helix groove. This finding implies that the DNA-binding mode might be involved in Topo I inhibition. However, Pilch et al. showed that not only intercalations but also minor groove-directed interactions were sufficient to inhibit human Topo I activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is unlikely that the DNA-binding mode is correlated with the inhibitory effect of berberine and coptisine on Topo I. Based on the aforementioned evidence, we hypothesized that berberine and coptisine block the catalytic function of Topo I by forming a stable interaction at the active site. Previously, the interaction of berberine, but not coptisine, with Topo I was investigated, and the results indicate that berberine is able to bind to the active site of Topo I, which is the same site to which CPT binds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Berberine and coptisine might stably bind to the active site of Topo I, whereas palmatine could be slightly more unstable due to the movements of methoxy groups. Second, we found that the cytotoxic effects of berberine and coptisine against CPT-resistant cancer cells were comparable to those found with the control (CPT-sensitive) cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The structural comparisons predicted that the binding modes of berberine and coptisine with Topo I were different from that of CPT (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>), and we confirmed this phenomenon using CPT-resistant proteins and cells (Figs. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Based on the results, we identified berberine and coptisine as good candidates for use in combination with CPT to increase the effectiveness of cancer treatment and suppress CPT-resistant cancer cells.</p><p id="Par21">Next, we tried to address the mechanism through which DSB formation occurs after treatment with berberine and coptisine, but we could not fully understand its mechanism. This certainly requires further investigation. First, we examined whether BIA-induced DSB formation was suppressed by cotreatment with aphidicolin. Previous studies have suggested that aphidicolin acts as an antagonist of CPT-induced DSB formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> but not etoposide-induced DSB formation because etoposide has not only S phase-dependent toxicity but also S phase-independent toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. BIA-induced DSB formation was largely suppressed by cotreatment with aphidicolin, and BIA-induced DSB formation associated with DNA replication occurred. Next, we accessed if SSB formed by the Topo I-DNA complex might be converted to a DSB through progression of the DNA replication fork or not. However, we could not detect the effect of berberine and coptisine in stabilizing the Topo I-DNA complex (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b,d, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that an SSB formed by the Topo I-DNA complex might be converted to a DSB through progression of the DNA replication fork. Third, we explored the possibility that treatment with berberine and coptisine causes stalled DNA replication forks by inhibiting Topo I, and stalled DNA replication forks were cleaved by MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease, resulting in the formation of DSBs at DNA replication sites. Indeed, it is shown that the dysfunction of Topo I due to treatment causes stalled replication forks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and the DNA replication fork collapsed by CPT was cleaved by MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonucleases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Here we showed that BIA-induced DSB formation was dependent on the MUS81 function (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that some stalled replication forks might be cleaved by a MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease, which results in the formation of DSBs. Forth, we also detected that cells depleting Topo I by siRNA did not show DSB formation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Since Topo I is essential for DNA replication, the cell without Topo I cannot initiate DNA replication, whose situation is the similar to that treated with aphidicolin. It is likely that Topo I-depletion reduced the number of active DNA replication forks, and this automatically results in the reduction of stalled DNA replication forks by treatment with these BIAs. Thus, cells depleting Topo I by siRNA did not show DSB formation. Based on&#x000a0;these, we suggest that stalled replication forks induced by inactivation of Topo I function after treatment with berberine and coptisine must be cleaved by MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonucleases.</p><p id="Par22">One concern regarding the use of berberine and coptisine in clinical settings is that their cytotoxicity is not sufficiently strong for the compounds to be considered efficient anticancer treatments. An anticancer drug used in chemotherapy has an LD<sub>50</sub> lower than 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M. Therefore, modifying the chemical structure of berberine and coptisine to increase their cytotoxicity is certainly needed. Moreover, we cannot deny the possibility that berberine and coptisine have another target molecule that causes cytotoxicity. Understanding the mechanisms of these alkaloid actions will certainly increase the knowledgebase of the chemical biology field as well as possibly inform improvements in chemotherapy regimens.</p><p id="Par23">Natural medicines prepared using Phellodendron bark and Coptis rhizome are generally administered as gastrointestinal and anti-inflammatory agents. Currently, berberine chloride is an authorized antibacterial drug in Japan used in the treatment of diarrhoea. In contrast, a major side effect of CPT is severe diarrhoea. In Japan and China, natural medicines, such as Hange-shashin-to, Sairei-to, Shengjiang Xiexin decoction, Banxia Xiexin decoction, Huangqin decoction, and PHY906, have been found to be effective in preventing CPT-induced diarrhoea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Interestingly, Coptis rhizome is a common ingredient in all of these medicines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Although the involvement of berberine and coptisine in the suppression of CPT-induced diarrhoea has never been examined, identifying substances that can suppress CPT-induced diarrhoea is certainly important. Overall, a screening of Japanese herbal medicines successfully identified berberine and coptisine as DSB inducers at DNA replication sites, and we found that berberine and coptisine inhibit Topo I, even in CPT-resistant cells, and thereby induce cell death. Natural product screening might be regarded as an obsolete technology; however, there remain many undiscovered substances that might exhibit great potential in healthcare as well as academic research in medicine, chemistry, and biology, particularly with regard to improving chemotherapy regimens and understanding the underlying pharmacological actions of these natural medicines. Acquiring knowledge from nature might be considered old-fashioned but could also lead to a novel discovery.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cell lines and media</title><p id="Par24">All human cells were cultivated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
