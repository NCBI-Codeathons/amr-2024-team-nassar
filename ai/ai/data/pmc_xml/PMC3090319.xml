It is known for its adaptability to diverse environments. It can cope with stress factors and acquire resistances to antibiotics thus rendering treatment difficult. <italic>S. aureus </italic>can cause a wide range of infections, mainly due to an impressive arsenal of virulence determinants comprising cell surface components and excreted factors interacting with the host system. Transport of proteins to the cell surface and secretion to the extracellular space is mediated through different transport systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] of which the general protein secretion system Sec plays a prominent role in protein export and membrane insertion.</p><p>Sec-mediated translocation has best been studied in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and is catalyzed by the essential SecYEG protein complex (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). The motor ATPase SecA or a translating ribosome is believed to promote protein export by driving the substrate in an unfolded conformation through the SecYEG channel. The accessory SecDF-YajC complex facilitates protein export and membrane protein insertion efficiency in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], possibly via the control of SecA cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The large exoplasmic loops of the integral membrane proteins SecD and SecF have been shown to be required for increasing protein translocation by a yet unknown mode of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. While <italic>secDF </italic>disruption leads to a cold-sensitive phenotype and defects in protein translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the absence of YajC, which interacts with SecDF, causes only a weak phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. SecYEG has been shown to interact with the SecDF-YajC complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. YidC, a protein that is proposed to mediate membrane integration and the assembly of multimeric complexes, can also interact with SecDF-YajC to take over SecYEG-dependent membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Data on the <italic>S. aureus </italic>Sec system is scarce: SecA and SecY have been shown to be important, respectively essential, for growth by using antisense RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Deletion of <italic>secG </italic>resulted in an altered composition of the extracellular proteome, which was aggravated in a <italic>secG secY2 </italic>double mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Deletion of <italic>secY2 </italic>alone, which together with <italic>secA2 </italic>belongs to the accessory Sec system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], did not show any effect on protein translocation. As in the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, in <italic>S. aureus </italic>the accessory SecD and SecF proteins are fused to form a single protein (Sa1463), which was identified in membrane vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the chromosomal organization in <italic>S. aureus </italic>resembles the one of <italic>E. coli</italic>, with <italic>yajC </italic>lying immediately upstream of <italic>secDF</italic>. Furthermore, SecDF was identified in a surface-exposed peptide epitope screen by using a cell shaving technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and expression was found to be slightly higher in a COL <italic>sigB </italic>deletion mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. SecDF is postulated to be essential in <italic>S. aureus </italic>according to a mutagenic screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>SecDF belongs to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family of multidrug export pumps, that is conserved and widely distributed in all three major kingdoms of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. RND proteins have a wide substrate specificity and diverse functions ranging from the efflux of noxious host derived substances, such as bile salts by <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] to the involvement of eukaryotic efflux pumps in cholesterol homeostasis in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Multiple antibiotic resistance can be associated with these exporters, as they often recognize a broad range of substrates, thereby diminishing drug accumulation in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. <italic>S. aureus </italic>possesses two additional uncharacterized RND proteins, namely Sa2056, located downstream of the essential <italic>femX </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and Sa2339 (MmpL homologue).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Construction of the <italic>rnd </italic>mutants</title><p>To evaluate the role and impact of the RND proteins in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, markerless deletion mutants were constructed in the sequenced and well-characterized clinical strain Newman. SecDF, Sa2056 and Sa2339 were found to be dispensable, as we obtained null mutants by allelic replacement of the corresponding genes using the pKOR1 system of Bae et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The mutants were confirmed to have generally retained genome stability and to carry the desired modification in the corresponding locus as described in methods.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>sa2056 </italic>and <italic>sa2339 </italic>had no apparent effect on <italic>S. aureus </italic>when evaluating growth and resistance properties (data not shown), suggesting that they may be important under other conditions than applied in this study. The following report is therefore focused on the <italic>secDF </italic>mutant and its phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription of <italic>secDF </italic>and growth phenotype of the <italic>secDF </italic>mutant</title><p>Transcription of <italic>secDF </italic>was monitored from early exponential to early stationary phase and found to result mainly in a monocistronic mRNA. <italic>secDF </italic>was strongest transcribed during early growth phase and declined towards stationary phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). As expected, no transcripts were detected in the <italic>secDF </italic>deletion mutant.

These findings were in contrast to the observed higher hemolytic activities and SpA amounts in the supernatant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> respectively 7), which either suggests increased stability or reduced degradation of these proteins in the <italic>secDF </italic>mutant.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Transcription of virulence factors</bold>. <italic>atl</italic>, <italic>coa</italic>, <italic>hla</italic>, <italic>spa </italic>and <italic>hld </italic>transcription was monitored over growth in strains Newman and &#x00394;<italic>secDF</italic>.

Yet the impact of the RND family of efflux pumps in staphylococcal resistance and fitness is still open (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]). To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate their role in <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p><p>We found SecDF to contribute probably in part indirectly to resistance against several substances, including &#x003b2;-lactams and glycopeptides, making it an interesting target for increasing the efficacy of these standard antibiotics. In contrast Sa2056 and Sa2339 seemed not to be required for growth and resistance under the conditions tested. Banerjee et al. recently had found a conservative amino acid mutation in Sa2056 in a high-level &#x003b2;-lactam resistant <italic>mecA</italic>-negative strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However in that strain PBP4 and Sa0013 were also mutated and the exact reason for the observed resistance phenotype was not identified.</p><p>Resistance against cell wall active antibiotics and cell separation is dependent on a tightly balanced regulation of cell wall synthetic and hydrolytic enzymes, including their timely localization to the septum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The amount of PBPs 1-4 and PBP2a was apparently not influenced, suggesting that other factors important for cell division and &#x003b2;-lactam resistance were affected. The increased hydrolytic activity in the <italic>secDF </italic>mutant may explain the observed differences in cell wall production and separation. Overproduction of a hydrolase has been observed to affect formation of the FtsZ-ring in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. This cytoskeleton structure recruits the other cell division proteins to the site of future cell separation. A similar indirect effect in the <italic>secDF </italic>mutant might have lead to an incorrect localization of the cell division machinery, including PBPs (for a general review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]), thereby causing reduced resistance against the cell wall active antibiotics oxacillin and vancomycin. The difference in Atl processing might have impeded proper cell separation in addition.</p><p>Like <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>B. subtilis secDF </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], the <italic>S. aureus secDF </italic>mutant displayed a cold-sensitive phenotype. In <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>B. subtilis </italic>SecDF has furthermore been shown to participate in membrane integration and secretion of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In <italic>S. aureus </italic>many physiological functions were affected by the <italic>secDF </italic>deletion. Analysis of the secretion of classical <italic>S. aureus </italic>virulence factors containing a Sec-type signal peptide revealed a complex picture. Coagulase and proteases were reduced in the supernatant in the <italic>secDF </italic>mutant. However, hemolysin activity under planktonic growth conditions was increased in the mutant, as was the case for (unprocessed) hydrolases, indicating that the <italic>secDF </italic>deletion did not lead to an overall reduction, but to an altered secretion and processing of proteins. In contrast hemolysin activity was reduced during sessile growth indicating that the deletion of <italic>secDF </italic>may have effects on overall metabolism.</p><p>SpA seemed to be impaired in reaching its destined subcellular localization. In the <italic>secDF </italic>mutant SpA accumulated in the membrane, was reduced in the cell wall fraction but was found in increased amounts in the supernatant. Altered secretion and processing of SpA might be due to impaired cell wall anchoring by the membrane protein sortase. However, Mazmanian et al. have shown that the extracellular enterotoxin B fused to the sorting signal of SpA accumulates in the cytoplasm and to a lesser extent in the membrane in a sortase mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Thus, SpA might migrate by an alternate mechanism into the supernatant, circumventing linking to the peptidoglycan.</p><p>A similar divergent effect on protein secretion as we observed in the <italic>secDF </italic>mutant was found in a <italic>secG </italic>mutant. There SpA was found in increased amounts in the exoproteome, despite unaffected transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, we found deletion of <italic>secDF </italic>to change mRNA levels for many of the analyzed genes, such as <italic>atl</italic>, <italic>coa</italic>, <italic>hla</italic>, <italic>hld </italic>and <italic>spa</italic>. The lack of <italic>secDF </italic>therefore seems to have a different impact on virulence factor expression than <italic>secG</italic>, influencing, most likely indirectly, transcription in addition to translocation. The absence of SecDF could especially cause a defective or reduced membrane insertion of sensor proteins belonging to one of the numerous <italic>S. aureus </italic>two component systems contributing to virulence factor regulation and to adaptations to different growth conditions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]). The reduced <italic>hld </italic>levels in the mutant suggests that the <italic>secDF </italic>deletion affected at least one two component system by impairing signaling via the <italic>agr </italic>quorum sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>This study and the work of Sibbald et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] once more demonstrate that protein and mRNA levels do not necessarily correlate. Specific regulation at the protein level has been shown for certain transcription factors in <italic>S. aureus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Such a control of protein stability via chaperones and proteases might exist as well for virulence factors. Interestingly, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>secY</italic>, <italic>yidC </italic>and <italic>secD </italic>mutants were shown to induce the Cpx system, which up-regulates the expression of factors involved in folding and proteolysis in response to abnormal proteins in the outer membrane, the periplasmic space or the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The induction of similar systems in the <italic>S. aureus secDF </italic>mutant due to clogging of the membrane, as suggested by the increased amounts of SpA in this compartment, could be an additional factor influencing protein stability and lead to the partially incoherent mRNA and protein levels, as seen for <italic>hla</italic>, <italic>hld </italic>and <italic>spa </italic>during planktonic growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This work provides evidence that although <italic>secDF </italic>is dispensable in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, its deletion leads to a pleiotropic phenotype. Lack of SecDF affected cell separation, resistance and virulence factor expression showing that this conserved RND protein plays a major role in the important human pathogen <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Thus SecDF could be a potential therapeutic target rendering <italic>S. aureus </italic>more susceptible to the currently available antibiotics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

PBP2a was detected as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. For detection of PBP4, membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS. Membranes were pre-incubated with 40 &#x003bc;g/ml human IgG in 0.5% milk powder/PBS. Rabbit anti-PBP4 antibodies (1:2000, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]) and 0.05% Tween 20 were then added. After incubation for 1 h, membranes were washed three times with PBS before addition of goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:10'000 in 0.5% milk powder/PBS/0.05% Tween 20. After washing three times with PBS, HRP was detected as described for SpA. Molecular weights of PBP2a, PBP4 and unprocessed SpA are 76 kDa, 48 kDa and 56.7 kDa, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Bocillin-FL staining</title><p>Hundert &#x003bc;g of cell membrane fraction were incubated for 30 min at 35&#x000b0;C with Bocillin-FL (Invitrogen) as described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] before separation by SDS-7.5% PAGE.
