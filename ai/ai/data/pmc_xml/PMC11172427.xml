In this study, metabolomics analysis was performed on two groups of rice (T1, with insect pests; T2, without pests), indicating that fatty acids, alkaloids, and phenolic acids were significantly up-regulated in T1. The up-regulated metabolites (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.1) were enriched in linoleic acid metabolism, terpene, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, &#x003b1;-linolenic acid metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. Six significantly up-regulated differential metabolites in T1 were screened out: <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-<italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-feruloyl-3-methoxytyramine (<bold>1</bold>), <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-<italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-feruloyltyramine (<bold>2</bold>), N-<italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-coumaroyltyramine (<bold>3</bold>), <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-<italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-feruloyltyramine (<bold>4</bold>), <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine (<bold>5</bold>), and benzamide (<bold>6</bold>). The insect growth inhibitory activities of these six different metabolites were determined, and the results show that compound <bold>1</bold> had the highest activity, which significantly inhibited the growth of <italic toggle="yes">Chilo suppressalis</italic> by 59.63%. Compounds <bold>2</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> also showed a good inhibitory effect on the growth of <italic toggle="yes">Chilo suppressalis</italic>, while the other compounds had no significant effect. RNA-seq analyses showed that larval exposure to compound <bold>1</bold> up-regulated the genes that were significantly enriched in ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, the cell cycle, ribosomes, and other pathways. The down-regulated genes were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and other pathways. Eighteen up-regulated genes and fifteen down-regulated genes from the above significantly enriched pathways were screened out and verified by real-time quantitative PCR. The activities of detoxification enzymes (glutathione S-transferase (GST); UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT); and carboxylesterase (CarE)) under larval exposure to compound <bold>1</bold> were measured, which indicated that the activity of GST was significantly inhibited by compound <bold>1</bold>, while the activities of the UGT and CarE enzymes did not significantly change. As determined by UPLC-MS, the contents of compound <bold>1</bold> in the T1 and T2 groups were 8.55 ng/g and 0.53 ng/g, respectively, which indicated that pest insects significantly induced the synthesis of compound <bold>1</bold>. Compound <bold>1</bold> may enhance rice insect resistance by inhibiting the detoxification enzyme activity and metabolism of <italic toggle="yes">Chilo suppressalis</italic>, as well as promoting cell proliferation to affect its normal growth and development process. The chemical&#x02013;ecological mechanism of the insect resistance of rice is preliminarily clarified in this paper.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Oryza sativa</italic></kwd><kwd>anti-herbivore</kwd><kwd>induce</kwd><kwd>anti-insect activity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>31800332</award-id><award-id>32371588</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Distinguished Youth Talent Program of the Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University</funding-source><award-id>XJQ201922</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province</funding-source><award-id>2021J01095</award-id><award-id>2021J01075</award-id><award-id>2022J01591</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University</funding-source><award-id>GBMUC-2019-007</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31800332; 32371588), the Distinguished Youth Talent Program of the Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (XJQ201922), the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2021J01095, 2021J01075, and 2022J01591), and the Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (GBMUC-2019-007).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-25-05946"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Due to their sequestered growth, plants develop a range of defenses when being eaten by insects, including constitutive and induced defenses. The induced defense of plants can only be manifested in the presence of exogenous stimuli. For example, plants can produce various induced defense responses after being infested by phytophagous insects and then develop insect resistance through changes in physiology, biochemistry, and morphological characteristics [<xref rid="B1-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The induced defense of plants against insects is mainly dependent on the secondary metabolites of plants. Secondary metabolites are the main chemical weapons of plants&#x02019; defense that are formed by plants through physiological and biochemical mechanisms in the long-term evolutionary process to cope with a variety of environmental stresses, constituting an important part of the plants&#x02019; defense and anti-stress systems [<xref rid="B2-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A variety of toxic secondary metabolites, such as steroidal compounds, terpenes, phenols, indoles, and nitrogenous chemicals are produced when plants are subjected to insect pests. These substances can resist, avoid, poison, hinder the growth and development of insects, or attract natural enemies [<xref rid="B3-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Insects may show a significant decrease in their pupation rate and survival rate, as well as a decrease in food intake when they are directly exposed to or fed with secondary metabolites having anthelmintic activity. These defensive secondary metabolites are normally present at relatively low levels in plants and are not essential, but they are important for plants&#x02019; role in resisting environmental stresses and responding to external stimuli, especially against insect damage [<xref rid="B5-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, benzoxazinoids (BXs) are important defensive secondary metabolites in plants that are both anti-insect and anti-disease, and the BXs glucosides in the vesicles are interpreted hydrologically to release toxic glycosidic ligands for defense against insects when plants are eaten by herbivorous insects [<xref rid="B6-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The concentration of the toxin mexofuranoside is very low in <italic toggle="yes">Pastinaca sativa</italic> roots and rapidly rises when the plants are damaged [<xref rid="B7-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. When <italic toggle="yes">Spodoptera litura</italic> feeds on tobacco leaves (<italic toggle="yes">Nicotiana tabacum</italic>), the nicotine content in the leaves increases for defensive purposes [<xref rid="B8-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in wild-type <italic toggle="yes">Sorghum bicolor</italic> (L.) Moench significantly increased the mortality of maize aphids (<italic toggle="yes">Rhopalosiphum maidis</italic> Fitch) compared with ineffective mutants lacking them. The content of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increases when <italic toggle="yes">Choristoneura rosaceana</italic> crawls on soybean leaves, which inhibits the neurotransmission of herbivorous insects, reduces their development rate, and promotes their death [<xref rid="B10-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Insects can feed on solid plants by stinging or chewing, and the plants activate their own defense mechanism under the action of inducing factors in the insects&#x02019; saliva, producing changes in proteins and enzymes and ultimately inducing the synthesis of defensive secondary metabolites in the metabolic network of the energy and materials in the plants in response to biotic stresses [<xref rid="B1-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible to study the chemical composition of plants after feeding by insects and to explore the basis of substances with anti-insect activity.</p><p>Rice (<italic toggle="yes">Oryza sative</italic> L.) is an important food crop and is cultivated over a huge area across the world [<xref rid="B11-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Insect pests are one of the main causes of rice yield reduction, and the economic losses caused by insect pests in the world are close to USD 10 billion every year [<xref rid="B12-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The use of chemical pesticides poses a potential threat to food safety and destabilizes agroecosystems [<xref rid="B13-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, the use of rice resistance is an important method of modern crop pest control.</p><p>When rice is eaten by herbivorous insects, it is induced to produce and accumulate a large number of targeted defensive substances, which affect a series of physiological and biochemical processes, such as molting, reproduction, metabolism, and energy conversion, in the insects [<xref rid="B14-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The secondary metabolites produced by pest stress can be transferred from affected parts to the whole rice plant, and most of these metabolites play a regulatory role in the growth and development of herbivorous insects [<xref rid="B15-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Tryptamine levels in rice leaves were 12 times higher than those in the control group when eaten by <italic toggle="yes">Chilo suppressalis</italic>, and the receptivity of leaf tissue to larvae was negatively correlated with the level of tryptamine on the leaf surface [<xref rid="B16-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The secondary metabolite tryptamine is involved in plant defense. In addition, 2 terpenoids and 11 unknown compounds were identified in rice stressed by brown plant hopper, rice leaf roller, and <italic toggle="yes">Chilo suppressalis</italic> [<xref rid="B18-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. But, so far, the material basis for insect resistance activity in rice remains unexplained.</p><p>In this paper, we analyzed two different treatments of rice (insect-infested (T1) and non-infested (T2)) by metabolomics, screened out unique metabolites in T1, and evaluated the insect-resistant activities of different metabolites. An analytical method was established for the determination of anti-insect active substances, and their contents were found in T1 and T2. Detoxification enzyme activity and transcriptome sequencing were performed to reveal the anti-insect mechanisms of these substances. The results of this study could elucidate the chemical&#x02013;ecological mechanisms of insect resistance in rice, promote the sustainable development of agriculture, and guarantee food security.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-25-05946"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-25-05946"><title>2.1. Results of Metabolites</title><p>Metabolomics tests were performed on T1 and T2, and the quality control results showed that the proportion of substances with CV values of less than 0.5 in the T1 and T2 samples was higher than 85% (<xref rid="ijms-25-05946-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A), indicating that the overall experimental data were stable. Repeated correlation assessment (<xref rid="ijms-25-05946-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B) showed good reproducibility within the sample group and large differences between the groups. The PCA score plots of the T1 and T2 samples (<xref rid="ijms-25-05946-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C) showed that the cumulative interpretation rate of the first two principal components was 75.3%. PC1 (61.3%) and PC2 (14%) could basically reflect the main characteristic information of all samples.

As shown in the volcano plot (<xref rid="ijms-25-05946-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), 398 differential metabolites were obtained. Compared with the T2 group, 354 metabolites in T1 were significantly up-regulated, 44 compounds were significantly down-regulated, and the overall metabolite content showed an up-regulated trend. The cluster analysis of differential metabolites (<xref rid="ijms-25-05946-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) showed that lipids (28.64%), alkaloids (13.57%), and phenolic acids (17.84%) accounted for a large proportion of the differential metabolites. The content of flavonoids was mostly down-regulated, and a small part was up-regulated. Amino acids and their derivatives, organic acids, nucleotides and their derivatives, lignans, coumarins, and terpenes, with relatively low proportions, were mostly up-regulated.</p><p>The KEGG enrichment diagram (<xref rid="ijms-25-05946-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) shows that 398 different metabolites were enriched in 79 metabolic pathways, and the enrichment degree was greater when the Rich factor was higher, and the lower the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value, the more significant the enrichment. Among them, 14 metabolic pathways were highly enriched (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.5). These included linoleic acid metabolism, terpene, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, &#x003b1;-linolenic acid metabolism, and so on. Among them, the top 20 metabolic pathways with the highest abundance tended toward a score of 1 in combination with the analysis of the differential abundance score (<xref rid="ijms-25-05946-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B), indicating that the expressions of differential metabolites in T1 show an overall up-regulated trend compared with T2 (the more the DA score tends to be 1, the more the overall expression of the pathway tends to be up-regulated; the more it moves to &#x02212;1, the lower it is). It was found that metabolic pathways with significantly up-regulated metabolites (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.1) were linoleic acid metabolism, terpene, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, &#x003b1;-linolenic acid metabolism, lysine degradation, tryptophan metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism, which may be important metabolic pathways for insect resistance in rice.</p><p>After feeding, 71 kinds of alkaloid metabolites in rice were significantly changed (<xref rid="ijms-25-05946-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), among which 70 metabolites were up-regulated and 1 metabolite was down-regulated. Phenolamines were the most abundant among them including 29 kinds, which suggests that phenolamines may be involved in the resistance of rice to these insects.

In the significantly up-regulated genes (<xref rid="ijms-25-05946-f014" ref-type="fig">Figure 14</xref>A), only REXO1 and MCM3 could be detected in the CK group, while the other target genes were only detected in the RT group, and these genes were significantly up-regulated in the RT group.

Discussion</title><p>The research on rice resistance has been ongoing for a long time, and the research on rice resistance to insects has been a research hotspot recently [<xref rid="B19-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The mechanism of rice resistance to insects is mostly explained at the molecular level, and a number of insect resistance genes have been obtained from rice, but the chemical basis of insect resistance in rice has still not been clearly explained, resulting in the functions of many resistance genes not being verified [<xref rid="B21-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, the metabolomics analysis of the T1 and T2 groups showed that the metabolic pathways with significantly up-regulated metabolites (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.1) were linoleic acid metabolism, terpene, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, &#x003b1;-linolenic acid metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. Studies have shown that the accumulation of plant fatty acids and their derivatives can effectively improve plant insect resistance, and especially the content of fatty acids with C18 chains can affect the signaling pathway mediated by salicylic acid and improve plant resistance to insect pests [<xref rid="B24-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Fifteen fatty acids with C18 chains were enriched in the linoleic acid metabolic pathway and were all up-regulated, suggesting that there might be similar mechanisms of insect resistance in rice. The &#x003b1;-linolenic acid metabolic pathway was enriched with nine metabolites: jasmonic acid, 13S-hydroxy-9Z,11E,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid, 9-hydroxy-12-oxo-15(Z)-octadecenoic acid, 13(s)-hydroperoxy-(9z,11e,15z)-octadecatrienoic acid, methyl jasmonate, 9-hydroxy-10,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, 2R-hydroxy-9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid, 17-hydroxylinolenic acid, 9-hydroxy-12-oxo-10(E), and 15(Z)-octadecadienoic acid. The contents of these metabolites were significantly increased in group T1. The increased contents of jasmonic acid and its derivative methyl jasmonate indicated that the signal transduction pathway of JA synthesis was activated [<xref rid="B26-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and JA was the main defense hormone to activate plant resistance to herbivorous insects, suggesting that JA is also involved in regulating rice resistance to insects. Studies [<xref rid="B27-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have shown that the pathway of tryptophan metabolism can affect the defense response of rice against brown planthoppers. In this pathway, the OsTrp1 gene negatively regulates the salicylic acid (SA) pathway of rice. Deletion of the OsTrp1 gene reduces the survival rate of nymphs and improves insect resistance.</p><p>The contents of alkaloids in rice induced by insect infestation were significantly up-regulated. Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing organic compounds that do not play a major role in plant growth and development, but many are toxic to herbivores. Alkaloids can produce deterring, toxic, and anti-feeding effects on herbivorous insects; change the physiological and biochemical processes in insects; and inhibit or disturb their metabolism, growth, and development [<xref rid="B28-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Alkaloids can inhibit the synthetic repair of DNA as well as transcription and translation processes; can inhibit the biosynthesis of resistant proteins in insects, causing toxicity to them; and can also affect insects&#x02019; nervous systems from the receptors to the neurotransmitters [<xref rid="B28-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Phenolamine compounds <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold>, belonging to alkaloids, had significant anti-insect activity, which indicates that phenolamines have antifeedant or gastrotoxic activity against the insect. The anti-insect activity decreased from compounds <bold>1</bold> to <bold>4</bold> at the same concentration. Regarding their structures, the double bond in compounds <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>3</bold> is <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>, while in compound <bold>4</bold>, it is <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>, which suggests that the anti-insect activity of trans double bonds is better. Previous studies have shown that exogenous stress and insect harm can induce the synthesis of phenolamines. The exogenous application of 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid can induce a chemical defense to protect rice plants from white-backed planthoppers. Meanwhile, 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid increases the levels of phenolamines and flavonoids [<xref rid="B30-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The contents of phenolamines and phenolic acids in rice increased when the rice was damaged by brown planthoppers [<xref rid="B31-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The content of phenolamines in compound <bold>1</bold> increased by eight times when the rice was infested by pests.</p><p>The results of the detoxification enzyme activity related to insect metabolic resistance show that compound <bold>1</bold> had no significant effect on CarE and UGT activities but significantly inhibited GST activity, which was 0.59 times higher in the treatment group than in the control group. Studies have shown that GST is mainly involved in the second stage of pesticide metabolism, which can transport and dissolve the hydrolyzed products after a series of biochemical reactions in the first stage and catalyze the combination of reduced glutathione (GSH) with electrophilic toxic substances, increasing its water solubility, which is conducive to excretion. Because it also has peroxidase activity, it can play an important role in preventing oxidative stress caused by the ingestion of toxic substances [<xref rid="B32-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. By genome and transcriptome sequencing, 23 CsGSTs genes were identified in abamectin-treated <italic toggle="yes">Chilo suppressalis</italic>, and when the GSTs were inhibited, the susceptibility of the larvae to abamectin was increased, and the survival rate of the larvae was decreased [<xref rid="B33-ijms-25-05946" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Compound <bold>1</bold> may reduce the detoxification ability and inhibit larval weight gain by negatively regulating GSTs in a similar manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-ijms-25-05946"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>When infested by pests, rice resists insects by immediately up-regulating fatty acids, alkaloids, and phenolic acids. These metabolites were enriched into the pathways of linoleic acid metabolism, terpene, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, &#x003b1;-linolenic acid metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism.
