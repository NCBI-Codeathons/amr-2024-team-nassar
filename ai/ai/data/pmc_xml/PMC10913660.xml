Ad libitum feeding strategies and low levels of management contribute to residual and wasted feed for lactating sows, which provides a source of nutrients and microbial source for houseflies in warm climates. Due to the absence of the all-in/all-out system, the coexistence of sows of two production stages including gestating and lactating sows in the farrowing barn may have potential negative impacts. In this research, we evaluated the effects of lactating sow leftover on the environmental microbiota of the farrowing barn and the contribution of microbial environments to the gestating sow fecal bacterial structure with a 30-day-long treatment of timely removing lactating residual feed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Houseflies in the farrowing barn mediate the transmission of microorganisms from lactating sow leftover to multiple regions. <italic>Leuconostoc</italic>, <italic>Weissella</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Pediococcus</italic> from the leftover which can produce exopolysaccharides, are more capable of environmental transmission than pathogenic microorganisms including <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and utilize houseflies to achieve spread in environmental regions of the farrowing barn.

Efficient nutritional formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], feeding and management strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] can reduce production costs and limit the spread of pathogenic microorganisms, including the all-in/all-out (AIAO) system. The AIAO system means there is only one stage of production and health state of livestock animals in each barn. However, the AIAO system has not yet been implemented in some developing country farms due to cost constraints including space and equipment.</p><p id="Par5">Primiparous and multiparous sows are housed in the breeding barn or farrowing barn based on their gestational age. Farms that do not strictly implement an AIAO systems often confront with the situation where lactating sows and gestating sows are housed together in the same farrowing barn. Meanwhile, in order to increase the productivity of sows during gestation, restricted feeding during gestation and ad libitum feeding after farrowing are often adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which upregulates the complexity of management in mix-feeding farrowing barns and also results in the residual of leftover feed for lactating sows. When the temperature becomes warm, feed residual may become a source of nutrients for arthropods while simultaneously serving as a colony for microorganisms.</p><p id="Par6">Houseflies (<italic>Musca domestica</italic> L.) are common arthropods found on farms whose life expectancy and reproductive capacity are closely associated with their compatible breeding regional choices, including the availability of excrement, decaying organic matter and waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which are conditions available in livestock farms. Meanwhile, warm climates can shorten the egg stage of housefly to 7&#x02013;10 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], causing the proliferation of houseflies. Houseflies can transmit microorganisms by physical contact and have been demonstrated to mediate seasonal transmission of pathogens such as <italic>Shigella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] in areas of human activity, as well as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], multidrug-resistant <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] in swine farms.

The experiment was carried out in summer, when the average daytime temperature exceeded 30&#x02103;. We chose the breeding barn and farrowing barn as the experimental areas for this research, where only gestating sows were present in the breeding barn (BB) and both gestating and lactating sows were present in the farrowing barn (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). At the beginning of the experiment, we randomly selected 30 primiparous crossbred gestating sows of the same breed: 20 gestating sows more than 31 days and 10 gestating sows more than 61 days before the farrowing due date (FDD) in the BB. All experimental gestating sows (inseminated at body weight&#x02009;=&#x02009;125&#x000a0;kg&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.5&#x000a0;kg) lived in the BB from insemination to 31 days before the FDD. At 31 days before FDD, 10 of the first 20 gestating sows were retained in the BB and the remaining 10 gestating sows were transferred to the farrowing barn and randomly assigned to individual farrowing beds which were not adjacent to lactating sows to avoid splashing of residual feed from lactating sows into the surrounding regions of gestating sows. Once the collection of microbiological samples was completed, artificial residual removal treatment was performed in the farrowing barn via removing all leftover feed in the cribs of the lactating sows immediately after feeding. The process of daily cleaning up the leftover feed in the farrowing barn lasted for 30 days. During this period the last 10 gestating sows in the breeding barn were transferred to the farrowing barn and randomly assigned to farrowing beds not adjacent to lactating sows when they were 31 days before FDD. The farrowing beds in the farrowing barn were flushed with water before arranging all the gestating sows and the residual feed of previous sows in the crib was removed. All experimental gestating sows were continued to be managed until farrowing, in which experimental animals whose true date of farrowing was more than 2 days apart from the FDD or those with disease or antibiotic use during gestation were excluded, and 25 gestating sows from a total of 30 gestating sows were consequently selected as the target of this research. Among them, 7 gestating sows were transferred to non-removal lactating residual farrowing barn (NFB) at 31 days before the FDD, 8 gestating sows were transferred to residual removal farrowing barn (RFB) at 31 days before the FDD and 10 gestating sows were retained in the BB.</p><p id="Par9">All sows in the farm were fed twice daily (6 a.m. and 3 p.m.) and gestating sows were fed with the restricted feeding strategy, whereas lactating sows were fed with the ad libitum strategy. Gestating sows received BestHuiKe 1405 commercial gestating sow feed mixed with water whereas lactating sows received BestHuiKe 1406 commercial lactating sow feed mixed with water both from Best Influx Science Bioengineering Technology Co.

Our environmental samples were collected in regions away from the lactating sows&#x02019; farrowing beds, as well as the sows were fed with wet feed which avoid microbial transmission caused by splashing or dusting of residual feed from cribs. Therefore, the effect of leftover feed on the microbial structure of the farrowing barn environment should be dependent on the microbial transmission medium.</p><p id="Par27">The association between leftover and environmental microbial structure was evidenced with the results of microbial abundance and difference probability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E and F). Half of the top ten bacteria with differential cumulative probability involving the housefly, environment and sow samples of NFB, both at the genus level and ASV level, were dominant in lactating residual feed (top 10 in relative abundance). Meanwhile, Spearman&#x02019;s correlation analysis demonstrated the correlation between the differential cumulative probability of these eligible dominant bacteria and their relative abundance in the residual feed increased over time and reached the highest value at the 8-hour time point, suggesting that there should be a sustained and cumulative effect of the residual feed on the environmental microbiota.</p><p id="Par28">Houseflies are ubiquitous and synanthropic, which allows them to transport and disperse microorganisms in urban or natural environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The removal treatment of leftover, for one thing, blocks the physical contact between the adult houseflies and leftover microbes during the feeding process. Since houseflies have the habit of laying their eggs within the food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the microorganisms in the food can colonize the gut during the larval stage of the housefly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, the removal of the residues, for another, results in newborn houseflies&#x02019; unavailability of microbes in the lactating sow residual feed in the RFB during their lifecycle, which collectively cause microbial difference between houseflies in the NFB and RFB. Paradoxically, the structural differences in microorganisms of houseflies before and after leftover removal treatments were smaller than the structural differences in microorganisms in individual environmental regions in the farrowing barn, as a transmitter of microorganisms. Previous studies have shown that the microbial structure of microbes in the body of houseflies (including in the digestive tract) is more stable than that of their surface microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], while certain microbes can maintain for more than 30 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, performing a 30-day removal residue treatment may have altered the microbes mainly on the body surface of houseflies, resulting in differences in microbial transmission, but the effect of internal microbes was relatively low. In this research, we use 16&#x000a0;S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of housefly-carried bacteria by whole pulverization of houseflies, which means the microbiota on the surface and the internal compartments of houseflies was both evaluated. On the other hand, the expected life span of houseflies is more than 30 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], making the houseflies we collected in RFB after residual removal treatment were likely to be exposed to lactating sow residual feed during their life cycle. The above factors may explain why the differences in microbial structure of houseflies were not as expected.</p><p id="Par29">Previous studies have widely documented the role of houseflies in the transmission of pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In addition, houseflies in farms during summer have been shown to transmit microorganisms within 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;km during their life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, the role of houseflies in the modification of environmental microorganisms under enclosed areas has not been evaluated. With LefSe analysis of houseflies and different environmental regions to find common target microorganisms, the results based on ASV levels showed that houseflies were more adept at spreading 70% dominant bacteria in lactating residual feed (top 10 relative abundance) than traditional pathogenic microorganisms including <italic>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</italic> (Feature 79) and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (Feature 25).
