The doxorubicin fermentation yield of the wild-type strain was very low, so it could not be produced directly by fermentation at an industrial scale due to the high cost. In the present study, <italic>S. peucetius</italic> SIPI-7-14 was obtained from SIPI-14 through several rounds of doxorubicin resistance screening. Then, the ketoreductase gene <italic>dnrU</italic> was knocked out to reduce (13<italic>S</italic>)-13-dihydrodaunorubicin production, and the resistance gene <italic>drrC</italic> was overexpressed to further enhance resistance to doxorubicin. The resulting engineered strain <italic>S. peucetius</italic> &#x025b3;U1/<italic>drrC</italic> produced 1128&#x000a0;mg/L doxorubicin, a 102.1% increase compared to that of SIPI-14. Then, fermentation medium was optimized using the response surface method. In the optimized fermentation medium, the yield of doxorubicin was increased to 1406&#x000a0;mg/L in shake flask on the 7th day. Furthermore, batch culture was carried out in a 10&#x000a0;L fermenter, and the concentration of doxorubicin reached 1461&#x000a0;mg/L after 7 days of culture, which was the highest yield reported to date, indicating the potential for industrial production of doxorubicin by fermentation.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13568-024-01699-z.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>S.

As a chemical drug, doxorubicin has a broad array of anticancer activities and is used to treat various cancers, especially hemangioma and solid tumors (Mattioli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2023</xref>). For most cancers, doxorubicin remains a first-line chemotherapy agent, either alone or in combination (Sritharan and Sivalingam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2021</xref>; Turinetto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2023</xref>). At present, daunorubicin is produced by fermentation, followed by separation, purification and chemical synthesis to produce doxorubicin. Chemical synthesis requires side chain group protection and deprotection, polluting the environment and having high production costs. In 1969, it was first reported that doxorubicin is produced in <italic>S. peucetius</italic> ATCC27952 by fermentation (Arcamone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1969</xref>). The use of doxorubicin directly obtained by fermentation is limited by the low titer used during fermentation. If a large amount of doxorubicin can be obtained directly by fermentation through a high-yielding strain and by optimizing the fermentation process, this approach will be an environmentally friendly and efficient method.</p><p id="Par3">The biosynthetic pathway of doxorubicin can be divided into three main pathways (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2022</xref>; Hutchinson and Colombo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1999</xref>). The synthesis of &#x0025b;-rhodomycinone is the first pathway involved. Under the action of a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) encoded by the <italic>dpsABCDGEFY</italic> genes, 12-deoxyacranic acid is synthesized by a multistep reaction with propionyl CoA as the starting unit and malonyl CoA as the extension unit. Then, the &#x0025b;-rhodomycinone aglycone is produced by oxygenase, methyltransferase, cyclization and reductase. The second synthesis pathway of doxorubicin is that of TDP-L-daunosamine. Through a six-step reaction, D-glucose-1-phosphate from the central metabolic pathway is synthesized to produce TDP-L-daunosamine, which involves a cluster of <italic>dnm</italic> genes, including <italic>dnmL</italic>, <italic>dnmM</italic>, <italic>dnmU</italic>, <italic>dnmT</italic>, <italic>dnmJ</italic>, and <italic>dnmV</italic>. Finally, glycosylation and postmodification of daunorubicin and doxorubicin occur. Rhodomycin-D is produced by &#x0025b;-rhodomycinone and TDP-L-daurosamine through the action of glycosyltransferase. After postmodification (demethylation, decarboxylation and hydroxylation), daunorubicin and doxorubicin are obtained. In the branch pathway, daunorubicin is converted to 13(S)-13-dihydrodaunorubicin via catalysis by the enzyme encoded by the <italic>dnrU gene</italic>. Moreover, daunorubicin and doxorubicin are converted into acid-sensitive baumycin by the enzymes encoded by the genes <italic>dnrH</italic> and <italic>dnrX</italic>, as shown in Additional file: Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.</p><p id="Par4">In <italic>S. peucetitus</italic> ATCC 27,952, the yield of doxorubicin is low, making its large-scale production difficult and high-cost. To address this problem, several efforts have been made to increase the production of doxorubicin by genetic engineering. Based on the biosynthetic pathway of doxorubicin, its production may be limited by several key enzymes, such as glycosylated genes and a P450 enzyme DoxA. Therefore, they were engineered to increase the fermentation yield of doxorubicin. The overexpression of glycosylated genes has been utilized to increase the fermentation yield of doxorubicin. Malla (Malla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>) achieved a 5.6-fold increase in doxorubicin production (approximately 10&#x000a0;mg/L) by simultaneously overexpressing the gene glycosyltransferase <italic>dnrS/dnrQ</italic> and the sugar synthesis pathway gene <italic>desIII/desIV</italic>. Recently, Zhang (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2023a</xref>) obtained a DoxA mutant, DoxA(P88Y), showed a 56% increase in the conversion efficiency of daunorubicin to doxorubicin. These results indicated that some enzymes are limiting factors in the biosynthetic pathway and their engineering is an important approach to improve doxorubicin production. In addition, it was reported that the synthesis of the secondary metabolite doxorubicin is tightly regulated. The fermentation yield of doxorubicin was increased by disrupting negative regulatory genes and overexpressing positive regulatory genes. Noh(Noh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>)enhanced the doxorubicin fermentation yield by approximately 35% (approximately 75&#x000a0;mg/L) by disrupting the downregulation of the gene <italic>wblA</italic>. In addition, the expression of the <italic>AfsR</italic> homologous regulatory gene (<italic>AfsR-p</italic>) in <italic>S. peucetius</italic> ATCC27952 led to a 4-fold increase in doxorubicin production (approximately 80&#x000a0;mg/L) (Parajuli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>). ParK (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>) increased the fermentation yield of doxorubicin by 30.8-fold (approximately 11&#x000a0;mg/L) through the overexpression of the regulatory gene <italic>dnrI</italic> in a high-copy-number plasmid combined with the optimization of the medium. Moreover, Malla(Malla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010a</xref>) increased the fermentation yield of doxorubicin by 4.3 times (approximately 7&#x000a0;mg/L) by simultaneously overexpressing the regulatory gene <italic>dnrN</italic>-<italic>dnrI</italic>-<italic>afsR</italic>. However, in all these studies, improving the yield of doxorubicin were focused on wild-type strains with low doxorubicin yields. Therefore, genetic modification of high-yielding strains is important for industrial application.</p><p id="Par5">In our previous study, we generated a <italic>S. peucetius</italic> SIPI-14 strain with significantly improved doxorubicin levels by combining the traditional method of UV and ARTP mutagenesis (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>). In the present study, a strain with doxorubicin resistance was obtained from SIPI-14 for further genetic modification combined with fermentation medium optimization to significantly improve the yield of doxorubicin, which laid a foundation for the large-scale industrial production of doxorubicin by direct fermentation in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Strains, plasmids and primers</title><p id="Par6">The strains and plasmids used in this research are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, and the primers used are listed in Additional file: Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.</p><p id="Par7">

In addition, the pH of the optimized formulation was maintained between 6.4 and 6.6, which was lower than that of the original formulation, indicating that the strain underwent a slower aging reaction in the new medium than in the other media, thereby increasing the fermentation period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Batch culture of &#x025b3;U1/<italic>drrC</italic> in 10&#x000a0;L fermenter for doxorubicin production</title><p id="Par31">To further expand the scale of cultivation, fermentation was carried out in a 10&#x000a0;L fermenter using the original and optimized media with <italic>S. peucetius</italic> &#x025b3;U1/<italic>drrC</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d and e). In the original formulation, the agitation increased rapidly during the first three days, at which point the strain grew rapidly. The biomass of the strain reached a maximum of 15% on the 4th day. The titer of doxorubicin reached 1158&#x000a0;mg/L on the 5th day of fermentation. During fermentation, the trend of the change in pH first increased, then decreased, and finally increased again. The fermentation period was short, and the biomass decreased rapidly (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). With the optimized formula, the growth rate increased rapidly in the first two days, the strains grew rapidly, and the biomass was slightly greater than that of the original formulation, reaching 15.5%; However, the biomass was maintained for a longer time. The trend of the pH change in the optimized formulation was consistent with that in the original formulation, but the pH was maintained at approximately 6.4 during the later period, which was lower than that of the original formulation. The duration of doxorubicin production in the optimized formulation was longer, probably because the biomass in the optimized formulation was maintained for a longer time, and a lower pH was more favorable for strain production. The yield of doxorubicin reached a maximum of 1461&#x000a0;mg/L on the 7th day (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e), which was slightly greater than the yield of the shaker culture.</p><p id="Par32">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par33">Secondary metabolites are generally toxic to their producers. The cytotoxicity of doxorubicin can inhibit the growth of <italic>S. peucetius</italic> and hinder product production. In our study, <italic>S. peucetius</italic> was continuously cultivated in seed medium containing doxorubicin, which made the strains more tolerant to the toxicity of their own products. By adaptive evolution, the resulted <italic>S. peucetius</italic> SIPI-7-14 showed higher biomass and doxorubicin yield than that of <italic>S. peucetius</italic> SIPI-14. The high-yielding strains can be used as better cell factories for doxorubicin production. To further increase the product tolerance, overexpression of resistance genes is another widely applied approach. Cellular resistance in <italic>S. peucetius</italic> is mediated by genes, including <italic>drrA</italic>, <italic>drrB</italic>, <italic>drrC</italic> and <italic>drrD</italic> (Karuppasamy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>). An efflux pump composed of the proteins <italic>drrA</italic> and <italic>drrB</italic> removes doxorubicin from cells (Kaur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1997</xref>). Like UvrA, the protein drrC may recognize and eliminate daunorubicin, which is embedded in DNA, thus allowing DNA replication and transcription to continue (Prija and Prasad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>). Expression of <italic>drrC</italic> in the <italic>Escherichia coli uvrA</italic> strain can significantly increase the daunorubicin resistance of the strain (Lomovskaya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1996</xref>). Directly downstream of <italic>drrA</italic> and <italic>drrB</italic> lies <italic>drrD</italic>, which is involved in self-resistance as well. <italic>S. peucetius drrD</italic> deletion mutant showed reduced self-resistance, but the molecular mechanism has not yet been known (Karuppasamy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>). In our study, overexpression of <italic>drrA</italic> and <italic>drrB</italic> resulted in an increase in the production of doxorubicin. In addition, overexpression of the resistance gene <italic>drrC</italic> produced 1128&#x000a0;mg/L doxorubicin, a 102.1% increase compared to that of SIPI-14. However, the combination of the genes <italic>drrA</italic>, <italic>drrB</italic> and <italic>drrC</italic> did not result in a greater yield than did the overexpression of <italic>drrC</italic> alone. This phenomenon is consistent with the findings of previous reports in the literature, in which the expression of both resistance systems was shown to be worse than the expression of an individual resistance system (Malla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010b</xref>). We have also tried to overexpress <italic>drrD</italic> in &#x025b3;U1, but the strain showed almost the same productivity as the parental strain.</p><p id="Par34">Secondary metabolites can generally be enhanced by deleting genes of competing pathways. In the pathway of doxorubicin biosynthesis, the <italic>dnrU</italic> coding product can catalyze daunorubicin to produce byproducts, while the <italic>dnrH</italic> and <italic>dnrX</italic> coding products can use daunorubicin and doxorubicin to produce baumycin analogs. It was reported that in <italic>S. peucetius</italic> 29,050, blocking the <italic>dnrU</italic> and <italic>dnrX</italic> increased the yield of doxorubicin by three times, compared with that of the parent strain. Inactivation of <italic>dnrH</italic> led to an 8.5-fold increase in daunorubicin production and doxorubicin production also increased (Lomovskaya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1999</xref>; Scotti and Hutchinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1996</xref>). In this study, gene <italic>dnrU</italic> was disrupted in the <italic>S. peucetius</italic>s SIPI-7-14 and the yield of doxorubicin was 21.5% greater than that of the parent strain. However, the higher fold enhancement reported in the literature may be due to the low yield of the original strain. Surprisingly, after deletion of the branch genes <italic>dnrH</italic> and <italic>dnrX</italic>, the yield of doxorubicin decreased instead, which is inconsistent with the findings of previous reports. The biomass of the engineered strain &#x025b3;H4 and &#x025b3;X1 decreased compared to that of the parental strain SIPI-7-14, from 15 to 11% and 12%, respectively. We speculated that the toxicity of doxorubicin is higher than the glycosylated product baumycin, which has a great effect on the growth of <italic>S. peucetius</italic>. The baumycin is sensitive to acid and can be easily converted into doxorubicin by adjusting the pH to 1.5&#x02013;1.8, so it will not affect the doxorubicin yield. These results indicate that there is a significant difference in the results of genetic engineering modification between high-yielding strain and wild-type strain.</p><p id="Par35">As the genetic background of strains changed after genetic engineering, it is necessary to optimize the medium or culture conditions to explore the production potential of engineered strains. This phenomenon has also been found in other strains(Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2022</xref>; Wan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2023</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2023b</xref>). RSM was widely used to design experiments and determine the optimal medium with fewer experimental trials and obtain more responses at the same time. The medium obtained through RSM method was better than previously reported single-factor optimization. The production of doxorubicin reached 1406&#x000a0;mg/L in the shake flask on the 7th day, which was 24.6% higher than before.</p><p id="Par36">In conclusion, the yield of doxorubicin can be effectively improved by combination of resistance screening, genetic engineering and optimization of culture media, a 150.6% increase compared with the parent strain SIPI-14, which was the highest reported so far (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This will make it possible to produce doxorubicin through one-step fermentation instead of existing chemical semi-synthetic production method. Meanwhile, some other products derived from actinomyces fermentation can also use this strategy to improve the fermentation yield.</p><p id="Par37">
