The main physiological effect of VB<sub>12</sub> is the inhibition of the occurrence of pernicious anaemia in animals. This vitamin is mainly used in medical treatments and as a feed or food additive. Due to its complex chemical structure and extremely cumbersome production using chemical synthesis methods, VB<sub>12</sub> is produced by microbial fermentation. Reportedly, the microorganisms that produce VB<sub>12</sub> mainly include <italic>Propionibacterium freudenreichii</italic> (<italic>P. freudenreichii</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], <italic>Pseudomonas denitrificans</italic> (<italic>P. denitrificans</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], <italic>Ensifer adhaerens</italic> (<italic>E. adhaerens</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> (<italic>S. meliloti</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Among them, <italic>Propionibacterium</italic> strains have been certified as food-safe strains by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and <italic>P. denitrificans</italic> was the first high-yielding strain used for genetic modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the production of VB<sub>12</sub> by <italic>Propionibacterium</italic> is complex, yielding many byproducts, and the production of VB<sub>12</sub> by <italic>P. denitrificans</italic> requires a long cycle and low bacterial density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Compared with the above two types of bacteria, <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> has a shorter production cycle and fewer byproducts; therefore, it has become the main strain for VB<sub>12</sub> production in recent years. Research on the production of VB<sub>12</sub> by <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> has only been reported in recent years. HOAN THI VU et al. identified the VB<sub>12</sub>-producing strain <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> CS8&#x003b1;. Gene sequencing results showed that the strain has 22 <italic>cob</italic> genes. <italic>Rhizobium</italic> strains (such as <italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum</italic> WSM2304) also have these <italic>cob</italic> genes; therefore, it is speculated that <italic>Rhizobium</italic> and <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> have the ability to biosynthesize VB<sub>12</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated the safety of <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> CICC 11008&#x000a0;s with regard to VB<sub>12</sub> production, and the results indicated that <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> strains are safe and reliable VB<sub>12</sub> producers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the biosynthesis of VB<sub>12</sub> is very complex, exhibiting a bicyclic pathway; there are approximately 30 enzymes involved in its de novo synthesis. Early scholars divided the biosynthesis pathway of VB<sub>12</sub> into an anaerobic synthesis pathway (the blue circle on the left side of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and an aerobic synthesis pathway (the red circle on the right side of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) on the basis of the dependence of microorganisms on oxygen. Later, through an in-depth comparative study of these two synthesis pathways, the main difference between the two was identified as the chelation time of cobalt ions and the enzymes that catalyse most reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The pathway for synthesizing 5-aminolevulinic acid from glutamic acid, i.e., the C5 pathway, is a common pathway that exists in most microorganisms, such as <italic>E. adhaerens</italic>, the object of this study. The pathway for synthesizing 5-aminolevulinic acid from glycine, i.e., the C4 pathway, mainly exists in some bacteria in the class Alphaproteobacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A new VB<sub>12</sub>-producing strain was discovered in this study. The strain was identified by genome bioinformatics analysis and named <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> S305 (hereinafter referred to as the S305 strain). High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to preliminarily assess the VB<sub>12</sub> production capacity of the S305 strain and an <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> strain, <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> Casida A (ATCC 33212, hereinafter referred to as the Casida A strain). Considering the significant difference in yield between the two strains, the transcription of the two strains cultured under the same conditions for different durations was compared and analysed through genome and transcriptome sequencing. Episomal overexpression of the key genes was preliminarily verified, and finally, the yield of VB<sub>12</sub> from the S305 strain was greatly improved through gene integration expression. Therefore, this study provides a new reference for the classification of <italic>Ensifer</italic> and <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> species and the genetic modification of VB<sub>12</sub>-producing strains.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Biosynthetic metabolic pathway for VB<sub>12.</sub> The green arrow in the figure represents a common pathway of VB<sub>12</sub> synthesis, the red dashed arrow represents feedback inhibition, the purple arrow and magenta arrow represent the two main metabolic pathway branches for VB<sub>12</sub>, the blue circle represents the aerobic pathway, and the red circle represents the anaerobic pathway.

Analysis of the whole-genome sequencing results showed that the genome of the S305 strain (GenBank assembly accession GCA_029439625.1) has a total length of 7,365,904&#x000a0;bp, a GC content of 62.34%, and two superlarge plasmids. The predicted number of coding sequences (CDSs) in the chromosomal genome is 6906, and the average gene length is 928&#x000a0;bp, containing 62 tRNA genes, 15 rRNA genes, 53 ncRNA genes and 3 pseudogenes. NCBI genome alignment showed that the sequence of the S305 strain is similar to those of the Casida A strain (GenBank assembly accession GCA_029674665.1) and the <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> Corn53 strain (GenBank assembly accession GCA_009883655.1). A comparison of basic genome information showed that the three strains each had a chromosome and 2 plasmids, with similar GC contents in all three (Table S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The results of a genome collinearity analysis showed that the genome sequences of the S305 strain had better collinearity with those of the Casida A strain than with those of other strains and that the S305 strain had a higher level of homology with the <italic>E. adhaerens</italic> strain (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the 16S rRNA sequence and whole-genome sequence of the S305 strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, D). The results further indicated that S305 was a <italic>Ensifer</italic> species; in addition, the average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis showed that the highest ANI value of the S305 and Casida A strains was 99.09% (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). An ANI value greater than 95% indicates that the genetic relationship between two prokaryotes is similar, and an ANI value less than 95% indicates that the strains are different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; therefore, the S305 strain could be identified and was classified as <italic>E. adhaerens</italic>.

The base sequence alignment results showed that the S305 strain was highly similar to Casida A, <italic>P. denitrificans</italic> SC 510, and <italic>Ensifer adhaerens</italic> Corn53 in terms of the genes related to the main VB<sub>12</sub> synthesis pathway (especially the genes with a <italic>cob</italic> prefix), whereas the similarity of the <italic>cob</italic> genes between the <italic>Ensifer</italic> and <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> strains was quite different from that between the strains of the <italic>Ensifer</italic> genus; VB<sub>12</sub> synthesis pathway-related genes generally exist in strains of these two genera, and most of the gene sequences have high similarity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A).

However, this conclusion has not been unanimously agreed upon by rhizobial taxonomists, and most rhizobial taxonomists still do not agree with changing the name of <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic>. In this study, the results of a phylogenetic tree analysis showed that <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> and <italic>Ensifer</italic> are closely related, but the comparison of ANI values indirectly indicated that the genome sequences of <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> and <italic>Ensifer</italic> (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) are quite different.

Experiments have shown that the overexpression of the <italic>hemA</italic> and <italic>cobA</italic> genes can increase the yield of VB<sub>12</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The <italic>cobT</italic> gene is an important gene in the salvage pathway of VB<sub>12</sub> synthesis. The protein encoded by this gene can synthesize VB<sub>12</sub> in two steps by catalysing the conversion of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; therefore, the significantly upregulated transcription of the <italic>hemA</italic>, <italic>cobA</italic>, and <italic>cobT</italic> genes in the S305 strain may be directly related to the high VB<sub>12</sub> yield of this strain. In this study, the yield of VB<sub>12</sub> improved significantly after the integrated overexpression of the <italic>cobA</italic> and <italic>cobT</italic> genes in the S305 strain. <italic>cobJ</italic>, <italic>cobN</italic>, <italic>cobP</italic>, and <italic>cobR</italic> are all genes involved in intermediate steps of VB<sub>12</sub> synthesis, and the <italic>cobJ</italic> gene sequence in the S305 strain varies greatly from that in the Casida A strain (Table S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The prediction of the protein encoded by this gene also showed obvious structural variation (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The <italic>cobN</italic> gene encodes a cobalt transport and chelating protein that is very important for the integration of cobalt ions in the porphyrin ring in the centre of the chemical structure of VB<sub>12</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The upregulation of the transcription intensity of these genes may also increase VB<sub>12</sub> yield. In addition, episomal overexpression of these genes increased the VB<sub>12</sub> yield of the Casida A strain. <italic>hemY</italic> is a key gene for the synthesis of heme, which is needed for the synthesize of protoporphyrin IX from coproporphyrinogen III. Reportedly, the accumulation of coproporphyrinogen III can inhibit the activity of <italic>hemE</italic>, which in turn facilitates the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to protocorrin-2, eventually leading to an increase in VB<sub>12</sub> yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Transcriptomic and qPCR data showed that the transcription intensity of the <italic>hemY</italic> gene of the Casida A strain was significantly higher than that of the <italic>hemY</italic> gene of the S305 strain, potentially leading to the accelerated conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrin IX in the haem synthesis pathway in the Casida A strain, thereby releasing the feedback inhibition effect of coproporphyrinogen III on hemE, resulting in increased shunting of uroporphyrinogen III to haem synthesis and ultimately reducing the amount of VB<sub>12</sub> synthesized. The <italic>cysG</italic> gene encodes siroheme synthase, which is important in another branch of VB<sub>12</sub> biosynthesis. The Casida A strain exhibited significantly higher transcription of this gene than the S305 strain. Because the metabolic branch is shunted to synthesize more siroheme, VB<sub>12</sub> yield in the Casida A strain may be lower, and the subsequent weakening of the <italic>hemY</italic> gene and the knockout of the <italic>cysG</italic> gene may further improve VB<sub>12</sub> yield in the S305 strain.
