The richness and diversity of protoberberine alkaloids accumulated in the <italic toggle="yes">Coptis</italic> genus necessitate a comprehensive examination of the biosynthetic machinery to understand their ecological significance. Here, from <italic toggle="yes">Coptis chinensis</italic> we identified CcCYP719A1, which could install a methylenedioxy bridge on either ring A or ring D of the protoberberine backbone, thus diverging metabolite flux towards the biosynthesis of various protoberberine components. We also obtained CcCYP719A2 and CcCYP719A3, which underwent positive selection after diverging from CcCYP719A1 and maintained specific catalytic activity on ring D. Further, we resolved the biosynthetic pathway of jatrorrhizine by identifying two demethylases, which could also modulate protoberberine composition by removing the C-3 methyl group and methylenedioxy bridge of ring D, allowing demethylated metabolites to be redirected into different routes. Moreover, we characterized 2-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-methyltransferase CcOMT1 and flavin-dependent oxidase CcTHBO, respectively responsible for the commonly observed 2-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-methylation and aromatic ring-C assembly in protoberberine alkaloids. Overall, this study reveals an interconnected metabolite network from which diverse protoberberine alkaloids originate. It provides valuable insights into the existence of undiscovered protoberberine components, and paves the way for the targeted production of desired protoberberine components for potential therapeutic development.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source>

Ancient pharmacological texts, which documented the usage of herbal medicines, are invaluable resources that have significantly influenced modern pharmacology and the development of novel pharmacophores. A notable example is the discovery of artemisinin, an anti-malaria natural product identified from <italic toggle="yes">Artemisia annua</italic> L., with historical usage dating back over 2000 years for its anti-infective properties, as recorded in the Shennong&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">Classic of Materia Medica</italic> [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition to <italic toggle="yes">A. annua</italic>, numerous other medicinal herbs with excellent therapeutic properties have been passed down through a thousand years of practice. One distinctive example is Coptidis Rhizoma, generally prepared from the rhizome of <italic toggle="yes">Coptis chinensis</italic> Franch., <italic toggle="yes">C. deltoidea</italic> C. Y. Cheng et Hsiao, or <italic toggle="yes">C. teeta</italic> Wall [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Culturally, Coptidis Rhizoma is renowned for its intensely bitter taste and characteristic yellow staining. Pharmacologically, it has been an essential ingredient in many ancient pharmacological recipes for treating inflammation and various gastrointestinal ailments [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Modern phytochemical and pharmacological research has revealed that the primary active constituents of Coptidis Rhizoma are a group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) featuring the 5,6-dihydrodibenzo[a,g]quinolizinium system, collectively known as protoberberine alkaloids (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although protoberberine alkaloids are broadly found in various plant families, such as Ranunculaceae, Papaveraceae, Berberidaceae, Menispermaceae, and Rutaceae, species of the <italic toggle="yes">Coptis</italic> genus appear to be outstanding producers of protoberberine alkaloids in terms of quantity and diversity [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Over 20 protoberberine components have been found in <italic toggle="yes">Coptis</italic> species, the total content ranging from 5 to 10% [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Yet our knowledge about the physiological role of protoberberine alkaloids in the survival and fitness of <italic toggle="yes">Coptis</italic> species remains limited. The ecological significance of the lineage-specific increase in the abundance and diversity of protoberberine is also unknown. Addressing these questions would require a comprehensive understanding of protoberberine alkaloid biosynthesis.</p><fig position="float" id="f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Protoberberine alkaloids produced by <italic toggle="yes">Coptis</italic> genus. <bold>A</bold> Chinese indigenous <italic toggle="yes">Coptis</italic> cultivar <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic> and representative protoberberine alkaloids derived from Coptidis Rhizoma. <bold>B</bold> Previously elucidated biosynthetic pathway of protoberberine alkaloids.

Among them, the biosynthetic pathway of berberine has been elucidated (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-Scoulerine, the common precursor of protoberberine alkaloids, first undergoes 9-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-methylation by (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine 9-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-methyltransferase (SOMT) to generate (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-tetrahydrocolumbamine [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which is then subjected to methylenedioxy bridge installation by CYP719A1 (canadine synthase) [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Finally, berberine is produced from (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-canadine through oxidation catalyzed by tetrahydroberberine oxidase (THBO) [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On this basis, the biosynthetic pathway of columbamine was determined by identifying the oxidation of (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-tetrahydrocolumbamine to generate columbamine by (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase (THPO) [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Further, the biosynthetic pathway for palmatine was determined by characterizing columbamine <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-methyltransferase, which catalyzes the conversion of columbamine to palmatine (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, both coptisine and epiberberine contain a methylenedioxy bridge on ring D of the protoberberine backbone, distinct from the methylenedioxy bridge of berberine on ring A, suggesting another CYP719 enzyme is responsible for their biosynthesis. The elucidation of the sanguinarine biosynthetic pathway showed that two CYP719 enzymes, cheilanthifoline synthase (CYP719A5) and stylopine synthase (CYP719A2), identified from <italic toggle="yes">Eschscholzia californica</italic>, convert (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine into (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-stylopine [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is likely that epiberberine and coptisine are respectively derived from (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-cheilanthifoline and (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-stylopine, and their complete biosynthetic pathways are yet to be established (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, dashed arrows). An exhaustive search for the potential methylenedioxy bridge-installing enzyme from the <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic> genome resulted in the identification of six candidates [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Subsequent biochemical assays only determined one candidate (Cch00017825) that can install a methylenedioxy bridge on ring A, leaving the putative CYP719 enzyme for ring D unaccounted for [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Compared with the above-mentioned protoberberine alkaloids, jatrorrhizine lacks an <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-methylation modification on the hydroxyl group of C-3, which is already installed on (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine. This discrepancy has raised the question of whether (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine is a biosynthetic precursor for jatrorrhizine. Surrounding this, various hypotheses have been made with regard to the branching point from which the biosynthesis of jatrorrhizine diverges [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, to date, none of these hypotheses has been validated through the identification of corresponding biosynthetic enzymes or intermediates from jatrorrhizine-producing plants.</p><p>Here we unveil a biosynthetic network for protoberberine alkaloids in <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic>. We demonstrate that the synthetic capacity of this network surpasses the currently established phytochemical profile of <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic>, suggesting the potential application of the characterized enzymes in alternative methods to access valuable protoberberine components.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec5"><title>Versatile CcCYP719A1 is primarily responsible for protoberberine biosynthesis</title><p>We first obtained the transcriptome of <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic> by subjecting freshly sampled leaf, root, and rhizome to RNA sequencing. This generated 820.2 million clean reads, from which we assembled a transcriptome containing 94&#x02009;916 unique transcripts. The expression level of the transcripts was quantified and normalized across the samples. Both coptisine and epiberberine contain a methylenedioxy bridge structure, a modification generally installed by enzymes of the CYP719 clan in the plant&#x02019;s specialized metabolism [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, we examined the expression level of the six candidate CYP719 transcripts (referred to as <italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A1</italic> to <italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A6</italic>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Table S1</xref>). Among them, <italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A1</italic> showed the highest expression level, while the remaining five transcripts were barely expressed in all sequenced samples (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S1</xref>). To confirm the activity of the CYP719 candidates, all six transcripts were cloned onto the pESC-HIS vector and expressed individually in <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain WAT11, which incorporates the <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> origin cytochrome P450 reductase <italic toggle="yes">ATR1</italic> [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Microsomes were prepared from the recombinant WAT11 strain, and subjected to enzyme assay using (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine as substrate. The cheilanthifoline synthase CYP719A5, identified from <italic toggle="yes">E. californica</italic>, was used as control. Among the candidates, CcCYP719A1 (Cch00017825) transformed the substrate into (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-nandinine as previously reported [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum of the hypothesized (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-nandinine showed peaks at 176.0706 and 151.0754, representing free hydroxyl and methoxy groups on ring D and the methylenedioxy bridge on ring A, indicating it is (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-nandinine (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S2</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that CcCYP719A1, CcCYP719A2, and CcCYP719A3 could also convert (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine into (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-cheilanthifoline, compared with the retention time of (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-cheilanthifoline standard (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum of both the (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-cheilanthifoline product and the standard compound exhibited distinctive peaks at 178.0863 and 149.0597, indicating a free hydroxyl and methoxy group on ring A and a methoxy group on ring D (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S2</xref>). Furthermore, CcCYP719A1 exhibited activity towards (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-cheilanthifoline and (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-tetrahydrocolumbamine, producing (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-stylopine and (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-canadine, respectively (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and C</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S3</xref>). However, CcCYP719A2 and CcCYP719A3 showed no such activity. These findings demonstrate that CcCYP719A1 possesses cheilanthifoline synthase, stylopine synthase, and canadine synthase activities, indicating its ability to catalyze methylenedioxy bridge formation on both ring A and ring D of the protoberberine backbone.</p><p>CcCYP719A1 exhibits a high sequence identity of ~70% with CcCYP719A2/CcCYP719A3, but it demonstrated greater substrate promiscuity compared with its two paralogs. To investigate the structural basis for their different substrate selectivity, we employed AlphaFold to predict the 3D structures of both CcCYP719A1 and CcCYP719A2. Employing molecular docking analysis, we discovered that (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine could bind in two distinct orientations in the catalytic pocket of CcCYP719A1 with similar binding energy (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S4</xref>). On the other hand, (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine adopts a slanted position in CcCYP719A2, with its hydroxyl group and methoxy group of ring D directed towards the catalytic heme (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S4</xref>). Notably, the active site of CcCYP719A1 contains residues such as Thr111, Thr120, Glu288, Ile360, and Phe474, which, when compared with their counterparts in CcCYP719A2 (His123, Ser135, Glu303, Leu376, and Leu490), offer less steric hindrance to the protoberberine scaffold, resulting in greater substrate binding flexibility (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). This flexibility allows the substrate to orient either ring A or ring D towards the catalytic heme, accounting for the observed substrate promiscuity of CcCYP719A1. Moreover, His123, Phe230, and Phe299 in CcCYP719A2 appear to play a crucial role in positioning and stabilizing the substrate through &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking interactions with the tetracyclic ring. However, the corresponding residues in CcCYP719A1 (Ile215, Phe284, and Thr111) are unable to achieve the same effect (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Additionally, the modeling of (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-cheilanthifoline and (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-tetrahydrocolumbamine in CcCYP719A2 displayed a similar slanted conformation, with their respective ring D positioned towards the catalytic site. Taken together, these factors exclude the potential activity of CcCYP719A2 on ring A of protoberberine alkaloid, resulting in its specific cheilanthifoline synthase activity (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p>Genomic information reported earlier demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A4</italic>&#x02013;<italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A6</italic> are clustered with <italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A1</italic> on chromosome 3, suggesting that they might have originated from a tandem duplication event. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A3</italic> are located on chromosomes 4 and 9, respectively [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This arrangement implies that <italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A3</italic> may have originated from a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event. To further explore the evolutionary relationships of the characterized CYP719 enzymes in this study, a maximum likelihood tree was constructed using multiple sequence alignments of CYP719 genes identified from various plant families (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">CcCYP719A1</italic> shares close phylogeny with its ortholog <italic toggle="yes">CYP719A1</italic> from <italic toggle="yes">Coptis japonica</italic>. However, a previous study as well as our own enzyme assays have indicated that CYP719A1 only exhibits canadine synthase activity (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S5</xref>) [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The different substrate scopes exhibited by CcCYP719A1 and CYP719A1 suggests that slight variations in the primary sequence of CYP719 enzymes can shift the substrate recognition pattern.

The analysis revealed significant positive selection on this branch (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Table S2</xref>). Considering that CcCYP719A2 and CcCYP719A3 can be functionally covered by CcCYP719A1 and they are minimally expressed in all sequenced samples, it is plausible that these genes have experienced a relaxation of evolutionary constraints since diverging from CcCYP719A1.

This search yielded 80 candidate transcripts. Further, we excluded transcripts with coding sequences shorter than 600&#x000a0;bp, resulting in 38 remaining candidates. These candidates were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis using representative sequences from three methyltransferase families (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S10</xref>) [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. With the 14 candidates that clustered with known BIA biosynthetic genes, we performed Pfam domain analysis and multiple sequence alignment.

(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-Tetrahydroepiberberine can also be transformed by CcTHBO into epiberberine, thereby establishing its biosynthetic pathway (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).

This confirms that, for epiberberine biosynthesis, enzyme promiscuity allows the reaction sequences of methylation and methylenedioxy bridge formation to be interchangeable. Overall, the biosynthetic pathways of coptisine and epiberberine are established by identifying the versatile CcCYP719A1, which directs the branching from (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine to generate products with methylenedioxy bridge modification on ring D.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Biosynthetic pathway of jatrorrhizine</title><p>(<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-Scoulerine, constructed by the berberine bridge enzyme from (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-reticuline, is the common precursor of protoberberine alkaloids. (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-Scoulerine is methylated on the C-3 hydroxyl group, and this modification is present in all major protoberberine alkaloids produced in <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic> except for jatrorrhizine. This discrepancy therefore becomes the most critical issue in elucidating jatrorrhizine biosynthesis, regarding whether (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine is a precursor of jatrorrhizine. If (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine is not a precursor of jatrorrhizine, the biosynthesis of jatrorrhizine must have diverged from the isoquinoline common pathway as early as norcoclaurine, which is the condensation product of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S14</xref>). This indicates that downstream tailoring enzymes should accept the unmethylated substrates in parallel to serve for jatrorrhizine biosynthesis. However, no unmethylated intermediate derived from (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-norcoclaurine has been reported, leaving this assumption weakly supported. Alternatively, if (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine is indeed the precursor of jatrorrhizine, a demethylase is required to remove the <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-methylation on C-3 at some point along the pathway. In fact, enzymes from several families have been reported to catalyze demethylation reactions [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;31</xref>]. Notably, the biosynthesis of morphine, another type of BIA, also involves demethylation steps. Its biosynthetic intermediates thebaine and codeine can be transformed by codeine <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-demethylase (CODM), a 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase, to produce oripavine and morphine, respectively [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

When (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine was used as the substrate, CODM successfully produced the expected demethylated scoulerine, confirming the reliability of our bioassay system (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S15</xref>). Interestingly, another demethylation product was observed in the reaction mixture of Cc6DM2 and Cc6DM3. This product shares the same molecular mass as the demethylated scoulerine generated by CODM, but showed a slightly earlier elution time in the HPLC analysis, indicating it was likely the C-10 demethylated product of (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S15</xref>). When (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-tetrahydrocolumbamine was incubated with Cc6DM2 or Cc6DM3, a demethylation product different from (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-scoulerine was produced; the MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum of the demethylation product indicates that the demethylation occurs on C-3 (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A and B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S16</xref>). However, none of the demethylase candidates showed activity towards columbamine (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S17</xref>). In the case of palmatine, only a trace amount of transformation was observed in the overnight reaction mixture of Cc6DM2 or Cc6DM3. The retention time and MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum of the product matched that of authentic jatrorrhizine (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data Fig. S18</xref>). Since only a trace amount of palmatine was converted into jatrorrhizine, it is likely that palmatine is not the natural substrate for the demethylases. Overall, these results strongly suggest that jatrorrhizine biosynthesis branches from the demethylation of (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-tetrahydrocolumbamine. To be converted to jatrorrhizine, demethyl-tetrahydrocolumbamine needs to be methylated on C-2 and oxidized on ring C. Based on the assembly logic of epiberberine, we propose that CcOMT1 and CcTHBO are responsible for the transformation from demethyl-tetrahydrocolumbamine to jatrorrhizine. Subsequently, we purified demethyl-tetrahydrocolumbamine from the Cc6DM3 assay and tested it with both CcTHBO and CcOMT1. The results showed that both enzymes could utilize demethyl-tetrahydrocolumbamine as substrate, producing (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-tetrahydrojatrorrhizine (also known as corypalmine) and demethyleneberberine, respectively (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C and D</xref>).

In this study, we characterized the biosynthetic pathway of key protoberberine components in <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic>, revealing a complex and interconnected metabolite network (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that the diversity of protoberberine alkaloids does not arise from the actions of specific enzymes dedicated to distinct routes, but is achieved through the collaboration of versatile modifying enzymes. These enzymes catalyze branching reactions from various biosynthetic intermediates, ultimately giving rise to different protoberberine components. This protoberberine metabolite network holds significant promise for the targeted biosynthesis of protoberberine components and their derivatives in selected chassis cells. By manipulating the expression of the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes, we could potentially engineer the production of specific protoberberine alkaloids with tailored properties. Furthermore, the protoberberine metabolite network not only delineates the biosynthetic routes of major protoberberine components but also establishes the underlying assembly logic for the entire group of protoberberine alkaloids. This valuable insight allows us to predict the biosynthetic routes of uncharacterized protoberberine components by tracing relevant intermediates through the metabolite network. For example, C-5 hydroxylated berberine (berberastine), which is also produced by <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic>, has not been biosynthetically characterized thus far [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, its biosynthetic pathway could be readily inferred from the network, which may branch from the berberine biosynthetic route (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p>In exploring plant specialized metabolism, poorly accumulated metabolites might elude detection due to limitations in analytical methodologies. This raises the intriguing question of whether there are hidden protoberberine components beyond the currently established phytochemical profile of <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic>. The metabolite network has shed light on this hidden protoberberine repository, as demonstrated by the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> reconstitution of thalifendine biosynthesis (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B and C</xref>). This implies that the biosynthetic route of some unidentified protoberberine components, represented by thalifendine, is diminished under physiological conditions by unknown regulatory mechanisms, hindering their characterization. Consequently, it is likely that the actual biosynthetic capacity of <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic> has been underestimated; limited substrate availability prevented us from fully evaluating the capacity through <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> enzyme assays. Taken together, these unidentified protoberberine alkaloids constitute the &#x02018;dark matter&#x02019; within the protoberberine repository. Future investigations employing high-resolution metabolomics could offer promising avenues to fully exploit the protoberberine metabolite network, ultimately providing a comprehensive understanding of the synthetic capabilities of <italic toggle="yes">Coptis</italic> species.</p><p>In this work, we also identified two unusual demethylases, Cc6DM2 and Cc6DM3, that belong to the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. In eukaryotic primary metabolism, members of this family can act as histone demethylases that dynamically regulate histone methylation [<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This epigenetic regulation is associated with many crucial cellular processes and physiological activities [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Similarly, in protoberberine biosynthesis, Cc6DM2 and Cc6DM3 can remove the C-3 methyl group and methylenedioxy bridge of ring D, allowing demethylated metabolites to be redirected into different routes. We thus propose that Cc6DM2 and Cc6DM3 retain vestigial regulatory function from their common ancestor with histone demethylases. The protoberberine demethylases could collaborate with protoberberine <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-methyltransferases and modulate the composition of the protoberberine repository through a methylation&#x02013;demethylation tuning strategy. Previously, biosynthesis&#x02013;regulation intersections have been observed in certain scenarios, where a natural product with DNA-binding activity can intercalate with the promoter region of a gene encoding a positive regulatory protein, thereby inhibiting the biosynthesis of the natural product itself [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Similarly, by playing dual roles in protoberberine biosynthesis and the composition-tuning process, Cc6DM2 and Cc6DM3 might also constitute an intersection between biosynthesis and regulation. More examples that employ different paradigms of such intersection might be uncovered in the future to provide fresh perspectives on plant specialized metabolism [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the metabolite network could be a strategy employed not only by <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic> but also by various other plants to achieve chemical diversity and regulatory flexibility. It allows the production of a large metabolite repository with a minimal number of biosynthetic enzymes, an energy-efficient strategy that could facilitate the adaptation of the host plant. Future characterizations of the regulation of metabolite networks could provide us with a deeper understanding of their ecological roles and shed light on how plants use these networks to thrive in their environments.</p></sec><sec id="sec11"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec12"><title>Plant materials and compounds</title><p>Three-year-old <italic toggle="yes">C. chinensis</italic> plants were collected from the Huanglian plantation base of Enshi city, Hubei province, China.
