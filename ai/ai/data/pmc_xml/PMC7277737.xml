The antitumor activity of AP-3 is a result of its affinity towards &#x003b2;-tubulin in eukaryotic cells. In this study, in order to improve AP-3 production, the reason for severe growth inhibition of the AP-3 producing strain <italic>Actinosynnema pretiosum</italic> WXR-24 under high concentrations of exogenous AP-3 was investigated. The cell division protein FtsZ, which is the analogue of &#x003b2;-tubulin in bacteria, was discovered to be the AP-3 target through structural comparison followed by a SPR biosensor assay. AP-3 was trapped into a less hydrophilic groove near the GTPase pocket on FtsZ by hydrogen bounding and hydrophobic interactions, as revealed by docking analysis. After overexpression of the <italic>APASM_5716</italic> gene coding for FtsZ in WXR-30, the resistance to AP-3 was significantly improved. Moreover, AP-3 yield was increased from 250.66 mg/L to 327.37 mg/L. After increasing the concentration of supplemented yeast extract, the final yield of AP-3 reached 371.16 mg/L. In summary, we demonstrate that the cell division protein FtsZ is newly identified as the bacterial target of AP-3, and improving resistance is an effective strategy to enhance AP-3 production.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ansamitocin P-3</kwd><kwd>FtsZ</kwd><kwd>tubulin</kwd><kwd>toxicity</kwd><kwd>resistance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-biomolecules-10-00699"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Ansamitocin P-3 (AP-3) is an important antitumor agent with potent activity against various cancer cell lines [<xref rid="B1-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since 2012, AP-3 has been used as the &#x02018;warhead&#x02019; molecule of the currently commercialized antibody-conjugated (ADC) drug trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for the treatment of breast cancer [<xref rid="B3-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. T-DM1 is also under clinical trials for the treatment of HER2-positive lung cancer [<xref rid="B4-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, binding of AP-3 on &#x003b2;-tubulin inhibits microtubule assembly and chromosome segregation during the interphase and mitotic phase resulting in cell apoptosis [<xref rid="B5-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. AP-3 has a strong interaction with &#x003b2;-tubulin with a dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.7 &#x000b5;M [<xref rid="B5-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a high-resolution crystal structure of tubulin in complex with maytansine, an AP-3 analogue [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], it was found that binding of maytansine interferes the interaction of longitudinal tubulin in microtubule assembly. The identified maytansine-binding site is distinct from the vinblastine-binding site, and is also shown as the common binding site of a rhizoxin variant and PM060184 [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Since tubulin is not present in bacterial cells, the intracellular targets of AP-3 in bacteria are still unknown. The cell division protein FtsZ has been shown to have similar function and architecture with tubulin [<xref rid="B7-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both FtsZ and tubulin work as cytoskeletons and form filaments with GTP hydrolysis [<xref rid="B10-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several compounds, such as curcumin, taxanes and plumbagin, are found to inhibit the function of tubulin as well as FtsZ [<xref rid="B9-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Whether AP-3 is also an inhibitor of FtsZ remained to be studied.</p><p>As an important drug precursor, various strategies have been applied to improve AP-3 yield [<xref rid="B12-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Previously in our lab, a high-yield AP-3 producing strain <italic>Actinosynnema pretiosum</italic> NXJ-24 was constructed by engineering the post-modification steps, which resulted in a 5-fold increase in AP-3 yield to 246 mg/L [<xref rid="B14-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the AP-3 yield could not be further improved despite several attempts, suggesting a cell inhibition or toxicity effect caused by high concentrations of AP-3. </p><p>In this study, the cell toxicity of AP-3 against its producing strain was observed and investigated. The interaction of AP-3 with FtsZ was validated by SPR biosensor analysis, in vitro assembly assay and docking analysis. Further overexpression of FtsZ improved the resistance of the resulting strain and the yield of AP-3 as well. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-biomolecules-10-00699"><title>2.

Cell Division Protein FtsZ is Predicted as a Target of AP-3</title><p>Since the growth of WXR-24 was inhibited by AP-3 supplementation, in order to understand the mechanism, it is necessary to identify the intracellular targets of AP-3. In eukaryotic cells, AP-3 binds to &#x003b2;-tubulin and consequently inhibits microtubule assembly and cell division [<xref rid="B7-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Because tubulins are not present in <italic>A. pretiosum</italic>, it was therefore inferred that FtsZ, as a structural homolog to tubulin [<xref rid="B23-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], is likely to be the intracellular target of AP-3. To confirm the hypothesis above, the two structures were compared.</p><p>The structure of FtsZ in WXR-24 was simulated by homologous modeling based on the structure of FtsZ from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 5v68).

The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the two proteins are divided by the featured &#x003b1;-helix 7 located horizontally in the middle of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00699-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b). </p><p>These two structures were further compared according to the flexible structure alignment algorithm [<xref rid="B18-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

The interaction of FtsZ with AP-3 was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor analysis. Before analysis, 6000 RU of FtsZ was immobilized on a CM5 chip, then AP-3 solutions with concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 &#x003bc;M successively flew over the FtsZ conjugated surface. The injection of 6.25&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M AP-3 induced a gradually increased response of the FtsZ-bound surface, indicating a stable binding between FtsZ and AP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00699-f003">Figure 3</xref>a).

The GTPase activity of FtsZ was slightly decreased upon AP-3 addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00699-f003">Figure 3</xref>c), suggesting that FtsZ assembly is inhibited by AP-3 binding in a GTPase-independent manner. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-biomolecules-10-00699"><title>3.4. Docking Analysis of AP-3 on FtsZ </title><p>Since AP-3 was confirmed to bind to FtsZ and inhibit FtsZ assembly, it is necessary to explore the interaction between AP-3 and FtsZ at the molecular level. For this purpose, docking analysis was performed around the putative maytansine-binding structure on FtsZ obtained from the structure comparison in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2-biomolecules-10-00699">Section 3.2</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00699-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, the AP-3 binding site is at the edge of the junction region between two FtsZ monomers, which explains the inhibition of FtsZ assembly by AP-3 supplementation and the unaffected GTPase activity of FtsZ. Whereas the surface of FtsZ is highly hydrophilic, the AP-3 binding pocket is comprised of less hydrophilic amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00699-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). The macrolactam ring of AP-3 is inserted into the hydrophobic pocket, and key amino acid residues of FtsZ interacting with AP-3 are identified as Pro92, His96, Gly129, Gln169 and Asn173. In detail, the carbinolamide ring of AP-3 is attached to the amine groups of Gln169 and Asn173 with hydrogen bonds, and the nearby oxygen atom on C-10 of AP-3 forms hydrogen bond with the amine group on His96.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, FtsZ was identified as the intracellular target of AP-3 in <italic>A. pretiosum.</italic> It was initially believed that AP-3 is not toxic to bacteria, because tubulin does not exist in bacteria. However, since the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ was reported to have a similar structure to tubulin, it was inferred that FtsZ might be a target of AP-3 [<xref rid="B7-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this study, structures of FtsZ from <italic>A. pretiosum</italic> and &#x003b2;-tubulin from <italic>Bos taurus</italic> were compared and shown to be structurally similar to each other [<xref rid="B18-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In a subsequent in vitro interaction test, it was validated that AP-3 could bind to FtsZ and inhibit FtsZ assembly. This is the first time that the bacterial target of AP-3 has been identified. Our further experiments found that AP-3 could also inhibit the assembly of FtsZ from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-00699">Figure S8</xref>), indicating that the inhibition of AP-3 on FtsZ is not limited in <italic>Actinosynnema</italic> but broadly applicable among bacteria. </p><p>Some antitumor antibiotics also showed cell toxicities towards their bacterial producers [<xref rid="B24-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. During the production of antitumor tiancimycin A, for example, its accumulation was extremely toxic to its producer <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. CB03234, and the yield was only 0.2 mg/L [<xref rid="B27-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this study, it was observed that exogenous AP-3 at a concentration higher than 300 mg/L caused severe inhibition on the growth of WXR-24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00699-f001">Figure 1</xref>c and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-00699">Table S2</xref>). Improving strain resistance has been widely used to enhance the yields of various antibiotics, such as oxytetracycline [<xref rid="B28-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], doxorubicin [<xref rid="B29-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], rimocidin [<xref rid="B30-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], daptomycin [<xref rid="B31-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and toyocamycin [<xref rid="B32-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, these strategies mainly focus on overexpressing efflux genes or engineering resistance genes. As another option, overexpressing the drug targets has also been long used to alleviate cell toxicities and improve resistance [<xref rid="B33-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example, the overexpression of <italic>embAB</italic> genes, coding for the targets of the antimycobacterial compound ethambutol (Emb), resulted in Emb resistance [<xref rid="B34-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

In our study, overexpression of the AP-3 target FtsZ improved both strain resistance and AP-3 production, showing again that the overexpression of target proteins is an effective way to enhance antibiotic production. </p><p>FtsZ plays a fundamental role in cell division of bacteria. Before cell division, a ring-like structure is formed in the middle of the dividing cell by FtsZ polymerization, which then recruits other related proteins to start the dividing program [<xref rid="B9-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Increased expression of <italic>ftsZ</italic> often results in change of cell morphology. For example, in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>ftsZ</italic> overexpression will cause asymmetric cell division [<xref rid="B36-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], while in <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> an increase in cell diameter is observed [<xref rid="B38-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Improved expression of <italic>ftsZ</italic> in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> and <italic>S. lividans</italic> inhibited aerial mycelia and spore formation, and antibiotic production was increased [<xref rid="B39-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In our study, it was found the length of the branching hyphae in the <italic>ftsZ</italic>-overexpressing mutant WXR-30 was much shorter than the control strain (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-00699">Figure S6</xref>).

The relationship between mycelial morphology and AP-3 resistance or production needs further investigation. </p><p>The cell toxicity of AP-3 on its producer <italic>A. pretiosum</italic> was less pronounced than on eukaryotic cells. In fact, the IC<sub>50</sub> of AP-3 on MCF-7 cells is 20 &#x000b1; 3 pmol/L, which is much lower than that on <italic>A. pretiosum</italic> (315.0&#x02013;472.4 &#x003bc;mol/L).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00699-f004">Figure 4</xref>d, three hydrogen bonds are formed between AP-3 and Gly129, Asn173 and Gln169 on FtsZ, with bond lengths of 3.1, 5.9 and 3.9 &#x000c5;, respectively. In comparison, five hydrogen bonds are formed between maytansine and Gly100, Asn102, Lys105, Asn101 and Val181 on &#x003b2;-tubulin, with bond lengths of 3.1, 3.2, 2.5, 3.3 and 2.9 &#x000c5;, respectively. As hydrogen bonding is relatively strong among intermolecular interactions [<xref rid="B41-biomolecules-10-00699" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the interaction between AP-3 and &#x003b2;-tubulin is therefore much stronger than that with FtsZ, which explains the toxicity of AP-3 towards <italic>A. pretiosum</italic> only at high concentrations.</p><p>Although the resistance of WXR-30 was substantially improved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00699-f004">Figure 4</xref>a), the strain was still sensitive to 300 mg/L and 400 mg/L AP-3, which implies that FtsZ overexpression could not fully confer resistance to AP-3. From our docking analysis, five key amino acid residues, namely Pro92, His96, Gly129, Gln169 and Asn173, were proposed to interact with AP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00699-f004">Figure 4</xref>d). Therefore, these key residues, especially Gly129, Gln169 and Asn173 forming hydrogen bonds with AP-3, will be considered for future mutagenesis to further alleviate or even abolish the interactions and consequent cell toxicity. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-biomolecules-10-00699"><title>5.
