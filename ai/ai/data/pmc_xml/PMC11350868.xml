Introduction</title><p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a current significant issue in global public health. Its severity has heightened due to the excessive and inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents in humans, animals, and plants and insufficient infection prevention measures. This contributes to the emergence of new and resistant microorganisms in the environmental habitat. In 2019, there were 1.27 million deaths attributable to bacterial antimicrobial resistance. Unfortunately, methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) was among the top pathogens responsible for mortality associated with antimicrobial resistance [<xref rid="B1-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The prediction indicates a potential increase to 10 million annual deaths by 2050 with a projected economic impact of USD 100 trillion [<xref rid="B2-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to the natural evolutionary process, organisms develop genetic mutations to withstand lethal selection pressures. AMR is inevitable and bacteria will inherently adapt and exhibit defensive mechanisms as long as antibacterial agents are utilized against them.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>) exhibits the capacity to cause significant infections and resistance to various antibacterial medications. <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> has the ability to adapt to both its human host and the environment, becoming resistant to antibiotics. It is a prominent causative microorganism of endocarditis, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and skin and soft tissue infections. Each of these conditions has the potential to result in sepsis eventually. After the introduction of the first semi-synthetic anti-staphylococcal penicillins around 1960, the emergence of MRSA was observed within 1 year of their clinical application [<xref rid="B3-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Resistance to methicillin in <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> is due to the existence of the <italic toggle="yes">mec</italic>A (or <italic toggle="yes">mec</italic>C) gene, which is responsible for encoding the penicillin-binding protein PBP2a. This protein exhibits reduced affinity for semi-synthetic penicillins [<xref rid="B4-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized MRSA as a high-priority concern, highlighting the urgent need to develop antimicrobial agents for clinical situations. The golden era of antibiotics is fading due to the lack of discovery of new classes of antibiotics leading to the transition into a &#x0201c;post-antibiotics&#x0201d; era. This transition means a lack of effective drugs for antimicrobial-resistance treatment. Therefore, the discovery of new antimicrobial agents for treating infectious diseases caused by MRSA is very urgent.</p><p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are present in every kingdom of life and they are an essential element of host defense mechanisms. AMPs represent a category of short-chain peptides, typically comprising amino acids ranging from 12 to 50 residues. Discovered in 1939 from <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus brevis</italic>, gramicidin was the first AMP exhibiting antibacterial effectiveness against various Gram-positive bacteria in clinical uses [<xref rid="B5-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. AMPs are commonly amphiphilic and possess a high cationic nature. The physicochemical properties of AMPs play a crucial role in their antimicrobial activity. Certain AMPs show the ability to kill bacteria without affecting membrane integrity. These AMPs directly enter bacterial cells, disrupting crucial cellular functions, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, protein folding, and the process of cell division [<xref rid="B7-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The drug resistance to AMPs resulting from genetic mutations has a low probability due to the difficulty of cell membrane alteration and the versatile mechanisms of AMPs. Consequently, the development of drug resistance by bacteria is more difficult for AMPs compared to antibiotics [<xref rid="B8-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous peptides sourced from the marine environment have been isolated and proven to be promising compounds for drug candidates due to their unique molecular mechanisms of action [<xref rid="B9-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interestingly, the search for potential bacteria capable of producing antibiotics has transitioned from land-based strains to marine microorganisms. The high-stress and complicated marine environments, such as salt concentrations, pressure, temperature, oxygen concentrations, and radiation exposure, stimulate bacteria to produce compounds distinct from those found in terrestrial counterparts [<xref rid="B10-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>This research aimed to derive potential AMP-producing bacteria from mangrove sediment, along with their genomic information. The obtained AMP was purified and characterized before determining its antibacterial activity and chemical structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-antibiotics-13-00716"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-antibiotics-13-00716"><title>2.1. Exploration of Antimicrobial-Producing Bacterial Isolates from Mangrove Sediments</title><p>Sediment samples were collected from five different locations in the mangrove area in the Pak Banang district, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. The pH values of the sediments ranged from 6.26 to 8.00 and the salinity of the sediments ranged from 9.00 to 10.00 ppt. All colonies obtained from Mueller Hinton (MH) agar, Zobell Marine (ZM) agar, and Starch Casein (SC) agar were screened for anti-MRSA activity against MRSA strain 2468 using the soft agar overlay method. The isolates active against MRSA were verified by subculturing them in a liquid medium before collecting the cell-free supernatant (CFS). The spectrum of antibacterial activity was evaluated by agar well diffusion assay against various pathogenic bacteria, such as <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517 and MRSA strains 142, 1096, and 2468. Only four isolates from ZM agar exhibited antibacterial activity against different pathogens. It was observed that NNS4-5-2 isolate demonstrated antibacterial activity against MRSA but not against <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>. Nevertheless, three isolates (NNS2-1, NNS4-2, and NNS4-3) exhibited inhibitory effects against <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517, as well as MRSA strains 142, 1096, and 2468. Therefore, three isolates demonstrated antibacterial activity against both antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant strains of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>. Notably, the NNS4-3 isolate exhibited the greatest diameter of inhibition zone against MRSA strains compared to the other isolates. Its antibacterial activity against three strains of MRSA was superior to cefoxitin and comparable to vancomycin (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Consequently, this investigation focused on the antibacterial components produced by the NNS4-3 isolate to explore the significant findings of its genome and the antimicrobial active compound.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-antibiotics-13-00716"><title>2.2. Kinetics of Antibacterial Component Production of NNS4-3</title><p>The incubation of NNS4-3 was performed from 1 to 7 days and the growth curve was plotted by measuring the OD at 625 nm while the antibacterial activity was determined after collecting CFSs at each time interval. The maximum activity of CFSs derived from NNS4-3 was observed at 48 h with inhibition zones of 22.97 &#x000b1; 0.58, 21.45 &#x000b1; 0.78, and 21.87 &#x000b1; 0.38 mm against MRSA strains 142, 1096, and 2468, respectively. The inhibitory effect against <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517 was at its maximum at 72 h with an inhibition zone of 11.97 &#x000b1; 1.03 mm. However, a decrease in antibacterial activity against four strains of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> was observed from 48 h to 144 h of cultivation. The antibacterial activity disappeared when the incubation reached 168 h. The antibacterial components produced by NNS4-3 exhibited no significant difference in antibacterial activity against all MRSA strains at all time intervals (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

Purification of the Active Antibacterial Components</title><p>The crude product of antimicrobial components in the CFS of NNS4-3 was purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation and reversed-phase chromatography (RPC). Each fraction obtained from the purification steps was tested for antibacterial activity against MRSA strain 2468 using the agar well diffusion method. The CFS exhibited antibacterial activity against the MRSA strain 2468. The active precipitate was obtained at 75% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The collected precipitate was dissolved and desalted by dialysis in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The dialysate was further purified by RPC to confirm its antibacterial activity. The active RPC fraction eluted with 50% buffer B exhibited intense absorbance at 214 nm, indicating the presence of peptides (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a). The purification efficacy and molecular weight of the active fractions were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A single active band in Lane 1 indicated the effective purification process while Lanes 2 and 3 from ammonium sulfate precipitation and CFS, respectively, showed partial purification (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b). The electrophoresed gel showed an intense coomassie-blue-stained band between 5 and 10 kDa when compared to the protein marker in Lane M. To locate the active protein band, the other half of the gel was overlaid with MRSA strain 2468 soft agar and the clear zones revealed a molecular weight between 5 and 10 kDa (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c). The characterization of the protein band demonstrated that the purification procedure effectively concentrated the target protein and excluded other proteins, as indicated by the darkening of the active band and fading of others. The purification procedure was evaluated using a purification data sheet and the results showed a 22.65-fold increase in purification power compared to the initial crude extract with a 9.76% yield of the active peptide (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2.4. De Novo Amino Acid Sequence of the Purified AMP and Secondary Structure Determination</title><p>The purified NNS4-3 AMP from RPC was collected and subsequently subjected to amino acid sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. The de novo algorithm was used to predict the amino acid sequence from b-ion fragmentation. The molecular weight of the sequenced peptide was 1241.6768 Da (single protonated molecule in mass spectrogram reported 1242.72400 Da). The AMP was composed of 10 amino acid residues and sequenced as Lys-Leu-Leu-Lys-Asp-Leu-Phe-His-Asp-Asn with an average local confidence (ALC) score of 76% (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a). The prediction of the physicochemical properties of the peptide was performed by ProtParam on the Expasy server. The results revealed that the peptide had a theoretical pI of 6.75. The peptide contained positively charged amino acids due to two lysines and negatively charged amino acids due to two aspartic acids. The total net charge was +0.25 at pH 7.4. The grand average of hydropathy (GRAVY) value of the peptide was &#x02212;0.730, predicted by hydrophobic amino acids, which were leucine and phenylalanine, and hydrophilic amino acids, which were lysine, aspartic acid, histidine, and asparagine.</p><p>Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structure of the NNS4-3 AMP. The secondary structure of the AMP was studied when the AMP was dissolved in different solvents (purified water and 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate; SDS). Purified water was used as a solvent for studying the AMP secondary structure in its native conformation, whereas 50 mM SDS was used to form micelles for studying the interaction of the AMP, which simulates the negatively charged bacterial cell membrane environment [<xref rid="B11-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The CD results showed a high positive band at 190&#x02013;230 nm with a magnitude of 200 nm and a negative band at 205&#x02013;240 nm with a magnitude of 220 nm in both solvent systems. The results indicated that alpha-helix and beta-sheet conformations were found in the structure of the NNS4-3 AMP. When comparing the use of purified water and 50 mM SDS as solvents, the results showed that the positive band at 190&#x02013;230 nm decreased in magnitude, whereas the negative band at 205&#x02013;240 nm increased in magnitude when the AMP was dissolved in SDS. The change in magnitude indicated a transformation in the AMP structure to an alpha-helix conformation when dissolved in the SDS solution (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b). The components of the AMP secondary structure were calculated using CD spectra by the BeStSel web-based service. Different components of structural conformation were found when using purified water and 50 mM SDS solution as solvents. The AMP dissolved in purified water revealed that the major component, the beta-sheet conformation with an antiparallel direction, accounted for 58.1% while the alpha-helix conformation was 4.2% and the random coil conformation was 37.7%. In contrast, when the AMP was dissolved in 50 mM SDS, the major component of structural conformation changed to 46.7% of the alpha-helix conformation, along with 10.1% of random coil conformation, while the beta-sheet with the antiparallel direction was reduced to 43.1% (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>c). The component changes of AMP secondary structure when dissolved in 50 mM SDS suggested that the random coil conformation of the NNS4-3 AMP structure was converted to an alpha-helix conformation by the interaction of SDS micelles through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the AMP and the surface of SDS micelles. The amino acid arrangement of NNS4-3 AMP in an alpha-helix conformation was predicted by a helical wheel from the HELIQUEST web-based service. The predicted helical wheel showed three groups of amino acid arrangement, namely, positively charged, negatively charged, and hydrophobic areas (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>d). For more visualization of the 3D molecular surface area of NNS4-3 AMP, the secondary structure was predicted by PEP-FOLD4. The predicted molecular model of NNS4-3 AMP showed a polar region localized around the N-terminus and C-terminus, indicated by blue (positive electrostatic potential) and red (negative electrostatic potential) colors, while the hydrophobic region indicated by grey color was in the middle of the structure (<xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>e). The predicted 3D structure of NNS4-3 AMP was consistent with the helical wheel prediction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-antibiotics-13-00716"><title>2.5. Determination of the Antimicrobial Activity of NNS4-3 AMP by the Microdilution Method</title><p>The microdilution method was performed to determine the antibacterial activity of the purified AMP of NNS4-3 compared to the standard antibiotics. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were different between antibiotic-susceptible strains and resistant strains. <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517 was inhibited by 16 &#x000b5;g/mL. This concentration was 16-fold higher than the MIC value for three resistant strains (MRSA strains 142, 1096, and 2468) at 1 &#x000b5;g/mL. NNS4-3 AMP required 4-fold the amount of the MIC to exhibit the bactericidal effect against all tested strains. Vancomycin exhibited an inhibitory effect with a killing action because the MIC and MBC were equal.

The results indicated that the pathogens were sensitive to AMPs at 1&#x000d7; MIC at 18 h of incubation. <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517 showed cellular lysis when treated with cefoxitin, vancomycin, and NNS4-3 AMP. In the non-treatment condition, the cell membranes were intact with smooth surfaces and regular shapes. In contrast, MRSA strain 2468 showed good tolerance to cefoxitin treatment due to its resistant nature and that was similar to intact cell characteristics under non-treatment conditions. Vancomycin exhibited the potential to kill MRSA cells, as indicated by the irregular shape observed. The rupture of cell membranes indicated that the treated cells could not maintain their regular shape due to the interference with the D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety in cell wall synthesis by vancomycin. Interestingly, the antibacterial activity of NNS4-3 AMP resulted in the membrane disruption and pore formation that was indicated by the extrusion of the cytoplasm. The irregular shape of the treated cells and membrane damage, revealed by the rough surface of the cellular membrane, indicated the destabilization of cell membranes caused by AMPs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-antibiotics-13-00716"><title>2.7. Killing Kinetics of the AMP Isolated from NNS4-3</title><p>Time-kill kinetics is a crucial parameter for evaluating the efficacy and the mode of action of the AMP.

A significant reduction in survival cells was observed at 4 h of treatment compared to the non-treatment condition in both strains. The antimicrobial effect at the concentration of 1&#x000d7; MIC and 2&#x000d7; MIC against <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517 caused the survival cells to initially decline at 4 h and survival cells continued to decrease until 8 h of treatment. After that, the survival cell numbers slightly increased but the number of survival cells remained lower than the initial count until 24 h. The findings indicated that even after 24 h, NNS4-3 AMP at 1&#x000d7; MIC and 2&#x000d7; MIC did not completely kill <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517. The time-kill curve showed a log reduction rate of the survival cells at 1&#x000d7; MIC and 2&#x000d7; MIC of 0.028 and 0.061 logCFU/h, respectively. However, at a concentration of 4&#x000d7; MIC, the AMP continuously killed <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517 with the highest log reduction rate of 0.339 logCFU/h. In addition, the concentration at 4&#x000d7; MIC completely eradicated <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517 at 16 h of treatment. NNS4-3 AMP showed stronger inhibition to MRSA strain 2468 compared to <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517. The log reduction rates of MRSA strain 2468 treated with the AMP at the concentrations of 1&#x000d7; MIC, 2&#x000d7; MIC, and 4&#x000d7; MIC were 0.115, 0.190, and 0.757 logCFU/h, respectively.

The inhibitory concentrations were consistent with MIC and MBC determinations. The mode of action of AMP could be proposed in a concentration- and time-dependent manner against both pathogens.

Stability Determination of NNS4-3 AMP under Various Conditions: Temperature, Proteolytic Enzymes, Surfactants, and Acid-Base Treatment</title><p>The stability of the NNS4-3 AMP under various conditions is shown in <xref rid="antibiotics-13-00716-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Thermal stability studies revealed that the antibacterial activity of the AMP against MRSA strain 2468 was maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C for up to 12 h. The AMP retained its antibacterial activity at 60 &#x000b0;C for up to 6 h of incubation, whereas a significant reduction was observed at 12 h. The activities decreased to half potency when the temperature was above 80 &#x000b0;C after 6 h and 12 h of incubation. The antibacterial activity of the AMP decreased to approximately 73% when treated at 100 &#x000b0;C for 1 h and the activity completely diminished to 0% over subsequent incubation periods. For more thermal-stressed conditions, autoclaving was performed. AMP activity was reduced to 61% after autoclaving for 15 min. The activity of the AMP completely disappeared after autoclaving for 30 min. The tolerance of the AMP to proteolytic enzymes showed that NNS4-3 AMP resisted three different proteolytic enzymes (proteinase K, trypsin, and &#x003b1;-chymotrypsin) for up to 12 h of incubation. The results showed that the overall activity of the AMP was more than 90%. Surfactants above the critical micelle concentration were used in the experiment as the interferences of AMP activity. SDS and Triton X-100 affected the AMP activity differently. SDS, the ionic surfactant, reduced the antibacterial activity of the AMP; however, the non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 did not affect the activity of the AMP. A decrease in AMP activity after treatment with surfactants did not depend on the incubation time. There was no significant difference in the activity of the AMP incubated at different physiological pHs, including pHs 1.2, 4.5, 6.8, and 7.4, when compared to the non-treated sample, which was the AMP dissolved in purified water. However, the activity of the AMP decreased with increasing incubation time. The stability studies of the AMP revealed that it was tolerant of different environmental factors, maintaining more than 90% activity. However, temperatures exceeding 80 &#x000b0;C or exposure to an ionic surfactant should be considered for assessing the robustness of its activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot9-antibiotics-13-00716"><title>2.9.

Both AMPs shared a conserved amino acid sequence of Ile-Lys-Orn-Ile-Phe-His-Asp-Asn. This finding supported the relevance of the amino acid sequence of NNS4-3 AMP to the amino acid sequence of bacitracin. However, the limitation of mass spectrometry is its inability to distinguish between isoleucine (Ile) and leucine (Leu), which have the same molecular weight.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-antibiotics-13-00716"><title>3.

A total of 1286 <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus</italic> strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity have been reported, such as <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus subtilis</italic> (n = 348), <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> (n = 214), <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus licheniformis</italic> (n = 114), <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus circulans</italic> (n = 89), <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (n = 73), <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus pumilus</italic> (n = 61), <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus velezensis</italic> (n = 60), <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus megaterium</italic> (n = 17), <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus mojavensis</italic> (n = 17), and unidentified bacillus species (n = 293) [<xref rid="B24-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The reports on antimicrobial production by <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> are relatively low in number. The phylogenetic relation of NNS4-3 showed the closest relation to <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> KJ-16 based on genome comparison. <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> has been formerly identified as <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus licheniformis</italic>. Molecular genetics has confirmed the difference between both species since 2015. The difference between the two species relies on distinct operons that contribute to the BGC of secondary metabolites. A previous study has described the colony morphology of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> MDJK30 cultured in a casein medium. The colonies were beige in color with a dry-textured surface and irregularly shaped borders. It was a Gram-positive rod capable of forming endospores [<xref rid="B25-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

The colony and cell morphology of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> NNS4-3 were similar to those of the aforementioned strains.

This supports the evidence of divergence from the same ancestor. The bacillibactin BGC was predicted to have 100% similarity ortholog. Bacillibactin is synthesized by the <italic toggle="yes">dhb</italic> gene cluster. The detected operon, <italic toggle="yes">dhb</italic>ACEBF, was involved in the 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (dhb) biosynthesis pathway with a multi-enzyme complex that has been reported in <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> strain BP9 [<xref rid="B29-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Lichenysin has been reported in a previous study. Genome sequence analysis of several strains of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus licheniformis</italic> revealed the presence of <italic toggle="yes">lic</italic>A, <italic toggle="yes">lic</italic>B, <italic toggle="yes">lic</italic>C, and <italic toggle="yes">lic</italic>TE, which were responsible for lichenysin biosynthesis. The differences in the DNA sequence of these genes contributed to the difference in the carbon chain length of lichenysin [<xref rid="B30-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Fengycin was a non-ribosomal synthesized peptide that exhibited antifungal activity. The cluster contributing to the fengycin synthesis was composed of <italic toggle="yes">fen</italic>A-E genes, which have been found in the genomes of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus velezensis</italic> [<xref rid="B31-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The BGC of bacitracin found in the NNS4-3 genome has also been identified in <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus sonorensis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus thuringiensis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus cereus</italic>.

The bacitracin synthetase in <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus sonorensis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus thuringiensis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus cereus</italic> showed high similarity to genes for subpeptin synthesis from <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus subtilis</italic>, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of these genes might have occurred among these species.</p><p>The amino acid sequences of bacitracin synthetase across different strains exhibit sequence divergence but they share conserved substrate domains, indicating functional conservation of these enzymes [<xref rid="B25-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B32-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The self-resistance mechanism to bacitracin has been reported. The <italic toggle="yes">bac</italic>R and <italic toggle="yes">bac</italic>S genes regulate the bacitracin resistance along with the ABC transporter genes (<italic toggle="yes">bcr</italic>A, <italic toggle="yes">bcr</italic>B, and <italic toggle="yes">bcr</italic>C), which protect it against bacitracin damage during its production [<xref rid="B33-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The other BGCs, such as butirosin, schizokinen, and pulcherriminic acid, show low to moderate similarity in their orthologs (7&#x02013;75% similarity). Further investigation and verification of these BGCs and their functions are needed. The bacitracin-like AMP purified from NNS4-3 revealed a structure related to the familial structure of AMPs derived from <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus</italic> species. Bacitracin, lichenin, subpeptin, and subpeptin-like AMP have been reported to have similar amino acid sequences in the part of -Ile-Phe-His-Asp-Asn [<xref rid="B32-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B34-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. NNS4-3 AMP also contained the same conserved amino acid sequence as the aforementioned AMPs. However, mass spectrometry could not discriminate between the isoleucine and leucine amino acids. Therefore, the investigated AMP from NNS4-3 exhibited a 50% similarity to bacitracin. The BGCs for paralichenicidin and amyloliquecidin have been reported to be present in some strains of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic>. However, these BGCs were not found in the genome of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> NNS4-3. This indicated that the BGCs of secondary metabolites were diverse among subspecies [<xref rid="B25-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The further utilization of bacterial isolate as a component of the products in the healthcare industry requires an antibiotic susceptibility profile for safety data requirements, as regulated by the FDA. <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> NNS4-3 still exhibits high susceptibility to many antibiotics. In contrast, 24 strains of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> and 74 strains of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus licheniformis</italic> have been reported to resist erythromycin and clindamycin due to the presence of the <italic toggle="yes">erm</italic>D gene and <italic toggle="yes">spe</italic>G gene [<xref rid="B36-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Conversely, these two genes were not found in the in silico prediction of the NNS4-3 genome and susceptibility tests have confirmed its susceptibility to erythromycin. Regarding bacitracin resistance, almost all <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> strains possess these genes for self-defense during the production of bacitracin as a secondary metabolite for competitive situations in natural environments [<xref rid="B33-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Several antibiotic-resistance genes were found in the genome of NNS4-3, including genes encoding resistance to penicillin, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, and vancomycin. However, susceptibility testing verified that NNS4-3 was susceptible to those aforementioned antibiotics. The results were supported by previous studies. Nine strains of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> also exhibited a susceptible profile against the mentioned antibiotics [<xref rid="B37-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of NNS4-3 showed similarities with three strains of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus velezensis</italic>, which were susceptible to ciprofloxacin but resistant to cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone) [<xref rid="B39-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, NNS4-3 demonstrated resistance to ceftriaxone while it was susceptible to other cephalosporins. The antibiotic susceptibility of NNS4-3 was within acceptable limits for conventional treatment, indicating that this strain showed a low risk for pathogenicity. Previous studies have reported different MICs for bacitracin from <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic>. In the early stationary phase of the growth curve (48&#x02013;72 h of incubation), many <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus</italic> species produce the maximum potency of the antimicrobial peptide [<xref rid="B23-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The early stationary phase of NNS4-3 growth showed the maximum antimicrobial activity at 48 h. The purification procedures together with the bioassay guide provided the achievement of AMP purification. The antimicrobial peptide-producing <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus</italic> genus was supported by much of the reported literature [<xref rid="B24-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The MIC value of the purified AMP obtained from <italic toggle="yes">Penicillium sclerotiorum</italic> was 250 &#x003bc;g/mL for the methicillin-susceptible <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> (MSSA) strain SA1911 and 1911B and it was 125 &#x003bc;g/mL for the MRSA strain ATCC 35139 [<xref rid="B40-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In another study, the MIC value of bacitracin was 64 &#x003bc;g/mL in the MSSA strain RN4420 and 32 &#x003bc;g/mL in the MRSA strain MW2 [<xref rid="B41-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The literature search could support the observed difference in MIC between MSSA and MRSA strains. In our study, the MIC values of NNS4-3 AMP were different against MSSA and MRSA with lower MICs (1 &#x000b5;g/mL&#x02013;16 &#x000b5;g/mL) than those reported in previous works. Interestingly, MRSA strains were more susceptible to the NNS4-3 AMP than the MSSA strain.</p><p>The sensitivity of bacitracin derived from <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> UBBLi30 was studied against several conditions for 1 h. The stability result has been reported, showing that bacitracin was stable at up to 100 &#x000b0;C and across a wide range of pHs (1&#x02013;11) with 100% remaining activity. The activity was lost when the pH reached 14. Autoclaving for 15 min diminished the activity of the AMP to 80%. In addition, the AMP could resist digestion by proteolytic enzymes, such as proteinase K, trypsin, and pepsin [<xref rid="B42-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The NNS4-3 AMP showed similar stability against temperature treatment, proteolytic enzyme degradation, surfactant treatment, and pH variation to the reported bacitracin for 1 h of treatment. Moreover, our study extended the treatment duration to 6 and 12 h, which is longer compared to the previously reported study. The NNS4-3 AMP showed thermal resistance up to 80 &#x000b0;C and maintained robust activity across a wide range of physiological pHs for 12 h. Notably, temperatures above 80 &#x000b0;C for more than 6 h destroyed the peptide activity in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. Autoclaving reduced the activity of the NNS4-3 AMP by half within 15 min and all activity was diminished after 30 min. These thermal instability phenomena could be attributed to changes in the secondary structure of the AMP from alpha-helix and beta-sheet to a random-coiled structure due to denaturation. This structural change reduced the ability of AMP to destabilize bacterial membranes, resulting in a loss of antimicrobial activity [<xref rid="B43-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The NNS4-3 AMP exhibited tolerance to proteinase K, trypsin, and alpha-chymotrypsin. The AMP was composed of one phenylalanine residue as an aromatic amino acid and two lysine residues, which served as specific cleavage sites for proteinase K and alpha-chymotrypsin targeting the aromatic amino acid and trypsin targeting lysine, respectively [<xref rid="B44-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the activity of the AMP remained above 90% due to the short length of the peptide and its enantiomeric structure containing D-amino acids, which could not be cleaved by the aforementioned enzymes [<xref rid="B43-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Nonetheless, the mass spectrometry technique employed in our study was unable to determine the stereochemistry of the amino acid residues. The activity of NNS4-3 AMP could be reduced by SDS, whereas Triton X-100 did not affect the antibacterial activity of the AMP. Surfactants could form micelle structures above a critical micelle concentration and subsequently interact with lipid bilayers, such as bacterial cell membranes. The reduced activity of the NNS4-3 AMP in the presence of SDS could be proposed to occur due to the binding of the positively charged NNS4-3 AMP to the negatively charged micelles formed by SDS, which mimicked the interaction with intact bacterial cell membranes. This interaction was formed by electrostatic forces. Subsequently, hydrophobic interactions played a key role in facilitating the interaction of the hydrophobic part of the AMP with the bacterial cell membranes or SDS micelles. It could be proposed that the ability of the AMP to destabilize bacterial cell membranes caused cell disruption. In the SDS environment, the AMP could bind to SDS micelles instead of bacterial cell membranes; this reduced the availability of AMP molecules to interact with bacterial cells. Consequently, a reduction in AMP activity was observed in the presence of SDS. In contrast, the non-ionic micelles of Triton X-100 forming uncharged micelle surfaces had a lower impact on AMP binding. Therefore, AMP molecules would be able to fully interact with bacterial cells in the presence of Triton X-100 [<xref rid="B45-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms by which AMPs inhibit bacterial growth can be categorized into two types. The first is the receptor-mediated mechanism. Well-studied AMPs, like nisin and polymyxin, exert their activity by binding to lipid II and lipopolysaccharide on the bacterial cell wall, respectively [<xref rid="B46-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Likewise, bacitracin disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to lipid-P-P during the dephosphorylation of C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate [<xref rid="B47-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The second mechanism is non-receptor-mediated, which is more commonly reported for AMPs. The physical interaction plays an important role in the binding of cationic AMPs to the negatively charged surface of bacterial cell membranes due to the presence of phospholipids, teichoic acids, and lipopolysaccharides. The surfaces of Gram-positive bacteria, such as <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> and MRSA, contain teichoic acids, resulting in negatively charged cell membranes. This leads to an initial electrostatic attraction between the cationic AMPs and the bacterial cell membranes [<xref rid="B48-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. After the electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interactions between AMPs and bacterial cell membranes occur. This leads to the destabilization of the bacterial cell membrane and subsequent membrane disruption. This is the mechanism by which AMPs exert their antimicrobial activity [<xref rid="B11-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The well-defined models of molecular action for AMPs via the non-receptor-mediated mechanism are the barrel-stave, toroidal, and detergent-like carpet models, which have been described for alamethicin, lacticin Q, and aurein, respectively [<xref rid="B49-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. SEM micrographs revealed that the NNS4-3 AMP contributed to pore formation, cell membrane destabilization, and membrane breakdown, which were similar to the SEM images of vancomycin, which acts as a membrane-disrupting compound. These actions could be attributed to the 10-amino-acid length of the NNS4-3 AMP, which was composed of lysine, aspartic acid, and leucine residues in its structure. This resulted in cationic, anionic, and hydrophobic moieties, respectively. Additionally, the secondary structure of NNS4-3 AMP was confirmed by CD spectra. The beta-sheet conformation with an antiparallel direction plays an important role in pore formation on the bacterial membrane. A previous study reported the beta-sheet conformation with an antiparallel direction of synthetic AMPs facilitated penetration and pore formation on the cell membranes of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by physical interaction [<xref rid="B50-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Furthermore, the converted structure conformation from a random coil conformation to an alpha-helix conformation of the NNS4-3 AMP when interacting with SDS micelles supported its action on bacterial cell membranes [<xref rid="B51-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Another crucial aspect determining an antibiotic&#x02019;s effectiveness is its bactericidal rate, which refers to the rate at which it eliminates targeted bacteria. A faster bactericidal action typically leads to a quicker reduction in the bacterial load within the patient. This study suggested that at 4&#x000d7; MIC levels, the NNS4-3 AMP completely eradicated the <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> TISTR 517 within 16 h, while its bactericidal activity against the MRSA strain 2468 was observed within 8 h.</p><p>Killing kinetics revealed that the NNS4-3 AMP exhibited a mode of action with time- and concentration-dependent killing characteristics against the MSSA and MRSA strains. Most reported AMPs have been defined to exhibit modes of action that are dependent on both concentration and time. For alpha-helical cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as nisin and pleurocidin, their activity exhibits concentration dependence whereby a critical concentration is required to disrupt the cell membrane and cell wall of the treated bacteria via the previously described mechanisms. In addition to the concentration-dependent effect, AMP also exhibited a time-dependent killing effect, which involved slow pore formation on the bacterial cell membrane or the gradual accumulation of AMP to disrupt intracellular targets leading to cell death [<xref rid="B52-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-antibiotics-13-00716" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>The suggestion for further study is to determine the mechanisms of action at the molecular level of the NNS4-3 AMP. Verification of the predicted genes is encouraged to confirm the production process of the AMPs that were annotated in the genome, as they might contain low to moderate similarity to known orthologs. This potentially leads to the discovery of new gene products. <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> NNS4-3 could be a promising candidate as a source of AMPs against MRSA strains. Further evaluation of the AMP toxicity and safety is also required for clinical use. The insights obtained from its genomic information could support new approaches in synthetic biology to combat antimicrobial resistance.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-antibiotics-13-00716"><title>4.

The bacterial suspension was prepared to have a turbidity equivalent to 0.1 OD at 625 nm. The OD-adjusted bacterial suspension was used to prepare a 2% inoculum in 200 mL of ZM broth in a 1 L sterile Erlenmeyer flask. The 1 L total culture was incubated at 30 &#x000b0;C and 150 rpm for 48 h. The CFS was collected as described in the previous experiment. Ammonium sulfate at 25%, 50%, and 75% saturation levels were prepared by the stepwise addition of ammonium sulfate to the collected CFS. The precipitates from each saturation were collected by centrifugation at 18,000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> at 4 &#x000b0;C for 15 min. The collected precipitates were dissolved in 0.1% TFA in water before being desalted using a dialysis bag with a 3.5 kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane (SnakeSkin membrane, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The dialysis was performed in 0.1% TFA in water at 4 &#x000b0;C for 16 h. Each dialyzed fraction was tested for antibacterial activity using an agar well diffusion assay against the MRSA strain 2468. Subsequently, the fraction exhibiting antibacterial activity was subjected to RPC using an Inertsil ODS-3 C18 column (4.6 &#x000d7; 250 mm; GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) as a stationary phase. A gradient elution of mobile phase A (0.1% TFA in water) and mobile phase B (0.1% TFA in 70% acetonitrile; ACN) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min was used for the separation of the antibacterial components. The gradient elution was performed as follows: 0.0% mobile phase B for 25 min, 0.0% to 60% mobile phase B for 120 min, and 100% mobile phase B for 40 min. The peak was detected at 214 nm. Each fraction of 1 mL was collected from the chromatography and subsequently evaporated in a speed-drying vacuum concentrator (RVC 2-25 CDplus, Martin Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany). The dried components were dissolved in purified water to a volume of the same collected fraction and then tested for antibacterial activity using agar well diffusion assay against the MRSA strain 2468. The total volume of active fractions from each purification step was measured. The collected active fractions were dried by lyophilization (Gamma 2-16 LCSplus, Martin Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany) before their weights were determined. The dried components were reconstituted with sterile purified water to the same volume as the volume before drying. The reconstituted fractions were prepared at varying concentrations through 2-fold dilution and assessed for antibacterial activity using agar well diffusion assay against the MRSA strain 2468. The arbitrary activity of each active fraction was calculated by taking the final dilution to the power of 2 that showed an inhibition zone and multiplying it by 10.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-antibiotics-13-00716"><title>4.6.

Conclusions</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> NNS4-3 isolated from mangrove sediment could produce the bacitracin-like AMP against MRSA. The NNS4-3 AMP exhibited potent antimicrobial activity via cell membrane disruption. The NNS4-3 AMP was stable to proteolytic enzymes and surfactants and across a wide range of physiological pH conditions. However, the stability of NNS4-3 AMP against thermal conditions above 80 &#x000b0;C for longer than 1 h should be considered. The genomic information suggested that the findings of several BGCs for secondary metabolites could contribute to the discovery of new antimicrobial agents. The ARGs were found in the NNS4-3 genome but the antibiotic susceptibility test confirmed that this isolate was highly susceptible to various commonly used antibiotics. However, defining the mechanisms of action at the molecular level and evaluating the toxicity and safety of the AMP would require further in vitro and in vivo studies for antimicrobial effectiveness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge the Center of Scientific and Technological Equipment at Walailak University for the research facilities.
