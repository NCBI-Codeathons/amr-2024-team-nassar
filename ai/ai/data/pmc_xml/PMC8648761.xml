Correspondingly, antibiotic producer has canonically co-evolved this approach with the biosynthetic capability for self-resistance. Here we discover a self-defense strategy featuring with reductive inactivation of hemiaminal pharmacophore by short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) NapW and homW, which are integrated with the naphthyridinomycin biosynthetic pathway. We determine the crystal structure of NapW&#x000b7;NADPH complex and propose a catalytic mechanism by molecular dynamics simulation analysis. Additionally, a similar detoxification strategy is identified in the biosynthesis of saframycin A, another member of tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) antibiotics. Remarkably, similar SDRs are widely spread in bacteria and able to inactive other THIQ members including the clinical anticancer drug, ET-743. These findings not only fill in the missing intracellular events of temporal-spatial shielding mode for cryptic self-resistance during THIQs biosynthesis, but also exhibit a sophisticated damage-control in secondary metabolism and general immunity toward this family of antibiotics.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Antibiotic-producing organisms need to co-evolve self-protection mechanisms to avoid any damage to themselves caused by the antibiotic pharmacophore (the reactive part of the compound).

Many antibiotics contain hypersensitive and highly reactive pharmacophore, which is the basis for displaying biological activity as warhead. As a result, the producing-organisms have to co-evolve an effective self-protection scheme with the biosynthetic capability dealing with the dangerous warhead to avoid injuring themselves. Among the known self-resistance strategies, enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis is widely employed by bacteria to destroy the reactive pharmacophore in either antibiotic-resistant strain of pathogenic bacteria or antibiotic-producers. One of the well-known examples is &#x003b2;-lactamase-mediated hydrolytic deactivating of &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics, which not only widely spread in the pathogenic and environmental microbiome but also led to the development of &#x003b2;-lactamase inhibitors as next generation of drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Recently, different family of cyclopropane hydrolases were identified to catalyze hydrolysis of cyclopropane warhead, conferring self-resistance involved in yatakemycin (YTM)/CC-1065 and colibactin biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, continuous efforts on elucidation for different kinds of self-resistance mechanisms based on natural product biosynthesis will enrich our knowledge about enzyme-catalyzed inactivation of antibiotics, which may include the other enzyme-reactions acting on the pharmacophore beyond hydrolysis.</p><p id="Par4">Tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) antibiotics, with a special THIQ framework, have attracted continuous studies due to the complex polycyclic structures and excellent biological activities against bacteria and tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This family of natural products includes more than 60 members exemplified by naphthyridinomycin (NDM, <bold>1</bold>), saframycin S (SFM-S, <bold>5</bold>), ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743, <bold>7</bold>), lemonomycin (LMM, <bold>9</bold>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), and so on, in which ET-743 has been approved as an anticancer drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. As a family of DNA damaging genotoxins, THIQ antibiotics exhibit remarkably potent DNA alkylating activity through the departure of hydroxy group in hemiaminal moiety followed by an attack of N-2 of guanine in GC-rich region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

Here, we solved these mysteries by elucidating an intracellularly reductive inactivation of NDM catalyzed by NapW and homW, which belong to short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family encoded by genes <italic>napW</italic> within biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and <italic>homW</italic> outside BGC, respectively. We further demonstrated that expression of the genes endows bacteria with NDM-resistance and identified the key residue, Asp165, involved in NapW-catalytic reduction based on structural analysis. In this work, we found that similar self-resistance is involved in the biosynthesis of SFM; and this family of SDRs from other microorganisms could also recognize NDM and other three THIQ compounds to reductively inactivate the hemiaminal warhead. The substrate promiscuity of SDR proteins thereby not only provides the detoxification protection in cytoplasm during the biosynthetic pathway and general immunity toward THIQ antibiotics, but also expands the known enzymatic reactions for pharmacophore modification beyond hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>NapW and homW catalyzed reductive inactivation of NDM for self-resistance</title><p id="Par6">The oxidative reactions performed extracellularly by the secreted oxidase NapU occur at the late stage of the biosynthetic pathway, while, the chemical logic of formation of the inactivated intermediate <bold>12</bold> remains unclear. One functionally unassigned SDR encoded by <italic>napW</italic> in the BGC, NapW, attracts our attention, because the SDR family proteins could catalyze many different reactions including reduction of C=N bond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. To explore the function of NapW, we inactivated the <italic>napW</italic> gene by in-frame deletion and obtained the <italic>&#x00394;napW</italic> mutant <italic>Streptomyces lusitanus</italic> TG3022 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

This result suggested <italic>napW</italic> might not work in NDM biosynthesis or there should be other homologous gene to complete its function. Indeed, <italic>homW</italic> was found outside of the BGC by genome sequencing of NDM-producing bacteria, <italic>S. lusitanus</italic> NRRL 8034. HomW exhibits high sequence similarity (75% identity) with NapW and was speculated to play the same role as NapW. To verify the speculation, we knocked out <italic>homW</italic> gene in WT and TG3022 to acquire <italic>&#x00394;homW</italic> (TG3023) and <italic>&#x00394;napW&#x00026;&#x00394;homW</italic> (TG3024) mutants, respectively (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Given the fact that the proposed biosynthetic intermediate <bold>10</bold> or <bold>11</bold> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) is not available, we chose to employ <bold>1</bold> as the substrate to do the reduction assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In a previous work, we verified that secreted flavoprotein NapU catalyzed oxidative activation of inactive compound <bold>2</bold> to afford toxic product <bold>1</bold> extracellularly, as well as over-oxidative inactivation of <bold>1</bold> into <bold>3</bold> by controlling the concentration of <bold>1</bold> for self-protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Since <bold>1</bold> still exhibits the ability to diffuse into cells, we reasoned that NapW and homW should catalyze the inactivation of <bold>1</bold> to yield <bold>2</bold> for avoiding endogenous DNA alkylation. We firstly expressed two genes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified the two proteins (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>); then carried out NapU-catalyzed reaction to acquire unstable <bold>1</bold>, which is difficult to isolate by fermentation, and subsequently removed NapU by ultrafiltration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). When the purified recombinant NapW or homW was incubated with <bold>1</bold> in the presence of NADPH, the expected reduced compound <bold>2</bold> is effectively accumulated along with the disappearance of <bold>1</bold> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b&#x02013;II, III</xref>). When the cofactor NADPH is replaced by NADH, the enzymatic efficiency was dramatically decreased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b&#x02013;I</xref>). These results strongly demonstrate that NapW and homW functionally catalyze the reductive inactivation of the highly reactive iminium species, which implied that the two SDR proteins may participate in self-protection from endogenous DNA alkylation.</p><p id="Par8">To verify this assumption, we examined the relationship between these two genes and the self-resistance of the producer against NDM (<bold>1</bold>). Compared with the WT and single gene inactivation strain <italic>S. lusitanus</italic> TG3022 (&#x00394;<italic>napW</italic>) or TG3023 (&#x00394;<italic>homW</italic>), the double-deletion strain <italic>S. lusitanus</italic> TG3024 (&#x00394;<italic>napW&#x00026;</italic>&#x00394;<italic>homW</italic>) exhibited obviously increased sensitivity to NDM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), suggesting both <italic>napW</italic> and <italic>homW</italic> as NDM resistant determinants. Therefore, the expression of <italic>napW</italic> or <italic>homW</italic> can protect <italic>S. lusitanus</italic> from cytotoxic effect when NDM is biosynthesized. We next used <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells as test strain to estimate the resistance to NDM by overexpression of <italic>napW</italic> or <italic>homW</italic> in vivo. The survival ratio suggested that the recombinant strain is obviously resistant to NDM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Collectively, these results unambiguously supported our proposal that the SDRs NapW and homW axiomatically endow cells resistance to NDM for self-protection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Structure-based enzymology of NapW-catalyzed reaction</title><p id="Par9">To probe the molecular basis of the NapW/homW-mediated self-protection, we purified the NapW protein and determined its X-ray crystal structure at 2.1&#x02009;&#x000c5; resolution by molecular replacement method using the structure of human SDR family member one (PDB ID: 2QQ5) as searching model. The structure of NapW contains a typical Rossmann fold with seven &#x003b2; sheets embraced by &#x003b1; helices (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), which is the key feature of SDR family proteins for binding cofactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We further obtained the structure of NapW&#x000b7;NADP<sup>+</sup> binary complex by co-crystallizing NapW, NADP(H) and compound <bold>1</bold> or <bold>2</bold> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

The average distance was 3.91&#x02009;&#x000c5;, indicating the stable hydrogen bond existed indeed. To verify the function of residues Asp165, MD simulations were also performed for D165A mutant in NapW&#x000b7;NADPH&#x000b7;<bold>1</bold> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In the D165A mutant system, substrate <bold>1</bold> escaped from the catalytic center due to the loss of traction from Asp165.

As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, it was proposed that Asp165 could facilitate the transfer of proton from the carboxyl to the C-7 hydroxy, resulting in dehydration to form the electrophilic iminium species <bold>1</bold>&#x02032;, and then the hydride delivery from NADPH to <bold>1</bold>&#x02032; could generate the product <bold>2</bold>. To obtain the relative stable conformations for QM/MM calculations, two MD trajectories were extended to 150&#x02009;ns for sufficient sampling, and we chose the representative structure from the major cluster of the two trajectories as the initial structure to gain the reaction energy profile. Moreover, we found there was always water around O3 of <bold>1</bold> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Therefore, the computational model, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, consisted of NADPH, substrate <bold>1</bold>, Asp165, a water molecule, and other residues within 5&#x02009;&#x000c5; of NADPH and <bold>1</bold>. In the first step of dehydration, Asp165 protonated the hydroxyl of NDM to produce a water molecule with the energy barrier of 13.2&#x02009;kcal/mol (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d</xref>). After that, NADPH provided a proton to the intermediate <bold>1</bold>&#x02032; from the same direction as that of losing hydroxyl of <bold>1</bold>, generating the product <bold>2</bold> with the energy barrier of 22.2&#x02009;kcal/mol.

In addition, an UV-repair protein was considered as the second defense for the producer via nucleotide excision-based DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In fact, both of the canonical mechanisms are necessary but seem not completely competent to the task to guarantee the harmlessness during the whole biosynthetic process. Thereby another cryptic self-defense strategy was evolved by integrating with the pathway to ensure the survival of host during the biosynthetic process, which includes two key enzymatic steps via reduction-oxidation occurring at different timing and location (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In cytoplasm, SDRs (NapW/homW or SfmO1/homO1a/homO1b) will quench the reactive iminium intermediate immediately once it is generated by NRPS system via reduction of the C=N double bond to block the pharmacophore; which is a damage-control process because the resulted intermediates are totally harmless to the producer for deficiency of warhead. Subsequently, the matured but still inactivated intermediate <bold>2</bold> will be re-activated by secreted oxidase outside the host cells. Moreover, this secreted oxidase NapU could further oxidatively inactivate NDM into <bold>3</bold> to control the antibiotic concentration around the host cell (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Despite this, the high active NDM still could enter the host cell and cause potential harm to the producer; these SDRs thereby set up the firewall by reductive inactivation of it via pharmacophore quenching (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This redox-governed cycle avoided the self-cytotoxicity and guaranteed no antibiotic consumption. Beyond that, the SDRs also confer the host cells general immunity toward most of the THIQ antibiotics because all the members of this family employ the common hemiaminal pharmacophore for DNA alkylation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

Actually, enzyme-guided chemical modification of compound is one of the most widely existed strategies for antibiotic resistance including self-resistance involved in biosynthetic pathways. However, these modifications are usually limited by reversible group-transfer reactions acting on end-products, such as methylation, acylation, phosphorylation, glycosylation, amino-, or peptide-acylation and so on<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Rare cases employing reductive reaction include virginiamycin M1 reductase-catalyzed conversion of a ketone to alcohol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, a nitroreductase-mediated chloramphenicol inactivation and CytA-catalyzed dehydroxylation of cytorhodin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, as well as two recently-discovered fungal examples including a multistep reduction cascade in monasone naphthoquinone and a redox-cycle in A26771B biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Most of these modifications change the structure of antibiotics to prevent them from binding to the responding cellular target inside the cell rather than destroy the pharmacophore. This discovery of SDRs, functional as imine reductase, mediated reductive inactivation of hemiaminal pharmacophore without destruction of the THIQ skeleton structure, thereby added another enzymatic reaction in bacteria beyond the typical hydrolysis for warhead inactivation.</p><p id="Par18">Another significance of this self-resistance model in THIQ biosynthesis is the cryptically temporal and spatial shielding mode comprehensively integrated into the biosynthetic pathway. Antibiotic-producer usually evolved self-resistance strategy to deal with the final active compound; sometimes, analogs with similar structure could also be detoxified. Indeed, the SDRs encoded by the BGC and genome exhibit effectively reductive inactivation of THIQ antibiotics including NDM, SFM, ET-743, and LMM, which bear structural diversity despite belonging to the same family. Beyond that, enough amount of SDRs encoded by more than one copy of gene could also recognize the propeptide-linked intermediate, which led to completely blocking the pharmacophore and fundamentally destroying the warhead accompanied by the scaffold-formation. This modification step likely occurs at the early stage before tailoring modifications thereby resulting in the harmlessness of all the following metabolites in cytoplasm. Moreover, this reductive modification is also chemically favorable due to the improved stability of the resulted intermediate, which facilitates the biosynthetic steps. Thus, these SDRs not only confer general immunity toward natural occurring final THIQ antibiotics, but also play an important role in damage-control process during the entire biosynthetic route (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).
