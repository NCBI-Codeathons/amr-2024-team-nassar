Its biosynthesis uses a prodrug resistance mechanism: a non-toxic precursor assembled in the cytoplasm is activated after export to the periplasm. This activation is mediated by ClbP, an inner-membrane peptidase with an N-terminal periplasmic catalytic domain and a C-terminal three-helix transmembrane domain. Although the transmembrane domain is required for colibactin activation, its role in catalysis is unclear. Our structure of full-length ClbP bound to a product analog reveals an interdomain interface important for substrate binding and enzyme stability and interactions that explain the selectivity of ClbP for the <italic>N</italic>-acyl-<sc>d</sc>-asparagine prodrug motif. Based on structural and biochemical evidence, we propose that ClbP dimerizes to form an extended substrate-binding site that can accommodate a pseudodimeric precolibactin with its two terminal prodrug motifs in the two ClbP active sites, thus enabling the coordinated activation of both electrophilic warheads.</p><p id="Par2">

ClbP and its prodrug-activating peptidase homologs belong to the S12 family of serine hydrolases defined by conserved SxxK and YxN catalytic motifs and including class C &#x003b2;-lactamases, such as AmpC (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>). ClbP residues S95, K98 and Y186 are indispensable for enzymatic activity, and, in a crystal structure of the periplasmic domain, these residues converge to form the catalytic site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. ClbP cleaves precolibactin analogs with varied acyl chains and amide substituents but is highly specific toward the <sc>d</sc>-asparagine sidechain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the absence of substrate-bound structures, the mechanism underlying the substrate specificity of ClbP is not yet known. Compared to other S12 homologs, the ClbP periplasmic domain has distinguishing features, such as a broad substrate-binding site and a predominantly negative electrostatic surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, the isolated periplasmic domain is catalytically inactive, and, although only one TM helix is necessary for insertion into the inner membrane, all three are required for prodrug cleavage in colibactin biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">To investigate the role of the TMD in ClbP function and elucidate the structural basis of substrate specificity, we determined a crystal structure of full-length catalytically inactive S95A bound to a product analog. From this structure, we infer that the prodrug motif binds at the interface between the periplasmic and transmembrane domains, and TMD residues, especially W466, are crucial for peptidase activity in vitro. The <sc>d</sc>-asparagine sidechain in the prodrug motif hydrogen-bonds with S188 and N331, which are critical for peptidase activity in vitro. Changes to the hydrogen-bonding network which orients the N331 sidechain alter substrate specificity, demonstrating its importance for <sc>d</sc>-asparagine recognition. Crystal-packing interactions suggest that ClbP forms a dimer, and we confirmed this same dimeric species in solution using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the dimer, the two periplasmic domains form a canopy over the cell membrane under which the active sites face each other. We docked the proposed precolibactin structure onto the binding surface subtended by this canopy to illustrate that precolibactin can bind to ClbP with the two terminal prodrug motifs occupying the active sites of each subunit simultaneously. ClbP dimerization further supports the proposed pseudodimeric precolibactin structure and suggests a potential regulatory role in colibactin production and bioactivity: simultaneous activation of the two warheads may increase the probability that the toxin produced has two reactive sites capable of cross-linking DNA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The ClbP TMD extends the substrate-binding cleft</title><p id="Par9">To better understand the role of the ClbP TMD in enzymatic function, we determined the crystal structure of full-length ClbP embedded in a lipid mesophase. Seeking structures in the presence of substrate analogs, we initially focused on the catalytically inactive S95A variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Early S95A crystals yielded electron density maps that clearly showed the position of individual transmembrane helices, although their resolution was insufficient to assign the registry or helix connectivity pattern. To overcome this challenge, we mutated non-conserved TMD positions to methionine&#x02014;L454M and I478M&#x02014;and used anomalous diffraction data from selenomethionine-substituted crystals to locate these sequence markers in electron density maps. We obtained two high-resolution structures of S95A-L454M-I478M: selenomethionine-substituted ClbP and methionine-containing ClbP bound to a product analog (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The resulting high-quality maps allowed us to fully model the TMD helices and unambiguously assign their registry (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a,b</xref>). The two structures are nearly identical (root mean squared deviation (RMSD)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15&#x02009;&#x000c5; over the C&#x003b1; carbons of residues 38&#x02013;414 and 431&#x02013;491), except for the extent to which the TMD&#x02019;s intracellular loops are modeled; we base our analysis below on the higher-resolution product-bound structure. Our structure of wild-type ClbP presented in an accompanying paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> has an overall RMSD of 0.35&#x02009;&#x000c5; and 0.37&#x02009;&#x000c5; in the TMD (residues 382&#x02013;409 and 431&#x02013;491) to the unbound and product-bound structures, respectively, confirming that the introduced mutations do not affect the structure (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">In full-length ClbP, the interaction between the periplasmic and transmembrane domains extends the substrate-binding surface and orients the catalytic residues toward the cell membrane. The periplasmic domain sits atop the TMD, with most of its structure virtually identical to the previous isolated domain structure (RMSD 0.33&#x02009;&#x000c5; over 288 C&#x003b1; atoms; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). The TMD connects to the periplasmic domain through an 11-residue loop and consists of a three-helix bundle with TM3 in the center interacting with both TM1 and TM2 and no contacts between TM1 and TM2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The periplasmic TM2&#x02013;TM3 linker includes a two-turn helix that sits underneath the catalytic residues, whereas the cytoplasmic TM1&#x02013;TM2 linker is disordered and unresolved in our structures. F462 and W466 in the TM2&#x02013;TM3 linker protrude toward the catalytic residues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), forming an extended substrate-binding cleft as detailed below. The &#x003b2;3-&#x003b2;4 loop in the periplasmic domain (residues 218&#x02013;254) appears to dip into the membrane to interact with the TMD and is the only region that is different in the isolated periplasmic domain structure (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). The interactions of the &#x003b2;3-&#x003b2;4 loop with the TMD likely help orient the catalytic site toward the cell membrane, where precolibactin is presumably anchored by its two myristoyl chains. Specifically, K240 interacts with and satisfies the C-terminal negative dipole of the TM2&#x02013;TM3 linker helix, an interaction that may be particularly important in the hydrophobic membrane environment. F243 also contributes to this clasp, forming non-polar contacts with residues in TM1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">To investigate the sequence conservation of positions across the interdomain interface among candidate prodrug-activating peptidases, we searched the UniProt database for members of the PF00144 (&#x003b2;-lactamase) superfamily that had at least two transmembrane helices and were 400&#x02013;1,200 amino acids in length, consistent with similarity to either ClbP or the related prodrug-activating peptidase ZmaM (which contains an ABC half-transporter domain fused C-terminal to the ClbP-like peptidase). We built sequence similarity networks (SSNs) from protein sequences encoded by genes for which a genomic neighborhood of at least ten genes in either direction was available, using representative nodes at 100% identity to eliminate identical sequences and an expectation value cutoff of 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;90</sup>.

These homologs are mostly in Firmicutes but also in Proteobacteria (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), and their length is either ClbP-like (~450 amino acids) or ZmaM-like (~1,100 amino acids) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). These analyses also suggest that several Gram-positive <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> strains produce a compound highly similar to colibactin and that edeine biosynthesis employs an <italic>N</italic>-acyl-<sc>d</sc>-asparagine prodrug peptidase mechanism. This hypothesis is validated in an accompanying paper, in which a ClbP inhibitor stimulates accumulation of newly identified preedeines in a <italic>Brevibacillus</italic> strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Other SSN clusters were not part of gene clusters encoding NRPS machinery (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and are, therefore, unlikely to be involved in prodrug biosynthesis systems. We excluded sequences from these clusters from further analyses.</p><p id="Par12">In our alignment of 271 prodrug-activating peptidases, seven TMD residues are highly conserved (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). First, the two TM2&#x02013;TM3 linker residues facing the catalytic site are conserved&#x02014;W466 is strictly conserved, whereas neighboring F462 varies more, with substitutions to other hydrophobic residues and serine or threonine. W460 in the TM2&#x02013;TM3 linker is the only other strictly conserved TMD residue. Its sidechain is wedged between TM2 and TM3 under the TM2&#x02013;TM3 linker helix, with its indole amine group hydrogen-bonding to the L447 backbone carbonyl, buttressing a kink in TM2 at a conserved proline, P451 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Another conserved proline, P468, bridges the linker helix and TM3. The last two conserved TMD residues stabilize the interdomain interface: D381 caps the N-termini of helix &#x003b1;11 and TM1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), and D387 in TM1 hydrogen-bonds with two backbone amides of the &#x003b2;3-&#x003b2;4 loop hairpin turn (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

Conversely, the H257A mutation had little effect on peptidase activity, suggesting that the <sc>d</sc>-asparagine&#x02013;H257 interactions are less important for prodrug cleavage. Accordingly, the OH&#x02013;O angle between the S188 hydroxyl and the substrate&#x02019;s carbonyl acceptor is 175&#x000b0;, more optimal for hydrogen bonding than the 124&#x000b0; NH&#x02013;O angle formed with H257. Furthermore, position 257 is not conserved among prodrug-activating peptidases and predominantly corresponds to asparagine. A H257N substitution would likely place hydrogen-bonding groups too far to strongly interact with the substrate&#x02019;s <sc>d</sc>-asparagine sidechain carbonyl. The N331 sidechain carbonyl enforces substrate specificity by selecting for prodrug motifs containing <sc>d</sc>-amino acids with hydrogen-bond donors that can interact with it, explaining why ClbP does not cleave <sc>d</sc>-aspartate motifs. Accordingly, the E92Q mutation, which disrupts the interaction network that stabilizes and orients N331, substantially increased cleavage of a <sc>d</sc>-aspartate-containing substrate. Because E92Q also cleaves <sc>d</sc>-asparagine substrates at a wild-type-like rate, the E92Q mutation likely results in an N331 sidechain without preferential orientation that can either accept hydrogen bonds from the <sc>d</sc>-asparagine amide NH or donate hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate in <sc>d</sc>-aspartate.

Colibactin activation involves the formation of reactive electrophiles that must remain intact until they encounter DNA and produce the inter-strand cross-links that characterize colibactin toxicity. Dimeric ClbP could, thus, be important to simultaneously activate the two warheads and ensure that most of the colibactin produced has two active warheads.

Disrupting the ClbP dimer could potentially lead to the production of aberrant colibactins that are still genotoxic, albeit by inflicting different DNA lesions.

Peptidases involved in amicoumacin, edeine, paenilamicin, and zwittermicin biosynthesis cluster together, along with the newly identified probable Gram-positive colibactin producers. The Gammaproteobacterial ClbPs are split into two distinct subsets, one comprising close relatives of the sequences found in <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> and the other representing ClbPs from BGCs with canonical architecture in <italic>Escherichia</italic> species (with homologs from <italic>Erwinia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, <italic>Frischella</italic>, <italic>Gilliamella</italic>, and <italic>Serratia</italic> strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, among others). Similarly, AmiB homologs in <italic>Xenorhabdus</italic> strains cluster with XcnG sequences rather than Gram-positive AmiBs. Intriguingly, the genomes of some strains &#x02013; such as the edeine-producing <italic>B. formosus</italic> NF2 &#x02013; appear to have multiple biosynthetic gene clusters containing authentic prodrug peptidases with potentially distinct activities. <bold>b</bold>, SSN colored to highlight proximity (within a&#x02009;&#x000b1;10 gene neighborhood) of the peptidase gene to a gene containing both NRPS A and C domains, as a proxy for the presence of a NRPS module playing a ClbN-like role. The only SSN clusters in which this condition was met were clusters containing homologs of known prodrug peptidases (circled in black). All our sequence conservation analyses were performed using these clusters. <bold>c</bold>, SSN colored by phylum, highlighting that prodrug-activating peptidases are most common among Firmicutes, with some spread into Proteobacteria (as seen with the <italic>ami</italic>, <italic>clb</italic>, and <italic>xcn</italic> BGCs) and into Actinobacteria. <bold>d</bold>, The prodrug-activating peptidase SSN is colored by amino acid sequence length to emphasize that a large subset of sequences (including EdeA, PamJ, and ZmaM homologs) are much longer. This can be attributed to fusion with a second domain with homology to components of an ABC transporter, commonly annotated as a cyclic peptide transporter. However, Gram-positive AmiB and ClbP sequences (and other unidentified but related proteins) lack this additional domain and more closely resemble <italic>E. coli</italic> ClbP, <italic>X. bovenii</italic> AmiB, and XcnG. <bold>e</bold>, Sequence logos built from the alignment of 271 candidate prodrug-activating peptidases detail sequence conservation of the catalytic triad and of periplasmic-TMD interface and intra-TMD positions discussed in the main text.</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="41589_2022_1142_Fig5_ESM" id="d32e1800"/></fig>
