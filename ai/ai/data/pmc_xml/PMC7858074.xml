These Gram-negative <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> were originally classified as members of the genus <italic>Erwinia</italic> but were subsequently moved to <italic>Pantoea</italic> based on DNA hybridization experiments (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Although many <italic>Pantoea</italic> species are benign or beneficial plant mutualists, strains of <italic>P. ananatis</italic> are consistently associated with harmful crop and forest infestations (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Since 1983, the known hosts of <italic>P. ananatis</italic> have increased to 8 plant species in 11 countries, including important crops such as rice, corn, onions, melon, and pineapple (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Upon plant infection, these bacteria cause internal rotting, dieback, and blight, resulting in severe economic losses. In addition to primary infection in the field, significant postharvest losses, as observed in onion center rot, have also been reported (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Moreover, this plant pathogen can also infect humans and insects, which serve as vectors for plant infection (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Thus, there is a compelling need to understand <italic>P. ananatis</italic> pathogenesis to help address its epidemic spread among essential food crops.</p><p>Despite the economic and food safety implications of <italic>P. ananatis</italic> infection, the mechanisms of plant pathogenicity have only recently been investigated. Comparative genomic analyses revealed substantial diversity between <italic>P. ananatis</italic> strains, which may account for their ability to colonize and thrive in so many different hosts (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The pathogenicity determinants encoded by diverse <italic>P. ananatis</italic> genomes include quorum sensing systems, type VI secretion systems, motility factors, cell wall-degrading enzymes, and thiosulfinate resistance alleles (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In 2019, a novel pathogenicity determinant for onion center rot was revealed by comparison of the genomic sequences of two pathogenic and two nonpathogenic <italic>P. ananatis</italic> strains (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This approach identified a genomic island designated &#x0201c;HiVir,&#x0201d; which was subsequently shown to be present in 14 pathogenic strains and absent in 16 nonpathogenic strains using a PCR-based screen. The HiVir locus encodes an 11-gene operon (here, designated <italic>hvr</italic>) that was suggested to encode a biosynthetic pathway for an unknown phosphonic acid natural product based on the presence of a putative <italic>pepM</italic> gene. This gene encodes the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) phosphonomutase, which catalyzes the first step in all characterized phosphonate biosynthetic pathways and which has been extensively used as a genetic marker for the ability to produce phosphonic acid metabolites (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Deletion of <italic>pepM</italic> in <italic>P. ananatis</italic> OC5a resulted in a strain with severely attenuated pathogenicity in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Allium cepa</named-content> (onion), demonstrating a required role for the <italic>hvr</italic> operon in onion center rot. Based on this finding, Asselin et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) suggested that a small molecule phosphonate is involved in plant disease caused by <italic>P. ananatis</italic>.</p><p>Phosphonates, defined by the presence of chemically stable carbon-phosphorus bonds, are an underdeveloped class of bioactive molecules with significant applications in both medicine and agriculture. The bioactivity of these molecules results from their structural similarity to phosphate esters and carboxylic acids, which allows them to bind enzymes that act on analogous substrates, thus inhibiting enzyme activity. A prominent example is the manmade herbicide glyphosate, which was first synthesized by chemists in the 1950s. The phytotoxicity of glyphosate is due to its inhibition of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Significantly, enzyme inhibition by individual phosphonates is quite specific and typically confined to enzymes that act on chemically homologous substrates. Accordingly, a phosphonate can be toxic to one group of organisms while remaining innocuous to another. Thus, depending on the organism in which the target enzyme is found, phosphonates find applications as specific antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasital, and herbicidal compounds (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Given the ubiquitous occurrence of phosphate esters and carboxylic acids in metabolism, the range of potential biological targets for phosphonate inhibitors is vast. Indeed, as demonstrated by the number of organisms known to produce bioactive phosphonates, nature has often capitalized on this metabolic Achilles&#x02019; heel. Examples include phosphinothricin tripeptide and fosmidomycin, produced by members of the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, which have potent herbicidal and antimicrobial activity due to their inhibition of the essential enzymes glutamate synthase and deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, respectively (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Nature also makes use of the fact that the C-P bond is highly stable and resistant to both chemical and enzymatic degradation. Accordingly, many organisms replace labile biomolecules such as phospholipids and phosphate ester-modified exopolysaccharides with analogous phosphonates (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Considering their useful biological properties, it is not surprising that biosynthesis of phosphonate compounds is common among microbes. Based on the presence of <italic>pepM</italic> in sequenced genomes and metagenomes, ca. 5% of all bacteria possess the capacity for phosphonate biosynthesis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Biosynthetic gene clusters that include <italic>pepM</italic> are known to direct the biosynthesis of phosphonolipids, phosphonoglycans, and a wide variety of small-molecule secondary metabolites (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Like the streptomycete-derived natural products described above, many of these small-molecule phosphonates are bioactive. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the bioactivity and biosynthesis of small-molecule phosphonates, only a fraction of the observed <italic>pepM</italic>-encoding gene clusters have been characterized. Thus, the extent of phosphonate chemical diversity in nature has yet to be established.</p><p>Consistent with the idea that phosphonate biosynthesis is common in nature, it has also been observed that about 30% of sequenced bacterial genomes contain genes for phosphonate catabolism, which allows their use as sources of phosphorus, carbon or nitrogen (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Genes encoding the carbon-phosphorus (C-P) lyase system, which catalyzes a multistep phosphonate degradation pathway with broad substrate specificity, are particularly common in bacteria (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Other examples include the enzyme phosphonatase, which is specific for aminoethylphosphonate, and a recently characterized oxidative pathway for use of hydroxymethylphosphonate (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>Although the indirect evidence for the involvement of a bioactive phosphonate in <italic>P. ananatis</italic> pathogenesis is strong, this has yet to be established. Here, we show that the <italic>hvr</italic> operon indeed encodes enzymes responsible for production of a small-molecule phosphonate, which we show to be 2-[hydroxy(phosphono)methyl]maleate. The purified molecule, which we have designated pantaphos, has significant herbicidal activity and is able to produce the characteristic lesions of onion center rot in the absence of <italic>P. ananatis</italic>. Accordingly, this novel phosphonate natural product is both necessary and sufficient for onion rot pathogenesis. In addition, pathogenicity is enhanced in strains lacking phosphonate catabolism, suggesting that endogenous catabolism of pantaphos attenuates virulence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Phosphonate metabolism in <italic>P. ananatis</italic> isolates.</title><p>Although previous studies correlating the <italic>hvr</italic> gene cluster and onion pathogenicity examined 30 <italic>P. ananatis</italic> strains via PCR, only a few these had fully sequenced genomes at the time of the study (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). To expand our understanding of phosphonate metabolism in this species, we searched the currently available set of 65 <italic>P. ananatis</italic> genomes, which includes 6 from the previous study, for the presence of genes associated with phosphonate biosynthesis and catabolism (Data Set S1). Based on the presence of the <italic>pepM</italic> gene, 33 (51%) of these strains have the genetic capacity to produce phosphonate metabolites, with 26 strains encoding a single <italic>pepM</italic> and 7 containing two copies. Four different phosphonate biosynthetic gene clusters were identified, with the <italic>hvr</italic> operon being the most common (28 strains). Eight strains carry a seven-gene phosphonate biosynthetic locus that is unrelated to characterized <italic>pepM</italic> gene clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref>, cluster A). Four of these strains also possess the <italic>hvr</italic> locus at a distal site on the chromosome.

Because the pathogenicity of these strains has not been established, initial experiments were conducted to assess their ability to cause onion rot.

Spent media were then concentrated and screened for the presence of phosphonates using <sup>31</sup>P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which allows relatively sensitive detection of molecules containing a carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond, even in complex mixtures containing phosphate and phosphate esters (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In no case did we observe signals consistent with the presence of phosphonates. We suspected that our inability to detect phosphonates in spent media was due to poor expression of the <italic>hvr</italic> operon in the media we employed. Thus, we conducted similar experiments in media supplemented with onion extract, with the idea that a plant metabolite was required to induce expression of the <italic>hvr</italic> locus; however, we failed to detect phosphonates in these media as well.</p><p>To circumvent issues arising from native gene regulation, we constructed a strain that expresses the <italic>hvr</italic> operon from a strong, isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</xref>).

After growth of this recombinant strain in media with IPTG, three distinct <sup>31</sup>P NMR peaks were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>).

As with most phosphonate natural products, the pathway begins with the rearrangement of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) catalyzed by the enzyme PEP mutase (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In <italic>P. ananatis</italic>, this reaction would be catalyzed by the HvrA protein, which is highly homologous to known PEP mutases. Because the PEP mutase reaction is highly endergonic (&#x00394;G &#x0223c;125&#x02009;kJ/mol), subsequent steps must be highly favorable to drive net phosphonate synthesis (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In the proposed pathway, this thermodynamic driving force is provided by the exergonic condensation of acetyl-CoA and phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) catalyzed by the HvrC protein, which is a homolog of the biochemically characterized phosphonomethylmalate (PMM) synthase involved in FR-900098 biosynthesis (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). PMM would then be dehydrated to form 2-phosphonomethylmaleate by HvrD and HvrE. These proteins are homologs of the small and large subunits of isopropylmalate dehydratase, respectively, which catalyze the isomerization of 3-isopropylmalate to 2-isopropylmalate via a dehydrated intermediate (2-isopropylmaleate) during leucine biosynthesis. We expect that HvrDE will not catalyze the full reaction but, rather, will stop at the dehydrated intermediate. Precedent for this partial reaction is found in the propionate catabolic pathway of some bacteria, which catalyze the dehydration of 2-methylcitrate to 2-methyl-<italic>cis</italic>-aconitate using a member of the isopropylmalate dehydratase family (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Conversion of 2-phosphonomethylmaleate to pantaphos is likely to be catalyzed by HvrB, a homolog of the flavin-dependent monooxygenases, NtaA and ScmK (48% and 47% identity, respectively) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Consistent with the idea that this is an oxygen-dependent reaction, we have observed that poorly aerated cultures accumulate 2-phosphonomethylmaleate instead of pantaphos (data not shown). Flavin-dependent monooxygenases often require a separate flavin reductase to provide the electrons needed for reduction of oxygen to water. We propose that this function is provided by HvrK, a member of the flavin reductase family that is 30% identical to NtaB, which serves this function in the analogous NtaA-catalyzed reaction (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Finally, we suggest that the HvrI protein, which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily, is responsible for export of the phosphonate products (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Hvr biosynthetic gene cluster in <italic>P. ananatis</italic> LMG 5342 and the proposed biosynthetic pathway.

Considering the absence of nitrogen in pantaphos, a peptidic derivative could also help explain the presence of the putative <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase HvrG, which might act as a self-resistance gene similar to the <italic>pat</italic> gene that confers self-resistance during biosynthesis of phosphinothricin tripeptide (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Finally, the putative <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase HvrF is highly homologous to <italic>trans</italic>-acontitate methyltransferase, which is thought to be involved in resistance to the spontaneously formed <italic>trans</italic> isomer of this tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). An analogous role can be envisioned for HvrF if similar <italic>trans</italic> isomer side products are produced during pantaphos biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2.9"><title>Homologs of the <italic>hvr</italic> operon in other bacteria.</title><p>Asselin et al. noted the presence of gene clusters similar to the <italic>hvr</italic> operon in a number of bacterial genome sequences (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We felt it was worth revisiting this analysis in the light of the structures identified above. A total of 33 related gene clusters were identified in the NCBI genomic sequence databases using a combination of bioinformatics approaches. Based on the arrangement and the presence or absence of orthologous genes, nine types of Hvr-like biosynthetic gene clusters were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">Fig.&#x000a0;S6</xref>) Putative orthologs of HvrA-F are conserved in all of these groups, with the exception of type VIII, which replaces the HvrDE proteins with a putative aconitase. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>, aconitase catalyzes a reaction that is essentially identical to the putative HvrDE reaction. Thus, we predict that the biosynthetic pathway encoded by the type VIII <italic>hvr</italic>-like gene cluster has identical intermediates produced by paralogous enzymes. A feature that differentiates the nine types of <italic>hvr</italic>-like clusters is the presence or absence of one or more ATP-Grasp proteins, suggesting that a variety of peptidic derivatives of pantaphos might be produced in nature. However, type IX, which lacks ATP-Grasp family proteins, likely has very different structural modifications compared to the other types, based on the presence of homologs to several additional enzyme families. Finally, the clusters also differ with respect to their putative export proteins and the presence/absence of a putative flavin reductase. The latter is not unexpected, as many flavin-dependent enzymes can utilize generic reductases encoded by unlinked genes (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).

Indeed, our data show that application of purified pantaphos produces identical lesions in the absence of bacteria. Although bioactive phosphonate natural products are well known, data supporting a direct role for these molecules in pathogenesis are rare. To date, the sole known example is a complex phosphonate-modified polysaccharide produced by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides fragilis</named-content>, which was shown to promote abscess formation in the mammalian gut (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The demonstration that pantaphos is both necessary and sufficient for onion center rot adds a second phosphonate natural product to this short list and confirms the predicted function of the <italic>P. ananatis hvr</italic> locus proposed by Asselin et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Despite the fact that unmodified pantaphos is phytotoxic, it seems likely that modified derivatives of the compound are also produced by <italic>P. ananatis</italic>. As described above, the <italic>hvr</italic> locus encodes two ATP-Grasp proteins. Members of this protein family often catalyze the ATP-dependent formation of peptide bonds, including those found in the peptidic phosphonate natural products rhizocticin, plumbemycin, and phosphonoalamide (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Addition of amino acid substituents often enhances uptake of bioactive compounds. For example, phosphinothricin tripeptide is a potent antibacterial compound, while unmodified phosphinothricin has poor activity (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). It should be noted, however, that these transport-mediated effects are species specific. Thus, phosphinothricin and phosphinothricin tripeptide are equally effective herbicides (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). A particularly striking example of specificity conferred by amino acid substituents is seen in the bioactivity profile of rhizocticin and plumbemycin. These natural products have the same bioactive phosphonate warhead attached to different amino acids, which presumably governs their uptake by specific peptide transport systems. As a result, rhizocticin is a potent antifungal agent that lacks antibacterial activity, whereas plumbemycin is a potent antibacterial that lacks antifungal activity (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Based on these precedents, we suspect that peptidic derivatives of pantaphos may be produced during plant infection that increase its potency or specificity for a particular target species, perhaps accounting for the unstable compound 3 we observed in spent media.</p><p>Interestingly, pantaphos is not the only phosphonate produced by <italic>P. ananatis</italic> species. At least four distinct phosphonate biosynthetic gene clusters can be found in the currently sequenced <italic>P. ananatis</italic> genomes. With the exception of the <italic>hvr</italic> operon, neither the structures nor the biological functions of the molecules produced by these gene clusters can be suggested at this time; however, our data clearly show that the <italic>pgb</italic> cluster is not required for onion center rot. Significantly, the strict correlation between plant pathogenicity and the presence of the <italic>hvr</italic> operon breaks down when larger numbers of <italic>Pantoea</italic> genomes are analyzed. Accordingly, <italic>P. ananatis</italic> strains PA4 and PNA 14-1 lack the <italic>hvr</italic> operon but still cause onion rot, whereas strains PANS 04-2, PNA 07&#x02013;10, and PNA 200-7 carry the <italic>hvr</italic> locus but do not cause the disease. These data indicate that additional virulence traits are important for onion pathogenesis in <italic>Pantoea</italic> species. They also demonstrate the need for caution when using the presence/absence of the <italic>hvr</italic> cluster as a marker for plant pathogenicity.</p><p>Gene clusters similar to the <italic>hvr</italic> locus are relatively common in sequenced bacterial genomes; however, their phylogenetic distribution is rather restricted. Interestingly, many of the bacteria encoding these <italic>hvr</italic>-like gene clusters are associated with either plant or insect hosts. Homologs of the <italic>hvr</italic> operon are particularly abundant in members of the closely related <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> and <italic>Xenorhabdus</italic> genera. These bacteria have a unique lifestyle that relies on infection of an insect host via a nematode vector (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Similarly, an <italic>hvr</italic> locus is found in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bartonella senegalensis</named-content> OS02, a putative intracellular pathogen of mammals (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Given the cytotoxic effects we observed in human cells, it is tempting to suggest that pantaphos-like compounds may be involved in bacterial pathogenesis in both insects and humans. Homologs of the <italic>hvr</italic> operon are also seen in several members of the actinobacteria, including species of <italic>Streptomyces.</italic> These bacteria, which are common epiphytes and endophytes, are known for their production of a wide array of secondary metabolites, including antibacterial, antifungal, and phytotoxic compounds (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that bioactive pantaphos-like molecules are important for mutualistic interactions of actinobacteria as well.</p><p>The idea that pantaphos and its putative derivatives are involved in diverse mutualistic interactions begs the question of the biological target for these molecules. Among the organisms tested to date, only plants and human cells show significant sensitivity to pantaphos, while bacteria and fungi were completely insensitive to the molecule. A simple explanation for these observations is that the target is shared by plants and animals and absent from bacteria and fungi. Alternatively, the target could be shared by all organisms but be sufficiently different in bacteria and some fungi that it is not sensitive to the molecule. It is also possible that bacteria and some fungi share the ability to inactivate pantaphos or that they are incapable of transporting the molecule into their cells. Significant experimental effort, beyond the scope of this initial report, will be required to distinguish between these possibilities; however, at least for <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>, the data suggest that a lack of transport is not responsible for the absence of bioactivity. Possible targets for pantaphos can be envisioned based on the structure of pantaphos, which is similar to a number of common metabolites, including citrate, isocitrate, aconitate, isopropylmalate, and maleate. Because most characterized phosphonates act as molecular mimics of normal cellular metabolites, this suggests the possibility that pantaphos may target the TCA cycle or leucine biosynthesis. Because maleic acid compounds are known to inhibit transaminases, it is also possible that the molecule inhibits the synthesis of another essential amine-bearing metabolite (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the studies described here have significant agricultural implications, which provide strong motivation for future studies on the biosynthesis and molecular target of pantaphos, as well as potential mechanisms for resistance to the compound. The identification of pantaphos as the principal virulence factor in onion rot suggests multiple approaches to deal with agricultural infestations of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pantoea ananatis</named-content>. Because the molecule is required for virulence, it seems likely that inhibitors of the pantaphos biosynthetic pathway would prevent plant infection. It should also be possible to identify the molecular target of the compound in plants using purified or synthetic pantaphos, which would pave the way for development of crops with resistant alleles that would be immune to the disease. Plants expressing the putative pantaphos-modifying enzymes encoded by the <italic>hvr</italic> locus, or unrelated phosphonate catabolic genes, would also be expected to be specifically resistant to <italic>Pantoea</italic> infection. Finally, there is a desperate need to develop new treatments that are effective in combatting the alarming rise of herbicide-resistant weeds (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). The potent phytotoxicity of pantaphos suggests that it may have agricultural utility similar to that of the widely used phosphonate herbicides glyphosate and phosphinothricin. The real possibility of developing pantaphos-resistant crops strengthens this idea, as does the absence of bioactivity toward bacteria and fungi, suggesting that the molecule would have minimal effects on the soil microbiome. A note of caution is appropriate, however, given the moderate cytotoxicity we observed in human cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Bacteria, plasmids, and growth conditions.</title><p>The bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>.

Then, 1,200&#x02009;ml of 100% cold methanol was added for a final concentration of 75% methanol and incubated at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C overnight. Precipitated material was removed and saved using vacuum filtration with a Whatman grade 42 ashless filter, and the methanol-soluble fraction was dried to completion using initial rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying. The 48.0 g of dried material obtained by this process (sample A) was saved for further purification. The precipitated material saved from the above-described methanol extraction was subjected to a secondary 75% methanol extraction as described. Then the methanol-soluble fraction was dried to completion using initial rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying. The 1.60 g of dried material obtained by this process (sample B) was saved for further purification. Sample A was subjected to Fe<sup>3+</sup>-IMAC purification as follows: 10 g of Chelex resin (sodium form) was converted to the H<sup>+</sup> form by incubation in 1 M HCl for 30 min, followed by washing with 5 column volumes (CV) of water. Next, the resin was charged with Fe<sup>+3</sup> by resuspension in 100&#x02009;ml of 300-mM FeCl<sub>3</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O for 1&#x02009;h at 4&#x000b0;C followed by washing with 100&#x02009;ml of 0.1% acetic acid and incubation in 100&#x02009;ml of 0.1% acetic acid overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Sample A was acidified using concentrated acetic acid to pH 3 and incubated with the Fe-IMAC resin at 4&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;h. The solution was separated from the resin using a gravity column, and the flowthrough containing unbound phosphonic acids was saved (sample-flowthrough). Bound phosphonic acids were eluted from the Fe-IMAC resin using a gradient of 100&#x02009;ml NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (1, 5, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1,000&#x02009;mM), and fractions were collected and neutralized to neutral pH using acetic acid. The eight fractions were concentrated using initial rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying. Sample-flowthrough, containing any unbound phosphonic acids, obtained from the above-described process was combined with sample B and subjected to a second round of Fe-IMAC purification as described above. Fractions were concentrated using initial rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying. From each of the Fe-IMAC purifications, the fractions were combined in 2 to 3&#x02009;ml H<sub>2</sub>O as follows: the 500 to 1,000&#x02009;mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> fractions (sample 1), the 1 to 5&#x02009;mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> fractions (sample 2), and the 25 to 50, 100, or 250&#x02009;mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> fractions (sample 3). Samples 1, 2, and 3 were separately concentrated and dried via freeze-drying to obtain 45.1&#x02009;mg, 30.6&#x02009;mg, and 6.9&#x02009;mg of dried material, respectively. Quantitative phosphorus NMR, based on a 0.5-mM dimethylphosphinate standard reference, and purity assessment using proton NMR were performed for each sample. Samples 1 and 3 contained 0.551&#x02009;mmol and 0.215&#x02009;mmol phosphonate, respectively. However, sample 2 was found to contain only 0.0165&#x02009;mmol phosphonate and included residual phosphates not present in samples 1 and 3 and, therefore, was not used for further purification steps.</p><p>Sample 1 was subjected to further purification using a Teledyne ISCO CombiFlash RF+ UV-Vis system using a RediSep SAX anion exchange resin. Sample 1 was lyophilized and then reconstituted in 75% methanol. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, resuspended in 1&#x02009;ml of 100% D<sub>2</sub>O, and examined by <sup>31</sup>P-NMR. Samples containing residual phosphonates were subjected to additional cycles of drying and 75% methanol until all phosphonate compounds were solubilized. The methanol-soluble fractions were then pooled and subjected to CombiFlash purification. To do this, 5.7 g RediSep SAX column was equilibrated with 20 column volumes (CV) of 5% NH<sub>4</sub>OH in H<sub>2</sub>O, followed by 20 CV of H<sub>2</sub>O and then 20 CV of 90% methanol. A 1-ml sample from the methanol-soluble fractions was loaded onto the column via direct injection followed by 3.3&#x02009;min 100% A (90% methanol), linear gradient to 100% B (5% NH<sub>4</sub>OH in H<sub>2</sub>O) over 15&#x02009;min then 100% B for 6&#x02009;min, followed by 3.5&#x02009;min 100% A at an 18-ml/min flow rate. Fractions were monitored using UV 250&#x02009;nm and 210&#x02009;nm, and fractions showing absorbance at either wavelength were combined and analyzed by <sup>31</sup>P-NMR. Fractions containing the <italic>&#x003b4;<sub>P</sub></italic> 18 and 15&#x02009;ppm phosphorus chemical shifts were saved and dried via rotary evaporation followed by freeze-drying.</p><p>Sample 3 and the Combiflash-purified sample 1 were then subjected separately to high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification. Dried samples were reconstituted in 1&#x02009;ml H<sub>2</sub>O, and then 50 to 100 &#x003bc;l of sample was diluted in solvent B (90% acetonitrile&#x02009;+&#x02009;10&#x02009;mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 9.20) for a final concentration of 75% solvent B. Samples were then filtered through a 0.45-&#x003bc;m filter and purified using Atlantis HILIC Silica column (10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;250 mm<sup>2</sup>, 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m particle size) using gradient elution. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 4&#x02009;ml/min using H<sub>2</sub>O&#x02009;+&#x02009;10&#x02009;mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.50 (solvent A) and 90% acetonitrile&#x02009;+&#x02009;10&#x02009;mM NH<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> at pH 9.20 (solvent B). The gradient performed was as follows: 8&#x02009;min at 90% solvent B, followed by a linear gradient to 70% solvent B over 20&#x02009;min, then 50% solvent B over 1&#x02009;min, hold at 50% solvent B over 8&#x02009;min, and then back to 90% solvent B over 1&#x02009;min, followed by hold at 90% solvent B for 8&#x02009;min. Fractions were collected and monitored for UV absorption at 210 and 250&#x02009;nm. Fractions that absorbed at these wavelengths were combined and dried via rotary evaporation and analyzed using phosphorus NMR. Fractions were obtained that contained a pure phosphonate compound with a <italic>&#x003b4;<sub>P</sub></italic> 15&#x02009;ppm chemical shift (corresponding to pantaphos), and fractions were obtained containing a purified phosphonate compound with a <italic>&#x003b4;<sub>P</sub></italic> 18&#x02009;ppm chemical shift (corresponding to compound 2). Additional fractions were obtained that contained a mixture of pantaphos and compound 2. Purified compounds were dried and saved at 4&#x000b0;C for MS and NMR structural analyses as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4.9"><title>Onion bioactivity assays.</title><p>Yellow onions purchased form the local market were surface sterilized in a laminar flow biosafety hood as follows. First, the outermost layers with any damage or browning were removed and discarded, followed by soaking for 10 min in 10% bleach. The onions were then rinsed three times with sterile distilled water (dH<sub>2</sub>O), followed by soaking in 70% ethanol (EtOH) for an additional 10 min, and then rinsed four times with sterile dH<sub>2</sub>O. The onions were left in a biosafety laminar flow hood until the water and ethanol were completely evaporated. For testing the virulence of microbial strains, the onions were inoculated by stabbing with a previously sterilized wooden toothpick dipped into a bacterial cell suspension (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml in 1&#x000d7; phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] buffer). Chemical complementation studies were performed by the addition of 100 &#x003bc;l of filter-sterilized sample into the hole created by the toothpick during inoculation. For testing the bioactivity of crude and purified chemical samples in the absence of bacteria, holes were punched in sterilized onions using sterile toothpicks followed by addition of 100 &#x003bc;l of a filter-sterilized sample. Following inoculation and/or treatment with filter-sterilized compounds, the onions were placed in Ziplock plastic bags and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C in the dark for the indicated number of days. Following incubation, the onions were sectioned across the site of inoculation/sample application to allow visual inspection of the center rot phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4.10"><title>Mustard seedling bioactivity testing.</title><p>All seed preparation was performed in a laminar flow biosafety hood. Burpee tendergreen mustard seeds were cleaned as follows: 10% bleach for 1&#x02009;min, 3&#x000d7; rinse with sterile dH<sub>2</sub>O, 70% ethanol for 1&#x02009;min, followed by 5&#x000d7; rinse with sterile dH<sub>2</sub>O. Washed seeds were transferred to a sterilized paper towel and placed inside a sterile container. Then, 5&#x02009;ml of sterile tap water was added to the paper towel, and the container was incubated in the dark for 48&#x02009;h to allow the seeds to germinate. Germinated seedlings were transferred to 24-well cell culture plates containing 1&#x02009;ml of Murashige and Skoog agar (1% agar) per well. Then, 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of an appropriate dilution of the filter-sterilized compounds being tested were added to each well to achieve the desired concentration. For negative controls, 20 &#x003bc;l of sterile dH<sub>2</sub>O was spotted onto the agar. The 24-well plates were incubated in a humidity-controlled growth room with a 16&#x02009;h light cycle at 23&#x000b0;C for 1 week. Following incubation, plants were extracted from the growth agar by gentle pulling, which resulted in essentially agar free plants. Root length was measured immediately; dry weight was determined after drying for 24&#x02009;h at 150&#x000b0;C. Statistical analysis was performed for each condition to determine significance using the standard Welch&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test analysis from GraphPad Prism v8.4.1 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4.11"><title>Cell culture cytotoxicity screening.</title><p>The compounds were evaluated for their ability to kill cancer cell lines in culture, using HOS (osteosarcoma), ES-2 (ovarian cancer), HCT 116 (colon cancer), A549 (lung carcinoma), and A172 (glioma) cells.

The percentage death was determined by normalizing to water-treated cells and Raptinal-treated cells. For IC<sub>50</sub> determination, the data were plotted as compound concentration versus dead cell percentage and fitted to a logistic dose-response curve using OriginPro 2019 (OriginLab). The data were generated in triplicate, and IC<sub>50</sub> values are reported as the average of three separate experiments along with standard error of the mean SEM values.</p></sec><sec id="s4.12"><title>Antibacterial bioassays.</title><p>Susceptibility testing for the ESKAPE pathogens and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Salmonella enterica</named-content> LT2 was performed using a Kirby-Bauer method as outlined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). For rich medium bioassays, Mueller-Hinton broth 2 (MH-2; Sigma-Aldrich; 90922) was used for all strains except that 1% brain heart infusion (BHI) was supplemented for <named-content content-type="genus-species">Enterococcus faecalis</named-content> ATCC 19433. For minimal medium bioassays, glucose-MOPS minimal medium was used.
