In the biosynthesis of BS, leucylblasticidin S (LBS) was suggested as the penultimate metabolite with 20-fold less inhibitory activity than the final product BS. Incomplete conversion of LBS to BS at a variable efficiency ranging from 10% to 90% was observed either in the native strain <italic>S. griseochromogenes</italic> or a heterologous producer <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> WJ2. In this study, we determined that maturation of BS from LBS is not a spontaneous process but is governed by a standalone peptidase PepN, which hydrolyzes LBS in a pH-sensitive way with most appropriate of pH 7~8 but is inactive when the pH is below 5 or above 10. PepN1 and PepN2, two neighboring PepN homologs from <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> were purified in <italic>E. coli</italic> but displayed ca.100-fold difference in LBS hydrolytic activity. Overexpression of <italic>pepN1</italic> in WJ2 enhanced BS yield by 100% and lowered the ratio of LBS to BS from 2:1 to 2:3. This work presents the expansion of the biological role for PepN in antibiotic maturation and the first report of hydrolysis of beta amide linkage by this conserved enzyme.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Blasticidin S (BS) is a nucleoside analog consisting of a cytosine linked to a dideoxyhexose and bonded to a modified arginine.

There have been two groups of BS resistance genes reported in non-BS producers. The first group featured by BSD or BSR encodes blasticidin S deaminase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> that converts BS to non-toxic deaminohydroxyblasticidin S.

In some fungi, two groups of resistance genes are present to convert BS to N-acetyldeaminohydroxyblasticidin S<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Impermeability of the cell membrane constitutes another barrier to delivery of BS to its intracellular targets. But some nutrient uptake systems could be hijacked for BS delivery, such as an ABC transporter named NppA1A2BCD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and the leucine-rich repeat-containing 8(LRRC8) proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> in mammalian cells.</p><p>In studies of blasticidin S, demethylblasticidin S (DBS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and leucylblasticidin S (LBS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> were isolated as the intermediates in the broth of <italic>S. griseochromogenes</italic> when the pH of the culture medium was kept below 4.

SCC 1785 and <italic>S. griseochromogenes</italic> under the normal laboratory conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Addition of leucine to C-13 of the beta-amino group of BS was expected as a new self-resistance mechanism because the antibiotic activity of LBS against indicator strain <italic>Bacillus circulans</italic> was decreased by 20 folds compared to BS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. LBS was suggested as the direct precursor for BS biosynthesis as the washed cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> or cell lysate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> of <italic>S. griseochromogenes</italic> can convert LBS into BS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). It is of particular interest to know where this conversion occurs to avoid self-destruction of the host by the generated BS, as well as identifying the protein responsible for this hydrolysis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we determined that PepN from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> can catalyze the hydrolysis of LBS into BS. The activity of PepN is pH-dependent wherein it shows the highest hydrolytic activity at pH 7&#x02013;8 and loses its activity when pH is below 5 or above 10. The variation in the ratio between LBS to BS in the fermentation broth of <italic>S. lividans</italic> is attributed to the changes in activity of PepN that is affected by the medium pH in different fermentations.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>LBS and BS productivity is significantly affected by fermentation conditions</title><p>The blasticidin S native producer <italic>Streptomyces griseochromogenes</italic> has a very strong barrier system against introduction of foreign DNA. Heterologous expression of the BS biosynthetic gene cluster in <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> initially only yielded LBS, but not BS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. As the published BS gene cluster contains nine putatively unrelated genes upstream of <italic>blsS</italic> but stops at <italic>blsN</italic>, immediately downstream of essential gene <italic>blsM</italic>, we speculated that there might exist a peptidase gene downstream of <italic>blsM</italic> and thus cloned 8780-bp sequences (Accession number is JX244070) after <italic>blsN</italic> through chromosomal walking. We engrafted the expanded BS biosynthetic gene cluster onto <italic>S. lividans</italic> to generate WJ2, which is able to produce BS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. We then conjectured that the 8780-bp sequence might encode the putative LBS peptidase gene.</p><p><italic>blsN</italic>, <italic>bls-1</italic> and <italic>bls-2</italic> were then independently knocked out in <italic>S. lividans</italic> WJ2, and analysis of the metabolites and biological activity assay of three mutants revealed no difference from strain WJ2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A,B</xref>), implying they are not peptidase genes or there exist multiple peptidase gene(s) elsewhere. Unexpectedly, we observed that all these mutants as well as WJ2 can produce LBS in addition to BS. The ratio between LBS to BS varied from 2:9 to 9:1 in different fermentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). It therefore raised two possibilities with respect to the maturation of BS from LBS: i) a LBS hydrolase gene locates outside of BS gene cluster and its activity is significantly affected by the fermentation condition; ii) LBS hydrolysis is a spontaneous process that is greatly affected by fermentation conditions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Many non-BS producing cells can hydrolyze LBS into BS</title><p>The washed cells of <italic>S. griseochromogenes</italic>, the BS native producer, were reported to hydrolyze LBS into BS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.

Surprisingly, the cells of both strains are capable of hydrolyzing LBS to BS in similar effective way.

The cell free extracts of these strains were all found to possess LBS hydrolytic activity as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, the boiled CFE of <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B cannot perform this process, demonstrating that LBS hydrolysis is not a spontaneous process and that there is a conserved hydrolase gene in charge of the maturation of LBS into active BS.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of PepN in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> as the peptidase involved in LBS hydrolysis</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, the most studied bacterium, displayed relatively high efficiency in LBS hydrolysis and was thus chosen as the start strain to clone LBS hydrolase gene. The CFE of <italic>E. coli</italic> were precipitated with different concentration of ammonium sulfate wherein the fraction precipitated by 40% (V/V) ammonium sulfate displayed high catalytic activity, and further subjected to sequential separation on HiTrap Q HP (GE Healthcare, 5&#x02009;ml) and on MonoQ HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare). The eluate fractions from No.15 till No.19 showed LBS hydrolysis activity. These fractions and the inactive fraction No. 14 were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. There are some comparatively thicker bands in the most active No.16 fraction, such as bands of approximate 95&#x02009;kD and 66&#x02009;kD (indicated by arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The fractions of No.14 and No.16 were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for their protein compositions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). 296 specific proteins were identified in the fraction of No.16 wherein the five most abundant peptidases were chosen as the candidates for the LBS hydrolase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The five peptidase genes were then disrupted in <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113, an <italic>E. coli</italic> derivative facilitating homologous recombination between linear DNA fragment and chromosome.

Only the <italic>pepN</italic> mutant lost all LBS hydrolytic activity while the other four mutants retained the same efficacy in LBS hydrolysis as the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). This result demonstrates that PepN is responsible for LBS hydrolysis in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> activities of PepNs from <italic>S. lividans</italic> WJ2 and <italic>E. coli</italic> are affected by pH variation</title><p><italic>PepN</italic> homologs are widespread in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and may function as the LBS hydrolase in various strains. Two closely located PepN homologs from <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> were identified through blast search; PepN1 is 27% identical (114/427) and 42% positive (180/427), and PepN2 is 26% identical (91/346) and 42% positive (146/346) to PepN, respectively. We thus expressed and purified PepN, PepN1 and PepN2 <italic>in E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) to assay their LBS hydrolysis activity (Left panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure.S3</xref>). PepN and PepN1 exhibited similar LBS hydrolyzing efficiency which is at least 100-fold higher than that for PepN2 (Right panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The transcription level of <italic>pepN1</italic> is comparable to that of <italic>blsD</italic> as well as constitutively expressed <italic>hrdB</italic>, but is at least 3 folds higher than that of <italic>pepN2</italic> in <italic>S. lividans</italic> WJ2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), therefore PepN1 is the major LBS hydrolase in <italic>S. lividans</italic> WJ2 during fermentation.</p><p>As in different fermentations, the proportion of LBS in the final metabolites varies, implying that PepN activity is affected by the changing medium conditions, particularly the pH value as it was affected very much by cell contamination or sterilizations process. PepN and PepN1 were then measured for their activity in hydrolysis of LBS at pH ranging from 5 to 9. PepN and PepN1 behave similarly at the same pH, and the pattern change of activity are also similar, namely with most appropriate pH for <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction at 7.5 and least activity above 10 or below 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). These observation are consistent with that pH variation in the fermentation broth affected the LBS hydrolase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>) and thus determined the proportion of LBS to BS in the final metabolites.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Overexpression of PepN1 in <italic>S. lividans</italic> WJ2 to improve the yield of BS</title><p>As LBS is 20-fold less active than the final product BS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <italic>in vivo</italic> conversion of LBS to BS by overexpression of <italic>pepN1</italic> in <italic>S. lividans</italic> WJ2 is desired. <italic>pepN1</italic> under the control of constitutive expression promoter P<italic>ermE*</italic> were constructed and introduced into WJ2 to generate mutant strains <italic>S. lividans</italic> YGY6. The ratio of BS to LBS yield in the YGY6 is 3:2 as compared to that of 1:2 in WJ2::pIB139, the absolute yield of BS increased 100% upon the overexpression of PepN1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).These results demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>pepN1</italic> is an efficient way to enhance BS production.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Removal of the leucyl group from Leucylblasticidin S was proposed as the final step in BS biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Heterologous expression of blasticidin S biosynthetic gene cluster in <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> occasionally produces the mixture of LBS and BS. It remains a puzzle whether the LBS hydrolysis is a spontaneous process or the LBS hydrolase gene is included in the published BS biosynthetic gene cluster or locates elsewhere on the chromosome. In the process to clone the possible LBS hydrolase gene, we observed that CFE of some none-BS producers can efficiently covert LBS to BS whereas the boiled CFE of these strains cannot perform this process, demonstrating that LBS is not a spontaneous process and LBS hydrolase gene is outside of BS gene cluster. Hence, the published BS biosynthetic gene cluster actually encodes all essential proteins for LBS rather than BS. BS is now widely used commercially as a selection reagent in transgenic studies due to its higher inhibition activity than LBS, thus the study on the maturation mechanism for LBS into BS is of great application value.</p><p>We here report the identification of PepN as the LBS hydrolase by tracking the LBS hydrolytic activity in the CFE of <italic>E. coli</italic> and confirmed that PepN is the sole peptidase of <italic>E. coli</italic> to cleave the leucine from the beta-amino group of arginine. PepN in <italic>E. coli</italic> is a major aminopeptidase that is involved in downstream protein processing during cytosolic protein degradation and has a preference to cleave basic and small amino acids in an ATP-independent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. It is well conserved in all life kingdoms. Now that PepN1 and PepN2 were present and expressed in <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic>, it is odd that WJ2 sometimes produces LBS at a ratio to BS as high as 9:1, but in some cases as low as 2:9, indicating that the fermentations conditions either affect the expression level of PepNs or the catalytic efficiency of PepNs in LBS hydrolysis. LBS was previously isolated when the fermentation broth was kept below pH 4 but later studies revealed it is unnecessary. This study again suggested that pH might plays an important role in regulation of the activity of PepNs. Consistent with this assessment is that the yield of BS is highest when the fermentation broth was kept at pH 8 as compared to lowest yield at pH 5. This finding provides a good way to promote the conversion of LBS into BS <italic>in vivo</italic> by simply adjusting the fermentation broth to pH 8. Given the above data, the possibility that pH plays a role in regulation of expression level of PepN <italic>in vivo</italic> could not be excluded.</p><p>An important concern on LBS hydrolysis is the location of where PepN acts on the substrate LBS. In the proposed pathway for BS biosynthesis, leucine is first loaded to the beta-amino group of L-arginine to form demethylleucylblasticidin S (LDBS), followed by methylation of the guanidino group to generate LBS. LDBS and LBS are both easily converted to DBS and BS by whole cells or the CFE of BS producer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Thus, PepNs is unlikely to be co-localized with the enzyme forming LDBS, otherwise there could be a futile cycle of adding and removing leucine in the final steps of BS biosynthesis. Because analysis using HMMTOP (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/index.php">http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/index.php</ext-link>) revealed that PepNs has a short transmembrane region spanning from residues 384 to 401 and because, washed cells are capable of converting LBS and LDBS into BS and DBS, respectively, PepNs may be membrane-associated with its catalytic domain exposed to the cell exterior. The proposal is that LBS is formed within the cytoplasm either for self-protection or to facilitate export out of the cell where it is then hydrolyzed by PepNs that is anchored on the cell surface.</p><p>As PepN in <italic>E. coli</italic> is the major aminopeptidase that is responsible for the majority activity of aminopeptidase and is implicated in cytosolic protein degradation. This study showed that PepN is also capable of cleaving the amido bond between the carboxyl group of leucine and the beta-amino group of arginine that is bonded to the 4&#x02019;-amino group of hexose ring of blasticidin S. It might also play a role in processing other secondary metabolites harboring moiety of amino acid or peptides.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditions</title><p>Strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material.
