Here, we show that trees up to 600 y of age display similar leaf areas, leaf photosynthetic efficiencies, and seed germination rates. Transcriptomic analysis indicates that the vascular cambium of the oldest trees, although undergoing less xylem generation, exhibits no evidence of senescence; rather, extensive expression of genes associated with preformed and inducible defenses likely contributes to the remarkable longevity of this species.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Aging is a universal property of multicellular organisms. Although some tree species can live for centuries or millennia, the molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying their longevity are unclear. To address this, we investigated age-related changes in the vascular cambium from 15- to 667-y-old <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> trees. The ring width decreased sharply during the first 100 to 200 y, with only a slight change after 200 y of age, accompanied by decreasing numbers of cambial cell layers. In contrast, average basal area increment (BAI) continuously increased with aging, showing that the lateral meristem can retain indeterminacy in old trees. The indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentration in cambial cells decreased with age, whereas the content of abscisic acid (ABA) increased significantly. In addition, cell division-, cell expansion-, and differentiation-related genes exhibited significantly lower expression in old trees, especially miR166 and HD-ZIP III interaction networks involved in cambial activity. Disease resistance-associated genes retained high expression in old trees, along with genes associated with synthesis of preformed protective secondary metabolites. Comprehensive evaluation of the expression of genes related to autophagy, senescence, and age-related miRNAs, together with analysis of leaf photosynthetic efficiencies and seed germination rates, demonstrated that the old trees are still in a healthy, mature state, and senescence is not manifested at the whole-plant level. Taken together, our results reveal that long-lived trees have evolved compensatory mechanisms to maintain a balance between growth and aging processes. This involves continued cambial divisions, high expression of resistance-associated genes, and continued synthetic capacity of preformed protective secondary metabolites.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>cambium</kwd><kwd><italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic></kwd><kwd>old trees</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">31530084</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Li Wang</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Biao Jin</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Jinxing Lin</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">31670695</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Li Wang</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Biao Jin</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Jinxing Lin</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs3"><funding-source id="sp3">National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">31670181</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Li Wang</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Biao Jin</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Jinxing Lin</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs4"><funding-source id="sp4">Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities</funding-source><award-id rid="sp4">111 project</award-id><award-id rid="sp4">B13007</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Jinxing Lin</principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">Aging occurs in most multicellular organisms, and in yeast and animal cells is frequently accompanied by telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, and somatic mutations. However, in plants, aging is complex and multifactorial and is regulated by both genetic and environmental factors (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Aging is associated with deterioration of growth and differentiation as well as with maturity, whereas senescence, which ends in death, is the last developmental stage (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Programmed cell death and leaf senescence at the cellular and organ/tissue levels have been extensively studied (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, due to the complex life cycles of plants, evolutionary theories of aging have somewhat been neglected in the plant kingdom, and thus the mechanisms underlying aging at the whole-plant level remain enigmatic.</p><p>In animal cells, the age-related decline in cell/tissue function usually correlates with a reduction in stem cell activity. Similarly, plant meristems are critical for many aspects of growth and development. Almost all postembryonic production of plant tissues is the result of cell proliferation and differentiation from meristems. Maintenance of meristem activity results in some woody and herbaceous perennials living for many years. In woody plants, the apical meristem in the tree top is usually damaged by natural stresses (e.g., freezing injury, lightning strikes, or fracture by wind) in old trees. However, the vascular cambium (VC) meristem, a continuous cylinder of meristematic cells in the stem, is viable throughout the lifespan of the tree, producing secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Compared with young trees, old trees are characterized by a later onset of xylogenesis, a shorter growing season, and a lower growth rate, resulting in a smaller number of xylem cells (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), suggesting that cambial meristem activity is related to age in woody plants. Nevertheless, how aging is manifested in cambial meristems of long-lived trees remains unknown.</p><p>Due to their large size, relatively slow growth rate, and long generation time, classical genetic screening of long-lived trees is difficult. The development of sequencing technologies, including RNA, sRNA, and degradome sequencing, has now made it possible to test the involvement of thousands of genes in a biological process. In this study, we assessed the effect of aging on a long-lived tree by investigating variations of vascular cambial properties in mature and old <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> trees at the cytological, physiological, and molecular levels. Cambial activity, hormone levels, resistance gene expression, and autophagy were determined according to tree age. Furthermore, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory networks were analyzed. This study provides insights into how the old trees keep the capacity of growing through a balance between growth and aging processes and may serve as a reference for further studies of the extended lifespans of long-lived trees.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>Radial Growth Patterns and Anatomical Changes in Cambial Cells.</title><p>Generally, woody plants exhibit variations in morphology as they become mature and older. We took tree-ring cores of 34 female trees of different ages with an increment borer and analyzed the tree rings using dendrochronological procedures. The diameters at breast height (DBHs) of these trees were 11.5 to 450 cm and the ring widths became thinner with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). For example, the average tree ring width of a 25-y-old tree (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1916548117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic></ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1916548117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S1</ext-link>, sample 4) was 5.25 mm, while that of a 991-y-old tree (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1916548117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S1</ext-link>, sample 33) was about 1.20 mm. Similarly, in one 143-y-old tree (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1916548117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S1</ext-link>, sample 20), the ring width in the year 1885 CE was 7.37 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>, blue point), whereas in 1981 CE it was 1.67 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>, red point). Through tree-ring analysis combined with the DBH, we determined that the ages of the sampled trees ranged from 15 to 1,353 y (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1916548117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S1</ext-link>). The average increment of ring width in the first 10 y was 50.47 &#x000b1; 24.70 mm. From 100 y to 200 y, the increment decreased to an average of 15.89 &#x000b1; 4.45 mm. In trees over 200 y of age, the mean increment of ring width was about 14.84 &#x000b1; 3.95 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Although ring widths declined with age, we could not evaluate the trend of age-related growth decline by ring width alone. Therefore, we further calculated the basal area increment (BAI) every 10 y, and found that the stem BAI still maintained a high level in old trees, even up to 510 y old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). The bark thickness of a young tree was about 0.5 cm while that of an old tree was up to 2.5 cm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1916548117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>).

Frequently, mature woody trees cannot increase their height after a certain age mainly because the shoot apical meristem of old trees is usually damaged by natural stresses (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The vascular cambium, on the other hand, can ensure both increased tree girth and annual renewal of vascular tissues over a tree&#x02019;s lifespan, thus most mature trees are increasing in girth and production of branches, but are no longer getting taller (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Our comparative analysis revealed that the number of cambial cell layers gradually decreased from VC20 to VC600. In parallel, the ring widths decreased dramatically in the first 200 y, and more slowly during the next few hundred years. Although the ring widths decreased in old trees, it is noteworthy that the BAI did not show a declining trend from 10- to 600-y-old <italic>G. biloba</italic> trees.

Ally et al. (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) found that the reduction with age in the number of viable pollen grains in <italic>Populus tremuloides</italic> suggested that old clonal trees would lose sexual function with respect to pollen quantity and quality between &#x0223c;500 and 20,000 y. We found that, 20-, 200-, and 600-y-old trees displayed similar leaf areas, leaf photosynthetic efficiencies, and seed germination rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>), in contrast to previous reports of decreased growth rates and reproductive capacity during aging (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Moreover, in old male <italic>G. biloba</italic> trees, there is no significant decline in male fertility with age, and male trees over 1,000 y old still maintain high pollen productivity and viability (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Similarly, many 1,000-y-old <italic>G. biloba</italic> female trees can produce a large number of seeds every year in China (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We propose that continuous growth of the cambial cells may enable <italic>G. biloba</italic> to escape senescence at the whole-plant level.</p><p>Senescence, comprising the final stage of development during the aging process, is generally accompanied by massive changes in the transcriptome. Previously, two plant-specific transcription factor families WRKY and NAC were found to be major regulators of senescence in plants and, at the posttranscriptional level, miR164 and miR319 can control leaf senescence through targeting ORE1 and TCP, respectively (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Here, we found that some senescence-associated genes of the WRKY, NAC, and MYB families were not differentially expressed with age among the different <italic>G. biloba</italic> trees. Moreover, expression of almost all of the senescence/age-related miRNAs, including miR164, miR319, miR172, and miR156, and their targets did not show changes with age. In particular, the transcript levels of several autophagy-related genes did not decline with age. Based on the fact that there was no consistently higher expression of senescence-related genes in old trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7 <italic>C</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>), we conclude that the old tree of <italic>G. biloba</italic> is in a healthy mature state and senescence is not manifested at the whole-plant level.</p><p>Perennial plants need to cope with changing environments and pathogens over their lifespans, and some may die due to biotic and environmental stresses such as bark beetles and intense drought (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Thus, ability to defend against biotic and abiotic stress is a major contributor to successful long life in perennial trees. There are 62 members of the FLS2 and EF-Tu receptor (EFR) resistance gene families in <italic>G. biloba</italic>, considerably higher than the number reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). By RNA sequencing, we found transcripts corresponding to 457 R genes in <italic>G. biloba</italic> trees of different ages; of these, 220 NBS-LRR genes and 15 FLS2 genes showed no obvious expression difference between young and old trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7 <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). Thus, this long-lived perennial appears to maintain resistance to external stress via the persistent expression of a large number of R genes.</p><p>Xylem formation usually is characterized by the activation of metabolic pathways which lead to the formation of the phenolic polymer lignin to make the trees dense in support of increasing size. Trees also produce antimicrobial and antioxidant secondary metabolites, such as flavonoid glycosides and terpenoids, in response to stresses (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). For example, pinoresinol is one of the structurally simplest lignans, frequently present in woody plants as a defensive agent due to its antihelminthic and antifungal activity (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and many stilbenoids and flavonoids have been isolated from heartwood and bark of many trees. The ratio of heartwood/sapwood increased with age in <italic>G. biloba</italic>, and the expression of monolignol and flavonoid/stilbene pathway genes was not significantly reduced in old trees. Thus, accumulated protective specialized metabolites from continuous growth may enhance the resistance of long-lived old trees to adapt themselves to different environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s9"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p content-type="flushleft">Acquisition and preservation of cambium material, average BAI analysis, plant hormone analysis, and qRT-PCR followed protocols in previous publications (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).
