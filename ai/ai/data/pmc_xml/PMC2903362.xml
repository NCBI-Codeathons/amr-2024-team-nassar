This provides an effective self-defense mechanism, preventing any fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A formed from being further metabolized to 4-hydroxy-<italic>trans</italic>-aconitate, a lethal inhibitor of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Remarkably, FlK does not accept acetyl-coenzyme A as a substrate. Crystal structure analysis shows that FlK forms a dimer, in which each subunit adopts a hot dog fold as observed for type II thioesterases. Unlike other type II thioesterases, which invariably utilize either an aspartate or a glutamate as catalytic base, we show by site-directed mutagenesis and crystallography that FlK employs a catalytic triad composed of Thr<sup>42</sup>, His<sup>76</sup>, and a water molecule, analogous to the Ser/Cys-His-acid triad of type I thioesterases. Structural comparison of FlK complexed with various substrate analogues suggests that the interaction between the fluorine of the substrate and the side chain of Arg<sup>120</sup> located opposite to the catalytic triad is essential for correct coordination of the substrate at the active site and therefore accounts for the substrate specificity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acetyl-Coenzyme A</kwd><kwd>Bacterial Metabolism</kwd><kwd>Coenzyme A</kwd><kwd>Crystal Structure</kwd><kwd>Enzyme Mechanisms</kwd><kwd>Protein Structure</kwd><kwd>Site-directed Mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>Fluoroacetyl-Coenzyme A</kwd><kwd>Thioesterase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 1986, Sanada <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) discovered that <italic>Streptomyces cattleya</italic> is able to produce fluoroacetate (FAc)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN8"><sup>8</sup></xref> from fluoride. Attempts to elucidate the mechanism of this unusual transformation have led to the discovery of a fluorinase enzyme catalyzing the formation of 5&#x02032;-fluoro-5&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine from <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine and fluoride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We have cloned the fluorinase gene <italic>flA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and subsequently identified a gene cluster (<italic>fl</italic>) surrounding the fluorinase gene from <italic>S. cattleya</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Characterization of the 5&#x02032;-fluoro-5&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine phosphorylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), the enzyme responsible for the second step of the FAc biosynthesis encoded by the <italic>flB</italic> gene located next to the <italic>flA</italic>, has confirmed the involvement of the <italic>fl</italic> gene cluster in the biosynthesis of FAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In our efforts to further elucidate the functions of the <italic>fl</italic> gene cluster, the protein encoded by the <italic>flK</italic> gene located close to the 3&#x02032;-end of the cluster was characterized as a thioesterase that cleaves fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A (FAcCoA) to produce FAc and CoA. It is noteworthy that acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) is not hydrolyzed by FlK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Previous studies have shown that FAc can be used by AcCoA synthase to synthesize FAcCoA, and citrate synthase can catalyze formation of 2-fluorocitrate from FAcCoA and oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Lauble <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) have shown that the (&#x02212;)-<italic>erythro</italic> diastereomer of 2-fluorocitrate is further converted to 4-hydroxy-<italic>trans</italic>-aconitate, a lethal competitive inhibitor of aconitase, thereby blocking the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The presence of a FAcCoA-hydrolyzing enzyme that has no effect on the metabolically important intermediate AcCoA may therefore serve as a self-resistance mechanism for the FAc-producing <italic>S. cattleya</italic>.</p><p>FlK is homologous to many predicted thioesterases and hypothetical proteins according to protein-protein BLAST searches against a non-redundant protein sequence data base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, none of these putative homologues has a defined function. Two groups of thioesterases have been identified, thioesterases I and thioesterases II, based on differences in their amino acid sequence, protein folds, and catalytic mechanisms. Type I thioesterases have evolved within the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-hydrolase fold superfamily and are usually present as a product-releasing domain of multidomain proteins, such as type I fatty acid synthases, polyketide synthases, and nonribosomal peptide synthases. Type I thioesterases use serine or cysteine as the catalytic residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Type II thioesterases are discrete proteins associated with activities of hydrolyzing short- or medium-chain acyl-CoAs and exist either as a homodimer of a single hot dog fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) or as a monomer comprising a duplicated hot dog fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It has been shown that the active sites of type II thioesterase enzymes contain either a glutamate or an aspartate residue acting as a general base or nucleophile responsible for the catalytic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), although the precise catalytic mechanism has remained controversial. FlK, a discrete protein catalyzing hydrolysis of a short-chain acyl-CoA (fluoroacetyl CoA), apparently belongs to the type II thioesterase family and is therefore expected to have a carboxylic side chain at the active site. Protein sequence alignment analysis has revealed that nine amino acid residues in FlK (Gly<sup>8</sup>, Thr<sup>42</sup>, Glu<sup>50</sup>, Leu<sup>61</sup>, Gly<sup>69</sup>, His<sup>76</sup>, Ala<sup>78</sup>, Gly<sup>83</sup>, and Gly<sup>116</sup>) are all conserved in homologues that have a similar protein size to FlK (ranging from 127 to 180 amino acids). The presence of Thr<sup>42</sup> and His<sup>76</sup> together with Glu<sup>50</sup> among the conserved residues led us to speculate that FlK may employ a variation of the classical catalytic triad-type mechanism with Thr<sup>42</sup> (instead of a Ser or a Cys), His<sup>76</sup>, and Glu<sup>50</sup> (instead of an Asp). His<sup>76</sup> would then serve as a base to deprotonate Thr<sup>42</sup>. The deprotonated Thr<sup>42</sup>-O<sub>&#x003b3;1</sub> is proposed to act as a nucleophile attacking the fluoroacetyl carbonyl carbon of FAcCoA to initiate the hydrolysis reaction and the carboxylic side chain of Glu<sup>50</sup> to neutralize the charge developed on the His<sup>76</sup> side chain during the transition state of the reaction by hydrogen bonding with the imidazole nitrogen of His<sup>76</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Although a hydroxyl derived from threonine rather than from a serine residue has been found to act as the catalytic nucleophile in some proteinases, including the individual activities of the proteosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), to the best of our knowledge, no functionally characterized thioesterase has been reported to use threonine in this way.</p><p>We have carried out site-directed mutagenesis targeting the putative catalytic residues and defined structures by x-ray crystallography of the wild type and mutant FlK proteins both with and without bound analogues of FAcCoA. Our studies provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of FlK and the high substrate specificity of FlK for FAcCoA over the closely related AcCoA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cells, Reagents, and Equipment</title><p>All oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by MWG-Biotech.

To assess the involvement of these residues in the catalytic mechanism, the activities of the mutants were assayed and compared with that of WtFlK. Four mutants of the FlK protein carrying single amino acid mutations (T42S, T42A, E50A, and H76D, respectively) were cloned in pET28a(+) and overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta<sup>TM</sup> (DE3)pLysS cells as His-tagged proteins. All proteins were purified by Co<sup>2+</sup>-charged His-Bind resin (Novagen) followed by gel filtration. Both WtFlK and T42SFlK were expressed as soluble proteins with a yield of over 10 mg from 1 liter of culture. T42AFlK and E50AFlK mutants yielded only 2 mg of soluble enzyme/liter of culture, although their expression levels were comparable with those of WtFlK and T42SFlK. During storage at 4 &#x000b0;C T42SFlK and T42AFlK also showed a much higher tendency to aggregate than WtFlK. The recombinant H76DFlK protein expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> was completely insoluble, so it was not used for further studies. All of the mutations seemed have disturbed protein folding, with the H76D mutant being the most affected. The molecular weights of the purified proteins were determined by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Retention times on gel filtration through a Superdex S200 column indicate that purified WtFlK and the T42AFlK, T42SFlK, and E50AFlK mutants are all dimers.</p><p>The enzymatic characterization of WtFlK using FAcCoA as substrate has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The present study demonstrated that replacing the Thr42 with Ala<sup>42</sup> in FlK abolishes the enzyme activity, supporting our hypothesis that the Thr<sup>42</sup>-O<sub>&#x003b3;1</sub> may act as the catalytic nucleophile that attacks the carbonyl thioester carbon of FAcCoA to initiate the hydrolysis reaction. Not surprisingly, T42SFlK is still able to hydrolyze FAcCoA with a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value of 27.3 m<sc>m</sc><sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is about 19 times higher than that for WtFlK (1.47 m<sc>m</sc><sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and a relatively smaller <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value (15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, 50% lower than that for WtFlK (30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>)). It is noteworthy that T42SFlK activity was inhibited at a substrate concentration above 12 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>. These results suggest that the Ser<sup>42</sup>-O&#x003b3; in T42SFlK is able to carry out the nucleophilic attack and that the absence of the Thr<sup>42</sup>-C&#x003b3; in the T42S mutant may have led to decreased ability to ensure correct substrate binding, resulting in the substrate inhibition. The <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value of E50AFlK (0.54 m<sc>m</sc><sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is only 37% of that for WtFlK, whereas the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> (206 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) is much higher than that for WtFlK. E50AFlK also exhibited substrate inhibition when the FAcCoA concentration was above 19 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, suggesting that Glu<sup>50</sup> plays an important role in substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of wild-type and mutant FlK</bold></p><p>Enzyme reactions were carried out using FAcCoA as the substrate.

The WtFlK structures were solved in the apo-form and in complex with either the substrate analogue AcCoA or the substrate fragment analogues FAcCPan and FAcOPan, the product FAc, or the product analogue Ac. Although attempts to crystallize T42S and T42A mutants in their apo-forms failed, crystals of T42SFlK in complex with Ac, FAc, or AcCoA and T42AFlK with bound FAc were obtained, and their structures were solved.</p></sec><sec><title>Overall Fold and Oligomeric Association of FlK</title><p>The crystals of FlK diffracted at resolutions between 2.35 and 1.5 &#x0212b; and belong to space group C2 or P2<sub>1</sub> with two, four, or eight FlK molecules in the asymmetric unit, depending on the nature of the complex. Those complexes that crystallized in C2 (WtFlK&#x000b7;Ac, WtFlK&#x000b7;FAc, T42SFlK&#x000b7;Ac, T42SFlK&#x000b7;FAc, and T42AFlK&#x000b7;FAc) have a dimer in the asymmetric unit with a local 2-fold symmetry axis. The crystals in P2<sub>1</sub> have either dimers (two in T42SFlK&#x000b7;AcCoA and apo-SeMet WtFlK) in the asymmetric unit, also with local 2-fold symmetry, or two tetramers (WtFlK&#x000b7;FAcCPan and WtFlK&#x000b7;FAcOPan) with orthogonal 2-fold axes giving 222 pseudosymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). Operation of the crystallographic 2-fold axis on the dimers in the asymmetric unit in space group C2 generates a tetramer, identical to that observed in the WtFlK&#x000b7;FAcPan or WtFlK&#x000b7;FAcOPan crystal structures. The observation that these crystal structures contain discrete tetramers suggests that the protein may have dimer-tetramer equilibrium in solution in which tetramers predominate at high concentrations.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Overall structure of FlK depicted in a schematic representation.</bold> <italic>A</italic>, structure of WtFlK dimer.

The hot dog fold was first observed for the structure of &#x003b2;-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydratase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). A diverse range of enzymes with distinct catalytic activities has been found to have this fold. Thioesterases are important members of the hot dog superfamily and include 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterases from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. CBS-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and from <italic>Arthrobacter</italic> sp. SU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> thioesterases II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and acyl-CoA thioesterases YciA from <italic>Hemophilus influenzae</italic> (HI0827) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Despite the conserved hot dog fold, these thioesterases share a very low degree of identity at amino acid sequence level. The FlK asymmetric unit contains a dimer with pseudosymmetry about a 2-fold axis as observed previously in the structure of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). and (<italic>R</italic>)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase from <italic>Aeromonas caviae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Most other thioesterases with the hot dog fold form tetramers, although hexameric structures have also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The main contacts between the two protomers in the FlK dimer are through strand 2 (residues 70&#x02013;76) of the two protomers. The &#x003b2;-strands of the two protomers form together a 10-strand &#x003b2;-sheet with the putative active site at the interface between the protomers. A disulfide bond formed by their respective Cys<sup>73</sup> residues covalently connects the two subunits. Wrapping around the disulfide bond are the Ile<sup>72</sup> and the Val<sup>74</sup> from both protomers with their side chains within hydrophobic interaction distance of each other. The C<sub>&#x003b3;2</sub> of the putative catalytic Thr<sup>42</sup> also makes a hydrophobic contact with Ile<sup>72</sup>-C<sub>&#x003b3;2</sub> of the partner protomer. All of these interactions contribute to bringing the two protomers together. Furthermore, there are two salt bridges formed between the two protomers; the Lys<sup>21</sup>-N<sub>&#x003b6;</sub> interacts with the Glu<sup>29</sup>-O<sub>&#x003f5;2</sub>, and Lys<sup>135</sup>-N<sub>&#x003b6;</sub> interacts with the carboxyl O<sub>&#x003b4;2</sub> groups of Asp<sup>111</sup> and Asp<sup>108</sup> in the partner protomer. Hydrogen bonds formed by Ser<sup>30</sup>-O<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> and Glu<sup>32</sup>-O<sub>&#x003f5;1</sub> with Trp<sup>51</sup>-N<sub>&#x003f5;1</sub>, Gly<sup>43</sup>-N with Glu<sup>50</sup>-O<sub>&#x003f5;2</sub> through a water molecule, and Tyr<sup>27</sup>-OH with Phe<sup>44</sup>-O also serve to stabilize the FlK dimer. The contact area between two protomers is &#x0223c;1750 &#x0212b;<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to 30% of the accessible surface area of each protomer, suggesting strong interactions between them. These observations have led us to assume that the minimal active unit of FlK is a dimer.</p><p>The tetrameric structure observed for WtFlK&#x000b7;FAcCPan is formed by a dimer of dimers with pseudo 222 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). The main interaction regions are the 10-strand &#x003b2;-sheets present in the dimers, which are positioned back to back. Non-polar interactions predominate, but additionally there are some water-mediated hydrogen bonds. Similar tetramers have been observed in other thioesterases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The contact area between two dimers is &#x0223c;3300 &#x0212b;<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to about 30% of the total solvent-accessible area of each dimer, further suggesting the possibility of an equilibrium between dimers and tetramer in solution.</p></sec><sec><title>The Active Site</title><p>Consistent with the results of the site-directed mutagenesis of FlK described above, the crystal structure of apo-form WtFlK shows that side chains of the candidate catalytic residues Thr<sup>42</sup> and His<sup>76</sup> in one protomer and that of Glu<sup>50</sup> from the adjacent protomer cluster between the dimer interface into the region between the &#x0201c;bun&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;sausage&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). As expected, the O<sub>&#x003b3;1</sub> of Thr<sup>42</sup> and the N<sub>&#x003b4;1</sub> of His<sup>76</sup> are within hydrogen bonding distance (2.74 &#x0212b;). To our surprise, we observed that the carboxylic group of Glu<sup>50</sup> is located on the opposite side of Thr<sup>42</sup>, where it cannot have any direct contact with His<sup>76</sup>. However, a water molecule (Wat<sup>1</sup>) is in a perfect position to form a hydrogen bond with the N<sub>&#x003b4;2</sub> of His<sup>76</sup> (2.79 &#x0212b;). This water molecule is conserved in the crystal structures of wild-type and mutant FlK with or without bound ligands. Although this observation was unexpected, it is in good agreement with our site-directed mutagenesis results. A water molecule replacing the acidic residue in this type of catalytic triad was also found in the HAV-3C gene product, an &#x003b1;-chymotrypsin-like protease produced by the hepatitis A picornavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The Thr<sup>42</sup>-His<sup>76</sup>-Wat<sup>1</sup> network is further stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Wat<sup>1</sup> and Thr<sup>80</sup> side chain hydroxyl and another conserved water molecule (Wat<sup>2</sup>) that also forms a hydrogen bond with the Phe<sup>40</sup>-N. Around the His<sup>76</sup>-Wat<sup>1</sup>-Thr<sup>80</sup>/Wat<sup>2</sup> network, the side chains from Val<sup>39</sup>, Phe<sup>40</sup>, Ala<sup>78</sup>, Ala<sup>79</sup>, and Ile<sup>113</sup> form a hydrophobic shield, protecting the network from attack by solvent molecules. Based on our structural evidence, we now propose that the catalytic triad in FlK comprises Thr<sup>42</sup>-His<sup>76</sup>-water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>), located at the interface between two protomers with two active sites in each FlK dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Catalytic center of FlK.</bold> <italic>A</italic>, the catalytic triad of FlK is composed of Thr<sup>42</sup>, His<sup>76</sup> (shown as <italic>sticks</italic>), and a conserved water molecule (Wat) (shown as a <italic>sphere</italic>). <italic>Green</italic> and <italic>orange colors</italic> indicate the two protomers of the dimer, respectively. <italic>B</italic>, the catalytic triad is located at the dimer interface.

However, only the acetyl and &#x003b2;-mercaptoethylamine moieties from acetyl-CoA are buried in the protein, whereas the pantothenic acid and the 3&#x02032;-phosphoryl-ADP are exposed to solvent, allowing considerable flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). Three of the four protomers present in the asymmetric unit have a bound AcCoA, and in one of them, it was possible to fit the complete molecule, despite the poor electron density for the 3&#x02032;-phosphoryl-ADP moiety, possibly due to the high flexibility in the solvent. The overall structure of FlK does not change significantly as a result of the T42S point mutation and the binding of AcCoA, but the AcCoA has forced Wat<sup>4</sup> and Wat<sup>5</sup> out of the active site cavity. The acetyl methyl group of the AcCoA occupies the position of Wat<sup>5</sup>, and the thioester carbonyl oxygen interacts via a hydrogen bond to Ser<sup>42</sup>-N. The orientations of the three bound AcCoA molecules at the active site are significantly different, reflecting a dynamic AcCoA-FlK interaction process and the flexibility of the substrate binding site. The acetyl carbonyl carbons of the three bound AcCoA molecules are all in the wrong orientation with respect to O<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> of Ser<sup>42</sup> to allow nucleophilic attack.

Furthermore, the binding coordinates of the same molecule also vary in different FlK dimers, suggesting that the presence of the nucleotide part of the CoA moiety is required for the correct overall engagement of the substrate at the substrate-binding site.</p><p>In all of the FAc or Ac-bound FlK complexes, more than one molecule of FAc or Ac is bound in the large cavity of each active site. This may be a consequence of the high ligand concentrations (0.2 <sc>m</sc>) used in the crystallization solution and of the absence of the substrate. Interestingly but not surprisingly, at each active site, there is always one ligand situated at a position to where either the acetyl group of the AcCoA or the equivalent moiety of FAcCPan or FAcOPan is bound. The negatively charged carboxylic oxygen moieties of the ligands and the fluorine in the case of FAc are usually in contact with Thr<sup>42</sup>-N and/or Gly<sup>69</sup>-N in a seemingly random manner in terms of hydrogen bond donor-acceptor matching, suggesting that the backbone amide groups of Thr<sup>42</sup> and Gly<sup>69</sup> may be crucial binding interactions available at the active site to bind the substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Computational Docking of FAcCoA to FlK</title><p>We have modeled a FAcCoA molecule into WtFlK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), based on the crystal structures of FlK in complex with various ligands, especially with AcCoA. The minimum energy was calculated using the SYBYL 8.1.1.09097 program. In a similar way to the AcCoA bound in T42SFlK, the 3&#x02032;-phosphoryl-ADP region of the docked FAcCoA is at the enzyme surface in front of the entrance of the tunnel leading to the active site. The rest of the molecule extends into the tunnel, where the pantetheinyl moiety interacts through its N<sub>12</sub>, O<sub>9,</sub> N<sub>14</sub>, and C<sub>19</sub>, respectively, with the main chain oxygen and the side chain of His<sup>76</sup>, Ala<sup>79</sup>-N, and Phe<sup>128</sup>-C<sub>&#x003f5;1</sub>. The hydrogen bond between the side chains of Arg<sup>120</sup> and Glu<sup>50</sup> is broken due to the flip of the carboxyl group of the Glu<sup>50</sup>. The fluorine is placed at a hydrogen bonding distance from Gly<sup>69</sup>-N and the guanidinium group of Arg<sup>120</sup>. Mutation of the Arg<sup>120</sup> to Ala<sup>120</sup> yielded a completely insoluble protein (data not shown), consistent with the involvement of Arg<sup>120</sup> in maintaining the conformation of FlK. Thr<sup>42</sup>-O&#x003b3; is now located closer (3.79 &#x0212b;) to the thioester carbonyl carbon and at a better, although not optimal, position for a possible nucleophilic attack. The Thr<sup>42</sup>-N that is close (2.81 &#x0212b;) to the thioester carbonyl oxygen could act as an oxyanion hole for stabilization of the tetrahedral acyl-enzyme intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed FAcCoA coordination at the active site of FlK.</bold> <italic>A</italic>, a stick model with FAcCoA shown in <italic>silver</italic> and residues from the two protomers represented in <italic>yellow</italic> and <italic>green colors</italic>, respectively. <italic>B</italic>, a scheme with FAcCoA (<italic>red</italic>) and active site residues (<italic>black</italic>).

The selectivity of FlK to distinguish FAcCoA from AcCoA is remarkable because it ensures that AcCoA, a key intermediate of the primary metabolism is not cleaved by mistake. The only difference between the two compounds is the presence of a fluorine atom in FAcCoA but not in AcCoA. A combination of x-ray crystallography with site-directed mutagenesis experiments allowed us to gain insights into both catalytic mechanism and the unique substrate specificity of FlK.</p><p>Our investigations suggest that FlK utilizes a catalytic triad composed of a threonine (Thr<sup>42</sup>), a histidine (His<sup>76</sup>), and a water molecule. The imidazole side chain of His<sup>76</sup> acts as a base to deprotonate the hydroxyl of Thr<sup>42</sup>. The nucleophile Thr<sup>42</sup>-O<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> attacks the fluoroacetyl carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral transition intermediate. The positive charge generated on the His<sup>76</sup> residue is stabilized by the hydrogen bonding between the imidazole ring and the conserved water molecule. Reformation of the carbonyl double bond breaks the carbon-sulfur bond. A second tetrahedral intermediate is then formed between the -OH part of a water molecule and the carbonyl group of the fluoroacetyl-FlK intermediate. The remaining proton of the water is bonded to His<sup>76</sup>. When the carbonyl bond reforms, the bond to the Thr<sup>42</sup>-O<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> is broken, releasing the fluoroacetate. The His<sup>76</sup>-bonded hydrogen is transferred to Thr<sup>42</sup>-O<sub>&#x003b3;</sub>, reestablishing the hydrogen bonding between Thr<sup>42</sup> and His<sup>76</sup>. The Glu<sup>50</sup>, which is conserved in most type II thioesterases as the catalytic residue, is not a part of the catalytic mechanism of FlK but plays an important role in maintaining the configuration of the active site.</p><p>It is not unexpected that T42SFlK is active because the Ser<sup>42</sup>-O&#x003b3; can still form a hydrogen bond with the imidazole side chain of His<sup>76</sup> and therefore has the potential to act as a nucleophile as the Thr<sup>42</sup>-O<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> in WtFlK. When FAcCoA concentration was higher than 12 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, however, excess-substrate inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) was observed for the mutant. In other words, high concentrations of FAcCoA inhibited the activity of T42SFlK. We speculate that the absence of the Thr<sup>42</sup>-C<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> in T42SFlK may have created more space, allowing an easier access of substrate to the active site, especially at low substrate concentrations, giving rise to the lower <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value and the higher turnover of T42SFlK reaction as compared with WtFlK activity. However, the same mutation also increased protein flexibility, as shown by the double confirmations of the active site residues in some of the protomers of the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The enzyme-substrate complex formed between these abnormal active sites and substrate could be non-productive. At high substrate concentrations, the chance of non-productive enzyme-substrate complex formation increases when more and more normal active sites are occupied by FAcCoA. The formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate complex at the active site of one protomer may also interfere with the catalytic activity of the partner protomer of the same dimer. These may explain the excess-substrate inhibition phenomenon observed for T42SFlK and E50AFlK, but the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.</p><p>FlK is a homodimer with a hot dog fold similar to other type II thioesterases, although it does not show extensive sequence similarity to any type II thioesterases with known function. A common feature shared by nearly all functionally characterized hot dog fold thioesterases is the presence of an acidic residue, aspartate or glutamate, providing general base catalysis. One exception is FcoT, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, which has a hot dog fold but uses an active site completely different from that of either type I or type II thioesterases. FcoT has been proposed to represent a new class of thioesterases, type III thioesterases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). With a type II thioesterase fold, the catalytic machinery of FlK (Thr-His-water) resembles those of type I thioesterases (Ser/Cys-base-acid), exhibiting an unconventional combination of protein fold and catalytic mechanism. Superposition of FlK with 18 structures of type II thioesterases from the Protein Data Bank reveals that the Glu<sup>50</sup> in FlK is well conserved in most of these thioesterases, although in some cases, it is an aspartate instead of a glutamate (data not shown).</p><p>Among all of the hot dog fold proteins in the Protein Data Bank, only two hypothetical proteins, TTHA0967 (Protein Data Bank entry <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2CWZ">2CWZ</ext-link>) from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> and TM0581 (Protein Data Bank entry <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2Q78">2Q78</ext-link>) from <italic>Thermotoga maritime</italic>, have shown head-to-tail sequence similarity to FlK (33 and 22% identity, respectively). Superposition of FlK with these two structures has revealed a very similar putative active site in 2CWZ and 2Q78. Most of the residues lining the active site of FlK, Thr<sup>42</sup>, Glu<sup>50</sup>, Gly<sup>69</sup>, and His<sup>76</sup>, are well conserved in 2CWZ (Thr<sup>36</sup>, Glu<sup>44</sup>, Gly<sup>63</sup>, and His<sup>76</sup>) and in 2Q78 (Thr<sup>38</sup>, His<sup>72</sup>, and Arg<sup>116</sup>) with the following differences. First, the counterpart of the Arg<sup>120</sup> of FlK in 2CWZ is a glutamine (Gln<sup>115</sup>). The Arg<sup>120</sup> in the unliganded FlK interacts through its guanidinium group with the carboxyl side chain of Glu<sup>50</sup>. The amide side chain of Gln<sup>115</sup> in CWZ2, however, is pointing in the opposite direction with no possibility of forming any direct contact with Glu<sup>44</sup>. A large empty space can be observed in the putative active site of 2CWZ due to this change of Arg to Gln. If 2CWZ is also an acyl-CoA thioesterase, the substrate should have a larger acyl moiety than a fluoroacetyl group. Second, the equivalents of FlK Glu<sup>50</sup> and Gly<sup>69</sup> in 2Q78 are His<sup>46</sup> and Val<sup>65</sup>, respectively. The imidazole side chain of the His<sup>46</sup> and the isopropyl group of the Val<sup>65</sup> at the active site provide a binding motif quite different from that in FlK.</p><p>The significant differences in the overall positions of FAcCPan and FAcOPan in the active site of FlK as compared with that of the acetyl-pantheteinyl segment of the T42SFlK-bound AcCoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) suggest that binding of the nucleotide portion of the substrate on the enzyme surface dictates the depth to which the fluoroacetyl pantetheinyl arm extends into the active site cleft, ensuring the correct interaction between the arm with the amino acid residues in the vicinity of the active site. Although the sulfur atom of the thioester is considered a poor hydrogen bond acceptor, the transient dipole interaction between the sulfur and the main chain amides along the substrate binding tunnel may also contribute to positioning of the substrate. In the absence of the bulky nucleotide tail and the sulfur atom, FAcCPan moved further into the active site. FAcOPan is retained near the tunnel entrance because the oxygen atom replacing the sulfur atom has a stronger tendency to interact with the main chain amides of the substrate binding tunnel.</p><p>Although the 3&#x02032;-phosphoryl ADP tail of FAcCoA is required for the overall positioning of FAcCoA in the FlK active site, the accurate orientation of the fluoroacetyl thioester moiety must be fine tuned by the hydrogen bonding of the fluorine with the side chain of Arg<sup>120</sup> and the main chain amide of Gly<sup>69</sup> in order to assume the required catalytic coordination. The guanidinium group of Arg<sup>120</sup> and the main chain amide of Gly<sup>69</sup> appear to be the key determinants for the unusual high substrate specificity of FlK, which serve to recognize the only structural difference between FAcCoA and AcCoA through their interactions with the fluorine of FAcCoA. Moreover, the thioester carbonyl carbon in FAcCoA is more positively charged than that in AcCoA due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine. The interactions between the fluorine and Arg<sup>120</sup>/Gly<sup>69</sup> also help to stabilize this positive charge, making the carbonyl carbon a better target for nucleophilic attack by Thr<sup>42</sup>-O<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>The atomic coordinates and structure factors (codes <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3KX7">3KX7</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3KX8">3KX8</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3KV7">3KV7</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3KV8">3KV8</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3KVZ">3KVZ</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3KW1">3KW1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3KUV">3KUV</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3KUW">3KUW</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3KVU">3KVU</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3KVI">3KVI</ext-link>) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/">http://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>).</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN8"><label>8</label><p>The abbreviations used are:
