In the most comprehensive study to date, Murray et al. reported an estimated 4.95 million deaths associated with bacterial AMR globally in 2019 alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Chief among the list of AMR culprits are pathogenic strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, including third-generation cephalosporin-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, which in total account for more than 800,000 associated deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. AMR is challenging to address because resistance is an inherent consequence of antimicrobial drug use; even a single long-term infection may result in the emergence of drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The ubiquitous and non-compliant overuse of antimicrobials in both clinical and agricultural settings contribute to large scale resistance evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Despite recent attention to AMR, the incidence of multidrug resistant (MDR) infections continues to rise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and resistance to newer drugs is often observed within a few years of deployment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast, the rate of antimicrobial drug discovery has declined considerably owing to low profitability and shifting priorities within the pharmaceutical industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, further exacerbating the AMR crisis.</p><p id="Par4">One approach to treating AMR strains is to exploit orthogonal sensitivities to one drug that arise from resistance to another drug, a phenomenon known as collateral sensitivity (CS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. CS interactions have been widely observed in both drug-resistant microbes and in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and are thought to result from trade-offs inherent to the maintenance of pleiotropic drug resistance mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Using laboratory-evolved drug-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, several studies have mapped out CS relationships between known antibiotics and have demonstrated their application against clinical isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These include the deployment of two reciprocally CS-active drugs in an alternating drug-cycling regimen, such as cefuroxime and gentamicin in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, or the use of a primary drug with its CS-active adjuvant in combination. For example, using mecillinam with cefotaxime has been shown to constrain the evolution of a globally distributed extended spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Most bacterial CS studies to date, however, have been limited to known, commercially available antimicrobials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Few studies have examined the CS potential of natural products (NPs) from an antimicrobial perspective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, despite the obvious value of NP chemical diversity and biological relevance in antibiotic therapy development.</p><p id="Par5">In the context of drug resistance, both known and novel NPs have the potential for CS activity. This provides an opportunity to re-examine the chemical space occupied by known NPs, which may contribute to the discovery and design of new CS-based antimicrobials. Furthermore, CS-active compounds can improve understanding of complex CS mechanisms, as well as provide additional insight into the associated mechanisms of resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">This work presents a high-throughput screening platform, based on a panel of 29 isogenic drug-resistant mutants of <italic>E. coli</italic>, to map and identify natural products that elicit CS across diverse drug-resistant phenotypes, termed Collateral Sensitivity Profiling (CSP). We first validate this approach using a collection of commercial antimicrobials covering 30 drug classes, revealing both new and previously reported CS relationships. Extrapolating this hypothesis into novel chemical space, we report the screening of a library of 6195 marine Actinobacterial and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> natural product extract prefractions and the observation of widespread CS interactions in nature. From this screen, we describe the isolation and characterization of the borrelidin family of macrolide NPs, including a new analogue borrelidin P, with specific CS activity against cephalosporin-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> but not wildtype (WT). To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a new NP compound discovered on the basis of its CS activity. Follow-up experiments reveal that threonine&#x02014;tRNA ligase (ThrRS), the known target of the borrelidins, contributes to the observed CS interaction with <italic>E. coli</italic> strains bearing cell wall biosynthesis mutations. Further investigation suggests that other targets of the borrelidins may also play a role in its CS activity. Finally, we show that co-dosing ceftazidime with borrelidin A slows the emergence of cephalosporin resistance and suppresses existing ceftazidime resistance below key thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Development of a high-throughput collateral sensitivity screen in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic></title><p id="Par7">To identify CS interactions, a panel of 29 drug-resistant strains covering multiple drug classes was derived from the standard lab model <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 (K-12). Twenty-six of these strains carry chromosomal resistance mutations and were isolated as spontaneous mutants on various antibiotic-containing agar plates, while an additional three strains were transformed using multidrug-resistant (MDR) plasmids from previously characterized clinical isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Each mutant was sequenced to determine the genetic basis of its resistance, relevance to the clinical literature, and to ensure that it harbored only a single mutant gene, where applicable (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This approach allows unbiased comparisons between WT and drug-resistant strains due to a uniform genetic background and thus provides a fundamental perspective of CS in any chemical library. In brief, the target panel is comprised of the following: 7 quinolone-resistant strains with mutations in either DNA gyrase subunit A (<italic>gyrA</italic>) or subunit B (<italic>gyrB</italic>); 4 chromosomal multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains with mutations in one of two multidrug efflux pump pathways (<italic>marR</italic> or <italic>acrR</italic>); 3 rifamycin-resistant strains with mutations in bacterial RNA polymerase subunit &#x003b2; (<italic>rpoB</italic>); 4 cephalosporin-resistant strains with mutations in either cell envelope biosynthesis (<italic>envZ</italic>) or lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (<italic>rfaH, rfaG</italic>); and 8 aminoglycoside-resistant strains with mutations in the cytochrome o oxidation pathway (<italic>cyoA</italic>), ubiquinone biosynthesis genes (<italic>ubiB, ubiF</italic>), or the 30S ribosomal protein S12 (<italic>rpsL</italic>). The 3 plasmid-borne MDR strains contain vectors from drug-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> (pAC29, pAC30) or <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> (RK2). Together, the target panel covers a broad range of resistance mechanisms, including DNA replication, RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, cell wall biosynthesis, MDR, and plasmid-borne resistance. Approximately 60% of these strains contain mutations that have been previously reported in drug-resistant pathogens, with varying levels of clinical relevance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">We emphasized single, chromosomal mutants in this target panel as opposed to more clinically relevant mobile resistance cassettes for three main reasons. Firstly, the focus of this study was to explore the prevalence of CS in nature using a first-principles approach; target panel selection prioritizing diversity in drug resistance mechanisms was better aligned with this goal compared to exclusive representation by clinically relevant plasmid-borne &#x003b2;-lactamases. CSP therefore aims to identify a broad range of CS responses to provide broad biological target coverage for large libraries containing diverse chemistries. Secondly, CS screening of complex NP extracts necessitated a simple, minimally-variable genetic background due to the potential for interference. Multi-gene mutants and plasmid-borne resistance vectors contain several points of variability, which together may produce synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions that complicate comparison with the WT strain. Instead, we selected only single gene mutants that would unambiguously connect any observed CS interaction to a specific drug resistance mutation and compound/extract. Thirdly, chromosomal resistance mutations are more genetically stable and therefore more amenable to high-throughput screening. In contrast, plasmid-borne strains may require both retention control (selection antibiotic) and copy control (inducer) to standardize expression, significantly complicating CS screening.</p><p id="Par9">For CSP, we developed a fully automated 384-well microtiter assay protocol that systematically tests each chemical sample against all 30 test strains (WT&#x02009;+&#x02009;29 drug-resistant strains; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each strain was dispensed into clear microtiter plates at a standardized inoculum before treatment with test compounds (either as dilution series for antimicrobial agents or at a single stock concentration for natural product extracts). Compound-treated plates were incubated overnight, and cell growth assessed via OD<sub>600</sub> absorbance. The activity of a given test compound/extract against each of the 29 drug-resistant strains was then used to construct an activity &#x02018;fingerprint&#x02019; by standardizing to the activity of the WT strain. Loss of activity in one or more mutant strains compared to the WT signified resistance or cross resistance (CR). Conversely, an increase in activity in one or more mutant strains compared to WT inferred a CS interaction. CSP thus provides a clear and comprehensive examination of the CS properties of any compound library in high throughput.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of collateral sensitivity profiling (CSP).</title><p>Eighty antimicrobials covering a broad range of drug classes (control set for assay optimization) and an in-house library of 6195 natural product extract prefractions served as the primary source of chemical diversity for this study. Both the antimicrobial control set and the natural product library were systematically screened against wildtype <italic>E. coli</italic> (WT) and 29 drug-resistant strains (S1&#x02013;S29) as either dilution series (antimicrobials) or at a single stock concentration (natural product prefractions); growth monitored via OD<sub>600</sub> readings.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for each drug-strain combination were used to calculate fold-change differences (Log<sub>2</sub>MIC<sub>Mutant</sub>&#x02009;&#x02013;&#x02009;Log<sub>2</sub>MIC<sub>WT</sub>) between WT and drug-resistant strains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; for a fully annotated table with quantified values, see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In total, 34 out of 80 antimicrobial compounds induced at least a 2-fold increase in resistance to one or more drug-resistant strains, with the largest difference corresponding to an upwards 256-fold shift in the MIC. As anticipated, resistance and CR among mutant strains were observed for their original selection antibiotic and same-class analogues, respectively. Both chromosomal and plasmid-borne MDR strains exhibited widespread CR patterns across the entire antimicrobial set, notably against &#x003b2;-lactams, fluoroquinolones, rifamycins, and tetracyclines. Conversely, 43 antimicrobial compounds presented a minimum of 2-fold increase in CS activity to one or more strains; the largest being a downwards 32-fold shift in the MIC. CS activity was generally congruent among same-class analogues. The cephalosporin-resistant cell wall biosynthesis mutants, Cef6 and Cef7, displayed increased sensitivity towards a broad range of antimicrobials, including select fluoroquinolones, rifamycins, select aminoglycosides, macrolides, amphenicols, anthracyclines, and lipopeptides. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have identified a correlation between the frequency of CS interactions and cell wall mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, amphenicol antimicrobials presented broad and consistent CS activity in strains with rifamycin and aminoglycoside resistance, as well as plasmid-borne MDR. The CS relationship between chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> has been previously reported by Imamovic, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Here, we show that chloramphenicol&#x02019;s CS activity can be extrapolated to other amphenicols, which together are also CS-active against select cephalosporin-, fluoroquinolone-, and MDR strains in addition to aminoglycoside-resistant strains. A recent study by Li et al. demonstrated the utility of pleuromutilin antibiotics in treating vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Analogously, CS profiling has shown that the pleuromutilin antibiotic tiamulin presents potent CS activity across the spectrum of drug-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. Finally, certain antimicrobials, such as polymyxin B and novobiocin, possessed unique CS activity profiles not shared by their analogues.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Collateral sensitivity profiling (CSP) of 80 commercial antimicrobials against a drug-resistant <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> target panel.</title><p>Legend: white&#x02009;=&#x02009;no change in Log<sub>2</sub>MIC compared to wildtype; red&#x02009;=&#x02009;increase in Log<sub>2</sub>MIC compared to wildtype (resistance); blue&#x02009;=&#x02009;decrease in Log<sub>2</sub>MIC compared to wildtype (collateral sensitivity).

Out of 6195 total, 631 extracts (617 Actinobacteria and 14 <italic>Burkholderia</italic>) displayed CR relationships in at least one drug-resistant strain. A significant portion of the NP library elicited strong resistance from the aminoglycoside-resistant Str4 mutant, while a distinct cluster of extracts experienced CR from several MDR strains (Tet8, Cm2, Cm3), the rifamycin-resistant strains (Rif1, Rif7, Rif11), and one fluoroquinolone-resistant strain (Cip15KB; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). By contrast, the multidrug-resistant <italic>marR</italic> mutant Cip8 was not susceptible to most extracts, exhibiting few CR or CS interactions. The cephalosporin-resistant cell wall strains (Cef1, Cef6, Cef7, Cef8) produced strong but variable patterns of both CR and CS across the entire natural product library. Uniformity of response between the four related mutant strains was low but the overall potency, either CR or CS, was high in relation to other strains. Some strains were similarly prone to strong CR and/or CS responses, such as the rifamycin-resistant strain Rif1.

For example, one major cluster of extracts presented a CS profile that mirrored the CR profile shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, with increased activity against select MDR, rifamycin-, and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains (corresponding to category four; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>).

Many extracts that elicited CR in a set of drug-resistant strains also induced CS in other strains, and vice versa.

These extracts were prepared as half-step dilution series (16 two-fold dilutions) from their stock concentrations and rescreened against the full target panel (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This secondary assay served to both verify the original CS activity from the primary screen and quantify the magnitude of the CS shift between WT and mutant MICs. Although the absolute concentrations of compounds in each prefraction are unknown, the relative difference in these MIC shifts between WT and drug-resistant strains provided a measure of the strength of the observed CS effect. In all cases, positive fold change values between the MICs indicated CR to the active compounds by the drug-resistant mutant, while negative fold change values indicated the presence of CS interactions. Of the 117 extracts selected for secondary screening, 72 extracts exhibited measurable CS activity with at least a two-fold difference in MIC for at least one drug-resistant strain. 39 out of 72 extracts displayed CS activity only, while 33 extracts presented a combination of CS and CR activities, depending on the drug-resistant strain.

Both Cef6 and Cef7 strains were selected on ceftazidime and have been determined to carry mutations that affect the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway. These mutations confer resistance against cephalosporins but also increased sensitivity to borrelidins in a CS context. We reasoned that the presence of ceftazidime in the WT strain may improve borrelidin activity (possibly through permeabilization) and vice versa (borrelidins destabilizing cell wall biosynthesis), thereby producing a synergistic interaction. To that end, ceftazidime and <bold>1</bold> (the most potent borrelidin analogue) were screened together using two-dimensional checkerboard assays against WT, Cef7, and the MDR RK2 strains. The &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotic ampicillin was used as a control for ceftazidime. Resulting absorbance data were normalized as percent growth values, with the combination of the lowest compound concentrations resulting in at least 50% inhibition of growth used to calculate the fractional inhibitory index (FIC). In WT <italic>E. coli</italic>, ceftazidime in conjunction with <bold>1</bold> produced strong additive interactions (FIC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.56) but not synergy (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A</xref>). The same was true for <bold>1</bold> with ampicillin (FIC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63).

However, the FIC remained unchanged (0.5), as was the case for <bold>1</bold> with ampicillin (FIC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5).

In this work, we present a high-throughput screening platform, termed CSP, for the systematic identification of CS-active compounds in large chemical libraries. CSP leverages a diverse single mutant target panel to facilitate annotation of the gene/pathway responsible for resistance, and by extension highlight one-compound-to-one-gene CS interactions. Initial screening of 80 commercial antimicrobials covering 30 drug classes using CSP revealed both known and novel CS relationships (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Imamovic and Sommer have previously identified CS interactions between aminoglycoside-resistant strains and multiple antimicrobials, including cefuroxime, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We have observed similar CS interactions in our aminoglycoside-resistant strains against these same compounds and/or same-class analogues, suggesting an underlying CS relationship despite variations in the specific mutations that confer aminoglycoside resistance. Interestingly, the aminoglycoside resistance-chloramphenicol CS interaction shown in this study extended to the fluorinated methyl-sulfonyl chloramphenicol analogue florfenicol, but not the defluorinated methyl-sulfonyl analogue thiamphenicol, further suggesting that this class of compounds possesses a unique structure-activity relationship with its CS target. In addition, all three amphenicols exhibited reproducible CS activity in both plasmid-borne MDR strains carrying clinical resistance cassettes from the IncF incompatibility group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Whether these CS relationships derive from a common CS target or are caused by different CS relationships for each resistant strain remains an open question, but the consistent CS profiles between members of the same antibiotic class demonstrates the varied and pervasive nature of CS relationships in drug-resistant populations.</p><p id="Par24">Subsequent CSP screening of our 6195-member natural product extract library also revealed widespread CS interactions in nature (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). To our knowledge, this screen represents the largest and most comprehensive examination of antimicrobial CS in natural products to date. In contrast to previous CS studies which have focused on known antimicrobials, or in one instance antimicrobial peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, NPs offer unparalleled chemical diversity and biological relevance from a therapeutic perspective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The broader conclusion from this study is that CS interactions are prevalent in NP libraries, and are compound class specific, suggesting that a large number of CS agents remain to be discovered. The discovery of NP-based CS agents differs from conventional NP adjuvant or synergy screens where a primary antibiotic is co-dosed along with the test extract to discover NPs that restore the activity of the primary compound. Instead, CSP exclusively identifies extracts with preferential activity against drug-resistant mutants over WT, where the CS agent is itself active against the resistant strain.</p><p id="Par25">Using a set of triage protocols and secondary screening procedures, hit extracts from the library were examined in detail. These efforts led to the isolation of the borrelidin family of NPs, with borrelidin A (<bold>1</bold>) producing MICs 128- and 64-fold lower in the Cef6 (<italic>rfaH</italic> W4*) and Cef7 (<italic>rfaG</italic> E289fs) strains compared to WT, respectively.

Second, both laboratory and clinical isolates of &#x003b2;-lactam-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> have been found to contain mutations in <italic>thrS</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, the known target of the borrelidins. Studies have shown that inactivation of ThrRS results in a stringent response that reduces bacterial growth rate, which contributes to the observed resistance phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In this study, we show that <bold>1</bold> is a concentration-dependent inhibitor of ThrRS that preferentially kills cephalosporin-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> (with deleterious mutations in <italic>rfa</italic> genes) as well as a MDR strain carrying the RK2 plasmid from clinical isolates of <italic>K. aerogenes</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We furthermore demonstrate that this CS activity cannot be replicated by combination therapy between <bold>1</bold> and ceftazidime in the WT, and is therefore solely the result of the resistance mutations (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Several studies have found that <italic>rfa</italic> mutants exhibit increased sensitivities to large, nonpolar antibiotics due to truncated LPS and thus a weaker protective barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>; a finding corroborated in our own antimicrobial screen (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). While this offers a possible explanation for the borrelidins&#x02019; CS activity, quantitative mass spectrometry has shown that the intracellular concentrations of <bold>1</bold> do not increase between WT and the cephalosporin-resistant <italic>rfa</italic> mutants (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This finding refutes increased influx, decreased efflux, and inactivation/digestion of <bold>1</bold> as the cause for CS. The combination of existing evidence would suggest that the loss of biological fitness owing to both <italic>rfa</italic>-related LPS truncation and ThrRS inhibition is responsible for the observed CS interaction.</p><p id="Par26">The cytotoxicity exhibited by the known borrelidins precludes their use in a clinical context,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> although the toxicity profile for the new desnitrile analogue <bold>4</bold> has yet to be determined.

CSP of our NP library has revealed plentiful examples of such relationships, with unique distributions of CS activity in a host of diverse drug-resistant strains. Because the CS-active compounds prioritized from this screen are selectively active against drug-resistant populations, they are typically only weakly active against WT strains, making them unsuitable as frontline monotherapies. Instead, the value of CS agents stems from their ability to selectively target drug-resistant populations via mechanisms that are distinct from partner antimicrobials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Co-dosing <bold>1</bold> at either 32 or 128&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (sub-MIC concentrations in WT) with ceftazidime suppressed ceftazidime resistance below the EUCAST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> breakpoint for <italic>E. coli</italic> (4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) over a period of 12 days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). By contrast, in the CS-null condition (ceftazidime co-dosed with norfloxacin), resistance to ceftazidime evolved at the nearly the same rate as ceftazidime alone, despite the presence of two antibiotics with different mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the resulting drug-resistant strains showed extensive CR to other cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones (and thus MDR; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Co-dosing with <bold>1</bold> presented no self-resistance and instead led to the emergence of CS to fluoroquinolones, supporting the fundamental finding that CS manifests in fitness trade-offs concomitant with the evolution of drug resistance. Together these results pave the way for the discovery of a new suite of natural product-based CS agents with direct application in the prevention and treatment of AMR infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Generation of drug-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains</title><p id="Par28">Isolation of ciprofloxacin-resistant and nalidixic acid-resistant strains was performed as described above.

All treatments are performed in triplicate in 96- well plates with 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of LB media. Four concentrations were tested for each treatment, increasing two-fold from the starting concentration (i.e., treatment A: 0.063&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, 0.125&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, 0.25&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, and 0.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M). Post-treatment and inoculation, plates were incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24&#x02009;h before an absorbance reading at OD<sub>600</sub> is taken. The highest drug concentration resulting in at least 50% growth inhibition for each replicate was used to inoculate the subsequent day&#x02019;s treatment wells at a 1:100 ratio. Ceftazidime and norfloxacin drug concentration gradients were also modified in 2-fold steps as required to ensure that at least one concentration that produced 100% growth. Borrelidin A treatments were maintained at fixed concentrations. Resistance monitoring/sequential passaging was repeated daily for 12 consecutive days, the maximum length of time achievable given the high rate of consumption of a limited NP compound. The difference between day 1 and day 12 MIC values for each passaging condition was analyzed by a one-way ANOVA with Tukey&#x02019;s HSD test. At the conclusion of the experiment, the most resistant samples from each replicate were archived as glycerol stocks at &#x02212;70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. To determine the MIC for each resistant strain under standard conditions, glycerol stocks were thawed and used to inoculate overnight cultures. Ceftazidime, cefadroxil, cefaclor, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and borrelidin A were prepared as 1:1 dilution series (128&#x02009;&#x003bc;M to ~3.9&#x02009;nM) in DMSO and reformatted into a 384-well plate. All compounds were screened against the ceftazidime-resistant strains following standard procedures described above and their MICs determined for each resistant replicate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par49">Further information on research design is available in the&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec29"><p>
