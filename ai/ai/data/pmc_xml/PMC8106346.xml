The genomes of anaerobic gut fungi are poorly characterized and have not been extensively mined for the biosynthetic enzymes of natural products such as antibiotics. Here, we investigate the potential of anaerobic gut fungi to synthesize natural products that could regulate membership within the gut microbiome. Complementary 'omics' approaches were combined to catalog the natural products of anaerobic gut fungi from four different representative species: <italic>Anaeromyces robustus </italic>(<italic>A</italic>. <italic>robustus</italic>), <italic>Caecomyces churrovis </italic>(<italic>C</italic>. <italic>churrovis</italic>), <italic>Neocallimastix californiae </italic>(<italic>N</italic>. <italic>californiae</italic>), and <italic>Piromyces finnis</italic> (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>finnis</italic>). In total, 146 genes were identified that encode biosynthetic enzymes for diverse types of natural products, including nonribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases. In addition, <italic>N. californiae</italic> and <italic>C. churrovis</italic> genomes encoded seven putative bacteriocins, a class of antimicrobial peptides typically produced by bacteria. During standard laboratory growth on plant biomass or soluble substrates, 26% of total core biosynthetic genes in all four strains were transcribed. Across all four fungal strains, 30% of total biosynthetic gene products were detected via proteomics when grown on cellobiose. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) characterization of fungal supernatants detected 72 likely natural products from <italic>A. robustus</italic> alone. A compound produced by all four strains of anaerobic fungi was putatively identified as the polyketide-related styrylpyrone baumin. Molecular networking quantified similarities between tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra among these fungi, enabling three groups of natural products to be identified that are unique to anaerobic fungi. Overall, these results support the finding that anaerobic gut fungi synthesize natural products, which could be harnessed as a source of antimicrobials, therapeutics, and other bioactive compounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>natural products</kwd><kwd>secondary metabolism</kwd><kwd>anaerobes</kwd><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital</funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">n/a</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Michelle A O'Malley</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (Gordon E. and Betty I.

In addition to pharmaceuticals, natural products have also found use as valuable bio-based products such as drop-in biofuels and renewable polymers (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Across microbial diversity, fungi are especially prolific secondary metabolite producers, with a single strain such as <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> FGSC A4 producing 15 compounds characterized in the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster database (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) or <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> with over 18 characterized metabolites (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Despite the wealth of valuable polyketides and other secondary metabolites already derived from fungi, the capacity for discovery is far from realization. Certain fungal genera, such as <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, are disproportionately studied, although they represent only a fraction of sequenced fungal genomes (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Rediscovery of natural products like antibiotics has proved problematic, requiring innovative approaches to silence known antibiotic-producing genes (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), or alternatively, investigation of rarely explored microbiomes, such as the rumen, for sequence-divergent biosynthetic genes. Examples of antibiotics discovered from unusual environments include lugdunin, which was discovered from a commensal bacteria of the human microbiome (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), as well as teixobactin, which was discovered from a screen of previously uncultured bacteria (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Both lugdunin and teixobactin were active against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and teixobactin was active without detectable resistance.</p><p>Anaerobic gut fungi (class Neocallimastigomycetes) are understudied organisms that thrive as members of a consortium of archaea, bacteria, and protozoa in the digestive tracts of large herbivores (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In these habitats, fungi are vastly outnumbered by prokaryotic microorganisms by several orders of magnitude (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). For instance, rumen bacteria are estimated at 10<sup>10</sup> cells per gram rumen contents (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) whereas fungi are estimated at 10<sup>6</sup> per gram (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These fungi are of recent biotechnological interest due to their array of biomass-degrading enzymes, but through genome and transcriptome sequencing it has become evident that they also have a range of biosynthetic enzymes for natural products (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We hypothesize that anaerobic gut fungi synthesize natural products to compete with other microbes for survival in their native environment. Natural products are known to serve a variety of functions to their producers in other environments, including oxidative stress tolerance (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), fungal development (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and antibiosis (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Similarly, the natural products of anaerobic gut fungi may serve directly (by antibiosis) or indirectly (by conferring environmental stress tolerance) to allow the fungi to persist despite being outnumbered by other members of the rumen community.</p><p>Here, we take an integrated approach combining genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to develop a pipeline to identify and characterize natural products from anaerobic gut fungi. By using antibiotics and Secondary Metabolites Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), we classify the types of biosynthetic enzymes present in the fungal genomes of representative Neocallimastigomycetes and quantify the homology between strains as well as to other organisms. Transcriptomics and proteomics are used to validate and refine these predictions. Finally, we demonstrate by metabolomics and molecular networking that anaerobic gut fungi produce a polyketide-related compound baumin, as well as at least three groups of natural products.</p><sec sec-type="results|discussion" id="s1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2"><title>The Genomes of Anaerobic Gut Fungi Encode Diverse Biosynthetic Enzymes for Natural Products and Antimicrobial Peptides.</title><p>Previously, we isolated and sequenced the genomes of four species of anaerobic gut fungi from the early-branching fungal class Neocallimastigomycetes (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).

For all strains except <italic>A. robustus</italic>, antiSMASH, with the ClusterFinder algorithm enabled, predicted more biosynthetic genes because it detected a wider array of natural product classes than SMURF, including bacteriocins and putative classes such as fatty acid and saccharide derivatives.

Therefore, baumin remained the top candidate for the unknown compound. The putative baumin is a secondary metabolite directly detected from anaerobic gut fungi, and it may serve the anaerobic gut fungi as an oxygen scavenger in the rumen of the host animal after forage intake. Hobson reported up to 0.6% oxygen transiently present in the gaseous phase of the rumen (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>).</p><p>The gene cluster responsible for the production of baumin in <italic>S. baumii</italic> is not known at this time, which limited our ability to assign the gene cluster in anaerobic gut fungi. AntiSMASH predicted only one PKS gene cluster (accession OCB83923.1) with more than two domains from the <italic>S. baumii</italic> genome. The core biosynthetic gene was a hybrid NRPS-Type I PKS with PKS architecture of KS-AT-DH-KR-ACP (ketosynthase-acyltransferase-dehydratase-ketoreductase-acyl carrier protein). The domain architecture of this PKS is similar to PKS family 4 of the anaerobic fungi, although some members of this family lack the dehydratase domain (PKS genes from <italic>A. robustus</italic> scaffold 127, <italic>C. churrovis</italic> scaffold 129, and <italic>N. californiae</italic> scaffold 428).

Species of anaerobic gut fungi from four distinct genera (<italic>Anaeromyces</italic>, <italic>Caecomyces</italic>, <italic>Neocallimastix</italic>, and <italic>Piromyces</italic>) possess the biosynthetic enzymes for polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, bacteriocins, and other natural product classes. The number of detected backbone genes per fungus is on the same order of magnitude as the natural product prolific aspergilli. Upon inspection, some of the biosynthetic genes of anaerobic fungi were similar to those found in bacteria, suggesting the possibility of horizontal gene transfer between fungi and bacteria in the rumen microbiome. HGT was further supported by the fact that in phylogenetic trees of NRPS condensations domains as well as bacteriocins, the fungal genes nested within or were sister to bacterial genes. Although many of the biosynthetic genes of anaerobic fungi were similar to bacteria, their regulation may still be typical of fungal secondary metabolism. Homologs of velvet regulatory proteins, which are known to link fungal development and secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi, were identified in the predicted proteins of anaerobic fungi. PKS genes identified within the fungal genomes were highly conserved between strains, indicating that polyketides may serve important biological functions for anaerobic fungi. Even during standard laboratory growth, transcriptomics and proteomics has demonstrated that much of their secondary metabolism is active. LC-MS/MS detected numerous secondary metabolites, including a compound putatively identified as the styrylpyrone baumin. Further experiments will be necessary to decipher the functions of the secondary metabolites of anaerobic fungi, but among many possibilities, they may serve as regulators of the fungal life cycle or defense or compounds against bacterial competitors. In addition to their native function, natural products from anaerobic gut fungi are a promising source of antimicrobial peptides, antibiotics, and therapeutics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s10"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s11"><title>Routine Cultivation of Anaerobic Gut Fungi.</title><p><italic>A. robustus</italic>, <italic>C. churrovis</italic>, and <italic>N. californiae</italic> were isolated via reed canary grass enrichment from the feces of sheep or goat at the Santa Barbara Zoo, as described previously (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). <italic>P. finnis</italic> was isolated from the feces of a horse at Verrill Farm Stables in Concord, MA, USA (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).

Filtering the features that were at least fourfold higher in intensity than the control resulted in 116 peaks. Metabolite Atlas workflow tools were used to remove features that were visually recognized as artifacts of the peak-finding process (isotopes, background ions, unnecessary adducts, etc.) and to refine retention times for feature integration across files (<xref rid="r82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). These features were further filtered to those with sample/control ratios of at least 4.</p><p>Each MS2 fragmentation spectrum was searched with Pactolus, an in-house implementation of the MIDAS (Metabolite Identification via Database Searching) (<xref rid="r83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>) scoring algorithm. The MIDAS scoring algorithm traverses the possible fragmentation paths and scores an identification based on <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values matching structures along a fragmentation path. The Pactolus implementation precomputes and stores the fragmentation paths for each molecule, whereas the MIDAS algorithm computes the fragmentation paths on the fly.

To investigate the likelihood of this identification, an isotope simulation using XCalibur 2.2SP1 (Thermo Scientific) was used to determine potential molecular formulas of the feature. The chemical formula C27H22O11, which corresponds to baumin, was calculated as a protonated adduct with an error of &#x02212;0.288 ppm.

Consensus spectra with fewer than two spectra were eliminated. A network was then created with the following criteria used for the edges: 1) cosine score above 0.7 and 2) greater than six matched peaks. Furthermore, edges between nodes were only considered in the network if and only if each of the consensus spectra represented by the nodes were part of other node&#x02019;s top 10 most similar nodes. The spectra in the network were subsequently queried against the spectral libraries of GNPS. The library spectra were filtered to be consistent with the input data. Only pairings between network spectra and library spectra with scores above 0.7 and at least six matched peaks were kept.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sapp.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd01.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd02.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd03.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd04.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd05.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd06.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd07.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd08.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd09.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd10.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd11.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd12.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd13.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd14.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd15.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd16.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd17.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2019855118.sd18.txt"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research project was supported by a grant from Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), and a gift from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to M.A.O.
