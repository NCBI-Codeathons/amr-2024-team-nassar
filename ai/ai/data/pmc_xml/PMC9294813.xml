MLNs have been shown to have antibacterial activities against <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the agricultural pathogens <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as well as antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Obviously, MLNs have potential agricultural applications in controlling crop pests and disease treatment. However, the extreme scarcity of MLNs production has precluded further investigation. Due to this limitation, efforts are required to improve the production of MLNs.</p><p id="Par26">The optimization of culture conditions had been shown to be an efficient strategy in increasing the yield of fermentation products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], including MLN A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], vitamin B12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and angucycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, this strategy is typically tedious, and it does not change the genetics of strains. To enhance the polyketide production in host strains, metabolic engineering approaches have been applied successfully, e.g., overexpression of rate-limiting enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or PKS modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, there are other obstacles to polyketide production improvement. Many secondary metabolites (e.g., antibiotics and pigments) are toxic to the producer strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], resulting in enzyme inactivation or even cell death. For example, daunorubicin, a member of the type II polyketide family, exerts feedback inhibition by DNA intercalation, leading to the down regulation of PKS genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Since producer strains are subjected to feedback inhibition, the production of polyketide or antibiotic is usually maintained below the lethal concentration during the fermentation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, to improve the production of these compounds, it is important to remove the feedback inhibition. Various studies regarding the removal of feedback inhibition by end-products have been performed. The ABC system conferred in <italic>Streptomyces peucetius</italic> for self-resistance functions as an ATP-driven pump for the efflux of daunorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Although rational metabolic engineering approaches have been demonstrated to remove feedback inhibition, leading to improvements in the product yield or other characteristics of the strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], these approaches are difficult to apply to organisms with partially annotated genetic material, or lacking genetic manipulation.</p><p id="Par27">Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) is a powerful technique for improving or creating the microbial phenotypes of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Unlike rational metabolic engineering, ALE does not require researchers to gain a better understanding of the genetic information of the desired phenotype. Using ALE technology, researchers have obtained several stress-resistant mutants, including ferulic acid resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], methanol resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], anthranilate resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], isobutyl acetate resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and antibiotic overproduction mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Based on the transcriptomic and/or genomic analysis results of the evolved organism, molecular mechanisms regarding the interesting phenotype are studied. Mo et al. revealed that secretory pathways transport proteins and lipids onto the plasma membrane to repair cell wall/membrane damaged by stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Gupta et al. found that genes involving amino acid metabolism, sugar uptake, membrane transport, and cell wall synthesis were maximally upregulated in isobutanol resistance. Among these, pathways including membrane transport and cell wall synthesis might provide mechanical strength for the strain to withstand extreme pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">ABC transport system are widely distributed in almost all species, and it may serve as import or export machineries of compounds ranging from inorganic ions, amino acids, polysaccharides and antibiotics to peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Feng et al. reported that ABC system exhibited dual functions as an antibiotic efflux pump and a NaCl anti-porter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Combined with the previous report that ABC system participated in removing feedback inhibition of polyketide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], it is reasonable for us to deduce that removing the feedback inhibition of polyketide shared the same molecular mechanism with NaCl-tolerance phenotype; namely, strains with NaCl-tolerance would show resistance to their toxic end-product polyketide, which would allow for increased production of these toxic end-products. Thus, in this study, ALE was applied to improve the saline tolerance of <italic>Bacillus siamensis</italic> A72 (A72) to remove feedback inhibition from MLNs production, thereby improving the yield of MLNs. Successive cultivation in the presence of saline stress, a saline-resistant mutant with enhanced MLNs production was obtained. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanism, we characterized the omics properties of the saline-resistant mutant. The results indicated that amino acid metabolism is a critical factor that attributed to the improvement in MLNs production and biological activity of the saline-resistant mutant strain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Using saline as screening pressure to assist strain evolution</title><p id="Par29">In this study, ALE was applied to develop a mutant strain for improving MLNs production. A72 showing excellent MLNs metabolic performance was selected as the parental strain for ALE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Prior to initiating a random mutant experiment, i.e., ALE, an appropriate screening strategy is a contributing factor that determines whether the whole experiment is a success or not. Based on the above-mentioned deduction, that improving saline resistance of strains might release the feedback inhibition of toxic polyketide, and eventually improving the polyketide production. Thus, in this study, saline stress was used as the screening pressure for improving the MLNs production of A72. To determine the starting saline concentration for the selection of saline-resistant strains, saline ranging from 3 to 10% (w/v) was directly added to the medium, and the growth kinetics was measured. The OD600nm value of A72 decreased by approximately 50% at 6% (w/v) saline concentration (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1), and this concentration was selected as the starting concentration for ALE.</p><p id="Par30">Since the ALE experiment is usually time-consuming, we assembled a simple device assisting A72 evolution to reduce labor intensity. The device consisted of three blue-cap bottles, two pumps, and a water bath (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; container was filled with 1 L of ISP-50 medium supplemented with a specific saline concentration, which supplied the fresh medium for the evolution experiment. The &#x0201c;b&#x0201d; container was set at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and was used for culturing the strains at different saline concentrations. The &#x0201c;c&#x0201d; container was used for collecting discarded evolution cultures.

Cells were inoculated into &#x0201c;<bold>b</bold>&#x0201d; container with 30&#x000a0;mL medium containing x% (w/v) saline, to an initial OD600nm of approximately 0.3, cultured at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and dissolved in oxygen by magnetic bar stirring. When the OD600nm value reached 5.0&#x02013;8.0, approximately 25&#x000a0;mL of the culture was pumped out from the &#x0201c;<bold>b</bold>&#x0201d; container to &#x0201c;<bold>c</bold>&#x0201d; container, and 25&#x000a0;mL of fresh medium from the &#x0201c;<bold>a</bold>&#x0201d; container was pumped into &#x0201c;<bold>b</bold>&#x0201d; container. For each passage, 1.0&#x000a0;mL of the culture was stored in 30% (v/v) glycerol at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for subsequent experiments. When the medium (1000&#x000a0;mL) in &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; container was exhausted, refilled sterile fresh medium with the saline concentration increased by 1%. When the cells could no longer grow at a specific saline concentration in ISP-50-S medium, the ALE experiment was terminated, &#x0201c;n-1&#x0201d; passage cultures were used for selecting desire mutants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12934_2022_1871_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Selecting the robust evolved strains</title><p id="Par31">At the 132<sup>nd</sup> transfer (approximately 60&#x000a0;days of successive evolution), there was minimal cell growth when the saline concentration was increased to 9% (w/v). At this point, we terminated the ALE experiment. The final mutant population corresponding to the 132nd passage was spread onto ISP-2 agar plates, and from the plating, we found two types of colony morphologies on the plates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Of the colonies, 7 of 51 (13.7%) showed a flat, rough, and serrated edge, which is similar to A72, and 44 of 51 (86.4%) were smooth, moist and viscous, milky white. Using ALE to engineer an interesting phenotype, bigger-sized colonies on the screening plates were usually selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The final concentration of stress factor used for the ALE experiment has usually been used for selecting desired mutants (e.g., caffeine- or ethanol-resistant strains) from the evolved population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which leads to our belief that it is easier to select the best-performing mutants at a higher saline level. Thus, to obtain desire mutant strains, the 132nd passage mutant population was spread onto ISP-50 medium plates supplemented with 8% (w/v) saline stress. However, there was not a significant difference in the colony size among the mutants, and as such, it was difficult to select the most robust strains based on colony size under saline stress.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Morphological and physiological characteristics of evolved strains. <bold>A</bold> Comparison of colony morphology between evolved population and parental strain.

Thus, a bacteriostatic circle test was performed to select the most robust mutant based on the bacteriostatic circle size (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). According to the bacteriostatic circle test results, the mutant population showed increased activity against <italic>S. scitamineum</italic> as compared with the parental strain. However, it was still difficult to select the best mutant strain because all bacteriostatic circle sizes were about the same size. The bacteriostatic circle test prompted us to speculate that the mutant population might be derived from a common saline-resistant cell. Thus, three colonies, labeled EV1, EV2, and EV3, were randomly selected from the mutant population for metabolic analysis by HPLC. After 24&#x000a0;h of fermentation in ISP-50 medium at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with a rotation of 200&#x000a0;rpm, the EV1 strain showed the highest production of MLNs among the three strains selected (78.89&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.81) &#x003bc;g/mL, which was a 30.46% improvement compared with A72 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Since we lacked another feasible strategy to select the best strain from mutant population, we subsequently selected EV1 as the best mutant strain and was renamed IMD4001. According to the photomicrographs, the cell length was reduced in IMD4001 as compared with the parental strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2). The 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that IMD4001 has 100% similarity with A72, indicating that IMD4001 was derived from the parental strain A72 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Genetic stability is generally an important consideration for microbial breeding by mutagenesis methods. In this study, the genetic stability of IMD4001 was validated by 20 generations of continuous sub-cultivation in ISP2 medium.</p><p id="Par33">Based on the results, it was reasonable to deduce that all of the strains with a colony morphology change, which accounted for 86.4% of evolved population, had a positive mutation. However, further studies are needed to validate that these changes are regulated by a genome mutation. In summary, although we lacked an effective selecting strategy, we successfully engineered a mutant strain that had enhanced the production of MLNs via ALE using saline as the screening pressure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Characteristics of evolved mutant strain IMD4001</title><p id="Par34">Saline stress tolerance testing was performed by detecting growth kinetics in the presence of 6.0% (w/v) saline. IMD4001 showed a 32.03% improvement in saline tolerance as compared to the parental strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). To test the fermentation characteristics of the evolved strain, IMD4001 and the parental strain A72 were subjected to fermentation tests in flasks. Indices, including growth curves, glucose consumption, and MLNs production from IMD4001 and A72, were compared. It should be noted that the inoculum used was ISP-50 medium containing 3% (w/v) sea salt and 50&#x000a0;g/L glucose, with slight osmotic stress or no stress. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, the MLNs production of IMD4001 (106.89&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) showed a 13.0% improvement as compared with A72 (94.60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL), and the biomass of IMD4001 was slightly higher than that of A72. We speculated that the improvement in saline stress tolerance would confer on IMD4001 better performance in other osmotic stresses, including glucose. Thus, fermentation capacity of parental strain and IMD4001 was evaluated under 70&#x000a0;g/L glucose. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, IMD4001 produced 129.82&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL MLNs, which was approximately 1.71-fold higher than A72. To our surprise, when the glucose concentration in the inoculum was increased from 50 to 70&#x000a0;g/L, IMD4001 showed a 21.5% MLNs production improvement; however, A72 showed a decrease (from 96.6 to 75.9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL). These results confirmed our hypothesis that strains with saline resistance exhibit enhanced MLNs production, and it was feasible to engineer strains with enhanced MLNs production by ALE with saline stress as the screening pressure. Additionally, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, the MLNs concentration of A72 started dropping after 24&#x000a0;h of cultivation. MLNs skeleton synthesis is a process of successive condensation of activated malonyl-CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], which is similar to the fatty acid synthesis, and thus we deduce that MLNs also have a catabolism process that is similar to fatty acid oxidation, which could provide additional ATP for cells to cope with stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In our opinion, 70&#x000a0;g/L glucose is an osmotic stress for A72. In this condition, a large amount of ATP is needed to maintain the cytoplasmic osmotic balance, driving A72 to rely more on MLNs catabolism (or oxidation) for ATP production.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Characteristic analysis results of the parental strain and the mutant strain IMD4001. <bold>A</bold> Saline stress tolerance analysis.

Based on the MLNs yield (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B), it was observed that the yield of MLNs between IMD4001 and A72 was different at 24&#x000a0;h. Thus, samples were collected for RNA-seq analysis at 24&#x000a0;h.

Aside from the GO analysis, we also focused on the metabolic pathways that the DEGs were involved in; hence, all of the DEGs were submitted to the KEGG database. A total of 97 pathways from the KEGG database were enriched.

We initially speculated that amino acid metabolism plays a critical role in improving the production of MLNs in IMD4001.

The short reads was produced on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 sequencer using the pair-end technology (PE 150). Following alignment to the genomic sequence of A72, a total of five mutations were identified in IMD4001 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Among the identified mutations, two &#x0201c;insertion&#x0201d; mutations were found within the intragenic space, two InDels within open reading frames (ORFs) were found, which caused frameshift mutations in two genes, and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) causing a nonsynonymous amino acid change was located in the <italic>hisD</italic> gene, which encodes a histidinal dehydrogenase. Combined with the RNA-seq results, we deduced that the mutation in <italic>hisD</italic> might be the mutation responsible for improving the MLNs production in the mutant, and it was selected for further investigation. Mapping with the reference genome, the 121<sup>st</sup> nucleotide of <italic>hisD</italic> was mutated from G to T, and the corresponding amino acid was transformed from Asp (GAC) to Tyr (TAC). Analysis of the 3D structure of HisD <sup>D41Y</sup> by Discover Studio 4.1, revealed that the mutation site was located at the loop of Lys42-Asp52 and Lys27-Arg37 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

For instance, Mo et al. spent 100&#x000a0;days developing an ethanol-tolerant strain via manual ALE, and the process involved subculturing 450 times in flasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Wang et al. also spent 84&#x000a0;days enhancing the ferulic acid tolerance of <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Hence, ALE is tedious and laborious when using this process to engineer a microorganism with a specific phenotype. Additionally, there is always an inherent risk of contamination when subculturing frequently in flasks, even in a sterile environment. Furthermore, since cell growth is usually used as an indicator of whether a strain with the target phenotype has developed in the parental strain, contaminating bacteria that are resistant to the screening pressure can influence the judgment of the researchers and potentially cause the entire ALE experiment to fail. Thus, avoiding microbial contamination is a top priority during ALE. Based on these considerations, using an assisting device is important for ALE experiment. In this study, we assembled a simple device assisting strain evolution by applying ALE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). With the help of the device, the whole evolution process was almost operated in a closed environment except the &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; container, which was refilled with fresh medium. The closed environment effectively avoided contamination. Moreover, although it still took an extended period (60&#x000a0;days) to create IMD4001 with multiple subculturing (132 times), the subculture operated via the self-made device, which greatly reduced the labor. Thus, the ALE device assembled in this study was labor-saving and contamination-reducing and was also successful in creating a microorganism with the targeted phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Using saline as screening pressure to create a strain with enhanced production of MLNs</title><p id="Par40">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on creating an excellent antibiotic production strain by using ALE with saline as the screening pressure.

According to the change in colony morphology after ARTP treatment, an excellent mutant strain was obtained with a low-screening efficiency of 6.67%. However, this screening strategy could not be applied to the next round of mutant treatment, since the colony morphology did not change after the first round of mutation. To overcome these limitations, we used saline as the screening pressure to create a strain with increased MLNs production via ALE. During the process, evolution was continuously performed until the strains did not grow in a specific saline concentration, and an 86.4% positive mutant proportion was obtained after 60&#x000a0;days of successive batch culture. However, it was still a limitation in this study, and the lack of an effective strategy to select the best performing mutant strains from the evolved population was also a limitation.</p><p id="Par41">During the fermentation process, strains often suffer inhibition from environmental stress.

Consistent with our study, an increased extracellular histidine concentration significantly improved MLNs production (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In <italic>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</italic>, precursors for macrolides synthesis were supplied from branched-chain amino acid degradation pathways and other catabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and macrolides production was strongly influenced when the flux of precursor metabolites was increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Additionally, Liu et al. identified that the regulator, SACE_Lrp, which regulates the transportation and catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, was enhanced in the presence of histidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

Thus, we inferred that amino acids are not only used as a nutrient or precursor for macrolides synthesis but also play an important role in self-resistance in this study. Both glycine-betaine and proline have been reported to function as osmo-protectants in several bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Aside from its use as a protectant, the histidine decarboxylation pathway generates metabolic energy and feeds the proton-motive force for the survival of strains under energy-limiting conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Osmo-protectants have been shown to reduce the susceptibility of strains to antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Thus, it was reasonable to deduce that amino acid metabolism in this study was able to release the feedback inhibition in IMD4001, allowing for increased production of MLNs.

In addition, the combination of ARTP mutagenesis and ALE has been successfully applied to breed desired phenotype of strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In this study, cells undergo two types of DNA mutation, namely, ARTP mutation and adaptive mutation, 6% saline was used to screen the saline stress-resistant mutants from the ARTP-mutagenized population. At this point, the ARTP mutants with saline stress tolerance were enriched, and they were used as the parental strains for the following adaptive experiment. Since there was a low-frequency spontaneous mutation in cell life process, repeating the screening experiment at increasingly higher saline concentrations helped enrich the spontaneous mutation, which is beneficial to strain tolerance improvement.</p><p id="Par49">The ARTP-mutagenized population was used as the initial cell pool for evolving saline-resistant mutants by ALE, using saline as the screening pressure. First, the initial saline concentration (x%) used in the evolutionary selection experiments was determined. A72 was inoculated into 5&#x000a0;mL of ISP-50 containing a gradient concentration of saline in a 50-mL, screw-cap tube to an initial optical density at 600&#x000a0;nm (OD600nm) of 0.1 and cultured at 30&#x000ba;C at 200&#x000a0;rpm. After incubating for 24&#x000a0;h, the OD600nm values of the cultures were measured by a visible spectrophotometer (Jingke 721G-100, Shanghai, China). A72 growth was inhibited at 6% (w/v) stress level (Fig. S1), which was then selected as the initial concentration for evolutionary screening. To reduce the labor intensity of ALE, a simple device was assembled (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). During the ALE experiment process, batch cultivation mode was selected, which was operated as follows: The ARTP-mutagenized cells were inoculated into the &#x0201c;b&#x0201d; container with 30&#x000a0;mL of fresh ISP-50-S to an initial OD600nm value of approximately 0.3, cultured at 30&#x000ba;C, and dissolved in oxygen by magnetic bar stirring. When cells passed at exponential phase of growth in the &#x0201c;b&#x0201d; container (the OD600nm value reached 5.0&#x02013;8.0), approximately 25&#x000a0;mL of the culture was pumped out of the &#x0201c;b&#x0201d; container, and 1&#x000a0;mL of the culture was stored in 30% (v/v) glycerol at&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. To obtain the next passage, a total of 25&#x000a0;mL of fresh ISP-50-S medium from the &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; container was supplemented through Pump 2 at one time, and cultured at 30&#x000ba;C until the OD600 value reached 5.0&#x02013;8.0. After approximately 40 generations of batch cultivation, the ISP-50-S medium (1000&#x000a0;mL) in the &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; container was exhausted, and the container was then refilled with sterile ISP-50-S with the saline concentration increased by 1%, which was then used for the next stress level for screening. When the cells could no longer grow at a specific saline concentration in ISP-50-S medium, the ALE experiment was terminated.</p><p id="Par50">The whole ALE experiment was monitored. At the 30th transfer, biofilm formation was observed on the vessel &#x0201c;b&#x0201d; wall.
