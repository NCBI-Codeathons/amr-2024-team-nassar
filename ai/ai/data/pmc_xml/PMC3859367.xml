A-factor, a C<sub>13</sub><italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-butyrolactone compound, was discovered as a self-regulatory factor or a bacterial hormone to induce morphological differentiation and production of secondary metabolites, including streptomycin, in this organism. Accumulating evidence has revealed an A-factor-triggered signal cascade, which is composed of several key steps or components. These include: (i) AfsA catalyzing a crucial step of A-factor biosynthesis, (ii) the A-factor-specific receptor (ArpA), which acts as a transcriptional repressor for <italic>adpA</italic>, (iii) <italic>adpA</italic>, a sole target of ArpA, which encodes a global transcriptional activator AdpA, and (iv) a variety of members of the AdpA regulon, a set of the genes regulated by AdpA. A-factor is biosynthesized via five reaction steps, in which AfsA catalyzes acyl transfer between a <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein and the hydroxyl group of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The receptor ArpA, belonging to the TetR family, is a homodimer, each subunit of which contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and an A-factor-binding pocket. The three-dimensional structure and conformational change upon binding A-factor are elucidated, on the basis of X-ray crystallography of CprB, an ArpA homologue. AdpA, belonging to the AraC/XylS transcriptional activator family, binds operators upstream from the promoters of a variety of the target genes and activates their transcription, thus forming the AdpA regulon. Members of the AdpA regulon includes the pathway-specific transcriptional activator gene <italic>strR</italic> that activates the whole streptomycin biosynthesis gene cluster, in addition to a number of genes that direct the multiple cellular functions required for cellular differentiation in a concerted manner. A variety of A-factor homologues as well as homologues of <italic>afsA</italic>/<italic>arpA</italic> are distributed widely among <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, indicating the significant role of this type of molecular signaling in the ecosystem and evolutional processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>A-factor</kwd><kwd><italic>Streptomyces</italic></kwd><kwd>morphological differentiation</kwd><kwd>secondary metabolism</kwd><kwd>A-factor receptor</kwd><kwd>streptomycin biosynthesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The Gram-positive, soil-inhabiting, filamentous bacterial genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic> shows a characteristic life cycle with complex morphological development resembling that of filamentous fungi. <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is also characterized by its ability to produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites, including a number of antibiotics and other biologically active substances. For example, even a single species of <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic> is known to produce not only streptomycin but also about 180 other secondary metabolites. In fact, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is one of the most important microbial resources for discovering novel functions useful in a variety of biotechnology, such as medicinal, agricultural, and industrial applications. <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is therefore called a &#x0201c;natural reservoir of structurally complex compounds on the earth.&#x0201d; Lines of evidence have shown that the morphological differentiation and secondary metabolism in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> are closely correlated with each other as a facet of the cellular differentiation processes, and therefore this genus has been one of the model organisms to study molecular mechanisms for multicellular differentiation in prokaryotes. Among them, <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> A3(2) has been the <italic>de facto</italic> standard strain owing to the excellent genetic systems developed by D. A. Hopwood, which greatly facilitate the detailed molecular genetic analyses and result in large accumulation of genetic information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-83_277">1)</xref></sup> An additional species is <italic>S. griseus</italic>, whose streptomycin production and aerial mycelium formation are simultaneously triggered by a diffusible self-regulatory substance called A-factor, a representative of the chemical signaling &#x003b3;-butyrolactone compounds that control the cellular differentiation in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-83_277">2)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-83_277">4)</xref></sup></p><p>A-factor, a 13-carbon (C<sub>13</sub>) <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-butyrolactone compound, was originally discovered by a Russian scientist, A. S. Khokhlov, in the 1960s as a diffusible self-regulatory factor in <italic>S. griseus</italic>, which simultaneously induces sporulation and streptomycin production in the same organism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-83_277">5)</xref></sup> The pioneer work of Khokhlov, however, had long been neglected, partly because isolation of the mutants deficient in the diffusible factor with an extremely low effective concentration (10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M) was technically difficult and such mutants were easily overlooked in the routine genetic work, but more probably because an unconscious barrier existed even in science during the cold war era. In 1980, O. Hara and T. Beppu studied marked genetic instability of the industrial streptomycin-producing strain of <italic>S. griseus</italic> and found that a characteristic pleiotropic mutant deficient in both streptomycin production and sporulation appeared at abnormally high frequencies exceeding about 10%. Cross-feeding experiments between colonies of the mutant and the parental strain revealed that both the defects in this group of mutants were simultaneously restored by a highly diffusible substance secreted by the parental strain. This finding quickly revived the Khokhlov&#x02019;s famous but ignored works in their mind and led them to the rediscovery of A-factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-83_277">6)</xref></sup> Subsequent study has established the molecular mechanisms of the A-factor regulatory cascade consisted of a specific receptor and a set of transcriptional activators to control secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation in <italic>S. griseus</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-83_277">2)</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-83_277">4)</xref></sup></p><p>A-factor homologues with a <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-butyrolactone ring have been found as similar self-regulatory factors for secondary metabolism in a number of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species and its related genera, which has thus opened a novel paradigm of the characteristic regulatory system for cellular differentiation in prokaryotes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-83_277">2)</xref></sup> On the other hand, similar diffusible factors, <italic>N</italic>-acylhomoserine lactones also having a <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-butyrolactone ring, were found as autoinducers for diverged cellular functions such as bioluminescence and toxin production in several Gram-negative bacteria, which have now been recognized as signaling molecules involved in the so-called quorum sensing for cell-cell communication in various species belonging to Proteobacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-83_277">7)</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-83_277">8)</xref></sup> In spite of the apparent similarity in chemical structure between these two groups of signaling molecules, their biosynthetic pathways, as well as the genes involved in regulation by the respective signals, are distinctly different, indicating that these two regulatory systems have evolved from different ancestors.

Partial apoptotic lysis of substrate mycelium is accompanied by the appearance of aerial mycelia or hyphae growing into the air. After septa have been formed at regular intervals along the hyphae, long chains of uninucleoid spores are formed. The primary decision point for morphological differentiation in this life cycle is the step to form aerial mycelium, and genetic blocks at this point generate a bald (<italic>bld</italic>) phenotype of colonies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-83_277">1)</xref></sup> Biosynthesis of not only streptomycin but also other secondary metabolites, such as grixazone (a yellow pigment)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-83_277">9)</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-83_277">10)</xref></sup> and a melanin-like pigment named hexahydroxyperylenequinone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-83_277">11)</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-83_277">12)</xref></sup> also starts at this step, suggesting that the same switch is involved in the initiation of secondary metabolism in this species.

The assumption directly led to the idea that a specific receptor might be involved in the regulation by A-factor, which was confirmed as described below. Ligand specificity of the putative receptor was thought to explain the narrow activity of A-factor restricted only to <italic>S. griseus</italic> among various species of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. In fact, several <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-butyrolactone homologues have been found as self-regulatory factors for secondary metabolism in some <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species, all of which show strict species specificities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-83_277">13)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-83_277">15)</xref></sup> An extremely low effective concentration of A-factor facilitates to exert its activity between different portions of hyphae or colonies at a distance to induce rapid and simultaneous sporulation and production of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites.

An overall view of the cascade is as follows.</p><fig id="f2-83_277" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The A-factor regulatory cascade leading to morphological development and secondary metabolite production.

The A-factor receptor ArpA has dual abilities to bind A-factor as a specific ligand and to bind a specific DNA sequence in the promoter of <italic>adpA</italic> as a transcriptional repressor. Binding of A-factor to DNA-bound ArpA causes its immediate dissociation from the promoter to initiate transcription and translation of <italic>adpA</italic>. The gene product AdpA then activates a number of genes belonging to the AdpA regulon by binding the consensus sequences located upstream of their promoters in most cases, which are required for secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation. In the case of streptomycin biosynthesis, <italic>strR</italic>, a member of the AdpA regulon located within the streptomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, is activated, and StrR in turn induces transcription of all the genes within the cluster.</p><p>In this signaling system, a single signal pathway starting from the receptor ArpA is divided into diverged multiple targets involved in various cellular functions required for secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation. This characteristic feature is based primarily on the fact that the target of ArpA is limited only to a single global transcriptional activator gene <italic>adpA</italic>, which possesses highly multiple target genes to be controlled. It makes a sharp contrast to the feature of most <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-butyrolactone signals in other <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species; a pair of <italic>afsA</italic>/<italic>arpA</italic> homologues in most <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species is linked to a biosynthesis gene cluster for a certain secondary metabolite and it controls only production of the secondary metabolite (see below).

AfsA catalyzes a new type of acyl transfer between 8-methyl-3-oxononanoyl-ACP (<xref rid="f3-83_277" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; <bold>3</bold>) and the hydroxyl group of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) (<bold>2</bold>), forming a fatty acid ester (<bold>4</bold>). The ester (<bold>4</bold>) is non-enzymatically converted to a butenolide phosphate (<bold>5</bold>) by intramolecular aldol condensation, which is then reduced to a butanolide phosphate (<bold>6</bold>) in the presence of NADPH. The BprA product showing similarity to oxidoreductases, which is encoded by <italic>bprA</italic> just downstream of <italic>afsA</italic>, was tested as a reductase responsible for this reduction, on the assumption that functionally related genes are in most cases encoded as a gene cluster. This assumption turned out to be true and BprA actually reduced the butenolide phosphate (<bold>5</bold>) to yield the butanolide phosphate (<bold>6</bold>) with the <italic>R</italic>-form stereospecificity at position 3. The phosphate group on the resulting butanolide (<bold>6</bold>) is finally removed by a phosphatase, resulting in the formation of A-factor (<bold>1</bold>). There is an alternative pathway, in which the phosphate group on the fatty acid ester (<bold>4</bold>) is first removed by a phosphatase and the dephosphorylated ester (<bold>7</bold>) is converted non-enzymatically to a butenolide (<bold>8</bold>), which is then reduced by a reductase different from BprA, resulting in A-factor (<bold>1</bold>). The phosphatase and reductase in the latter route are not specific to A-factor biosynthesis but generally present in bacteria.

Site 2 therefore serves as the operators for both ArpA and AdpA. AdpA bound to a strong binding site 1 increases the affinity for AdpA of a weak site 2, probably by forming a DNA loop <italic>via</italic> the two molecules of AdpA dimer, thus preventing RNA polymerase from access to the promoter.

When the intracellular concentration of AdpA exceeds an appropriate level required for ordered gene expression in a concerted manner, the AdpA dimer bound to site 1 recruits another AdpA dimer to a rather weak binding site 2, thus forming a DNA loop in a way that RNA polymerase cannot gain access to the promoter.

In 1979, he joined Bernard Weisblum&#x02019;s laboratory, Pharmacology Department, University of Wisconsin, as Research Associate to study inducible resistance to MLS (macrolides, licosamides, and streptogramin type B) and proposed a mechanism of translational attenuation by which Gram-positive pathogens show inducible MLS resistance. This is a famous mechanism, in which conformational changes of mRNA to disclose a ribosome-binding site and the initiation codon determine the translational level of gene expression of the MLS resistance gene. He got a position as Assistant Professor at Department of Agricultural Chemistry, The University of Tokyo in 1981, where he was further promoted as Associate Professor in 1987 and Professor in 1994. He was Director of the Biotechnology Research Center of The University of Tokyo from 2003 to 2005. His research field has been microbial biotechnology, especially focusing on the regulation and application of antibiotic production by actinomycetes. He has served as President of the Society for Actinomycetes, Japan since 2004. He was awarded the Sumiki-Umezawa Memorial Award in 1991, the Society for Actinomycetes, Japan Award in 1993, the Kei Arima Memorial Award from the Japan Bioindustry Association in 2004, and the Japan Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry Society Award in 2006.</p><fig id="f9-83_277" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="83_277f9"/></fig></bio><bio id="d35e5732"><title>Profile</title><p>Teruhiko Beppu was born in 1934 in Tokyo. He is currently a member of Japan Academy since 2004 as well as Professor Emeritus of the University of Tokyo and Professor of Advanced Research Institute for the Sciences and Humanities in Nihon University. He started his research careers at the University of Tokyo, where he obtained PhD in 1957, and worked as Professor of Fermentation and Microbiology at Department of Agricultural Chemistry during 1977&#x02013;1994. His research activity during this period covered rather wide fields from basic and applied microbiology to enzymology and eukaryotic cell biology, the accomplishments of which are exemplified by (i) the first cloning and expression of calf prochymosin cDNA for production as a milk-coagulant in cheese industry, (ii) discovery of unique bioactive microbial products, such as trichostatin (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) and leptomycin (an inhibitor of nuclear pore transport), and (iii) rediscovery of A-factor and elucidation of its mechanism to control cellular differentiation in the streptomycin-producing bacterium, <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic>. In the last topic, Prof. S. Horinouchi, the coauthor of this review article, had been a close coworker since almost its beginning. In 1994, TB moved to College of Bioresource Sciences, Nihon University, and started a pioneering work on microbial symbiosis, which was supported as a 21st Century Center of Excellence Research Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.</p><p>According to these achievements and efforts, he received several awards such as the Award of the Society of Agricultural Chemistry in 1986, the Charles Tom Award of the Society of Industrial Microbiology, U.S.A. in 1995, the Purple Ribbon Medal in 1996, and the Japan Academy Prize in 1998. He was also involved in several social activities such as Chairman of the Japan Bioindustry Association during 2003&#x02013;2007.</p><fig id="f10-83_277" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="83_277f10"/></fig></bio></back></article>
