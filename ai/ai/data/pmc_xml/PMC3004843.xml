Leading glycopeptide drugs are vancomycin and teicoplanin, produced by the actinomycetes <italic>Amycolatopsis orientalis </italic>and <italic>Actinoplanes teichomyceticus</italic>, respectively. The actinomycete <italic>Amycolatopsis balhimycina </italic>DSM5908, which produces the vancomycin-like antibiotic balhimycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], has been investigated as model strain for studies on glycopeptide biosynthesis since it can be genetically modified and the sequence of <italic>bal </italic>cluster, containing genes devoted to balhimycin biosynthesis, is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Balhimycin consists of a heptapeptide core made of the proteinogenic amino acids Leu and Asn and the nonproteinogenic amino acids 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DPG), 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (HPG) and &#x003b2;-hydroxytyrosine (H-Tyr). This heptapeptide is assembled by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and then extensively modified by the so called tailoring reactions, such as oxidative cross-linking of the electron-rich aromatic side chains, halogenation, glycosylation and methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In Actinomycetes, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites like antibiotics is generally elicited as developmental program and physiological response to a variety of environmental stimuli, including high cell density, nutritional limitation and/or presence of stress-inducing agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In <italic>A. orientalis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and <italic>A. balhimycina </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] cultivations, performed using minimal defined media, glucose amount was revealed positively correlated with antibiotic biosynthesis, cell growth rate and biomass production. On the other hand, inorganic phosphate (Pi) limitation is known to negatively affect growth rate and biomass production but to be beneficial for the production of glycopeptide antibiotics as shown for vancomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], A40926 (produced by <italic>Nonomuraea </italic>ATCC 39727) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and balhimycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Pi limitation negatively controls the expression of both primary and secondary metabolism genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In Streptomycetes, Pi-controlled regulatory elements, called PHO boxes, have been reported in the upstream region of Pho regulon genes, which are devoted to Pi-nutritional stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The PHO boxes are targets of PhoP, a transcriptional regulator whose activity is regulated by the phosphate-sensing membrane protein PhoR. PhoP is reported to have a dual role acting as either positive or negative regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although balhimycin biosynthesis has been extensively studied, the molecular bases of limitation of nutrients, such as Pi and glucose, controlling primary metabolism and antibiotic biosynthesis have not been investigated yet.</p><p>Proteomics was proven useful to identify specific biochemical pathways (or parts thereof) and key enzymes to be further targeted in genetic manipulations aimed to maximize the conversion of substrates into useful end-products in microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In this context, we have recently used a differential proteomic approach to demonstrate that balhimycin production in batch culture is associated with the upregulation of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotic precursors, thus suggesting that the metabolic apparatus is orientated to sustain balhimycin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Accordingly, an increased precursor availability, in particular tyrosine, was recently showed to be beneficial for balhimycin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Up to date, few experimental studies on antibiotic production have focused attention on continuous cultures, although the advantages of this type of study of microbial physiology have been recognized for many years. In fact, this approach provides useful means of researching the relationships between physiological <italic>status </italic>of an organism and production of antibiotics by comparing highly reproducible steady-state conditions, where growth parameters (i.e. biomass production yield, growth rate, carbon source uptake, O<sub>2 </sub>consumption, CO<sub>2 </sub>and metabolite production) and medium components are constant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In this study, chemostat cultures of <italic>A. balhimycina </italic>were used to obtain steady-state conditions for biomass accumulation with the same growth rate and with or without balhimycin production. These cultivations were then analyzed by a comparative proteomic study to elucidate changes in the expression of genes involved in <italic>A. balhimycina </italic>primary and secondary metabolism which are associated with biomass production and antibiotic synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Chemostat cultivation profile</title><p>Preliminary <italic>A. balhimycina </italic>batch cultivations, performed using a minimal defined medium containing glucose as only carbon source, revealed that to generate 1 g/l of biomass dry weight (BDW) about 3 g/l of glucose and 0.3 mM of Pi are necessary in a balanced growth. Thus, two minimal defined media, one with low Pi (0.6 mM; LP) and proficient glucose (12 g/l) concentrations and the other one with high Pi (1.8 mM) and limiting (6 g/l; LG) glucose concentrations, were developed to perform <italic>A. balhimycina </italic>chemostat cultivations. Appling a dilution rate of 0.03 h<sup>-1 </sup>a highly reproducible and stable steady-state was achieved in both conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>: panels A and B), revealing that mycelia grew with the same rate and with a similar biomass production yield, calculated on consumed glucose, i.e. 0.38 &#x000b1; 0.02 and 0.33 &#x000b1; 0.02 g/g (BDW/glucose) in LG and LP, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel C). In these systems, residual Pi and glucose concentrations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> panels A and B) were close to zero during steady-state, thus revealing that glucose and Pi, continuously introduced by feeding in, are completely up-taken during constant growth. Despite the similar glucose-biomass conversion coefficients, CO<sub>2 </sub>production yield, normalized to BDW, was about 1.4 fold higher in LP than in LG condition Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> panel D). This result indicates an increased metabolism throughout TCA cycle in LP. Interestingly, as demonstrated by HPLC analysis, balhimycin was revealed only in LP condition, showing a productivity of 0.03 mg/g/h (balhimycin/BDW/time), and the antibiotic on-set coincided with CO<sub>2 </sub>production yield increment Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> panel B). Conversely, LG condition resulted in a complete inhibition of antibiotic production.

In particular, glycolytic enzymes glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (PgiA), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FDA), PP-dependent-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (P-PFK), enolase (ENO) and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex members (two dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases, LpdA1 and 2, and one dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase, SucB) were upregulated in LP condition.

In fact, pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, from glycolysis, erytrose-4P, from PPP, and alpha-ketoacids from TCA cycle are required for anabolic routes such as amino acid biosynthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, the upregulation of central carbon metabolism enzymes does not result in an increased biomass production yield, calculated on glucose consumption, in LP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This result is most probably due to Pi limitation that negatively affects growth. On the contrary, the Pi proficiency in LG is counterbalanced by the low glucose availability that results in downregulation of central carbon metabolism enzymes. Thus, the similar biomass production yield in LP and LG conditions is achieved throughout a differential expression of central carbon metabolism key enzymes that provides for metabolic adaptation to energetic imbalance due to Pi limitation in LP condition and leads to an increased synthesis of primary metabolism intermediates and cofactors eventually required for biomass production and for balhimycin biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Fatty acid metabolism</title><p>Two long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligases, namely L-ACS1 and 2, were upregulated and downregulated in LP, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Table 3S). Both are involved in the reversible formation of an acyl-carrier protein in the metabolism of fatty acids, with a mechanism leading to the release of PPi from ATP. In addition, the enzyme enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI), catalyzing the formation of trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-[acyl-carrier protein] and NADH from NAD<sup>+ </sup>and enoyl-acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] C4-16 derivatives, was upregulated in LP. This result is in agreement to Summers <italic>et al</italic>., (1999) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] that revealed <italic>fabI </italic>being part of an operon induced in Pi limited cultures of <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic>.

In fact, upregulation was revealed for NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase proteins (NuoE and NuoD), 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase (GcpE), involved in the synthesis of isopentenyl-PP that is a precursor of CoQ, AhpC, a thiol-specific antioxidant protein using reducing equivalents derived from either thioredoxin (TrxR) and glutathione, and TrxR, a small protein that alters the redox state of target proteins through the reversible oxidation of its active site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Table 3S).

This is the case of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), trigger factor (TF), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPI), a cold shock-like protein (CSP-G), chaperone protein DnaK and Clp protease ATP-binding subunit (ClpB). In contrast, 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL and 30 S ribosomal protein S1 RpsA were downregulated under LP conditions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Table 3S), as reported also in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>coelicolor </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], in <italic>B. subtilis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and in <italic>S. meliloti </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] incubated in Pi limiting condition. This result correlates with the chemostat cultivation conditions used, where mycelia are in a proliferating state and in LP a pool of upregulated factors, required for protein biosynthesis, may need to counterbalance energetic stress due to Pi limitation. In fact, the upregulation of factors necessary for either ribosomal activity or for protein folding together with the concomitant downregulation of the ribosomal protein RpsA, the largest ribosomal component with a pivotal role in ribosome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], may reflect the need to optimize the efficiency of protein biosynthesis under Pi nutritional stress conditions.</p><p>Under Pi limitation, bacteria may reduce their nucleoside pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and accordingly inosine 5'-phosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), whose activity is required for the biosynthesis of xanthosine-5'P, a precursor of both guanosine and adenosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], was downregulated in LP. Surprisingly, guanosine 5'-phosphate (GMP) synthase, whose activity is associated with the formation of GMP and PPi from xantosine-5'P, was instead upregulated LP. This result might be explained since, as shown in KEGG pathway database, GMP synthase substrate (xanthosine-5'P) could derive from biochemical routes involving a pool of xantine and xantosine-triP or-tetraPi, in a salvage pathway that could be activated in Pi limitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Balhimycin production</title><p>The amino acids H-Tyr, HPG, DPG, Asn and Leu are necessary to form the balhimycin heptapeptide backbone. Their availability from primary metabolism pathways is crucial for antibiotic biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Non-proteinogenic amino acids H-Tyr and HPG are also derived from metabolism of Tyr, which is also the amino donor during DPG biosynthesis. Genes encoding enzymes involved in the last steps of H-Tyr, HPG and DPG biosynthesis are present in the <italic>bal </italic>cluster, which also contain genes coding for enzymes required in the metabolism of amino sugars, essential for antibiotic glycosylation.</p><p>In agreement with balhimycin production observed only in LP, primary and secondary metabolism enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of balhimycin precursors, such as amino acids and amino sugars resulted upregulated in LP condition. In particular, the metabolic building blocks pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, oxalacetate, 4P-erythrose and glucose-6P from central carbon metabolism are required for Leu, DPG, Asn, Tyr, HPG and amino sugar biosynthesis, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, <italic>bal </italic>gene product HmaS-involved in HPG synthesis and whose expression was revealed upregulated by qRT-PCR-, 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase large subunit (LeuC) and branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (IlvE)-catalyzing different reactions in Leu biosynthesis-, MDH-catalyzing biosynthesis of Asp-precursor oxalacetate-, <italic>bal </italic>gene product Bgtf, phosphoglucosamine mutase (GlmM) and UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GalU)-required in the metabolism of amino sugars-were upregulated in LP. GlmM is particularly interesting because it catalyzes the formation of glucosamine-1P, a metabolic intermediate that is converted into UDP-glucosamine from GalU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Table 3S). UDP-glucosamine is reported to be likely the primary metabolism building block required for the biosynthesis of modified amino sugars in glycopeptide teicoplanin, chloroeremomycin, and balhimycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Interestingly, a 4-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPT) was upregulated in LP. PPTs form a superfamily of enzymes that transfer prosthetic 4-phosphopantetheine moiety from CoA to carrier domain of biosynthetic complexes required for the synthesis of a wide range of compounds including fatty acid, polyketide (PK) and nonribosomal peptide (NRP) metabolites. As revealed by BLAST analysis, <italic>A. balhimycina </italic>PPT possesses conserved domains characteristic of Sfp-like phosphopantetheinyl transferases family. Members of this family are mainly found associated either with NRP synthetase and PK synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Thus, even if an involvement in fatty acid biosynthesis could not be totally excluded, PPT might likely be involved in both balhimycin heptapeptide assembly line and in the synthesis of DPG, a polyketide derivative, synthesized by <italic>dpgABCD </italic>products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>Altogether, these data suggest that the destination of metabolic intermediates in LP and LG cultivations is differentially regulated. In particular, the increment of glucose catabolism in LP condition is coupled with the synthesis of metabolic building blocks related to the generation of both balhimycin backbone and amino sugar moieties.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of PHO box regulatory elements in the upstream of differentially expressed genes</title><p>Global gene expression analysis was proven as a good starting point to identify common regulatory elements, such as PHO boxes, in the upstream region of differentially expressed genes in <italic>S. coelicolor </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Searches were carried out by using a mass tolerance value of 2.0 Da for precursor ion and 0.8 Da for MS/MS fragments, trypsin as proteolytic enzyme, a missed cleavages maximum value of 2. Other SEQUEST parameters were kept as default. Candidates with more than 2 assigned peptides with an individual SEQUEST score versus charge state &#x0003e; 1.5 for charged state (CS) 1, &#x0003e; 2.0 for CS 2, &#x0003e; 2.4 for CS 3, &#x0003e; 3.3 for CS 4, &#x0003e; 4.2 for CS 5, &#x0003e; 4.5 for CS 6 were considered confidently identified.

The mycelia were resuspended in 1 ml P-buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] containing lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and RNase inhibitor RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) (40 U/ml), and then incubated for 10 min, at 37&#x000b0;C. The RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNase I (Roche) treatment was performed at 37&#x000b0;C, for 1 h, and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.1 vol of 3 M sodium acetate allowed recovery of the DNase-treated total RNA. After a washing step with 70% (v/v) ethanol and air drying, the RNA pellet was resuspended in water with RNase inhibitor RNaseOUT (200 U/ml). As control of RNA quality, a RT-PCR with 0.1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA and primer pairs internal to <italic>hrdB </italic>was carried out using the Superscript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) and the conditions indicated by the supplier.

The expression of <italic>hrdB</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] was used as an internal control to quantify the relative expression of target genes. 2 &#x003bc;l of cDNAs were mixed with 12.5 &#x003bc;l of SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystem) and 10 pmol of each primer in a final volume of 25 &#x003bc;l. The PCR was performed under the following conditions: 2 min at 50&#x000b0;C and 10 min at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95&#x000b0;C and 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C. A dissociation reaction was eventually performed using a temperature gradient from 55 to 99&#x000b0;C by increasing 1&#x000b0;C/min. This procedure permitted recording the melting curve of the PCR products and, consequently, their specificity to be determined. A negative control (distilled water) was included in all real-time PCR assays, and each experiment was performed in triplicate or quadruplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Search for putative PHO box sequences</title><p><italic>A. balhimycina </italic>PHO box sequences were searched by matching two directs repeats (<bold>gttcacccggc </bold>and <bold>gttcatttacg</bold>) of <italic>S. coelicolor </italic>PHO box in the upstream region of <italic>pstS </italic>gene with regions extending 300 bp upstream of the putative translation start sites of differentially expressed <italic>A. balhimycina </italic>genes.
