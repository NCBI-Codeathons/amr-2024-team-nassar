Besides as potent anti-cancer agents, CPT and its derivatives are now being explored as potential pesticides for insect control. In this study, we assessed their toxicity to an insect homolog, the Topo1 protein from beet armyworms (<italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic> H&#x000fc;bner), a worldwide pest of many important crops. The <italic>S. exigua Topo1</italic> gene contains an ORF of 2790 base pairs that is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 930 amino acids. The deduced polypeptide exhibits polymorphism at residue sites V420, L530, A653 and T729 (numbered according to human Topo1) among insect species, which are predicted to confer sensitivity to CPT. The DNA relaxation activity of this protein was subsequently examined using a truncated form that contained the residues 337&#x02013;930 and was expressed in bacteria BL21 cells. The purified protein retained the ability to relax double-stranded DNA and was susceptible to CPT and its derivative hydroxy-camptothecin (HCPT) in a dose-dependent manner. The same inhibitory effect was also found on the native Topo1 extracted from IOZCAS-Spex-II cells, a cell line established from beet armyworms. Additionally, CPT and HCPT treatment reduced the steady accumulation of Topo1 protein despite the increased mRNA expression in response to the treatment. Our studies provide information of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>exigua</italic> Topo1 gene and its amino acid polymorphism in insects and uncover some clues about potential mechanisms of CPT toxicity against insect pests. These results also are useful for development of more effective Topo1-targeted CPT insecticides in the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31000851 and 31071707).

A potent inhibitor of this class of enzymes is camptothecin (CPT), a plant alkaloid isolated originally from the Chinese tree, <italic>Camptotheca acuminate</italic> Decne.

In addition, two of its classic derivatives, irinotecan and topotecan, have been used for treatment of various cancers throughout the world, and meanwhile some CPT analogues are currently used at various stages of clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0056458-Pommier2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Although CPT was not known till 1966 during a discovery screening of natural products for anti-cancer drugs, the crude extract of <italic>C. acuminate</italic> that contains the now-known CPT has been traditionally used to control pests in ancient China for centuries. CPT and its derivatives are now being explored as a class of botanical insecticide in agriculture. CPT is a potent chemosterilant against houseflies <xref rid="pone.0056458-DeMilo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It also exhibits significant genotoxicity to fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Meigen), which acts through promoting homologous and illegitimate recombination, as well as the whole chromosome loss by clastogenicity, deeply elucidating essential functions of Topo1 in embyrogenesis, oogenesis, larva and pupal growth <xref rid="pone.0056458-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056458-Sortibrn1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Recently, CPT has been shown to be toxic to several other agricultural pests like brown plant hoppers (<italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> St&#x000e5;l), striped rice borers (<italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic> Walker), cabbage aphids (<italic>Brevicoryn brassicae</italic> Linnaeus) and small citrus trypetids (<italic>Bactrocera dorsali</italic> Hendel) <xref rid="pone.0056458-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056458-Zou1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To find new CPT-derived insecticides with improved efficacy and to determine the potential structural factors required for the biological activity of CPT analogues, a series of novel CPT derivatives have been semi-synthesized, and some of them were found toxic to armyworms (<italic>Mythimna separate</italic> Walker) and coconut palm beetles (<italic>Brontispa longissima</italic> Gestro) <xref rid="pone.0056458-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056458-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In our previous studies, we found that 0.1&#x02013;30 &#x000b5;M CPT treatment to IOZCAS -Spex-II cells (established from beet armyworms, <italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic> H&#x000fc;bner) induce cell apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0056458-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Thus, these previous findings intrigue us to explore CPT as a lead compound of an insect control agent, and to investigate the possibility of exploring a new Topo1-targeted botanical insecticide.</p><p>Despite efforts on the toxicity of CPT to agricultural pests, very limited studies have been focused on insect Topo1s except the fruit fly (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0056458-Sortibrn1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056458-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056458-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and it has remained yet clear of whether CPT cytotoxicity to insect cells is closely associated with <italic>Topo1</italic> gene expression and Topo1 enzyme activity. Here, we isolated and characterized the beet armyworm <italic>Topo1</italic> gene and evaluated the susceptibility of Topo1 to CPT and its derivative hydroxyl-camptothecin (HCPT). We found that the Topo1 protein, when either purified as a recombinant protein from bacteria or extracted from IOZCAS-Spex-II cells, was susceptible to both CPT and HCPT. Moreover, pretreatment with CPT and HCPT led to reduction in both the enzymatic activity and the steady accumulation of the Topo1 protein in IOZCAS-Spex-II cells despite up-regulation of its mRNA expression in response to the treatment. These results offer important information for understanding CPT-toxicity against insects from the point of adaptive evolution and molecular toxicology and have implications in designing potent Topo1-based pesticides with high-performance and environment safety.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of S. exigua Topo1 Sequence</title><p>To isolate the <italic>S. exigua Topo1</italic> gene, three sets of degenerate primers targeting the conserved regions of eukaryotic <italic>Topo1</italic> genes were employed to amplify the <italic>Topo1</italic> coding region.

CPT and its derivatives with a closed E ring are more effective than those with an open E ring <xref rid="pone.0056458-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Our results showed that both CPT and HCPT exhibited a dose- and time- dependent effect on Topo1 enzyme activity. Because the lactone form of the E ring in HCPT is preferentially pH-dependent, HCPT showed lower inhibitory effects <italic>in vitro</italic> than CPT in a reaction buffer of pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056458-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056458-g006">6</xref>).

These results suggest that CPT is more toxic to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>exigua</italic> Topo1 than HCPT.

Topo1 intensity in the nucleoli dropped in less than 2 min and it accumulated in the cytoplasm up to 5 hours in a CPT dose-dependent manner. Topo1 protein was finally degraded into detectable fragments of &#x0223c;40 kD in the nucleus and then Topo1 fragments exited the nucleus into cytoplasm <xref rid="pone.0056458-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

Although the degraded fragments of Topo1 proteins were not detected both in cytosolic and nuclear fractions, the down-regulation of Topo1 protein explained well the decreased enzymatic activity.
