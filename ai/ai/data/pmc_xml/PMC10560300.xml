In this experiment, the arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal network was established among <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> plants, and a two plant three-compartment culture model was established.

(Can be abbreviated as <italic>S. milliorrhiza</italic>) is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine in China. Its rhizome is used as medicine and has medicinal values such as activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, improving heart function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and delaying aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. With the research on the pharmacological effects of <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic>, the market demand for <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> is increasing, the planting regulations of <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> are expanding, and the phenomenon of root diseases and pests caused by continuous cropping is becoming more prominent. Relevant studies showed that with the gradual rise of the prevalence of root rot of <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic>, the yield, and quality of <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> showed a significant downward trend<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, the soil-borne diseases mainly caused by the root rot of <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> have seriously endangered and restricted the further development and utilization of <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> resources.</p><p id="Par3">Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi are a kind of soil fungi that widely exist in nature and coexist with plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that inoculation of AM fungi on plants significantly improves the disease resistance of host plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and has a certain inhibitory effect after the occurrence of soil-borne diseases on plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Plants can combine with AM fungi to form mutualistic symbionts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The extraradicular hyphae of AM fungi can infect the adjacent roots of <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> and carry out hyphal fusion. The adjacent roots of <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> are connected by extraradicular hyphae, thus forming arbuscular mycorrhizal networks (AMNS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Plants will face various survival problems in the growth and development stage, such as abiotic stresses, cold, and drought and biological stresses such as microorganisms, diseases, and pests, which affect the growth and reproduction of plants. Plants have evolved a series of signal transmission and defense mechanisms in response to different stresses. Studies have shown that salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) play important regulatory roles in plant biological stress responses. For example, when plants are fed by insects, a large amount of jasmonic acid (JA) will rapidly accumulate in the plant body, forming a conjugate JA ILE with isoleucine. JA IIE active molecules act on the JA pathway, promoting the receptor to combine with proteins to form a complex, and promoting the expression of downstream insect resistance-related genes to change in response to insect feeding and reduce damage to plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. SA usually participates in defense responses against pathogenic fungi, including PTI (PAMP-triggered immunity) pathway and ETI (effector triggered immunity) pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. At the same time, SA is an essential signal molecule for SAR (systemic acquired resistance). Plants can respond to SA signals and rapidly initiate immune defense after being stimulated by pathogenic fungi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Abscisic acid (ABA) can affect the transcriptional and post transcriptional modification of downstream regulators in the ABA signaling pathway, control plant responses to biological stress, and enhance plant resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This shows that hormones play an important role in plant signal transmission, but the signal transmission mechanism of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi under soil-borne disease stress is less studied at present.</p><p id="Par5">When plants are under stress, pathogenesis-related proteins (PR) in plants will be produced and accumulated. PR proteins form an important part of the plant defense system. Plant hormones and disease resistance signals have a certain effect on the expression of <italic>PR</italic> genes. In different plants, <italic>PR</italic> genes are induced by different hormones. For example, studies have shown that when exogenous hormone MeJA is applied to bamboo root ginger, the activity of PR protein in bamboo root ginger seedlings inoculated with pathogenic fungi Ralstonia solanacearum is rapidly enhanced, which improves the disease resistance of bamboo root ginger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>; when cassava was infected by whiteflies, various PR genes in the body showed different changes in response to whiteflies infection, and these <italic>PR</italic> genes were largely regulated by SA and JA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. After the infection of potato late blight and melon downy mildew on potato and melon, exogenous application of JA and SA can induce potato and melon to produce PR protein and other proteins, which is helpful for plants to improve disease resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. SnRK2 is only a protein kinase in plants. When ABA binds to the receptor protein to form a complex, SnRK2 protein kinase is activated and participates in the process of plant stress resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, the study of the <italic>SnRK2</italic> gene is of great significance for the study of ABA signal transduction in mycorrhizal symbiotic plants. In this experiment, plant endogenous hormones JA, SA, and ABA were used as detection hormones. The expression levels of the disease-related gene <italic>PR-10</italic> and the <italic>SnRK2</italic> gene in the differentially expressed genes annotated in the transcriptome data were studied under different conditions of inoculation with AM fungi and pathogenic fungi.</p><p id="Par6">In this experiment, the AM hyphal network was established among <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> plants.

It can be found that hormones play an important role in signal transmission.

The JA content of D-G1 infected by pathogenic fungi was higher than that of B-ST of <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> inoculated with AM fungi.

This may be because the stress occurs in the G1 root system, but not directly in the G2 root system.

When exogenous hormone MeJA was applied to cabbage, the JA content of the cabbage itself increased, while the ABA content decreased.

At present, most studies are aimed at abiotic stresses, such as drought stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Plants need water for growth. For their growth and development, plants have formed a mechanism to resist drought stress after long-term evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. We have little knowledge about the signaling mechanisms by which plants respond to abiotic stress, but in this experiment, we found that plants respond much faster to pathogenic fungi when containing mycorrhizal hyphal networks than we imagine.</p><p id="Par54">This research shows that plants and plant roots can form a huge mycorrhizal hyphal network through the hyphal bridge between the soil. When the plants on one side are given drought stress, the plants can sense the stress signal in advance, and then prepare for drought and drought resistance in advance, which is conducive to the plants' resistance to the adverse environment. Biological stress is mainly caused by various diseases, such as leaf spots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, blight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, etc. Fruitful research achievements have been made in model plants and important crops such as Arabidopsis, tobacco, rice, soybean, corn, etc., but the research on disease resistance signal transmission of medicinal plants is still relatively backward. This experiment to some extent compensates for this deficiency.</p><p id="Par55">After plants and AM fungi form symbionts, the cell structure in plant roots changes and is rich in abundant Arbuscular structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. It is the existence of Arbuscular structures that makes the communication between plants and fungi more favorable. Through hyphal connection, it can realize distant communication between plants. The mycorrhizal structure enables plants to transmit signals to adjacent roots faster when they encounter stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par56">This experiment confirmed that the inoculation of AM fungi can increase the content of JA, SA, and ABA in <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic>. JA and SA are important signal molecules in plants. The increase in hormone content can enhance the ability of plants to resist external stress. In the analysis of <italic>PR-10</italic> gene expression, it was found that <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic>, which formed a mycelial network between AM fungi and plant roots, could promote healthy roots to transmit disease resistance signals to recipient <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> through mycelial bridges when infected by pathogenic fungi. The <italic>SnRK2</italic> gene is down-regulated in mycorrhizal symbiotic plants. When the pathogenic fungi threaten the donor plants, it will also cause a series of corresponding changes in the receptor plant <italic>SnRK2</italic> gene: ABA accumulation inhibits the expression of <italic>SnRK2</italic>, and <italic>SnRK2</italic> is in the ABA transduction pathway. When <italic>SnRK2</italic> is inhibited, it weakens the ABA signal transduction in the root, resulting in ABA reducing the inhibition of root growth and other biological processes, which may be the response feedback of ABA hormone signal to AM fungi and pathogenic fungi.</p><p id="Par57"><italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> can transmit the signal of resistance to root rot through the jasmonic acid pathway; When plants suffer from disease stress, the content of JA increases significantly, and the increase of JA content will inhibit the content of SA in plants; The gene expression of <italic>PR-10</italic> gene in the roots of <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> with arbuscular mycorrhizal network infected by pathogenic fungi was 17.56 times higher than that inoculated only with pathogenic fungi; Changes in hormone content will also cause changes in the expression of related defense genes, such as <italic>SnRK2</italic> is inhibited by ABA in the signal transduction pathway, while JA and ABA show antagonistic changes after inoculation of pathogenic fungi in <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic>, so JA may positively regulate the expression of <italic>SnRK2</italic> gene.</p><p id="Par58">With the development of ecological agriculture, more and more local planting enterprises begin to pay attention to environmental protection and the good quality of products. In future agriculture, the use of AM fungi for biological prevention and control has a good industry prospect. Therefore, modern scientific and technological means should be used to promote the greening of agriculture and develop green agriculture in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
