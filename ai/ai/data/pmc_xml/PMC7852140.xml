Some of glycopeptide antibiotics have been approved for clinical use to treat persistent infections by Gram-positive multi-resistant pathogens since vancomycin was first approved in 1958 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Norvancomycin is an important glycopeptide antibiotic of vancomycin group, and has been used as a first-line empiric antibiotic therapy to prevent and treat the intracranial infections of MRSA (Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and MRSE (Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>) in China since 1969, although its structure was finally determined in the 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Norvancomycin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) has a closely similar chemical structure to vancomycin and shows a comparable antibacterial spectrum and activity to those of vancomycin. The fermentation potency of norvancomycin in the original strain <italic>Amycolatopsis orientalis</italic> CPCC 200066 was about 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml (unpublished data). After series of physical and chemical mutagenesis, a high yield norvancomycin strain (<italic>A. orientalis</italic> NCPC 2-48) was obtained from <italic>A. orientalis</italic> CPCC 200066 by North China Pharmaceutical Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Using the patented fermentation medium, the fermentation potency of high-yield strain could be increased up to more than 6000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml. Although <italic>A. orientalis</italic> NCPC 2&#x02013;48 has been successfully applied to industrial large-scale production, the potential high-yield mechanism and its biosynthetic regulatory mechanism remain obscure.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Norvancomycin&#x02019;s structure, biosynthetic gene cluster and genomic features of its producing strains. <bold>a</bold> Chemical structure of norvancomycin. <bold>b</bold> Organization of the <italic>nvcm</italic> BGC. <bold>c</bold> Comparison of genomic sequences of <italic>A. orientalis</italic> CPCC 200066 and NCPC 2-48.

More than forty genes were identified in the <italic>nvcm</italic> cluster (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), including four resistance proteins, three large NRPSs, several post-assembly tailoring enzymes, and a series of biosynthetic proteins for the supply of non-proteinaceous amino-acid precursors. Combining bioinformatics and biochemical studies, most biosynthetic steps of glycopeptide antibiotics are gradually deciphered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since chemical structure of norvancomycin is closely similar to vancomycin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), with only an <italic>N</italic>-methyl group absence at the N-terminus of the polypeptide, we speculate that the biosynthesis of norvancomycin also includes three steps by analogy with vancomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The regulatory mechanisms of glycopeptide antibiotics biosynthetic clusters are still not completely characterized. The VanR-VanS pair, a two-component regulatory system which controls the transcription of glycopeptide antibiotics resistance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], have been found in the A40926 cluster (Dbv6 and Dbv22) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], balhimycin cluster (VnlRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and teicoplanin cluster (Tei2 and Tei3, also named as Tcp7 and Tcp6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, the vancomycin and norvancomycin cluster lack VanRS although components of self-resistance system, <italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>vanHAXY</italic>, are present in the <italic>vcm</italic> and <italic>nvcm</italic> cluster. StrR-family regulators are most commonly present in glycopeptide antibiotics biosynthetic clusters as specific pathway regulators. Bbr in balhimycin cluster binds to five promoter regions within <italic>bal</italic> cluster in vitro, and these genes are responsible for dehydrovancosamine biosynthesis (<italic>dvaA</italic>), oxidative cross-link (<italic>oxyA</italic>), transportation (<italic>tba</italic>), sodium-proton antiporter (<italic>orf7</italic>) and self-regulation (<italic>bbr</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Likewise, Dbv4 and Tcp28 (also named as Tei15*) were proved to be positive regulators in the A40926 cluster and teicoplanin cluster, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, the proposed palindromic sequence (GTCCAaN<sub>17</sub>TtGGAC) for Bbr-homologous regulator-binding site is also conserved within <italic>bal</italic>, <italic>dbv</italic> and <italic>tcp</italic> BGCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, LuxR-family regulators have been characterized in A40926 and teicoplanin cluster. Dbv3 positively regulates production of A40926 and hierarchically control the transcription of <italic>dbv4</italic> (StrR-family) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, unlike StrR-family regulator, the direct target of LuxR-family regulator in the glycopeptide antibiotic clusters remain to be elucidated, since there is no direct binding evidence currently. The bioinformatic analysis indicates that there are four putative regulators (LuxR-family, StrR-family, TetR-family and AraC-family) present in or nearby the <italic>vcm</italic> or <italic>nvcm</italic> cluster. The regulatory mechanism of gene expression for the vancomycin or norvancomycin BGCs has not been reported yet.</p><p id="Par7">The purpose of this study is to uncover the high-yield and biosynthetic regulatory mechanism of industrial strain NCPC 2-48 through exploring the genomic and transcriptomic features compared with the original strain CPCC 200066. Here, we present comprehensive comparative genomics and transcriptomics analyses of these two strains and show that the whole biosynthetic gene cluster of norvancomycin, as well as some primary metabolite pathways for the amino acid and other precursors of norvancomycin were comprehensively upregulated. The cluster situated regulators, AoStrR1 and AoLuxR1, play a positive role in norvancomycin production, and almost all of the norvancomycin biosynthetic genes are directly controlled by AoStrR1. These results have provided insights into the mechanism of high yield production in the industrial strain, as well as the role of cluster-specific regulators in the norvancomycin biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Comparative genomics analysis of norvancomycin producing strains</title><p id="Par8">The complete genome of industrial producing strain <italic>A. orientalis</italic> NCPC 2-48 and that of original strain <italic>A. orientalis</italic> CPCC 200066 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] are both circular chromosomes of 9.5&#x000a0;Mb with a G+C content of 68.84% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). The genome analysis of industrial strain showed that it contained 8,705 genes, and the total length of genes was 8,579,274&#x000a0;bp, which makes up to 90.41% of genome. There are 404 tandem repeat sequence (35,253&#x000a0;bp), which makes up to 0.3715% of genome, 325 minisatellite DNAs, 11 microsatellite DNAs, 50 tRNAs, and 12 rRNAs.</p><p id="Par9">We compared the genomes of NCPC 2-48 to CPCC 200066 and found that two genomic sequences are extremely similar with a high identity of 99.97%. There was no large fragment duplication or deletion in the entire genome of NCPC 2-48 compared with CPCC 200066. Moreover, the internal structure of the chromosome and gene order were largely conserved without rearrangements appeared in the genome of NCPC 2-48. Both strains have extremely similar codon usage of 50 tRNA genes. For the norvancomycin biosynthesis, further comparative analysis of secondary metabolism gene clusters showed that no duplication, SVs (structural variations) or InDels (insertions and deletions of small fragments (&#x02264;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;bp)) were occurred in <italic>nvcm</italic> biosynthetic gene cluster in the industrial strain. It suggested that the high-yield of the industrial strain is not caused by the increased copy number of the <italic>nvcm</italic> biosynthetic gene cluster or gene mutations (SVs or InDels) within the cluster.</p><p id="Par10">The genomic difference between these two strains is mainly accounted for three SVs, including two deletions of 965&#x000a0;bp (SV1) and 12,212&#x000a0;bp (SV2) fragments and one insertion of 12,076&#x000a0;bp (SV3) fragment in strain NCPC 2-48 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). All these SVs appear at coding DNA sequence (CDS) regions but far away from the <italic>nvcm</italic> biosynthetic gene cluster. There are 34 protein coding genes involved in these fragments of deletion and insertion, including 3 regulators, 1 transporter, 3 transposases, 9 other enzymes and 18 unknown proteins (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). The coding gene information of the three SVs is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4.</p><p id="Par11">The first structural variation, SV1, occurred in gene B37_4355 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). The 965&#x000a0;bp of B37_4355 sequence is deleted in genome of NCPC 2-48. SV2 is a deleted fragment of 12,212&#x000a0;bp in genome of NCPC 2-48, corresponding to the original strain&#x02019;s chromosome position from gene B37_6566 to B37_6583. There are 17 possible CDSs in this region (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). The further analysis of the sequence flanking SV2 showed that one <italic>lacI</italic> family transcriptional regulatory gene is located upstream. Usually, <italic>lacI</italic> family regulators control the expression of some key enzymes involved in carbon metabolism, and regulate the transcription of a series of downstream genes including some transcriptional factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The deletion of genes downstream <italic>lacI</italic> might block the regulation of <italic>lacI</italic> and enhance glucose catabolism of primary metabolism, which is conducive to the precursor sugar synthesis of norvancomycin. SV3 is a 12,076&#x000a0;bp of insertion, which contains 16 possible CDSs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). Analysis of function of flanking genes revealed that there are some key enzymes of primary metabolism such as acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA synthetase at downstream of SV3.</p><p id="Par12">In addition to three fragments of deletion and insertion, there are also 216 InDels present in the genome of high-yield strain. The coding regions of some important enzymes related to primary and secondary metabolism together with transcription factors, such as LacI, LysR, TetR, MerR, YebC/PmpR, SARP family proteins and two-component regulators were present in these InDels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables. S5, S6). The InDels in these transcriptional factors may affect the expression of norvancomycin through some unknown regulatory mechanism. However, the function of these transcriptional factors remains unexplored. In these SVs and InDels, there are no functionally known genes directly related to the biosynthetic pathway of norvancomycin and its precursors based on their functional annotation. Thus, the genomic variations of industrial strain would be difficult to give a simple explanation on its high-yield production of norvancomycin. Since some key enzymes of primary metabolism were found in these SVs and InDels, or in flanking segments, we speculated that these genomic mutations may change the metabolic flow by affecting expression of the important enzymes of primary metabolism. Meanwhile, more than ten regulatory genes were detected in SVs and InDels. Along with the loss, insertion or mutation of these regulatory genes, the holistic regulation of primary or secondary metabolism and cell growth may be changed in the high-yield producer strain, which ultimately makes the overall metabolic flow more favorable for the biosynthesis of norvancomycin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Transcriptomics profiling at norvancomycin producing strains</title><p id="Par13">In order to further investigate the mechanism of high yield production of norvancomycin, the transcriptomic analysis of norvancomycin original strain and industrial strain were carried out at three different time points (12&#x000a0;h, 24&#x000a0;h and 48&#x000a0;h). RNA from NCPC 2-48 and CPCC 200066 were extracted and sequenced, and an average of 23,578,714 raw reads were generated. After removing low-quality reads, the average number of remaining clean reads was 23,523,435, and the average comparison rates of clean reads to the reference gene and reference genome were 80.54% and 96.69%, respectively. The statistics on the sequencing data for each sample is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7. Pair-wise differentially expressed gene (DEG) analyses revealed that more than 2000 DEGs, about one-fourth of the total genes in the genome, had significantly lower or higher transcript abundance (fold change (FC)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2 and false discovery rate (FDR)&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.001) at each time points (12&#x000a0;h, 24&#x000a0;h and 48&#x000a0;h) in NCPC 2&#x02013;48 relative to CPCC 200066, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a.

The results of DEGs hierarchical clustering analysis showed that differential gene expression pattern was similar at 24&#x000a0;h and 48&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), more than two-thirds of the differential genes were up-regulated in the industrial strain. Interestingly, more genes were downregulated at 12&#x000a0;h compared to other two time points (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), and there are 105 genes downregulated at 12&#x000a0;h but upregulated at 24&#x000a0;h and 48&#x000a0;h time points. KEGG pathway search showed that 35 out of these 105 genes are located in <italic>nvcm</italic> cluster. The biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites are usually activated in a growth phase-dependent manner, so that the genes responsible for secondary metabolism coincide with the onset of stationary phase in liquid fermentation in microorganisms. In the case of high-yield strain, transcriptional levels of genes responsible for biosynthesis of norvancomycin are lower in the early stage of growth (12&#x000a0;h), and then upregulated abruptly from 24 to 48&#x000a0;h, showing that the norvancomycin biosynthesis is more strictly controlled during the different growth stages. Due to the similarity of gene expression patterns between 24&#x000a0;h and 48&#x000a0;h, and most of DEGs included at 24&#x000a0;h (2,039 up-regulated and 628 down-regulated), we then analyzed the functional pathway enrichment of DEGs at 24&#x000a0;h based on KEGG database. Enrichment analysis of the functional categories of the transcriptome indicated that a total of 1,764 differential genes were annotated into 150 metabolic pathways, most of them related to the primary metabolism such as nitrogen metabolism and arginine biosynthesis, as well as the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as norvancomycin, tetracyclines and other type II polyketides, degradation of naphthalene and aromatic compounds, tyrosine and inositol phosphate metabolism processes.
