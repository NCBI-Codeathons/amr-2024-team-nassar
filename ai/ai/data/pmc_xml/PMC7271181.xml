In the Type I secretion system (T1SS, TOSS) there is a contiguous channel that traverses the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. There are only three protein subunits: the ABC protein, membrane fusion protein (MFP), and outer membrane protein (OMP). The Type I secretion system transports various molecules including ions, drugs and proteins of various sizes (20&#x02212;900&#x000a0;kDa). The Type II system (T2SS) in Gram-negative bacteria depends upon the Sec or Tat system for initial transport of proteins into the periplasm from where they pass through the outer membrane via a multimeric (12&#x02212;14 subunits) complex of pore forming secretin proteins. In addition to the secretin proteins, 10&#x02212;15 other inner and outer membrane proteins compose the full secretion apparatus, many with as yet unknown function. In some bacteria, certain proteins are shared between the pilus complex and the type II system. The Type III system (TTSS, T3SS) is essential for pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria, and allows them to translocate proteins into eukaryotic host cells. The type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) is a multisubunit membrane-spanning macromolecular assembly comprising more than 20 different protein, some of which have sequence homology with flagellar proteins. The TTSS encoded in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) is critical for adaptation to the intracellular environment within both phagocytic and epithelial cell types. The Type IV secretion system (T4SS, TFSS) is homologous to the conjugation machinery of bacteria and to archaeal flagella. It is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins.

<italic>addressins</italic> A family of cell adhesion molecules that have selective carbohydrate-binding capacity (selective lectins, hence the name).

The prefix letter is based on the site of their original identification, although they are not restricted to these locations. E-selectin (endothelial selectin, CD62E, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, ELAM-1, 610aa) is upregulated on endothelial cells of post-capillary venules where it is important for neutrophil margination during acute inflammation; it binds sialylated Lewis X and a particular glycoform of ESL-1 that is present on myeloid cells. L-selectin (leucocyte-endothelial cell adhesion molecule, LECAM, CD62L, LAM-1, MEL-14 antigen, leu-8, 372aa) is also involved in leucocyte-endothelial adhesion, for lymphocyte homing to <bold>high endothelial venules</bold> and for implantation of the embryo to the uterine wall. It binds to carbohydrates on CD34, CD162, GlyCam and MAdCAM. Once the leucocytes have migrated into tissue (diapedesis) the L-selectin is enzymatically removed by a membrane-associated metallopeptidase, a sheddase. P-selectin (platelet selectin CD62P, PADGEM, GMP-140, LECAM-3, 830aa) is rapidly upregulated in platelets and endothelial cells when activated, but only transiently expressed. It mediates rolling of neutrophils, platelets and some T-cell subsets to the endothelial lining of blood vessels.

SOCS1 (JAK-binding protein, JAB, STAT-induced STAT inhibitor-1, SSI-1, 211aa) is induced by IL6 and is probably the substrate recognition component of an ECS (Elongin BC-CUL2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins and seems to recognize JAK2. Other SOCs family members are induced by different cytokines and have slightly different targets (e.g. SOCS2, 198aa, is a negative regulator in the growth hormone/IGF1 signalling pathway).</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d2700">sodium channel</term><def><p id="p2705">
<bold>(1)</bold> Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV1.1, etc.) are responsible for electrical excitability of neurons. They are multi-subunit transmembrane channels with an aqueous pore around 0.4&#x000a0;nm diameter, with a negatively charged region internally (the &#x02018;selectivity filter&#x02019;) that blocks the passage of anions. The alpha subunits form the pore itself, the beta subunits vary between tissues and regulate the sensitivity. The channel opens in response to a small depolarization of the cell (usually caused by an approaching action potential), by a multistep process. Around 1000 sodium ions pass in the next millisecond, before the channel spontaneously closes (an event with single-step kinetics). The channel is then refractory to further depolarizations until returned to near the <bold>resting potential</bold>. There are around 100 channels per mm<sup>2</sup> in unmyelinated axons; in myelinated axons, they are concentrated at the <bold>nodes of Ranvier</bold>. Mutations are associated with various forms of <bold>epilepsy</bold>, muscular disorders (<bold>periodic paralysis</bold>, <bold>myotonia</bold>), <bold>long QT syndrome</bold>, <bold>Brugada&#x02019;s syndrome-1</bold>, <bold>erythromelalgia</bold>, <bold>congenital insensitivity to pain</bold> and <bold>paroxysmal extreme pain disorder</bold>. Many toxins (e.g. <bold>tetrodotoxin</bold>) affect the channel. <bold>(2)</bold> Amiloride-sensitive sodium channels are a family of nonvoltage-gated sodium-permeable ion channels inhibited by the diuretic drug, amiloride. They are well characterized in epithelia where they constitute the rate-limiting step for sodium ion reabsorption. They are heterotrimers of highly homologous alpha, beta and gamma subunits which also have homology with <bold>degenerins</bold> from <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Gain of function mutations in the beta or gamma subunits is the cause of <bold>Liddle&#x02019;s disease</bold>. A delta subunit that will assemble with the beta and gamma subunits to form a functional channel is also known.

Spondin 1 (F-spondin, vascular smooth muscle cell growth-promoting factor (VSGP), 624aa) is a secreted extracellular matrix protein that interacts with a central sequence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and prevents proteolytic processing by beta-secretase. Spondin 2 (M-spondin, mindin, 331aa) is a ligand for neutrophil and macrophage integrins and binding via mindin regulates the expression of Rho GTPases in dendritic cells. Mindin-deficient mice exhibit defective inflammatory and immune responses. The R-spondins regulate beta-<bold>catenin</bold> signalling. R-spondin 1 (RSPO1, 263aa) is expressed in enteroendocrine cells as well as in epithelial cells from various tissues. Mutations are associated with palmoplantar hyperkeratosis with squamous cell carcinoma of skin and sex reversal. R-spondin 2 (cristin 2, 243aa) apparently functions in a positive feedback loop to stimulate the WNT/beta-catenin cascade. RSPO3 (273aa) regulates kidney cell proliferation. RSPO4 and a RSPO4 splice variant induce epithelial proliferation in the gastrointestinal tract; mutations are associated with <bold>anonychia</bold> congenita.

If twisting is in the opposite direction to the turns of the double helix, i.e. anticlockwise, the DNA strands will either have to unwind or the whole structure will twist or supercoil - termed negative supercoiling. If twisting is in the same direction as the helix, clockwise, which winds the DNA up more tightly, positive supercoiling is generated. DNA that shows no supercoiling is said to be relaxed. Supercoiling in circular DNA can be detected by electrophoresis because supercoiled DNA migrates faster than relaxed DNA.
