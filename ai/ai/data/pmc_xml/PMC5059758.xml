The biocontrol <italic>Agrobacterium radiobacter</italic> K84 secretes the Trojan Horse antibiotic agrocin 84 that is selectively transported into the plant pathogen <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> and processed into the toxin TM84. We previously showed that TM84 employs a unique tRNA-dependent mechanism to inhibit leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), while the TM84-producer prevents self-poisoning by expressing a resistant LeuRS AgnB2. We now identify a mechanism by which the antibiotic-producing microbe resists its own toxin. Using a combination of structural, biochemical and biophysical approaches, we show that AgnB2 evolved structural changes so as to resist the antibiotic by eliminating the tRNA-dependence of TM84 binding. Mutagenesis of key resistance determinants results in mutants adopting an antibiotic-sensitive phenotype. This study illuminates the evolution of resistance in self-immunity genes and provides mechanistic insights into a fascinating tRNA-dependent antibiotic with applications for the development of anti-infectives and the prevention of biocontrol emasculation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

One mechanism of self-immunity is to encode resistant variants of the enzyme targeted by the antibiotic.

We recently identified the molecular target of TM84 in <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> as leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS<sub>At</sub>) which catalyses an essential first step in protein synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. To prevent cell suicide, <italic>A. radiobacter</italic> K84 contains a second, non-essential LeuRS, termed AgnB2, which is resistant to TM84 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The <italic>agnB2</italic> gene is encoded on the 44&#x02009;kb plasmid pAgK84, along with all the genes required to biosynthesize agrocin 84 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Importantly, horizontal gene transfer of the pAgK84 plasmid from <italic>A. radiobacter</italic> K84 to the pathogen has been previously reported to occur in the field, resulting in agrocin 84-resistant strains of <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> encoding the <italic>agnB2</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which AgnB2 provides immunity to agrocin 84 is crucial for combating antibiotic resistance.</p><p>The molecular target of TM84, LeuRS<sub>At</sub>, is an essential enzyme that specifically ligates leucine to its cognate tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> isoacceptors, a critical step before protein synthesis at the ribosome. The aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> is catalysed in a two-step mechanism in all LeuRSs: in the tRNA-independent first step, leucine is activated by ATP to form the essential obligate intermediate leucyl-adenylate (Leu-AMP) that is stably bound to the enzyme. In the second step, a bound tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> repositions its CCA 3&#x02032;-end into the LeuRS active site where activated-leucine is transferred to the tRNA. The essential catalytic nature of LeuRSs, and the 19 other canonical aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs), has led to these enzymes emerging as prominent targets for anti-pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, ranging in the prevention of fungal diseases in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> to bacterial plant pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. A substantial amount of work has been performed on stable analogues of aminoacyl-adenylates that bind tightly to an AARS active site, and preventing activation of the amino acid with ATP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. However, these molecules often cannot be transported efficiently into cells and can lack discrimination between microorganism and the intended host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>We recently showed that TM84 does not behave like other stable aminoacyl-adenylate analogues but, instead, employs a unique tRNA-dependent inhibition mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. TM84 binds only weakly to the LeuRS-active site on its own and requires the presence of tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> to form a tight binding ternary inhibition complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The X-ray crystal structure of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>&#x000b7;TM84 ternary complex shows TM84 bound in the Leu-AMP-binding site of the catalytic domain. The tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> is bound to LeuRS in an &#x02018;aminoacylation-like' conformation with the CCA 3&#x02032;-end of the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> entering into the active site with the terminal adenosine hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) directly with TM84 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). The positioning of the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> acceptor stem is accompanied with a substantial movement of the catalytic K<sup>619</sup>MSK<sup>622</sup>S motif. The K619 sidechain bonds to the penultimate tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> cytidine base, while K622 extends across the adenylate analogue and interacts with the phosphate of TM84 via a non-bridging oxygen. The repositioning of the Lys-Met-Ser-Lys-Ser (KMSKS) loop and tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> combine to effectively bury the bound TM84, thus explaining how the presence of tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> induces the tight binding of LeuRSs to TM84.</p><p>AgnB2 exhibits a high degree of resistance to TM84 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) despite the close similarity of TM84 to Leu-AMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and the need for AgnB2 to adopt a true aminoacylation complex as exhibited in a recent LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>&#x000b7;Leu-AMS crystal structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. These observations raise the question of how does AgnB2 achieve resistance to TM84 without dramatically interfering with the catalysis of the aminoacylation reaction. This is particularly intriguing as primary sequence alignments of AgnB2 and TM84-sensitive LeuRSs show a high similarity of residues, including catalytic motifs (except a single Q instead of M at the KMSKS motif). Here, we examine the TM84 resistance mechanisms employed by AgnB2 using both thermodynamics and steady-state enzyme kinetics. We also present the X-ray crystal structure of AgnB2 in complex with tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> and a stable leucyl-adenylate analogue and reveal tertiary interactions unique to AgnB2. We finally identify key TM84 immunity determinants in AgnB2 and the TM84-sensitive LeuRS<sub>At</sub> and show that it is possible to partially inter-convert the TM84 sensitivity properties of these enzymes.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Analysis of AgnB2 steady state enzyme kinetics</title><p>The ability of AgnB2 to discriminate between TM84 and the obligate reaction intermediate Leu-AMP prompted us to examine differences between the two molecules. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, TM84 contains a stable N-acyl phosphoamidate bond, instead of the reactive phosphoanhydride linkage in Leu-AMP. In addition, TM84 has a deoxy-arabinose sugar group, instead of a ribose with subsequent loss of a 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl (OH) and a repositioned 2&#x02032;-OH above the sugar ring, and replacement of the primary amine with another OH group. For TM84-sensitive LeuRSs, these subtle differences between toxin and reaction intermediate allow TM84 to employ a tRNA-dependent inhibition mechanism where the CCA 3&#x02032;-end of the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> binds in an &#x02018;aminoacylation-like conformation' into the active site of the enzyme and directly hydrogen bonds with the antibiotic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The &#x02018;aminoacylation-like' conformation of tRNA in the LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>&#x000b7;TM84 ternary inhibition complex exhibits a high degree of similarity with the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> in the true LeuRS aminoacylation conformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Since the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> bound to AgnB2 still has to reposition its CCA 3&#x02032;-end into the active site during catalysis of the aminoacyl transfer reaction, we questioned whether destabilization of the TM84 ternary complex in AgnB2 might be reflected in the kinetic properties of AgnB2.</p><p>Our steady-state kinetic analysis of AgnB2 examined both the overall aminoacylation reaction and the first step, the amino acid activation reaction, using the ATP/PPi exchange reaction. We firstly determined the apparent TM84 inhibition constant (<italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic>) for AgnB2 in the aminoacylation reaction by altering the ATP concentrations of the substrate and pre-incubating the AgnB2&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> complex before initiating the reaction. The data revealed an apparent <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> of 4.72&#x000b1;0.75&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We then determined the apparent TM84 <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> for AgnB2 by altering the leucine concentration and keeping the ATP fixed giving a value of 1.38&#x000b1;0.28&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Both values are more than three orders of magnitude weaker than the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>
<sup>app</sup> determined previously for the natural target LeuRS<sub>At</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Importantly, TM84 acted as a weak competitive inhibitor of AgnB2 with regards to both ATP and leucine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>, respectively) and therefore still binds to the synthetic active site and not at an alternative site. We also found that AgnB2 is resistant to TM84, but is still potently inhibited by Leu-AMS (a non-hydrolysable analogue of the Leu-AMP reaction intermediate), for both the amino acid activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) and overall aminoacylation reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Substantial weakening of the binding of the aminoacyl adenylate to AgnB2 did not evolve as a solution to generating resistance to TM84, as this would severely affect the catalysis of amino acid activation.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, AgnB2 and LeuRS<sub>At</sub> share similar <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values for all substrates. The higher <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> in AgnB2 may reflect an alteration in the interactions of AgnB2 with tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> that is relevant to resistance to the tRNA-dependent TM84 inhibitor. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for ATP is a small 3.8-fold higher affinity value for AgnB2 than for LeuRS<sub>At</sub>, while the leucine affinities show minimal differences. In the case of ATP/PPi exchange reaction, AgnB2 showed a higher <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for ATP compared with the aminoacylation reaction (10-fold increase). Interestingly, these kinetic comparisons represent only small energetic differences between the two enzymes, yet still lead to enzymes with pronounced differences in TM84 sensitivity. In addition, the steady-state kinetic properties shows that the ATP saturation plot for the overall aminoacylation reaction shows a degree of substrate inhibition, whereas the ATP/PPi exchange shows no substrate inhibition for ATP (data not shown) when tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> is absent. One possibility is the population of a second unproductive ATP-binding site in the AgnB2 active site that may in part explain the differences between the apparent TM84 <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic>'s determined for AgnB2 when varying leucine and ATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Interestingly, we do not observe any ATP substrate inhibition for LeuRS<sub>At</sub>. The data suggest that different substrate-dependent conformations populated by AgnB2 may be important for TM84 resistance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> has reduced effect on the affinity of TM84 to AgnB2</title><p>If resistance of AgnB2 is based on abolishing of the normal tRNA-dependent inhibition mechanism employed by TM84 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) then one would expect to see a decrease in the affinity for TM84, tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> and/or for TM84 in the presence of tRNA or vice versa. To test these possibilities, we used isothermal calorimetry (ITC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) to investigate the ligand binding modes to AgnB2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of 1052, nM for TM84 and 310&#x02009;nM for tRNA were obtained, indicating reductions in AgnB2-binding affinities for both TM84 (6.9-fold) and tRNA (3.7-fold), compared with LeuRS<sub>At</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Further examination of TM84 binding to AgnB2 (with pre-bound tRNA) showed a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 332&#x02009;nM, which suggests a substantial destabilization of the ternary complex (AgnB2&#x000b7;tRNA&#x000b7;TM84) (&#x0223c;330-fold decrease) as compared with the LeuRS<sub>At</sub>&#x000b7;tRNA&#x000b7;TM84 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, we also see no evidence of a binary isotherm for TM84 binding to AgnB2&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> species, unlike LeuRS<sub>At</sub>. Thus, AgnB2 has a significantly weakened affinity for TM84 as compared with LeuRS<sub>At</sub>. Since TM84 and the Leu-AMP analogue bind to the same active site but potentially to different conformations, we examined if AgnB2-binding affinity for Leu-AMS had been substantially weakened. Our results show that Leu-AMS binds to AgnB2 with low nanomolar binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>=4.4&#x02009;nM), which is slightly weaker than to LeuRS<sub>At</sub> (1.6&#x02009;nM). The fact that AgnB2 binds tightly to Leu-AMS is not so surprising since, firstly, AgnB2 has highly conserved residues at the synthetic site compared with other LeuRSs and, secondly, the enzyme must bind tightly to the Leu-AMP intermediate to catalyze the aminoacylation reaction. This result was supported by our enzyme kinetic observations above which showed that Leu-AMS is a low nanomolar inhibitor of both the AgnB2-catalyzed aminoacylation and amino acid activation reactions, demonstrating that the analogue efficiently competes with ATP and leucine substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Our thermodynamic results suggest that AgnB2 may achieve resistance to TM84 by not simply weakening the affinity for TM84 (and/or tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>) but most significantly by destabilizing the formation of the AgnB2&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>&#x000b7;TM84 complex. Interestingly, this is accomplished with only minimal change to affinity for the adenylate, allowing the enzyme to still efficiently carry out aminoacylation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Structure of AgnB2&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>&#x000b7;Leu-AMS ternary complex</title><p>To identify structural interactions in AgnB2 that may contribute to resistance, we performed extensive crystallizations trials with AgnB2, agrobacterium tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> and multiple combinations of substrates or inhibitors. We obtained an X-ray crystal structure of AgnB2 in complex with tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> and Leu-AMS; the final model was refined to a final R-factor of 19.4&#x00025; (R-free=23.8&#x00025;) and a final resolution of 2.1&#x02009;&#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>The overall AgnB2&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>&#x000b7;Leu-AMS structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, and see domain architecture in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) presents a similar conformation to a number of bacterial LeuRS structures obtained in complex with tRNAs<sup>Leu</sup>, in which the CCA 3&#x02032;-end is positioned into the editing active site and represents what appears to be the preferred LeuRS conformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. This editing conformation of the tRNA in the AgnB2 complex is in contrast to the structures of the TM84 ternary inhibition complex of LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>&#x000b7;TM84 and the LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>&#x000b7;Leu-AMS aminoacylation complex which have the CCA 3&#x02032;-end penetrating into the catalytic active site of the enzyme positioned next to the bound inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Another important interaction observed in the structure is the C-terminal domain interaction with the variable loop of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). A comparison of the aminoacylation and editing states in LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>, shows the C-term domain coupled to the variable arm of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> rotates significantly upwards towards the catalytic domain in the aminoacylation state. It has been hypothesized that this C-term domain movement propagates towards the main body of the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> and towards the acceptor stem, and together with rotations of other external domains, or residues, forces the 3&#x02032;-end of the tRNA into the catalytic site. Interestingly, the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> from <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> has a shorter variable stem than the <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA, therefore questioning whether this propagation force due to coupling of tRNA with the C-term domain is also required in AgnB2 for aminoacylation. In fact, a comparison of the C-terminal domain from AgnB2 compared with the <italic>E. coli</italic> editing structure (LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> shows there is a rotation of about 18.5&#x000b0; and the shorter variable loop of agrobacterium only makes one contact with the phosphate of nucleotide 46f (P46f) vs the <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA which makes multiple contacts with the variable domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). This structure may give new insights into the function of this stem-loop.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Unique amino acid substitutions in the AgnB2 catalytic site</title><p>Close inspection of the Leu-AMS-binding site in the AgnB2 structure reveals that the residues at the catalytic site are very similar compared with those found in LeuRS<sub><bold>Ec</bold></sub>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>. There are small differences including F39 in AgnB2, forming part of the hydrophobic pocket for the leucine, vs the corresponding L41 found in the LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>. Additionally, E528 in AgnB2 exhibits a different rotamer away from ribose hydroxyl vs the corresponding E532 residue in the LeuRS<sub><bold>Ec</bold></sub> aminoacylation complex, which is situated more closely to the ribose hydroxyl. The LeuRS<sub><bold>Ec</bold></sub> E532 plays an important role in catalysis of the aminoacylation reaction, as suggested by the LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>&#x000b7;Leu-AMS complex structure and confirmed by biochemical experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The observation that TM84-sensitive LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub> and resistant AgnB2 showed no substantial differences between active site residues directly interacting with Leu-AMS might explain how the two enzymes can bind equally well to Leu-AMS and carry out aminoacylation with close kinetic parameters (see above). It therefore follows that no AgnB2 residues are directly in a position to interrogate the 5&#x02032; N-acyl phosphoramidate bond of TM84 when it is bound to the enzyme alone. The weaker binding of TM84 to AgnB2, with or without tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>, compared with LeuRS<sub>At</sub> might be explained by residues or domains that do not directly interact with the adenylate analogue, but which could promote long range effects or conformational changes affecting the catalytic site or perturbing the interaction with tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>.</p><p>The KMSKS catalytic peptide motif, along with the HIGH loop, is present in all Class I aaRSs, including LeuRSs, and has been shown to play a critical role in the both the amino acid activation reaction and the aminoacyl transfer reactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Biochemical and biophysical studies on class I synthetases, including LeuRS, shows that ATP binding to the catalytic active site leads to a conformational change in the mobile KMSKS loop shifting it from an &#x02018;open' to a &#x02018;closed' conformation with the two lysine residues of the KMSKS loop interacting with the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; phosphates of the ATP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Once the aminoacyl-adenylate is formed, the KMSKS loop moves into a &#x02018;semi-open' conformation to allow for the entry of the CCA 3&#x02032;-end of the tRNA into the active site. Finally, once the CCA 3&#x02032;-end of the tRNA is in the active site, the KMSKS loop once again adopts the closed conformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In the case of AgnB2, the highly conserved methionine of the KMSKS motif is interestingly replaced by a glutamine residue (Q573). Our structure shows that Leu-AMS is bound in the active site with the mobile KQSKS loop present in a semi-open conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). This loop position is in contrast to the fully closed position exhibited by the KMSKS loop in the LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>&#x000b7;tRNA&#x000b7;TM84 ternary complex where the second lysine of the KMSKS loop (K622) directly interacts with the non-bridging phosphate of the nucleotide analogue and the first lysine of the KMSKS loop (K619) interacts with cytosine 75 of the tRNA 3&#x02032;-end<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.

The equivalent position in AgnB2, Q573, forms a hydrogen bond side-chain interaction with the side chain of T581 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), which is found to be a conserved hydrophobic residue in TM84 sensitive LeuRSs (I628 in LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). It is interesting to note that the AgnB2 KQSKS loop exhibits a distinctly shifted position relative to the Leu-AMP binding pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), perhaps due to these changes. The fact that a glutamine residue is found in this critical catalytic motif but not in any other LeuRS in nature, may indicate an important role for Q573 in TM84 resistance. It maybe that a substantial number of compensatory mutations are required to accommodate Q573 in AgnB2.</p><p>T42 and A102 are two other residues that are specific to AgnB2. T42 is positioned upstream from the catalytic H<sup>47</sup>IGH<sup>50</sup> motif, while the side chain of A102 is situated in close proximity to T42 on a neighbouring &#x003b1;-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Importantly, the presence of A102 in AgnB2, instead of an asparagine as found in the LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub> structure (N104), leads to loss of an H-bond interaction between the &#x003b1;-helix (96&#x02013;114) and a main-chain peptide bond located at T42 (P45 LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub>). Both these modifications could allow for subtle changes in the positioning of the neighbouring HIGH motif that binds TM84.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>AgnB2 has modified tRNA elements compared with LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub></title><p>A prominent feature of the AgnB2 structure is the lack of an idiosyncratic leucyl-specific insertion domain (LS-domain), which is present in bacterial LeuRS, except in a few cases such, as <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> or <italic>Mycoplasma mobile</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, and as seen in the <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> LeuRS (LeuRS<sub>Hp</sub>) primary amino acid sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>.

We introduced these mutations at corresponding positions (as determined by homology modelling) in the TM84-sensitive enzyme LeuRS<sub>At</sub> (P45T, N105A and M633Q) and tested whether these mutations imparted resistance using our <italic>in vivo</italic> assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The single M633Q mutation in the K(M/Q)SKS loop is restrictive in nature, as it was not tolerated in the LeuRS<sub>At</sub> enzyme, most likely resulting in a functionally inactive enzyme. In contrast, the P45T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>) or N105A (data not shown) are permissive mutations and had a small effect on enzyme function or TM84 sensitivity. A P45T/N105A double mutant showed no increase in resistance for LeuRS<sub>At</sub>. When the P45T was introduced with M633Q in a double mutant, the P45T acted as a permissive mutation, increasing the resistance of the mutant enzyme. Finally, when all three mutations were introduced into LeuRS<sub>At</sub> (P45T/N105A/M633Q, termed LeuRS<sub>At</sub> Triad) there was a significant increase in resistance to the antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>) compared with wild type (wt).</p><p>Kinetic inhibition experiments on LeuRS<sub>At</sub> Triad showed the enzyme was resistant to to concentrations of TM84 up to 500&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>).

During production of agrocin 84, the biocontrol <italic>A. radiobacter</italic> strain 84 expresses the self-immunity LeuRS AgnB2 to prevent cell suicide. Our data show that AgnB2 achieves resistance to TM84 by minimizing the effect tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> has on the toxin's affinity for the enzyme as well as weakening its affinity for tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> and the inhibitor alone. Remarkably, this resistance phenotype is achieved without dramatically affecting the catalysis of the overall aminoacylation reaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with this observation, the X-ray crystal structure of the AgnB2&#x000b7;tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>&#x000b7;Leu-AMS ternary complex reveals that residues in the synthetic active site that directly bind Leu-AMP are not substantially different from other bacterial LeuRSs.</p><p>We identified key molecular determinants imparting TM84 resistance (or sensitivity) to LeuRSs by utilizing an approach based on the analysis of structures of the naturally resistant and sensitive enzymes AgnB2 and LeuRS<sub>Ec</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). LeuRS mutants that affected TM84 sensitivity were then tested using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches. Our data indicate that the molecular elements in LeuRSs that contribute to TM84 sensitivity or resistance are much more complex than one would expect <italic>a priori</italic>. Surprisingly, some of these determinants were not located directly in the active site but on the periphery (with distances &#x0223c;10&#x02013;15&#x02009;&#x000c5; for most residues and 25&#x02009;&#x000c5; for Q413), including some residues interacting with the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>. The core resistance mutations in the catalytic domain of TM84 resistant AgnB2 are located in KQSKS loop (Q573), just upstream of the HIGH loop (T42) or buttressing next to T42 in the case of A102. It is possible that the nature of the amino acids at these particular sites in LeuRSs may affect the molecular dynamics of these two critical catalytic motifs and ultimately altering the LeuRSs TM84 sensitivity phenotype. The exact contribution of other determinants to TM84 sensitivity at a greater distance from the active site is more difficult to discern. For AgnB2, alterations in tRNA-binding contacts, due to lack of an LS domain, C-term domain modifications, and the effect of Q413 on CCA 3&#x02032;-end localization in the active site, may all play a role in destabilizing a TM84 ternary complex leading to resistance. It maybe that evolution has traversed a narrow energetic landscape towards a resistance phenotype by exploiting small energetic differences between mutants to produce larger scale changes in only certain kinetic and/or thermodynamic parameters. Presumably, there must be other additional unconserved residues that have played subtle compensatory roles on the pathway towards evolution of TM84 resistance.</p><p>Why did nature evolve TM84 to target LeuRS<sub>At</sub> and not another AARSs from <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>, and in particular the other Class I AARSs that have similar active site architectures such as IleRS and ValRS.

This analysis may provide some understanding of the LeuRS specificity of TM84. One possible reason that agrocin 84/TM84 evolved to target a LeuRS maybe because leucine is one of the most abundant amino acids in proteins, and so translation could be particularly sensitive to interference of LeuRS activity. A more plausible reason is that agrocin 84/TM84, or its evolutionary ancestor, had other roles in <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> biology that predisposed the toxin to evolve into a LeuRS inhibitor. The recent finding that the uptake molecule of agrocin 84, when cleaved from TM84, can act as signalling molecule binding to a key agrobacterial transcriptional regulator that controls quorum-sensing signal synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> provides some support for this latter view.</p><p>Horizontal gene transfer of the <italic>agnB2</italic> gene on the pAgK84 plasmid from <italic>A. radiobacter</italic> strain K84 to the pathogen threatens emasculation of the biocontrol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.

The pathogen takes up agrocinopine via an agrocinopine permease encoded on pTiC58. This transporter also recognizes the uptake moiety on agrocin 84, an antibiotic produced by the plant tumour biocontrol, <italic>A. radiobacter</italic> strain K84. Upon entry of agrocin 84 into the pathogen, it is cleaved into the toxic moiety TM84 and the transport moiety. TM84 targets the leucyl tRNA synthetase, thereby inhibiting the aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>. This subsequently leads to the cessation of protein synthesis in the pathogen and leads to cell death. TM84 however has no effect on the aminoacylation reaction of a self-immunity LeuRS called AgnB2 that is encoded by the pAgK84 plasmid in <italic>A. radiobacter</italic> K84.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms12928-f1"/></fig><fig id="f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>AgnB2 discriminates between a stable Leu-AMP analogue and TM84.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chemical structures of Leu-AMP and TM84 with differences highlighted in green.

Upon mutation of three critical residues, P45, M633 and N105, a TM84 resistant mutant (LeuRS<sub>At</sub> Triad) is obtained. AgnB2 on the other hand forms a weak ternary complex with tRNA and TM84, thereby explaining its high level of resistance towards TM84.
