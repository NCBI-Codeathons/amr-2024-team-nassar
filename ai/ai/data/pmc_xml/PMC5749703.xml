Because the toxoflavin had an antibacterial activity, a metagenomic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> clone capable of growing well in the presence of toxoflavin (30 &#x003bc;g/ml) was isolated and the first metagenome-derived toxoflavin-degrading enzyme, TxeA of 140 amino acid residues, was identified from the positive <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> clone. The conserved amino acids for metal-binding and extradiol dioxygenase activity, Glu-12, His-8 and Glu-130, were revealed by the sequence analysis of TxeA. The optimum conditions for toxoflavin degradation were evaluated with the TxeA purified in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Toxoflavin was totally degraded at an initial toxoflavin concentration of 100 &#x003bc;g/ml and at pH 5.0 in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, dithiothreitol and oxygen. The final degradation products of toxoflavin and methyltoxoflavin were fully identified by MS and NMR as triazines. Therefore, we suggested that the new metagenomic enzyme, TxeA, provided the clue to applying the new metagenomic enzyme to resistance development of crop plants to toxoflavin-mediated disease as well as to biocatalysis for Baeyer-Villiger type oxidation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Intelligent Synthetic Biology Center of Global Frontier Project under grant NRF&#x02013;2014M3A6A8065315 and the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology under grant KK-1507-C04.

Toxoflavin was first isolated from <italic>Pseudomonas cocovenenans</italic>, with bongkrekic acid as two toxins that caused food poisoning [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183893.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Toxoflavin is naturally synthesized by several bacteria such as <italic>Burkholderia glumae</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia plantarii</italic>, and <italic>Burkholderia gladioli</italic>. Toxoflavin was known to be one of the critical virulence factors in crop diseases such as bacterial panicle blight, also known as seedling rot or grain rot, which is caused by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glumae</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gladioli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183893.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Toxicity of bacterial toxoflavin as a major virulence factor has been assigned to its ability to function as an active electron carrier between NADH and oxygen. The action of toxoflavin bypasses the cellular cytochrome system and causes the generation of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of oxygen and light [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183893.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This may also explain why toxoflavin shows antibacterial, antifungal and herbicidal activities [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Infection of toxoflavin-producing bacteria, particularly seed-borne <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glumae</italic>, has led to severe losses in rice crops in the world [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183893.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183893.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Bacterial grain rot occurring at the flowering stage of rice under high degree of temperature and moisture caused a significant loss in the rice yield up to 34%. In the southern USA, outbreaks of bacterial grain rot in rice fields in Louisiana in 1995 and 1998 made the rice yield loss up to 40% [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Currently, there are few control methods available for bacterial panicle blight of rice. Oxolinic acid treatment to rice seed was highly effective for the control of rice disease, but <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glumae</italic> strains naturally resistant to oxolinic acid have already occurred [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although some varieties of rice exhibit partial resistance to bacterial panicle blight, no rice variety showing complete resistance to the disease is currently available [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183893.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>There has been growing interest both in interference with biosynthesis and in degradation of toxoflavin. An effective enzyme to degrade the toxin itself can be used to serve as an anti-virulence strategy in toxoflavin-mediated diseases of rice. Recently, <italic>Paenibacillus polymyxa</italic> strain JH2 that survived in the presence of toxoflavin was isolated from rice seed samples [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. From this strain, a toxoflavin-degrading enzyme (TflA) capable of degrading toxoflavin was identified. The TflA enzyme catalyzed the aromatic ring-opening reaction by incorporating two atoms of dioxygen in toxoflavin and required Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion and dithiothreitol, unlike other extradiol dioxygenases [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nowadays the metagenomic DNA library consisting of genomes from as-yet uncultured or uncultivable microorganisms plays an important role in the identification of new enzymes with unique properties [<xref rid="pone.0183893.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183893.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, we first attempted to discover a new toxoflavin-degrading enzyme from metagenome. A high-throughput screening process to detect the toxoflavin degradation activity from metagenome was successfully carried out. After expression of the metagenomic gene and purification of enzyme, toxoflavin degradation reaction by the metagenome-derived toxoflavin-degrading enzyme was further characterized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>High-throughput screening for toxoflavin-degrading activity from metagenomic DNA library</title><p>The metagenome libraries used to screen toxoflavin-degrading activity were from Korea National Research Resource Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.knrrc.or.kr/">http://www.knrrc.or.kr/</ext-link>).

After 20 h, the cells were harvested using a centrifuge at 4000 rpm and 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The cell pellet was washed twice with distilled water and homogenized in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0, 50 mM) using an ultrasonicator (Sonics and Materials, USA) followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was applied onto the column for the 6X histidine tag-based affinity chromatography. The unbound proteins were removed by 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole. The protein bound to the column was then eluted by 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 300 mM NaCl with 250 mM imidazole.

To determine the enzymatic thermostability, the residual activity was measured after TxeA was preincubated at different temperatures (15&#x02013;50&#x000b0;C) for 60 min.
