In light of the significant potency against cancer, the biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported from many different <italic>Streptomyces</italic> strains, and the biosynthetic pathway were proposed mainly based on the <italic>in vivo</italic> feeding experiment with isotope labeled putative intermediates. Herein we report another gene cluster from <italic>Streptomyces griseovariabilis</italic> subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov responsible for the biosynthesis of echinomycin (a member of quinomycin family, also named quinomycin A) and presented <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence to corroborate the previous hypothesis on QXC biosynthesis, showing that only with the assistance of a MbtH-like protein Qui5, did the didomain NRPS protein (Qui18) perform the loading of a L-tryptophan onto its own PCP domain. Particularly, it was found that Qui5 and Qui18 subunits form a functional tetramer through size exclusion chromatography. The subsequent hydroxylation on &#x003b2;-carbon of the loaded L-tryptophan proved <italic>in vitro</italic> to be completed by cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylase Qui15. Importantly, only the Qui18 loaded L-tryptophan can be hydroxylated by Qui15 and the enzyme was inactive on free L-tryptophan. Additionally, the chemically synthesized (2<italic>S</italic>,3<italic>S</italic>) &#x003b2;-hydroxytryptophan was detected to be converted by the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase Qui17 through LC-MS, which enriched our previous knowledge that tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase nearly exclusively acted on L-tryptophan and 6-fluoro-tryptophan.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation of China, the Ministry of Science and Technology (973 and 863 Programs), Shanghai Pujiang Program from the Shanghai Municipal Council of Science and Technology.

The two aromatic compounds are structural analogs, crucial for the anticancer potency of quinomycin, including echinomycin (quinomycin A), triostin, SW-163 and thiocoraline via the intercalation of their QXC (for echinomycin and triostin) or HQA (for SW-163 and thiocoraline) into DNA base pairs to form a sandwiching structure so that both DNA replication and transcription are inhibited, despite the difference in the insertion hotspot on DNA which are determined by the amino acid residues in the NRP backbones <xref rid="pone.0056772-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056772-Addess1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056772-Erba1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

In detail for the aromatic precursor biosynthesis, at first, with the help of an MbtH-like protein, L-tryptophan is loaded onto a NRPS protein which consists of both adenylation (A) and PCP (T) domain, the assistance of the MbtH-like protein in the activity of the NRPS protein in echinomycin and triostin A biosynthesis was proposed by Kenji Watanabe, yet unsubstantiated <xref rid="pone.0056772-Watanabe3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056772-Praseuth1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A domain activates L-tryptophan by adenylation and subsequently catalyzes the formation of a thioester bond between the carbonyl group of adenylated tryptophan and the thiol group of phosphopantetheine on PCP domain. The loaded tryptophan is hydroxylated at &#x003b2;-carbon by a cytochrome P450 superfamily member to produce (2<italic>S</italic>,3<italic>S</italic>) &#x003b2;-hydroxytryptophanyl-S-PCP. The hydroxylated tryptophan is then released by a type II thioesterase to present (2<italic>S</italic>,3<italic>S</italic>) &#x003b2;-hydroxytryptophan. The free hydroxytryptophan undergoes a oxidative indole-ring opening mediated by a member of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase superfamily to form (2<italic>S</italic>,3<italic>R</italic>) <italic>N</italic>-formyl-&#x003b2;-hydroxykynurenine, which is hydrolyzed by a hydrolase to yield (2<italic>S</italic>,3<italic>R</italic>) &#x003b2;-hydroxykynurenine. For the QXC pathway, the subsequent reaction is an oxidative rearrangement fulfilled by a FAD-dependent oxidoreductase, giving rise to <italic>N</italic>-(2&#x02032;-aminophenyl)-&#x003b2;-hydroxyaspartic acid, the intermediate was converted to <italic>N</italic>-(2&#x02032;-aminophenyl)-&#x003b2;-ketoaspartic acid by a dehydrogenase. The ensuing three steps of decarboxylation, cyclization and oxidative aromatization reaction occur spontaneously to produce the last aromatic precursor QXC <xref rid="pone.0056772-Koketsu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. For the HQA pathway, the amino group on the &#x003b1;-carbon of (2<italic>S</italic>,3<italic>R</italic>) &#x003b2;-hydroxykynurenine is converted by an aminotransferase to form a carbonyl group, which is linked to the amino group steming from the nitrogen atom of L-tryptophan, resulting in the formation of another six-membered ring neighboring the benzyl ring, finally, it is reduced to HQA <xref rid="pone.0056772-Mady1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0056772-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0056772.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structures of echinomycin, thiocoraline,triostin A, SW-163C, QXC and HQA.</title><p>QXC: quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid; HQA: 3-hydroxyquinaldic acid.

A PCR product of around 600 bp would be displayed by the positive sample, as expected.

The biosynthesis of NRP backbone was encompassed by two NRPS bi-modular proteins Qui7 and Qui6, homolog of TrsJ and TrsI. Qui7 was responsible for the incorporation of Ser and Ala, Qui6 for Cys and Val. After the incorporation of Ser by Qui7, the adenylated quinoxaline-2-carboxylic aromatic precursor was linked to its amino group by the first C domain of Qui7. Besides, both the two modules of Qui6 had <italic>N</italic>-methylation domain downstream of the corresponding T domains, that is why Cys and Val in the NRP backbone are methylated at their &#x003b1;-amino groups. The aromatic precursor-coupled NRP was set free from the last PCP of Qui6 (homolog of TrsI) by the downstream TE domain via cyclodimerization, connecting two identical oligopeptides head to tail in the form of macrolide with the hydroxyl group of Ser bound to &#x003b1;-carboxyl group of <italic>N</italic>-methyl Val of the other chain. Two thiol groups of <italic>N</italic>-methyl Cys in the macrolide were linked together by Qui11 (homolog of TrsC) to form a disulfide bond, which produced triostin. Qui8 (homolog of TrsK), a SAM-dependent methyl transferase could convert triostin A to echinomycin by methylation and spontaneous rearrangement, transforming disulfide bond into thioacetal bond <xref rid="pone.0056772-Watanabe3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056772-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), but in <italic>S. triostinicus</italic>, the fermentation product was detected to contain mainly triostin A and minor echinomycin, in contrast, <italic>S. griseovariabilis</italic> was detected to produce echinomycin without triostin A. The difference seemed not to be attributable to the activity of TrsK, since its high identity to Qui8. More plausibly, it might be caused by substitution of two &#x02018;AT&#x02019; pairs in the promoter of <italic>qui8</italic> with &#x02018;GC&#x02019; pairs in that of <italic>trsK</italic> thereby attenuating the promoter of <italic>trsK</italic> and undermining the production of TrsK, and the scarcity of TrsK would cause the accumulation of triostin A for converting a minority of triostin A.</p><p>One putative regulation gene <italic>qui4</italic> (homolog of <italic>trsG</italic>) was detected in the gene cluster and predicted to be DNA-binding response regulator.

Hence, how the self-resistance of echinomycin was realized remains unresolved.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Determination of Substrate Specificity of Qui18</title><p>Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that Qui18 was an A-PCP two-domain NRPS protein, yet the database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nrps.igs.umaryland.edu/nrps/2metdb/">http://nrps.igs.umaryland.edu/nrps/2metdb/</ext-link>) failed to provide a definite prediction on which amino acid the A domain of Qui18 would recognize and load. Although the existent hypothesis on echinomycin biosynthesis favored L-tryptophan as the substrate and postulated the assistance of MbtH-like protein in the loading process, there hasn&#x02019;t yet been powerful evidence to support it. Besides, the present papers reporting the type of reaction catalyzed by A-PCP two-domain NRPS protein in association with MbtH-like protein revealed the loading of tyrosine in the biosynthesis of novobiocin, clorobiocin, simocyclinone D8, pacidamycin and vancomycin <xref rid="pone.0056772-Lautru1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056772-Boll1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056772-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Also, MbtH-like protein was demonstrate to be not necessarily indispensable in some amino acid loading reaction catalyzed by NRPS protein <xref rid="pone.0056772-Felnagle1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore, we tried to clarify here what amino acid would be loaded by Qui18 and whether the MbtH-like protein Qui5 would be necessary for the loading reaction.</p><p>During the expression and purification of related proteins, we found that much more soluble Qui18 would be acquired by coexpression of both <italic>qui5</italic> and <italic>qui18</italic> than by the expressing <italic>qui18</italic> alone. SDS-PAGE showed a little higher amount of Qui18 in the 100-fold diluted coexpression sample than the undiluted solely expressed sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0056772.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Through coexpression, the two proteins Qui5 and Qui18 could be copurified through Ni column affinity chromatography, since both the two genes in pJTU5906 carried His<sub>6</sub> tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0056772.s002">Figure S2</xref>). It was noteworthy that the copurified product was concentrated with Millipore Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units 50 kD, meaning that proteins smaller than 50 kD would be lost through centrifugation. Although Qui5 was only about 10 kD, it could still be detected through both SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, which suggested that Qui5 might bind to Qui18, which is big enough for the retention by Millipore Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units whereby the tightly bound Qui5 could be reserved and detected together with Qui18. More direct evidence to show the binding of Qui5 to Qui18 was provided by size exclusion chromatography which showed a peak corresponding to the mass weight of around 160 kD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0056772.s003">Figure S3</xref>), and the SDS-PAGE analysis about the fraction showed the existence of Qui5 and Qui18 at about an equal amount (data not shown), hence it can be concluded that two subunits of Qui5 and two subunits of Qui18 form a hetero-tetramer. Before doing any enzymatic study on Qui18, we must mature it by phosphopantetheinylating its PCP domain, which was realized by coexpression with <italic>sfp</italic> gene (<italic>Bacillus subtills</italic> PPTase gene expressed from pSV20) during fermentation. Both theoretical computation and ESI-QTOF-MS indicated the molecular weight of apo and holo-Qui18 was respectively 64,496 and 64,836 Da, which was a +340 mass shift consistent with 4&#x02032;-phosphopantetheine (4&#x02032;-PP) cofactor covalently attached to the conserved Ser residue of apo-Qui18. The <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphopantetheinylation efficiency was so high that the protein sample purified from pSV20 containing strain gave a peak at 16.8 min, having an ion signal of m/z at 64,836 Da and the signal of m/z at 64,496 Da was utterly undetected by ESI-QTOF-MS (data not shown). The coexpression sample of <italic>qui5</italic> and <italic>qui18</italic> or <italic>qui5</italic>, <italic>qui18</italic> and <italic>sfp</italic> gave another peak at 13.3 min, having a corresponding ion signal of m/z at 10,094 Da which was assigned to Qui5, and not surprisingly, no signal of Sfp was detected since Sfp didn&#x02019;t carry a His<sub>6</sub> tag. Given that the coexpression of Qui5 and Qui18 and Sfp could produce Qui18 at much higher concentration and the copurification of Qui5, Qui18 and Sfp could also guarantee the existence of mature Qui18 and Qui5, presumably in a complex form, the coexpression product of the three genes was directly used for the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay. After incubation for 2 hours, the sample in which coexpression product of Qui5 and holo-Qui18 were used with L-tryptophan added in showed a mass shift of +186, giving an ion signal of m/z at 65,022 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056772-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), which was conclusively due to the formation of a thio-ester bond between the thio group of 4&#x02032;-PP and the carboxyl group of L-tryptophan and a concomitant removal of water molecule, despite the mass shift to 65,022 Da, the retention time nearly stayed the same at 16.8 min, since the loaded L-tryptophan residue was too small for the original mass weight 64,836 Da to have notable effect on the retention time of Qui18. In use of the coexpression product of Qui5 and holo-Qui18 as above, yet with D-tryptophan or L-phenylalanine tested, the ion signal stayed unchanged at 64,836 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056772-g004">Figure 4C and D</xref>), demonstrating no occurrence of any amino acid loading. When holo-Qui18 was used even with the substrate L-tryptophan, the signal remained at 64,836 Da, and the supplementation of Qui5 to the holo-Qui18 turned out to make no difference at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056772-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The rationale for the failing of the holo-Qui18 supplemented with Qui5 to loading L-tryptophan might be that the <italic>in vitro</italic> condition was not suitable for the interaction of Qui5 with Qui18 and hence Qui5 was not able to assist in the loading even if the coexistence of the two protein, but there was another possibility which could trace back to the earlier stage when Qui18 was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> that the Qui18 couldn&#x02019;t fold correctly without the help of Qui5, the explanation is mainly based on the phenomenon referred to above that much more soluble Qui18 could be derived from the coexpression strain containing pJTU5906 than from the strain containing pJTU5905 for the expression of <italic>qui18</italic> alone. It might be that Qui5 coexpression with Qui18 <italic>in vivo</italic> helped Qui18 fold correctly immediately after the translation of <italic>qui18</italic> and simultaneously Qui5 would bind to Qui18 tightly <italic>in vivo</italic>. In sum, Qui18 recognized L-tryptophan as its substrate and its function depended on the association with Qui5. The association may take place soon after the translation of Qui18.</p><fig id="pone-0056772-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0056772.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Q-TOF-MS analysis of the amino acid loading activity of Qui18.</title><p>(A) Holo-Qui18 was used as the enzyme, L-tryptophan was tested as substrate; (B) The same as (A) except Qui5 was supplemented (C) Coexpression of Qui5 and holo-Qui18 was used as the enzyme, D-tryptophan was tested as substrate; (D) The same as (C) except the tested substrate was L-phenylalanine; (E) The same as (C) except the tested substrate was L-tryptophan; (F) MS result of the peak I, II and III, which respectively correspond to holo-Qui18, L-tryptophan loaded holo-Qui18 and Qui5; (G) Illustration of the protein molecule corresponding to I, II and III.

The above reports have intrigued us to investigate whether the similar case would hold true for echinomycin biosynthetic pathway. Qui15 was a heme-dependent protein, presenting a brownish color and had a molecular weight of about 46 kD per subunit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0056772.s004">Figure S4</xref>). According to the previous knowledge about &#x003b2;-carbon hydroxylation of amino acids, the reaction could occur only if the putative substrate amino acid was loaded onto NRPS protein. Therefore, before the hydroxylation reaction, L-tryptophan loading reaction proceeded for 2 hours, and then all the necessary factors for hydroxylation were supplemented. To make a reference, the free L-tryptophan was also used as the substrate for Qui15 as a negative control. Two peaks I and II observed in the LC-MS result were assigned as L-tryptophan and its corresponding product &#x003b2;-hydroxytryptophan, emerging respectively at 37 min and 31.2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056772-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Peak I showed an ion of m/z 205.1, which corresponds to the protonated quasi-molecular ion of L-tryptophan, the fragmentation profile of which is the same as that observed for L-tryptophan standard sample. Peak II had a strong signal at m/z 221.1, which is consistent with the protonated quasi-molecular ion of &#x003b2;-hydroxytryptophan and has the same fragmentation profile as (2<italic>S</italic>,3<italic>S</italic>) &#x003b2;-hydroxytryptophan standard sample (data not shown). In the negative control with free L-tryptophan as the substrate, what was applied to the C<sub>18</sub> reverse column for LC-MS analysis was the supernatant produced by centrifugation after the addition of trifluoro-acetic acid (TFA), while for the other reaction samples, what was analyzed was the hydrolytic product by KOH from the thioester bond between the carbonyl group of the loaded amino acid and the sulfur atom of the 4&#x02032;-PP cofactor of Qui18. Therefore, the amount of L-tryptophan observed in the reaction sample reflects how much Qui18 loaded L-tryptophan was not converted by Qui15, while the negative control indicates how much L-tryptophan in all was added to the reaction system. Although, the apparent areas of all peak I were comparable, the factual area of the negative control was much higher than others. The gauge for the ordinate value in the negative control was different from all other samples in the experiment. The negative control showed only Peak I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056772-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), which validated the inability of Qui15 to hydroxylate free L-tryptophan. As expected, the sample with the loaded L-tryptophan as the substrate but containing no Qui15, ferredoxin or ferredoxin reductase also presented only Peak I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056772-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The sample with all the necessary proteins and the loaded substrate and incubation for 60 min after the addition of Qui15, both peaks were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056772-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), in comparison, the sample incubated for 120 min only showed peak II, meaning all the loaded L-tryptophan was converted to hydroxytryptophan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056772-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). To make a reference, (2<italic>S</italic>,3<italic>S</italic>) &#x003b2;-hydroxytryptophan standard sample was also tested with LC-MS, producing only one peak which was consistent with peak II displayed in the above two reaction samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056772-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Consequently, the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments of Qui15 validated the hydroxylation step of Qui18 loaded L-tryptophan catalyzed by Qui15. There is a closely interlocked relationship in terms of enzyme function that MbtH-like protein Qui5 is indispensable for the loading of L-tryptophan by A-PCP didomain NRPS protein Qui18 and only after the loading by Qui18, was cytochrome P450 dependent hydroxylase Qui15 able to utilize L-tryptophan.</p><fig id="pone-0056772-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0056772.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>LC-MS analysis of the hydroxylation activity of Qui15.</title><p>Before the hydroxylation reaction, all the samples were incubated with coexpression of Qui5 and holo-Qui18 for 2 hours to ensure the loading of L-tryptophan other than the negative control of (A).

The primary metabolic TDO might also convert &#x003b2;-hydroxytryptophan.

The yield at 60 min scrambled to nearly threefold of that at 30 min, but from 60 min to 90 min, the yield increased only a little with a large amount of substrate HT left. The large quantity of remnant HT might be due to the stepwise inactivation of Qui17 during 90 min. Qui17, the family member of TDO, depended on heme to realize electron transfer, and heme is readily oxidized from its ferrous active form to ferric inactive form, though ascorbic acid and methylene blue was added to prevent its oxidation.
