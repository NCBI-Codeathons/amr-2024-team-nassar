Microorganisms degrade lignocellulose to liberate sugars to meet metabolic demands. Using a metagenomic sequencing approach, we previously demonstrated that the microbiome of the North American porcupine (<italic>Erethizon dorsatum</italic>) is replete with genes that could encode lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. Here, we report the identification, synthesis and partial characterization of four novel genes from the porcupine microbiome encoding putative lignocellulose-degrading enzymes: &#x003b2;-glucosidase, &#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranosidase, &#x003b2;-xylosidase, and endo-1,4-&#x003b2;-xylanase. These genes were identified via conserved catalytic domains associated with cellulose- and hemicellulose-degradation. Phylogenetic trees were created for each of these putative enzymes to depict genetic relatedness to known enzymes. Candidate genes were synthesized and cloned into plasmid expression vectors for inducible protein expression and secretion. The putative &#x003b2;-glucosidase fusion protein was efficiently secreted but did not permit <italic>Escherichia coli (E</italic>. <italic>coli)</italic> to use cellobiose as a sole carbon source, nor did the affinity purified enzyme cleave <italic>p</italic>-Nitrophenyl &#x003b2;-D-glucopyranoside (<italic>p</italic>-NPG) substrate <italic>in vitro</italic> over a range of physiological pH levels (pH 5&#x02013;7). The putative hemicellulose-degrading &#x003b2;-xylosidase and &#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranosidase enzymes also lacked <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme activity, but the affinity purified endo-1,4-&#x003b2;-xylanase protein cleaved a 6-chloro-4-methylumbelliferyl xylobioside substrate in acidic and neutral conditions, with maximal activity at pH 7. At this optimal pH, <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> were determined to be 32.005 &#x000b1; 4.72 &#x003bc;M, 1.16x10<sup>-5</sup> &#x000b1; 3.55x10<sup>-7</sup> M/s, and 94.72 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Thus, our pipeline enabled successful identification and characterization of a novel hemicellulose-degrading enzyme from the porcupine microbiome. Progress towards the goal of introducing a complete lignocellulose-degradation pathway into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> will be accelerated by combining synthetic metagenomic approaches with functional metagenomic library screening, which can identify novel enzymes unrelated to those found in available databases.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007670</institution-id><institution>Dalhousie Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2794-3722</contrib-id><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>Craig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Springboard</institution></funding-source><award-id>Innovation Mobilization</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohde</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the Dalhousie Medical Research Foundation and the Springboard Innovation Mobilization Program.

Lignocellulose is made of three carbohydrate polymers; lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose, with lignin being the most abundant [<xref rid="pone.0209221.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Lignin polymers are covalently linked to the other structural polysaccharides, hindering the ability of carbohydrate acting enzymes (CAZymes) to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose [<xref rid="pone.0209221.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Current industrial extraction methods include subjecting lignocellulose to high temperatures, high pressures, and strong acids and bases to remove lignin and enable processing of hemicellulose and cellulose polysaccharides [<xref rid="pone.0209221.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209221.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

For this reason, we characterized the microbiome of the porcupine as an attractive source of enzymes for biomass conversion. Using metagenomic and 16S sequencing approaches with the KEGG database, the undergraduate 2016 Dalhousie international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) team determined that the porcupine microbiome is replete with genes that could encode proteins similar to known lignocellulose-degrading enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0209221.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This report provided strong genetic evidence for these enzymes but did not provide direct experimental evidence for enzyme activity. To address this knowledge gap, we, the 2017 Dalhousie iGEM team, created a synthetic metagenomic pipeline which allowed us to identify four candidate CAZyme genes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation; &#x003b2;-glucosidase, &#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranosidase, &#x003b2;-xylosidase and endo-1,4-&#x003b2;-xylanase. These putative enzymes were analyzed alongside their 22 closest homologs using phylogenetics to ensure that the catalytic domain was conserved. These genes were synthesized, cloned into expression vectors and affinity-purified; activity of purified enzymes was measured using matched substrates. Among these, we demonstrated that the microbial endo-1,4-&#x003b2;-xylanase could hydrolyse xylobioside linked to a fluorescent molecule at pH 7. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide functional characterization of a CAZyme from the porcupine microbiome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification and cloning of putative microbial enzymes via a synthetic metagenomic pipeline</title><p>We used a metagenomic sequencing pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) to identify four microbial genes from porcupine fecal samples predicted to encode putative cellulose- or hemicellulose-degrading enzymes; a &#x003b2;-glucosidase, an &#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranosidase, a &#x003b2;-xylosidase, and an endo-1,4-&#x003b2;-xylanase (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209221.g002">2A</xref>).

Our goal was to provide a platform to discover these cooperative enzymes from different microbes. Our pipeline allowed the discovery of putative cellulolytic enzymes from the entire microbiome, including unculturable species. We believe that enzyme discovery using our synthetic metagenomic pipeline will provide opportunities to reverse-engineer lignocellulose degradation pathways for industrial applications.</p><p>Our synthetic metagenomic pipeline is a powerful tool for discovery, but it infers functional relationships from homology to previously characterized sequences in a database. Thus, the pipeline will likely fail to identify greatly divergent proteins with desirable properties. It may also identify putative enzymes that appear to have conserved functional domains but lack the function predicted by homology. By contrast, functional metagenomic library screens rely on functional assays for gene discovery. Thus, functional metagenomics provides a convenient approach to new gene discovery that nicely complements sequence-based approaches, but with greater potential for discovery of truly novel genes that don&#x02019;t resemble those in existing databases. Recently, using functional metagenomics, Cheng, <italic>et</italic>. <italic>al</italic>. discovered three novel &#x003b2;-galactosidase enzymes, two of which had conserved domains, and one of which was part of a previously undiscovered enzyme family [<xref rid="pone.0209221.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
