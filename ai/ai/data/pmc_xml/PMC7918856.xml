Introduction</title><p>Secondary metabolites, also known as natural products, are complex and three-dimensionally oriented molecules that belong to diverse groups of organic compounds, which expand across the chemical space of known molecules [<xref rid="B1-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Notably, secondary metabolites are important sources of chemical diversity for drug discovery and development [<xref rid="B2-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Ecologically, secondary metabolites are involved in the adaptive processes of species, interacting effectively and specifically with their biological targets [<xref rid="B1-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Microorganisms, especially bacteria and fungi, are sources of a vast chemical diversity of metabolites, due to their constant interaction with widely colonized areas, which are competitive habitats under constant stress [<xref rid="B3-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To increase survival rates under these conditions, microorganisms adopt several strategies, such as the production of secondary metabolites to counteract physicochemical changes in the environment (e.g., pigments), as well as bioactive secondary metabolites to combat their competitors in their native habitat. Examples of such metabolites are penicillin and epoxyketone peptides. The first, produced by fungi of the genera <italic>Penicillium</italic>, is induced in the presence of a bacteria, combating these competitors by covalently inhibiting Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs), many of which are essential for bacterial cell-wall synthesis and stability [<xref rid="B4-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, are one of the main classes of antibacterial agents used by humanity. On the other hand, the epoxyketone peptides eponemycin [<xref rid="B5-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and epoxomicin [<xref rid="B6-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] are produced by actinomycete bacteria, selectively binding to the active sites of the proteasome, an important proteolytic protein complex of eukaryotic cells, essential for protein homeostasis [<xref rid="B7-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Along with their antifungal properties, proteasome inhibitors of bacterial origin have been crucial for inspiring the development of second (e.g., carfilzomib/Kyprolis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>&#x02014;derived from epoxomicin [<xref rid="B6-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) and third (e.g., salinosporamide A/Marizomib [<xref rid="B9-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) generation proteasome inhibitors, with wide anticancer applications [<xref rid="B10-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>However, finding and producing bioactive secondary metabolites under controlled artificial conditions is not an easy task. The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by bacteria is a well-regulated process, involving groups of genes often organized into biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within the bacterial genome. Each BGC can code for numerous biosynthetic enzymes, regulators and sometimes macromolecules that confer resistance to the final natural product [<xref rid="B11-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The regulation of BGC expression provides bacteria with a way to expend energy on secondary metabolite production only when it is essential for growth or ecological competition [<xref rid="B13-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. BGC expression might be regulated by a variety of molecular mechanisms, and thus BGC regulation represents a hurdle for obtaining natural products under laboratory conditions, as most of cultivable bacteria do not express their biosynthetic potential outside of their native environment [<xref rid="B14-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, the need to implement alternative and innovative methodologies to induce the expression of silent and/or poorly expressed BGCs to produce novel bioactive natural substances under controlled conditions is evident [<xref rid="B15-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Bacterial elicitation is a strategy being pursued by the natural product community [<xref rid="B14-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It has been shown that physical and chemical alterations of growth media may alter the transcription rate of certain genes and may result in the induction of BGC expression otherwise kept silent under laboratory culture conditions. These alterations can involve the composition of growth media or growth conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, oxygenation), co-cultivation with competitors, addition of precursors or the use of chemicals that act as specific or broad epigenetic elicitors [<xref rid="B17-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic evaluation of such methods and the correlation between the growth condition and the elicitation method, the secondary metabolites produced and biological relevance of the produced compounds, is absent from the literature.</p><p>Metabolic changes provoked by chemical elicitors can be monitored by hyphenated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), revealing how elicitors can globally modify the expression of bacterial natural products, even at trace levels. However, LC-MS/MS data processing and mining remain challenging due to the inherent properties of metabolite elution in the LC and its behavior in electrospray ionization (ESI). These challenges have been tackled by the scientific community, including our group, initially focusing on the subsequent experimental problems that can be handled by computational methods, using mathematical rules and the physicochemical logic behind the data. (i) LC provides the separation of stereoisomers, that may display very similar MS/MS spectra. The retention time of the MS/MS must be taken into account, thereby avoiding merging isomeric MS/MS spectral pairs during LC-MS/MS data processing. In addition, the peak area of elution related to a given single compound is important information for the relative quantification of compounds in the sample, and may also be annotated and used during LC-MS/MS data mining. (ii) Variations in ion formation by a given compound during ESI are often observed. For instance, the formation of adducts, dimers, multiple charges and in-source fragmentation are frequently observed leading to MS/MS data amplification (about 40&#x02013;80% of the collected MS/MS spectra [<xref rid="B18-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) and loss of information of the MS/MS spectra related to the original compound. If not treated correctly, dataset dereplication with MS/MS databases of known compounds is further compromised, since spectral identification can be misled by spectral similarities to ionization variants instead of to the real metabolite. In addition to proprietary and publicly available LC-MS/MS data processing and mining tools, many advances in LC-MS/MS data handling have been recently reported, such as TidyMS for data extraction [<xref rid="B19-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], mzAdan [<xref rid="B20-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and feature-based molecular networking [<xref rid="B21-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to account for ionization variants, and CANOPUS for systematic compound class annotation based on MS/MS data [<xref rid="B22-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While these works were being reported, we developed our own tool, the NP<sup>3</sup> MS workflow, for processing and mining of LC-MS/MS data obtained from unpurified natural product chemical libraries.</p><p>In this work, we report a pilot library&#x02014;the elicited pre-fractionated bacterial (EPfB) chemical library&#x02014;which was prepared using a new methodology to select chemical elicitors aiming to modulate deep-sea bacterial metabolism. The investigation of the chemical diversity of the EPfB library was performed by frontier cheminformatic methods using MS/MS spectra, compounds and networks derived from the NP<sup>3</sup> MS workflow data processing, assisted by the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) [<xref rid="B23-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and the Universal Natural Products Database (UNPD)&#x02014;In-Silico MS/MS DataBase (ISDB) [<xref rid="B24-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] databases for compound identification. The biological potential of the EPfB library was assessed by comparing the chemical space achieved by the library with that of drugs and natural products, and further by screening the library in four bioassays. We show that the EPfB library&#x02019;s components overlap with the chemical space of drugs. Furthermore, chemical elicitation promoted the production of rare or potentially novel natural products, and bioactivity was mainly detected in the elicited pre-fractionated samples. These findings corroborate the statement that chemical elicitation and natural product library pre-fractionation are key strategies that allow the exploration of unique bioactive bacterial secondary metabolites. This work further pinpoints strategies for constructing and mining chemically diverse bacterial natural product libraries for natural product-based drug discovery pipelines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-metabolites-11-00107"><title>2.

Therefore, optimal culture conditions were selected based on bacterial population density for each strain and the tested chemical elicitors. The tests were performed with eight reported chemical elicitors: procaine and sodium butyrate, known for their epigenetic action in bacteria by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferases [<xref rid="B25-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and histone deacetylase (HDAC) [<xref rid="B17-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], respectively; ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin sulfate, which are antibiotics and were selected aiming to mimic the presence of natural competitors; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a known elicitor of a variety of bacterial metabolites with effects at the transcriptional level [<xref rid="B14-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a metal chelator used with the intention to induce the production of bacterial siderophores or other metabolites. The effect of elicitor concentration was also evaluated, resulting in a total of 17 different elicited conditions tested for each strain (8 chemical elicitors tested in at least 2 concentrations, streptomycin sulfate being tested at 3 concentrations due to positive previous results in our group at the selected concentrations).</p><p>The preliminary tests were evaluated according to visible morphological changes caused by the elicitor addition to solid media in the presence of a bacterial film. The classification of these alterations was qualitative, performed by evaluating the morphology of colonies and classifying each elicitor according to the alterations it caused. Furthermore, each of the 19 bacterial strains was evaluated at three different population densities (2, 17 and 24 h of preculture, optic densities at 600 nm varying from OD600 0.2 to OD600 5.0 a.u.), accounting for 969 tested cultivation conditions (19 strains, 17 elicited conditions and 3 pre-culture densities). For a better presentation of the results, the data were plotted in a matrix representing the observed morphological changes in different colors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In this matrix, it is clear that some bacterial strains (rows) presented high susceptibility to morphological changes with different chemical elicitors and concentrations (columns). The antibiotics chloramphenicol and ampicillin were lethal for most bacterial strains at the highest concentration. However, at sublethal concentrations, resistance (e.g., LAMA610, LAMA639, B001_701, B003_789) or changes in colony morphology (e.g., LAMA627, LAMA637) were observed, potentially indicating the modulation of bacterial metabolism. Some strains, such as LAMA627, LAMA639, B003_789 and LAMA915, were highly susceptible to the tested elicitors, presenting morphological changes in almost all the tests performed. The population density also influenced the morphological changes, as can be observed for the strain LAMA915, that showed distinct responses to different elicitors depending on the populational density, more significantly at the highest densities (17 h and 24 h of pre-cultures).</p><p>The tests on solid media were designed to be an easy and low-cost method for initial investigation of the culture condition, elicitor effect on bacterial response and, possibly, on secondary metabolite production. Once validated, this test can be easily implemented, guiding the selection of bacterial strains and elicitation conditions for preparing bacterial natural product libraries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot3-metabolites-11-00107"><title>2.1.3.

The elicited conditions contributed to 45% (514/1137) of these metabolites, which were exclusively detected in samples from bacterial cultures grown in the presence of the chemical elicitors and would not be observed under typical growth conditions. At the same time, 24% (271/1137) of the bacterial metabolites were only found in the control exclusive conditions, being thus downregulated in the presence of chemical elicitors. Finally, about 31% (352/1137) of the metabolites were detected in both control and elicited samples of the EPfB library, thus not being influenced by chemical elicitors.</p><p>EDTA and ampicillin were used for eliciting 5 and 3 strains respectively, being the chemical elicitors that most contributed to the total number of elicited metabolites, each representing an average of 50 new metabolites per strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). Kanamycin, procaine and sodium butyrate were used in individual strains, further adding elicited metabolites to the collection. Sodium butyrate contributed with the highest number of metabolites per strain, eliciting 82 and adding 53 new compounds to the elicited group.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the impact of crude extract fractionation on the detection of bacterial metabolites by LC-MS/MS. Most of the detected compounds were found exclusively in fractions (1047/1137&#x02014;92%), being those missed in the crude extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). On the other hand, very few (<italic>n</italic> = 6) compounds were missed by fractionating the crude extracts. In addition, a comparative analysis of crude extracts and fractions revealed that potentially novel compounds (669/713&#x02014;94%) were exclusively found in the fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). Furthermore, ~97% of the compounds were detected exclusively in the elicited (497/514) or control groups (265/271), and 81% (285/352) of the common compounds (found in both, control and elicited growth conditions) were only found in the fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f003">Figure 3</xref>d). Metabolites detected exclusively in the fractionated samples probably represent minor or low ionization energy molecules, for which the detection could be suppressed during LC-MS/MS data acquisition from highly complex samples, such as crude extracts. These minor compounds were evidenced in the enriched fractions and were modulated by chemical elicitation, as they were mostly found in the elicited or control exclusive fractions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-metabolites-11-00107"><title>2.2.2.

From the 1137 spectra related to bacterial metabolites, 424 (37%) matched with MS/MS spectra of known natural products.

The molecular network is organized into clusters of similar spectra, each cluster representing chemically and structurally related compounds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f004">Figure 4</xref>a is organized by cluster size, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f004">Figure 4</xref>b is organized according to the origin of the sample (elicited, control or both).</p><p>The analysis of the SSMN highlights the contribution of elicitation of bacterial cultures to the chemical diversity of the EPfB library. About 23% of the spectra clusters are composed only of nodes from elicited growth conditions (25/109 of the accounted clusters), potentially introducing new families of natural products (unique clusters) to the collection. Furthermore, elicited exclusive nodes are well distributed across the SSMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f004">Figure 4</xref>, in blue), covering 67% (73/109) of the spectra clusters, possibly contributing to chemical diversity around a given chemical scaffold. In combination with the common nodes (spectra found in both control and elicited conditions), the elicited samples cover about 94% (102/109) of the cluster found in the SSMN.</p><p>It is worth noting that there were clusters exclusively detected in the control conditions (without addition of any chemical elicitor), probably indicating that chemical elicitation also inhibited the production of some classes of bacterial metabolites, which were only detected in the control cultures. Seven small clusters (6% of total clusters) are composed only of nodes from non-elicited samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f004">Figure 4</xref>, in white).</p><p>Interestingly, a large cluster of possible biotransformation products of ampicillin was also found, composed of 16 nodes (large cluster colored blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Three bacterial strains were cultivated in the presence of ampicillin: LAMA915, LAMA585 and LAMA627; however, the biotransformation products were mainly found in LAMA915, which is a bacterial strain rich in beta-lactamases (GenBank assembly accession: GCA_001235865.1).</p><p>Four spectra clusters from the SSMN presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f004">Figure 4</xref> were extracted to exemplify clusters of bioactive and rare natural products present in the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Despite the identification given by the MS/MS databases used for comparisons, the data were also manually curated. This was done because some factors, such as coherence with the reported origin of the compounds (marine environment or bacterial natural products) and featured isotope occurrence (in case of halogens, for example) are not taken into account by the NP<sup>3</sup> MS workflow at this point&#x02014;or by any other MS/MS dereplication tool that we are aware of&#x02014;when handling spectra identification. This may lead to erroneous spectra identification, or to difficulties in selecting the right compound from a list of possible identification candidates of a given MS/MS consensus spectrum.</p><p>From the selected clusters with identified compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f005">Figure 5</xref>), JBIR-35 (1, <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 467) [<xref rid="B26-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], an indole-containing peptide, and tryptoquivaline K (2, <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 457) [<xref rid="B27-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], a quinazoline-containing indole alkaloid, were identified in a cluster from kanamycin-elicited samples of LAMA639 (Proteobacteria) culture.

The analysis of selected clusters and identified compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f005">Figure 5</xref>) point to the relevant biological activity of these known natural products. We then questioned whether the global diversity of natural compounds obtained in this work might also hold biological significance, especially in the context of drug discovery. For this, we first used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on molecular descriptors, using the 424 consensus spectra pointed as [M + H]<sup>+</sup> ions in our dataset that were identified by the GNPS (<italic>n</italic> = 12) and UNPD (<italic>n</italic> = 412) databases. We further used 208,009 natural products available in the UNPD-ISDB and 2078 approved drugs present in the DrugBank (<uri xlink:href="https://www.drugbank.ca">https://www.drugbank.ca</uri> (accessed on 25 April 2019)) [<xref rid="B38-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] as references for the chemical space of natural products and drugs, respectively. The molecular descriptors of each compound were calculated using CDK<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> v2.0 package (<uri xlink:href="https://cdk.github.io/">https://cdk.github.io/</uri> (accessed on 25 April 2019)) [<xref rid="B39-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], including three groups: topological (<italic>n</italic> = 195), constitutional (<italic>n</italic> = 17) and geometric (<italic>n</italic> = 49). Only uncorrelated descriptors were considered to perform the analyses, resulting in the following 18 selected variables: ALogp2, C1SP2, C1SP3, C3SP2, C3SP3, LipinskiFailures, MDEC.22, MDEC.33, MDEN.12, MDEN.22, MDEN.23, MDEO.22, nAcid, nBase, nRingBlocks, nRings7, WTPT.5 and XLogP.

Importantly, ~20% of the natural products lie in quadrant Q2, where the descriptor &#x0201c;Lipinski Failures&#x0201d; is pointed, showing unwanted molecular features for orally administered drugs. Q2 is also represented by molecular descriptors, usually describing compounds rich in saturated carbons, such as C1SP3 and nRingBlocks (e.g., terpenes), and/or rich in oxygen and unsaturated carbons, such as MDEO.22 and C1SP2 (e.g., flavonoids and tannins). These classes of natural products are more often found in plants.</p><p>The EPfB library is almost devoid of compounds in Q2 and rather evidences compounds at Q3 and Q4 mainly, in a distribution across the chemical space that overlaps the distribution of the approved drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,c). Q3 is represented by molecular descriptors related to nitrogen atoms (MDEN.12, MDEN.22, MDEN.23 and WTPT.5) and charged compounds (nBase and nAcid). Small peptides are expected to be found at Q3.

These cyclic peptides and alkaloids were found in all growth conditions. Cyclic peptides 6 and 9 were derived from B002_754 and B003_789 elicited by EDTA. These spectra were grouped into different clusters of the SSMN, with 6 in a cluster with 10 other nodes from the control and elicited conditions and 9 a sole spectrum in the SSMN. Compound 7 was identified from a [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectrum only observed by B002_754 cultivation in the absence of chemical elicitors (control conditions), with one similar consensus spectrum added to this SSMN cluster in the EDTA condition. Compound 8, an analogue of 7, and similar [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra, were found in an independent cluster of the SSMN, being composed by nodes from LAMA585 (Firmicutes) and LAMA627 (Proteobacteria), in both control and elicited growth conditions.</p><p>The contribution of minor metabolites to the expansion of the chemical space (fraction exclusive&#x02014;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f007">Figure 7</xref>b, left panels) should also be noted. Furthermore, similar compounds (non-identified, however similar to identified spectra in the SSMN) expanded the diversity around a given chemical scaffold, especially in the Q3 and Q4 regions of the chemical space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f007">Figure 7</xref>b, represented by circles). Compound series at Q3 and Q4 seem to be upregulated by chemical elicitors, since most of the series were only detected in the elicited conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f007">Figure 7</xref>b, in blue). A cluster of LAMA915 elicited by ampicillin and EDTA showed one [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectrum with spectra similarities to compound 10, related to daphnicyclidin alkaloids isolated from the bark of <italic>Daphniphyllum macropodum</italic> [<xref rid="B45-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This compound landmarks the chemical space of elicited minor compounds at the frontier of the Q3 and Q4 quadrants of the PCA. Ulongamide D (12) [<xref rid="B46-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], a beta-aminoacid containing cyclodepsipeptides isolated from cyanobacteria, further expanded the chemical space of this set of samples to the left side of Q3, by showing spectra similarities with [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra found only in the elicited enriched fractions of B003_789.</p><p>In the control condition of B003_789, a small cluster represented by hyrtiazepine (11) is found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f007">Figure 7</xref>b, in white), an indole alkaloid first isolated from a marine sponge with enzyme inhibition properties [<xref rid="B19-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B47-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The expression of these compounds was inhibited by EDTA elicitation. Finally, cystodytin C (13) [<xref rid="B49-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], an alkaloid first isolated from tunicates, showed spectra matches with one [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectrum present in the bioactive fractions of LAMA915. This node is linked to a non-identified spectrum, being produced in both control and elicited growth conditions.</p><p>The production of known natural products as major compounds (found in both &#x0201c;extract and fraction column&#x0201d;&#x02014;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f007">Figure 7</xref>b, right panels) was less affected by chemical elicitation. Only four identified major compounds were found in the elicited exclusive condition. These include the biotransformation products of ampicillin mentioned before (larger circle), the major compound of the elicited exclusive SSMN cluster from which compounds 1&#x02013;2 were derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f005">Figure 5</xref>), and spectra matches to plant alkaloids (Q3) and hydrophobic diterpenes (Q1).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-metabolites-11-00107"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Natural product libraries obtained from bacteria, fungi or plant are central for drug discovery [<xref rid="B50-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Considering that secondary metabolites can be tightly regulated, laboratory culture conditions can be challenging to induce the expression of all or almost all metabolites encoded by the genome of bacteria or fungi, in order to obtain a representative library. There are numerous possibilities to be explored in culture conditions to mimic the natural environment, including pH, temperature, time of incubation, media composition and chemical elicitors [<xref rid="B17-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The latter were explored in the present study, being systematically investigated by new methods of library preparation and analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>To obtain the EPfB chemical library presented in this work, a preliminary screening on agar plates was first established to select the most suitable chemical elicitor that would induce changes in colony morphology or populational variants, potentially mimicking the natural habitat and competitors of bacteria under laboratory conditions. Results obtained and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f002">Figure 2</xref> demonstrated how each strain growth was modulated by a specific elicitor. From this test, the most promising chemical elicitors were selected for large scale cultivation in liquid media aiming to induce the expression and to extract cryptic secondary metabolites. As shown, the chosen elicitors did in fact expand the chemical space of the library and gave access to a reservoir of small molecules that could not have been produced under normal culture conditions (please see also the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00107">Supplementary Materials</xref> for an analysis of chemical elicitors per bacterial strain). Bacterial cultivation on agar plates is a low-cost and accessible approach for screening multiple chemical elicitors in the process of preparing bacterial natural product libraries and should be used as a guide in selecting chemical elicitors for large-scale growth.</p><p>Bacterial crude extracts were obtained and fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography to construct the library, as enriched fractions are more suitable to perform high throughput biological screenings [<xref rid="B51-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and LC-MS/MS data collection [<xref rid="B23-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Indeed, fractionation of the crude extracts evidenced about 90% of the bacterial metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f003">Figure 3</xref>c) and the biological activity (<xref rid="metabolites-11-00107-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) detected from the samples comprising the EPfB chemical library.</p><p>The NP<sup>3</sup> MS workflow was applied to extract the [M + H]<sup>+</sup> MS/MS consensus spectra relative to bacterial metabolites, retaining the information of the sample of origin, its biological activity and chromatographic information. Finally, the GNPS and UNPD-ISDB databases were used to identify the [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra and the NP<sup>3</sup> MS workflow selected the top results based on theMS/MS spectra matching scores. Improvements in MS/MS data mining tools are being pursued in the current literature [<xref rid="B21-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B47-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although none of them are currently perfect at retrieving the correct [M + H]<sup>+</sup> ions or the correct identification of compounds from MS/MS spectra databases, untargeted metabolomics have increasingly proven to be a valuable asset for mining compound collections and comparing of biological groups.</p><p>The [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra retrieved from the EPfB library by the NP<sup>3</sup> MS workflow were counted in each bacterial group, revealing that the elicitation of bacterial cultures had almost doubled (~45%) the number of compounds detected in the data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). Analysis of the library&#x02019;s [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra in comparison with databases revealed that most (63%) of these spectra were new to the MS/MS public collections accessed, half of them (49%) being only observed in the elicited growth conditions. Compound novelty was expected from the deep-sea bacteria collection used for the construction of the EPfB library. However, the use of the chemical elicitors further increased the number and the novelty of the metabolites produced ex situ, further highlighting the importance of chemical elicitation of bacterial cultures when prospecting novel bacterial natural products.</p><p>The SSMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f004">Figure 4</xref>) was constructed using the [M + H]<sup>+</sup> MS/MS consensus spectra, giving a global visualization of the compound diversity introduced by chemical elicitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Clusters of compounds linked to bacterial metabolites were detected under specific growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). SSMNs have been extensively used in the last few years by the natural products community [<xref rid="B23-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and indeed represent a powerful tool to overview the chemical diversity contained, and to dereplicate unpurified natural product chemical samples. Groups of related compounds could be detected under specific growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f005">Figure 5</xref>), highlighting rare bioactive compounds, such as tryptoquivaline K, the polyketide K-3, the macrolactam verticilactam and triterpenoid derivatives. Small clusters of non-identified spectra were also observed, potentially representing new series of compounds introduced by deep-sea bacteria and chemical elicitation, which might drive the discovery of novel natural products for drug development and chemical ecology.</p><p>Finally, the chemical space occupied by compounds identified from the EPfB library were compared to the natural products (UNPD-ISDB) and to the drug (Drug Bank, approved drugs) chemical spaces. The identified compounds cover the chemical space of drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, bacterial metabolites were shown to avoid the Lipinski&#x02019;s failures region (Q2), which is partially occupied by known natural products. The bacterial collection further concentrated nitrogenated compounds (Q3), which are important molecular features of drugs. Overall, the compounds identified in the EPfB library span the chemical space of approved drugs, bringing chemical diversity in the relevant biological space. What is worth noticing is that the bioactive fractions derived from the biological screenings reported here concentrate compounds at Q3 and Q4, highlighting the importance of these regions of the chemical space also for in vitro bioactivity.</p><p>However, the abovementioned analyses were carried out with less than 40% of the bacterial metabolites identified from the EPfB library as MS/MS spectra database matches, from which chemical descriptors could be extracted. Part of the remaining [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra in our collection could be linked to at least one identified compound, covering 65% (71/109) of the SSMN clusters, further landmarking the chemical space covered by the EPfB library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f007">Figure 7</xref>a). Non-identified analogues were concentrated at Q3 and Q4, most of the series minor compounds being modulated by chemical elicitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f007">Figure 7</xref>b).</p><p>The analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f007">Figure 7</xref> complemented well the SSMN evaluation, grouping the identified compounds and their potential analogues by chemical descriptors, independent of their spectra similarities. This assisted the characterization of the chemical space covered by the EPfB library. In particular, Q3&#x02014;a diverse and relevant chemical space of drugs&#x02014;shows nitrogen-rich compounds of moderate molecular complexity, derived from spectra matches from fractions of different bacteria, especially in the elicited and control exclusive growth conditions. Since this region concentrates small modified peptides, it is possible that NRPS and mixed NRPS biosynthetic pathways are directly affected by chemical elicitors.</p><p>The additional analyses of the EPfB library per strain, detailed in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00107">Supplementary Materials</xref>, further revealed that all the chemical elicitors used modulated the production of metabolites in all bacterial strains. The effect of a given chemical elicitor appeared to be strain dependent, it being the contribution of metabolites induced by the chemical elicitor variable according to the bacterial strain. The bacterial strains further responded differently to the distinct chemical elicitors used, with a particular chemical elicitor being more effective in introducing non-redundant and novel metabolites by a given strain. Therefore, testing and selecting more than one chemical elicitor for a given bacterial strain growth under laboratory conditions is important towards the production of the maximum number of metabolites possible for a particular strain.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-metabolites-11-00107"><title>4.

For each time point, 100 &#x000b5;L were aliquoted for measurement of OD<sub>600</sub> measurement; 1 mL from each preculture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min and the pellet was resuspend in 100 &#x000b5;L of supernatant, plated onto selected solid media and incubated at 28 &#x000b0;C, for 16 h. Then, 5 &#x000b5;L drops of the chemical elicitors were directly applied on each culture using an automated pipette (Eppendorf Xplorer 8 channels). For this, stock solutions of each chemical elicitors, prepared at different concentrations, were used. The cultures were incubated at 28 &#x000b0;C for 24 h. Following the incubation time, each culture plate was visually inspected in the region corresponding to each elicitor drop and classified accordingly to the changes in colony morphology in this spot (vide <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Elicitation&#x02014;large scale (liquid media): Selected strains were inoculated in 5 mL TSB (Tryptic Soy Broth&#x02014;LAMA585, LAMA627, LAMA639, B003_789, LAMA627, B004_912), MB (Marine Broth&#x02014;LAMA915) or YEME (Yeast Maltose Extract&#x02014;B002_754) at 28 &#x000b0;C, 200 rpm, for 2 h, 17 h or 24 h.

Then, elicitors were added at a previously established concentration on solid media experiments. Next, 40 g of Amberlite XADHP: Diaion HP-20 (1:1) resins were added to the liquid cultures after 24 h of bacterial growth in the presence of the elicitor, this being maintained for another 24 h for metabolite adsorption to the resin. The culture was filtered (membrane 0.22 &#x000b5;m) and washed with 400 mL Milli-Q water and 200 mL of methanol was added. After 48 h, the methanolic extract was separated by filtration. For second elution, 200 mL of methanol was added to the resin and after 1 h the suspension was sonicated for 15 min followed by filtration. Both elutions were combined, and the solvent was evaporated to completion in vacuo.</p><p>Pre-fractionated library preparation: Previously obtained extracts were resuspended in H<sub>2</sub>O:CH<sub>3</sub>OH:DMSO (2:1:1) to a 60 mg/mL concentration. Samples were fractionated by injection of 5 mL aliquots (~300 mg crude extract) onto a SunFire C18 OBD reversed-phase prep column (10 &#x003bc;M, 30 mm &#x000d7; 100 mm) attached to a compatible pre-column and coupled to an AutoPurification HPLC-PDA (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) system. A solvent system of water (A) and methanol (B) and the following analytical method was used: 12 mL/min flow rate; 0&#x02212;21 min 10% B to 50% B; 21&#x02212;27 min, 50% B to 100% B; 27&#x02212;30 min, 100% B; 30&#x02212;40 min for column equilibration. Fractions were collected in 36 mL/50 mL tubes. A solvent from each of 9 enriched fractions was evaporated to completion in vacuo.

The chemical samples were aliquoted (25 &#x000b5;l at 10 mg/mL) in 384-well plates, using half a row for each chromatographic series, containing the crude extract and the 9 fractions, totaling 18 crude extracts and 162 fractions. This layout was chosen to systematically evaluate the enrichment of metabolites by pre-fractionating the crude extracts, as previously suggested by Wagenaar [<xref rid="B51-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and Grkovic et al.

C was kept at 5% constantly (final concentration of 0.1%). The mass spectrometer worked in positive ion mode scanning mass from 30 to 1800 Da range, acquisition rate of 8 Hz.

The beta version is freely available in our repository (<uri xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/cnpemlqpn/np3_ms_workflow/src/master/">https://bitbucket.org/cnpemlqpn/np3_ms_workflow/src/master/</uri> (accessed on 18 December 2020)), with a detailed manual and a command line interface. The NP<sup>3</sup> MS workflow uses a metadata file manually constructed by the user to describe the LC-MS/MS files used in the job, the files types, their grouping information and bioactivity scores. For this job a metadata file with 229 mzXML files was compiled and the samples codes summarized the EPfB chemical library samples. The sample codes tracked information on the bacterial strain of origin, the growth conditions and the sample type. The bacterial strain code was the prefix of the samples code, which was followed by the growth condition with the name of the chemical elicitor, and the sample type as the suffix: 00 for crude extracts and 01 to 09 for fractions. As an example, L585_BUT50_09 is the nineth fraction of LAMA585 crude extract derived from LAMA585 growth in the presence of butyrate 50 &#x000b5;M; L585_00 refers to the crude extract of LAMA585 grown in the control condition (no chemical elicitor added); L585_07 is the seventh chromatographic fraction of LAMA585 crude extract in the control growth condition.

The links have a direction, pointing from the consensus spectra considered as an ion variant to the consensus spectra considered as a putative [M + H]<sup>+</sup> candidate in the respective annotation (e.g., [M+Na]+ -&#x0003e; [M + H]<sup>+</sup>).</p><p>Experimental MS/MS database dereplication with GNPS library: For including GNPS library identifications, the resulting MGF consensus spectra list from the NP<sup>3</sup> MS workflow was used as input in the GNPS website aiming dereplication of the EPfB library against the experimental MS/MS collection of GNPS [<xref rid="B23-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The GNPS spectra were filtered in the same manner as the input data. All matches kept between network spectra and library spectra were required to have a score above 0.65 and at least 6 matched peaks. The identifications from GNPS were combined in the &#x0201c;*_peak_area_clean_annotated.csv&#x0201d; table (NP<sup>3</sup> output) using the NP<sup>3</sup> MS workflow command &#x0201c;gnps_result &#x0201c;.</p><p>Selection of the [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra relative to bacterial metabolites: The IVAMN was used to remove the ions from the chromatographic blanks, chemical elicitors, and culture media samples. For this, the [M + H]<sup>+</sup> table (output &#x0201c;v&#x0201d; from NP<sup>3</sup>), the &#x0201c;*_peak_area_clean_annotated.csv&#x0201d; with GNPS results added, and the IVAMN edges file (output &#x0201c;iv&#x0201d; from NP<sup>3</sup>) were visualized in Cytoscape v3.8.0. Then, spectra clusters relative to blank or culture media were removed by manually filtering all the clusters that had at least one node present in BLANK, STANDARD or BED samples. With this, only the [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra remaining in the clean IVAMN, which are the most possible real bacteria metabolites, were selected and exported in a CSV table named &#x0201c;IVAMN_clean_protonated.csv&#x0201d;, together with the quantifications and identifications that were present in clean count table.</p><p>SSMN construction and analysis: The raw SSMN returned by the NP<sup>3</sup> MS workflow (output &#x0201c;iii&#x0201d; from NP<sup>3</sup>) was visualized with Cytoscape v3.8.0. Next, the &#x0201c;IVAMN_clean_protonated.csv&#x0201d; (bacterial metabolites list and attributes) was imported and used to filter only the nodes present in this list. As a result, the filtered SSMN nodes contained only the [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra relative to bacterial metabolites in the EPfB library. The SSMN edges file was exported as &#x0201c;SSMN_filtered_protonated.selfloops&#x0201d; for further use in the workflow. This filtered SSMN and its attributes from the &#x0201c;IVAMN_clean_protonated.csv&#x0201d; was used in the analyses presented in this work.</p><p>Cytoscape regex filter, based on the sample code format described above, were used to select and distinguish (colors, formats, etc) the network nodes according to the sample of origin, quantity in the sample of origin, chemical elicitation and sample type. The GNPS and UNPD identifications columns were used to select and distinguish the identified [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra relative to bacterial metabolites.</p><p>Spectra count: The quantification and identification columns of the &#x0201c;IVAMN_clean_protonated.csv&#x0201d; were used to count the bacterial metabolites in the different samples of the EPfB library and to prune novel compounds. Python scripts, helped by pandas library and matplotlib, were used for retrieving the data and plotting the bar charts.</p><p>Euler diagrams: A Python script counted all intersections, unions, and disjoints quantifications by sample and by database identification also using the &#x0201c;IVAMN_clean_protonated.csv&#x0201d; as input. The resulting numbers were the input for eulerr R library version 6.1.0 (<uri xlink:href="https://github.com/jolars/eulerr">https://github.com/jolars/eulerr</uri> (accessed on 25 April 2019)). Eulerr generates area-proportional Euler diagrams displaying set relationships.</p><p>Chemical space mapping: The evaluation of the chemical space was performed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using molecular descriptors extracted from each identified compound. The &#x0201c;IVAMN_clean_protonated.csv&#x0201d; file, which also contains the database identifications, was used to retrieve the smiles of the compounds suggested by databases as spectra matches to the EPfB library metabolites. Only the top-ranked smile string, based on MQscore, were used in the PCA analyses.</p><p>Chemical spaces were constructed based on the approach used in [<xref rid="B1-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] with minor modifications. The compounds deposited at the UNPD-ISDB and at the Drug Brank (set approved drugs) were used, along with the compounds identified from the elicited pre-fractionated bacterial (EPfB) chemical library reported here. The calculation of all molecular descriptors for each dataset was preformed using the CDK<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> v2.0 package (<uri xlink:href="https://cdk.github.io/">https://cdk.github.io/</uri> (accessed on 25 April 2019)) [<xref rid="B39-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Duplicates were removed. The following descriptors were used: topological (<italic>n</italic> = 195), constitutional (<italic>n</italic> = 17) and geometric (<italic>n</italic> = 49) and only uncorrelated descriptors were considered for the PCA analysis, chosen through a Spearman&#x02019;s correlation matrix. The descriptors used in the PCA were: ALogp2, C1SP2, C1SP3, C3SP2, C3SP3, LipinskiFailures, MDEC.22, MDEC.33, MDEN.12, MDEN.22, MDEN.23, MDEO.22, nAcid, nBase, nRingBlocks, nRings7, WTPT.5 and XLogP.</p><p>Non-identified metabolites, that showed spectra similarity with identified ones, were introduced to the chemical space map using the information of spectra similarity present in the links of the filtered SSMN (file: &#x0201c;SSMN_filtered_protonated.selfloops&#x0201d; mentionated above).</p><p>The same PCA constructed for known and identified compounds was used; however, the representation of the points containing non-identified similar compounds was modified as follows: identified compounds were represented in the chemical space by a cross, whereas compounds bringing non-identified similar spectra were further represented by circles, in which the size of the circle was weighted according to the number of non-identified similar spectra linked to a given identified compound of the EPfB chemical library. In this way, a non-identified spectrum was added to the chemical space, being represented by its most similar identified neighbor. The smaller circle represents one similar compound connected and the bigger one represents two. Redundancies to other links were avoided by only considering directly connected nodes, a similarity cut-off of cosine &#x02265;0.6 and further filters as explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00107-f004">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>Biological assays: The 180 samples of the EPfB library (18 crude extracts and 162 fractions) were screened in four bioassays. Proteasome screening was performed as previously reported [<xref rid="B55-metabolites-11-00107" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Human 20S proteasome was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences and LLVY-AMC fluorogenic substrate (specific for the ChTL subunit) from Boston Biosciences.

Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the EPfB chemical library represents a chemically diverse collection for drug discovery efforts. This library was produced by uncommon bacteria, from which metabolites were induced by chemical elicitation and evidenced by fractionation of the crude extracts. This pilot work pinpoints strategies for constructing and evaluating larger and chemically diverse bacterial natural product libraries, including extreme environment bacteria, such as the LAMA deep-sea bacteria collection. The reported methods and findings will assist further work towards the identification of novel bacterial secondary metabolites in natural product-based drug discovery pipelines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Authors thank Marjorie Bruder for English editing.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-metabolites-11-00107"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/11/2/107/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/11/2/107/s1</uri>.

Identified nodes are represented in squares; relative peak areas are represented in the pie-chart, colored according to the elicited growth condition: ampicillin (blue), kanamycin (magenta), procaine (purple), sodium butyrate (red), EDTA (green) and control conditions (white).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="metabolites-11-00107-g005"/></fig><fig id="metabolites-11-00107-f006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>PCA based on molecular descriptors of compounds detected and identified in the EPfB library shows that the retrieved bacterial metabolites cover the chemical space of the approved drugs. (<bold>a</bold>) Chemical space coverage of identified compounds from consensus spectra exclusively detected in the following growth conditions: elicited (blue), controls (white) and both (yellow). Compounds found in the bioactive fractions are denoted by a red edge. For reference, compounds present in the UNPD-ISDB database (<italic>n</italic> = 208,009 natural products) and the DrugBank (subset of approved drugs, <italic>n</italic> = 2078 drugs) were also used in the PCA analysis and are shown in grey and salmon, respectively. A zoomed view at the central region of the PCA is shown in the inset for better visualization. (<bold>b</bold>) The PC1 and PC2 axes that separate the four quadrants (Q1 to Q4) are shown in black dotted lines. The main variables of contributing molecular descriptors are shown and labeled.

(<bold>a</bold>) A principal component analysis was performed based on molecular descriptors of identified [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra detected in this work. Each identified compound is represented by a cross in the plots and the circles denote the occurrence of non-identified analogous [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra in the collection. Circle size corresponds to the number of non-identified neighbors connected to the identified compound in the SSMN. Compounds 1&#x02013;5 are highlighted purple, orange, cyan, green and magenta. (<bold>b</bold>) The PCA plot was split based on the cultivation method employed for bacterial cultures (growth condition: control (white), elicited (blue) and both (yellow)), and further by the sample type in which the spectra were found (sample type: chromatographic fraction (minor compounds) or both (major compounds)). Compounds derived from bioactive fractions are highlighted in grey (LAMA915), green (LAMA639) and red (B002_754). Representative compounds from the spectra databases used for metabolite identification, sharing spectra similarity to the EPfB [M + H]<sup>+</sup> consensus spectra, were selected and are represented; 6: tentoxin; 7: mucronine J; 8: nummularine F; 9: cyclic tetrapeptide (PheProPhePro); 10: daphnicyclidin; 11: hyrtiazepine; 12: ulongamide D; and 13: cystodytin C.
