The results indicated that the abundances of the detected ARGs ranged from 3.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> to 1.13 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> copies/g. The ARGs with the highest abundance was <italic>sul2</italic>, and the lowest was <italic>blaCTX</italic>. Composting removes most of the ARGs and MGEs by 22.8&#x02013;99.7%. These ARGs were significantly reduced during the thermophilic phase of compost. The removal rate of ARGs at the different layers of compost pile was different as follows: middle layer &#x0003e; upper layer &#x0003e; lower layer. But some ARGs proliferated significantly in the maturation phase of compost, especially the sulfonamide resistance genes. Compound microbial inoculants increased the temperature of compost, accelerated water loss, nitrogen fixation, and increased the removal rate of &#x003b2;-lactamase resistance genes, the transposon gene <italic>tn916</italic> and part of tetracycline resistance genes by 3.7&#x02013;23.8% in compost. Compound microbial inoculants changed the community structure and increased the <italic>Bacillus</italic> abundance in the thermophilic phase of compost. And it was helpful for removing pathogens during composting. The addition of compound microbial inoculants causes the decrease of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and the increase of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, which may be related to the removal and proliferation of ARGs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>swine manure</kwd><kwd>aerobic composting</kwd><kwd>compound microbial inoculants</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance genes</kwd><kwd>16S rRNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn1">the National Key R&#x00026;D Program of China</funding-source><award-id rid="cn1">2018YFD0500204</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn2">the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</funding-source><award-id rid="cn2">2662019FW012</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn3">the Science and Technology Program of Wuhan, China</funding-source><award-id rid="cn3">2016020101010091</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="34"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="6405"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With the rapid development of intensive culture, antibiotics have been widely used in feed for promoting growth and for disease prevention purposes. However, antibiotics in animal tissues are absorbed incompletely; parts of antibiotics are excreted in urine and feces (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). Antibiotic residues cause serious pollution to the environment, pose a threat to human health, and even have toxic side effects (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Sarmah et al., 2006</xref>). If the residual antibiotics in the environment do not degrade effectively, these residues may help to maintain or develop antibiotic-resistant microbial populations (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Witte, 1998</xref>). Additionally, the migration of antibiotics in the environment has led to the spread of resistant genes as a new type of environmental pollutant. Manure carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) can enter soil, following direct land application (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2015</xref>). Many studies have shown that the diversity and abundance of ARGs in soil with long-term application of livestock manure has increased significantly (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), and ARGs in farmland have also increased significantly (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Mu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the removal of ARGs from swine manure has emerged as an environmental issue before its application to soil.</p><p>Aerobic composting is one of the most effective ways to realize the harmless and resourceful treatment of livestock and poultry manure. Aerobic composting can significantly reduce the concentration of antibiotics in animal manure (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2017</xref>), but there is little research on whether ARGs can undergo compost removal. Previous studies show that aerobic composting has various effects on different ARGs (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Joy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2015</xref>). It has been found that the relative abundances of the tetracycline resistance genes and sulfonamide resistance genes were significantly reduced during the swine manure composting, while quinolone resistance gene still partially remained (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Selvam et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, composting is most likely an effective way to remove ARGs.</p><p>Microbes are the main carriers of ARGs. Several studies have used 16S rRNA sequencing technology to analyze the relationship between ARGs and microbial communities in compost (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). A large number of studies have shown that exogenous microbial agents can accelerate the composting process and shorten the composting cycle (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Nakasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Ravindran et al., 2019</xref>). However, the current research focuses more on the observation of the application effect of a single functional strain (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>). And the impact of inoculation on ARGs is even less studied. Only <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al. (2019)</xref> studied the effects of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during cattle manure composting. But in practical application, the addition of compound microbial agents is often used to accelerate the composting process. Previous study also showed that compound microbial inoculants can improve composting efficiency of organic solid wastes (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Ravindran et al., 2019</xref>). Our previous studies have found that <italic>Bacillus</italic> is the main dominant bacterium in the high-temperature period of primitive composting (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2012</xref>). Exogenous <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. may prolong the high-temperature composting time and better kill resistant microorganisms. Thus, in the present study, we delved into the effects of <italic>Bacillus</italic> compound microbial inoculants on composting microbial communities and ARGs. At present, research on these effects has not been reported.</p><p>The main aims of the present study were: (1) to investigate the quantitative variation and spatial distribution of ARGs in different periods and different height layers in compost, (2) to use 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology to investigate the dynamic changes of bacterial community structure and composition in compost with the addition of a compound microbial inoculants, and (3) to analyze the correlation between microbial community changes and ARGs. We also detected the relative abundances of pathogenic bacteria during composting. The results of this study may help with the development of high-efficiency microbial agents for the control of ARGs, which is of great significance to guide the application of microbial agents in composting and to further improve composting efficiency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Description of Raw Materials</title><p>Fresh swine manure was taken from the boutique pig farm of Huazhong Agricultural University. Sawdust from the Veterinary Hospital of Huazhong Agricultural University was approximately 0.5&#x02013;1 cm in size.

Each composting device was a 60-L rectangular foam container (280 &#x000d7; 540 &#x000d7; 400 cm). And it was perforated with one ventilation hole (2 &#x000d7; 2 cm) on the side of the insulation wall. The composting device is very similar to the research from <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al. (2019)</xref>.

Samples collected on days 0 (initial phase), 1 (mesophilic phase), 2 (thermophilic phase), 5 (cooling phase), 12 (maturation phase), and 32 (maturation phase) were designated as detection ARGs samples. At the same time, samples collected on days 1 (mesophilic phase), 2 (thermophilic phase), and 32 (maturation phase) were used to analyze changes in microbial community structure. Each sample was split into two parts: one part was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for subsequent DNA extraction, and another part was stored at 4&#x000b0;C for later chemical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Physicochemical Index Analyses</title><p>The temperature at the center of each composting container was measured at 9:00 AM daily using a thermometer. At the same time, the room temperature was also recorded daily. Each compost sample and deionized water were mixed at a ratio of 1:10 W(g): V(ml) and shaken at room temperature for 1 h. The pH of the extract was measured. Moisture content was measured by drying in an oven at 105&#x000b0;C for 24 h or until no change in dry weight.

The results are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Swine manure aerobic composting was performed for 32 days. The maximum temperature in AB was 62.1&#x000b0;C, the maximum temperature in CK was 60.9&#x000b0;C, and the temperatures of the two groups both lasted more than 3 days above 55&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). It reached the standard of harmless treatment of reactor compost. The moisture content continued to decline during composting and that of the AB group dropped faster than the CK group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This is because the microbial activity in the AB group compost was stronger, the temperature during the thermophilic phase was higher, and the high temperature lasted longer, so the water loss rate was more rapid. The pH increased gradually in the early stage of composting and declined slowly and stabilized (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In the early stage of composting, the ammonification was strong, the pH value rose rapidly, and the nitrification increased in the maturation phase; then, the pH value began to decrease, and the final pH value was stable between 8 and 9. The TC content in composting process showed a downward trend (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The carbon content of the AB group declined rapidly during the thermophilic phase, which may indicate strong microbial activity in the early stage of composting and converting the organic matter into carbon dioxide or minerals. The change in TN content of the composting piles first decreased and then increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The content of TN in the AB group was higher than that in the CK group in the maturation phase, which may be attributable to compound microbial inoculants playing a role in nitrogen preservation. The initial carbon and nitrogen ratio of the material was &#x02053;20. At the end of composting, the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the AB group was 13.15 and that of the CK group was 15.08 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Both compost groups reached a mature state. The above results show that adding compound microbial inoculants can increase the maximum temperature of compost, prolong the high-temperature period, and accelerate water loss and nitrogen fixation during swine manure composting. The addition of compound microbial inoculants can accelerate and strengthen the composting process and improve the fertilizer efficiency of composting products.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Physicochemical changes during swine manure composting. <bold>(A)</bold> Temperature, <bold>(B)</bold> moisture, <bold>(C)</bold> pH, <bold>(D)</bold> TC, <bold>(E)</bold> TN, and <bold>(F)</bold> C/N in the two treatment conditions during the composting process.

Some ARGs were significantly reduced during the thermophilic phase. This demonstrated that thermophilic phase of aerobic composting plays important roles in the removal of ARGs, which is consistent with the previous studies (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). But some ARGs proliferated significantly in the late period of composting. Our results show that three tetracycline ARGs, three macrolide ARGs, and two sulfonamide ARGs and <italic>intI1</italic> proliferated during the late composting period. It has been found that <italic>intI1</italic> is closely related to macrolide ARGs and sulfonamide ARGs (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2015</xref>). So the proliferation of ARGs may be involved in the <italic>intI1</italic>-mediated HGT (Horizontal gene transfer) process.</p><p>This study found that the addition of compound microbial inoculants could remove more ARGs and MGEs than natural composting. It could be that the compound microbial inoculants may kill the host bacteria carrying ARGs or high temperature inhibited HGT and eliminated some ARG hosts. However, composting process had a greater impact on ARGs than compound microbial inoculants. In this study, the composting process removes most of ARGs and MGEs by 22.8&#x02013;99.7%, but compound microbial inoculants only increased the removal rate of part of ARGs by 3.7&#x02013;23.8% in compost. This is consistent with the research results of <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al. (2019)</xref>. And composting could not remove the ARGs completely. Some ARGs showed more proliferation in the AB group than in the CK group at the end of composting. This may be related to the change of the community structure of compost with the addition of compound microbial inoculants. Microorganisms carrying ARGs proliferate in large numbers in the maturation phase of composting. Some <italic>thermophilic</italic> bacteria may be the hosts of ARGs (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Similar to <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Awasthi et al. (2019)</xref> and <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2020)</xref>, microbial community composition was the most direct factor affecting ARGs during composting. The richness and diversity of microbial communities in the composting process showed a downward trend in the maturation phase of composting, which also explained why most ARGs were reduced. First, the decrease of microbial density constrains the horizontal transfer process of ARGs (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Second, due to the decrease of bacterial diversity, the host bacteria of ARGs were also reduced (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). At the same time, our research also indicated that the relative abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> decreased, but <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> were increased in the maturation phase of compost. <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al. (2019)</xref> pointed out that <italic>Firmicutes</italic> are the main cause of ARGs changes during cattle manure composting. It has been reported that a decrease in the relative abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> might explain the removal of most ARGs in compost (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Huerta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Stegmann et al., 2015</xref>). <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al.

(2020)</xref> indicated that <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> were the primary potential host of ARGs during commercial livestock manure composting. It follows that the proliferation of some ARGs may be related to the increase of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> in maturation phase. The analysis at the genus level verifies the above conclusions. The abundance of <italic>Bacillus</italic> has decreased significantly, and it has been replaced by <italic>Sphingobacterium</italic>, <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic>, <italic>Cellvibrio</italic>, etc., in maturation phase, which are closely related to the proliferation of part ARGs. These bacteria belong to <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> or <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>.</p><p>The addition of compound microbial inoculants altered the microbial community in the compost. The <italic>Bacillus</italic> abundance was higher in the thermophilic phase than that of the control group. <italic>Bacillus</italic> is the most important component in the compound microbial inoculants. This also directly proves the effect and experimental reliability of adding compound microbial inoculants. At the same time, our research also indicated that the relative abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> decreased, but <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> were increased in the maturation phase of compost by adding compound microbial inoculants. Among them, <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> change greatly. The succession of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> during the composting may be the potential driver for ARGs alteration. The relative abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in group AB was significantly lower than that in group CK. This also explains that the removal of ARGs in the AB group was higher than that in the CK group.</p><p>Most environmental factors were significantly correlated with microbial community. <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2019)</xref> pointed out that environmental factors may not directly affect ARGs, but may indirectly affect the changes of ARGs by influencing microbial community. <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al. (2019)</xref> found <italic>B. subtilis</italic> at 0.5% could cause a change in compost&#x02019;s pH, thereby reducing ARGs during cattle manure composting. However, there was no significant difference in pH between the two groups in this study, which had little impact on the microbial community. We also found that there were large numbers of pathogens in the compost material by analyzed the changes of microbial communities at the genus level. Previous study has also shown that most of the host bacteria of ARGs are pathogens (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Our results showed that compost removes most of the pathogens and the addition of compound microbial inoculants helped with the removal of pathogens. <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al. (2020)</xref> also found the relative abundance of potential HPB decreased by 74.6 and 91.4% at the end of vacuum-type composting and positive-pressure composting, respectively. But a recent study shows that the total relative abundance of pathogens did not obviously decline with the composting progressing during commercial livestock manure composting (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). This result is inconsistent with ours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Composting removes most of the ARGs and MGEs.
