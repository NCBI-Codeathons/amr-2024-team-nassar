With the rise in available genome sequences, resistance gene&#x02013;guided genome mining has emerged as a powerful tool to identify natural products targeting a specific protein of interest. This approach relies on the insight that in some biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), the producing organism encodes within the BGC a resistance gene in the form of a copy of the molecular target of the BGC&#x02019;s product (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). This resistance gene is not required for the biosynthesis of any natural products but serves to protect the host from the toxicity of its own metabolites. In fungi, this phenomenon was first appreciated with the identification of a copy of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase within the lovastatin BGC of <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus terreus</italic> (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Multiple other resistance gene&#x02013;encoding BGCs have since been identified in fungi (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), including BGCs that produce inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis (squalestatin (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), restricticin (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and hymeglusin (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)), the proteasome (fellutamide B (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)), glycolysis (heptelidic acid (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)), oxidative phosphorylation (aurovertin and citreoviridin (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)), and calcineurin (cyclosporine A (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)). In each of these cases, the identification of a resistance gene validated the relationship between a known natural product and a molecular target that had been empirically determined previously, in some cases decades prior to the characterization of the BGC. More recently, resistance gene&#x02013;guided genome mining has been used more prospectively to identify aspterric acid (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) as an inhibitor of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, a promising point of intervention for herbicides for use in agriculture. Here, we extend this approach to the identification of <bold>1</bold> as an inhibitor of CDK2 demonstrating the use of resistance gene&#x02013;guided genome mining in fungi for the identification of an inhibitor of a clinically validated target in oncology.</p><p>Fungal natural products have been shown to be potent and specific inhibitors of a variety of human kinases (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). With this in mind, we sought to use resistance gene&#x02013;guided mining of fungal genomes to identify inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The CDKs are a family of kinases that are critical factors in both the control of the cell cycle and protein translation. In fungi, the CDK family comprises 6 proteins. In humans, this family has diverged to comprise 20 proteins (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The misregulation of several CDK proteins in a variety of cancers makes them attractive drug targets (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Several inhibitors of the CDK protein family have been identified using both traditional screening and computational methods (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These include synthetic compounds dinaciclib (<bold>2</bold>, CDK2/5/9) (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and palbociclib (<bold>5</bold>, CDK4/6) (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) along with flavopiridol (<bold>3</bold>, CDK1/2/4/7) (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and butyrolactone I (<bold>4</bold>, CDK2) (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), two compounds of natural origin (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Here, we expand the list of CDK inhibitors by using resistance gene&#x02013;guided genome mining to identify a family of BGCs present across multiple genomes that encode a resistance gene with homology to human CDK2. Through a combination of in situ cluster engineering in <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus uvarum</italic> and heterologous expression in <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, we demonstrate that these BGCs produce roseopurpurin C (<bold>1</bold>), a depsidone natural product. We characterize the activity of <bold>1,</bold> revealing it as a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of CDK2 (<italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub>iapp</sub> of 44 nM) with selectivity for CDK family kinases which induces G1 phase cell cycle arrest. We profile several precursors and shunt products of <bold>1</bold> to define a preliminary structure&#x02013;activity relationship, and, in combination with the co-crystal structure of <bold>1</bold> bound to human CDK2, we define the structural basis for CDK2 engagement.</p><fig position="float" id="fig01" fig-type="featured"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Characterized inhibitors of human CDKs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pnas.2310522120fig01" position="float"/></fig><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>Identification and Characterization of the Roseopurpurin BGC.</title><p>To find gene clusters capable of producing inhibitors of CDK2, we looked within our library of annotated BGCs for those that contained a gene encoding a protein that had &#x02265;50% amino acid identity with human CDK2.

The biosynthetic enzymes encoded in these BGCs comprise one nonreducing-polyketide synthase (NR-PKS) core protein, multiple putative tailoring enzymes, a cluster-specific transcription factor, a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, and a CDK2 homolog. Metabolites are produced by BGCs through the combined activity of the enzymes encoded by the core genes and most or all of the tailoring genes. The consecutive nature of the transformations in these pathways leads to the production of multiple metabolites, as both intermediates and shunt products, at varying levels of maturity from a single BGC. From a therapeutic discovery perspective, it is valuable to profile the bioactivity of metabolites at all stages of maturation, as each metabolite provides potentially valuable data information about the structure&#x02013;activity relationship of the compound class.</p><fig position="float" id="fig02" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Biosynthesis of <bold>1</bold>.

As demonstrated here, this approach can also provide an advanced starting point for drug discovery as the metabolites have already been evolutionarily engineered to interact with their target. Additional structure&#x02013;activity relationship information can be obtained by screening precursor metabolites and shunt products for binding and bioactivity, resulting in a well-developed data package prior to initiating any additional work (i.e., a medicinal chemistry campaign).</p><p>The availability of large numbers of microbial genomes presents opportunities for resistance gene&#x02013;guided genome mining. The number of BGCs is large: up to 100 per genome, across thousands of genomes. Here, we apply this technique to reveal the molecular targets of the known compound <bold>1</bold>; demonstrating that it is a potent and specific inhibitor of the CDKs.</p><p>To identify natural product inhibitors of human CDK2, we looked for BGCs containing a putative resistance gene with homology to human CDKs, ultimately identifying the roseopurpurin BGC in the genomes of <italic toggle="yes">A. uvarum</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Phaeosphaeria</italic> sp. TTI001159 and five additional publicly available fungal genomes (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2310522120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>). In order to identify the products of these clusters, we first characterized this BGC by in situ engineering, generating mutants with the core NR-PKS knocked out and the BGC-specific transcription factor overexpressed. The results from these in situ engineering studies facilitated the identification of a series of BGC products and provided insights into the possible regulation of this BGC. The titers of early pathway intermediates <bold>6</bold> and <bold>7</bold> are detectable across all conditions tested and are influenced to a relatively small extent by transcription factor overexpression. <bold>1</bold>, the most bioactive cluster product, is produced by the wild-type strain at significant levels in only a few growth conditions and its titer is increased significantly, in some cases several orders of magnitude, upon transcription factor overexpression (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2310522120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2</ext-link>). These results suggest that the regulation of this BGC is not as simple as it being &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;off&#x0201d;, as transcriptional control appears much tighter for those enzymes responsible for the later steps in the pathway.</p><p>Further characterization of this cluster by heterologous expression in <italic toggle="yes">A. nidulans</italic> yielded additional insights. In addition to establishing a series of transformations ultimately leading to the formation of <bold>1</bold>, we found glyoxalase RosD leads to the conversion of <bold>1</bold> to <bold>11</bold>. <bold>11</bold> proved significantly less potent than <bold>1</bold> in both biochemical and cellular assays (<xref rid="fig03" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">4<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>), leading us to hypothesize that the primary role of RosD is detoxification. This BGC also contains <italic toggle="yes">rosJ</italic>, a gene encoding a MFS drug pump; a feature common in fungal BGCs and that has been shown to be a mechanism of self-protection (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) in addition to the putative resistance gene <italic toggle="yes">rosG</italic>.</p><p>While this work was in progress, a report emerged of human CDK2 inhibition by <bold>1</bold> and <bold>12</bold> isolated from cultures of <italic toggle="yes">A. fumigatus</italic>, a species whose genome contains the rosepurpurin gene cluster (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), corroborating our observations that these metabolites are inhibitors of human CDK2. By profiling the activity of <bold>1</bold> against a panel of human kinases, we demonstrate that it is both potent and quite specific for the CDK1/2/3, CDK5, and CDK4/6 kinase subfamilies. That we see good selectivity for these CDK subfamilies, but only modest selectivity within them is likely caused by the significant divergence in the evolution of the CDKs between fungi and humans and the ATP-competitive mechanism of inhibition. Most fungal species have only 6 CDK paralogs, while the human genome has 20. Indeed, the entire CDK1/2/3/4/6 and CDK5 subfamilies can each be traced back to a single homolog in fungi, represented by CDC28 and Pho85 in <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Outside of the CDK branch of the CMGC kinase family, nanomolar inhibition of two CAMK family Ser/Thr kinases, AMPK&#x003b1;1 and CAMK4 was observed (<xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2310522120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Figs. S9 and S10</ext-link>). This potent inhibition can likely be explained based on alignments of the <bold>1</bold>-CDK2 structure with published AMPK&#x003b1;1 (PDB 4CFF) and CAMK4 structures (PDB 2W4O), which reveal that the key <bold>1</bold>-CDK2 binding interactions are maintained with both proteins despite significant sequence divergence in the ATP-binding pockets (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2310522120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Figs. S12&#x02013;S14</ext-link>).</p><p>The structure of <bold>1</bold>-bound CDK2 revealed that ATP-competitive inhibition was achieved through binding to the ATP pocket of CDK2 and provided a structural rationale for the preliminary structure&#x02013;activity relationships obtained through profiling precursor metabolites and shunt products in the <bold>1</bold> maturation pathway. Three key hydrogen-bonding interactions were identified in the structure. First, the 3&#x02032;-OH group of <bold>1</bold> interacts with the amide backbone of Glu81 and Leu83 in the hinge region of CDK2. Similar hinge-region interactions are observed for structurally diverse natural products with ATP-competitive kinase inhibitory activity (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and synthetic kinase inhibitors, including dinaciclib (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Second, the 4-OH group of <bold>1</bold> forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp86. Epimerization of the 4-OH in <bold>1</bold> to afford <bold>12</bold> results in a 50-fold reduction in potency (<xref rid="fig03" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>). Furthermore, comparison of the potency of <bold>8</bold> (which lacks the 4-OH) and <bold>7</bold>, reveals that the addition of this critical hydrogen-bond donor improves potency by approximately ninefold (<xref rid="fig03" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>). Third, the 9&#x02032;-carbonyl of <bold>1</bold>, forms a hydrogen bond with Asp145. The coordination of this central ring potentially helps orient the metabolite in the binding site. Consistent with this prediction, <bold>11</bold> is approximately 900-fold less active than <bold>1</bold>.</p><p><bold>1</bold> represents a new scaffold for type 1 kinase inhibitors of CDK proteins. The potency and specificity of its activity demonstrate the utility of resistance gene&#x02013;guided genome mining to identify metabolites with bioactivities relevant to human disease. Combined with the initial SAR that arises from profiling intermediate metabolites in the biosynthetic pathway, this work demonstrates the ability of this approach to yield advanced starting points for drug discovery campaigns. Furthermore, fungi and humans share thousands of genes with significant homology (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), giving resistance gene&#x02013;guided genome mining of fungal genomes the potential to generate inhibitors of promising targets across a wide range of disease areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s8"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s9"><title>Reagent Sourcing.</title><p>Unguinol, leoidin, nornidulin, stictic acid, nidulin, lobaric acid, salazinic acid, penicillide, galbinic acid, 7-chlorofolipastatin, folipastatin, and psoromic acid were sourced from Cayman chemicals.

Thirty microliters of FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega) was added to each milliliter of DNA mixture. The lipid-DNA mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Postincubation, 10 mL of cells was added to the lipid&#x02013;DNA mixture and plated in a 96-well clear bottom white plate (Corning 3903) at a concentration of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. Cells were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 20 to 30 h.</p><p>Posttransfection, the media were replaced with fresh Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum, no phenol red medium. NanoBRET Tracer reagent K-10 (NV2641) was added at a concentration of 50 &#x003bc;M (1% DMSO final) along with 0.2% DMSO (&#x000b1; inhibitor). Plates were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 2 h. Following incubation, plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 15 min. A 3&#x000d7; Complete Substrate Plus Inhibitor Solution was made by adding 30 &#x003bc;L of NanoBRET Nano-Glo Substrate (Promega), 10 &#x003bc;L of Extracellular NanoLuc Inhibitor (Promega), and 4,960 &#x003bc;L of Opti-MEM reduced serum medium, no phenol red (Invitrogen). Fifty microliters of 3&#x000d7; Complete Substrate Plus Inhibitor Solution was added to each well, and the BRET signals (450 nm donor emission; 610 nm acceptor emission) were read on a GloMax Discover plate reader (Promega). A raw BRET ratio was generated by dividing the acceptor emission value by the donor emission value for each sample and compared to DMSO (0% inhibition) and 10 &#x000b5;M dinaciclib (100% inhibition) controls. IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated from the dose&#x02013;response curves using Prism 9 (four-parameter, variable slope). Experiments were performed in triplicate with technical duplicates in each run.</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Cell Cycle Analysis Assay.</title><p>HCT-116 (ATCC CCL-247) cells were grown in DMEM + GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific 10566-016) supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific 16140-071) at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For synchronization, cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in DMEM + GlutaMAX supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 96 h. After 96 h, the media were replaced with DMEM + GlutaMAX with 10% FBS, and test compounds in DMSO were added. DMSO levels were normalized. Cells were incubated for 24 at 37 &#x000b0;C and 5% CO2. Two hours prior to harvest, 20 &#x000b5;M of EdU was added from the Click-iT Plus EdU Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific C10633) to the media and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 2 h, the media were removed, and cells were washed once with PBS and trypsinized. Cells were collected in a v-bottom 96-well plate and spun at 300 g for 5 min and washed again with PBS. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with eBiosciences FoxP3/Transcription factor fixation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific 00-5523-00) for 20 min. After fixation, cells were spun at 800 &#x000d7; g and washed twice with permeabilization buffer. Click-iT Plus reaction cocktail was added and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with permeabilization buffer and spun at 800 &#x000d7; g. Cells were stained with pHH3 for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with permeabilization buffer and spun at 800 &#x000d7; g. FxCycle Violet (Thermo Fisher Scientific F10347) was added at a concentration of 1 &#x000b5;g/mL for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, cells were immediately acquired on a MACSQuant 10 cytometer (Miltenyi). Analysis was performed with Flowjo (BD Biosciences).
