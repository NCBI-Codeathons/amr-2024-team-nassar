In this work, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells were treated with prodigiosin to determine its antimicrobial effect on bacterial physiology. The effect of prodigiosin was concentration dependent. In prodigiosin treated cells above MIC value no significant DNA damage or cytoplasmic membrane disintegration was observed. The outer membrane, however, becomes leaky. Cells had severely decreased respiration activity. In prodigiosin treated cells protein and RNA synthesis were inhibited, cells were elongated but could not divide. Pre-treatment with prodigiosin improved <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> survival rate in media containing ampicillin, kanamycin and erythromycin but not phleomycin. The results suggest that prodigiosin acts as a bacteriostatic agent in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells. If prodigiosin was diluted, cells resumed growth.

Microorganisms exposed to antimicrobial stressors have evolved a variety of specific adaptive and protective mechanisms, which include changes in cell membrane, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, gene expression, biofilm formation, and production of small bioactive molecules [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In particular small bioactive compounds can shape metabolism and enhance survival of bacterial community in the environment [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The red pigment prodigiosin is produced as a secondary metabolite by many bacterial species [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It has an antibacterial, antiprotozoal, anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activity [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite decades of research, the mechanism underlying its antibacterial activity remains poorly explained. It has been demonstrated that prodigiosin inhibits growth of a wide spectrum of Gram positive bacteria including <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, as well as Gram negative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> and <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For a producer to survive it should be self-resistant to prodigiosin. It has been shown that in prodigiosin producing <italic>Streptomyces griseoviridis</italic> species <italic>rphA1</italic> and <italic>rphA2</italic> ABC-transporter genes are important for self-resistance [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The bacteria that do not have such homologues are prodigiosin sensitive. Prodigiosin as an antibacterial agent has high potential in biotechnological and medical applications [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], as well as in microbial ecology due to its ability to modulate bacterial ecophysiology [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It was shown that prodigiosin impregnated to cellulose matrix effectively removes <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cereus</italic> from contaminated water [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recently the induction of autolysins in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and other <italic>Bacillus</italic> species has been demonstrated as a potent antibacterial mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Different studies [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported inhibitory effect of prodigiosin on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. The MIC value of prodigiosin for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> MG1655 was determined to be 103.4 &#x000b1; 6.3 mg L<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which is moderate compared to some other known <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> antimicrobial agents [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, several studies showed no effect of prodigiosin on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Because the mechanism of prodigiosin&#x000b4;s action on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is not known, the conflicting data of prodigiosin antibacterial action are difficult to reconcile. As several ecopysiological roles of prodigiosin have been proposed for bacteria such as air dispersal of bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], metabolic sink for NAD(P)H or proline [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], storage of light energy [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], anion exchange [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], energy spilling function [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and UV protection [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], it is possible that antimicrobial activity is not the result of prodigiosin aiming at a single cell target, but in turn may have a pleiotropic effect on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> physiology. Many antimicrobial agents are indeed known to have multiple effects on microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the effect of prodigiosin on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> physiological behaviour was studied. Different modes of prodigiosin antibacterial activity were tested, including DNA cleavage, induction of SOS response, the effect on cell membrane integrity, metabolic activity, as well as survival of prodigiosin pre-treated cells in media containing different antibiotics. The results indicate a multifaceted physiological response to prodigiosin in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, very different from antimicrobial effect of prodigiosin described in a model bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Prodigiosin extract</title><p>Prodigiosin was extracted from <italic>Vibrio</italic> sp.

To address physiological response to prodigiosin, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells were grown at optimal conditions. Prodigiosin was added to the growing culture in the middle of the exponential phase. If 120 mg L<sup>-1</sup> prodigiosin was added immediately after culture inoculation, no growth of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was observed. As given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162412.g001">Fig 1</xref> prodigiosin added at concentrations 10 and 60 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, which are below MIC value (103.4 mg L<sup>-1</sup>), reduced the growth rate of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> 2.5 and 3 fold, respectively. Beside this, the addition of 60 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of prodigiosin induced a two-hour growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162412.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Nevertheless after 24 hours of incubation optical density of control and prodigiosin treated cultures were comparable. At concentrations above MIC (i.e. 120 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> population ceased to grow immediately after the addition of prodigiosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162412.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The transient increase in optical density is attributed to the added prodigiosin, which was subsequently incorporated in the bacterial cells, and not to the bacterial growth. At the end of the incubation there was a significant difference in optical density between the control and prodigiosin treated cultures. The amount of prodigiosin incorporated into the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells was dependent on the applied concentration (i.e. 22.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup> or 41.1 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, when treated with 60 mg L<sup>-1</sup> or 120 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of prodigiosin, respectively). This is approximately 30&#x02013;40% of the added amount.

Due to its physicochemical properties prodigiosin most likely accumulated into the lipid bilayer [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], although prodigiosin presence in the cytoplasm has been observed as well [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0162412.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0162412.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The influence of different prodigiosin concentrations on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> MG1655 growth.</title><p>Cells were grown in LB medium at 37&#x000b0;C and 200 rpm and treated in the middle of the exponential phase with 10 (A), 60 (B) and 120 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (C) of prodigiosin (filled symbols) or non-treated control (open symbols).

In the prodigiosin treated culture majority of the cells were intact and we found only few with emanating fluorescence halo that indicates cell membrane disintegration and DNA leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162412.g002">Fig 2</xref>). No such damage was caused, when cells were treated with ethanol or were keept only in growth medium (negative control). On the other hand, when cells were treated with cell wall targeting antibiotic ampicillin (positive control), DNA leaked out of the cells and produced a visible fluorescence halo around the cells. The viability and membrane integrity have also been checked with Live/Dead BacLight viability assay (<xref rid="pone.0162412.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Prodigiosin affected cell viability after one hour (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and approximately 15% drop in viability was determined, which did not changed with further incubation (<xref rid="pone.0162412.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). At the same time, the control (ethanol treated cells) remained viable for 5 hours. We conclude that prodigiosin has a minor effect on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cell viability and that the majority of cells had intact membranes after prodigiosin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162412.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162412.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

To check if the outer membrane of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is compromised after prodigiosin treatment, a nitrocefin hydrolysis assay was used [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In case of leakage, &#x003b2; &#x02013;lactamase is released from the cell periplasm and degrades nitrocefin, which is present in the medium. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162412.g003">Fig 3</xref> show that &#x003b2; &#x02013;lactamase activity of prodigiosin treated cells was significantly higher already after one hour of treatment with prodigiosin and increased even more after 5 hours of treatment as compared to the control. The results imply that the outer membrane, but not the cytoplasmic membrane, is damaged after prodigiosin treatment. It should be noted, however, that prodigiosin treated cells were morphologically different compared to the control cells. After 21.5 h of incubation, the control cells were 1.9 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x003bc;m rod-like shaped, whereas cells treated with 120 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of prodigiosin were double the size, measured on average 3.6 &#x000b1; 0.4 &#x003bc;m in length. Prodigiosin treated cells did not multiply; there were no changes in CFU counts after the treatment. This suggests that cells increase their biomass, but were not able to divide after prodigiosin treatment. Cell elongation is typical for cells in which SOS response has been induced. SOS induction is linked to significant DNA damage [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is generally accepted that in eukaryotic cells prodigiosin causes DNA cleavage and fragmentation in addition to cell acidification, cell cycle arrest, activation of caspase activity, and interference with signal transduction pathways [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. There are, however, no reports of corresponding DNA cleavage or fragmentation induced by prodigiosin in bacterial cells. To check if prodigiosin can cause DNA damage in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, chromosomal DNA was isolated and treated with prodigiosin. Irrespective of the pigment concentration no DNA fragmentation was observed. In SOS induced cells SulA inhibits FtsZ ring formation and prevents cell division leading to cell elongation [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

For example, combination of antimicrobial agents due to synergistic effect is often applied in microbial growth inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To check how prodigiosin in a combination with several known antibiotics affects survival of bacteria, an assay described by D&#x004e7;rr <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] has been used. As prodigiosin interferes with protein and nucleic acid synthesis, as well as it has an effect on the outer cell membrane leakage, four antibiotics were used with different targets: erythromycin and kanamycin as inhibitors of protein synthesis, ampicillin as inhibitor of cell wall synthesis, and phleomycin as DNA damaging agent. As given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162412.g005">Fig 5</xref>, pre-treatment with prodigiosin significantly affected survival during the antibiotic treatment. Ampicillin affected the viability of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to the highest degree and merly 0.01% survival rate was detected, when cells were treated with ampicillin alone. Prodigiosin pre-treatment surprisingly significantly increased the survival rate approximately 3-fold (p = 0.002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162412.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). When cells were exposed to erythromycin, the survival rate was approximately 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162412.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), but increased significantly to 75% (p-value 0.04), if cells were pre-treated with prodigiosin prior to erythromycin addition. A similar effect was observed in kanamycin treatment, also an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Only approximately 0.15% of cells survived the kanamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162412.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), however, an approximately 10-fold greater survival was observed in prodigiosin pre-treated cells (p-value 0.006). The obtained results are surprising and indicate that prodigiosin interferes with selected antibiotics, which inhibit protein and cell wall synthesis. Since prodigiosin may adsorb to proteins [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], it is feasible that prodigiosin could be present on ribosomes, where it may interfere with the action of ribosomal antibiotics. On the other hand, prodigiosin intercalates in the membrane and may interfere with antibiotics that inhibit cell wall biosynthesis. As antibiotics need active cells for the maximum effect, the shut down of cell activity by prodigiosin pre-treatment may have inadvertently protected cells from the action of antibiotics.

For a small molecule that is foreign to the organisms such as prodigiosin and is not actively metabolised in the cell, it is not unusual to have interactions with several different molecules [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Due to its physico-chemical nature, prodigiosin may be found in different cell compartments and interfere non-specifically with diverse cellular processes. As microbiologists we are all too often focused on very specific interactions based on proteins that require high fidelity in order to proceed. However, from a bacterial point of view a potent antimicrobial molecule could either be very specific or broad spectrum low toxic molecule that obstructs several cellular processes, thereby reducing the overall fitness of the adversary. Interestingly, depending on the context, prodigiosin appears to posses both features. As we have shown in our previous paper, prodigiosin in low concentrations specifically activates autolysins that in less than an hour after application completely auto-destroy <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0162412.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The same molecule, however, has a completely different mode of action in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells, where it attacks several cell targets, arrest overall growth, but enables the cell an escape if diluted. In this respect, prodigiosin epitomize all the beauty and complexity of small molecules interacting with the biological macromolecules to which they can diffuse to and interact with. The biology of small molecules is in the age of molecular biology, which almost exclusively focuses on macromolecules, seriously underrepresented. It is for this reason that classical physiological studies have merit in microbiology and should be fostered as we now have tools to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results presented in this work demonstrate that prodigiosin acts as a bacteriostatic agent on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and influences several physiological processes or behaviours. Cytoplasmic membranes and chromosomal DNA remained largely unaffected by prodigiosin treatment. The outer membrane becomes leaky. Growth, cell division, protein and RNA synthesis, as well as the overall metabolic activity, were severely impaired after prodigiosin treatment in particular above MIC values. Prodigiosin&#x000b4;s bacteriostatic activity can be reverted if prodigiosin is diluted when <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells resume growth. Unexpectedly, pre-treatment with prodigiosin improves survival of antibiotic treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Matej Butala for providing pSC101 plasmid and for his constructive comments and helpful suggestions regarding SOS induction.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0162412.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Szomolay</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Klapper</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dockey</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Adaptive responses to antimicrobial agents in biofilms</article-title>. <source>Environ Microbiol</source>. <year>2005</year>; <volume>7</volume>: <fpage>1186</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>1191</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00797.x</pub-id>
