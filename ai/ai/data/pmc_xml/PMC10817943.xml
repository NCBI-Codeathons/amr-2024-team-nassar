TB remains an enormous global health burden, causing an estimated 1.5 million deaths and 10 million new cases in 2020. TB was the leading cause of death in all infectious diseases until the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Additionally, the growing percentage of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB is a daunting obstacle to global TB treatment and prevention efforts. Since MDR TB is resistant to at least the two most potent TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampin, patients need new treatment options<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Consequently, new drugs addressing novel targets in <italic>Mtb</italic> are increasingly desired.</p><p id="Par4">Griselimycins (GMs) are such promising anti-TB antibiotics that bind and inhibit the mycobacterial DNA polymerase III sliding clamp (DnaN). This unique target makes GM distinct from other antibiotics to evade common TB drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The unusual nonproteogenic amino acid (2&#x02009;<italic>S</italic>,4&#x02009;<italic>R</italic>)&#x02212;4-methylproline ((2&#x02009;<italic>S</italic>,4&#x02009;<italic>R</italic>)&#x02212;4-MePro) acts as an essential building block occurring twice in GM and thrice in methylgriselimycin (MGM). Oxidation of the metabolically unstable Pro8 residue initiates GM degradation. The significantly improved metabolic stability of GM derivatives with substituent groups at Pro8, such as the natural MGM with (2&#x02009;<italic>S</italic>,4&#x02009;<italic>R</italic>)&#x02212;4-MePro, has corroborated this finding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. More importantly, GM congeners with different 4-alkyl groups show improved activity against <italic>Mtb</italic> which might be attributed to their enhanced lipophilicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In our previous study, the Fe(II)/&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate (&#x003b1;-KG)-dependent dioxygenase GriE was proven to initiate the biosynthesis of (2&#x02009;<italic>S</italic>,4&#x02009;<italic>R</italic>)&#x02212;4-MePro by hydroxylating <sc>l</sc>-leucine to form (2&#x02009;<italic>S</italic>,4&#x02009;<italic>R</italic>)&#x02212;5-hydroxyleucine. The zinc-dependent dehydrogenase GriF then converts (2&#x02009;<italic>S</italic>,4&#x02009;<italic>R</italic>)&#x02212;5-hydroxyleucine to (2&#x02009;<italic>S</italic>,4&#x02009;<italic>R</italic>)&#x02212;4-methylglutamate-5-semialdehyde. The resulting semialdehyde will be turned to (2&#x02009;<italic>S</italic>,4&#x02009;<italic>R</italic>)&#x02212;4-MePro by a spontaneous cyclization and a final reduction by the pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase ProC or GriH (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

We discover the previously unknown mycoplanecin (MP) biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and isolate several MP derivatives that indeed exhibited significantly improved pharmaceutical properties compared to GM.

This mining strategy was effective as it found the BGCs known to produce compounds containing 4-MePro, such as GM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). Among the unknown hits which are mainly nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or NRPS hybrid BGCs, one hit similar to the GM pathway drew our attention because it exhibited significant differences. However, only a partial BGC could be recovered due to the low genome sequence quality.

Notwithstanding the structural similarity to GM, MPs possess unique characteristics, including the exceptional N-terminal &#x003b1;-keto butyric moiety, as well as the other two 4-alkylprolines: 4-EtPro and 4-propylproline (4-PrPro), homoleucine (5-Methyl-norleucine), and N-methyl-homonorleucine (N-methylheptanoic acid) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>MP biosynthetic gene cluster and proposed biosynthetic pathway.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The gene organization and comparison of GM and MP biosynthetic gene clusters. <bold>b</bold> The MP biosynthetic pathway proposal.

The putative MP BGC comprises 15 genes divided into three hypothetical operons that encode NRPSs, precursor biosynthetic enzymes, and a self-resistance protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We found a DnaN-encoding gene <italic>mypR</italic> nearby transposase genes, which was also observed for <italic>griR</italic> in the GM pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, <italic>mypR</italic> is found to be the second DnaN gene in the genome of strain ATCC33919, implying that MPs are potential DnaN inhibitors, and <italic>mypR</italic> confers self-resistance against MPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The majority of genes are clustered in one operon, which encodes NRPSs MypABC, the MbtH protein MypD, redox enzymes MypP (P450), MypE (hydroxylase), and MypF (dehydrogenase), the thioesterase MypG, the discrete ACP MypI, and the ketosynthase MypJ, as well as a radical SAM enzyme MypH. Inconsistencies in the assembly of the NRPS gene <italic>mypA</italic> caused by repetitive sequences were solved by comprehensive PCR amplification and restriction digestion analysis (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The three gene operon comprising <italic>mypKLM</italic> is located upstream adjacent to the primary operon and oriented in opposite direction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). MypK and MypL show sequence similarity to enzymes involved in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis. MypM is a SAM synthetase probably involved in regenerating the cofactor required by MypH.</p><p id="Par8">MypA, MypB, and MypC comprise six, three, and one single NRPS module, respectively. The substrate specificity prediction of adenylation (A) domains correctly suggested the incorporation of Thr3, Leu4, Pro8, Leu9, and Gly10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The four N-methyltransferase (MT) domains align with the N-methylation of Val1, Thr3, Val7, and Leu9 in MPs. However, modules 1 and 7 were inappropriately predicted to activate Thr instead of Val. Intriguingly, several nonproteogenic amino acid building blocks were found in the biosynthesis of MPs. A6 is predicted to activate ornithine, but <sc>l</sc>-homoleucine was found incorporated in MPs in this position. The A9 domain has a promiscuous substrate tolerance since <sc>l</sc>-N-methyl-homonorleucine and <sc>l</sc>-N-Methyl-Leu are present in different MPs at this position. The substrate specificity of A2, A5, and A8 was predicted as proline, indicating that the current bioinformatic analysis could not discriminate proline from different alkyl-prolines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The substrate specificity of A2 is flexible as three different 4-alkylproline residues are incorporated in different MP derivatives. However, it is also possible that different 4-alkylproline residues are formed by post-modifications of 4-MePro in MP B (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). It is noteworthy that uncommon genes responsible for lipopeptide chain initiation are found in the MP pathway, partially similar to the proposed pathway for calcium-dependent antibiotics (CDAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Here, it is hypothesized that the holo-MypI (ACP) is either malonylated by the malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT) FabD or functions as a self-priming ACP that widely exists in fatty acid biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the KAS III-like enzyme MypJ extends the acyl chain by a molecule of acetyl-CoA to form the acetoacetyl-<italic>S</italic>-ACP species, which is probably reduced to butyryl-<italic>S</italic>-MypI by reductases from the type II fatty acid biosynthesis. A P450-dependent oxidase encoding gene <italic>mypP</italic> is assumed to be responsible for the cryptic &#x003b1;-keto group formation, albeit the mechanism and oxidation timing are still unexplored (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary discussion</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Isolation and structure elucidation of MPs with unusual building blocks</title><p id="Par9">Mycoplanecins were first investigated four decades ago due to their activity against Mycobacteria while possessing low cytotoxicity, but no subsequent studies are known from the literature.

Furthermore, the spectral data reveal that MP E contains the same 4-propylproline moiety as described in MP D, which is substituted by 4-methylproline in MP A and 4-ethylproline in MP B. N-methylleucine found in MP A, B and D is replaced by the rare N-methylheptanoic acid building block in MP E.

Besides this, the chemical shifts of the remaining structure of MP D and MP E exhibit a deviation of less than 0.12 ppm for &#x003b4;(<sup>1</sup>H) and 2.5 ppm for &#x003b4;(<sup>13</sup>C) (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary NMR Data</xref>).

Interestingly, GM manifests a slightly stronger DnaN binding affinity than the MPs but is less active than MPs against mycobacteria. This intriguing phenomenon is unresolved but is likely a result of MPs&#x02019; improved physicochemical properties including increased lipophilicity, which is important for TB activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Crystal structure of DnaN in complex with MP A</title><p id="Par13">Although the co-crystal of msDnaN and MP A could not be obtained after intensive attempts, DnaN of <italic>E. coli</italic> (ecDnaN) was overproduced in <italic>E. coli</italic> and co-crystallized with MP A, GM and cyclohexyl-GM (CGM). Despite sharing only 29 % sequence identity with msDnaN, the binding pocket of ecDNA shows a sufficient degree of conservation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The crystal structures were solved at resolutions of 2.12&#x02009;&#x000c5; (MP A), 1.65&#x02009;&#x000c5; (GM) and 1.50&#x02009;&#x000c5; (CGM) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). MP A was found to bind in the same mode to ecDnaN as GM or CGM. The binding pocket can be divided into a larger (subsite 1) and a smaller cavity (subsite 2) and as has been shown previously for GM and mycobacterial DnaN, all compounds occupy both subsites of the binding pocket. All three substances form hydrogen bonds to only 2 &#x02013; 3 protein residues, but the additional oxygen in the N-terminal &#x003b1;-keto butyrate residue of MP A provides a second hydrogen bond acceptor for Arg365 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>), which is also conserved in mycobacterial DnaN. The compounds bind mainly via van der Waals interactions with interfaces ranging from 550 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for GM to 590 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for CGM to 600 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for MP A. Compared to available structures of uncomplexed DnaN, only a few residues undergo significant conformational changes upon binding of the compounds - most notably Met362, which has been described to function as a gate between the subsites (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The linear, N-terminal part of the ligands in subsite 2 superimposes almost perfectly, while MP A seems to be tilted slightly (approximately 7-10 &#x000b0; compared to GM/CGM) away from the protein in the region around Pro8. This tilting can be attributed to the longer 5-methyl-l-norleucine residue of MP A at position 6, whereas leucine is present at the same position in GM and CGM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). The comparison with the previously published mycobacterial GM/DnaN complexes shows that whereas the N-terminal parts of the ligands in subsite 2 superimpose very well, there is higher variance on the opposite side of the molecules around Pro8 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). In the complex with msDnaN, GM adopts a conformation very similar to that of MP A in the ecDnaN complex, although GM lacks the 5-methyl-l-norleucine at position 6 and the residues lining the protein pocket around this position are conserved between mycobacteria and <italic>E. coli</italic>. In complex with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> DnaN, the tilt of GM away from the protein is less pronounced, instead the macrocycle seems to be tilted approximately 7&#x000b0; towards positon 7 in comparison to the msDnaN complex. Although differences in crystal packing make a direct comparison of the binding strength difficult, the linear part of the ligands (1-3) and the residues adjacent to the bifurcation (4-5, 10) seem to be bound tighter/show less flexibility than the opposing residues (6-9) in all structures of DnaN/GM complexes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Binding of MP A to ecDnaN.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Superimposition of the ecDnaN co-crystal structures containing MP A (8CIZ, dark/light green for the two entities in the asymmetric unit), GM (8CIX, orange), and CGM (8CIY, violet).

We proposed the biosynthesis of the homo-amino acid residues in MPs as biosynthetically sharing an analogous process to leucine biosynthesis, as previously also suggested for a few other homo-amino acids. Two homologous genes of leucine biosynthesis were identified within the MP BGC. <italic>mypK</italic> encodes a 2-isopropylmalate synthase-like enzyme that likely catalyzes the condensation of different six-carbon &#x003b1;-keto acids, including 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (<bold>1</bold>), 2-oxohexanoate (<bold>2</bold>), and 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (<bold>3</bold>) with acetyl-CoA.

A feeding study with <sc>l</sc>-Methionine-(<italic>methyl</italic>-<sup>13</sup>C) suggested the extra carbons of 4-EtPro and 4-PrPro over 4-MePro in MPs likely to come from radical SAM methylation by MypH.

The analogous chemical structures of MPs and GMs align with their identical molecular target site within DnaN. In comparison to GM and CGM, the higher potency of MP A might be attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the substance and the larger van der Waals interface with DnaN. The 5-methyl-<sc>l</sc>-norleucine at position 6 might also play a role by pushing the generally less-tight bound region around Pro8 out of the binding pocket but stabilizing the tighter interaction around the ligand&#x02019;s bifurcation. The co-crystal structure of ecDnaN bound with MP A and the nanomolar binding affinity of MPs to msDnaN validates DnaN as the molecular target. The binding mode is similar to GM and CGM, albeit MPs showed significantly stronger anti-Mtb bioactivity. This finding is of great importance as GM development towards a TB drug was stopped due to unwanted but target-independent side effects (unpublished results). As mycoplanecins show significantly lower MICs they might be useful to overcome this limitation as the potential therapeutic window over the side effect is significantly improved.</p><p id="Par26">TB is still one of the leading public health threats, even during the global COVID-19 pandemic.
