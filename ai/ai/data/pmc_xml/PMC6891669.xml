Introduction</title><p>Trichothecenes are a group of mycotoxins produced by several filamentous fungi including <italic>Fusarium</italic>. They have a trichothecene skeleton of 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene in common, but their side chain modification greatly varies, resulting in a large difference in their toxicity [<xref rid="B1-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They exert toxicity mainly through the inhibition of protein synthesis in eukaryotes [<xref rid="B3-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some fusaria are notorious fungi, known to cause <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight in important crops.</p><p>Based on the biosynthetic pathways, trichothecenes are largely divided into two groups: t-type trichothecenes, with a modifying group at C-3 position, and d-type trichothecenes, without a modifying group [<xref rid="B4-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the early biosynthetic pathway of trichothecenes, trichodiene is first synthesized through the cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate by Tri5p [<xref rid="B6-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Trichodiene is then oxygenated to isotrichotriol, followed by spontaneous cyclization to produce the following t-type trichothecenes: <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> produces deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol, and their acetylated forms; <italic>Fusarium sporotrichioides</italic> produces T-2 toxin, neosalaniol, and diacetoxyscirpenol. On the other hand, in non-fusaria, including <italic>Myrothecium</italic>, <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, <italic>Trichothecium, Stachybotrys,</italic> and <italic>Spicellum</italic> [<xref rid="B7-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], trichodiene is oxygenated to isotrichodiol followed by spontaneous cyclization to produce d-type trichothecenes. There is another classification method of dividing trichothecenes into four types (A&#x02013;D) based on their chemical structures [<xref rid="B8-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Type B group is distinguished from type A group by the presence of a ketone at C-8, and either type is synthesized by both t-type and d-type trichothecene producers. Type C group, which contains a 7,8-epoxide, and type D group, which contains a macrocyclic ring between C-4 and C-15, are exclusively produced by d-type trichothecene producers.</p><p>In fusaria, the first trichothecene produced is isotrichodermol (ITDol), which is immediately acetylated at the C-3 position by 3-<italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase, Tri101p, into isotrichodermin (ITD) [<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been reported that a 3-acetylated trichothecene is generally less toxic than its corresponding 3-hydroxy form [<xref rid="B10-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hence, it was suggested that Tri101p confers self-resistance to trichothecene produced in fusaria; indeed, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> transformed with the <italic>Tri101</italic> gene has been found to be more resistant to T-2 toxin than the wild type (WT) [<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. So far, <italic>Tri101</italic> has been isolated from fusaria, including <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic>, and their enzyme kinetics have been evaluated extensively [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Trichothecenes are phytotoxins and may play a role as a virulence factor that contributes toxin producers to infect host plants [<xref rid="B15-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, in order to combat <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight, researchers have made extensive efforts to examine the effect of the transgenic expression of <italic>Tri101</italic> on trichothecene resistance and <italic>Fusarium</italic> infection in host cereals [<xref rid="B18-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These studies have unequivocally proved that transgenic tobacco and rice showed improved trichothecene resistance [<xref rid="B19-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In wheat, moderate tolerance to <italic>Fusarium</italic> infection was observed in a field trial [<xref rid="B21-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the contrary, in barley, deoxynivalenol may not be a virulence factor, and no effect on infection was observed in a field trial [<xref rid="B22-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, the gene manipulation of <italic>Tri101</italic> has been effective to confer tolerance to trichothecenes in some host plants, although the effect might be limited.</p><p>In contrast to the case with microbes and plants, the effects of trichothecene acetylation at the C-3 position and the transfection of <italic>Tri101</italic> into cultured mammalian cells are complicated to understand. Although there is approximately a 100-fold difference in terms of the in vitro inhibition of protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocytes between 3-acetylated trichothecenes and their corresponding 3-hydroxy forms, this difference was reduced to tenfold in terms of the in vivo inhibition of glycoprotein synthesis in BGK-21 cells [<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although it has been reported that a 3-acetyl trichothecene has lower toxicity than its corresponding 3-hydroxy form [<xref rid="B2-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], there is a conflicting report of 3-acetyl T-2 toxin being as toxic as T-2 toxin in human cell cultures [<xref rid="B23-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and, so far, no reports have shown that improved resistance to trichothecenes is conferred by <italic>Tri101</italic> transfection in cultured mammalian cells. Moreover, it has been reported that the acetyl group at the C-3 position of trichothecene is easily removed in animal systems [<xref rid="B24-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this way, the toxicity of a C-3 acetyl trichothecene has tended to be inaccurately estimated by measuring the toxicity of a mixture of C-3 acetyl and C-3 hydroxy trichothecenes. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to maintain the 3-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl group attached to the trichothecene skeleton by the transgenic expression of <italic>Tri101</italic> in murine FM3A cells, resulting in a more accurate evaluation of the toxicity of 3-acetyl trichothecenes. We also examined whether <italic>Tri101</italic> transfection into mammalian cultured cells improves their resistance to 3-hydorxytrichothecenes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-toxins-11-00654"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-toxins-11-00654"><title>2.1. Deacetylation of 3-Acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) and ITD</title><p>Assuming that the acetyl group of 3-acetyltrichothecenes was cleaved to produce more-toxic 3-hydroxytrichothecenes in cytotoxicity and animal studies, we first verified the extent of the deacetylation of two trichothecenes, 3-ADON, which is an acetylated form of the most common trichothecene DON, and, ITD, the first acetylated trichothecene produced by Tri101p in trichothecene biosynthesis.</p><p>First, 3-ADON or ITD was added to H<sub>2</sub>O, 125 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.5), and RPMI medium (without any additive), and the solutions were incubated in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 48 h. Neither DON nor ITDol was detected in H<sub>2</sub>O containing its corresponding 3-acetyltrichothecene, but some deacetylated forms were detected in both the buffer and the RPMI medium after incubation (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-11-00654">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), which suggests that non-enzymatic deacetylation of these 3-acetylated trichothecenes occurred in them. Next, the actual culture medium for FM3A cells was examined. RPMI medium was supplemented with antibiotics, sodium pyruvate, &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, and deactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Considering the possibility that FBS contained contaminating esterases, we prepared the culture medium supplemented with non-boiled FBS (designated as N-medium) and boiled FBS (designated as B-medium). When 3-ADON or ITD was added to the media, the deacetylation rates of these trichothecenes were much higher in N-medium than B-medium, with ITD being deacetylated more efficiently than 3-ADON. While up to 96% of ITD was deacetylated to ITDol in the N-medium, only 4.6% of ITD was deacetylated in the B-medium. These results suggest that FBS contained broad-substrate-specificity esterases that could be deactivated by boiling, and ITD was more efficiently deacetylated than 3-ADON by these esterases.</p><p>FM3A cells were confirmed to grow in B-medium as normally as in N-medium; thus, the cells were incubated in B-medium containing 3-ADON or ITD in order to examine the stability of 3-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl group of these trichothecenes in a cell culture environment. As shown in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-11-00654">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, 4.9% and 10.3% of 3-ADON was deacetylated to DON in 3 mL of cell culture medium containing 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells and 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells, respectively, while 17.0% and 39.1% ITD was deacetylated to ITDol, respectively. These results suggest that FM3A cells themselves contained esterases acting on C-3 of the trichothecene skeleton.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxins-11-00654"><title>2.2. Transfection of FM3A Cells and Screening Cell Lines with High Expression of Tri101</title><p>First, we confirmed that the growth of FM3A WT cells was completely suppressed in the N-medium containing 30 &#x000b5;g/mL of blasticidin S and in the B-medium containing 0.1 &#x000b5;g/mL (0.40 &#x000b5;M) of ITDol. The growth of FM3A transfected with an empty vector was also completely suppressed in the B-medium containing 0.40 &#x000b5;M of ITDol. Thus, just after transfection of the vector carrying <italic>Tri101</italic>, the transformants were screened in N-medium with 60 &#x000b5;g/mL of blasticidin S and, subsequently, with increasing concentrations of the antibiotic (up to 250 &#x000b5;g/mL). Next, we transferred the screened cells into B-medium with 0.40 &#x000b5;M of ITDol, followed by B-medium with 0.80 &#x000b5;M of ITDol, in order to screen the transformants with a high Tri101p activity. Over 100 cell lines that survived the screening process were then cloned in B-medium containing 0.16 &#x000b5;M of ITDol by limiting dilution. Crude enzyme was prepared from each clone and the Tri101p activity toward ITDol or DON was initially evaluated by TLC, followed by HPLC. We selected one cell line, designated as G3, which showed the highest Tri101p activity. In the absence of the drugs, the growth rate of G3 was comparable to that of the WT cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxins-11-00654"><title>2.3. Acetylase and Deacetylase Activities of Crude Cell Extracts from WT and G3 Cells</title><p>Next, we measured the in vitro acetylase activities of WT and the transformant G3 cells by HPLC. We added 169 &#x000b5;M DON or 200 &#x000b5;M ITDol at a final concentration to the reaction mixture, in order to measure the approximate V<sub>max</sub>, as these concentrations were much higher than the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for DON and ITDol, 11.7 and 10.2 &#x000b5;M, respectively [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The crude enzymes from the WT cells showed no acetylase activities toward either substrate, with or without induction by dexamethasone (DEX; an inducer of transgene expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00654-f001">Figure 1</xref>, right). In contrast, the crude enzymes from the G3 cells showed acetylase activities toward both DON and ITDol. As expected, significantly higher acetylase activities were observed in the crude enzymes from G3 cells pretreated with DEX than in those without DEX (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This result is consistent with the previous observation that DEX resulted in a two- to fivefold increase in the levels of expression of a luciferase gene from the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR) promoter in FM3A cells [<xref rid="B25-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. All the crude enzyme prepared here showed deacetylase activities toward both 3-ADON and ITD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00654-f001">Figure 1</xref>, left).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-toxins-11-00654"><title>2.4. Acquired Trichothecene Resistance in the Cells Transfected with Tri101</title><p>After the WT and G3 cells were seeded in the B-medium, the vehicle or ITDol was added to the culture medium, and the cell numbers were counted on day 3, 5, or 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00654-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Both WT and G3 cells grew normally until day 3 in the medium containing the vehicle, after which they underwent apoptosis. In contrast, in B-medium containing 0.40 &#x000b5;M ITDol, almost all the WT cells underwent apoptosis by day 3, but G3 cells continued to grow until day 5, after which the cell numbers decreased. In B-medium containing 0.80 &#x000b5;M ITDol, the G3 cells slowly continued to grow until day 5&#x02013;7. In the medium containing a higher concentration of ITDol, even the G3 cells struggled to grow. Thus, it was concluded that G3 cells had acquired resistance to ITDol. This is the first study reporting that the transfection of <italic>Tri101</italic> into mammalian cells confers resistance to trichothecenes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-toxins-11-00654"><title>2.5. Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Each Trichothecene in WT and G3 Cells</title><p>We performed a water-soluble tetrazolium salts (WST) assay to evaluate the cytotoxicity of DON, 3-ADON, ITDol, and ITD more accurately, based on the assumption that the cytotoxicity of 3-acetyltrichothecenes had been overestimated in previous studies. First, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of ITDol and ITD in WT cells were determined using N-medium or B-medium (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-11-00654">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The observed IC<sub>50</sub> values of ITDol and ITD were close when WT cells were incubated in N-medium (0.19 &#x000b1; 0.01 and 0.26 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x000b5;M, respectively), however, a large difference was evident when assayed in B-medium (0.20 &#x000b1; 0.01 and 2.14 &#x000b1; 0.06 &#x000b5;M, respectively). The higher sensitivity of cultured mammalian cells to ITD in N-medium seems to be attributed to the contaminating esterases that act on ITD (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-11-00654">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), resulting in the formation of much more toxic ITDol. This observation strongly suggests that without an elaboration to keep the 3-acetyl group attached to the ITDol ring, the toxicity of 3-acetyltrichothecene tends to be overestimated. Although the apparent IC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.14 &#x000b5;M observed for ITD in B-medium could be closer to the actual IC<sub>50</sub> value of intact ITD, this value may in fact be lower than the actual value, as an acetyl group may not remain attached to the C-3 position of the trichothecene skeleton due to the presence of intrinsic esterases hydrolyzing the 3-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl group in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00654-f001">Figure 1</xref>, chemical reactions). Thus, we attempted to measure the concentration of ITDol possibly produced from ITD in the cell culture medium in this assay; however, ITDol was not detected in our HPLC analysis (limit of detection; 1.2 &#x000b5;M). As the IC<sub>50</sub> value of FM3A cells against ITDol was as low as 0.22 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00654-f003">Figure 3</xref>), ITDol levels below the detection limit possibly affected cell growth. The higher toxicity of ITD may be explained by the C-3 deacetylation of ITD during the assay.</p><p>Next, in order to evaluate cytotoxicity of 3-ADON and ITD more accurately, we determined their IC<sub>50</sub> values using G3 cells expressing <italic>Tri101</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00654-f003">Figure 3</xref>A shows the dose&#x02013;response cytotoxicity curves of DON and 3-ADON using WT and G3 cells. In WT cells, the difference in the IC<sub>50</sub> values between DON and 3-ADON was around 12-fold. In G3 cells, all the IC<sub>50</sub> values were increased significantly compared to their corresponding values in WT cells. The IC<sub>50</sub> value in G3 cells pretreated with DEX was slightly higher than that without DEX, and the values were significantly different in DON, but not in 3-ADON. No significant difference was observed in the IC<sub>50</sub> value of these trichothecenes in WT cells with and without DEX pretreatment. These results indicate that the transformant G3 cells were more resistant to both DON and 3-ADON than WT cells due to the expression of <italic>Tri101</italic> in G3 cells. As it is likely that the more accurate IC<sub>50</sub> of 3-ADON was that of G3 cells treated with DEX (11.68 &#x000b5;M), this value was significantly higher than that of WT cells (7.09 &#x000b5;M without DEX, 6.45 &#x000b5;M with DEX) suggesting that cytotoxicity of 3-ADON might be overestimated in previous studies. Here, the IC<sub>50</sub> of 3-ADON was at least 21-fold higher than that of DON (0.56 &#x000b5;M) obtained in WT.</p><p>The effect of the transgenic expression of <italic>Tri101</italic> in G3 was more obvious in the IC<sub>50</sub> values of ITDol and ITD than in those of DON and 3-ADON. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00654-f003">Figure 3</xref>B presents the result of the WST assay of ITDol and ITD in WT and G3 cells. In WT cells, the difference of the IC<sub>50</sub> values between ITDol and ITD was 13&#x02013;16 fold. In G3 cells, without DEX induction, the IC<sub>50</sub> values of ITDol and ITD were almost doubled compared to those in the WT cells. Moreover, with DEX induction, the IC<sub>50</sub> values of ITDol and ITD were three- to fourfold compared with those in the WT cells. This indicates that DEX induced <italic>Tri101</italic> expression, which resulted in the increased acetylation of ITDol to ITD. Thus, the IC<sub>50</sub> values of both ITDol and ITD were almost doubled in G3 cells treated with DEX compared to those without DEX, and the values were significantly higher in both ITDol and ITD by DEX pretreatment. In WT cells, no significant increase was observed in the IC<sub>50</sub> value of these trichothecenes by DEX pretreatment. Similar to DON and 3-ADON, a more accurate IC<sub>50</sub> of ITD was likely to be that of G3 cells treated with DEX (9.58 &#x000b5;M), thus, this value was significantly higher than that of WT cells (2.78 &#x000b5;M without DEX, 3.59 &#x000b5;M with DEX), suggesting that cytotoxicity of ITD in previous studies might be overestimated. It represented an at least 44-fold increase of IC<sub>50</sub> value of ITD (9.58 &#x000b5;M), which is supposedly to be more accurate, compared to that of ITDol obtained in WT (0.21&#x02013;0.22 &#x000b5;M).</p><p>In this study, the level of <italic>Tri101</italic> expression was found to affect the IC<sub>50</sub> values of trichothecenes in mammalian transformants. However, the <italic>Tri101</italic> expression level may not be sufficient to fully compete with the C-3 deacetylation activity of strong endogenous esterases. Nevertheless, this study clearly showed that the 3-acetyl group of 3-<italic>O</italic>-acetyltrichothecenes could be hydrolyzed enzymatically in mammalian cells and that their cytotoxicities were overestimated in other studies. The IC<sub>50</sub> of trichothecenes were much lower than the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of Tri101p against them, making it difficult to completely acetylate the C-3 of the trichothecenes added to the culture.</p><p>This is the first report to unambiguously demonstrate the acquired trichothecene resistance of cultured mammalian cells transformed with <italic>Tri101</italic>. These results strongly support the theory that C-3 acetylation blocks the toxicity of t-type trichothecenes, which serves as a self-defense mechanism of the producing organisms [<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00654" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast to fungi and plants, the strong C-3 deacetylase activity of mammalian cells activates 3-acetyltrichothecenes, the toxicity of which has been overestimated in previous studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-toxins-11-00654"><title>3.
