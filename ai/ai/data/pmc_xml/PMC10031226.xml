Herein, we investigated the enzymology of a DHFR-like protein SacH in safracin (SAC) biosynthesis, which reductively inactivates hemiaminal pharmacophore-containing biosynthetic intermediates and antibiotics for self-resistance. Furthermore, based on the crystal structure of SacH&#x02212;NADPH&#x02212;SAC-A ternary complexes and mutagenesis, we proposed a catalytic mechanism that is distinct from the previously characterized short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases-mediated inactivation of hemiaminal pharmacophore. These findings expand the functions of DHFR family proteins, reveal that the common reaction can be catalyzed by distinct family of enzymes, and imply the possibility for the discovery of novel antibiotics with hemiaminal pharmacophore.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p>A dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-like protein SacH in safracin (SAC) biosynthesis was found to reductively inactivates hemiaminal pharmacophore-containing antibiotics for self-resistance, expanding the functions of DHFR family proteins.<fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="ga1"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Catalytic mechanism</kwd><kwd>Crystal structure</kwd><kwd>Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)</kwd><kwd>Hemiaminal pharmacophore</kwd><kwd>SacH</kwd><kwd>Safracin biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>Self-resistance</kwd><kwd>Tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) alkaloids</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) catalyzes the reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF) to 5,6,7,8,-tetrahydrofolate (THF) with NADPH as a cofactor, which plays an essential role in cellular biochemistry.

Adjacent to NADPH, SAC-A binds to key residues in the active site of SacH: SAC-A forms several hydrogen bonds with Ala9, Glu27, Tyr38 and Tyr68; and hydrophobic interactions with Leu23, Leu26, Trp57 and Thr136 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>A and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information Fig.&#x000a0;S10</xref>). Notably, the Tyr38 and Tyr68 not only form hydrogen bonds with SAC-A, but also provide steric hindrance pushing SAC-A towards NADPH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>A). Detailed analysis between the positions of NADPH and SAC-A clearly shows that the C4-pro-<italic>R</italic> hydrogen of NADPH is close to the C21 of SAC-A, and takes the similar position as the leaving C21-hydroxy group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>B), which is consistent with [4-<sup>2</sup>H]-NADPH assay results and the stereoselective reduction by SacH.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Proposed mechanism for the reduction of hemiaminal pharmacophore catalyzed by SacH</title><p id="p0055">To confirm the key roles of active site residues, we carried out site-mutagenesis experiments. As expected, single mutation to alanine for the residues related to SAC-A binding caused decreased or no activities, in which T136A mutant completely lost the activity (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information Fig.&#x000a0;S11</xref>). Double mutants E27A/Y38A, E27A/Y68A, and Y38A/Y68A also completely abolished the activity. Interestingly, the T136V and T136L mutants can restore the activity, while T136S not, suggesting that Thr136 mainly provides steric hindrance to stabilize the substrate close to NADPH, instead of by the hydrogen bond. Other mutants including T136F, T136D, and T136W abolished the activity, suggesting that these longer or larger residues are not allowed for a suitable substrate binding. It has been proved that the hydroxy group in THIQ antibiotics can spontaneously leave in acidic solution, to form the electrophilic iminium species<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>, whose binding style may resemble that of SAC-A in the active site. Thus, these combined hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the active site confine SAC-A (or substrate) in a specific conformation that only allow the hydride from NADPH attacks C21 in a stereoselective way (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>).<fig id="fig5"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>The active site of SacH&#x02212;NADPH&#x02212;SAC-A and enzymatic mechanism.

The substrate promiscuity of SacH is largely attributed to its large substrate binding pocket (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A), which can allow the accommodation of THIQs with different size and skeleton modifications, even for the long-chain fatty acyl group-containing <bold>11</bold> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>B).<fig id="fig6"><label>Figure&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Comparison of the binding modes of SacH with different THIQs.

The neighbor-joining unrooted phylogenetic tree including SacH, its homologs mentioned above, characterized DHFRs, bifunctional deaminase-reductase RibDs (structural homolog of DHFR), and the reductase domain of the RibDs, has revealed that SacH and its homologs are in the new branch and more related to the RibDs (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information Fig.&#x000a0;S13</xref>).

Sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information Fig.&#x000a0;S19</xref>) indicated that SacH homologs are widely existed in the phylum proteobacteria and actinobacteria, which indicates the extensive presence of reductive detoxification toward hemiaminal pharmacophore.
