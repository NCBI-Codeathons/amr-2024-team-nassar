However, <italic>Streptomyces sahachiroi</italic>, the strain that produces AZB, seems almost impervious to this danger because of its diverse and distinctive self-protection machineries.

AziN expression conferred AZB resistance on native and heterologous host strains. The specific binding reaction between AziN and AZB was also verified in accordance with its homology to drug binding proteins, but no drug sequestering and deactivating effects could be detected. Intriguingly, due to the high affinity with the drug, AziN was discovered to exhibit specific recognition and binding capacity with AZB-mediated ICL structures, further inducing DNA strand breakage. Subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> assays demonstrated the structure-specific endonuclease activity of AziN, which cuts both damaged strands at specific sites around AZB-ICLs. Unravelling the nuclease activity of AziN provides a good entrance point to illuminate the complex mechanisms of AZB-ICL repair.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31870089</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hubei Province of China</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2018CFA069</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100012226</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2662018PY053</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly cytotoxic lesions induced by endogenous and environmental genotoxic agents that covalently tether two bases on opposite strands of the DNA double helix (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This kind of lesion seriously impairs DNA replication and transcription by blocking DNA strand separation, resulting in chromosomal mutations, rearrangements, instability, and even cell death (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Rapidly dividing cells, such as tumour cells, are hypersensitive to ICL damage, which has led to the extensive clinical application of many well-known ICL inducers in cancer treatment (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Unlike the repair of simple DNA damage, a large number of proteins responsible for multiple specialized DNA repair mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair (NER), homologous recombination, translesion synthesis, mismatch repair and base excision repair (BER), can all be recruited to repair ICLs (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Different ICL repair proteins are involved depending on the structure of the ICL, the cell cycle phase and the biological species. New factors implicated in ICL repair continued to be discovered with sustained advances in the research of these complex mechanisms in recent years.</p><p>ICLs are serious challenges to the ability of all living cells to maintain the chemical integrity of their genome. However, ICL agent-producing microorganisms can easily mitigate the danger by employing diverse self-protection machineries. For instance, the clinical anticancer drug mitomycin C (MMC) producer, <italic>Streptomyces lavendulae</italic>, is known to be protected by the encoded products of three genes, <italic>mcr</italic>A, <italic>mrd</italic>&#x000a0;and <italic>mct</italic>, via reoxidation of the active reduced MMC, retention/sequestration of the native prodrug, and drug efflux, respectively (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>). The drug binding protein BlmA and the N-acetyltransferase BlmB confer resistance to bleomycin in <italic>Streptomyces verticillus</italic>, the bleomycin-producing strain, through drug sequestration and inactivation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In addition to the proteins acting on drugs, DNA repair enzymes, such as the UvrA-like proteins (SgcB2 for C-1027 resistance, DrrC for daunorubicin resistance, and CmrX for chromomycin resistance) and the DNA glycosylase homologue (YtKR2 for yatakemycin resistance) derived from the biosynthetic gene clusters of DNA-targeting drugs, have been recently reported to be implicated in the drug self-resistance of the producing strains (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;15</xref>).</p><p>Azinomycin B (AZB), a highly genotoxic agent with two reactive groups, which includes an active epoxide moiety and an unusual aziridine ring (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;20</xref>), has prominent <italic>in vivo</italic> antitumor activity and <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity comparable to that of MMC (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Its excellent biological activity appears to be derived from the formation of covalent ICLs in the major groove between guanine and purine residues in the duplex DNA sequence 5&#x02032;-d(GNPy)-3&#x02032; via tandem electrophilic attacks of C10 in the aziridine ring and C21 in the epoxide moiety (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Our previous research identified a new type of DNA glycosylase, Orf1, also known as Azi36 and AlkZ, which unhooks AZB-ICL by enzymatic cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond at the crosslinking site and thus confers self-resistance on the AZB producer, <italic>Streptomyces sahachiroi</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Herein, we report another new structure-specific nucleoside cleavage enzyme identified from the AZB self-resistance system, which is a product encoded by <italic>orf3</italic>/<italic>azi38</italic> (renamed <italic>aziN</italic>, GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MK453398">MK453398</ext-link>) located near the <italic>orf1</italic>/<italic>alkZ</italic> gene. Initially, AziN was considered to be involved in self-resistance by drug sequestration. However, upon further analysis, it was demonstrated to specifically recognize the AZB-ICLs by drug binding and unhook them via cleaving the phosphodiester bonds on at least one side of the lesion. The cleavage mode of this newly discovered endonuclease was later determined by a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>

The well-known proteins of this superfamily include type I extradiol dioxygenase, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, glyoxalase I and a group of antibiotic resistance proteins (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The bleomycin-binding protein (BlmT) encoded by the transposon Tn5 and the mitomycin-binding protein (MRD) derived from the MMC biosynthetic gene cluster are typical representatives of these antibiotic resistance determinants, conferring resistance by drug sequestration (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Another kind of antibiotic resistance protein in this superfamily, the fosfomycin resistance protein encoded by the transposon Tn 2921, renders fosfomycin inactive to confer fosfomycin resistance (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Although AziN shares low amino acid sequence identity (23&#x02212;17%) and similarity (38&#x02212;32%) with these antibiotic resistance proteins, its capacity to bind and inactivate drugs has been investigated under limited information acquired from bioinformatics analyses. An equilibrium fluorescence titration assay was used to detect the binding affinity between AziN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) and putative ligands, including different ICL agents. After excitation at 295 nm, the maximum fluorescence emission of the purified protein was observed at 325 nm. The intrinsic fluorescence of AziN steadily decreased as the concentration of AZB increased, whereas the other ICL agent MMC did not alter the protein fluorescence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A and E</xref>).

After incubation with or without AZB at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h, AziN was subsequently added to the DNA solution at 30&#x000b0;C for 20 min of incubation. With increasing concentrations of AziN, a retardation band of the protein-DNA complex started to appear gradually in ICL DNA samples, while no change was observed in native DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The drug was supposed to mediate the binding of AziN to AZB&#x02013;ICL DNA.

Once the crosslinking was removed, the DNA configuration resumed, as did the speed of DNA migration (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). After treatment with AziN, a new migration band of decrosslinked DNA appeared between ICL DNA and ocDNA (open circular DNA), and its intensity increased with the protein concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3), indicating the ability of AziN to repair ICL DNA. Moreover, the new shift band exhibited different mobility from the product repaired by the DNA glycosylase Orf1/AlkZ (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) (lane 6), implying distinct incision modes between the two proteins.

Since the conformation change in linear DNA is not obvious, alkali denaturation was employed to distinguish between crosslinked and uncrosslinked DNA prior to agarose gel analysis. The basic double helix structure of repaired ICL DNA was preserved due to the base-pairing hydrogen bonds before alkali denaturation (lane 4). When the base pairing of repaired ICL DNA was disrupted via alkali denaturation, a large amount of low-molecular weight DNA appeared (lane 10), which verified the incision of AziN at the phosphodiester backbone of ICL DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p><p>The substrate specificity of AziN has been investigated by using DNA containing different types of distortions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>).

While AZB-ICL DNA was distinctly cleaved to produce a small fragment, no incision was observed in the Ap-A ICL DNA samples after treatment with AziN at the same dose. Similarly, the protein did not act on mismatched DNA (MIS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7C</xref>). These results established the specific cleavage activity of AziN on AZB-ICL DNA and excluded distractions of possible contaminant nucleases in the protein preparation.</p><p>The lack of crystallographic data of highly homologous proteins as modelling templates makes the structure prediction of AziN and the identification of potential active sites an arduous task. Therefore, we used both SWISS-MODEL and PredictProtein servers to analyse the protein sequences, and 17 relatively conserved amino acid residues of AziN were selected for site-directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) to investigate their roles in incision and binding to AZB-ICL DNA. <italic>In vitro</italic> cleavage assay showed that most of mutants harboured near wild-type cleavage activities, except that mutations of L17A, W21A and R82D showed &#x0223c;20% of wild-type activity.

The forward strand of GCC2 was 3&#x02032;-end-FAM labeled (in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) and then served as the substrate for the DNA cleavage assay. The first alkylation reaction induced by AZB occurred mostly at 3&#x02032;-CGG-5&#x02032; of the reverse strand, but the FAM dye was labeled on the forward strand of GGC2. Hence, mono-alkylation products were invisible in this case, and the product with lower mobility than native DNA in 20% denatured polyacrylamide gel was supposed to be the crosslinked oligodeoxynucleotides (lane 2 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). As increasing concentrations of AziN were added, the intensity of the ICL DNA band decreased, and a new DNA fragment with higher mobility than the denatured native DNA appeared (lanes 4&#x02013;5 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), which was supposed to be the cleavage product of AziN.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, the small cleavage fragment of GCC2 was identical in mobility to M2 in denatured PAGE, which indicated that AziN catalysed hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond at the 3&#x02032; end of the crosslinking site on the forward strand to produce a 10-mer DNA fragment containing the FAM label at its 3&#x02032; end (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Incision of AziN on AZB-ICL oligodeoxynucleotides.

After AziN was added to the mixture, the migration band of ICL DNA disappeared, and a unique shift band with mobility between the mono-adducts and ICL DNA was generated (lanes 4 and 5). No DNA fragment smaller than native DNA, suggesting that there was no incision in the 3&#x02032; flanking region of the crosslinking site on the reverse strand. Thus, the new band presented in lanes 4 and 5 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> was regarded as the residual cleavage product after removal of the 3&#x02032; incised sequence in the forward strand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). In addition, the intensity of the mono-adduct band was almost untouched by AziN, implying that the protein incised ICL DNA rather than the mono-alkylation product.</p><p>To verify the above results and obtain a more comprehensive analysis of the AziN cleavage mode, a longer 29-bp oligodeoxynucleotide duplex (GCC6, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) was 3&#x02032;-end-FAM labeled on the forward strand (GCC6-1), reverse strand (GCC6-2), and both strands (GCC6-3). When FAM dye was labeled at the 3&#x02032; end of the forward strand (GCC6-1), a smaller band (fragment I) than native DNA was observed in both denatured and native PAGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>), while a larger band (fragment II) than mono-adduct DNA was traced in the cleavage products of the ICL DNA with a 3&#x02032;-end-FAM label on the reverse strand (GCC6-2). Two cleavage products (fragments I and II) were detected simultaneously when both strands of GCC6-3 were 3&#x02032;-end-FAM labelled (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">G</xref>). The mobility of fragment I was identical to that of the DNA marker M4 (18-nt-FAM/16-nt) in denatured PAGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">F</xref>), while it was slightly higher than that of M4 in native PAGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">G</xref>). It is evident that AziN could cut both strands of ICL DNA, and the cleavage site on the reverse strand should be in the 5&#x02032; flanking region of the crosslinking site. For precise localization of the cleavage sites, both ends of one DNA strand (GCC6-4 labelled on the forward strand and GCC6-5 labeled on the reverse strand) were labelled with 5&#x02032;-end-TAMRA and 3&#x02032;-end-FAM simultaneously. In addition to the large band of fragment II, a small band of 18-nt-FAM, regarded as the forward sequence of fragment I (lane 4 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>), and a small band of 11-nt-TAMRA, regarded as the reverse sequence of fragment I (lane 4 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>), were detected in the cleavage assay of crosslinked GCC6-4 and GCC6-5, respectively. The cleavage site on the reverse strand is supposed to be between the fifth and sixth nucleotides near the 5&#x02032; end of the cross-linking site. Thus, fragment II is most likely the other half of the cleavage products, which still contain crosslinking structures after a double stranded break (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Due to its high affinity with the drug, AziN can specifically recognize and bind the AZB-ICL DNA. Moreover, it can further lead to hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds adjacent to the crosslinked structure on both strands.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Characterization of the incision sites for AziN.

BLASTP analysis showed that AziN has homology and similarity with many unidentified members of the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme superfamily, but no putative conserved domains have been detected. In the sequence analysis of the Pfam database, AziN was classified as a member of the Glyoxalase_6 (PF18029) family of proteins due to the presence of a glyoxalase-like domain. This family of proteins contains a diverse set of domains related to the glyoxalase domain, and the specifics of their structure and function are uncertain. There are a few antibiotic resistance proteins in this superfamily, such as MRD, the bleomycin resistance proteins (Blms) and the fosfomycin resistance proteins (FosA/FosB/FosX) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Through either sequestration or inactivation, drug activities are prevented by these known resistance proteins (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref>). Unlike them, the specific binding of AziN with AZB had no influence on the antibacterial and crosslinking activities of the drug, suggesting the particular function of AziN. Although the interaction of AziN with Cu<sup>2+</sup> was detected, the drug binding ability and the cleavage activity of AziN are both independent of metal ions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4, S5 and S7</xref>). We suggest that AziN descended from an ancient metalloenzyme, and its catalytic activity changed after a natural evolutionary process while preserving metal-ion-binding capability, as previously reported as a possible explanation for the functional switching of MRD (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>It is suspected that drug-bind proteins can cooperate with drug-transporting proteins for intracellular drug efflux by capturing and delivering drugs. The drug efflux system, which serves as an elementary resistance mechanism against exogenous and endogenous toxins, is widespread in the cells of most living organisms and particularly plentiful in antibiotic-producing strains and drug-resistant pathogens (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In the AZB biosynthetic gene cluster, the transmembrane export protein AziE was verified to play a key role as an efflux pump in resistance to AZB. The single heterologous expression of AziE or AziN can improve AZB resistance in the sensitive strain <italic>S. lividans</italic> ZX1. AZB production decreased more markedly in the <italic>aziN</italic> gene deletion mutant than in the <italic>aziE</italic> gene deletion mutant (Xiaorong Chen and Jing He, unpublished work). Obviously, the functions of the two resistance proteins are not closely linked to each other. AziN was proven exert its drug resistance function by its involvement in ICL repair rather than through drug sequestration and efflux.</p><p>The first identified AZB binding protein AziR, homologous to aminoglycoside phosphotransferases, can also provide resistance against AZB toxicity to the heterologous hosts <italic>S. lividans</italic> TK24 and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). No chemical modification of AZB was found in the interaction of AziR and the drug, but regrettably, the potential drug sequestration effect of canonical binding proteins has not been tested. Except for <italic>aziR</italic>, the other three resistance determinants, <italic>aziE</italic>, <italic>alkZ</italic> and <italic>aziN</italic>, are all located within the AZB biosynthetic gene cluster and associated with drug production. Both <italic>alkZ</italic> and <italic>aziN</italic> can specifically recognize and excise AZB-ICL DNA. The DNA glycosylase AlkZ catalyses the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of the alkylated nucleobase to repair ICLs by triggering a BER-like pathway (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), while AziN induces hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds around ICL sites. Without conserved DNA binding domains, the interaction of AziN with ICL DNA is mediated by the drug. AziN has selectivity and specificity for AZB&#x02013;ICL DNA, a kind of specific DNA structure, rather than for a DNA sequence, behaving as a structure-specific endonuclease. This kind of endonuclease usually resolves specific DNA secondary structures such as single-stranded flaps, stem-loops, Holliday junctions and DNA adducts that arise during DNA damage repair, DNA recombination, DNA replication and transcription stress processes (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). ICL repair also relies on structure-specific endonucleases to cut DNA strands at lesion sites (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45&#x02013;47</xref>). Despite the lack of similarity to known endonucleases, the structure-specific endonuclease activity of AziN to cut the damaged strands was verified by an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay in this study. The repair of ICLs is a complex, multi-step process requiring the cooperation of many DNA repair proteins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Our research has shown that the protein AziN is involved in the damage recognition and incision steps of the ICL repair process, most likely in cooperation and coordination with other nucleases and regulation factors. The resulting DNA gap is generally filled by downstream translesion synthesis and homologous recombination before the remnant ICL structure is completely removed by NER (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J</xref>). Future intensive studies on the enzymatic and structural characteristics of AziN and screening of its collaborators in ICL repair will set a basis to elucidate the action mode and regulatory mechanism of this new type of structure-specific endonuclease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>The protein sequence of Orf3/Azi38 that renamed&#x000a0;as AziN has been submitted to the GenBank database with accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MK453398">MK453398</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz1067_Supplemental_File</label><media xlink:href="gkz1067_supplemental_file.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank research associates at Centre for Protein Research (CPR), Huazhong agricultural University, for technical support of microscale thermophoresis assay.</p></ack><sec id="SEC6"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>
