Worldwide both the incidence and mortality rates for prostate cancer are recently increasing, even in low-risk populations (<xref rid="b11-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Hsing et al. 2000</xref>). However, the etiology of prostate cancer remains incompletely defined. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that cadmium, a known human carcinogen, is a potential prostatic carcinogen (<xref rid="b15-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">International Agency for Cancer Research 1993</xref>; <xref rid="b37-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Waalkes 2003</xref>), and rodent studies clearly show cadmium can induce prostate cancer (<xref rid="b37-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Waalkes 2003</xref>). In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> model systems show cadmium can induce malignant transformation of both human (<xref rid="b1-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Achanzar et al. 2001</xref>) and rodent prostate epithelial cells (<xref rid="b32-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Terracio and Nachtigal 1988</xref>). Indeed, our recent work showed that cadmium can induce malignant transformation of the human prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) (<xref rid="b1-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Achanzar et al. 2001</xref>) and that these cadmium-transformed prostate epithelial (CTPE) cells acquire apoptotic resistance concurrently with malignant phenotype (<xref rid="b2-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Achanzar et al. 2002</xref>). However, the exact mechanism by which cadmium induces malignant transformation is unclear.</p><p>Apoptosis is a form of cell suicide that plays an important role in development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms (<xref rid="b30-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Shivapurkar et al. 2003</xref>). Apoptosis also plays an essential role in the elimination of mutated or transformed cells from the body (<xref rid="b30-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Shivapurkar et al. 2003</xref>). Disruption of apoptosis plays a major role in tumor formation and malignant progression (<xref rid="b19-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Lowe and Lin 2000</xref>). In fact, acquired resistance toward apoptosis is a hallmark of most types of cancer (<xref rid="b8-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Hanahan and Weinberg 2000</xref>). Tumor cells and their precursors have multiple mechanisms to escape or avoid apoptosis that favor survival. The expansion of a tumor cell population is determined not only by the rate of cell proliferation but also by the rate of cell apoptosis. Tumor growth thus depends on the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis. Therefore, acquired resistance to apoptosis could have important implications in both tumor initiation and progression.</p><p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) comprise a family of serine/threonine phosphorylating proteins that mediate the signal transduction pathways from a variety of extracellular signals to regulate the expression of specific genes (<xref rid="b27-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b40-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al. 1995</xref>). The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) typically transduce growth factor signals that cause cell differentiation or proliferation. Stress signals activate the c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 path-ways to produce stress response, growth arrest, and apoptosis. These MAPKs are activated by the dual phosphorylation of specific tyrosine and threonine residues, which is performed by regulatory kinases upstream in the signaling cascade. Although activation of JNK and p38 MAPK pathways has been associated with induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="b40-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al. 1995</xref>), the precise mechanisms involved in the JNK-induced apoptotic response remain to be determined.</p><p>Three subfamilies of Bcl-2 [Gene ID: 24224; <xref rid="b22-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 2007</xref>) proteins have been identified to play important roles in the apoptotic response. Of these subfamily members, the Bcl-2 subfamily functions to inhibit apoptosis, whereas the Bax (Gene ID: 12028; <xref rid="b22-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">NCBI 2007</xref>) and BH3 subfamilies tend to promote apoptosis (<xref rid="b7-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Gross et al. 1999</xref>). Bcl-2 is an intracellular membrane-associated protein that can prevent cell death induced by a variety of apoptotic stimuli (<xref rid="b24-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. 1997</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the Bax subfamily is essential for apoptotic signal trans-duction by JNK (<xref rid="b5-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Frisch et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b23-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. 1996</xref>, <xref rid="b24-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The JNK signaling pathway is required for stress-induced release of mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and apoptosis (<xref rid="b18-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to define the mechanisms of apoptotic resistance and any concurrent alterations in signal trans-duction pathways in cadmium-induced malignant transformation using our established <italic>in vitro</italic> human prostate epithelial carcinogenesis cell model system. Using this system, we found that cadmium-transformed cells acquired tolerance to acute cadmium cytotoxicity and became highly resistant to chemically induced apoptosis. This acquired apoptotic resistance in cadmium-transformed cells appeared to be due to overexpression of Bcl-2, which blocked the activation of the JNK signaling pathway by various apoptotic stresses.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>), etoposide, cisplatin, chloroform, isopropanol, formaldehyde, and ethidium bromide were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

Although immortalized, RWPE-1 cells have retained properties exhibited by normal prostate epithelium <italic>in vivo</italic>. The CTPE cell line was developed by chronic cadmium exposure of the RWPE-1 cell line as previously described, and CTPE cells form aggressive, prostate carcinoma-like tumors upon inoculation into nude mice (<xref rid="b1-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Achanzar et al. 2001</xref>). The observed malignant transformation in CTPE cells is not reversible after removal from cadmium. To define steady-state events and to prevent acute phase effects of cadmium, cells were placed in cadmium-free media for 2 or more weeks before the assessment of experiments. Control and CTPE cells were grown in keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM) containing 50 &#x003bc;g/mL bovine pituitary extract (BPE), 5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 1 &#x000d7; antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (10,000 U/mL penicillin G sodium, 10,000 &#x003bc;g/mL streptomycin sulfate, 25 &#x003bc;g/mL amphotericin B).

Bcl-2 expression was under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. A Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to replace the A nucleotide with a C in the coding sequence, leading to the substitution of a serine for a tyrosine at the 21st amino acid in the protein sequence.

The quantity of formazan product, as measured by absorbance at 490 nm, is directly proportional to the number of living cells. A minimum of four replicates of 10,000 cells per well were plated in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere to the plate for 24 hr, at which time the media was removed and replaced with fresh media containing the cadmium.

In the present study, CTPE and passage-matched RWPE-1 control cells were treated with cadmium for 24 hr, and cytotoxicity was measured.

Cadmium-induced apoptosis was markedly reduced in CTPE cells compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0115-001094">Figure 1A</xref>). These results indicate that after transformation has occurred, cells acquired a marked resistance to apoptosis induced by cadmium. Furthermore, to detect whether the CTPE cells possessed generalized apoptotic resistance, control and CTPE cells were treated with etoposide, a DNA repair inhibitor and potent apoptogen, or cisplatin, a chemo-therapeutic compound, for 24 hr. Analysis of the flow cytometry data revealed that CTPE cells had about 40% fewer apoptotic cells than control when exposed to either etoposide or cisplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0115-001094">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cadmium-transformed phenotype shows reduced JNK1/2 phosphorylation and JNK1/2 kinase activity</title><p>The JNK and p38 pathways have been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis induced by various stimuli (<xref rid="b40-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al. 1995</xref>). Several recent articles have suggested that ERK might also be involved in apoptotic signaling (e.g., <xref rid="b20-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Mohr et al. 1998</xref>). To determine which signal pathway may be involved in cadmium-induced apoptosis, cells were acutely subjected to cadmium (0, 10, 50 or 100 &#x003bc;M) for 30 min. The levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 were determined by Western blot analysis. All three MAPKs were phosphorylated in a cadmium concentration-dependent fashion both in control and CTPE cells. Interestingly, the level of phosphorylated JNK1/2 was markedly decreased in the CTPE cells compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0115-001094">Figure 2A</xref>). The membrane used to define the phosphorylated form was stripped, then reprobed with antibody against JNK that recognizes both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms to assess total JNK1/2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0115-001094">Figure 2B</xref>, no major differences were observed in the levels of total JNK1/2. Thus, the decrease in phosphorylated JNK represents a decrease in phosphorylation of the native protein in transformed cells rather than a reduction in total cellular JNK protein. The levels of both phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 did not show any significant differences between control and CTPE cells (data not shown). Dual phosphorylation of JNKs at Thr183/Tyr185 is essential for kinase activity and phosphorylation at these sites is an excellent marker of JNK activity. To confirm JNK activation, an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed using a c-Jun N-terminal fusion protein as the substrate. After acute cadmium exposure, JNK kinase activation was markedly reduced in CTPE cells compared with control cells in both the concentration&#x02013;response and time-course analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0115-001094">Figure 2C</xref>). The levels of phosphorylation of JNK determined by using the phospho-specific antibody were thus consistent with the kinase activity of JNK in cell extracts.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Ro318220 on JNK1/2 kinase activity and apoptosis</title><p>The compound Ro318220 (Ro) is a strong activator of JNK (<xref rid="b4-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Beltman et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b29-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Sandau et al. 1999</xref>). Thus, studies were designed to determine if Ro318220 could bypass the blockage of JNK kinase activity in CTPE cells. Cells were pre-treated with Ro318220 (10 &#x003bc;M, 30 min) followed by acute cadmium exposure (100 &#x003bc;M, 30 min), and an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed using a c-Jun N-terminal fusion protein as the substrate. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0115-001094">Figure 3A</xref>, after cadmium treatment JNK kinase activity was much lower in CTPE cells compared with control, confirming early experiments. However, pretreatment with Ro318220 before cadmium effectively bypassed this block in JNK activity, bringing JNK kinase activity in CTPE cells to control levels. EGF, used as a positive control for stimulating JNK activity, was much less effective in CTPE than control cells. These results suggest that the activation of the JNK pathway is perturbed in CTPE cells, specifically at the point of JNK phosphorylation. To confirm that the effects of Ro318220 depend JNK1/2 activation and are not due to protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition, similar experiments were performed with staurosporine (40 nM) and GF109203 (2.5 mM), two well-known PKC inhibitors (<xref rid="b4-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Beltman et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b29-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Sandau et al. 1999</xref>). In contrast to the effects of Ro318220 on JNK kinase activation, both staurosporine and GF109203 did not affect JNK kinase activation in either control or CTPE cells. To determine if JNK activation through Ro318220 could bypass the apoptotic block seen after cadmium-induced transformation, cells were pretreated with Ro318220 before cadmium treatment and apoptosis was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0115-001094">Figure 3B</xref>). Cadmium was again markedly less effective in inducing apoptosis in CTPE cells compared with control. The addition of Ro318220 before acute cadmium treatment significantly increased apoptotic rate between 2.6- and 3.7-fold in CTPE cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes</title><p>Bax is an important pro-apoptotic protein and Bcl-2 is an important anti-apoptotic protein.

These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0115-001094">Figure 4B</xref>). The levels of Bcl-2 protein were substantially increased (~ 5-fold), whereas the level of Bax protein was markedly decreased (~ 2-fold) in the CTPE cells. The densitometric analysis showed that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, which is though to be an important determinant in dictating apoptosis, was significantly increased (more than 4-fold) in CTPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0115-001094">Figure 4C</xref>), a finding indicative of reduced apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Bcl-2 suppresses the JNK1/2 phosphorylation and apoptosis induced by cadmium</title><p>To help define any possible interplay between Bcl-2 and JNK1/2, <italic>Bcl-2</italic> was transfected via a murine expression vector into PT-67 cells.

Furthermore, the effect of acute cadmium treatment on JNK1/2 phosphorylation in either vector control or <italic>Bcl-2</italic>&#x02013;trans-fected cells was examined.

Whatever the basis, an important mechanism could be the disruption of signal transduction pathways resulting in aberrant cell accumulation. In this regard, the present study demonstrates that chronic cadmium-transformed prostate epithelial cells acquire generalized tolerance to chemically induced apoptosis. Disruption of apoptosis plays a major role in tumor formation and malignant progression. The activation of apoptosis is regulated by many different signals that originate from both intracellular and the extracellular sites (<xref rid="b34-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Vasilevskaya and O&#x02019;Dwyer 2003</xref>). For example, the JNK signaling pathway has been implicated in the apoptotic response of cells exposed to stress. Several studies indicate that genotoxic stress induces translocation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK to mitochondria (<xref rid="b17-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Kharbanda et al. 2000</xref>). Mitochondria are influenced by pro-apoptotic signal transduction through the JNK pathway, and the absence of JNK caused a defect in the mitochondrial death-signaling pathway, including the failure to release cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (<xref rid="b33-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Tournier et al. 2000</xref>). Therefore, JNK is required for stress-induced activation of the cyto-chrome <italic>c</italic>&#x02013;mediated death pathway (<xref rid="b33-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Tournier et al. 2000</xref>). The results of the present study clearly demonstrate that JNK activation is perturbed in cadmium-transformed cells and that Ro318220, a strong activator of JNK, circumvents this apoptotic resistance. Therefore, cadmium-induced resistance to apoptosis appears to involve the specific suppression of the JNK pathways, which increases cell survival and decreases apoptosis (<xref rid="b36-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Vivo et al. 2003</xref>). In this regard, our prior work showed that after arsenite induced malignant transformation <italic>in vitro</italic>, generalized resistance to apoptosis develops, likely due to perturbation of the JNK pathway (<xref rid="b27-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al. 2002</xref>). In fact, these results are consistent with several reports that the stimulation of JNK is a prerequisite for cell apoptosis under various conditions, and a blockade of JNK activation results in the prevention of apoptosis (<xref rid="b35-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Verheij et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b36-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Vivo et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b40-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al. 1995</xref>). This blockade of apoptosis could be a key factor in cadmium carcinogenesis.</p><p>There are many possible targets of the JNK signaling pathway that may affect the mitochondria, including members of the Bcl-2 group of apoptotic regulatory proteins (<xref rid="b33-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Tournier et al. 2000</xref>). It has been reported that the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is phosphorylated and inactivated by JNK (<xref rid="b41-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto et al. 1999</xref>). Bcl-2 disrupts a signaling cascade to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation induced by the apoptotic stresses (<xref rid="b24-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. 1997</xref>). However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which Bcl-2 prevents cell death remain unknown. It has been proposed that Bcl-2 might suppress cell death by modulating intracellular signaling cascades associated with apoptosis (<xref rid="b24-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. 1997</xref>). The cloning and characterization of the Bcl-2 oncogene established the importance of apoptosis in tumor development (<xref rid="b19-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Lowe and Lin 2000</xref>). For example, Bcl-2 promotes cell survival by blocking programmed cell death and disrupting normal proliferation (<xref rid="b10-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Hockenbery et al. 1990</xref>; <xref rid="b21-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">McDonnell et al. 1989</xref>). It is recognized that Bcl-2 is expressed in a variety of human tumors. In particular, Bcl-2 overexpression is associated with prostate carcinoma (<xref rid="b9-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann et al. 1997</xref>). Conversely, Bax is a death promoter that is inactivated in certain types of cancer and plays critical roles in the initiation and execution of the apoptotic program (<xref rid="b25-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Putcha et al. 2003</xref>). The present study demonstrates that Bax protein levels were greatly reduced, and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression markedly increased in CTPE cells as compared with RWPE-1 cells. <italic>Bcl-2:Bax</italic> ratio was approximately four times higher in CTPE cells than in control cells, which is consistent with perturbed apoptosis. The suppression of cell death could favor the development and progression of neoplasms by providing a selective survival advantage for transformed cells. Furthermore, upon investigation of a possible interplay between Bcl-2 and JNK1/2, we found the level of phosphorylated JNK1/2 was markedly decreased in a cadmium dose-dependent manner in <italic>Bcl-2</italic>&#x02013;transfected cells. Also, cadmium- or etoposide-induced apoptosis was markedly reduced in Bcl-2&#x02013;expressing cells compared with vector control cells. These data indicate that the intracellular signaling pathway for JNK stimulation is defective in Bcl-2&#x02013;overexpressing cells, and Bcl-2 prevents both JNK signaling and cell death induced by various apoptotic stresses. The JNK signaling pathway might be downstream from the target of Bcl-2 action. Further study will be required to define precisely the interplay between JNK and Bcl-2.</p><p>The anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family contain four homology domains, BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 (<xref rid="b16-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Janumyan et al. 2003</xref>). The five most closely related mammalian homologues are Bcl-2, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (Gene ID: 12048), Bcl-w (Gene ID: 12050), and Bax and Bak (Gene ID: 12018) (<xref rid="b22-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">NCBI 2007</xref>). However, only the first three contain the N-terminal BH4 domain and inhibit apoptosis (<xref rid="b12-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. 1998</xref>). BH1 and BH2 of Bax are critical for promoting cell survival, but Bax does not contain a region functionally equivalent to BH4 of Bcl-2 (<xref rid="b12-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. 1998</xref>). To determine whether the BH4 region of Bcl-2 is essential for its anti-apoptotic function and regulation with JNK signal transduction pathway, we established a Bcl-2 Y21 mutant cell line by site-specific mutagenesis, which replaces the tyrosine with a serine at the 21st amino acid. Our results showed that <italic>Bcl-2</italic>&#x02013;transfected cells were resistant to cadmium- or etoposide-induced apoptosis. Mutation of tyrosine at the 21st amino acid to serine resulted in loss of anti-apoptotic function that resulted in Bcl-2 Y21 mutant cells becoming as sensitive as vector control cells to apoptosis. Thus, the N-terminal BH4 domain is essential for the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2, confirming previous published reports (<xref rid="b12-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="b14-ehp0115-001094" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al. 1996</xref>). Most interestingly, our study showed that the level of phosphorylated JNK1/2 was markedly lower in <italic>Bcl-2</italic>&#x02013;trans-fected cells than in vector control cells with cadmium treatment, but partially restored in <italic>Bcl-2</italic> Y21 mutant cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the Bcl-2 BH4 domain is required for modulating JNK phosphorylation and anti-apoptotic function.</p><p>In summary, after cadmium-induced malignant transformation has occurred in human prostate epithelial cells, transformed cells acquire resistance to apoptosis. The acquisition of apoptotic resistance appears to be linked to an increase in the anti-apoptotic action of Bcl-2 that perturbs the JNK signal transduction pathway. The Bcl-2 BH4 domain is required for modulating JNK phosphorylation and anti-apoptotic function. This acquired self-resistance to apoptosis may play an important role in cadmium-induced tumor initiation and progression.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>We thank L.K. Keefer, J. Liu, and E.
