biology offers a new path for the exploitation and improvement
of natural products to address the growing crisis in antibiotic resistance.
All antibiotics in clinical use are facing eventual obsolesce as a
result of the evolution and dissemination of resistance mechanisms,
yet there are few new drug leads forthcoming from the pharmaceutical
sector. Natural products of microbial origin have proven over the
past 70 years to be the wellspring of antimicrobial drugs. Harnessing
synthetic biology thinking and strategies can provide new molecules
and expand chemical diversity of known antibiotic scaffolds to provide
much needed new drug leads. The glycopeptide antibiotics offer paradigmatic
scaffolds suitable for such an approach. We review these strategies
here using the glycopeptides as an example and demonstrate how synthetic
biology can expand antibiotic chemical diversity to help address the
growing resistance crisis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antibiotic scaffold</kwd><kwd>tailoring enzymes</kwd><kwd>heterologous

successful drugs discovered and developed over the past century. The
first clinically useful antimicrobial compounds were synthetic molecules
including dyes, organometallic complexes, and structurally simple
aromatic compounds. The discovery and purification of antibiotics
(a term first used to describe antimicrobial compounds derived from
living organisms) such as penicillin, gramicidin, tyrocidine, and
streptomycin in the late 1930s and early 1940s ushered in what has
become known as the Golden Age of antibiotics: a decade and a half
where the products of microbial secondary metabolism were systematically
screened for antibiotic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The
vast majority of chemical scaffolds in current clinical use can be
traced back to this relatively short period of time. The remarkable
richness of microbial natural products as sources of antibiotics reflects
the fact that they are products of evolution, selected over millennia
for interaction with biological targets. When compared to synthetic
molecules that are generally the result of experimental campaigns
based on chemical diversity that is readily accessible in the lab,
the privileged nature of microbially derived natural products as antibiotics
becomes clear.</p><p>A hallmark of antibiotic natural products is
their chemical diversity
and complexity (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This chemical diversity
is based on the production of chemical scaffolds consisting of peptide,
polyketide, carbohydrate, alkaloid, or terpene backbones that serve
as the core structure. These scaffolds are then modified by a variety
of chemical reactions catalyzed by a broad spectrum of tailoring enzymes
that are co-produced with the scaffold assembly machinery. Scaffold-tailoring
reactions include isomerization and racemization, reduction and oxidation
(including hydroxylation), as well as group transfer such as acylation,
methylation, glycosylation, sulfation, phosphorylation, and halogenation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> As a result the end products are often chemically
complex, stereochemically intricate, and rich in hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors. For example, the antibiotic erythromycin has 18 chiral
centers compared to none for the synthetic antibiotic ciprofloxacin.
Moreover the macrocyclic polyketide scaffold of erythromycin, 6-deoxyerythronolide,
is further modified by glycosylation by two unusual carbohydrates
that contribute to bioactivity and bioavailability to complete the
antibiotic. Nature&#x02019;s ability to generate a large number of
natural product scaffolds, including the combination of scaffolds
to produce hybrids, and to tailor them in combinatorial fashion results
in near limitless bioactive chemical diversity. Nevertheless, despite
the proven track record of natural products in drug and antibiotic
discovery, they have largely been abandoned by the pharmaceutical
sector in favor of large libraries of synthetic molecules.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Chemical diversity
and complexity of antibiotics in nature. Antibiotics
derived from microbial sources are rich in chiral centers and hydrogen
bond donors and acceptors and span an order of magnitude in molecular
weight.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="sb-2012-00092n_0001" id="gr1" position="float"/></fig><p>The rich bioactivity of natural
products is the result of chemical
diversity that is intrinsically compatible with interaction with proteins,
nucleic acids, and membranes under physiological conditions and fine-tuned
by natural selection. It is therefore not surprising then that natural
products and their derivatives dominate the molecules that find use
as drugs and drug leads including antibiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Yet
despite their success, the drug discovery sector has turned away from
these molecules over the past two decades in favor of small synthetic
molecules. As outlined by Li and Vederas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> the reasons for the abandonment of natural products by the pharmaceutical
industry are multifactorial, yet there are two significant reasons
for the current emphasis on small synthetic molecules over natural
products. First is the limited number of natural scaffolds discovered
that have proven suitable for downstream antibiotic development. Second
are the significant technical challenges in the identification, purification,
synthesis, and scale up production of natural products for the preparation
of diverse libraries suitable for screening and lead optimization.
On the other hand, synthetic and combinatorial chemistry provide tractable
molecules that, while often lacking in innate bioactivity, can be
readily modified in the lab by medicinal chemists. Drug discovery
firms therefore have largely chosen to forego the rich bioactivity
of natural products, and their associated chemical challenges, in
favor of the predictable outcomes of synthetic chemistry. The fruits
of this emphasis on synthetic molecules are evident in the absence
of new antibiotics brought to market over the past 20 years.</p><p>There is a growing clinical need for new antibiotics that is driven
by the emergence and prevalence of multidrug resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> As noted by Fischbach and Walsh, our current
arsenal of broad spectrum antibiotics is dominated by only four major
scaffolds:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> cephalosporins, penicillins,
quinolones, and macrolides, all of which were discovered almost half
a century ago. Other distinct chemical scaffolds are also important,
among them glycopeptides, lipopeptides, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines,
but these generally have more narrow application than the &#x0201c;big
four&#x0201d;. The innovation gap in new antibiotic scaffold identification
over the past 50 years has been obscured by the great success in tailoring
of existing scaffolds either by the discovery of natural variants
or by medicinal chemical modification in the lab. The challenges faced
by antibiotic field are emblematic of a general crisis in the generation
of new bioactive chemical matter in drug discovery.</p><p>Fortunately,
new genomic technologies including rapid and low-cost
DNA sequencing and a growing understanding of the mechanistic details
of natural product biosynthesis, along with innovation in chemical
synthesis and analytical methods, can be combined to expand bioactive
chemical diversity in a fashion that is compatible with high-throughput
technology and begin to overcome the innovation gap in antibiotic
discovery. In order to fully exploit the privileged nature of natural
products in antibiotic drug discovery, what is required is the ability
to rapidly identify scaffolds, tailor them using a collection of modifying
enzymes, and rapidly purify the resulting compounds in sufficient
quantity to generate libraries of molecules suitable for high-throughput
screening. The rise of synthetic biology offers a tremendous opportunity
to address these issues. At the same time, medicinal chemical modification
of natural product scaffolds and <italic>de novo</italic> compound
synthesis of new natural product-inspired scaffolds will increase
the value of synthetic libraries in drug discovery.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Synthetic Biology
and Antibiotics</title><p>Natural products are genetically encoded
small molecules. They
represent a rich source of privileged chemical structures that have
evolved over millennia specifically to interact with biological macromolecules.
Nevertheless, there remain some significant barriers for the widespread
integration of natural products in modern high-throughput antibiotic
discovery including issues of compound availability, purity, and chemical
complexity. Fortuitously, the renewed interest in natural products
as drug leads is concurrent with the development of new technologies
in genomics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, and chemical synthesis
that are enabling a new assessment of the compatibility of natural
products with modern drug discovery. In particular, synthetic biology
has the potential to play a leading role in this area and holds real
promise to help overcome some of the challenges for increased integration
of natural products in antibiotic drug discovery.</p><p>The genes
encoding natural products are generally clustered together
in the genomes of microbes that produce natural products. The low
cost of DNA sequencing, continuing improvements in predicting natural
product chemical structures from biosynthetic gene sequences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> and a growing understanding of the molecular details of biosynthetic
chemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> have dramatically increased
the number of well-characterized natural product biosynthetic pathways
in the past 15 years. This work is not limited to cases where a producing
organism is known and cultivated, and indeed whole biosynthetic pathways
have been successfully reconstructed from metagenomic libraries bypassing
the frequent bottleneck of successfully culturing natural product-producing
microbes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, there have been
several examples of gene mutation, deletion, replacement, and introduction
into natural product producing bacteria that have generated new compounds,
an approach termed combinatorial biosynthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> This approach was pioneered by Hopwood and colleagues,
who first genetically manipulated the antibiotic pigment actinorhodin
in the producing organism <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Researchers at Kosan later refined
the combinatorial biosynthesis approach and demonstrated that systematic
and rational mutation of an antibiotic biosynthetic pathway could
generate libraries of novel and predicted compounds and that this
biosynthetic machinery could be recapitulated in a heterologous host,
in this case <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>What has been lacking in these early efforts to make
what we now
would term &#x0201c;synthetic biological strategies&#x0201d; generally
applicable and compatible with modern drug discovery is a series of
predictable and unifying rules of assembly and production such that
&#x0201c;unnatural&#x0201d; natural products can be designed and expressed
in large quantities with minimal purification steps. Nevertheless,
the field is now well suited for a coordinated synthetic biology effort
to increase natural product antibiotic diversity and the preparation
of large libraries suitable for drug discovery.</p><p>In the vernacular
of synthetic biology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> the genes encoding
scaffolds (peptides, polyketides, etc.) and various
tailoring enzymes are <bold>Parts</bold> that can be assembled to

compounds. These are coexpressed in a <bold>Chassis</bold>, a suitable
host (bacteria, yeast) for generation of engineered natural products.
By systematically manipulating <bold>Parts</bold> and <bold>Devices</bold> within an appropriate <bold>Chassis</bold>, the resulting compounds
can be assembled in a library for drug discovery (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Representative model for the application of synthetic

the promise of synthetic biology approaches in expanding bioactive
chemical diversity and accessibility of privileged natural product
structures.</p><p>To fully realize the promise of synthetic biology
applications
in natural product biosynthesis requires investment in the following
areas:</p><p><bold>1. A complete toolkit.</bold> This includes all
of the tailoring
enzymes and all of the scaffolds. There has been great progress in
this area over the past decade. For example, glycosyltransferases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> sulfotransferases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> and acyltransferases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> have all be used to generate &#x0201c;unnatural&#x0201d;
natural products. Access to new biological diversity (microbial and
plant) and understanding of substrate specificity of tailoring enzymes
and scaffold biochemistry will expand these resources.</p><p><bold>2. Dependable circuit diagrams.</bold> This will require
improved understanding of the regulation of natural product genes
to generate efficient biosynthetic circuits suitable for production
of compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Recent evidence suggests
that gene expression is precisely staged during natural product biosynthesis
with the small molecule products of early gene expression inducing
the expression of late gene expression such as transporters and resistance
elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Also essential is an understanding
of how these pathways draw on host metabolism and what impact this
has on cell growth.</p><p><bold>3. Robust chassis.</bold> Hosts that
have been engineered
to produce a single compound (or family) that can be easily purified
will greatly improve the recovery of the pure molecules that are important
for reproducible high-throughput testing. Organisms that are robust
producers of natural products (e.g., <italic>Streptomyces</italic>) offer advantages of intrinsic metabolism that supports secondary
metabolite production, while nonproducers such as <italic>E. coli</italic> have been successfully manipulated for natural product production.
A collection of optimized potential hosts will no doubt be required
to maximize the production potential of various scaffolds.</p><p>Finally,
new scaffolds need not be derived from natural products,
and there remains an important role for synthetic chemistry to expand
bioactive chemical space suitable for drug discovery. Growing efforts
to generate libraries of complex synthetic molecules that emulate
natural product chemical diversity such as diversity-oriented synthesis
are yielding new chemical matter with novel activity (e.g., ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>)). Furthermore, new chemical
catalysts with the ability to expand natural product diversity are
proving robust and useful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Indeed, chemical synthesis
and synthetic biology strategies to expand bioactive chemical diversity
are not mutually exclusive and can be complementary (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In fact there is a long history of merging synthesis
and natural product biosynthesis in the form of mutasynthesis, precursor-directed
biosynthesis, and semisynthetic medicinal chemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> All of these strategies can be brought together to help
address the antibiotic crisis.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Glycopeptides: A Model
Platform To Explore Antibiotic Synthetic
Biology</title><p>Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) offer a useful example
where we
and others have initiated efforts to explore the applicability of
synthetic biology approaches in an effort to expand the chemical diversity
of a natural product class. GPAs (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>)
are critically important antibiotics that target Gram-positive bacteria
by binding to the acyl-<sc>d</sc>-alanyl-<sc>d</sc>-alanine terminus
of growing peptidoglycan. This interaction physically blocks cell
wall biosynthetic enzymes, inhibiting cell growth and division. They
remain essential drugs for the treatment of life-threatening infections
caused by important human pathogens such as <italic>Staphylococcus
aureus</italic> and <italic>Enterococc</italic>us sp. The antibiotics
consist of a heptapeptide scaffold that is matured to the active antibiotic
via a series of tailoring enzymes that oxidatively catalyze 3&#x02013;4
intramolecular cyclizations and a variety of modifications including
glycosylation, halogenation, acylation, etc. (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Two distinct peptide scaffolds that include two unusual
amino acids, 4-hydroxylphenylglycine (Hpg) and 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine
(Dpg), are in current clinical use exemplified by vancomycin (Leu-Bht-Asn-Hpg-Hpg-Bht-Dpg)
and teicoplanin (Hpg-Tyr-Dpg-Hpg-Hpg-Bht-Dpg). Since the discovery
of vancomycin in 1953, a large number of GPAs have been isolated.
These molecules generally retain the canonical heptapeptide cores
and vary in their accessorization by various functional groups. Nicolaou
and colleagues have catalogued an exhaustive list of all of the functional
groups attached at various positions in different GPAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> The first reported GPA biosynthetic gene clusters
revealed a predicted set of nonribosomal peptide synthetase units
required for assembling the peptide scaffold along with genes encoding
amino acid and sugar biosynthesis, self-resistance, export, and tailoring
enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> This pattern is repeated in all other GPA
clusters (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Here we will focus on
the molecules with known biosynthetic machinery, which can be utilized
to assemble novel GPAs using a synthetic biology approach. These include
the A47934, A40926, teicoplanin, chloroeremomycin, vancomycin, balhimycin,
VEG, TEG, CA37, CA878, and CA915 GPA biosynthetic clusters along with

and (2) secondary modifications, referring to tailoring of primary
modifications (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). Thus, the presence

is the most prevalent modification observed in GPA scaffolds. This
functionalization is also common among the glycopeptide variants such
as actinoidin, complestatin, and kistamycin. Chlorination has been
implicated in imparting rotamer stability to the molecule during the
assembly stage and also in the intermolecular dimerization of GPAs
in solution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> The GPA biosynthetic clusters
sequenced so far show the presence of either one or two halogenases
in every cluster (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). They are implicated
in the addition of chlorine(s) ranging from one Cl atom per GPA molecule
in pekiskomycin to four in the case of UK68597. Chemical diversity
is also achieved by the ability of halogenases to add chlorine to
different amino acids of the heptapeptide. Tyr (or its &#x003b2;-hydroxy
version, Bht) at positions 2 and 6 are the most commonly chlorinated
amino acids as seen in chloroeremomycin, vancomycin, balhimycin, teicoplanin,
UK68597, and A47934. Both chlorine molecules are added by the same
halogenase as demonstrated by the deletion of <italic>bhaA</italic>, the sole halogenase in the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster,
resulting in complete absence of Cl from the resulting antibiotic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> The halogenase in A40926 biosynthetic cluster
of <italic>Nonomuraea</italic> sp. shows some variation in function
where it chlorinates Dpg<sub>3</sub> instead of Tyr<sub>2</sub>. Pekiskomycin
is a monohalogenated GPA where the putative halogenase Pek27 adds
a chlorine atom on Bht<sub>6</sub>. An additional chlorination on
Hpg<sub>5</sub> of A47934 is proposed to occur by another halogenase
present in the cluster, StaK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> Similarly,
a second halogenase is present in the UK68597 cluster, which we attribute
to chlorination of Hpg<sub>1</sub> and Hpg<sub>5</sub>. Thus, the
use of these enzymes in selected combinations provides enough choices
to create many backbone variations. Furthermore, degeneracy in reagent
specificity of these enzymes allows additional leverage in modifications.
In the balhimycin producer <italic>Amycolatopsis balhimycina</italic>, bromobalhimycin and bromochlorobalhimycin were obtained by simply

is a relatively uncommon yet very
interesting modification on GPAs. By loading a sulfate molecule on

sulfation plays an important role in evading the induction of resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> Only two naturally occurring sulfated GPAs,

AZ205, is a Bht<sub>6</sub> modifying analogue of Teg13.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> By using these enzymes in different combinations,
15 modifications of teicoplanin-type GPA with mono-, di-, and trisulfated
derivatives have been created.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Interestingly
all of the sulfotransferases, including those identified from metagenomes,
belong to the teicoplanin type of GPA.</p><p>StaL was the first GPA
sulfotransferase to have its 3D structure determined by X-ray crystallography,
which showed that the protein exists as a dimer and has a dimerization
motif unique from the other known sulfotransferases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> The subsequent determination of the structures of two additional
sulfotransferases, Teg12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> and Teg14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> with alternate regiospecificity, suggests that
these enzymes must have a unique substrate binding pattern in their
variable regions, to orient the active site toward different parts
of the heptapeptide scaffold. Recent updates from co-crystallization
of StaL bound to the substrate (desulfo-A47934) and product of sufate
donation (3&#x02032;-phosphoadenosine 5&#x02032;-phosphate) have improved
our understanding of the reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> It
clearly shows that even though the protein exists as a dimer, only
one of the active sites can accommodate the GPA backbone in proper
orientation. Interestingly, StaL also demands a conformational flexibility
from the canonical cup shape of the heptapeptide core as the enzyme
can only recognize the more planar conformation observed in desulfo-A47934.
The information provides a deeper understanding useful in predicting
the behavior of these group transferases.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3.3"><title>Methylation</title><p>GPAs
can be modified by SAM-dependent <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferases
that cap the amino terminus of Leu<sub>1</sub> of the vancomycin class
antibiotics. MtfA from the chloroeremomycin
cluster is a well-studied example representing the group. The crystal
structure of MtfA reveals that the protein exists as a dimer with
wing-like extensions and the GPA substrate is proposed to bind in
the cleft located at the dimer interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> Furthermore, MtfA has some substrate elasticity and can modify the <italic>N</italic>-terminal Hpg<sub>1</sub> of teicoplanin-class antibiotics.
Other variants of this protein exist; for example, M43A is a vancomycin
analogue from <italic>Amycolatopsis orientalis</italic>, which differs
from the parent molecule in trimethylation of Leu<sub>1</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> We have recently identified a methyltransferase
in the pekiskomycin cluster that adds two methyl groups to the amino-terminus
of the heptapeptide. Ristocetin is decorated by two methyl groups
at different positions: one is an unusual C-methylation at the <italic>para</italic> position of the phenol ring of Dpg<sub>3</sub>, and
the other is on the carboxyl group of Dpg<sub>7</sub> forming a methyl
ester. An orthologuous methyltransferase is also found in the VEG
cluster obtained from an environmental metagenome study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The cosmid when expressed in <italic>S. toyocaensis</italic> conferred methylation of the carboxy terminus of A47934.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> This chemical modification resulted in improvement
of the MIC of the GPA against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>. This demonstrates that even modest
alteration to the molecule indeed can increase antibiotic efficacy.
It is noteworthy that dalbavancin (Zeven), a semisynthetic GPA currently
in phase III clinical trials, also includes an aliphatic tail at the
C-terminus of the scaffold heptapeptide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec1.3.4"><title>Glycosylation</title><p>Sugar derivatization is the most studied
GPA tailoring mechanism. The spectrum of glycosylation ranges from
the aglycone antibiotic A47934 to ristocetin, which bears a six-sugared
scaffold. The addition of carbohydrate has been implicated in imparting
solubility and structural rigidity, as well as impacting the antibiotic
activity of GPAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> It is noteworthy that even though the glycosyltransferases
provide the broadest chemical diversity to the scaffold, they exhibit
rather modest versatility in their choice for amino acid on the GPA.
All of the sugar modifying enzymes identified so far act on one of
amino acids 4, 6, or 7 of the heptapeptide. The phenolic OH of Hpg<sub>4</sub> serves as the &#x0201c;hot seat&#x0201d; for loading sugar
moieties on GPAs; this reflects its relative availability for modification
given its spatial separation from the acyl-<sc>d</sc>-alanyl-<sc>d</sc>-alanine binding region of the antibiotic as well as the role that
sugars at this position play in back-to-back dimerization. The glucosyltransferases
in the chloroeremomycin (GtfB), vancomycin (GtfE), and balhimycin
(bGtfB) clusters transfer glucose from the nucleoside diphosphosugar
(dTDP-<sc>d</sc>-glucose) to the phenolic hydroxyl of Hpg<sub>4</sub>. The crystal structure for GtfB has been solved and provides insights
into the sugar and aglycone substrate binding sites, creating possibilities
for remodeling the protein for different sugar or substrate binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> The substrate promiscuity of GtfE with variant
heptapeptide aglycones has been demonstrated. The <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have identified the elasticity of GtfE in recognizing variant
aglycons and utilizing over 30 natural as well as synthetic sugar
residues including the aminosugars on vancomycin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup> The aminosugars present an independent
platform for further secondary modifications either naturally (e.g.,
acylation in teicoplanin) or by semisynthetic derivatization (e.g.,
alkylation in oritavancin) for improved GPA activity. Thus, glycosylation
serves as an excellent example of the potential of synthetic biology
in harnessing these enzymes in creating diverse GPA libraries.</p><p>The four-ringed heptapeptide scaffolds of UK68597 and ristocetin
are also glucosylated at Hpg<sub>4</sub>, whereas teicoplanin (GtfB)
and A40926 (Dbv9) have a GlcNAc moiety at Hpg<sub>4</sub>. The biosynthetic
clusters of the latter two, along with ristocetin, also include a
mannosyltransferase that modifies Dpg<sub>7</sub> with a mannose.
The most unusual sugars associated with GPAs modify the &#x003b2;-hydroxyl
of Bht<sub>6</sub>. In teicoplanin biosynthesis modification of the
position is catalyzed by a glycosyltransferase (Orf1) that attaches
a GlcNAc moiety. A customized sugar, 4-<italic>epi</italic>-<sc>l</sc>-vancosamine, adorns the Bht<sub>6</sub> in chloroeremomycin. A set
of five dedicated enzymes are required to mature a putative substrate
TDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose in a series of steps involving C2 deoxygenation
(EvaA), C3 amination (EvaB), C3 methylation (EvaC), and C5 epimerization
(EvaD) followed by C4 ketoreduction (EvaE) to form 4-<italic>epi</italic>-vancosamine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> An intermediate form of
this sugar, <sc>l</sc>-dehydrovancosamine, decorates the sixth amino
acid in balhimycin. This is due to a nonfunctional DvaE (EvaE) in
the balhimycin cluster required for the final maturation of the sugar.
Another variant of 4-<italic>epi</italic>-vancosamine, observed in
the form of ristosamine, is present on the ristocetin Bht<sub>6</sub>. The lack of a C3 methyl group on ristosamine suggests that the
producer might not have a functional EvaC homologue. A40926 and vancomycin
molecules are devoid of any sugar at Bht<sub>6</sub>, a key feature
differentiating them from similar GPAs chloroeremomycin and teicoplanin,
respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>GPA Secondary Modifications</title><p>All
of the secondary tailoring
enzymes identified so far act on the sugar linked to Hpg<sub>4</sub> of the backbone. The modifications such as the methyltransferases
(EvaC, DvaC) and the aminotransferases (EvaB, DvaB) involved in maturation
of vancosamine and its analogues in vancomycin, chloroeremomycin,
balhimycin, and ristocetin do not qualify as secondary modifications
since these modifications occur independently toward maturation of
the sugar, before it is attached to the GPA backbone. In teicoplanin
and A40926 the primary sugar GlcNAc undergoes deacetylation mediated
by Orf2* and Dbv21, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> This
modification paves the way for an acyltransferase to add an acyl chain
on the glucosamine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> The acyltransferase
is promiscuous in recognizing and loading different acyl chains, thereby
generating many natural variants. Teicoplanin is clinically used as
a mixture of five molecules with acyl tails of varying lengths (C10&#x02013;C11),
and four more forms have been identified as related substances produced
in relatively minor amounts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> The lipophilic
nature of the aliphatic tail has been suggested to impart superior
pharmacokinetic profile to teicoplanin.</p><p>The crystal structures
solved for two deacetylases (Orf2* and Dbv21) show a unique capping
loop involved in substrate binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> Recently
the crystal structure of Orf2* bound to teicoplanin has also been
solved, revealing a cavity lined by hydrophobic residues that can
host the long aliphatic acyl chain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> Furthermore,
the enzyme also shows a higher affinity and specificity for long chain
carbons compared to C2. This explains the role of Orf2*as a deacylase
shown previously in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. In A40926 biosynthetic
pathway sugar oxidation by a hexose oxidase (Dbv29) is an additional
modification that oxidizes C6 of the <italic>N</italic>-acylglucosaminyl
substituent to <italic>N</italic>-acylglucuronic acid. The minor change
serves as a block and safeguards the molecule from any further deacylation
attack by Dbv21 in A40926, which was observed in teicoplanin. Interestingly,
during recent structure determination studies of the flavin-containing
hexose oxidase (Dbv29), Li et al. serendipitously discovered a solvent-exposed
reaction intermediate that they cleverly used in generating a series
of teicoplanin analogues with amidated and aminated lipid chains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> Some of these derivatives showed excellent activity
against vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains. This provides yet another example of small chemical modifications
to the molecule yielding major impact in antibiotic improvement.</p><p>Another common secondary modification is glycosylation, again confined
only to the primary sugar (invariably a glucose) on Hpg<sub>4</sub>. A vancosamine sugar is added on the hexose of the pseudoaglycone
vancomycin by GtfD, to form vancomycin. The same modification is also
observed in UK68597, whereas chloroeremomycin glycosyltransferase
(GtfC) transfers 4-<italic>epi</italic>-vancosamine on the glucose.
Ristocetin has a crown of three different sugars attached to the primary
glucose. Two putative glycosyltransferases attach a rhamnose and a
mannose to the glucose moiety. A third glycosyltransferase attaches
an arabinose to the mannose. It is not known if the two sugars are
assembled before loading on the GPA or act in a stepwise fashion as
in case of other secondary sugars. The crystal structure of the vancosamyl
transferase GtfD has been solved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> Walsh
et al. have shown that the enzyme can recognize alternate primary
sugar substrates attached to Hpg<sub>4</sub> creating several variants
of the disaccharides including a 4-<italic>epi</italic>-vancosaminyl-4-aminoglucosyl
moiety on the vancomycin backbone. The availability of two nucleophilic
amino handles (one on each sugar) creates new opportunity for testing
addition of functional groups (e.g., acylation) to create semisynthetic
GPAs with potential better pathogen susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5"><title>GPA Production
Chassis</title><p>A fundamental requirement for
successful application of synthetic biology to GPA assembly is the
need for a robust platform for production. Most of the efforts to
expand GPA chemical diversity have so far involved <italic>in vitro</italic> or synthetic approaches. These serve as important tools in developing
good leads but are limited in the ability to be scaled up. Thus it
is essential to develop a robust chassis on which the new GPA molecules
can be constructed.</p><p>The concept of a versatile host system has
evolved gradually over the decades. After the Golden Era of antibiotics,
when new antibiotics were hard to find and sufficient genetic understanding
and tools were available, the first foray in the development of &#x0201c;hybrid&#x0201d;
antibiotics was reported by Hopwood and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> The use of combinatorial biosynthesis was rapidly adapted
to create libraries of unnatural natural products. Methods for heterologous
transfer of large clusters on multiple cosmids using recombination
techniques were also evolved. Most of the early work was done using
the well-characterized model system of <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> as the host. The constraint with this blue pigment (actinorhodin)
producer was a very high pigment background that often masked the
production of new compounds and siphoned off precursor elements necessary
for expression of heterologous pathways. Alternative strains including <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces albus</italic> that showed fewer background host secondary metabolites and receptiveness
for foreign DNA were successfully employed. The CH999 strain of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, with most of the actinorhodin cluster removed,
was among the first designer strains developed as a &#x0201c;clean&#x0201d;
host dedicated for expression of foreign natural product clusters.
Several tools and techniques have been evolved or adapted (such as <italic>E. coli-Streptomyces</italic> artificial chromosomes, Transformation
Associated Recombination, ReDirect technology among others)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> over the years that benefit the process. During this time, a phenomenal
accomplishment was achieved when the Khosla group and colleagues at
Kosan successfully expressed the genes necessary for the biosynthesis
of the erythromycin polyketide scaffold (6-deoxyerythronolide) from <italic>Saccharopolyspora erythrea</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic>.
To achieve this, they reengineered the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain
and added appropriate promoters to the biosynthetic genes, which could
be readily identified by the host system. Genes for alternate substrates
required for building the polyketide, absent in <italic>E. coli</italic>, were also added.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> Various bacterial
host systems besides <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and <italic>E.
coli</italic> such as <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp., <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp., <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>, and others have been developed
over the years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref></sup> In the post genomics
era the enormous natural product wealth of the Actinomycetes has been
unleashed. It has opened the genome-wide view of strains and developed
patterns that reveal a relatively conserved essential genomic core
and dispensable arms with natural product pathways. On the basis of
such information and advances in molecular engineering, improved host
systems have been developed in recent years, including a genome minimized
strain of <italic>S. avermitilis</italic> where 1.4 Mb of the dispensable
genomic region has been removed to develop an efficient and versatile
host.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> The genome reduction channels metabolic
resources toward the production of heterologous molecules as was shown
with streptomycin and cephamycin C overproduction. Similarly the M1154
strain of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> has been developed by Bibb&#x02019;s
group at John Innes Centre, where the four major secondary metabolite
pathways (<italic>act</italic>, <italic>red</italic>, <italic>cdA</italic>, <italic>cpk</italic>) have been systematically deleted generating
a host with greater heterologous biosynthetic potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Further, mutations in <italic>rpoB</italic> and <italic>rpsL</italic> genes that stimulate secondary metabolite production
discovered by the Ochi group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref></sup> have also
been incorporated in this strain, further improving heterologous expression.
Another strain of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> devoid of all of
the 10 PKS and NRPS biosynthetic pathways in the strain, along with
900 kb subtelomeric DNA, has also been recently developed offering
yet more potential biosynthetic capacity as an efficient chassis for
synthetic biology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref></sup></p><p>In the current
scenario, the best available option for development
of a GPA synthetic biology platform is to build a genomic library
of a producer using one of the <italic>E. coli-Streptomyces</italic> artificial chromosomes (pPAC-S2, pSTREPTOBAC V, pSBAC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref></sup> The advantage of using such a system instead
of a cosmid vector lies in its capacity to carry large &#x0201c;payload&#x0201d;
(up to 300 kb) enough to accommodate virtually any bacterial natural
product biosynthetic apparatus in a single clone. Heterologous expression
of the entire cluster in one of the available Streptomyces hosts should
offer the opportunity to produce many different scaffolds and variants.
The resulting system serves as an optimal chassis on which a variety
of modifications can be designed using the toolbox of the ancillary
genes. These tailoring enzymes can be sourced by isolating new GPA
producers or from the environmental metagenomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Conclusions and
Caveats</title><p>A synthetic biology approach is an ideal strategy
for expansion
of the chemical diversity of many natural products. GPA antibiotics
in particular offer an optimal scaffold for this approach since the
necessary assembly lines are known and various tailoring enzymes have
been tested successfully in the manufacture of new derivatives. The
pioneering work done by the Baltz group at Eli Lilly some 15 years
ago anticipated this strategy and offers the first proof of principle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> By expressing the glycosyltransferases from
the chloroeremomycin producer <italic>Amycolatopsis orientalis</italic> in <italic>S. toyocaensis</italic> they for the first time showed
production of two hybrid GPAs in the form of glycosylated derivatives
of A47934. Our subsequent work has helped to decipher the biosynthetic
pathway of A47934 and has led to better understanding of the structure
and functioning of the ancillary proteins, especially sulfotransferases.
Furthermore, the creative exploration of environmental metagenomic
cosmid megalibraries as a source of novel tailoring enzymes has yielded
several novel GPA variants. Given the number of scaffolds, tailoring
enzymes, and the impact that various chemical modifications have on
antibiotic activity, a synthetic biology strategy can yield libraries
of GPAs suitable for screens for bioactivity.</p><p>Nevertheless,
there are some significant challenges to the routine
application of synthetic biology strategies in expanding natural product
diversity. Among them are difficulties in heterologous expression
of biosynthetic gene clusters, competing metabolic pathways that siphon
off precious precursors, unpredictable substrate specificity and/or
efficiency of tailoring enzymes, unknown specificity of efflux systems
to deliver new derivatives out of the cell, and the potential generation
of toxic compounds unable to be averted by associated resistance mechanisms.
Some of these difficulties may be insurmountable for some scaffolds;
however, there is reason to be hopeful that for many complex compounds
that are practically inaccessible by total synthesis methods synthetic
biology approaches offer a fresh strategy to explore new chemistry.</p><p>While natural products may have fallen out of favor in modern drug
and antibiotic discovery, the need for new medicines, the rich bioactivity
of these molecules, the dramatic advancements in our understanding
of natural product biosynthesis, and the resulting amenability of
the field to synthetic biology solutions are poised to relaunch a
new era in natural product-focused pharmaceuticals.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="NOTES-d2972e791-autogenerated" notes-type="conflict-of-interest"><p>The authors declare no
