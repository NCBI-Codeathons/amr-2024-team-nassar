This so-called two-component system plays a decisive role in the chemical defence of various plants. Here, we discovered that <italic>Panax notoginseng</italic>, a valuable medicinal plant, has evolved a two-component chemical defence system composed of a chloroplast-localized <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucosidase, denominated PnGH1, and its substrates 20(<italic>S</italic>)-protopanaxadiol ginsenosides. The <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucosidase and its substrates are spatially separated in cells under physiological conditions, and ginsenoside hydrolysis is therefore activated only upon chloroplast disruption, which is caused by the induced exoenzymes of pathogenic fungi upon exposure to plant leaves. This activation of PnGH1-mediated hydrolysis results in the production of a series of less-polar ginsenosides by selective hydrolysis of an outer glucose at the C-3 site, with a broader spectrum and more potent antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo than the precursor molecules. Furthermore, such <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucosidase-mediated hydrolysis upon fungal infection was also found in the congeneric species <italic>P. quinquefolium</italic> and <italic>P. ginseng</italic>.

These defensive metabolites can be classified into two broad categories: constitutive defence metabolites (phytoanticipins), which act directly on pathogens or herbivores, and inducible defence compounds (phytoalexins), which are specifically produced in response to aggressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Compared with constitutive defence, inducible defence is more energetically economical and plays an essential role in plant chemical defence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The specialized metabolites in inducible defence are usually toxic to the plant, pathogens, or herbivores. Accordingly, plants have evolved two-component chemical defence systems that prevent autotoxicity to help balance plant growth and defence needs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. For instance, defence compounds are often stored in a non-active glycosylated form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In addition to protecting plants from autotoxicity, glycosylation increases the solubility of defence compounds, thereby facilitating their storage, typically in vacuoles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Upon plant cell damage caused by herbivory or pathogen invasion, glycosylated compounds can be selectively hydrolyzed at glycosidic linkages, yielding toxic defence compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glycosidase, which is spatially separated from its substrates under physiological conditions but encounters them upon tissue damage. Thus, this two-component chemical defence system comprises glycosylated defence compounds and corresponding <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glycosidases and provides an immediate chemical response against herbivores or pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glycosidases have been shown to play a decisive role in the chemical defence of various plants, these enzymes have not yet been reported in <italic>Panax</italic> species.</p><p id="Par4">The genus <italic>Panax</italic> in the taxonomic family Araliaceae encompasses several important ginseng species with high medicinal and economic value, including <italic>Panax notoginseng</italic> (Burk.) F.H. Chen (Notoginseng), <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> C.A. Mey (Asian Ginseng) and <italic>Panax quinquefolium</italic> L. (American Ginseng)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The cultivation of <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> is primarily restricted to southern China; the roots of this species are highly valued for their use in the prevention and treatment of diverse hematological diseases and ischemic cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> is highly sensitive to sunlight and requires shady, warm, damp environments for growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These stringent requirements for cultivation and long harvest cycles increase the vulnerability of the plant to pathogen infection. Over 20 foliar and root diseases that affect <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> growth have been identified, including round spots caused by <italic>Mycocentrospora acerina</italic>, black spots caused by <italic>Alternaria panax</italic>, and rotten roots caused by <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. These fungal diseases greatly threaten the quality and production of <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> and severely hinder the sustainable development of its industry. During evolution, <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> deploys an enormous array of specialized secondary metabolites that help them solve pathogen attacks. Dammarane triterpenoid saponins with 20(<italic>S</italic>)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) and 20(<italic>S</italic>)-protopanaxatriol (PPT) aglycon moieties, referred to as ginsenosides, perform defensive functions in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and are also the main pharmacological components of <italic>P. notoginseng</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These ginsenosides are distributed in various parts of <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> plants, such as rhizomes, roots, leaves, inflorescences, and infructescences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The ginsenosides Rc, Rb2, and Rb3, classified as the PPD type ginsenosides, are the main chemical components of <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> leaves (PNLs) but are present at trace levels in the roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Our previous studies have shown that the main ginsenosides in PNLs, which have a common <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-1,2-glucosidic linkage at the C-3 site, can be entirely hydrolyzed to form corresponding rare ginsenosides by selectively removing one outer glucose residue during ultrasonic extraction in water, and this ginsenoside hydrolysis has been speculatively attributed to a ginsenoside-hydrolyzing glucosidase present in PNLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucosidase responsible for this reaction and its role in plant chemical defence is largely unknown.</p><p id="Par5">Herein, we provide evidence demonstrating the existence of a two-component chemical defence system in <italic>P. notoginseng</italic>. PnGH1, a <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucosidase localized to the chloroplast, was discovered to specifically hydrolyze PPD ginsenosides in PNLs by selectively removing one outer glucose residue at the C-3 site. Due to spatial separation between <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucosidase and its substrates in cells, ginsenoside hydrolysis was triggered only upon chloroplast disruption caused by the induced exoenzymes of pathogens. Compared to the non-hydrolyzed substrates, the hydrolysis products exhibited more potent inhibition of pathogen growth both in vitro and in vivo. Similar <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucosidase-mediated ginsenoside hydrolysis was found in congeneric species upon fungal infection, including in <italic>P. ginseng</italic> and <italic>P. quinquefolium</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Localized ginsenoside hydrolysis occurs in the lesion area of <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> leaves with round spot disease in open field</title><p id="Par6">Round spot caused by the necrotrophic fungus <italic>M. acerina</italic> is a primary foliar disease occurring in cultured <italic>P. notoginseng</italic>. Given its high prevalence and severe consequences, we investigated chemical changes of specialized metabolites in PNLs with round spot disease collected from the open field. Specifically, different zones (illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) of infected leaves from a single <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> plant were harvested for chemical analysis by LC-UV, including analysis of the lesion area (Zone I), a healthy area of the same leaf (Zone II), and a healthy area of a neighboring leaf (Zone III). Surprisingly, the chemical profile of the lesion tissue was clearly different from those of the other two zones and healthy leaves from a non-infected plant (CON) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The main components identified in healthy leaves and lesion tissue were designated compounds <bold>1&#x02013;4</bold> and <bold>1a&#x02013;4a</bold>, respectively, by the aid of their reference standards and LC&#x02013;MS analysis. The most plausible explanation for these differences is that ginsenoside hydrolysis might occur locally in the lesion tissue of PNLs with round spot disease. Specifically, ginsenosides Rb1 (<bold>1</bold>), Rc (<bold>2</bold>), Rb2 (<bold>3</bold>) and Rb3 (<bold>4</bold>), the main components of PNLs, were hydrolyzed to gypenoside XVII (<bold>1a</bold>), notoginsenoside Fe (<bold>2a</bold>), ginsenoside Rd2 (<bold>3a</bold>), and notoginsenoside Fd (<bold>4a</bold>), respectively, via the selective hydrolysis of an outer glucose from the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> (1&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;2)-glycosidic linkage at C-3 without cleavage of other glycosidic linkages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In contrast, Fc (<bold>5</bold>) conjugated with a Glu-Glu-Xyl carbohydrate chain at C-3 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) was not hydrolyzed. Furthermore, to quantitatively characterize the hydrolysis process in PNLs under various stresses, the ratios of Fd to Rb3&#x02009;+&#x02009;Fd and Fe to Rc&#x02009;+&#x02009;Fe were defined as the hydrolysis turnover. Rb3 (<bold>4</bold>) and Rc (<bold>2</bold>) were the most abundant and second most abundant ginsenosides in PNLs, and their hydrolysis products were Fd (<bold>4a</bold>) and Fe (<bold>2a</bold>), respectively. As a result, the hydrolysis turnovers in Zone I of PNLs with round spot disease were significantly higher than those in other zones and the leaves of noninfected plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Localized ginsenoside hydrolysis occurs in the lesion area of <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> leaves with round spot disease in open field.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Different zone of the infected PNL was harvested for chemical analysis.

In our study, the first indication that PPD-type ginsenosides have defensive properties against fungal infection was that ginsenoside hydrolysis was localized to the decayed tissue of PNLs with round spot disease. These findings were also confirmed in <italic>M. acerina</italic>-inoculated PNLs in the greenhouse. Nevertheless, a small quantity of hydrolysis products was detected in the leaves of non-infected plants and healthy tissue in the same and neighboring leaves, indicating that other unidentified factors or stresses might also cause mild ginsenoside hydrolysis in healthy PNLs under highly complex open-field conditions. However, upon fungal infection, intact ginsenosides are largely hydrolyzed in the decayed tissue of the PNLs. We further revealed that ginsenoside hydrolysis is a stress type-specific response associated with infection by pathogenic fungi, but absent in non-pathogenic fungal infection and designed abiotic stress. Dynamic chemical changes during fungal infection indicated that the molar amounts of the hydrolysis products in decayed PNLs increased dramatically, with increases ranging from 2.2-fold to 7.8-fold, suggesting that ginsenoside biosynthesis is enhanced to produce greater amounts of the hydrolysis products upon fungal infection. Fd, with the strongest antifungal activity, showed the most significant enrichment during the infection process.
