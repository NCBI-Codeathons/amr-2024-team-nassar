To identify the detailed function of zinc in fungal pathogenicity, we carried out cDNA microarray analysis using the model system of <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, a fungal pathogen. From microarray analysis, we found that the genes involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis were upregulated when zinc was depleted, and the microarray data were confirmed by northern blot analysis. In particular, zinc deficiency upregulated the expression of <italic>GliZ</italic>, which encodes a Zn2-Cys6 binuclear transcription factor that regulates the expression of the genes required for gliotoxin biosynthesis. The production of gliotoxin was decreased in a manner inversely proportional to the zinc concentration, and the same result was investigated in the absence of <italic>ZafA</italic>, which is a zinc-dependent transcription activator. Interestingly, we found two conserved ZafA-binding motifs, 5&#x02032;-CAAGGT-3&#x02032;, in the upstream region of <italic>GliZ</italic> on the genome and discovered that deletion of the <italic>ZafA</italic>-binding motifs resulted in loss of ZafA-binding activity; gliotoxin production was decreased dramatically, as demonstrated with a <italic>GliZ</italic> deletion mutant. Furthermore, mutation of the ZafA-binding motifs resulted in an increase in the conidial killing activity of human macrophage and neutrophil cells, and virulence was decreased in a murine model. Finally, transcriptomic analysis revealed that the expression of <italic>ZafA</italic> and <italic>GliZ</italic> was upregulated during phagocytosis by macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that zinc plays an important role in the pathogenicity of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> by regulating gliotoxin production during the phagocytosis pathway to overcome the host defense system.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Zinc</kwd><kwd>gliotoxin</kwd><kwd><italic>ZafA</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>GliZ</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>A. fumigatus</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-20-06192"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Iron, copper, and zinc are representative essential trace elements and perform many physiological roles in living organisms. The function of iron, copper, and zinc in living cells has been studied in various model organisms. Iron is an essential metal ion that works as a cofactor of many enzymes, and iron deficiency results in fatal diseases, such as hereditary anemia [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. On the other hand, iron overload induces the so-called Fenton reaction, which mediates the production of hydroxyl radicals and is fatal to living cells by affecting DNA and proteins [<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For this reason, iron homeostasis is strictly regulated. Copper also carries out many important roles in living organisms, and copper deficiency or overload causes severe genetic diseases, such as Menkes disease or Wilson disease [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], respectively. Zinc deficiency also causes several diseases, such as impaired immune function, growth defects, and psychological disorders in humans [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Iron, copper, and zinc are divalent metal ions that carry out oxidoreduction reactions and produce reactive oxygen species that affect cellular activity.</p><p>These three metals also have important functions in the pathogenesis of microbial pathogens, and most of the gene products involved in metal metabolism work as virulence factors [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Loss of the uptake systems for these metals in microbial pathogens results in loss of virulence, and this phenomenon is observed in many different microbial pathogens, such as <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> [<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and <italic>Neisseria</italic> spp. [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. When microbial pathogens infect a host, competition for metal acquisition between the host and pathogens occurs. For example, when infecting a host, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> is confronted with macrophage phagocytosis, and zinc is depleted by the host zinc transporter system during the phagocytic pathway [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Microbial pathogens cannot use zinc from the environment and fail to grow in macrophages [<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, we tried to further identify the detailed role of zinc in the pathogenicity of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>.</p><p>Zinc exists as a variety of forms and acts as a cofactor in many proteins, such as transcriptional factors, metallothioneins, and various zinc-binding proteins [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, which is a fungal pathogen, needs zinc to carry out physiological functions. Zinc uptake by <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> depends on the ZIP (Zrt-, Irt-like proteins) family encoded by <italic>ZrfA</italic>, <italic>ZrfB</italic>, and <italic>ZrfC</italic> [<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Zinc transporters efficiently take up zinc in zinc-limiting conditions from the extracellular environment into the cytoplasm. ZrfC functions as a major zinc transporter because of its unusually long N-terminus, whereas ZrfA and ZrfB seem to play an accessory role [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>ZrfC</italic> is higher in alkaline conditions than in acidic environments, while the <italic>ZrfA</italic> and <italic>ZrfB</italic> expression patterns are opposite to that of <italic>ZrfC</italic> [<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. ZafA is a zinc-responsive transcriptional activator and is an ortholog of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Zap1 transcription factor [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In acidic conditions, ZafA binds to the promoter regions of <italic>ZrfA</italic> and <italic>ZrfB</italic>, whereas in alkaline media, ZafA binds to the <italic>ZrfC</italic> promoter region and activates the expression of those genes [<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Recently, it has been reported that metals control the production of secondary metabolites of fungal species, which act as virulence factors of microbial pathogens [<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Secondary metabolites are produced by microorganisms, and they perform a protective function against the host [<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For example, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> produces several secondary metabolites that are most likely involved in invasive aspergillosis [<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis has been studied in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, and LaeA, which is a transcriptional activator, has an important function in secondary metabolite production, such as that of melanin, ergot alkaloids, and gliotoxin [<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The genes involved in secondary metabolites are clustered in the genome, and gene expression is regulated by LaeA [<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Gliotoxin is one of the secondary metabolites produced by <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. Gliotoxin is a nonribosomal peptide and a member of the epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) class of redox-active secondary metabolites naturally produced by <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and is one of its virulence factors. It contains a disulfide bond bridge across a piperazine ring that seems to be responsible for its toxicity [<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, gliotoxin is encoded by a cluster composed of 13 genes, namely, <italic>GliZ</italic>, <italic>GliI</italic>, <italic>GliJ</italic>, <italic>GliP</italic>, <italic>GliC</italic>, <italic>GliM</italic>, <italic>GliG</italic>, <italic>GliK</italic>, <italic>GliA</italic>, <italic>GliN</italic>, <italic>GliF</italic>, <italic>GliT</italic>, and a separate <italic>GtmA</italic> gene. It is well known that gliotoxin has multiple immunosuppressive activities and inhibits the nuclear transcription factor NF-kB, especially inducing host cell apoptosis [<xref rid="B32-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that gliotoxin can inhibit macrophage functions, including phagocytosis [<xref rid="B34-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, it has been reported that the production of gliotoxin is regulated by zinc availability [<xref rid="B35-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and that the gene expression of <italic>GliZ</italic> is upregulated by zinc starvation; however, the detailed regulatory mechanism remains to be solved [<xref rid="B35-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this paper, we demonstrate the detailed regulatory mechanism of gliotoxin biosynthesis by zinc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-20-06192"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-20-06192"><title>2.1. Genes Involved in Gliotoxin Production are Downregulated by Zinc</title><p>To understand the regulation of global gene expression by zinc in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, cDNA microarray analysis was performed. The cells were cultured in AMM-zinc plus 1 &#x000b5;M zinc and standard AMM to exponential phase, and total RNA was extracted. Standard AMM contains 77 &#x000b5;M zinc in the medium. We found that many genes involved in cellular metabolism were down- or upregulated by zinc. Among them, we found that the genes involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis were upregulated under zinc-deficient conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f001">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>GliZ</italic>, <italic>GliA</italic>, <italic>GliT</italic>, and <italic>GtmA</italic> were upregulated under zinc-deficient conditions, and other genes were not detected in this experiment because of low expression levels. To confirm the cDNA microarray data, northern blot analysis was performed. The cells were cultured in AMM-zinc medium with 0 to 2 &#x000b5;M zinc, and total RNA was extracted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, the expression of <italic>GliZ</italic>, <italic>GliA</italic>, <italic>GliT</italic>, and <italic>GtmA</italic> was downregulated in a manner inversely proportional to the zinc concentration, and these results coincided with the microarray data. GliZ is a Zn2-Cys6 binuclear transcription factor that positively regulates gene expression involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of <italic>GliZ</italic> gene expression by zinc, a <italic>ZafA</italic> deletion mutant was constructed, and the expression of the genes involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis was investigated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, the <italic>ZafA</italic> deletion mutant showed a growth defect in low-zinc and standard AMM media, and supplementation with zinc rescued the growth defect of the <italic>&#x00394;zafA</italic> strain. Additionally, the introduction of <italic>ZafA</italic> into the <italic>&#x00394;zafA</italic> strain rescued the growth defect of the <italic>&#x00394;zafA</italic> strain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f002">Figure 2</xref>B, northern blot analysis was performed with <italic>&#x00394;zafA</italic> and <italic>ZafA</italic>-complemented strains. Each strain was cultured until the exponential phase, and total RNA was extracted. The gene expression of <italic>GliZ</italic>, <italic>GliT, GliA</italic>, and other <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes were decreased dramatically when <italic>ZafA</italic> was deleted, and the introduction of <italic>ZafA</italic> to the <italic>&#x00394;zafA</italic> strain rescued the expression of <italic>GliZ</italic>, <italic>GliT, GliA</italic>, and other <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes. Furthermore, <italic>GliM</italic>, <italic>GliA</italic>, <italic>GliT</italic> and <italic>GliA</italic> gene expression was not detected in the <italic>GliZ</italic> deletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). These data indicate that zinc regulates the expression of the genes involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis by regulating <italic>GliZ</italic> expression.</p><p>To further investigate the regulatory mechanism of zinc on gliotoxin biosynthesis, gliotoxin production was measured from the cells of the wild type, <italic>ZafA</italic> deletion strain, and <italic>ZafA</italic>-complemented strain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, gliotoxin production was measured using HPLC, and extremely low production of gliotoxin was observed from the <italic>ZafA</italic> deletion strain (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-06192">Figure S1</xref>). However, the <italic>ZafA</italic>-complemented strain showed even higher gliotoxin production than the wild-type cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f002">Figure 2</xref>B, the <italic>ZafA</italic>-complemented strain showed higher expression of <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes and gliotoxin production than the wild-type cells, and these results are thought to be due to the presence of the <italic>pyrG</italic> as the selectable marker of the <italic>ZafA</italic>-complemented strain and activating the expression of target gene. To investigate the involvement of zinc in gliotoxin biosynthesis, gliotoxin production was measured from cells cultured with different zinc concentrations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, the cells were cultured with the indicated zinc concentration, and the produced gliotoxin was measured (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-06192">Figure S2</xref>). Interestingly, gliotoxin production was decreased in a manner inversely proportional to the zinc concentration, and this result coincided with the result of northern blot analysis, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f001">Figure 1</xref>B. The gliotoxin production from the <italic>GliZ</italic> deletion strain was measured (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-06192">Figure S3</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f003">Figure 3</xref>C.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-20-06192"><title>2.2. ZafA Binds to the Upstream Region of GliZ and Regulates Gliotoxin Biosynthesis</title><p>To identify the mechanism of ZafA regulation of <italic>GliZ</italic> expression, we looked for the conserved ZafA-binding motif [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in the upstream region of the <italic>GliZ</italic> gene. Interestingly, we found two conserved ZafA-binding motifs, 5&#x02032;-CAAGGT-3&#x02032;, from the &#x02212;850 and &#x02212;761 positions of the <italic>GliZ</italic> upstream region. To confirm the binding of ZafA to the ZafA-binding motifs of <italic>GliZ</italic>, mutagenesis was performed to remove the 5&#x02032;-CAAGGT-3&#x02032; ZafA-binding motif from the upstream region of <italic>GliZ</italic>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, and a mutant strain was constructed. The &#x02212;831-position mutant is M1, the &#x02212;785-position mutant is M2, and the strain with mutations at both the &#x02212;831 and &#x02212;785 positions is M1M2. Mutagenesis had no effect on growth, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f004">Figure 4</xref>B. To investigate the effect of ZafA on <italic>GliZ</italic> expression in vitro, an ONPG assay was performed using a beta-galactosidase-fused system. Each upstream region of <italic>GliZ</italic> wild type and each mutant, M1, M2, and M1M2, was fused with the beta-galactosidase gene and subcloned into the yeast vector pRS425. The constructed vectors were cotransformed into yeast cells with a <italic>ZafA</italic> plasmid that expressed ZafA protein in yeast cells. Then, beta-galactosidase activity was measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f004">Figure 4</xref>C, although the wild-type upstream region of <italic>GliZ</italic> showed high beta-galactosidase activity when <italic>ZafA</italic> was also expressed, the M1M2 mutant showed the lowest beta-galactosidase activity. These results indicate that ZafA binds specifically to the <italic>GliZ</italic> upstream region. To investigate the regulation of <italic>GliZ</italic> by ZafA, northern blot analysis was performed with the mutant strains M1, M2, and M1M2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f004">Figure 4</xref>D, the gene expression levels of <italic>GliZ</italic>, <italic>GliT</italic>, and <italic>GliA</italic> were downregulated in the M1M2 mutant, and this result showed the function of ZafA in gliotoxin biosynthesis.</p><p>To further confirm the function of ZafA in <italic>GliZ</italic> expression, an EMSA was performed. ZafA protein was purified using a His-tagged form of ZafA from <italic>E. coli</italic>, and overexpressed recombinant ZafA was used in the EMSA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f004">Figure 4</xref>E, the wild-type ZafA-binding motif and each mutant of <italic>GliZ</italic> were amplified and labeled with the <sup>32</sup>P radioisotope. The ZafA protein bound strongly to the wild-type ZafA-binding motif, and a mobility shift was observed. An unlabeled wild-type ZafA-binding motif competed with the labeled ZafA-binding motif, and the addition of 350-fold excess of the cold ZafA-binding motif completely inhibited the mobility shift. However, the M1 and M2 mutants partially failed to compete with the ZafA-binding motif, and M1M2 completely failed to compete with the ZafA-binding motif. Furthermore, we measured gliotoxin production using the M1 and M2 mutants (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-06192">Figure S4</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f004">Figure 4</xref>F, the indicated strains were cultured as described in the materials and methods section, and gliotoxin production was measured. Gliotoxin production was decreased when the ZafA-binding motif was mutated, and the M1M2 strain showed the lowest gliotoxin production, which coincided with the northern blot analyses, EMSAs, and ONPG assays. These results indicate that ZafA binds specifically to the ZafA-binding motifs of <italic>GliZ</italic> and regulates gene expression of <italic>GliZ</italic> and other <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes as well as ultimately regulating gliotoxin production.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-20-06192"><title>2.3.

To identify the involvement of ZafA binding to the ZafA-binding motifs of <italic>GliZ</italic> in the pathogenesis of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, we performed a conidial killing assay with human macrophage and neutrophil cell lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f005">Figure 5</xref>, wild-type cells and mutant cells were infected with the indicated cell lines. The HL-60 differentiated macrophage cell line [<xref rid="B37-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] was infected with wild-type and mutant strains, and a conidial killing assay was performed. M1 and M2 showed lower viability than wild type, and M1M2 showed the lowest viability among them. The same result was observed in the HL-60 differentiated neutrophil cell line [<xref rid="B38-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To further confirm virulence defects, a murine virulence assay was performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f005">Figure 5</xref>C, wild-type cells killed the mouse very quickly, and all mice died after 6 days of infection. However, M1M2 showed a substantially delayed death rate for which all mice died 12 days after fungal infection. The <italic>GliZ</italic> deletion mutant showed a death rate similar to that of the M1M2 mutant. To investigate fungal lung infection, a fungal burden assay was performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f005">Figure 5</xref>D, the negative control, which was not infected by <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, showed clear morphology in hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) staining, indicating that no fungal infection was present. However, GMS staining of the positive control, which was infected with wild-type cells, showed many fungal cells. In addition, the M1M2 and <italic>GliZ</italic> mutants did not show significant fungal cells from H&#x00026;E and GMS staining and were similar to the negative control.

To identify the involvement of ZafA in gliotoxin production during fungal infection of macrophages, RNA-seq analysis was performed using phagocytic cells of macrophages with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. After infection of macrophages with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> for 1 and 2 h, total RNA was extracted from the infected cells and RNA-seq analysis was performed. Zero infection time was the comparative control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f006">Figure 6</xref>A, transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of genes involved in metal metabolism and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was regulated and that the genes involved in zinc metabolism were upregulated specifically after infection. Interestingly, we found that <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes were also upregulated. To confirm the RNA-seq data, qRT-PCR was performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f006">Figure 6</xref>B, <italic>ZafA</italic> and three zinc transporters, <italic>ZrtA</italic>, <italic>ZrtB</italic>, and <italic>ZrtC</italic>, were upregulated after infection with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. <italic>GliZ</italic> and other <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes were also upregulated after infection. These data coincide with our previous in vitro data and indicate that zinc regulates the pathogenicity of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> during phagocytosis by regulating gliotoxin biosynthesis. Finally, we constructed transcriptome network modeling of the genes involved in zinc, copper, iron, and gliotoxin metabolism during the phagocytosis pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f006">Figure 6</xref>C, the genes involved in zinc, copper, iron, and gliotoxin metabolism were grouped individually, and up- and downregulated genes are shown. From the transcriptome network, we found that <italic>ZafA</italic> and <italic>GliZ</italic> were upregulated during phagocytosis and that copper- and iron-related genes were also upregulated. Here, we focused on the relationship between <italic>ZafA</italic> and <italic>GliZ</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f006">Figure 6</xref>C, the genes involved in zinc metabolism, such as <italic>ZafA</italic> and <italic>ZrfC</italic>, were upregulated. Furthermore, the genes involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis, such as GliZ and GliT, were upregulated. We hypothesized from our results that zinc starvation during phagocytosis upregulated <italic>ZafA</italic> first and then <italic>GliZ</italic>. Finally, gliotoxin biosynthesis was upregulated even when zinc depletion was caused by host cells. These data indicate that zinc regulates gliotoxin biosynthesis directly and that the involvement of other metals in secondary metabolite biosynthesis should be identified further.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-ijms-20-06192"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Metals have diverse physiological functions in living organisms, and their deficiency or abundance causes fatal diseases in humans. Therefore, metal homeostasis is strictly regulated in living organisms. Furthermore, metals play an important role in the pathogenicity of microbial pathogens, and the utilization of metals such as iron, copper, and zinc is a known virulence factor [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> is a saprophytic fungus that causes aspergillosis in humans. <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> has both a siderophore-mediated and a reductive iron uptake system for iron acquisition [<xref rid="B39-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and dysfunction of the siderophore-mediated iron uptake system results in failure to infect host cells [<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Deletion of the gene encoding <italic>SidA</italic>, which catalyzes siderophore biosynthesis, results in loss of virulence [<xref rid="B40-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Copper utilization ability is also a virulence factor in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. Our group identified the copper transporters, Ctr proteins, and the copper-dependent transcription activator AfMac1, and the deletion of <italic>Afmac1</italic> resulted in growth defects in low-copper concentrations and partial loss of virulence [<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, ZafA is a zinc-dependent transcription activator of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, and the deletion of <italic>ZafA</italic> also results in growth defects and loss of virulence [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These reports indicate that iron, copper, and zinc play important roles in the pathogenicity of microbial pathogens although their detailed mechanisms have not yet been identified, and elucidation of the detailed function of metals in pathogenicity is required.</p><p>Previously, we and other groups reported that Afmac1 regulates expression of the genes involved in several secondary metabolites, including siderophores, gli-like genes, and the metabolites of pyoverdine biosynthesis [<xref rid="B43-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been reported recently that PpzA, which is involved in iron assimilation, regulates secondary metabolite biosynthesis, such as that of pyripyropene, TAFC, and fumagillin, under iron starvation conditions [<xref rid="B44-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our data in this report show that ZafA regulates the gene expression of secondary metabolite-encoding genes, especially <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes. These reports indicate that metals regulate the gene expression of secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites are produced by most microorganisms and carry out diverse functions, such as protective functions against other living organisms, metal transport, differentiation, immunosuppression, and communication [<xref rid="B45-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In fungi, secondary metabolites, such as siderophores, antibiotics, and mycotoxins, have been studied. Generally, the genes encoding secondary metabolites in fungi are clustered in the genome, and genes for gliotoxin biosynthesis are also clustered in the genome [<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Some fungal secondary metabolites have been recognized as virulence factors [<xref rid="B46-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and gliotoxin is also recognized as a virulence factor of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> [<xref rid="B36-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Gliotoxin has been known as a virulence factor that causes invasive aspergillosis [<xref rid="B47-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], although the function of gliotoxin during pathogenesis remains to be solved. Gliotoxin can produce reactive oxygen species because of its disulfide structure [<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and it serves an immunosuppressive function by inactivating the host defense system [<xref rid="B48-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This immunosuppressive function of gliotoxin is involved in many different human diseases. As described previously, we and other groups reported that trace metals regulate secondary metabolite biosynthesis, but the reason why metals affect secondary metabolite production is not yet known. It has been reported that the expression of <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes is regulated by gliotoxin, abiotic factors, and the LaeA transcription factor. Gliotoxin biosynthesis is regulated by gliotoxin itself because none of the synthesized gliotoxins are secreted. The remaining cellular gliotoxin regulates the gene expression of <italic>GliZ</italic>, which is a transcription activator of <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes [<xref rid="B49-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Abiotic factors, such as pH, temperature, and aeration, of culture conditions affect the expression of <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes [<xref rid="B50-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. LaeA, which is a transcription factor, regulates many secondary metabolites, and gliotoxin is one of them [<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the detailed regulatory mechanism of gliotoxin gene expression has not yet been identified because these factors indirectly regulate the expression of <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes.</p><p>Our question is how trace metals regulate gliotoxin biosynthesis. As described previously, gliotoxin has immunosuppressive function, and this function may help <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infect host cells [<xref rid="B32-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, gliotoxin activity during phagocytosis plays an important role in overcoming the host defense system. When pathogens infect hosts, macrophages attack microbial pathogens by phagocytosis, and diverse host defense systems are engaged during phagocytosis [<xref rid="B53-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Metal limitation in macrophage cells is one of the host defense systems [<xref rid="B54-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Host cells pump metals outside of macrophages so that pathogens cannot use the metals. Metal limitation inhibits metal utilization by pathogens and inhibits the growth of pathogens [<xref rid="B54-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], ultimately resulting in a loss of virulence. In fact, effluxes of iron, copper, and zinc are observed in many phagocytic cells, and the expression of genes encoding metal transporters is upregulated during phagocytosis [<xref rid="B55-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. On the other hand, microbial pathogens compete with the host defense system to obtain metals from the environment. <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> upregulates the genes involved in the metal uptake system, and our results showed the upregulation of the genes encoding zinc transporters. In addition, upregulation of <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes during the phagocytosis pathway was observed. These data explain why zinc is involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis. Furthermore, it has been reported that zinc is necessary for gliotoxin biosynthesis and that zinc is used as a cofactor of GliJ, which encodes a dipeptidase, during gliotoxin biosynthesis [<xref rid="B56-ijms-20-06192" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>From our results, we hypothesize a relationship between metal and gliotoxin production during fungal infection. We identified the direct relationship between zinc and gliotoxin biosynthesis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f004">Figure 4</xref>, in which ZafA binds to the <italic>GliZ</italic> upstream region directly and regulates gliotoxin biosynthesis. This result provides data regarding the relationship between metals and secondary metabolites. We analyzed the gene expression pattern during phagocytosis, and the genes involved in zinc metabolism and gliotoxin biosynthesis were upregulated. This phenomenon results from metal restriction by the host and one of the pathogen defense systems. The expression profiles of the genes involved in zinc metabolism and gliotoxin biosynthesis are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06192-f006">Figure 6</xref>C, and we further identified a relationship between <italic>ZafA</italic> and <italic>GliZ</italic>. When pathogens infect the host, zinc limitation occurs inside the host cells, and pathogens upregulate the genes involved in zinc metabolism. ZafA is upregulated and then upregulates the genes for gliotoxin biosynthesis. Finally, gliotoxin plays an important role in the pathogenesis pathway. The relationship between zinc and gliotoxin is linked by the zinc-responsive transcription factor ZafA. Our data showed the function of metals in regulating secondary metabolite biosynthesis and suggests a possibility for effectively carrying out pathogen control by controlling metal metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-20-06192"><title>4.

Cells were washed with 1&#x000d7; PBS and harvested in 1&#x000d7; PBS. The samples were then centrifuged at 250&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. Then, total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Invitrogen, Seoul, Korea), and cDNA was synthesized by using a TOPscript&#x02122; cDNA synthesis kit (Enzynomics, Seoul, Korea). qRT-PCR was performed by using KAPA SYBR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for LightCycler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 480.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot12-ijms-20-06192"><title>4.12. RNA Sequencing</title><p>The total RNA extraction protocol from macrophages and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> was described in the real-time PCR (see materials and methods section). RNA quality was assessed by an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer using an RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, the Netherlands), and RNA quantification was performed using an ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Inc., Delaware, USA). Libraries were prepared from 2 &#x000b5;g of total RNA using the SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., California, USA). Isolation of mRNA was performed using a poly(A) RNA selection kit (LEXOGEN, Inc., Wien, Austria). The isolated mRNAs were used for cDNA synthesis and shearing, following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Indexing was performed using the Illumina indexes 1&#x02013;12. An enrichment step was carried out using PCR. Subsequently, libraries were checked using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (DNA High Sensitivity Kit) to evaluate the mean fragment size. Quantification was performed using the library quantification kit with the StepOne real-time PCR system (Life Technologies, Inc., California, USA). High-throughput sequencing was performed as paired-end 100 bp sequencing using a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, Inc., California, USA). mRNA-seq reads were mapped using the TopHat software tool to obtain an alignment file. The alignment files were also used for assembling transcripts, estimating their abundances, and detecting differential expression of genes and isoforms using cufflinks. We used the fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments (FPKM) as the method of determining the expression level of the gene regions. The FPKM data were normalized based on the quantile normalization method using EdgeR within R. The RNA-seq data have been deposited in NCBI&#x02019;s Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE135818 (<uri xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135818">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135818</uri>). The network model was built using the Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) App in Cytoscape software 3.7.0. The lists of the genes involved in the homeostasis of iron, copper, and zinc and the genes involved in gliotoxin biosynthesis from <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> genome were obtained from the web-based Gene Ontology browser (quickGO). The data analysis program we used was STRING:Protein Query and species was <italic>A.fumigatus</italic>. The confidence cutoff value was 0.4 and maximum additional interactors was 0. The expression level of proteins was represented by adding the log<sub>2</sub> value to the fold change, comparing the values of mRNA expression level when zinc concentration was 0 and 1 uM. Proteins that did not show any interaction were not shown in the figure. The red dash line that we added represents the direct interaction of the ZafA protein to the <italic>GliZ</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot13-ijms-20-06192"><title>4.13. Mouse Virulence Assay</title><p>Wild-type <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and mutants were spotted on AMM agar plates and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 5 days. Spores were harvested with a 0.9% NaCl solution containing 0.01% Tween 80 and filtered with Miracloth. The number of spores was counted with a hemocytometer (Marienfeld) to produce a concentration of 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> spores/mL. BALB/c mice were purchased from Orientbio Co. The number of mice used in each experimental group was six, and all of the mice were six weeks old. They were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg body weight) on days &#x02013;3, &#x02013;1, +2 and every subsequent third day throughout the whole experimental period and with cortisone acetate (112.5 mg/kg body weight) on day &#x02013;1. They were allowed free access to their food and 1 g/L tetracycline hydrochloride-supplemented drinking water. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> spores (20 &#x000b5;L) were nasally infected per mouse. After the infection, the mouse survival rate was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot14-ijms-20-06192"><title>4.14.

Conclusions</title><p>The production of gliotoxin was regulated by ZafA, which is a zinc-dependent transcription activator. Two conserved ZafA-binding motifs, 5&#x02019;-CAAGGT-3&#x02019;, in the upstream region of GliZ gene influence to the gliotoxin production. These ZafA-binding motifs were also associated with virulence of Aspergillus fumigatus. Taken together, these results suggest that zinc plays an important role in the pathogenicity of A. fumigatus by regulating gliotoxin production during the phagocytosis pathway to overcome the host defense system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea for supporting this research.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-ijms-20-06192"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>Supplementary materials can be found at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/24/6192/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/24/6192/s1</uri>. </p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ijms-20-06192-s001"><media xlink:href="ijms-20-06192-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>H.S. performed most experiments.

The number of mice used in each experimental group was six, and all of the mice were six weeks old. Curves were plotted by using GraphPad Prism software. The <italic>p</italic>-value was 0.0006. (<bold>D</bold>) A fungal burden assay was performed. The mice infected with conidia of the wild-type or mutant strains were sacrificed, and the mouse lungs were dissected after 3 days of infection, fixed in 10% formalin, and then embedded in paraffin. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) staining were performed. NC and PC indicate negative and positive controls, respectively. GMS staining quantification was performed using &#x0201c;Image J&#x0201d; program. We transformed images into RGB stack files, and their GMS % area was measured as signals respectively. The samples including wild type, M1M2, and <italic>gliZ</italic> mutants were compared respectively based on the signal of negative control (= 1). * <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, ** <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ijms-20-06192-g005a"/><graphic xlink:href="ijms-20-06192-g005b"/></fig><fig id="ijms-20-06192-f006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Zinc-related and <italic>gli</italic> cluster genes were upregulated during phagocytosis.

High-throughput sequencing was performed as paired-end 100 bp sequencing using a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, Inc., USA). mRNA-seq reads were mapped using the TopHat software tool to obtain an alignment file. (<bold>B</bold>) Total RNA was extracted from the phagocytic cells infected with conidia after 0 and 1 h postinfection, and cDNA was synthesized using a TOPscript&#x02122; cDNA synthesis kit (Enzynomics). Then, qRT-PCR was performed using KAPA SYBR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for LightCycler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 480 with the primer sets for the indicated genes. (<bold>C</bold>) The transcriptomic profile during phagocytosis is shown. The gene expression profile was grouped into zinc, copper, iron, and gliotoxin metabolism. Upregulated genes were found in all categories, and <italic>ZafA</italic> and <italic>GliZ</italic> were upregulated during phagocytosis.
