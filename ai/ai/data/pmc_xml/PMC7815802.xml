Here we investigated mechanisms by which environmentally important <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> bacteria with plant-beneficial activity perform kin interference competition. We show that killing between phylogenetically closely-related strains involves contractile phage tail-like devices called R-tailocins that puncture target cell membranes. Using live-cell imaging, we evidence that R-tailocins are produced at the cell center, transported to the cell poles and ejected by explosive cell lysis. This enables their dispersal over several tens of micrometers to reach targeted cells. We visualize R-tailocin-mediated competition dynamics between closely-related <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains at the single-cell level, both in non-induced condition and upon artificial induction.

These bacteria have evolved mechanisms to cope with different stresses inherent to living in these environments. <italic>Inter alia</italic>, they need to outcompete other contenders to durably establish their presence in the colonized environment. Strains belonging to the <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> (Pp) or <italic>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</italic> (Pc) subgroups within the <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> species complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> typically are highly competitive root colonizers that, however, are also able to establish themselves in contrasting ecological niches, notably in insects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These bacteria are widely studied for their potential use as agricultural inoculants for plant growth promotion, defense priming and protection against pathogens and pest insects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A part of their competitiveness is due to the production of an array of secondary metabolites with broad antimicrobial activities against bacteria, fungal and protist competitors that would fight for common resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">As well as competing against distantly-related organisms, pseudomonads are in competition with kin bacteria, i.e., phylogenetically close relatives, which we consider as strains belonging to the same subgroup in this study. Therefore, they also produce narrow-spectrum toxins, called bacteriocins that typically target close relatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These compounds vary greatly in structure and in activity profiles owing to their specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. There is some evidence that bacteriocins might shape natural communities of environmental <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> but the extent of their impact has yet to be defined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Bacteriophages and phage-like particles also exhibit specific activity spectra and have emerged as potent specific weapons against competitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Indeed, bacteriophages were shown to influence microbiomes through their lysogenic and lytic cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. For instance, phages may impact species diversity by multiple mechanisms such as reducing the number of highly competitive bacteria (&#x0201c;killing the winner&#x0201d;), releasing nutrients and DNA into the environment and immunizing bacteria against similar viral relatives or equip them with new traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">When bacteriophages integrate their genome into bacteria, it may give rise to complex structures such as phage tail-like particles that can be used against other competitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. One of these structures was first discovered in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and was termed pyocin by analogy with colicins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Similar structures were found in other bacterial species and broadly designated as tailocins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> or phage tail-like bacteriocins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. There are two main types of tailocins, R-type and F-type, typified by the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> R-pyocins and F-pyocins, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. F-tailocins are flexible and non-contractile rod-like structures, whereas R-tailocins are large, rigid and contractile tail-like structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Although F-type and R-type tailocins are thought to be evolutionarily related to phages from the families <italic>Siphoviridae</italic> and <italic>Myoviridae</italic>, respectively, these structures are not considered degenerated phages but evolved powerful bacterial weapons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. R-tailocins are structurally related to a large family of bacterial contractile injection systems, which comprises the type VI secretion system (T6SS) and phage tail-like insecticidal particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The genomic loci encoding R-tailocins in pseudomonads specify structural components as well as the regulators and lysis cassette permitting a timely production and release of the particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Conversely, R-tailocin clusters no longer comprise the genes coding for the capsid that encapsulates the phage genomic material and makes a normal phage self-replicative. Analogous to the contractile tail of certain bacteriophages, R-tailocins are composed out of a sheath and a hollow tube forming a long helicoidal hexameric structure that is attached to a baseplate exhibiting multiple tail fibers that appear to direct specificity and permit adsorption to the cell surface of the targeted cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The contractile tail is thought to cause a dissipation of the membrane potential, leading to the death of the targeted cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The conditions triggering tailocin production naturally are basically unknown. In the laboratory, tailocin assembly can be induced by DNA damage stress provoking the SOS response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Tailocin release then appears to be mediated by components of the lysis cassette (holins, lysins and spanin complexes) that degrade the cell wall of the triggered bacterium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Environmental <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> were recently shown to harbor gene clusters encoding R-tailocins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, there is still very limited knowledge about the activity profiles, the involvement in competition or the production dynamic of these complex phage tail-like particles in environmental pseudomonads. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the diversity of R-tailocins and other phage particles belonging to strains of the Pp and Pc subgroups and related it to their activity spectra within these phylogenetically very closely-related environmental pseudomonads. Then we focused on the type strain of the Pp subgroup, namely CHA0, that is a well-studied model organism for environmental <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. For the first time to our knowledge, we visualized the production dynamic of R-tailocins in a bacterial cell and their ejection upon explosive cell lysis. By live cell imaging, we documented competitions involving R-tailocins between two closely-related strains at single-cell level, both in non-induced condition and upon artificial induction, evidencing that this phage tail-related weaponry can play a decisive role in the micro-environment of kin competitors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Environmental pseudomonads have a large diversity in viral particles that exhibit phylogenetic-specific activities</title><p id="Par9">To better understand the role of viral particles as weapons in competition between kin bacteria, we selected phylogenetically closely-related environmental <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> of the Pp and Pc subgroups that encompass the bacterial model <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> type strain CHA0 (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We first looked at the distribution of viral particle encoding loci in the genomes of this set of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains using the prediction tool PHASTER (PHAge Search Tool Enhanced Release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>), manually verifying each region to classify them as either incomplete or complete prophages.

Two viral families were identified: <italic>Siphoviridae</italic> and <italic>Myoviridae</italic>. PHASTER also classified as intact prophages another set of gene clusters that are incomplete, as they no longer contain the genes encoding the synthesis of the viral capsid. These regions correspond to gene clusters encoding phage tail-related structures designated as R-tailocins and are present in all <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genomes used in this study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Soft agar cultures of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains (columns) were challenged with viral particles extracted from cultures of these same strains (rows).

We found that strains were overall more sensitive to the viral particles extracted from phylogenetically closely-related relatives (i.e., from the same subgroup, Pp or Pc) and even to the viral particles extracted from the same species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Additionally, some <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains, specifically AU13582, AU11706 and AU20219, had no targets within the tested Pp and Pc collection (even though they harbor viral particle loci in their genomes) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This absence of effect may also be due to the non-production of viral particles following induction.

Two of these regions encode complete phages belonging to the <italic>Myoviridae</italic> and <italic>Siphoviridae</italic> families, respectively. Conversely, the third region lacks the genes specifying capsid formation and was identified as the gene cluster encoding the production of two distinct phage tail-like particles that we termed tailocin #1 and tailocin #2 of CHA0 (see below). To determine the specific activity spectrum of each viral particle of CHA0, we deconstructed them by deletion of their coding regions (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>) and tested the individual and combined effects of the extracted viral particles on the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains of this study. A total of six strains were impacted by at least one of the viral particles of CHA0 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

Each CHA0 R-tailocin is predicted to have its own tail tape measure protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) that by analogy with related proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> is thought to scaffold the respective tail tubes during their assembly. Interestingly, the coding sequence of the tail tape measure protein for tailocin #1 is markedly longer than the one for tailocin #2, which explains the different lengths of the two particles (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The R-tailocin cluster of CHA0 is also equipped with a set of genes encoding a holin, two endolysins and a spanin complex (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>), i.e. all components known to be required for the lysis of the bacterial cell wall and the release of the phage-like particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The organization of the genes specifying these structural components is different for the two R-tailocins indicating that they have most probably evolved from two independent prophage infections.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Architecture of the R-tailocin gene cluster of <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> CHA0 and diversity of tailocin clusters among strains of the <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> (Pp) subgroup and <italic>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</italic> (Pc) subgroup.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The R-tailocin gene cluster of <italic>P. protegens</italic> CHA0 is composed out of 36 phage-related genes that encode two distinct R-tailocin complexes (tailocin #1, tailocin #2).

One of the R-tailocin loci is conserved amongst all the genomes selected and is conserved with tailocin #2 of CHA0 (green-colored gene clusters), while the other two R-tailocin loci are separated between the Pp, which corresponds to tailocin #1 of CHA0 (purple-colored gene clusters), and Pc subgroups (orange-colored gene clusters) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The F-tailocin locus is only present in the genome of some strains belonging to the Pp subgroup (blue-colored gene clusters, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

We hypothesize that this is a recent acquisition that may be later domesticated to form a tailocin-type weapon. Although the clusters of the four different types of tailocins are conserved amongst the various genomes, there are differences, notably in the genes encoding the tail fibers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

Additionally, there is only a limited similarity amongst the genes located at the extremities of the clusters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

The transition between spherical shape and complete lysis occurred rapidly.

Hence, we wanted to determine if R-tailocins have an effect on the competitiveness of cells during competition towards their kin, both in non-induced condition and upon artificial induction of tailocin production by MMC. Therefore, we selected a strain sensitive to tailocin #1 of CHA0, namely Pf-5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and first confirmed its sensitivity to this viral particle in liquid cultures through the addition of purified tailocin #1 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). Second, we observed Pf-5 in direct competition with CHA0 expressing fluorescently labeled R-tailocins (tailocin #1 with mScarlet-I, tailocin #2 with sfGFP) using time-lapse microscopy. As the production of R-tailocins is a rare event without induction (less than 1%, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>, Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">2</xref>), since their production is a fatal decision for the individual cell, we induced their production in CHA0 with MMC prior to placing the so-primed strain into cell-to-cell competition with Pf-5. CHA0 cells were thoroughly washed 30&#x02009;min following induction as not to induce Pf-5 cells by the chemical. As observed previously, following the induction of CHA0, fluorescent R-tailocins were produced at the center of the cell and migrated to the cell poles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Movies&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Following the production of the R-tailocins, CHA0 cells lysed and thrusted the viral particles in the environment where they attacked cells of the competitor Pf-5. The production of R-tailocins and the lysis of different CHA0 cells resulted in the lysis of several Pf-5 cells in their vicinity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Movies&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>), providing live cellular support for the idea that these phage tail-like devices are efficient weapons for killing kin competitors. However, we expected that the production of R-tailocins would have a more drastic impact on the competitor as Pf-5 is notably sensitive to preparations of purified tailocin #1. We hypothesized that the presence of the fluorescent tag may have an influence on the conformation of tailocin #1, thus impacting its activity. Indeed, examination of purified mScarlet-I tagged tailocin #1 by TEM revealed that the tagged sheath is more compact and therefore it likely has more difficulty efficiently contracting compared to the native form (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2a</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">b</xref>, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

Here, we demonstrated that following explosive lysis of cells and viral particle ejection, tailocin #1 is a targeted and efficient microscale weapon against the kin competitor, both in non-induced condition and upon artificial induction by MMC. Indeed, through different time-lapse experiments, we monitored the competition between Pf-5 and various non-induced variants of CHA0 and evidenced the specific role of tailocin #1 of CHA0 against Pf-5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, Supplementary Movie&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>). We showed that following the release of tailocin #1 from CHA0, closely located Pf-5 cells are killed. We confirmed this hypothesis by artificially inducing the production of these viral particles with MMC and observed a greater impact on this sensitive strain (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4b</xref>, Supplementary Movie&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Presently, it is difficult to speculate on possible factors inducing R-tailocin release even in non-artificially induced CHA0 cells during competition with kin competitor Pf-5, but it seems likely that a mechanism of interference competition sensing is involved, such as sensing of DNA damage, membrane perturbation or nutrient shortage caused by the competitor attacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, albeit R-tailocins play a major role in competition at cellular level, their impact is less readily visible following prolonged competition in classical confrontation assays in liquid or on solid media (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). We suggest that R-tailocins are more likely an altruistic rather than a spiteful weapon, reducing the invasion from a kin at a microscale level. However, in the micro-environment of a cell deploying its R-tailocin weaponry the consequences for sensitive kin cells are fatal. This may be particularly relevant in a biofilm or microcolony environment where R-tailocins may serve as specialized and targeted weapons to hold off competitors from invading discrete colonization sites. In contrary to time-lapse microscopy analyses as done here, classical confrontation assays combined with CFU counting seem therefore inapt to fully image the subtle localized effects of the phage-like weaponry of these environmental bacteria.</p><p id="Par28">Although we were able to study in depth the effect of tailocin #1 of CHA0 on Pf-5, we also identified three other viral particle sequences in the genome of CHA0. Interestingly, we found that two out of the four viral particles have very specialized activity spectra affecting either strains from the <italic>P. protegens sensu stricto</italic> species (siphovirus) or strains belonging to the <italic>P. protegens</italic> subgroup (tailocin #1) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). However, we did not find any targets for the two remaining viral particles. Since tailocin #2 was visualized with TEM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and found in all genomes of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> in this study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), we hypothesize that this R-tailocin has a different activity spectrum affecting strains that do not belong to the ones tested. R-tailocins targeting phylogenetically distant species that may occupy the same ecological niche have been reported for other environmental bacteria, including <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, <italic>P. fluorescens</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and <italic>Xenorhabdus nematophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Tailocin #2 of CHA0 should be tested on more distantly-related strains to find targets. Conversely, the myovirus was not detected following viral particle extraction, which explains the inefficiency of extracts towards the selected <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. We suggest that the myovirus is a cryptic phage, which is a prophage that is no longer able to induce the lysis of its bacterial host and produce phage particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. This is most likely due to genome rearrangements and degeneration of genetic content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. We further supported our hypothesis of specialization of viral particles by demonstrating that all viral particles extracted from one strain have more of a lytic effect on other strains belonging to the same subgroup (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As previously mentioned, this may be a mechanism to prevent kin bacteria from invading an already established population, as it was described for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms, in which strains that harbor viral particles had a competitive advantage over those who lacked viral particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">Accordingly, the presence of viral particles, more specifically R-tailocins, is not uncommon in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genomes. In the 25 genomes tested in this study, we found a tailocin hotspot region, between <italic>mutS</italic> and <italic>cinA/recA</italic>, which was previously identified as a R-tailocin gene cluster insertion site in some other environmental pseudomonads, including strains of the <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Within this hotspot, we found that there was at least one R-tailocin, namely tailocin #2 of CHA0 that was conserved among all the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Interestingly, this particular R-tailocin was also identified in genomes of more distantly-related <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, such as <italic>Pseudomonas corrugata</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas korensis</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, suggesting that the original prophage giving rise to this specific R-tailocin may have been acquired by a common ancestor of all these <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. However, genetic differences occurred, specifically for the genes encoding the tail fibers, involved in the cell target recognition. Furthermore, it appears that the other tailocins identified in the selected genomes are specific to each subgroup (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). One of the most simple evolutionary scenarios could be that multiple temperate phages were independently acquired, leading to different tailocins through evolution. This hypothesis could be supported by the undomesticated prophage present in the genome of <italic>P. chlororaphis</italic> subsp. <italic>aureofaciens</italic> strain O6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> that may evolve into a tailocin. Furthermore, as these tailocins may be acquired independently, they have a narrow and specific activity spectrum that may have been obtained through the specificity of the prophage but may also have evolved following acquisition. When compiling all this genomic information, we suggest that prophage domestication by bacteria could be a multi-step evolutionary process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> in conjunction with horizontal gene transfers and recombination between different prophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Following these steps, the resulting tailocins may be specialized through the genetic modifications of key genes involved in specificity such as the tail fibers, to become precise weapons.</p><p id="Par30">Based on the results of present study, we propose a model where certain R-tailocins are targeted and efficient weapons in microscale competitions between kin bacteria (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We suggest that R-tailocins are induced either spontaneously or by external stressors, including interference competition signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> or competitor toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Following induction, R-tailocins are synthesized at the center of the cell and migrate to the cell poles. Once R-tailocins have migrated, producing cells are lysed in a two-step process, firstly by forming spheroblasts and secondly through complete lysis of the cells. Following explosive lysis, the viral particles are thrusted into the environment where they reach competing bacteria. R-tailocins specifically bind and kill kin bacteria that are ecological niche competitors while exempting more distantly-related strains. This kin-exclusion may allow the reduction of kin bacteria and may favor the input of more phylogenetically distant bacteria that bring new genes involved in different metabolic pathways that would increase the diversity of public goods within the community. Furthermore, clonal cells are not disturbed by the R-tailocins in the environment as bacteria seem to be immune to their own R-tailocins.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>Model of the ecological role of R-tailocins in interbacterial competitiveness.</title><p>We propose a model where R-tailocins play an important ecological role within a bacterial community such as the ones that compose biofilms. <bold>1</bold> Some cells are induced upon environmental stress and synthesize R-tailocins that are produced at the center of the cell and migrate to the cell poles. <bold>2</bold> Subsequently to the migration of the R-tailocins, the cells lyses, firstly by forming a spheroblast. <bold>3</bold> Secondly, the cell lyses completely and explosively, thereby thrusting its R-tailocins in the environment. <bold>4</bold> Once in the medium, R-tailocins specifically bind to kin bacteria and kill them whereas more distantly-related bacteria are spared. <bold>5</bold> Clonal cells are immune and are therefore protected from the R-tailocins released in the environment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="42003_2020_1581_Fig8_HTML" id="d32e1554"/></fig></p><p id="Par31">To conclude, tailocins and viral particles are likely to participate in the localized &#x0201c;cell-to-cell&#x0201d; competition of bacteria.

When CHA0 cultures reached exponential growth phase (OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 0.4&#x02013;0.6), 3&#x02009;&#x000b5;g&#x02009;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of MMC was added and the cultures were incubated for 30&#x02009;min at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. CHA0 cultures were washed twice with sterile 0.9 % NaCl solution to remove all MMC and then put in competition with Pf-5. For experiments without MMC induction, CHA0 and Pf-5 were placed in 1:1 ratio competitions once the cultures reached exponential growth phase. Six microliters of the competition mixes were deposited onto 1 % agarose patches supplemented with 1 X minimal medium salts, 4&#x02009;mM sucrose and 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M FeCl<sub>3</sub>. Agarose patches were placed upside down into a sealed microscopy chamber (Perfusion Chamber, H. Saur Laborbedarf, Germany) containing a maximum of four patches per chamber. A maximum of five positions per patch were recorded. Cells were followed during 8&#x02009;h and images were captured every 5&#x02009;min. Cartoons were drawn manually in Adobe Illustrator (v.2020) using the original time lapse figures as templates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p id="Par49">All experiments were performed at least using three biological replicates as detailed in the figure legends.
