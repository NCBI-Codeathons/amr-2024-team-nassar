Mechanism of Fumonisin Self-Resistance: Fusarium verticillioides Contains Four Fumonisin B1-Insensitive-Ceramide Synthases.,38922130,"Fusarium verticillioides produces fumonisins, which are mycotoxins inhibiting sphingolipid biosynthesis in humans, animals, and other eukaryotes. Fumonisins are presumed virulence factors of plant pathogens, but may also play a role in interactions between competing fungi. We observed higher resistance to added fumonisin B1 (FB1) in fumonisin-producing Fusarium verticillioides than in nonproducing F. graminearum, and likewise between isolates of Aspergillus and Alternaria differing in production of sphinganine-analog toxins. It has been reported that in F. verticillioides, ceramide synthase encoded in the fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster is responsible for self-resistance. We reinvestigated the role of FUM17 and FUM18 by generating a double mutant strain in a fum1 background. Nearly unchanged resistance to added FB1 was observed compared to the parental fum1 strain. A recently developed fumonisin-sensitive baker's yeast strain allowed for the testing of candidate ceramide synthases by heterologous expression. The overexpression of the yeast LAC1 gene, but not LAG1, increased fumonisin resistance. High-level resistance was conferred by FUM18, but not by FUM17. Likewise, strong resistance to FB1 was caused by overexpression of the presumed F. verticillioides ""housekeeping"" ceramide synthases CER1, CER2, and CER3, located outside the fumonisin cluster, indicating that F. verticillioides possesses a redundant set of insensitive targets as a self-resistance mechanism."
Metagenomic Insights into Potential Impacts of Antibacterial Biosynthesis and Anthropogenic Activity on Nationwide Soil Resistome.,38795484,"The presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soils has received extensive attention regarding its impacts on environmental, animal, and human systems under One Health. However, the health risks of soil ARGs and microbial determinants of soil resistomes remain poorly understood. Here, a nationwide metagenomic investigation of ARGs in cropland and forest soils in China was conducted. The findings indicated that the abundance and richness of high-risk (i.e., mobilizable, pathogen-carriable and clinically relevant) ARGs in cropland soils were 25.7 times and 8.4 times higher, respectively, compared to those identified in forest soils, suggesting the contribution of agricultural practices to the elevated risk level of soil resistomes. The biosynthetic potential of antibacterials best explained the total ARG abundance (Mantel's r = 0.52, p < 0.001) when compared with environmental variables and anthropogenic disturbance. Both microbial producers' self-resistance and antagonistic interactions contributed to the ARG abundance, of which self-resistance ARGs account for 14.1 %- 35.1 % in abundance. With the increased biosynthetic potential of antibacterials, the antagonistic interactions within the microbial community were greatly enhanced, leading to a significant increase in ARG abundance. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of the emergence and dissemination of soil ARGs and provide critical implications for the risk control of soil resistomes."
Combinatorial metabolic engineering of Streptomyces sp. CB03234-S for the enhanced production of anthraquinone-fused enediyne tiancimycins.,38704580,"Anthraquinone-fused enediynes (AFEs) are excellent payloads for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The yields of AFEs in the original bacterial hosts are extremely low. Multiple traditional methods had been adopted to enhance the production of the AFEs. Despite these efforts, the production titers of these compounds are still low, presenting a practical challenge for their development. Tiancimycins (TNMs) are a class of AFEs produced by Streptomyces sp. CB03234. One of their salient features is that they exhibit rapid and complete cell killing ability against various cancer cell lines."
Deciphering the Biosynthesis and Physiological Function of 5-Methylated Pyrazinones Produced by Myxobacteria.,38559311,"Myxobacteria are a prolific source of secondary metabolites with sheer chemical complexity, intriguing biosynthetic enzymology, and diverse biological activities. In this study, we report the discovery, biosynthesis, biomimetic total synthesis, physiological function, structure-activity relationship, and self-resistance mechanism of the 5-methylated pyrazinone coralinone from a myxobacterium Corallococcus exiguus SDU70. A single NRPS/PKS gene corA was genetically and biochemically demonstrated to orchestrate coralinone, wherein the integral PKS part is responsible for installing the 5-methyl group. Intriguingly, coralinone exacerbated cellular aggregation of myxobacteria grown in liquid cultures by enhancing the secretion of extracellular matrix, and the 5-methylation is indispensable for the alleged activity. We provided an evolutionary landscape of the corA-associated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) distributed in the myxobacterial realm, revealing the divergent evolution for the diversity-oriented biosynthesis of 5-alkyated pyrazinones. This phylogenetic contextualization provoked us to identify corB located in the proximity of corA as a self-resistance gene. CorB was experimentally verified to be a protease that hydrolyzes extracellular proteins to antagonize the agglutination-inducing effect of coralinone. Overall, we anticipate these findings will provide new insights into the chemical ecology of myxobacteria and lay foundations for the maximal excavation of these largely underexplored resources."
Five New Analogs of Streptogramin Antibiotic Viridogrisein Isolated from Streptomyces niveoruber.,38233135,"Five new viridogriseins B-F were isolated from Streptomyces niveoruber, along with viridogrisein and griseoviridin which belong to streptogramin family antibiotics. A combination of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis and the advanced Marfey's method elucidated the structures of viridogriseins B-F, each featuring distinct constituent amino acids. Consistent with other streptogramin family antibiotics, these viridogrisein analogs exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, equimolar mixtures of each viridogrisein analog and griseoviridin inhibited the growth of S. aureus more potently than each analog treatment alone. Finally, an in vitro functional analysis of SgvY, encoded in the viridogrisein biosynthetic gene cluster, revealed that SgvY detoxifies viridogrisein against S. aureus by linearization. Considering that viridogrisein is not autotoxic to S. niveoruber, SgvY likely contributes to the self-resistance system against viridogrisein in S. niveoruber."
Uncommon Arrangement of Self-resistance Allows Biosynthesis of de novo Purine Biosynthesis Inhibitor that Acts as an Immunosuppressor.,38051581,"(-)-FR901483 (1) isolated from the fungus Cladobotryum sp. No.11231 achieves immunosuppression via nucleic acid biosynthesis inhibition rather than IL-2 production inhibition as accomplished by FK506 and cyclosporin A. Recently, we identified the frz gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 1. It contains frzK, a gene homologous to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT)that catalyzes the initial step of de novo purine biosynthesis. We speculated that frzK encodes a PPAT that escapes inhibition by 1 and functions as a self-resistance enzyme (SRE) for the producing host. Nevertheless, details remained elusive. Here, we report the biochemical and structural analyses of FrzK and its Escherichia coli counterpart, PurF. Recombinantly produced FrzK exhibited PPAT activity, albeit weaker than PurF, but evaded strong inhibition by 1. These results confirmed that the target of 1 is PPAT, and FrzK acts as an SRE by maintaining the de novo purine biosynthetic capability in the presence of 1. To understand how FrzK evades inhibition by 1, we determined the crystal structure of PurF in the complex with 1 and constructed a homology model of FrzK. Sequence and structural analyses of various PPATs identified that many residues unique to FrzK occur near the Flexible Loop that remains disordered when inactive but becomes ordered and covers up the active site upon activation by substrate binding. Kinetic characterizations of mutants of the unique residues revealed that the resistance of FrzK against 1 may be conferred by structurally predisposing the Flexible Loop to the active, closed conformation even in the presence of 1."
"Automated, self-resistance gene-guided, and high-throughput genome mining of bioactive natural products from Streptomyces.",37961497,"Natural products (NPs) produced by bacteria, fungi and plants are a major source of drug leads. Streptomyces species are particularly important in this regard as they produce numerous natural products with prominent bioactivities. Here we report a fully a utomated, s calable and high-throughput platform for discovery of bioactive n atural p roducts in S treptomyces (FAST-NPS). This platform comprises computational prediction and prioritization of target biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) guided by self-resistance genes, highly efficient and automated direct cloning and heterologous expression of BGCs, followed by high-throughput fermentation and product extraction from Streptomyces strains. As a proof of concept, we applied this platform to clone 105 BGCs ranging from 10 to 100 kb that contain potential self-resistance genes from 11 Streptomyces strains with a success rate of 95%. Heterologous expression of all successfully cloned BGCs in Streptomyces lividans TK24 led to the discovery of 23 natural products from 12 BGCs. We selected 5 of these 12 BGCs for further characterization and found each of them could produce at least one natural product with antibacterial and/or anti-tumor activity, which resulted in a total of 8 bioactive natural products. Overall, this work would greatly accelerate the discovery of bioactive natural products for biomedical and biotechnological applications."
Targeted genome mining for microbial antitumor agents acting through DNA intercalation.,37575356,"Microbial natural products have been one of the most important sources for drug development. In the current postgenomic era, sequence-driven approaches for natural product discovery are becoming increasingly popular. Here, we develop an effective genome mining strategy for the targeted discovery of microbial metabolites with antitumor activities. Our method employs uvrA-like genes as genetic markers, which have been identified in the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of several chemotherapeutic drugs of microbial origin and confer self-resistance to the corresponding producers. Through systematic genomic analysis of gifted actinobacteria genera, identification of uvrA-like gene-containing BGCs, and targeted isolation of products from a BGC prioritized for metabolic analysis, we identified a new tetracycline-type DNA intercalator timmycins. Our results thus provide a new genome mining strategy for the efficient discovery of antitumor agents acting through DNA intercalation."
A Comprehensive Self-Resistance Gene Database for Natural-Product Discovery with an Application to Marine Bacterial Genome Mining.,37569821,"In the world of microorganisms, the biosynthesis of natural products in secondary metabolism and the self-resistance of the host always occur together and complement each other. Identifying resistance genes from biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) helps us understand the self-defense mechanism and predict the biological activity of natural products synthesized by microorganisms. However, a comprehensive database of resistance genes is still lacking, which hinders natural product annotation studies in large-scale genome mining. In this study, we compiled a resistance gene database (RGDB) by scanning the four available databases: CARD, MIBiG, NCBIAMR, and UniProt. Every resistance gene in the database was annotated with resistance mechanisms and possibly involved chemical compounds, using manual annotation and transformation from the resource databases. The RGDB was applied to analyze resistance genes in 7432 BGCs in 1390 genomes from a marine microbiome project. Our calculation showed that the RGDB successfully identified resistance genes for more than half of the BGCs, suggesting that the database helps prioritize BGCs that produce biologically active natural products."
Complete Genome Analysis of Subtercola sp. PAMC28395: Genomic Insights into Its Potential Role for Cold Adaptation and Biotechnological Applications.,37374983,"This study reports the complete genome sequence of Subtercola sp. PAMC28395, a strain isolated from cryoconite in Uganda. This strain possesses several active carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes involved in glycogen and trehalose metabolism. Additionally, two specific genes associated with α-galactosidase (GH36) and bacterial alpha-1,2-mannosidase (GH92) were identified in this strain. The presence of these genes indicates the likelihood that they can be expressed, enabling the strain to break down specific polysaccharides derived from plants or the shells of nearby crabs. The authors performed a comparative analysis of CAZyme patterns and biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in several Subtercola strains and provided annotations describing the unique characteristics of these strains. The comparative analysis of BGCs revealed that four strains, including PAMC28395, have oligosaccharide BGCs, and we confirmed that the pentose phosphate pathway was configured perfectly in the genome of PAMC28395, which may be associated with adaptation to low temperatures. Additionally, all strains contained antibiotic resistance genes, indicating a complex self-resistance system. These results suggest that PAMC28395 can adapt quickly to the cold environment and produce energy autonomously. This study provides valuable information on novel functional enzymes, particularly CAZymes, that operate at low temperatures and can be used for biotechnological applications and fundamental research purposes."
Structural and functional analyses of the echinomycin resistance conferring protein Ecm16 from Streptomyces lasalocidi.,37198233,"Echinomycin is a natural product DNA bisintercalator antibiotic. The echinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces lasalocidi includes a gene encoding the self-resistance protein Ecm16. Here, we present the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of Ecm16 bound to adenosine diphosphate. The structure of Ecm16 closely resembles that of UvrA, the DNA damage sensor component of the prokaryotic nucleotide excision repair system, but Ecm16 lacks the UvrB-binding domain and its associated zinc-binding module found in UvrA. Mutagenesis study revealed that the insertion domain of Ecm16 is required for DNA binding. Furthermore, the specific amino acid sequence of the insertion domain allows Ecm16 to distinguish echinomycin-bound DNA from normal DNA and link substrate binding to ATP hydrolysis activity. Expression of ecm16 in the heterologous host Brevibacillus choshinensis conferred resistance against echinomycin and other quinomycin antibiotics, including thiocoraline, quinaldopeptin, and sandramycin. Our study provides new insight into how the producers of DNA bisintercalator antibiotics fend off the toxic compounds that they produce."
LexR Positively Regulates the LexABC Efflux Pump Involved in Self-Resistance to the Antimicrobial Di-N-Oxide Phenazine in Lysobacter antibioticus.,37166326,"Myxin, a di-N-oxide phenazine isolated from the soil bacterium Lysobacter antibioticus, exhibits potent activity against various microorganisms and has the potential to be developed as an agrochemical. Antibiotic-producing microorganisms have developed self-resistance mechanisms to protect themselves from autotoxicity. Antibiotic efflux is vital for such protection. Recently, we identified a resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump, LexABC, involved in self-resistance against myxin in L. antibioticus. Expression of its genes, lexABC, was induced by myxin and was positively regulated by the LysR family transcriptional regulator LexR. The molecular mechanisms, however, have not been clear. Here, LexR was found to bind to the lexABC promoter region to directly regulate expression. Moreover, myxin enhanced this binding. Molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that myxin bound LexR with valine and lysine residues at positions 146 (V146) and 195 (K195), respectively. Furthermore, mutation of K195 in vivo led to downregulation of the gene lexA. These results indicated that LexR sensed and bound with myxin, thereby directly activating the expression of the LexABC efflux pump and increasing L. antibioticus resistance against myxin. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic-producing bacteria exhibit various sophisticated mechanisms for self-protection against their own secondary metabolites. RND efflux pumps that eliminate antibiotics from cells are ubiquitous in Gram-negative bacteria. Myxin is a heterocyclic N-oxide phenazine with potent antimicrobial and antitumor activities produced by the soil bacterium L. antibioticus. The RND pump LexABC contributes to the self-resistance of L. antibioticus against myxin. Herein, we report a mechanism involving the LysR family regulator LexR that binds to myxin and directly activates the LexABC pump. Further study on self-resistance mechanisms could help the investigation of strategies to deal with increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance and enable the discovery of novel natural products with resistance genes as selective markers."
Comparative and Functional Analyses Reveal Conserved and Variable Regulatory Systems That Control Lasalocid Biosynthesis in Different Streptomyces Species.,36847561,"Lasalocid, a representative polyether ionophore, has been successfully applied in veterinary medicine and animal husbandry and also displays promising potential for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the regulatory system governing lasalocid biosynthesis remains obscure. Here, we identified two conserved (lodR2 and lodR3) and one variable (lodR1, found only in Streptomyces sp. strain FXJ1.172) putative regulatory genes through a comparison of the lasalocid biosynthetic gene cluster (lod) from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 with those (las and lsd) from Streptomyces lasalocidi. Gene disruption experiments demonstrated that both lodR1 and lodR3 positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, while lodR2 plays a negative regulatory role. To unravel the regulatory mechanism, transcriptional analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) along with footprinting experiments were performed. The results revealed that LodR1 and LodR2 could bind to the intergenic regions of lodR1-lodAB and lodR2-lodED, respectively, thereby repressing the transcription of the lodAB and lodED operons, respectively. The repression of lodAB-lodC by LodR1 likely boosts lasalocid biosynthesis. Furthermore, LodR2 and LodE constitute a repressor-activator system that senses changes in intracellular lasalocid concentrations and coordinates its biosynthesis. LodR3 could directly activate the transcription of key structural genes. Comparative and parallel functional analyses of the homologous genes in S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T confirmed the conserved roles of lodR2, lodE, and lodR3 in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis. Intriguingly, the variable gene locus lodR1-lodC from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 seems functionally conserved when introduced into S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T. Overall, our findings demonstrate that lasalocid biosynthesis is tightly controlled by both conserved and variable regulators, providing valuable guidance for further improving lasalocid production. IMPORTANCE Compared to its elaborated biosynthetic pathway, the regulation of lasalocid biosynthesis remains obscure. Here, we characterize the roles of regulatory genes in lasalocid biosynthetic gene clusters of two distinct Streptomyces species and identify a conserved repressor-activator system, LodR2-LodE, which could sense changes in the concentration of lasalocid and coordinate its biosynthesis with self-resistance. Furthermore, in parallel, we verify that the regulatory system identified in a new Streptomyces isolate is valid in the industrial lasalocid producer and thus applicable for the construction of high-yield strains. These findings deepen our understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in the production of polyether ionophores and provide novel clues for the rational design of industrial strains for scaled-up production."
Discovery of a Unique Flavonoid Biosynthesis Mechanism in Fungi by Genome Mining.,36704842,"Flavonoids are important plant natural products with variable structures and bioactivities. All known plant flavonoids are generated under the catalysis of a type III polyketide synthase (PKS) followed by a chalcone isomerase (CHI) and a flavone synthase (FNS). In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of chlorflavonin, a fungal flavonoid with acetolactate synthase inhibitory activity, was discovered using a self-resistance-gene-directed strategy. A novel flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in fungi was revealed. A core nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) is responsible for the generation of the key precursor chalcone. Then, a new type of CHI catalyzes the conversion of a chalcone into a flavanone by a histidine-mediated oxa-Michael addition mechanism. Finally, the desaturation of flavanone to flavone is catalyzed by a new type of FNS, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent oxidoreductase."
Newly Discovered Mechanisms of Antibiotic Self-Resistance with Multiple Enzymes Acting at Different Locations and Stages.,36671236,"Self-resistance determinants are essential for the biosynthesis of bioactive natural products and are closely related to drug resistance in clinical settings. The study of self-resistance mechanisms has long moved forward on the discovery of new resistance genes and the characterization of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by these proteins. However, as more examples of self-resistance have been reported, it has been revealed that the enzymatic reactions contribute to self-protection are not confined to the cellular location where the final toxic compounds are present. In this review, we summarize representative examples of self-resistance mechanisms for bioactive natural products functional at different cell locations to explore the models of resistance strategies involved. Moreover, we also highlight those resistance determinants that are widespread in nature and describe the applications of self-resistance genes in natural product mining to interrogate the landscape of self-resistance genes in drug resistance-related new drug discovery."
Heterologous Expression Reveals Ancient Properties of Tei3—A VanS Ortholog from the Teicoplanin Producer Actinoplanes teichomyceticus.,36555354,"Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are among the most clinically successful antimicrobials. GPAs inhibit cell-wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria via binding to lipid II. Natural GPAs are produced by various actinobacteria. Being themselves Gram-positives, the GPA producers evolved sophisticated mechanisms of self-resistance to avoid suicide during antibiotic production. These self-resistance genes are considered the primary source of GPA resistance genes actually spreading among pathogenic enterococci and staphylococci. The GPA-resistance mechanism in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus—the producer of the last-resort-drug teicoplanin—has been intensively studied in recent years, posing relevant questions about the role of Tei3 sensor histidine kinase. In the current work, the molecular properties of Tei3 were investigated. The setup of a GPA-responsive assay system in the model Streptomyces coelicolor allowed us to demonstrate that Tei3 functions as a non-inducible kinase, conferring high levels of GPA resistance in A. teichomyceticus. The expression of different truncated versions of tei3 in S. coelicolor indicated that both the transmembrane helices of Tei3 are crucial for proper functioning. Finally, a hybrid gene was constructed, coding for a chimera protein combining the Tei3 sensor domain with the kinase domain of VanS, with the latter being the inducible Tei3 ortholog from S. coelicolor. Surprisingly, such a chimera did not respond to teicoplanin, but indeed to the related GPA A40926. Coupling these experimental results with a further in silico analysis, a novel scenario on GPA-resistance and biosynthetic genes co-evolution in A. teichomyceticus was hereby proposed."
Discovery of Efrotomycin Congeners and Heterologous Expression-Based Insights into the Self-Resistance Mechanism.,36445346,"Four new efrotomycins, A1-A4 (1-4), were isolated from the salt mine-derived Amycolatopsis cihanbeyliensis DSM 45679 and structurally determined. Efrotomycins A3 (3) and A4 (4) feature a tetrahydrofuran ring configured distinctly from known elfamycins. Heterologous expression of the efrotomycin gene cluster (efr BGC) in Streptomyces lividans SBT18 led to efrotomycin B1 (5), the yield of which was improved several fold upon introduction of the transporter gene efrT, a putative self-resistance determinant outside of the efr BGC."
Abundant antibiotic resistance genes in rhizobiome of the human edible Moringa oleifera medicinal plant.,36187977,"Moringa oleifera (or the miracle tree) is a wild plant species widely grown for its seed pods and leaves, and is used in traditional herbal medicine. The metagenomic whole genome shotgun sequencing (mWGS) approach was used to characterize antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of the rhizobiomes of this wild plant and surrounding bulk soil microbiomes and to figure out the chance and consequences for highly abundant ARGs, e.g., mtrA, golS, soxR, oleC, novA, kdpE, vanRO, parY, and rbpA, to horizontally transfer to human gut pathogens via mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The results indicated that abundance of these ARGs, except for golS, was higher in rhizosphere of M. oleifera than that in bulk soil microbiome with no signs of emerging new soil ARGs in either soil type. The most highly abundant metabolic processes of the most abundant ARGs were previously detected in members of phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. These processes refer to three resistance mechanisms namely antibiotic efflux pump, antibiotic target alteration and antibiotic target protection. Antibiotic efflux mechanism included resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND), ATP-binding cassette (ABC), and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) antibiotics pumps as well as the two-component regulatory kdpDE system. Antibiotic target alteration included glycopeptide resistance gene cluster (vanRO), aminocoumarin resistance parY, and aminocoumarin self-resistance parY. While, antibiotic target protection mechanism included RbpA bacterial RNA polymerase (rpoB)-binding protein. The study supports the claim of the possible horizontal transfer of these ARGs to human gut and emergence of new multidrug resistant clinical isolates. Thus, careful agricultural practices are required especially for plants used in circles of human nutrition industry or in traditional medicine."
Ψ-Footprinting approach for the identification of protein synthesis inhibitor producers.,35855324,"Today, one of the biggest challenges in antibiotic research is a targeted prioritization of natural compound producer strains and an efficient dereplication process to avoid undesired rediscovery of already known substances. Thereby, genome sequence-driven mining strategies are often superior to wet-lab experiments because they are generally faster and less resource-intensive. In the current study, we report on the development of a novel in silico screening approach to evaluate the genetic potential of bacterial strains to produce protein synthesis inhibitors (PSI), which was termed the protein synthesis inhibitor ('psi') target gene footprinting approach = Ψ-footprinting. The strategy is based on the occurrence of protein synthesis associated self-resistance genes in genome sequences of natural compound producers. The screening approach was applied to 406 genome sequences of actinomycetes strains from the DSMZ strain collection, resulting in the prioritization of 15 potential PSI producer strains. For twelve of them, extract samples showed protein synthesis inhibitory properties in in vitro transcription/translation assays. For four strains, namely Saccharopolyspora flava DSM 44771, Micromonospora aurantiaca DSM 43813, Nocardioides albertanoniae DSM 25218, and Geodermatophilus nigrescens DSM 45408, the protein synthesis inhibitory substance amicoumacin was identified by HPLC-MS analysis, which proved the functionality of the in silico screening approach."
The structural and functional divergence of a neglected three-finger toxin subfamily in lethal elapids.,35830808,"Bungarus multicinctus is a widely distributed and medically important elapid snake that produces lethal neurotoxic venom. To study and enhance existing antivenom, we explore the complete repertoire of its toxin genes based on de novo chromosome-level assembly and multi-tissue transcriptome data. Comparative genomic analyses suggest that the three-finger toxin family (3FTX) may evolve through the neofunctionalization of flanking LY6E. A long-neglected 3FTX subfamily (i.e., MKA-3FTX) is also investigated. Only one MKA-3FTX gene, which evolves a different protein conformation, is under positive selection and actively transcribed in the venom gland, functioning as a major toxin effector together with MKT-3FTX subfamily homologs. Furthermore, this lethal snake may acquire self-resistance to its β-bungarotoxin via amino acid replacements on fast-evolving KCNA2. This study provides valuable resources for further evolutionary and structure-function studies of snake toxins, which are fundamental for the development of effective antivenoms and drug candidates."
"Penicillin-Binding Proteins, β-Lactamases, and β-Lactamase Inhibitors in β-Lactam-Producing Actinobacteria: Self-Resistance Mechanisms.",35628478,"The human society faces a serious problem due to the widespread resistance to antibiotics in clinical practice. Most antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters in actinobacteria contain genes for intrinsic self-resistance to the produced antibiotics, and it has been proposed that the antibiotic resistance genes in pathogenic bacteria originated in antibiotic-producing microorganisms. The model actinobacteria Streptomyces clavuligerus produces the β-lactam antibiotic cephamycin C, a class A β-lactamase, and the β lactamases inhibitor clavulanic acid, all of which are encoded in a gene supercluster; in addition, it synthesizes the β-lactamase inhibitory protein BLIP. The secreted clavulanic acid has a synergistic effect with the cephamycin produced by the same strain in the fight against competing microorganisms in its natural habitat. High levels of resistance to cephamycin/cephalosporin in actinobacteria are due to the presence (in their β-lactam clusters) of genes encoding PBPs which bind penicillins but not cephalosporins. We have revised the previously reported cephamycin C and clavulanic acid gene clusters and, in addition, we have searched for novel β-lactam gene clusters in protein databases. Notably, in S. clavuligerus and Nocardia lactamdurans, the β-lactamases are retained in the cell wall and do not affect the intracellular formation of isopenicillin N/penicillin N. The activity of the β-lactamase in S. clavuligerus may be modulated by the β-lactamase inhibitory protein BLIP at the cell-wall level. Analysis of the β-lactam cluster in actinobacteria suggests that these clusters have been moved by horizontal gene transfer between different actinobacteria and have culminated in S. clavuligerus with the organization of an elaborated set of genes designed for fine tuning of antibiotic resistance and cell wall remodeling for the survival of this Streptomyces species. This article is focused specifically on the enigmatic connection between β-lactam biosynthesis and β-lactam resistance mechanisms in the producer actinobacteria."
Mycothiol Peroxidase Activity as a Part of the Self-Resistance Mechanisms against the Antitumor Antibiotic Cosmomycin D.,35510858,"Antibiotic-producing microorganisms usually require one or more self-resistance determinants to survive antibiotic production. The effectors of these mechanisms are proteins that inactivate the antibiotic, facilitate its transport, or modify the target to render it insensitive to the molecule. Streptomyces bacteria biosynthesize various bioactive natural products and possess resistance systems for most metabolites, which are coregulated with antibiotic biosynthesis genes. Streptomyces olindensis strain DAUFPE 5622 produces the antitumor antibiotic cosmomycin D (COSD), a member of the anthracycline family. In this study, we propose three self-resistance mechanisms, anchored or based in the COSD biosynthetic gene cluster. These include cosIJ (an ABC transporter), cosU (a UvrA class IIa protein), and a new self-resistance mechanism encoded by cosP, which shows response against peroxides by the enzyme mycothiol peroxidase (MPx). Activity-based investigations of MPx and its mutant enzyme confirmed peroxidation during the production of COSD. Overexpression of the ABC transporter, the UvrA class IIa protein, and the MPx led to an effective response against toxic anthracyclines, such as cosmomycins. Our findings help to understand how thiol peroxidases play an antioxidant role in the anthracycline producer S. olindensis DAUFPE 5622, a mechanism which has been reported for neoplastic cells that are resistant to doxorubicin (DOX). IMPORTANCE Anthracycline compounds are DNA intercalating agents widely used in cancer chemotherapeutic protocols. This work focused on the self-resistance mechanisms developed by the cosmomycin-producing bacterium Streptomyces olindensis. Our findings showed that cysteine peroxidases, such as mycothiol peroxidase, encoded by the gene cosP, protected S. olindensis against peroxidation during cosmomycin production. This observation can contribute to much better understanding of resistance both in the producers, eventually enhancing production, and in some tumoral cell lines."
Molecular basis of antibiotic self-resistance in a bee larvae pathogen.,35487884,"Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of the devastating honey-bee disease American Foulbrood, produces the cationic polyketide-peptide hybrid paenilamicin that displays antibacterial and antifungal activity. Its biosynthetic gene cluster contains a gene coding for the N-acetyltransferase PamZ. We show that PamZ acts as self-resistance factor in Paenibacillus larvae by deactivation of paenilamicin. Using tandem mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and synthetic diastereomers, we identified the N-terminal amino group of the agmatinamic acid as the N-acetylation site. These findings highlight the pharmacophore region of paenilamicin, which we very recently identified as a ribosome inhibitor. Here, we further determined the crystal structure of PamZ:acetyl-CoA complex at 1.34 Å resolution. An unusual tandem-domain architecture provides a well-defined substrate-binding groove decorated with negatively-charged residues to specifically attract the cationic paenilamicin. Our results will help to understand the mode of action of paenilamicin and its role in pathogenicity of Paenibacillus larvae to fight American Foulbrood."
Resistance-Guided Mining of Bacterial Genotoxins Defines a Family of DNA Glycosylases.,35311535,"Unique DNA repair enzymes that provide self-resistance against therapeutically important, genotoxic natural products have been discovered in bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Among these, the DNA glycosylase AlkZ is essential for azinomycin B production and belongs to the HTH_42 superfamily of uncharacterized proteins. Despite their widespread existence in antibiotic producers and pathogens, the roles of these proteins in production of other natural products are unknown. Here, we determine the evolutionary relationship and genomic distribution of all HTH_42 proteins from Streptomyces and use a resistance-based genome mining approach to identify homologs associated with known and uncharacterized BGCs. We find that AlkZ-like (AZL) proteins constitute one distinct HTH_42 subfamily and are highly enriched in BGCs and variable in sequence, suggesting each has evolved to protect against a specific secondary metabolite. As a validation of the approach, we show that the AZL protein, HedH4, associated with biosynthesis of the alkylating agent hedamycin, excises hedamycin-DNA adducts with exquisite specificity and provides resistance to the natural product in cells. We also identify a second, phylogenetically and functionally distinct subfamily whose proteins are never associated with BGCs, are highly conserved with respect to sequence and genomic neighborhood, and repair DNA lesions not associated with a particular natural product. This work delineates two related families of DNA repair enzymes-one specific for complex alkyl-DNA lesions and involved in self-resistance to antimicrobials and the other likely involved in protection against an array of genotoxins-and provides a framework for targeted discovery of new genotoxic compounds with therapeutic potential. IMPORTANCE Bacteria are rich sources of secondary metabolites that include DNA-damaging genotoxins with antitumor/antibiotic properties. Although Streptomyces produce a diverse number of therapeutic genotoxins, efforts toward targeted discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) producing DNA-damaging agents is lacking. Moreover, work on toxin-resistance genes has lagged behind our understanding of those involved in natural product synthesis. Here, we identified over 70 uncharacterized BGCs producing potentially novel genotoxins through resistance-based genome mining using the azinomycin B-resistance DNA glycosylase AlkZ. We validate our analysis by characterizing the enzymatic activity and cellular resistance of one AlkZ ortholog in the BGC of hedamycin, a potent DNA alkylating agent. Moreover, we uncover a second, phylogenetically distinct family of proteins related to Escherichia coli YcaQ, a DNA glycosylase capable of unhooking interstrand DNA cross-links, which differs from the AlkZ-like family in sequence, genomic location, proximity to BGCs, and substrate specificity. This work defines two families of DNA glycosylase for specialized repair of complex genotoxic natural products and generalized repair of a broad range of alkyl-DNA adducts and provides a framework for targeted discovery of new compounds with therapeutic potential."
The Odilorhabdin Antibiotic Biosynthetic Cluster and Acetyltransferase Self-Resistance Locus Are Niche and Species Specific.,35012352,"Antibiotic resistance is an increasing threat to human health. A direct link has been established between antimicrobial self-resistance determinants of antibiotic producers, environmental bacteria, and clinical pathogens. Natural odilorhabdins (ODLs) constitute a new family of 10-mer linear cationic peptide antibiotics inhibiting bacterial translation by binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome. These bioactive secondary metabolites are produced by entomopathogenic bacterial symbiont Xenorhabdus (Morganellaceae), vectored by the soil-dwelling nematodes. ODL-producing Xenorhabdus nematophila symbionts have mechanisms of self-protection. In this study, we cloned the 44.5-kb odl biosynthetic gene cluster (odl-BGC) of the symbiont by recombineering and showed that the N-acetyltransferase-encoding gene, oatA, is responsible for ODL resistance. In vitro acetylation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses showed that OatA targeted the side chain amino group of ODL rare amino acids, leading to a loss of translation inhibition and antibacterial properties. Functional, genomic, and phylogenetic analyses of oatA revealed an exclusive cis-link to the odilorhabdin BGC, found only in X. nematophila and a specific phylogenetic clade of Photorhabdus. This work highlights the coevolution of antibiotic production and self-resistance as ancient features of this unique tripartite complex of host-vector-symbiont interactions without odl-BGC dissemination by lateral gene transfer. IMPORTANCE Odilorhabdins (ODLs) constitute a novel antibiotic family with promising properties for treating problematic multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. ODLs are 10-mer linear cationic peptides inhibiting bacterial translation by binding to the small subunit of the ribosome. These natural peptides are produced by Xenorhabdus nematophila, a bacterial symbiont of entomopathogenic nematodes well known to produce large amounts of specialized secondary metabolites. Like other antimicrobial producers, ODL-producing Xenorhabdus nematophila has mechanisms of self-protection. In this study, we cloned the ODL-biosynthetic gene cluster of the symbiont by recombineering and showed that the N-acetyltransferase-encoding gene, oatA, is responsible for ODL resistance. In vitro acetylation and LC-MS/MS analyses showed that OatA targeted the side chain amino group of ODL rare amino acids, leading to a loss of translation inhibition and antibacterial properties. Functional, genomic, and phylogenetic analyses of oatA revealed the coevolution of antibiotic production and self-resistance as ancient feature of this particular niche in soil invertebrates without resistance dissemination."
Dual-Mechanism Confers Self-Resistance to the Antituberculosis Antibiotic Capreomycin.,34994196,"Capreomycin (CMN) is an important second-line antituberculosis antibiotic isolated from Saccharothrix mutabilis subspecies capreolus. The gene cluster for CMN biosynthesis has been identified and sequenced, wherein the cph gene was annotated as a phosphotransferase likely engaging in self-resistance. Previous studies reported that Cph inactivates two CMNs, CMN IA and IIA, by phosphorylation. We, herein, report that (1) Escherichia coli harboring the cph gene becomes resistant to both CMN IIA and IIB, (2) phylogenetic analysis regroups Cph to a new clade in the phosphotransferase protein family, (3) Cph shares a three-dimensional structure akin to the aminoglycoside phosphotransferases with a high binding affinity (KD) to both CMN IIA and IIB at micromolar levels, and (4) Cph utilizes either ATP or GTP as a phosphate group donor transferring its γ-phosphate to the hydroxyl group of CMN IIA. Until now, Cph and Vph (viomycin phosphotransferase) are the only two known enzymes inactivating peptide-based antibiotics through phosphorylation. Our biochemical characterization and structural determination conclude that Cph confers the gene-carrying species resistance to CMN by means of either chemical modification or physical sequestration, a naturally manifested belt and braces strategy. These findings add a new chapter into the self-resistance of bioactive natural products, which is often overlooked while designing new bioactive molecules."
Structural evolution of a DNA repair self-resistance mechanism targeting genotoxic secondary metabolites.,34836957,"Microbes produce a broad spectrum of antibiotic natural products, including many DNA-damaging genotoxins. Among the most potent of these are DNA alkylating agents in the spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone (SCPCHD) family, which includes the duocarmycins, CC-1065, gilvusmycin, and yatakemycin. The yatakemycin biosynthesis cluster in Streptomyces sp. TP-A0356 contains an AlkD-related DNA glycosylase, YtkR2, that serves as a self-resistance mechanism against yatakemycin toxicity. We previously reported that AlkD, which is not present in an SCPCHD producer, provides only limited resistance against yatakemycin. We now show that YtkR2 and C10R5, a previously uncharacterized homolog found in the CC-1065 biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces zelensis, confer far greater resistance against their respective SCPCHD natural products. We identify a structural basis for substrate specificity across gene clusters and show a correlation between in vivo resistance and in vitro enzymatic activity indicating that reduced product affinity-not enhanced substrate recognition-is the evolutionary outcome of selective pressure to provide self-resistance against yatakemycin and CC-1065."
Monooxygenase LaPhzX is Involved in Self-Resistance Mechanisms during the Biosynthesis of N-Oxide Phenazine Myxin.,34735148,"Self-resistance genes are deployed by many microbial producers of bioactive natural products to avoid self-toxicity. Myxin, a di-N-oxide phenazine produced by Lysobacter antibioticus OH13, is toxic to many microorganisms and tumor cells. Here, we uncovered a self-defense strategy featuring the antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase (ABM) family protein LaPhzX for myxin degradation. The gene LaPhzX is located in the myxin biosynthetic gene cluster (LaPhz), and its deletion resulted in bacterial mutants that are more sensitive to myxin. In addition, the LaPhzX mutants showed increased myxin accumulation and reduction of its derivative, compound 4, compared to the wild-type strain. Meanwhile, in vitro biochemical assays demonstrated that LaPhzX significantly degraded myxin in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). In addition, heterologous expression of LaPhzX in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Escherichia coli increased their resistance to myxin. Overall, our work illustrates a monooxygenase-mediated self-resistance mechanism for phenazine antibiotic biosynthesis."
ARTS-DB: a database for antibiotic resistant targets.,34718689,"As a result of the continuous evolution of drug resistant bacteria, new antibiotics are urgently needed. Encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), antibiotic compounds are mostly produced by bacteria. With the exponential increase in the number of publicly available, sequenced genomes and the advancements of BGC prediction tools, genome mining algorithms have uncovered millions of uncharacterized BGCs for further evaluation. Since compound identification and characterization remain bottlenecks, a major challenge is prioritizing promising BGCs. Recently, researchers adopted self-resistance based strategies allowing them to predict the biological activities of natural products encoded by uncharacterized BGCs. Since 2017, the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS) facilitated this so-called target-directed genome mining (TDGM) approach for the prioritization of BGCs encoding potentially novel antibiotics. Here, we present the ARTS database, available at https://arts-db.ziemertlab.com/. The ARTS database provides pre-computed ARTS results for >70,000 genomes and metagenome assembled genomes in total. Advanced search queries allow users to rapidly explore the fundamental criteria of TDGM such as BGC proximity, duplication and horizontal gene transfers of essential housekeeping genes. Furthermore, the ARTS database provides results interconnected throughout the bacterial kingdom as well as links to known databases in natural product research."
Improved broad-spectrum antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens via darobactin biosynthetic pathway engineering.,34659729,"The development of new antibiotics is imperative to fight increasing mortality rates connected to infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. In this context, Gram-negative pathogens listed in the WHO priority list are particularly problematic. Darobactin is a ribosomally produced and post-translationally modified bicyclic heptapeptide antibiotic selectively killing Gram-negative bacteria by targeting the outer membrane protein BamA. The native darobactin A producer Photorhabdus khanii HGB1456 shows very limited production under laboratory cultivation conditions. Herein, we present the design and heterologous expression of a synthetically engineered darobactin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in Escherichia coli to reach an average darobactin A production titre of 13.4 mg L-1. Rational design of darA variants, encoding the darobactin precursor peptide with altered core sequences, resulted in the production of 13 new 'non-natural' darobactin derivatives and 4 previously hypothetical natural darobactins. One of the non-natural compounds, darobactin 9, was more potent than darobactin A, and showed significantly improved activity especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.125 μg mL-1) and Acinetobacter baumannii (1-2 μg mL-1). Importantly, it also displayed superior activity against MDR clinical isolates of E. coli (1-2 μg mL-1) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1-4 μg mL-1). Independent deletions of genes from the darobactin BGC showed that only darA and darE, encoding a radical forming S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent enzyme, are required for darobactin formation. Co-expression of two additional genes associated with the BGCs in hypothetical producer strains identified a proteolytic detoxification mechanism as a potential self-resistance strategy in native producers. Taken together, we describe a versatile heterologous darobactin platform allowing the production of unprecedented active derivatives in good yields, and we provide first experimental evidence for darobactin biosynthesis processes."
Beyond Self-Resistance: ABCF ATPase LmrC Is a Signal-Transducing Component of an Antibiotic-Driven Signaling Cascade Accelerating the Onset of Lincomycin Biosynthesis.,34488446,"In natural environments, antibiotics are important means of interspecies competition. At subinhibitory concentrations, they act as cues or signals inducing antibiotic production; however, our knowledge of well-documented antibiotic-based sensing systems is limited. Here, for the soil actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis, we describe a fundamentally new ribosome-mediated signaling cascade that accelerates the onset of lincomycin production in response to an external ribosome-targeting antibiotic to synchronize antibiotic production within the population. The entire cascade is encoded in the lincomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and consists of three lincomycin resistance proteins in addition to the transcriptional regulator LmbU: a lincomycin transporter (LmrA), a 23S rRNA methyltransferase (LmrB), both of which confer high resistance, and an ATP-binding cassette family F (ABCF) ATPase, LmrC, which confers only moderate resistance but is essential for antibiotic-induced signal transduction. Specifically, antibiotic sensing occurs via ribosome-mediated attenuation, which activates LmrC production in response to lincosamide, streptogramin A, or pleuromutilin antibiotics. Then, ATPase activity of the ribosome-associated LmrC triggers the transcription of lmbU and consequently the expression of lincomycin BGC. Finally, the production of LmrC is downregulated by LmrA and LmrB, which reduces the amount of ribosome-bound antibiotic and thus fine-tunes the cascade. We propose that analogous ABCF-mediated signaling systems are relatively common because many ribosome-targeting antibiotic BGCs encode an ABCF protein accompanied by additional resistance protein(s) and transcriptional regulators. Moreover, we revealed that three of the eight coproduced ABCF proteins of S. lincolnensis are clindamycin responsive, suggesting that the ABCF-mediated antibiotic signaling may be a widely utilized tool for chemical communication. IMPORTANCE Resistance proteins are perceived as mechanisms protecting bacteria from the inhibitory effect of their produced antibiotics or antibiotics from competitors. Here, we report that antibiotic resistance proteins regulate lincomycin biosynthesis in response to subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. In particular, we show the dual character of the ABCF ATPase LmrC, which confers antibiotic resistance and simultaneously transduces a signal from ribosome-bound antibiotics to gene expression, where the 5' untranslated sequence upstream of its encoding gene functions as a primary antibiotic sensor. ABCF-mediated antibiotic signaling can in principle function not only in the induction of antibiotic biosynthesis but also in selective gene expression in response to any small molecules targeting the 50S ribosomal subunit, including clinically important antibiotics, to mediate intercellular antibiotic signaling and stress response induction. Moreover, the resistance-regulatory function of LmrC presented here for the first time unifies functionally inconsistent ABCF family members involving antibiotic resistance proteins and translational regulators."
Gene Conversion Facilitates the Adaptive Evolution of Self-Resistance in Highly Toxic Newts.,34129031,"Reconstructing the histories of complex adaptations and identifying the evolutionary mechanisms underlying their origins are two of the primary goals of evolutionary biology. Taricha newts, which contain high concentrations of the deadly toxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) as an antipredator defense, have evolved resistance to self-intoxication, which is a complex adaptation requiring changes in six paralogs of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) gene family, the physiological target of TTX. Here, we reconstruct the origins of TTX self-resistance by sequencing the entire Nav gene family in newts and related salamanders. We show that moderate TTX resistance evolved early in the salamander lineage in three of the six Nav paralogs, preceding the proposed appearance of tetrodotoxic newts by ∼100 My. TTX-bearing newts possess additional unique substitutions across the entire Nav gene family that provide physiological TTX resistance. These substitutions coincide with signatures of positive selection and relaxed purifying selection, as well as gene conversion events, that together likely facilitated their evolution. We also identify a novel exon duplication within Nav1.4 encoding an expressed TTX-binding site. Two resistance-conferring changes within newts appear to have spread via nonallelic gene conversion: in one case, one codon was copied between paralogs, and in the second, multiple substitutions were homogenized between the duplicate exons of Nav1.4. Our results demonstrate that gene conversion can accelerate the coordinated evolution of gene families in response to a common selection pressure."
The sporothriolides. A new biosynthetic family of fungal secondary metabolites.,34123230,"The biosynthetic gene cluster of the antifungal metabolite sporothriolide 1 was identified from three producing ascomycetes: Hypomontagnella monticulosa MUCL 54604, H. spongiphila CLL 205 and H. submonticulosa DAOMC 242471. A transformation protocol was established, and genes encoding a fatty acid synthase subunit and a citrate synthase were simultaneously knocked out which led to loss of sporothriolide and sporochartine production. In vitro reactions showed that the sporochartines are derived from non-enzymatic Diels-Alder cycloaddition of 1 and trienylfuranol A 7 during the fermentation and extraction process. Heterologous expression of the spo genes in Aspergillus oryzae then led to the production of intermediates and shunts and delineation of a new fungal biosynthetic pathway originating in fatty acid biosynthesis. Finally, a hydrolase was revealed by in vitro studies likely contributing towards self-resistance of the producer organism."
Structural Basis for the Interactions of the Colibactin Resistance Gene Product ClbS with DNA.,33945270,"The natural product colibactin, along with its associated biosynthetic gene cluster, is an example system for the role microbially derived small molecules play in the human microbiome. This is particularly relevant in the human gut, where host microbiota is involved in various disorders, including colorectal cancer pathogenesis. Bacteria harboring the colibactin gene cluster induce alkylation of nucleobases in host DNA, forming interstrand cross-links both in vivo and in vitro. These lesions can lead to deleterious double-strand breaks and have been identified as the primary mechanism of colibactin-induced cytotoxicity. The gene product ClbS is one of several mechanisms utilized by the producing bacteria to maintain genome integrity. ClbS catalyzes hydrolytic inactivation of colibactin and has been shown to bind DNA, incurring self-resistance. Presented is the molecular basis for ClbS bound to a DNA oligonucleotide. The structure shows the interaction of the protein with the ends of a DNA duplex with terminal nucleotides flipped to the enzyme active site. The structure suggests an additional function for ClbS, the binding to damaged DNA followed by repair. Additionally, our study provides general insight into the function of the widely distributed and largely uncharacterized DUF1706 protein family."
Targeted Genome Mining Reveals the Biosynthetic Gene Clusters of Natural Product CYP51 Inhibitors.,33857369,"Lanosterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) is an important target in the development of antifungal drugs. The fungal-derived restricticin 1 and related molecules are the only examples of natural products that inhibit CYP51. Here, using colocalizations of genes encoding self-resistant CYP51 as the query, we identified and validated the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of 1. Additional genome mining of related BGCs with CYP51 led to production of the related lanomycin 2. The pathways for both 1 and 2 were identified from fungi not known to produce these compounds, highlighting the promise of the self-resistance enzyme (SRE) guided approach to bioactive natural product discovery."
Redox Modifications in the Biosynthesis of Alchivemycin A Enable the Formation of Its Key Pharmacophore.,33736434,"Redox enzymes play a critical role in transforming nascent scaffolds into structurally complex and biologically active natural products. Alchivemycin A (AVM, 1) is a highly oxidized polycyclic compound with potent antimicrobial activity and features a rare 2H-tetrahydro-4,6-dioxo-1,2-oxazine (TDO) ring system. The scaffold of AVM has previously been shown to be biosynthesized by a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) pathway. In this study, we present a postassembly secondary metabolic network involving six redox enzymes that leads to AVM formation. We characterize this complex redox network using in vivo gene deletions, in vitro biochemical assays, and one-pot enzymatic total synthesis. Importantly, we show that an FAD-dependent monooxygenase catalyzes oxygen insertion into an amide bond to form the key TDO ring in AVM, an unprecedented function of flavoenzymes. We also show that the TDO ring is essential to the antimicrobial activity of AVM, likely through targeting the β-subunit of RNA polymerase. As further evidence, we show that AvmK, a β-subunit of RNA synthase, can confer self-resistance to AVM via target modification. Our findings expand the repertoire of functions of flavoenzymes and provide insight into antimicrobial and biocatalyst development based on AVM."
"Selective Isolation of Multidrug-Resistant Pedobacter spp., Producers of Novel Antibacterial Peptides.",33717041,"Twenty-eight multidrug-resistant bacterial strains closely related or identical to Pedobacter cryoconitis, Pedobacter lusitanus and Pedobacter steynii were isolated from soil samples by selection for multidrug-resistance. Approximately 3-30% of the selected isolates were identified as Pedobacter, whereas isolation without antibiotics did not yield any isolates of this genus. Next generation sequencing data showed Pedobacter to be on 69th place among the bacterial genera (0.32% of bacterial sequences). The Pedobacter isolates produced a wide array of novel compounds when screened by UHPLC-MS/MSMS, and hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in several distinct clusters of compounds produced by specific isolates of Pedobacter, and most of these compounds were found to be peptides. The Pedobacter strain UP508 produced isopedopeptins, whereas another set of strains produced pedopeptins, which both are known cyclic lipodepsipeptides produced by Pedobacter sp. Other Pedobacter strains produced analogous peptides with a sequence variation. Further strains of Pedobacter produced additional novel antibacterial cyclic lipopeptides (ca 800 or 1400 Da in size) and/or linear lipopeptides (ca 700-960 Da in size). A 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree for the Pedobacter isolates revealed several distinct clades and subclades of isolates. One of the subclades comprised isolates producing isopedopeptin analogs, but the isopedopeptin producing isolate UP508 was clearly placed on a separate branch. We suggest that the non-ribosomal peptide synthases producing pedopeptins, isopedopeptins, and the analogous peptides, may derive from a common ancestral non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene cluster, which may have been subjected to a mutation leading to changed specificity in one of the modules and then to a modular rearrangement leading to the changed sequence found in the isopedopeptins produced by isolate UP508."
"Resistance-Nodulation-Division Efflux Pump, LexABC, Contributes to Self-Resistance of the Phenazine Di-N-Oxide Natural Product Myxin in Lysobacter antibioticus.",33679640,"Antibiotic-producing microorganisms have developed several self-resistance mechanisms to protect them from autotoxicity. Transporters belonging to the resistance- nodulation-division (RND) superfamily commonly confer multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. Phenazines are heterocyclic, nitrogen-containing and redox-active compounds that exhibit diverse activities. We previously identified six phenazines from Lysobacter antibioticus OH13, a soil bacterium emerging as a potential biocontrol agent. Among these phenazines, myxin, a di-N-oxide phenazine, exhibited potent activity against a variety of microorganisms. In this study, we identified a novel RND efflux pump gene cluster, designated lexABC, which is located far away in the genome from the myxin biosynthesis gene cluster. We found a putative LysR-type transcriptional regulator encoding gene lexR, which was adjacent to lexABC. Deletion of lexABC or lexR gene resulted in significant increasing susceptibility of strains to myxin and loss of myxin production. The results demonstrated that LexABC pump conferred resistance against myxin. The myxin produced at lower concentrations in these mutants was derivatized by deoxidation and O-methylation. Furthermore, we found that the abolishment of myxin with deletion of LaPhzB, which is an essential gene in myxin biosynthesis, resulted in significant downregulation of the lexABC. However, exogenous supplementation with myxin to LaPhzB mutant could efficiently induce the expression of lexABC genes. Moreover, lexR mutation also led to decreased expression of lexABC, which indicates that LexR potentially positively modulated the expression of lexABC. Our findings reveal a resistance mechanism against myxin of L. antibioticus, which coordinates regulatory pathways to protect itself from autotoxicity."
Cryptic phosphorylation in nucleoside natural product biosynthesis.,33257873,"Kinases are annotated in many nucleoside biosynthetic gene clusters but generally are considered responsible only for self-resistance. Here, we report an unexpected 2'-phosphorylation of nucleoside biosynthetic intermediates in the nikkomycin and polyoxin pathways. This phosphorylation is a unique cryptic modification as it is introduced in the third of seven steps during aminohexuronic acid (AHA) nucleoside biosynthesis, retained throughout the pathway's duration, and is removed in the last step of the pathway. Bioinformatic analysis of reported nucleoside biosynthetic gene clusters indicates the presence of cryptic phosphorylation in other pathways and the importance of functional characterization of kinases in nucleoside biosynthetic pathways in general. This study also functionally characterized all of the enzymes responsible for AHA biosynthesis and revealed that AHA is constructed via a unique oxidative C-C bond cleavage reaction. The results indicate a divergent biosynthetic mechanism for three classes of antifungal nucleoside natural products."
Resistance-Guided Discovery of Elfamycin Antibiotic Producers with Antigonococcal Activity.,33164482,"The rise of bacterial antibiotic resistance coupled with a diminished antibiotic drug pipeline underlines the importance of developing rational strategies to discover new antimicrobials. Microbially derived natural products are the basis for most of the antibiotic arsenal available to modern medicine. Here, we demonstrate a resistance-based approach to identify producers of elfamycins, an under-explored class of natural product antibiotics that target the essential translation factor EF-Tu. Antibiotic producers carry self-resistance genes to avoid suicide. These genes are often found within the same biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) responsible for making the antibiotic, and we exploited this trait to identify members of the kirromycin class of elfamycin producers. Genome mining of Streptomyces spp. led to the identification of three isolates that harbor kirromycin-resistant EF-Tu (EF-TuKirR) within predicted natural product BGCs. Activity-guided purification on extracts of one of the Streptomyces isolates, which was not known to produce an elfamycin, identified it as a producer of phenelfamycin B, a linear polyketide. Phenelfamycin B demonstrates impressive antibacterial activity (MIC ∼ 1 μg/mL) against multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a clinically important Gram negative pathogen. The antigonococcal activity of phenelfamycin was shown to be the result of inhibition of protein biosynthesis by binding to EF-Tu. These results indicate that a resistance-based approach of identifying elfamycin producers is translatable to other antibiotic classes that can identify new and overlooked antibiotics necessary to address the antibiotic crisis."
Structural and functional comparison of Saccharomonospora azurea strains in terms of primycin producing ability.,32989522,"Emerging and re-emerging microbial pathogens, together with their rapid evolution and adaptation against antibiotics, highlight the importance not only of screening for new antimicrobial agents, but also for deepening knowledge about existing antibiotics. Primycin is a large 36-membered non-polyene macrolide lactone exclusively produced by Saccharomonospora azurea. This study provides information about strain dependent primycin production ability in conjunction with the structural, functional and comparative genomic examinations. Comparison of high- and low-primycin producer strains, transcriptomic analysis identified a total of 686 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), classified into diverse Cluster of Orthologous Groups. Among them, genes related to fatty acid synthesis, self-resistance, regulation of secondary metabolism and agmatinase encoding gene responsible for catalyze conversion between guanidino/amino forms of primycin were discussed. Based on in silico data mining methods, we were able to identify DEGs whose altered expression provide a good starting point for the optimization of fermentation processes, in order to perform targeted strain improvement and rational drug design."
Identification of the Antifungal Metabolite Chaetoglobosin P From Discosia rubi Using a Cryptococcus neoformans Inhibition Assay: Insights Into Mode of Action and Biosynthesis.,32849391,"Cryptococcus neoformans is an important human pathogen with limited options for treatments. We have interrogated extracts from fungal fermentations to find Cryptococcus-inhibiting natural products using assays for growth inhibition, differential thermosensitivity, and synergy with existing antifungal drugs. Extracts from fermentations of strains of Discosia rubi from eastern Texas showed anticryptococcal bioactivity with preferential activity in agar zone of inhibition assays against C. neoformans at 37°C versus 25°C. Assay-guided fractionation led to the purification and identification of chaetoglobosin P as the active component of these extracts. Genome sequencing of these strains revealed a biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with chaetoglobosin biosynthesis and β-methylation of the tryptophan residue. Proximity of genes of the actin-binding protein twinfilin-1 to the chaetoglobosin P and K gene clusters suggested a possible self-resistance mechanism involving twinfilin-1 which is consistent with the predicted mechanism of action involving interference with the polymerization of the capping process of filamentous actin. A C. neoformans mutant lacking twinfilin-1 was hypersensitive to chaetoglobosin P. Chaetoglobosins also potentiated the effects of amphotericin B and caspofungin on C. neoformans."
Glycopeptide Antibiotic Resistance Genes: Distribution and Function in the Producer Actinomycetes.,32655512,"Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are considered drugs of ""last resort"" for the treatment of life-threatening infections caused by relevant Gram-positive pathogens (enterococci, staphylococci, and clostridia). Driven by the issue of the never-stopping evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance, research on GPA biosynthesis and resistance is developing fast in modern ""post-genomic"" era. It is today widely accepted that resistance mechanisms emerging in pathogens have been acquired from the soil-dwelling antibiotic-producing actinomycetes, which use them to avoid suicide during production, rather than being orchestrated de novo by pathogen bacteria upon continued treatment. Actually, more and more genomes of GPA producers are being unraveled, carrying a broad collection of differently arranged GPA resistance (named van) genes. In the producer actinomycetes, van genes are generally associated with the antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) deputed to GPA biosynthesis, being probably transferred/arranged together, favoring a possible co-regulation between antibiotic production and self-resistance. GPA BGC-associated van genes have been also found mining public databases of bacterial genomic and metagenomic sequences. Interestingly, some BGCs for antibiotics, seemingly unrelated to GPAs (e.g., feglymycin), carry van gene homologues. Herein, we would like to cover the recent advances on the distribution of GPA resistance genes in genomic and metagenomics datasets related to GPA potential/proved producer microorganisms. A thorough understanding of GPA resistance in the producing microorganisms may prove useful in the future surveillance of emerging mechanisms of resistance to this clinically relevant antibiotic class."
Acrophiarin (antibiotic S31794/F-1) from Penicillium arenicola shares biosynthetic features with both Aspergillus- and Leotiomycete-type echinocandins.,32239586,"The antifungal echinocandin lipopeptide, acrophiarin, was circumscribed in a patent in 1979. We confirmed that the producing strain NRRL 8095 is Penicillium arenicola and other strains of P. arenicola produced acrophiarin and acrophiarin analogues. Genome sequencing of NRRL 8095 identified the acrophiarin gene cluster. Penicillium arenicola and echinocandin-producing Aspergillus species belong to the family Aspergillaceae of the Eurotiomycetes, but several features of acrophiarin and its gene cluster suggest a closer relationship with echinocandins from Leotiomycete fungi. These features include hydroxy-glutamine in the peptide core instead of a serine or threonine residue, the inclusion of a non-heme iron, α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase for hydroxylation of the C3 of the glutamine, and a thioesterase. In addition, P. arenicola bears similarity to Leotiomycete echinocandin-producing species because it exhibits self-resistance to exogenous echinocandins. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes of the echinocandin biosynthetic family indicated that most of the predicted proteins of acrophiarin gene cluster exhibited higher similarity to the predicted proteins of the pneumocandin gene cluster of the Leotiomycete Glarea lozoyensis than to those of the echinocandin B gene cluster from A. pachycristatus. The fellutamide gene cluster and related gene clusters are recognized as relatives of the echinocandins. Inclusion of the acrophiarin gene cluster into a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of echinocandin gene clusters indicated the divergent evolutionary lineages of echinocandin gene clusters are descendants from a common ancestral progenitor. The minimal 10-gene cluster may have undergone multiple gene acquisitions or losses and possibly horizontal gene transfer after the ancestral separation of the two lineages."
Induction of secondary metabolite production by hygromycin B and identification of the 1233A biosynthetic gene cluster with a self-resistance gene.,32139880,"We found that the protein synthesis inhibitor hygromycin B induced the production of secondary metabolites, including lucilactaene, NG-391, fusarubin, 1233A, and 1233B, in the filamentous fungus, Fusarium sp. RK97-94. We identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for 1233A, an HMG-CoA synthase inhibitor. The biosynthetic gene cluster consisted of four genes, one of which was involved in conferring self-resistance to 1233A."
"Teicoplanin biosynthesis: unraveling the interplay of structural, regulatory, and resistance genes.",32076781,"Teicoplanin (Tcp) is a clinically relevant glycopeptide antibiotic (GPA) that is produced by the actinobacterium Actinoplanes teichomyceticus. Tcp is a front-line therapy for treating severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens in adults and infants. In this review, we provide a detailed overview of how Tcp is produced by A. teichomyceticus by describing Tcp biosynthesis, regulation, and resistance. We summarize the knowledge gained from in vivo and in vitro studies to provide an integrated model of teicoplanin biosynthesis. Then, we discuss genetic and nutritional factors that contribute to the regulation of teicoplanin biosynthesis, focusing on those that have been successfully applied for improving teicoplanin production. A current view on teicoplanin self-resistance mechanisms in A. teichomyceticus is given, and we compare the Tcp biosynthetic gene cluster with other glycopeptide gene clusters from actinoplanetes and from unidentified isolates/metagenomics samples. Finally, we provide an outlook for further directions in studying Tcp biosynthesis and regulation."
Comparative transcriptomic analysis reveals the significant pleiotropic regulatory effects of LmbU on lincomycin biosynthesis.,32050973,"Lincomycin, produced by Streptomyces lincolnensis, is a lincosamide antibiotic and widely used for the treatment of the infective diseases caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The mechanisms of lincomycin biosynthesis have been deeply explored in recent years. However, the regulatory effects of LmbU that is a transcriptional regulator in lincomycin biosynthetic (lmb) gene cluster have not been fully addressed."
Monasone Naphthoquinone Biosynthesis and Resistance in Monascus Fungi.,32019788,"Despite the important biological activities of natural product naphthoquinones, the biosynthetic pathways of and resistance mechanisms against such compounds remain poorly understood in fungi. Here, we report that the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of Monascus naphthoquinones (monasones) reside within the gene cluster for Monascus azaphilone pigments (MonAzPs). We elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of monasones by a combination of comparative genome analysis, gene knockouts, heterologous coexpression, and in vivo and in vitro enzymatic reactions to show that this pathway branches from the first polyketide intermediate of MonAzPs. Furthermore, we propose that the monasone subset of biosynthetic genes also encodes a two-tiered resistance strategy in which an inducible monasone-specific exporter expels monasones from the mycelia, while residual intracellular monasones may be rendered nontoxic through a multistep reduction cascade.IMPORTANCE The genes for Monascus naphthoquinone (monasone) biosynthesis are embedded in and form a composite supercluster with the Monascus azaphilone pigment biosynthetic gene cluster. Early biosynthetic intermediates are shared by the two pathways. Some enzymes encoded by the supercluster play double duty in contributing to both pathways, while others are specific for one or the other pathway. The monasone subcluster is independently regulated and inducible by elicitation with competing microorganisms. This study illustrates genomic and biosynthetic parsimony in fungi and proposes a potential path for the evolution of the mosaic-like azaphilone-naphthoquinone supercluster. The monasone subcluster also encodes a two-tiered self-resistance mechanism that models resistance determinants that may transfer to target microorganisms or emerge in cancer cells in case of naphthoquinone-type cytotoxic agents."
Recent developments in self-resistance gene directed natural product discovery.,31912842,"Covering: 2000 to 2019Natural products (NPs) are important sources of human therapeutic agents and pesticides. To prevent self-harm from bioactive NPs, some microbial producers employ self-resistance genes to protect themselves. One effective strategy is to employ a self-resistance enzyme (SRE), which is a slightly mutated version of the original metabolic enzyme, and is resistant to the toxic NP but is still functional. The presence of a SRE in a gene cluster can serve as a predictive window to the biological activity of the NPs synthesized by the pathway. In this highlight, we summarize representative examples of NP biosynthetic pathways that utilize self-resistance genes for protection. Recent discoveries based on self-resistance gene identification have helped in bridging the gap between activity-guided and genome-driven approaches for NP discovery and functional assignment."
Three putative DNA replication/repair elements encoding genes confer self-resistance to distamycin in Streptomyces netropsis.,31833535,"Distamycin (DST) is a well-characterized DNA minor groove binder with antivirus activity and antitumor potency. Two separate gene clusters (a 28-kb cluster and a 7-kb cluster) have recently been identified to coordinately encode the biosynthetic machinery of DST in Streptomyces netropsis. Here we report a gene cassette, which is linked to the aforementioned smaller dst gene cluster and plays an important role in the self-resistance to DST in S. netropsis. This cassette consists of three uncharacterized genes that might be implicated in DNA replication/repair. Knockout of the cassette led to the decrease in the production of DST, while heterologous expression of part of the cassette in S. lividans made it become resistant to both DST and mitomycin C, another DNA-binding agent. More interestingly, homologs of these three genes were found in genomes of other actinomyces that produce DNA-binding antibiotics, suggesting that a novel common mechanism in addition to pumping may enable these strains to resist the cytotoxic metabolites they produced."
Divergent Biosynthesis of C-Nucleoside Minimycin and Indigoidine in Bacteria.,31816530,"Minimycin (MIN) is a C-nucleoside antibiotic structurally related to pseudouridine, and indigoidine is a naturally occurring blue pigment produced by diverse bacteria. Although MIN and indigoidine have been known for decades, the logic underlying the divergent biosynthesis of these interesting molecules has been obscure. Here, we report the identification of a minimal 5-gene cluster (min) essential for MIN biosynthesis. We demonstrated that a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (MinA) governs ""the switch"" for the divergent biosynthesis of MIN and the cryptic indigoidine. We also demonstrated that MinCN (the N-terminal phosphatase domain of MinC), MinD (uracil phosphoribosyltransferase), and MinT (transporter) function together as the safeguard enzymes, which collaboratively constitute an unusual self-resistance system. Finally, we provided evidence that MinD, utilizing an unprecedented substrate-competition strategy for self-resistance of the producer cell, maintains competition advantage over the active molecule MIN-5'-monophosphate by increasing the UMP pool in vivo. These findings greatly expand our knowledge regarding natural product biosynthesis."
Comparison of Antibiotic Resistance Mechanisms in Antibiotic-Producing and Pathogenic Bacteria.,31546630,"Antibiotic resistance poses a tremendous threat to human health. To overcome this problem, it is essential to know the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in antibiotic-producing and pathogenic bacteria. This paper deals with this problem from four points of view. First, the antibiotic resistance genes in producers are discussed related to their biosynthesis. Most resistance genes are present within the biosynthetic gene clusters, but some genes such as paromomycin acetyltransferases are located far outside the gene cluster. Second, when the antibiotic resistance genes in pathogens are compared with those in the producers, resistance mechanisms have dependency on antibiotic classes, and, in addition, new types of resistance mechanisms such as Eis aminoglycoside acetyltransferase and self-sacrifice proteins in enediyne antibiotics emerge in pathogens. Third, the relationships of the resistance genes between producers and pathogens are reevaluated at their amino acid sequence as well as nucleotide sequence levels. Pathogenic bacteria possess other resistance mechanisms than those in antibiotic producers. In addition, resistance mechanisms are little different between early stage of antibiotic use and the present time, e.g., β-lactam resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Lastly, guanine + cytosine (GC) barrier in gene transfer to pathogenic bacteria is considered. Now, the resistance genes constitute resistome composed of complicated mixture from divergent environments."
The ADEP Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Streptomyces hawaiiensis NRRL 15010 Reveals an Accessory clpP Gene as a Novel Antibiotic Resistance Factor.,31399403,"The increasing threat posed by multiresistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the discovery of novel antibacterials with unprecedented modes of action. ADEP1, a natural compound produced by Streptomyces hawaiiensis NRRL 15010, is the prototype for a new class of acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics. ADEP antibiotics deregulate the proteolytic core ClpP of the bacterial caseinolytic protease, thereby exhibiting potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens. ADEP1 and derivatives, here collectively called ADEP, have been previously investigated for their antibiotic potency against different species, structure-activity relationship, and mechanism of action; however, knowledge on the biosynthesis of the natural compound and producer self-resistance have remained elusive. In this study, we identified and analyzed the ADEP biosynthetic gene cluster in S. hawaiiensis NRRL 15010, which comprises two NRPSs, genes necessary for the biosynthesis of (4S,2R)-4-methylproline, and a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) for the assembly of highly reduced polyenes. While no resistance factor could be identified within the gene cluster itself, we discovered an additional clpP homologous gene (named clpPADEP) located further downstream of the biosynthetic genes, separated from the biosynthetic gene cluster by several transposable elements. Heterologous expression of ClpPADEP in three ADEP-sensitive Streptomyces species proved its role in conferring ADEP resistance, thereby revealing a novel type of antibiotic resistance determinant.IMPORTANCE Antibiotic acyldepsipeptides (ADEPs) represent a promising new class of potent antibiotics and, at the same time, are valuable tools to study the molecular functioning of their target, ClpP, the proteolytic core of the bacterial caseinolytic protease. Here, we present a straightforward purification procedure for ADEP1 that yields substantial amounts of the pure compound in a time- and cost-efficient manner, which is a prerequisite to conveniently study the antimicrobial effects of ADEP and the operating mode of bacterial ClpP machineries in diverse bacteria. Identification and characterization of the ADEP biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces hawaiiensis NRRL 15010 enables future bioinformatics screenings for similar gene clusters and/or subclusters to find novel natural compounds with specific substructures. Most strikingly, we identified a cluster-associated clpP homolog (named clpPADEP) as an ADEP resistance gene. ClpPADEP constitutes a novel bacterial resistance factor that alone is necessary and sufficient to confer high-level ADEP resistance to Streptomyces across species."
"Expression of the nirS, hzsA, and hdh genes and antibiotic resistance genes in response to recovery of anammox process inhibited by oxytetracycline.",31102817,"The inhibitory effects of oxytetracycline (OTC) on the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) performance were relieved by employing bio-augmentation (BA) tactics. However, the recovery mechanism was vague. The response of specific anammox activity (SAA), heme c, functional genes, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs) to OTC inhibition and BA aid were traced in the present study. The results indicated that response of SAA, heme c content and functional genes, such as nirS, hzsA and hdh to OTC inhibition were not synchronous. The presence of the tetC, tetG, tetX, and intI1 genes enhanced the resistance of anammox sludge to OTC, thus accelerating the performance recovery when aided by BA. A significant correlation existed between number of anammox 16S rRNA gene copies and protein level in the soluble microbial products (SMP), between tetG gene relative abundance and polysaccharose in SMP and between tetG gene relative abundance and protein in bound EPS (EPSs). In nutshell, the current findings provide the first description of a recovery mechanism regarding OTC-inhibited anammox performance aided by BA based on functional genes and highlights the contribution of ARGs and the self-resistance ability of EPS."
Regulation of teicoplanin biosynthesis: refining the roles of tei cluster-situated regulatory genes.,30937499,"Teicoplanin is a frontline glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Actinoplanes teichomyceticus. It is used to treat complicated cases of infection, including pediatric ones, caused by Gram-positive pathogens. There is a steady interest in elucidating the genetic mechanisms determining teicoplanin production, as they would help overproduce known teicoplanins and discover novel glycopeptides. Herein, we investigate the transcriptional organization of the tei biosynthetic gene cluster and the roles of the cluster-situated regulatory genes in controlling teicoplanin production and self-resistance in A. teichomyceticus. We demonstrate that the tei cluster is organized into nine polygenic and nine monogenic transcriptional units. Most of tei biosynthetic genes are subjected to StrR-like Tei15* control, which, in turn, appears to be regulated by LuxR-type Tei16*. Expression of the genes conferring teicoplanin self-resistance in A. teichomyceticus is not co-regulated with antibiotic production. The gene tei31*, coding for a putative DNA binding protein, is not expressed under teicoplanin producing conditions and is dispensable for antibiotic production. Finally, phylogenesis reconstruction of the glycopeptide cluster-encoded regulators reveals two main clades of StrR-like regulators. Tei15* and close orthologues form one of these clades; the second clade is composed by orthologues of Bbr and Dbv4, governing the biosynthesis of balhimycin and teicoplanin-like A40926, respectively. In addition, the LuxR-type Tei16* appears unrelated to the LuxR-like Dbv3, which is controlling A40926 biosynthesis. Our results shed new light on teicoplanin biosynthesis regulation and on the evolution of novel and old glycopeptide biosynthetic gene clusters."
Molecular Basis of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 Self-Resistance to the Phosphono-oligopeptide Antibiotic Rhizocticin.,30830751,"Rhizocticins are phosphono-oligopeptide antibiotics that contain a toxic C-terminal ( Z) -l -2-amino-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (APPA) moiety. APPA is an irreversible inhibitor of threonine synthase (ThrC), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of O-phospho-l-homoserine to l-threonine. ThrCs are essential for the viability of bacteria, plants, and fungi and are a target for antibiotic development, as de novo threonine biosynthetic pathway is not found in humans. Given the ability of APPA to interfere in threonine metabolism, it is unclear how the producing strain B. subtilis ATCC 6633 circumvents APPA toxicity. Notably, in addition to the housekeeping APPA-sensitive ThrC ( BsThrC), B. subtilis encodes a second threonine synthase (RhiB) encoded within the rhizocticin biosynthetic gene cluster. Kinetic and spectroscopic analyses show that PLP-dependent RhiB is an authentic threonine synthase, converting O-phospho-l-homoserine to threonine with a catalytic efficiency comparable to BsThrC. To understand the structural basis of inhibition, we determined the crystal structure of APPA bound to the housekeeping BsThrC, revealing a covalent complex between the inhibitor and PLP. Structure-based sequence analyses reveal structural determinants within the RhiB active site that contribute to rendering this ThrC homologue resistant to APPA. Together, this work establishes the self-resistance mechanism utilized by B. subtilis ATCC 6633 against APPA exemplifying one of many ways by which bacteria can overcome phosphonate toxicity."
"Antibiotic Resistance Mechanisms in Bacteria: Relationships Between Resistance Determinants of Antibiotic Producers, Environmental Bacteria, and Clinical Pathogens.",30555448,"Emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria poses a serious public health challenge worldwide. However, antibiotic resistance genes are not confined to the clinic; instead they are widely prevalent in different bacterial populations in the environment. Therefore, to understand development of antibiotic resistance in pathogens, we need to consider important reservoirs of resistance genes, which may include determinants that confer self-resistance in antibiotic producing soil bacteria and genes encoding intrinsic resistance mechanisms present in all or most non-producer environmental bacteria. While the presence of resistance determinants in soil and environmental bacteria does not pose a threat to human health, their mobilization to new hosts and their expression under different contexts, for example their transfer to plasmids and integrons in pathogenic bacteria, can translate into a problem of huge proportions, as discussed in this review. Selective pressure brought about by human activities further results in enrichment of such determinants in bacterial populations. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand distribution of resistance determinants in bacterial populations, elucidate resistance mechanisms, and determine environmental factors that promote their dissemination. This comprehensive review describes the major known self-resistance mechanisms found in producer soil bacteria of the genus Streptomyces and explores the relationships between resistance determinants found in producer soil bacteria, non-producer environmental bacteria, and clinical isolates. Specific examples highlighting potential pathways by which pathogenic clinical isolates might acquire these resistance determinants from soil and environmental bacteria are also discussed. Overall, this article provides a conceptual framework for understanding the complexity of the problem of emergence of antibiotic resistance in the clinic. Availability of such knowledge will allow researchers to build models for dissemination of resistance genes and for developing interventions to prevent recruitment of additional or novel genes into pathogens."
Genome mining reveals uncommon alkylpyrones as type III PKS products from myxobacteria.,30506464,"Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) are comparatively small homodimeric enzymes affording natural products with diverse structures and functions. While type III PKS biosynthetic pathways have been studied thoroughly in plants, their counterparts from bacteria and fungi are to date scarcely characterized. This gap is exemplified by myxobacteria from which no type III PKS-derived small molecule has previously been isolated. In this study, we conducted a genomic survey of myxobacterial type III PKSs and report the identification of uncommon alkylpyrones as the products of type III PKS biosynthesis from the myxobacterial model strain Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 through a self-resistance-guided screening approach focusing on genes encoding pentapetide repeat proteins, proficient to confer resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors. Using promoter-induced gene expression in the native host as well as heterologous expression of biosynthetic type III PKS genes, sufficient amounts of material could be obtained for structural elucidation and bioactivity testing, revealing potent topoisomerase activity in vitro."
Systematically engineering the biosynthesis of a green biosurfactant surfactin by Bacillus subtilis 168.,30453038,"The biosynthesis of surfactin has attracted broad interest; however, there is a bottleneck in its low yield in wild strains and the ability to engineer Bacillus producers. Because the key metabolic mechanisms in the surfactin synthesis pathway remain unclear, genetic engineering approaches are all ending up with a single or a few gene modifications. The aim of this study is to develop a systematic engineering approach to improve the biosynthesis of surfactin. First, we restored surfactin biosynthetic activity by integrating a complete sfp gene into the nonproducing Bacillus subtilis 168 strain and obtained a surfactin titer of 0.4 g/l. Second, we reduced competition by deleting biofilm formation-related genes and nonribosomal peptide synthetases/polyketide synthase pathways (3.8% of the total genome), which increased the surfactin titer by 3.3-fold. Third, we improved cellular tolerance to surfactin by overexpressing potential self-resistance-associated proteins, which further increased the surfactin titer by 8.5-fold. Fourth, we increased the supply of precursor branched-chain fatty acids by engineering the branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, resulting in an increase of the surfactin titer to 8.5 g/l (a 20.3-fold increase). Finally, due to the preference of the glycolytic pathway for cell growth, we diverted precursor acetyl-CoA away from cell growth to surfactin biosynthesis by enhancing the transcription of srfA. The final surfactin titer increased to 12.8 g/l, with a yield of 65.0 mmol/mol sucrose (42% of the theoretical yield) in the metabolically engineered strain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest titer and yield that has been reported. This study may pave the way for the commercial production of green surfactin. More broadly, our work presents another successful example of the modularization of metabolic pathways for improving titer and yield in biotechnological production."
Enfumafungin synthase represents a novel lineage of fungal triterpene cyclases.,30051576,"Enfumafungin is a glycosylated fernene-type triterpenoid produced by the fungus Hormonema carpetanum. Its potent antifungal activity, mediated by its interaction with β-1,3-glucan synthase and the fungal cell wall, has led to its development into the semi-synthetic clinical candidate, ibrexafungerp (=SCY-078). We report on the preliminary identification of the enfumafungin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) based on genome sequencing, phylogenetic reconstruction, gene disruption, and cDNA sequencing studies. Enfumafungin synthase (efuA) consists of a terpene cyclase domain (TC) fused to a glycosyltransferase (GT) domain and thus represents a novel multifunctional enzyme. Moreover, the TC domain bears a phylogenetic relationship to bacterial squalene-hopene cyclases (SHC) and includes a typical DXDD motif within the active centre suggesting that efuA evolved from SHCs. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the GT domain indicated that this portion of the fusion gene originated from fungal sterol GTs. Eleven genes flanking efuA are putatively involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, transport and self-resistance of enfumafungin and include an acetyltransferase, three P450 monooxygenases, a dehydrogenase, a desaturase and a reductase. A hypothetical scheme for enfumafungin assembly is proposed in which the E-ring is oxidatively cleaved to yield the four-ring system of enfumafungin. EfuA represents the first member of a widespread lineage of fungal SHCs."
Resistance-gene-directed discovery of a natural-product herbicide with a new mode of action.,29995859,"Bioactive natural products have evolved to inhibit specific cellular targets and have served as lead molecules for health and agricultural applications for the past century1-3. The post-genomics era has brought a renaissance in the discovery of natural products using synthetic-biology tools4-6. However, compared to traditional bioactivity-guided approaches, genome mining of natural products with specific and potent biological activities remains challenging4. Here we present the discovery and validation of a potent herbicide that targets a critical metabolic enzyme that is required for plant survival. Our approach is based on the co-clustering of a self-resistance gene in the natural-product biosynthesis gene cluster7-9, which provides insight into the potential biological activity of the encoded compound. We targeted dihydroxy-acid dehydratase in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway in plants; the last step in this pathway is often targeted for herbicide development10. We show that the fungal sesquiterpenoid aspterric acid, which was discovered using the method described above, is a sub-micromolar inhibitor of dihydroxy-acid dehydratase that is effective as a herbicide in spray applications. The self-resistance gene astD was validated to be insensitive to aspterric acid and was deployed as a transgene in the establishment of plants that are resistant to aspterric acid. This herbicide-resistance gene combination complements the urgent ongoing efforts to overcome weed resistance11. Our discovery demonstrates the potential of using a resistance-gene-directed approach in the discovery of bioactive natural products."
Self-resistance guided genome mining uncovers new topoisomerase inhibitors from myxobacteria.,29910943,"There is astounding discrepancy between the genome-inscribed production capacity and the set of known secondary metabolite classes from many microorganisms as detected under laboratory cultivation conditions. Genome-mining techniques are meant to fill this gap, but in order to favor discovery of structurally novel as well as bioactive compounds it is crucial to amend genomics-based strategies with selective filtering principles. In this study, we followed a self-resistance guided approach aiming at the discovery of inhibitors of topoisomerase, known as valid target in both cancer and antibiotic therapy. A common host self-defense mechanism against such inhibitors in bacteria is mediated by so-called pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRP). Genes encoding the biosynthetic machinery for production of an alleged topoisomerase inhibitor were found on the basis of their collocation adjacent to a predicted PRP in the genome of the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax An d48, but to date no matching compound has been reported from this bacterium. Activation of this peculiar polyketide synthase type-II gene cluster in the native host as well as its heterologous expression led to the structure elucidation of new natural products that were named pyxidicyclines and provided an insight into their biosynthesis. Subsequent topoisomerase inhibition assays showed strong affinity to - and inhibition of - unwinding topoisomerases such as E. coli topoisomerase IV and human topoisomerase I by pyxidicyclines as well as precise selectivity, since E. coli topoisomerase II (gyrase) was not inhibited at concentrations up to 50 μg ml-1."
Self-Resistance during Muraymycin Biosynthesis: a Complementary Nucleotidyltransferase and Phosphotransferase with Identical Modification Sites and Distinct Temporal Order.,29735559,"Muraymycins are antibacterial natural products from Streptomyces spp. that inhibit translocase I (MraY), which is involved in cell wall biosynthesis. Structurally, muraymycins consist of a 5'-C-glycyluridine (GlyU) appended to a 5″-amino-5″-deoxyribose (ADR), forming a disaccharide core that is found in several peptidyl nucleoside inhibitors of MraY. For muraymycins, the GlyU-ADR disaccharide is further modified with an aminopropyl-linked peptide to generate the simplest structures, annotated as the muraymycin D series. Two enzymes encoded in the muraymycin biosynthetic gene cluster, Mur29 and Mur28, were functionally assigned in vitro as a Mg·ATP-dependent nucleotidyltransferase and a Mg·ATP-dependent phosphotransferase, respectively, both modifying the 3″-OH of the disaccharide. Biochemical characterization revealed that both enzymes can utilize several nucleotide donors as cosubstrates and the acceptor substrate muraymycin also behaves as an inhibitor. Single-substrate kinetic analyses revealed that Mur28 preferentially phosphorylates a synthetic GlyU-ADR disaccharide, a hypothetical biosynthetic precursor of muraymycins, while Mur29 preferentially adenylates the D series of muraymycins. The adenylated or phosphorylated products have significantly reduced (170-fold and 51-fold, respectively) MraY inhibitory activities and reduced antibacterial activities, compared with the respective unmodified muraymycins. The results are consistent with Mur29-catalyzed adenylation and Mur28-catalyzed phosphorylation serving as complementary self-resistance mechanisms, with a distinct temporal order during muraymycin biosynthesis."
Specificity of Induction of Glycopeptide Antibiotic Resistance in the Producing Actinomycetes.,29693566,"Glycopeptide antibiotics are drugs of last resort for treating severe infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. It is widely believed that glycopeptide-resistance determinants (van genes) are ultimately derived from the producing actinomycetes. We hereby investigated the relationship between the antimicrobial activity of vancomycin and teicoplanins and their differential ability to induce van gene expression in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus&mdash;the producer of teicoplanin&mdash;and Nonomuraea gerenzanensis&mdash;the producer of the teicoplanin-like A40926. As a control, we used the well-characterized resistance model Streptomyces coelicolor. The enzyme activities of a cytoplasmic-soluble d,d-dipeptidase and of a membrane-associated d,d-carboxypeptidase (corresponding to VanX and VanY respectively) involved in resistant cell wall remodeling were measured in the actinomycetes grown in the presence or absence of subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and A40926. Results indicated that actinomycetes possess diverse self-resistance mechanisms, and that each of them responds differently to glycopeptide induction. Gene swapping among teicoplanins-producing actinomycetes indicated that cross-talking is possible and provides useful information for predicting the evolution of future resistance gene combinations emerging in pathogens."
Genomics-driven discovery of a novel self-resistance mechanism in the echinocandin-producing fungus Pezicula radicicola.,29528534,"The echinocandins are antifungal lipopeptides targeting fungi via noncompetitive inhibition of the β-1,3-d-glucan synthase FKS1 subunit. A novel echinocandin resistance mechanism involving an auxiliary copy of FKS1 in echinocandin-producing fungus Pezicula radicicola NRRL 12192 was discovered. We sequenced the genome of NRRL 12192 and predicted two FKS1-encoding genes (prfks1n and prfks1a), rather than a single FKS1 gene typical of filamentous ascomycetes. The prfks1a gene sits immediately adjacent to an echinocandin (sporiofungin) gene cluster, which was confirmed by disruption of prnrps4 and abolishment of sporiofungin production. Disruption of prfks1a dramatically increased the strain's sensitivity to exogenous echinocandins. In the absence of echinocandins, transcription levels of prfks1a relative to β-tubulin in the wild type and in Δprnrps4 stains were similar. Moreover, prfks1a is consistently transcribed at low levels and is upregulated in the presence of exogenous echinocandin, but not during growth conditions promoting endogenous production of sporiofungin. Therefore, we conclude that prfks1a is primarily responsible for protecting the fungus against extracellular echinocandin toxicity. The presence of unclustered auxiliary copies of FKS1 with high similarity to prfks1a in two other echinocandin-producing strains suggests that this previously unrecognized resistance mechanism may be common in echinocandin-producing fungi of the family Dermataceae of the class Leotiomycetes."
Expression of Genes Involved in Bacteriocin Production and Self-Resistance in Lactobacillus brevis 174A Is Mediated by Two Regulatory Proteins.,29352085,"We have previously shown that the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus brevis 174A, isolated from Citrus iyo fruit, produces a bacteriocin designated brevicin 174A, which is comprised of two antibacterial polypeptides (designated brevicins 174A-β and 174A-γ). We have also found a gene cluster, composed of eight open reading frames (ORFs), that contains genes for the biosynthesis of brevicin 174A, self-resistance to its own bacteriocin, and two transcriptional regulatory proteins. Some lactic acid bacterial strains have a system to start the production of bacteriocin at an adequate stage of growth. Generally, the system consists of a membrane-bound histidine protein kinase (HPK) that senses a specific environmental stimulus and a corresponding response regulator (RR) that mediates the cellular response. We have previously shown that although the HPK- and RR-encoding genes are not found on the brevicin 174A biosynthetic gene cluster in the 174A strain, two putative regulatory genes, designated breD and breG, are in the gene cluster. In the present study, we demonstrate that the expression of brevicin 174A production and self-resistance is positively controlled by two transcriptional regulatory proteins, designated BreD and BreG. BreD is expressed together with BreE as the self-resistance determinant of L. brevis 174A. DNase I footprinting analysis and a promoter assay demonstrated that BreD binds to the breED promoter as a positive autoregulator. The present study also demonstrates that BreG, carrying a transmembrane domain, binds to the common promoter of breB and breC, encoding brevicins 174A-β and 174A-γ, respectively, for positive regulation.IMPORTANCE The problem of the appearance of bacteria that are resistant to practical antibiotics and the increasing demand for safe foods have increased interest in replacing conventional antibiotics with bacteriocin produced by the lactic acid bacteria. This antibacterial substance can inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria without side effects on the human body. The bacteriocin that is produced by a Citrus iyo-derived Lactobacillus brevis strain inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans In general, lactic acid bacterial strains have a system to start the production of bacteriocin at an adequate stage of growth, which is called a quorum-sensing system. The system consists of a membrane-bound histidine protein kinase that senses a specific environmental stimulus and a corresponding response regulator that mediates the cellular response. The present study demonstrates that the expression of the genes encoding bacteriocin biosynthesis and the self-resistance determinant is positively controlled by two transcriptional regulatory proteins."
Improvement of oxytetracycline production mediated via cooperation of resistance genes in Streptomyces rimosus.,28755296,"Increasing the self-resistance levels of Streptomyces is an effective strategy to improve the production of antibiotics. To increase the oxytetracycline (OTC) production in Streptomyces rimosus, we investigated the cooperative effect of three co-overexpressing OTC resistance genes: one gene encodes a ribosomal protection protein (otrA) and the other two express efflux proteins (otrB and otrC). Results indicated that combinational overexpression of otrA, otrB, and otrC (MKABC) exerted a synergetic effect. OTC production increased by 179% in the recombinant strain compared with that of the wild-type strain M4018. The resistance level to OTC was increased by approximately two-fold relative to the parental strain, thereby indicating that applying the cooperative effect of self-resistance genes is useful to improve OTC production. Furthermore, the previously identified cluster-situated activator OtcR was overexpressed in MKABC in constructing the recombinant strain MKRABC; such strain can produce OTC of approximately 7.49 g L-1, which represents an increase of 19% in comparison with that of the OtcR-overexpressing strain alone. Our work showed that the cooperative overexpression of self-resistance genes is a promising strategy to enhance the antibiotics production in Streptomyces."
"DnrI of Streptomyces peucetius binds to the resistance genes, drrAB and drrC but is activated by daunorubicin.",28745822,"The master regulator, DnrI of Streptomyces peucetius is a member of the family of transcriptional activator, Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins (SARP), which controls the biosynthesis of antitumor anthracycline, daunorubicin (DNR) and doxorubicin (DXR). The binding of DnrI to the heptameric repeat sequence found within the -35 promoter region of biosynthetic gene, dpsE activates it. To combat the increased level of intracellular DNR, the cell has developed self resistance mechanism mediated by drrAB and drrC genes which are regulated by regulatory genes. We find that a drug non-producing mutant, ΔdpsA, showed sensitive phenotype in plate assay along with an increased level of dnrI transcript. Whereas the mutant grown in the presence of DNR showed a resistant phenotype with a six and eight folds increase in drrAB and drrC transcripts respectively. Computational studies followed by molecular docking showed that DnrI bound as a monomer to a slightly modified heptameric DNA motif, 5'-ACACGCA in drrA and 5'-ACAACCT in drrC which was also proved by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These findings confirm that DnrI belongs to winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding protein with Tetratricopeptide Repeat domain. The transcriptional regulator DnrI binds to the resistance genes at specific sites but they are activated only when an increased load of intracellular DNR is sensed."
Identification and Characterization of the Sulfazecin Monobactam Biosynthetic Gene Cluster.,28017601,"The monobactams, exemplified by the natural product sulfazecin, are the only class of β-lactam antibiotics not inactivated by metallo-β-lactamases, which confer bacteria with extended-spectrum β-lactam resistance. We screened a transposon mutagenesis library from Pseudomonas acidophila ATCC 31363 and isolated a sulfazecin-deficient mutant that revealed a gene cluster encoding two non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), a methyltransferase, a sulfotransferase, and a dioxygenase. Three modules and an aberrant C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain are distributed across the two NRPSs. Biochemical examination of the adenylation (A) domains provided evidence that L-2,3-diaminopropionate, not L-serine as previously thought, is the direct source of the β-lactam ring of sulfazecin. ATP/PPi exchange assay also revealed an unusual substrate selectivity shift of one A domain when expressed with or without the immediately upstream condensation domain. Gene inactivation analysis defined a cluster of 13 open reading frames sufficient for sulfazecin production, precursor synthesis, self-resistance, and regulation. The identification of a key intermediate supported a proposed NRPS-mediated mechanism of sulfazecin biosynthesis and β-lactam ring formation distinct from the nocardicins, another NRPS-derived subclass of monocyclic β-lactam. These findings will serve as the basis for further biosynthetic research and potential engineering of these important antibiotics."
Multiple transporters are involved in natamycin efflux in Streptomyces chattanoogensis L10.,27874224,"Antibiotic-producing microorganisms have evolved several self-resistance mechanisms to prevent auto-toxicity. Overexpression of specific transporters to improve the efflux of toxic antibiotics has been found one of the most important and intrinsic resistance strategies used by many Streptomyces strains. In this work, two ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-encoding genes located in the natamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, scnA and scnB, were identified as the primary exporter genes for natamycin efflux in Streptomyces chattanoogensis L10. Two other transporters located outside the cluster, a major facilitator superfamily transporter Mfs1 and an ABC transporter NepI/II were found to play a complementary role in natamycin efflux. ScnA/ScnB and Mfs1 also participate in exporting the immediate precursor of natamycin, 4,5-de-epoxynatamycin, which is more toxic to S. chattanoogensis L10 than natamycin. As the major complementary exporter for natamycin efflux, Mfs1 is up-regulated in response to intracellular accumulation of natamycin and 4,5-de-epoxynatamycin, suggesting a key role in the stress response for self-resistance. This article discusses a novel antibiotic-related efflux and response system in Streptomyces, as well as a self-resistance mechanism in antibiotic-producing strains."
Strategies for the Discovery and Development of New Antibiotics from Natural Products: Three Case Studies.,27738913,"Natural products continue to be a predominant source for new anti-infective agents. Research at the Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland (HIPS) and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) is dedicated to the development of new lead structures against infectious diseases and, in particular, new antibiotics against hard-to-treat and multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens. In this chapter, we introduce some of the concepts currently being employed in the field of antibiotic discovery. In particular, we will exemplarily illustrate three approaches: (1) Current sources for novel compounds are mainly soil-dwelling bacteria. In the course of our antimicrobial discovery program, a biodiverse collection of myxobacterial strains has been established and screened for antibiotic activities. Based on this effort, one successful example is presented in this chapter: Antibacterial cystobactamids were discovered and their molecular target, the DNA gyrase, was identified soon after the analysis of myxobacterial self-resistance making use of the information found in the respective biosynthesis gene cluster. (2) Besides our focus on novel natural products, we also apply strategies to further develop either neglected drugs or widely used antibiotics for which development of resistance in the clinical setting is an issue: Antimycobacterial griselimycins were first described in the 1960s but their development and use in tuberculosis therapy was not further pursued. We show how a griselimycin derivative with improved pharmacokinetic properties and enhanced potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed and validated a novel target for antibacterial therapy, the DNA sliding clamp. (3) In a third approach, biosynthetic engineering was used to modify and optimize natural products regarding their pharmaceutical properties and their production scale: The atypical tetracycline chelocardin is a natural product scaffold that was modified to yield a more potent derivative exhibiting activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens. This was achieved by genetic engineering of the producer strain and the resulting compound is now subject to further optimization by medicinal chemistry approaches."
Partial Diversity Generates Effector Immunity Specificity of the Bac41-Like Bacteriocins of Enterococcus faecalis Clinical Strains.,27353651,"Bacteriocin 41 (Bac41) is the plasmid-encoded bacteriocin produced by the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis Its genetic determinant consists of bacL1 (effector), bacL2 (regulator), bacA (effector), and bacI (immunity). The secreted effectors BacL1 and BacA coordinate to induce the lytic cell death of E. faecalis Meanwhile, the immunity factor BacI provides self-resistance to the Bac41 producer, E. faecalis, against the action of BacL1 and BacA. In this study, we demonstrated that more than half of the 327 clinical strains of E. faecalis screened had functional Bac41 genes. Analysis of the genetic structure of the Bac41 genes in the DNA sequences of the E. faecalis strains revealed that the Bac41-like genes consist of a relatively conserved region and a variable region located downstream from bacA Based on similarities in the variable region, the Bac41-like genes could be classified into type I, type IIa, and type IIb. Interestingly, the distinct Bac41 types had specific immunity factors for self-resistance, BacI1 or BacI2, and did not show cross-immunity to the other type of effector. We also demonstrated experimentally that the specificity of the immunity was determined by the combination of the C-terminal region of BacA and the presence of the unique BacI1 or BacI2 factor. These observations suggested that Bac41-like bacteriocin genes are extensively disseminated among E. faecalis strains in the clinical environment and can be grouped into at least three types. It was also indicated that the partial diversity results in specificity of self-resistance which may offer these strains a competitive advantage."
The Pseudomonas aeruginosa efflux pump MexGHI-OpmD transports a natural phenazine that controls gene expression and biofilm development.,27274079,"Redox-cycling compounds, including endogenously produced phenazine antibiotics, induce expression of the efflux pump MexGHI-OpmD in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa Previous studies of P. aeruginosa virulence, physiology, and biofilm development have focused on the blue phenazine pyocyanin and the yellow phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). In P. aeruginosa phenazine biosynthesis, conversion of PCA to pyocyanin is presumed to proceed through the intermediate 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylate (5-Me-PCA), a reactive compound that has eluded detection in most laboratory samples. Here, we apply electrochemical methods to directly detect 5-Me-PCA and find that it is transported by MexGHI-OpmD in P. aeruginosa strain PA14 planktonic and biofilm cells. We also show that 5-Me-PCA is sufficient to fully induce MexGHI-OpmD expression and that it is required for wild-type colony biofilm morphogenesis. These physiological effects are consistent with the high redox potential of 5-Me-PCA, which distinguishes it from other well-studied P. aeruginosa phenazines. Our observations highlight the importance of this compound, which was previously overlooked due to the challenges associated with its detection, in the context of P. aeruginosa gene expression and multicellular behavior. This study constitutes a unique demonstration of efflux-based self-resistance, controlled by a simple circuit, in a Gram-negative pathogen."
Elucidating the molecular physiology of lantibiotic NAI-107 production in Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024.,26754974,"The filamentous actinomycete Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 produces the lantibiotic NAI-107, which is an antibiotic peptide effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. In actinomycetes, antibiotic production is often associated with a physiological differentiation program controlled by a complex regulatory and metabolic network that may be elucidated by the integration of genomic, proteomic and bioinformatic tools. Accordingly, an extensive evaluation of the proteomic changes associated with NAI-107 production was performed on Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 by combining two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and gene ontology approaches."
Identification and Functional Analysis of the Mycophenolic Acid Gene Cluster of Penicillium roqueforti.,26751579,"The filamentous fungus Penicillium roqueforti is widely known as the ripening agent of blue-veined cheeses. Additionally, this fungus is able to produce several secondary metabolites, including the meroterpenoid compound mycophenolic acid (MPA). Cheeses ripened with P. roqueforti are usually contaminated with MPA. On the other hand, MPA is a commercially valuable immunosuppressant. However, to date the molecular basis of the production of MPA by P. roqueforti is still unknown. Using a bioinformatic approach, we have identified a genomic region of approximately 24.4 kbp containing a seven-gene cluster that may be involved in the MPA biosynthesis in P. roqueforti. Gene silencing of each of these seven genes (named mpaA, mpaB, mpaC, mpaDE, mpaF, mpaG and mpaH) resulted in dramatic reductions in MPA production, confirming that all of these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the compound. Interestingly, the mpaF gene, originally described in P. brevicompactum as a MPA self-resistance gene, also exerts the same function in P. roqueforti, suggesting that this gene has a dual function in MPA metabolism. The knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway of MPA in P. roqueforti will be important for the future control of MPA contamination in cheeses and the improvement of MPA production for commercial purposes."
A genomics-led approach to deciphering the mechanism of thiotetronate antibiotic biosynthesis.,28791099,"Thiolactomycin (TLM) is a thiotetronate antibiotic that selectively targets bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis through inhibition of the β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthases (KASI/II) that catalyse chain elongation on the type II (dissociated) fatty acid synthase. It has proved effective in in vivo infection models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and continues to attract interest as a template for drug discovery. We have used a comparative genomics approach to uncover the (hitherto elusive) biosynthetic pathway to TLM and related thiotetronates. Analysis of the whole-genome sequence of Streptomyces olivaceus Tü 3010 producing the more ramified thiotetronate Tü 3010 provided initial evidence that such thiotetronates are assembled by a novel iterative polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase, and revealed the identity of other pathway enzymes, encoded by adjacent genes. Subsequent genome sequencing of three other thiotetronate-producing actinomycetes, including the Lentzea sp. ATCC 31319 that produces TLM, confirmed that near-identical clusters were also present in these genomes. In-frame gene deletion within the cluster for Tü 3010 from Streptomyces thiolactonus NRRL 15439, or within the TLM cluster, led to loss of production of the respective thiotetronate, confirming their identity. Each cluster houses at least one gene encoding a KASI/II enzyme, suggesting plausible mechanisms for self-resistance. A separate genetic locus encodes a cysteine desulfurase and a (thiouridylase-like) sulfur transferase to supply the sulfur atom for thiotetronate ring formation. Transfer of the main Tü 3010 gene cluster (stu gene cluster) into Streptomyces avermitilis led to heterologous production of this thiotetronate, showing that an equivalent sulfur donor can be supplied by this host strain. Mutational analysis of the Tü 3010 and TLM clusters has revealed the unexpected role of a cytochrome P450 enzyme in thiotetronate ring formation. These insights have allowed us to propose a mechanism for sulfur insertion, and have opened the way to engineering of the biosynthesis of TLM and other thiotetronates to produce novel analogues."
"Crystal Structure of the Zorbamycin-Binding Protein ZbmA, the Primary Self-Resistance Element in Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC21892.",26512730,"The bleomycins (BLMs), tallysomycins (TLMs), phleomycin, and zorbamycin (ZBM) are members of the BLM family of glycopeptide-derived antitumor antibiotics. The BLM-producing Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 and the TLM-producing Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC31158 both possess at least two self-resistance elements, an N-acetyltransferase and a binding protein. The N-acetyltransferase provides resistance by disrupting the metal-binding domain of the antibiotic that is required for activity, while the binding protein confers resistance by sequestering the metal-bound antibiotic and preventing drug activation via molecular oxygen. We recently established that the ZBM producer, Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC21892, lacks the N-acetyltransferase resistance gene and that the ZBM-binding protein, ZbmA, is sufficient to confer resistance in the producing strain. To investigate the resistance mechanism attributed to ZbmA, we determined the crystal structures of apo and Cu(II)-ZBM-bound ZbmA at high resolutions of 1.90 and 1.65 Å, respectively. A comparison and contrast with other structurally characterized members of the BLM-binding protein family revealed key differences in the protein-ligand binding environment that fine-tunes the ability of ZbmA to sequester metal-bound ZBM and supports drug sequestration as the primary resistance mechanism in the producing organisms of the BLM family of antitumor antibiotics."
"Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for maklamicin, a spirotetronate-class antibiotic of the endophytic Micromonospora sp. NBRC 110955.",26505309,"Maklamicin, which is produced by the endophytic Micromonospora sp. NBRC 110955, is a spirotetronate-class antibiotic possessing anti-microbial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and has several unique structural features different from other spirotetronates. Here we describe identification and characterization of the maklamicin biosynthetic (mak) gene cluster through draft genome sequencing, genomic library screening, and gene disruption. Sequence analysis revealed that a plausible maklamicin cluster resides in a 152 kb DNA region encoding 46 open reading frames, 24 of which can be assigned roles in the biosynthesis of polyketide backbone, spirotetronate or peripheral moieties, self-resistance and the regulation of maklamicin production. Disruption of the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes makA1 or makA4 resulted in a complete loss of maklamicin production, indicating that the type I modular PKS system is responsible for the biosynthesis of maklamicin. The mak gene cluster contained a set of biosynthetic genes for the formation of a tetronate moiety, which were found to be highly conserved in the gene clusters for spirotetronate antibiotics. Based on the estimated biosynthetic genes, we propose the biosynthetic pathway for maklamicin. Our findings provide not only insights on the biosynthetic mechanism of the unique structures in maklamicin, but also useful information to facilitate a comparative analysis of the spirotetronate biosynthetic pathways to expand the structural repertoire."
Heterologous expression of MlcE in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides resistance to natural and semi-synthetic statins.,34150514,"Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Their extensive use in treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases placed statins among the best selling drugs. Construction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell factory for the production of high concentrations of natural statins will require establishment of a non-destructive self-resistance mechanism to overcome the undesirable growth inhibition effects of statins. To establish active export of statins from yeast, and thereby detoxification, we integrated a putative efflux pump-encoding gene mlcE from the mevastatin-producing Penicillium citrinum into the S. cerevisiae genome. The resulting strain showed increased resistance to both natural statins (mevastatin and lovastatin) and semi-synthetic statin (simvastatin) when compared to the wild type strain. Expression of RFP-tagged mlcE showed that MlcE is localized to the yeast plasma and vacuolar membranes. We provide a possible engineering strategy for improvement of future yeast based production of natural and semi-synthetic statins."
Ornithine Transcarbamylase ArgK Plays a Dual role for the Self-defense of Phaseolotoxin Producing Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola.,26256666,"Pseudomonas syringae is a phytopathogenic bacterium widely spread on terrestrial plants. Sulfodiaminophosphinyl tripeptide Phaseolotoxins (PHTs), produced by P. syringae pv. phaseolicola and P. syringae pv. actinidiae, represent a kind of antimetabolic phytotoxins. PHTs inhibit host cell Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTCase) activity and induce Arginine auxotrophic phenotype. The biosynthesis of PHT is temperature dependent, being optically produced at around 18 °C, while blocked above 28 °C. PHT resistant OTCase ArgK acts as a functional replacement of housekeeping OTCase ArgF, which is the acting target of PHT, to confer PHT producers with self-resistance. It was postulated that argK might be regulated directly by a PHT biosynthetic precursor and indirectly by temperature with an unknown manner. Neither transcriptional regulator nor thermal regulation related protein encoding gene was detected from PHT biosynthetic gene cluster. The tripeptide, Cit-Ala-hArg, was identified to be a by-product of PHT biosynthetic pathway in this report. Formation of Cit-Ala-hArg was catalyzed by ArgK with tripeptide Orn-Ala-hArg and carbamyl phosphate as substrates. It showed that ArgK not only provided alternative Arginine source as reported previously, but also controlled the production of PHTs by converting PHT biosynthetic precursors to nontoxic Cit-Ala-hArg reservoir for producers' self-defense."
Alternative Pathway to a Glycopeptide-Resistant Cell Wall in the Balhimycin Producer Amycolatopsis balhimycina.,27622740,"Balhimycin, a vancomycin-type glycopeptide, is a lipid II targeting antibiotic produced by Amycolatopsis balhimycina. A. balhimycina has developed a self-resistance mechanism based on the synergistic action of different enzymes resulting in modified peptidoglycan. The canonical resistance mechanism against glycopeptides is the synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors ending with acyl-d-alanyl-d-lactate (d-Ala-d-Lac) rather than acyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala). This reprogramming is the result of the enzymes VanH, VanA, and VanX. VanH and VanA are required to produce d-Ala-d-Lac; VanX cleaves cytosolic pools of d-Ala-d-Ala, thereby ensuring that peptidoglycan is enriched in d-Ala-d-Lac. In A. balhimycina, the ΔvanHAXAb mutant showed a reduced glycopeptide resistance in comparison to the wild type. Nevertheless, ΔvanHAXAb was paradoxically still able to produce d-Ala-d-Lac containing resistant cell wall precursors suggesting the presence of a novel alternative glycopeptide resistance mechanism. In silico analysis, inactivation studies, and biochemical assays led to the characterization of an enzyme, Ddl1Ab, as a paraloguous chromosomal d-Ala-d-Lac ligase able to complement the function of VanAAb in the ΔvanHAXAb mutant. Furthermore, A. balhimycina harbors a vanYAb gene encoding a d,d-carboxypeptidase. Transcriptional analysis revealed an upregulated expression of vanYAb in the ΔvanHAXAb mutant. VanYAb cleaves the endstanding d-Ala from the pentapeptide precursors, reducing the quantity of sensitive cell wall precursors in the absence of VanXAb. These findings represent an unprecedented coordinated layer of resistance mechanisms in a glycopeptide antibiotic producing bacterium."
Distinct mechanisms contribute to immunity in the lantibiotic NAI-107 producer strain Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024.,25923468,"The investigation of self-resistance in antibiotic producers is important to understand the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens and to improve antibiotic production. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antibiotics that mostly target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The actinomycete Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 produces the lantibiotic NAI-107, which interferes with peptidoglycan biosynthesis by binding bactoprenol-pyrophosphate-coupled peptidoglycan precursors. In order to understand how Microbispora counteracts the action of its own antibiotic, its peptidoglycan composition was analysed in detail. Microbispora peptidoglycan consists of muropeptides with D-Ala and Gly in similar proportion at the fourth position of the peptide stems and alternative 3-3 cross-links besides the classical 4-3 cross-links. In addition, the NAI-107 biosynthetic gene cluster (mlb) was analysed for the expression of immunity proteins. We show that distinct immunity determinants are encoded in the mlb cluster: the ABC transporter MlbYZ acting cooperatively with the transmembrane protein MlbJ and the lipoprotein MlbQ. NMR structural analysis of MlbQ revealed a hydrophobic surface patch, which is proposed to bind the cognate lantibiotic. This study demonstrates that immunity in Microbispora is not only based on one determinant but on the action of the distinct immunity proteins MlbQ, MlbYZ and MlbJ."
Membrane transporters in self resistance of Cercospora nicotianae to the photoactivated toxin cercosporin.,25862648,"The goal of this work is to characterize membrane transporter genes in Cercospora fungi required for autoresistance to the photoactivated, active-oxygen-generating toxin cercosporin they produce for infection of host plants. Previous studies implicated a role for diverse membrane transporters in cercosporin resistance. In this study, transporters identified in a subtractive cDNA library between a Cercospora nicotianae wild type and a cercosporin-sensitive mutant were characterized, including two ABC transporters (CnATR2, CnATR3), an MFS transporter (CnMFS2), a uracil transporter, and a zinc transport protein. Phylogenetic analysis showed that only CnATR3 clustered with transporters previously characterized to be involved in cercosporin resistance. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expression under conditions of cercosporin toxicity, however, showed that only CnATR2 was upregulated, thus this gene was selected for further characterization. Transformation and expression of CnATR2 in the cercosporin-sensitive fungus Neurospora crassa significantly increased cercosporin resistance. Targeted gene disruption of CnATR2 in the wild type C. nicotianae, however, did not decrease resistance. Expression analysis of other transporters in the cnatr2 mutant under conditions of cercosporin toxicity showed significant upregulation of the cercosporin facilitator protein gene (CFP), encoding an MFS transporter previously characterized as playing an important role in cercosporin autoresistance in Cercospora species. We conclude that cercosporin autoresistance in Cercospora is mediated by multiple genes, and that the fungus compensates for mutations by up-regulation of other resistance genes. CnATR2 may be a useful gene, alone or in addition to other known resistance genes, for engineering Cercospora resistance in crop plants."
"The Biosynthesis of Capuramycin-type Antibiotics: IDENTIFICATION OF THE A-102395 BIOSYNTHETIC GENE CLUSTER, MECHANISM OF SELF-RESISTANCE, AND FORMATION OF URIDINE-5'-CARBOXAMIDE.",25855790,"A-500359s, A-503083s, and A-102395 are capuramycin-type nucleoside antibiotics that were discovered using a screen to identify inhibitors of bacterial translocase I, an essential enzyme in peptidoglycan cell wall biosynthesis. Like the parent capuramycin, A-500359s and A-503083s consist of three structural components: a uridine-5'-carboxamide (CarU), a rare unsaturated hexuronic acid, and an aminocaprolactam, the last of which is substituted by an unusual arylamine-containing polyamide in A-102395. The biosynthetic gene clusters for A-500359s and A-503083s have been reported, and two genes encoding a putative non-heme Fe(II)-dependent α-ketoglutarate:UMP dioxygenase and an l-Thr:uridine-5'-aldehyde transaldolase were uncovered, suggesting that C-C bond formation during assembly of the high carbon (C6) sugar backbone of CarU proceeds from the precursors UMP and l-Thr to form 5'-C-glycyluridine (C7) as a biosynthetic intermediate. Here, isotopic enrichment studies with the producer of A-503083s were used to indeed establish l-Thr as the direct source of the carboxamide of CarU. With this knowledge, the A-102395 gene cluster was subsequently cloned and characterized. A genetic system in the A-102395-producing strain was developed, permitting the inactivation of several genes, including those encoding the dioxygenase (cpr19) and transaldolase (cpr25), which abolished the production of A-102395, thus confirming their role in biosynthesis. Heterologous production of recombinant Cpr19 and CapK, the transaldolase homolog involved in A-503083 biosynthesis, confirmed their expected function. Finally, a phosphotransferase (Cpr17) conferring self-resistance was functionally characterized. The results provide the opportunity to use comparative genomics along with in vivo and in vitro approaches to probe the biosynthetic mechanism of these intriguing structures."
Cystobactamids: myxobacterial topoisomerase inhibitors exhibiting potent antibacterial activity.,25510965,"The development of new antibiotics faces a severe crisis inter alia owing to a lack of innovative chemical scaffolds with activities against Gram-negative and multiresistant pathogens. Herein, we report highly potent novel antibacterial compounds, the myxobacteria-derived cystobactamids 1-3, which were isolated from Cystobacter sp. and show minimum inhibitory concentrations in the low μg mL(-1) range. We describe the isolation and structure elucidation of three congeners as well as the identification and annotation of their biosynthetic gene cluster. By studying the self-resistance mechanism in the natural producer organism, the molecular targets were identified as bacterial type IIa topoisomerases. As quinolones are largely exhausted as a template for new type II topoisomerase inhibitors, the cystobactamids offer exciting alternatives to generate novel antibiotics using medicinal chemistry and biosynthetic engineering."
Penicillin-binding proteins in Actinobacteria.,25351947,"Because some Actinobacteria, especially Streptomyces species, are β-lactam-producing bacteria, they have to have some self-resistant mechanism. The β-lactam biosynthetic gene clusters include genes for β-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), suggesting that these are involved in self-resistance. However, direct evidence for the involvement of β-lactamases does not exist at the present time. Instead, phylogenetic analysis revealed that PBPs in Streptomyces are distinct in that Streptomyces species have much more PBPs than other Actinobacteria, and that two to three pairs of similar PBPs are present in most Streptomyces species examined. Some of these PBPs bind benzylpenicillin with very low affinity and are highly similar in their amino-acid sequences. Furthermore, other low-affinity PBPs such as SCLAV_4179 in Streptomyces clavuligerus, a β-lactam-producing Actinobacterium, may strengthen further the self-resistance against β-lactams. This review discusses the role of PBPs in resistance to benzylpenicillin in Streptomyces belonging to Actinobacteria."
"Structure-guided functional characterization of enediyne self-sacrifice resistance proteins, CalU16 and CalU19.",25079510,"Calicheamicin γ1I (1) is an enediyne antitumor compound produced by Micromonospora echinospora spp. calichensis, and its biosynthetic gene cluster has been previously reported. Despite extensive analysis and biochemical study, several genes in the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 remain functionally unassigned. Using a structural genomics approach and biochemical characterization, two proteins encoded by genes from the 1 biosynthetic gene cluster assigned as ""unknowns"", CalU16 and CalU19, were characterized. Structure analysis revealed that they possess the STeroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein related lipid Transfer (START) domain known mainly to bind and transport lipids and previously identified as the structural signature of the enediyne self-resistance protein CalC. Subsequent study revealed calU16 and calU19 to confer resistance to 1, and reminiscent of the prototype CalC, both CalU16 and CalU19 were cleaved by 1 in vitro. Through site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry, we identified the site of cleavage in each protein and characterized their function in conferring resistance against 1. This report emphasizes the importance of structural genomics as a powerful tool for the functional annotation of unknown proteins."
Genetic approaches to generate hyper-producing strains of goadsporin: the relationships between productivity and gene duplication in secondary metabolite biosynthesis.,25036825,"Improving the productivity of secondary metabolites is highly beneficial for the utilization of natural products. Here, we found that gene duplication of the goadsporin biosynthetic gene locus resulted in hyper-production. Goadsporin is a linear azole containing peptide that is biosynthesized via a ribosome-mediated pathway in Streptomyces sp. TP-A0584. Recombinant strains containing duplicated or triplicated goadsporin biosynthetic gene clusters produced 1.46- and 2.25-fold more goadsporin than the wild-type strain. In a surrogate host, Streptomyces lividans, chromosomal integration of one or two copies of the gene cluster led to 342.7 and 593.5 mg/L of goadsporin production. Expression of godI, a self-resistance gene, and of godR, a pathway-specific transcriptional regulator, under a constitutive promoter gave 0.79- and 2.12-fold higher goadsporin production than the wild-type strain. Our experiments indicated that a proportional relationship exists between goadsporin production per culture volume and the copy number of the biosynthetic gene cluster."
Relationship between glycopeptide production and resistance in the actinomycete Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727.,24957828,"Glycopeptides and β-lactams inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria; resistance to these antibiotics is studied intensively in enterococci and staphylococci because of their relevance to infectious disease. Much less is known about antibiotic resistance in glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes that are likely to represent the evolutionary source of resistance determinants found in bacterial pathogens. Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727, the producer of A40926 (the precursor for the semisynthetic dalbavancin), does not harbor the canonical vanHAX genes. Consequently, we investigated the role of the β-lactam-sensitive D,D-peptidase/D,D-carboxypeptidase encoded by vanYn, the only van-like gene found in the A40926 biosynthetic gene cluster, in conferring immunity to the antibiotic in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727. Taking advantage of the tools developed recently to genetically manipulate this uncommon actinomycete, we varied vanYn gene dosage and expressed vanHatAatXat from the teicoplanin producer Actinoplanes teichomyceticus in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727. Knocking out vanYn, complementing a vanYn mutant, or duplicating vanYn had no effect on growth but influenced antibiotic resistance and, in the cases of complementation and duplication, antibiotic production. Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 was found to be resistant to penicillins, but its glycopeptide resistance was diminished in the presence of penicillin G, which inhibits VanYn activity. The heterologous expression of vanHatAatXat increased A40926 resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 but did not increase antibiotic production, indicating that the level of antibiotic production is not directly determined by the level of resistance. The vanYn-based self-resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 resembles the glycopeptide resistance mechanism described recently in mutants of Enterococcus faecium selected in vitro for high-level resistance to glycopeptides and penicillins."
Mechanisms of self-resistance in the platensimycin- and platencin-producing Streptomyces platensis MA7327 and MA7339 strains.,24560608,"Platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN) are potent inhibitors of bacterial fatty acid synthases and have emerged as promising antibacterial drug leads. We previously characterized the PTM and PTN biosynthetic machineries in the Streptomyces platensis producers. We now identify two mechanisms for PTM and PTN resistance in the S. platensis producers-the ptmP3 or ptnP3 gene within the PTM-PTN or PTN biosynthetic cluster and the fabF gene within the fatty acid synthase locus. PtmP3/PtnP3 and FabF confer PTM and PTN resistance by target replacement and target modification, respectively. PtmP3/PtnP3 also represents an unprecedented mechanism for fatty acid biosynthesis in which FabH and FabF are functionally replaced by a single condensing enzyme. These findings challenge the current paradigm for fatty acid biosynthesis and should be considered in future development of effective therapeutics targeting fatty acid synthase."
"Dithiolopyrrolone natural products: isolation, synthesis and biosynthesis.",24141227,"Dithiolopyrrolones are a class of antibiotics that possess the unique pyrrolinonodithiole (4H-[1,2] dithiolo [4,3-b] pyrrol-5-one) skeleton linked to two variable acyl groups. To date, there are approximately 30 naturally occurring dithiolopyrrolone compounds, including holomycin, thiolutin, and aureothricin, and more recently thiomarinols, a unique class of hybrid marine bacterial natural products containing a dithiolopyrrolone framework linked by an amide bridge with an 8-hydroxyoctanoyl chain linked to a monic acid. Generally, dithiolopyrrolone antibiotics have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against various microorganisms, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and even parasites. Holomycin appeared to be active against rifamycin-resistant bacteria and also inhibit the growth of the clinical pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus N315. Its mode of action is believed to inhibit RNA synthesis although the exact mechanism has yet to be established in vitro. A recent work demonstrated that the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri employs an RNA methyltransferase for self-resistance during the holomycin production. Moreover, some dithiolopyrrolone derivatives have demonstrated promising antitumor activities. The biosynthetic gene clusters of holomycin have recently been identified in S. clavuligerus and characterized biochemically and genetically. The biosynthetic gene cluster of thiomarinol was also identified from the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SANK 73390, which was uniquely encoded by two independent pathways for pseudomonic acid and pyrrothine in a novel plasmid. The aim of this review is to give an overview about the isolations, characterizations, synthesis, biosynthesis, bioactivities and mode of action of this unique family of dithiolopyrrolone natural products, focusing on the period from 1940s until now."
Rhizobacterium-mediated growth promotion and expression of stress enzymes in Glycine max L. Merrill against Fusarium wilt upon challenge inoculation.,23933805,"Wilt disease of soybean caused by a very common soil-borne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop. The aim of the present study was to characterize plant growth-promotion activities and induced resistance of a rhizobacterial strain for the soybean plant against F. oxysporum. Rhizobacterium strain SJ-5 exhibited plant growth-promotion characteristics and antagonistic activity against the test pathogen on dual plate assay. It was identified as a Carnobacterium sp. A 950 bp PCR product was amplified from Carnobacterium sp. strain SJ-5, using zwittermicin A self-resistance gene-specific primers (zmaR). The strain produced indole 3-acetic acid (19 μg/ml) in the presence of salt stress and exhibited growth in Dworkin and Foster salt medium amended with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) through ACC deaminase activity (277 nmol/mg/h) as compared to the control. Strain seeds treated with the strain significantly enhanced the quorum of healthy plants after challenge inoculation at 14 days after seeding. An increase in the activity of stress enzymes after challenge inoculation with the test pathogen is reported. Treatment with the bacterium resulted in an increase in the chlorophyll content in the leaves in comparison with challenge-inoculated plants."
The fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri produces holomycin and uses an RNA methyltransferase for self-resistance.,23572522,"Holomycin and its derivatives belong to a class of broad-spectrum antibacterial natural products containing a rare dithiolopyrrolone heterobicyclic scaffold. The antibacterial mechanism of dithiolopyrrolone compounds has been attributed to the inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase activities, although the exact mode of action has not been established in vitro. Some dithiopyrrolone derivatives display potent anticancer activities. Recently the biosynthetic gene cluster of holomycin has been identified and characterized in Streptomyces clavuligerus. Here we report that the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri is a holomycin producer, as evidenced through genome mining, chemical isolation, and structural elucidation as well as genetic manipulation. We also identified a unique regulatory gene hom15 at one end of the gene cluster encoding a cold-shock-like protein that likely regulates the production of holomycin in low cultivation temperatures. Inactivation of hom15 resulted in a significant loss of holomycin production. Finally, gene disruption of an RNA methyltransferase gene hom12 resulted in the sensitivity of the mutant toward holomycin. A complementation experiment of hom12 restored the resistance against holomycin. Although the wild-type Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Gold is susceptible to holomycin, the mutant harboring hom12 showed tolerance toward holomycin. High resolution liquid chromatography (LC)-ESI/MS analysis of digested RNA fragments demonstrated that the wild-type Y. ruckeri and E. coli harboring hom12 contain a methylated RNA fragment, whereas the mutated Y. ruckeri and the wild-type E. coli only contain normal non-methylated RNA fragments. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that this putative RNA methyltransferase Hom12 is the self-resistance protein that methylates the RNA of Y. ruckeri to reduce the cytotoxic effect of holomycin during holomycin production."
"Streptomyces spp. as efficient expression system for a D,D-peptidase/D,D-carboxypeptidase involved in glycopeptide antibiotic resistance.",23497129,"VanYn, encoded by the dbv7 gene (also known as vanYn) of the biosynthetic cluster devoted to A40926 production, is a novel protein involved in the mechanism of self-resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727. This filamentous actinomycete is an uncommon microorganism, difficult-to-handle but biotechnologically valuable since it produces the glycopeptide antibiotic A40926, which is the precursor of the second-generation dalbavancin in phase III of clinical development. In order to investigate VanYn role in glycopeptide resistance in the producer actinomycete an appropriate host-vector expression system is required."
Product-mediated regulation of pentalenolactone biosynthesis in Streptomyces species by the MarR/SlyA family activators PenR and PntR.,23316039,"The orthologous penR and pntR genes from the pentalenolactone biosynthetic gene clusters of Streptomyces exfoliatus UC5319 and S. arenae TÜ469, respectively, were predicted to encode MarR/SlyA family transcriptional regulators, responsible for regulation of the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid antibiotic pentalenolactone. The intrinsic target DNA sequences and small molecule ligands of purified recombinant PenR and PntR were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. PenR bound to DNA from both the penR-gapN and penM-penH intergenic regions, while PntR bound only the corresponding pntR-gapR intergenic region. The targets of PenR and PntR were shown to be limited to conserved 37-bp DNA segments. Pentalenolactone and two late-stage biosynthetic intermediates, pentalenolactones D and F, act as ligands of both PenR and PntR, resulting in release of these proteins from their target DNA. The production of pentalenolactones was significantly decreased in the penR deletion mutant S. exfoliatus ΔpenR ZD27 but could be restored by complementation with either penR or pntR. Reverse transcription-PCR established that transcription of pentalenolactone biosynthetic and resistance genes decreased, while that of the penR gene itself increased in the penR deletion mutant S. exfoliatus ZD27 compared to the wild-type strain. The PenR protein thus serves as a positive regulator of pentalenolactone biosynthesis and self-resistance while acting as an autorepressor of penR."
"The structure of DesR from Streptomyces venezuelae, a β-glucosidase involved in macrolide activation.",23225731,"Antibiotics have, indeed, altered the course of human history as is evidenced by the increase in human life expectancy since the 1940s. Many of these natural compounds are produced by bacteria that, by necessity, must have efficient self-resistance mechanisms. The methymycin/pikromycin producing species Streptomyces venezuelae, for example, utilizes β-glucosylation of its macrolide products to neutralize their effects within the confines of the cell. Once released into the environment, these compounds are activated by the removal of the glucose moiety. In S. venezuelae, the enzyme responsible for removal of the sugar from the parent compound is encoded by the desR gene and referred to as DesR. It is a secreted enzyme containing 828 amino acid residues, and it is known to be a retaining glycosidase. Here, we describe the structure of the DesR/D-glucose complex determined to 1.4-Å resolution. The overall architecture of the enzyme can be envisioned in terms of three regions: a catalytic core and two auxiliary domains. The catalytic core harbors the binding platform for the glucose ligand. The first auxiliary domain adopts a ""PA14 fold,"" whereas the second auxiliary domain contains an immunoglobulin-like fold. Asp 273 and Glu 578 are in the proper orientation to function as the catalytic base and proton donor, respectively, required for catalysis. The overall fold of the core region places DesR into the GH3 glycoside hydrolase family of enzymes. Comparison of the DesR structure with the β-glucosidase from Kluyveromyces marxianus shows that their PA14 domains assume remarkably different orientations."
Probing the molecular mechanisms for pristinamycin yield enhancement in Streptomyces pristinaespiralis.,22991052,"The mechanisms for the enhancement of pristinamycin production in the high-yielding recombinants of Streptomyces pristinaespiralis obtained by genome shuffling were investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) techniques. Q-PCR analysis showed that snaB and snbA involved, respectively, in the biosynthesis of pristinamycins II and I component had more extended high expression in the recombinant than that in the ancestor during fermentation process, indicating their expression changes might be key factors during the biosynthesis of the antibiotic. In addition, the antecedent establishment of the high self-resistance to pristinamycin, because ptr resistance gene started high-level expression ahead of the onset of the antibiotic production in the recombinant, might also lead to the increase of the antibiotics yield. AFLP analysis of these recombinants revealed genome variation of two novel genes, the homologs of AfsR regulatory gene and transposase gene, indicating these two gene variations were probably responsible for yield improvement of pristinamycin. This study provided several potential molecular clues for pristinamycin yield enhancement."
Self-resistance to an antitumor antibiotic: a DNA glycosylase triggers the base-excision repair system in yatakemycin biosynthesis.,22987648,"Resistance is (not) futile: The yatakemycin biosynthetic gene cluster involves the ytkR2 gene, which encodes a protein with homology to a recently discovered bacterial DNA glycosylase. Genetic validation in vivo, biochemical assays, and in vitro mutagenesis studies revealed that YtkR2 confers resistance for the bacteria by specifically recognizing and cleaving the YTM-modified base (see scheme)."
New secreted toxins and immunity proteins encoded within the Type VI secretion system gene cluster of Serratia marcescens.,22957938,"Protein secretion systems are critical to bacterial virulence and interactions with other organisms. The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is found in many bacterial species and is used to target either eukaryotic cells or competitor bacteria. However, T6SS-secreted proteins have proven surprisingly elusive. Here, we identified two secreted substrates of the antibacterial T6SS from the opportunistic human pathogen, Serratia marcescens. Ssp1 and Ssp2, both encoded within the T6SS gene cluster, were confirmed as antibacterial toxins delivered by the T6SS. Four related proteins encoded around the Ssp proteins ('Rap' proteins) included two specifically conferring self-resistance ('immunity') against T6SS-dependent Ssp1 or Ssp2 toxicity. Biochemical characterization revealed specific, tight binding between cognate Ssp-Rap pairs, forming complexes of 2:2 stoichiometry. The atomic structures of two Rap proteins were solved, revealing a novel helical fold, dependent on a structural disulphide bond, a structural feature consistent with their functional localization. Homologues of the Serratia Ssp and Rap proteins are found encoded together within other T6SS gene clusters, thus they represent founder members of new families of T6SS-secreted and cognate immunity proteins. We suggest that Ssp proteins are the original substrates of the S. marcescens T6SS, before horizontal acquisition of other T6SS-secreted toxins. Molecular insight has been provided into how pathogens utilize antibacterial T6SSs to overcome competitors and succeed in polymicrobial niches."
"Characterization of VanYn, a novel D,D-peptidase/D,D-carboxypeptidase involved in glycopeptide antibiotic resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727.",22788848,"VanY(n) is a novel protein involved in the mechanism of self-resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727, which produces the glycopeptide antibiotic A40926, the precursor of the second-generation dalbavancin, which is in phase III of clinical development. VanY(n) (196 residues) is encoded by the dbv7 gene within the dbv biosynthetic cluster devoted to A40926 production. C-terminal His6-tagged VanY(n) was successfully expressed as a soluble and active protein in Escherichia coli. The analysis of the sequence suggests the presence of a hydrophobic transmembrane portion and two conserved sequences (SxHxxGxAxD and ExxH) in the extracytoplasmic domain that are potentially involved in coordination of Zn(2+) and catalytic activity. The presence of these conserved sequences indicates a similar mechanism of action and substrate binding in VanY(n) as in VanY, VanX and VanXY Zn(2+)-dependent D,D-carboxypeptidases and D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptidases acting on peptidoglycan maturation and involved in glycopeptide resistance in pathogens. On substrates mimicking peptidoglycan precursors, VanY(n) shows D,D-carboxypeptidase and D,D-dipeptidase activity, but lacks D,D-carboxyesterase ability on D-Ala-D-Lac-terminating peptides. VanY(n) belongs to the metallo-D,D-carboxypeptidase family, but it is inhibited by β-lactams. Its characterization provides new insights into the evolution and transfer of resistance determinants from environmental glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes (such as Nonomuraea sp.) to glycopeptide-resistant pathogens (enterococci and staphylococci). It may also contribute to an early warning system for emerging resistance mechanisms following the introduction into clinics of a second-generation glycopeptide such as dalbavancin."
"Function of cytochrome P450 enzymes MycCI and MycG in Micromonospora griseorubida, a producer of the macrolide antibiotic mycinamicin.",22547618,"The cytochrome P450 enzymes MycCI and MycG are encoded within the mycinamicin biosynthetic gene cluster and are involved in the biosynthesis of mycinamicin II (a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic produced by Micromonospora griseorubida). Based on recent enzymatic studies, MycCI is characterized as the C-21 methyl hydroxylase of mycinamicin VIII, while MycG is designated multifunctional P450, which catalyzes hydroxylation and also epoxidation at C-14 and C-12/13 on the macrolactone ring of mycinamicin. Here, we confirm the functions of MycCI and MycG in M. griseorubida. Protomycinolide IV and mycinamicin VIII accumulated in the culture broth of the mycCI disruption mutant; moreover, the mycCI gene fragment complemented the production of mycinamicin I and mycinamicin II, which are produced as major mycinamicins by the wild strain M. griseorubida A11725. The mycG disruption mutant did not produce mycinamicin I and mycinamicin II; however, mycinamicin IV accumulated in the culture broth. The mycG gene was located immediately downstream of the self-resistance gene myrB. The mycG gene under the control of mycGp complemented the production of mycinamicin I and mycinamicin II. Furthermore, the amount of mycinamicin II produced by the strain complemented with the mycG gene under the control of myrBp was approximately 2-fold higher than that produced by the wild strain. In M. griseorubida, MycG recognized mycinamicin IV, mycinamicin V, and also mycinamicin III as the substrates. Moreover, it catalyzed hydroxylation and also epoxidation at C-14 and C-12/13 on these intermediates. However, C-14 on mycinamicin I was not hydroxylated."
A new class of IMP dehydrogenase with a role in self-resistance of mycophenolic acid producing fungi.,21923907,"Many secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi have potent biological activities, to which the producer organism must be resistant. An example of pharmaceutical interest is mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressant molecule produced by several Penicillium species. The target of MPA is inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which catalyses the rate limiting step in the synthesis of guanine nucleotides. The recent discovery of the MPA biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium brevicompactum revealed an extra copy of the IMPDH-encoding gene (mpaF) embedded within the cluster. This finding suggests that the key component of MPA self resistance is likely based on the IMPDH encoded by mpaF."
Bacterial self-resistance to the natural proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A.,21882868,"Proteasome inhibitors have recently emerged as a therapeutic strategy in cancer chemotherapy, but susceptibility to drug resistance limits their efficacy. The marine actinobacterium Salinispora tropica produces salinosporamide A (NPI-0052, marizomib), a potent proteasome inhibitor and promising clinical agent in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Actinobacteria also possess 20S proteasome machinery, raising the question of self-resistance. We identified a redundant proteasome β-subunit, SalI, encoded within the salinosporamide biosynthetic gene cluster and biochemically characterized the SalI proteasome complex. The SalI β-subunit has an altered substrate specificity profile, 30-fold resistance to salinosporamide A, and cross-resistance to the FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. An A49V mutation in SalI correlates to clinical bortezomib resistance from a human proteasome β5-subunit A49T mutation, suggesting that intrinsic resistance to natural proteasome inhibitors may predict clinical outcomes."
Validation of the intact zwittermicin A biosynthetic gene cluster and discovery of a complementary resistance mechanism in Bacillus thuringiensis.,21730118,"Zwittermicin A (ZmA) is a hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide produced by certain Bacillus cereus group strains. It displays broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Its biosynthetic pathway in B. cereus has been proposed through analysis of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) modules involved in ZmA biosynthesis. In this study, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain YBT-1520 genomic DNA. The presence of known genes involved in the biosynthesis of ZmA in this BAC library was investigated by PCR techniques. Nine positive clones were identified, two of which (covering an approximately 60-kb region) could confer ZmA biosynthesis ability upon B. thuringiensis BMB171 after simultaneous transfer into this host by two compatible shuttle BAC vectors. Another previously unidentified gene cluster, named zmaWXY, was found to improve the yield of ZmA and was experimentally defined to function as a ZmA resistance transporter which expels ZmA from the cells. Putative transposase genes were detected on the flanking regions of the two gene clusters (the ZmA synthetic cluster and zmaWXY), which suggests a mobile nature of these two gene clusters. The intact ZmA gene cluster was validated, and a resistance mechanism complementary to that for zmaR (the previously identified ZmA self-resistance gene) was revealed. This study also provided a straightforward strategy to isolate and identify a huge gene cluster from Bacillus."
Self-resistance and cell wall composition in the glycopeptide producer Amycolatopsis balhimycina.,21690280,"The prevailing resistance mechanism against glycopeptides in Gram-positive pathogens involves reprogramming the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan precursors, resulting in d-alanyl-d-lactate depsipeptide termini. Amycolatopsis balhimycina produces the vancomycin-like glycopeptide balhimycin and therefore has to protect itself from the action of the glycopeptide. We studied the roles of the accessory resistance gene orthologs vanY(b), vnlR(b), and vnlS(b), which are part of the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster (represented by the subscript ""b""). The VanY(b) carboxypeptidase cleaved the terminal d-Ala from peptidoglycan precursors, and its heterologous expression enhanced glycopeptide resistance in Streptomyces coelicolor. The VanRS-like two component system VnlRS(b) was not involved in glycopeptide resistance or in the expression of the vanHAX glycopeptide resistance genes. Mature A. balhimycina peptidoglycan contained mainly tri- and tetrapeptides, with only traces of the d-Ala-d-Ala-ending pentapeptides that are binding sites for the antibiotic produced. The structure of the peptidoglycan precursor is consistent with the presence of vanHAX genes, which were identified outside the balhimycin synthesis cluster. Both wild-type and non-antibiotic-producing mutant strains synthesized peptidoglycan precursors ending mainly with d-Lac, indicating constitutive synthesis of a resistant cell wall. A. balhimycina could provide a model for an ancestral glycopeptide producer with constitutively expressed resistance genes."
Molecular cloning and identification of the laspartomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces viridochromogenes.,21640802,"The biosynthetic gene cluster for laspartomycins, a family of 11 amino acid peptide antibiotics, has been cloned and sequenced from Streptomyces viridochromogenes ATCC 29814. Annotation of a segment of 88912bp of S. viridochromogenes genomic sequence revealed the putative lpm cluster and its flanking regions which harbor 43 open reading frames. The lpm cluster, which spans approximately 60 kb, consists of 21 open reading frames. Those include four NRPS genes (lpmA/orf18, lpmB/orf25, lpmC/orf26 and lpmD/orf27), four genes (orfs 21, 22, 24 and 29) involved in the lipid tail biosynthesis and attachment, four regulatory genes (orfs 13, 19, 32 and 33) and three putative exporters or self-resistance genes (orfs 14, 20 and 30). In addition, the gene involved in the biosynthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acid Pip was also identified in the lpm cluster while the genes necessary for the biosynthesis of the rare residue diaminopropionic acid (Dap) were found to reside elsewhere on the chromosome. Interestingly, the dabA, dabB and dabC genes predicted to code for the biosynthesis of the unusual amino acid diaminobutyric acid (Dab) are organized into the lpm cluster even though the Dab residue was not found in the laspartomycins. Disruption of the NRPS lpmC gene completely abolished laspartomycin production in the corresponding mutant strain. These findings will allow molecular engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis approaches to expand the structural diversity of the amphomycin-group peptide antibiotics including the laspartomycins and friulimicins."
Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the TetR-like efflux pump regulator SimR.,21393832,"Crystals of SimR were grown by vapour diffusion. The protein crystallized with trigonal symmetry and X-ray data were recorded to a resolution of 2.3 Å from a single crystal at the synchrotron. SimR belongs to the TetR family of bacterial transcriptional regulators. In the absence of the antibiotic simocyclinone, SimR represses the transcription of a divergently transcribed gene encoding the simocyclinone efflux pump SimX in Streptomyces antibioticus by binding to operators in the simR-simX intergenic region. Simocyclinone binding causes SimR to dissociate from its operators, leading to expression of the SimX efflux pump. Thus, SimR represents an intimate link between the biosynthesis of simocyclinone and its export, which may also provide the mechanism of self-resistance to the antibiotic in the producer strain."
Improvement of antibiotic productivity by knock-out of dauW in Streptomyces coeruleobidus.,21242069,"Daunorubicin (DNR) is an important anthracycline antibiotic. Its biosynthesis pathway has been well understood, however, the regulation of DNR biosynthesis needs further investigations. An ORF cloned between drrB and dnrX from the genome of a DNR producer, Streptomyces coeruleobidus DM, was named dauW and designated as an orthologous gene with dnrW and drrD. Several plasmids were constructed for over-expression and/or disruption of dauW in DM. Complete disruption of dauW can significantly increase the yield of DNR. We also found that the transcription level of dnrI, a major regulatory protein in the biosynthesis of DNR, and the self-resistance level were improved in dauW knock-out mutant. These results suggested that dauW may be a down-regulatory gene for DNR biosynthesis. Antibiotics productivity in S. coeruleobidus could be improved via regulation of the transcription of dnrI, a SARP regulator. The production of DNR in a high-producer and the yield of epi-DNR in an engineering strain were also increased by disruption of dauW."
Only half the transcriptomic differences between resistant genetically modified and conventional rice are associated with the transgene.,21040388,"Besides the intended effects that give a genetically modified (GM) plant the desired trait, unintended differences between GM and non-GM comparable plants may also occur. Profiling technologies allow their identification, and a number of examples demonstrating that unintended effects are limited and diverse have recently been reported. Both from the food safety aspect and for research purposes, it is important to discern unintended changes produced by the transgene and its expression from those that may be attributed to other factors. Here, we show differential expression of around 0.40% transcriptome between conventional rice var. Senia and Senia-afp constitutively expressing the AFP antifungal protein. Analysis of one-fifth of the regulated sequences showed that around 35% of the unintended effects could be attributed to the process used to produce GM plants, based on in vitro tissue culture techniques. A further ∼15% were event specific, and their regulation was attributed to host gene disruption and genome rearrangements at the insertion site, and effects on proximal sequences. Thus, only around half the transcriptional unintended effects could be associated to the transgene itself. A significant number of changes in Senia-afp and Senia are part of the plant response to stress conditions, and around half the sequences for which up-regulation was attributed to the transgene were induced in conventional (but not transgenic) plants after wounding. Unintended effects might, as such, putatively result in widening the self-resistance characteristics because of the transgene in GM plants."
Microbisporicin gene cluster reveals unusual features of lantibiotic biosynthesis in actinomycetes.,20628010,"Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide antibiotics. The biosynthetic gene cluster for microbisporicin, a potent lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Microbispora corallina containing chlorinated tryptophan and dihydroxyproline residues, was identified by genome scanning and isolated from an M. corallina cosmid library. Heterologous expression in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 confirmed that all of the genes required for microbisporicin biosynthesis were present in the cluster. Deletion, in M. corallina, of the gene (mibA) predicted to encode the prepropeptide abolished microbisporicin production. Further deletion analysis revealed insights into the biosynthesis of this unusual and potentially clinically useful lantibiotic, shedding light on mechanisms of regulation and self-resistance. In particular, we report an example of the involvement of a tryptophan halogenase in the modification of a ribosomally synthesized peptide and the pathway-specific regulation of an antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster by an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor-anti-sigma factor complex."
Transannular disulfide formation in gliotoxin biosynthesis and its role in self-resistance of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus.,20593880,"Gliotoxin (1), the infamous representative of the group of epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs), is a virulence factor of the human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The unique redox-sensitive transannular disulfide bridge is critical for deleterious effects caused by redox cycling and protein conjugation in the host. Through a combination of genetic, biochemical, and chemical analyses, we found that 1 results from GliT-mediated oxidation of the corresponding dithiol. In vitro studies using purified GliT demonstrate that the FAD-dependent, homodimeric enzyme utilizes molecular oxygen as terminal electron acceptor with concomitant formation of H(2)O(2). In analogy to the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase superfamily, a model for dithiol-disulfide exchange involving the conserved CxxC motif is proposed. Notably, while all studied disulfide oxidases invariably form intra- or interchenar disulfide bonds in peptides, GliT is the first studied enzyme producing an epidithio bond. Furthermore, through sensitivity assays using wild type, Delta gliT mutant, and complemented strain, we found that GliT confers resistance to the producing organism. A phylogenetic study revealed that GliT falls into a clade of yet fully uncharacterized fungal gene products deduced from putative ETP biosynthesis gene loci. GliT thus not only represents the prototype of ETP-forming enzymes in eukaryotes but also delineates a novel mechanism for self-resistance."
Novel mechanism of glycopeptide resistance in the A40926 producer Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727.,20308385,"In glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and staphylococci, high-level resistance is achieved by replacing the C-terminal d-alanyl-d-alanine of lipid II with d-alanyl-d-lactate, thus reducing glycopeptide affinity for cell wall targets. Reorganization of the cell wall in these organisms is directed by the vanHAX gene cluster. Similar self-resistance mechanisms have been reported for glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes. We investigated glycopeptide resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727, the producer of the glycopeptide A40926, which is the precursor of the semisynthetic antibiotic dalbavancin, which is currently in phase III clinical trials. The MIC of Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 toward A40926 during vegetative growth was 4 microg/ml, but this increased to ca. 20 microg/ml during A40926 production. vanHAX gene clusters were not detected in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 by Southern hybridization or by PCR with degenerate primers. However, the dbv gene cluster for A40926 production contains a gene, vanY (ORF7), potentially encoding an enzyme capable of removing the terminal d-Ala residue of pentapeptide peptidoglycan precursors. Analysis of UDP-linked peptidoglycan precursors in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 revealed the predominant presence of the tetrapeptide UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-meso-Dap-d-Ala and only traces of the pentapeptide UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-meso-Dap-d-Ala-d-Ala. This suggested a novel mechanism of glycopeptide resistance in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 that was based on the d,d-carboxypeptidase activity of vanY. Consistent with this, a vanY-null mutant of Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 demonstrated a reduced level of glycopeptide resistance, without affecting A40926 productivity. Heterologous expression of vanY in a sensitive Streptomyces species, Streptomyces venezuelae, resulted in higher levels of glycopeptide resistance."
Functional and kinetic analysis of the phosphotransferase CapP conferring selective self-resistance to capuramycin antibiotics.,20202936,"Capuramycin-related compounds, including A-500359s and A-503083s, are nucleoside antibiotics that inhibit the enzyme bacterial translocase I involved in peptidoglycan cell wall biosynthesis. Within the biosynthetic gene cluster for the A-500359s exists a gene encoding a putative aminoglycoside 3-phosphotransferase that was previously demonstrated to be highly expressed during the production of A-500359s and confers selective resistance to capuramycins when expressed in heterologous hosts. A similar gene (capP) was identified within the biosynthetic gene cluster for the A-503083s, and CapP is now shown to similarly confer selective resistance to capuramycins. Recombinant CapP was produced and purified from Escherichia coli, and the function of CapP is established as an ATP-dependent capuramycin phosphotransferase that regio-specifically transfers the gamma-phosphate to the 3''-hydroxyl of the unsaturated hexuronic acid moiety of A-503083 B. Kinetic analysis with the three major A-503083 congeners suggests that CapP preferentially phosphorylates A-503083s containing an aminocaprolactam moiety attached to the hexuronic acid, and bi-substrate kinetic analysis was consistent with CapP employing a sequential kinetic mechanism similar to most known aminoglycoside 3-phosphotransferases. The purified CapP product lost its antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, and this loss in bioactivity is primarily due to a 272-fold increase in the IC(50) in the bacterial translocase I-catalyzed reaction. The results establish CapP-mediated phosphorylation as a mechanism of resistance to capuramycins and now set the stage to explore this strategy of resistance as a potential mechanism inherent to pathogens and provide the impetus for preparing second generation analogues as a preemptive strike to such resistance strategies."
Isolation and purification of a new kalimantacin/batumin-related polyketide antibiotic and elucidation of its biosynthesis gene cluster.,20189105,"Kal/bat, a polyketide, isolated to high purity (>95%) is characterized by strong and selective antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus species (minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.05 microg/mL), and no resistance was observed in strains already resistant to commonly used antibiotics. The kal/bat biosynthesis gene cluster was determined to a 62 kb genomic region of Pseudomonas fluorescens BCCM_ID9359. The kal/bat gene cluster consists of 16 open reading frames (ORF), encoding a hybrid PKS-NRPS system, extended with trans-acting tailoring functions. A full model for kal/bat biosynthesis is postulated and experimentally tested by gene inactivation, structural confirmation (using NMR spectroscopy), and complementation. The structural and microbiological study of biosynthetic kal/bat analogs revealed the importance of the carbamoyl group and 17-keto group for antibacterial activity. The mechanism of self-resistance lies within the production of an inactive intermediate, which is activated in a one-step enzymatic oxidation upon export. The genetic basis and biochemical elucidation of the biosynthesis pathway of this antibiotic will facilitate rational engineering for the design of novel structures with improved activities. This makes it a promising new therapeutic option to cope with multidrug-resistant clinical infections."
Daunorubicin efflux in Streptomyces peucetius modulates biosynthesis by feedback regulation.,20158521,"Streptomyces peucetius self-resistance genes drrA and drrB encode membrane-associated proteins that function like an ABC transporter for the efflux of daunorubicin and to maintain a constant subinhibitory physiological concentration of the drug within the cell. In this study, the drrA and drrB operons were disrupted for investigating drug production, self-resistance and regulation. The drrA-drrB null mutant was highly sensitive to daunorubicin. A 10-fold decrease in drug production was observed in the null mutant compared with the wild-type strain. We propose that the absence of a drug-specific efflux pump increases the intracellular concentration of daunorubicin, which is sensed by the organism to turn down drug production. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the mutant showed a drastic reduction in the expression of the key regulator dnrI and polyketide synthase gene dpsA. However, the expression of regulatory genes dnrO and dnrN was increased. Feedback regulation based on the intracellular daunorubicin concentration is discussed."
Molecular cloning and heterologous expression of a biosynthetic gene cluster for the antitubercular agent D-cycloserine produced by Streptomyces lavendulae.,20086163,"In the present study, we successfully cloned a 21-kb DNA fragment containing a d-cycloserine (DCS) biosynthetic gene cluster from a DCS-producing Streptomyces lavendulae strain, ATCC 11924. The putative gene cluster consists of 10 open reading frames (ORFs), designated dcsA to dcsJ. This cluster includes two ORFs encoding D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase (dcsI) and a putative membrane protein (dcsJ) as the self-resistance determinants of the producer organism, indicated by our previous work. When the 10 ORFs were introduced into DCS-nonproducing Streptomyces lividans 66 as a heterologous host cell, the transformant acquired DCS productivity. This reveals that the introduced genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of DCS. As anticipated, the disruption of dcsG, seen in the DCS biosynthetic gene cluster, made it possible for the strain ATCC 11924 to lose its DCS production. We here propose the DCS biosynthetic pathway. First, L-serine is O acetylated by a dcsE-encoded enzyme homologous to homoserine O-acetyltransferase. Second, O-acetyl-L-serine accepts hydroxyurea via an O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase homolog (dcsD product) and forms O-ureido-L-serine. The hydroxyurea must be supplied by the catalysis of a dcsB-encoded arginase homolog using the L-arginine derivative, N(G)-hydroxy-L-arginine. The resulting O-ureido-L-serine is then racemized to O-ureido-D-serine by a homolog of diaminopimelate epimerase. Finally, O-ureido-D-serine is cyclized to form DCS with the release of ammonia and carbon dioxide. The cyclization must be done by the dcsG or dcsH product, which belongs to the ATP-grasp fold family of protein."
"Disruption of cagA, the apoprotein gene of chromoprotein antibiotic C-1027, eliminates holo-antibiotic production, but not the cytotoxic chromophore.",19845765,"C-1027 is a chromoprotein of the nine-membered enediyne antitumour antibiotic family, comprising apoprotein to stabilize and transport the enediyne chromophore. The disruption of apoprotein gene cagA within the C-1027 biosynthetic gene cluster abolished C-1027 holo-antibiotic production detected by an antibacterial assay, as well as the expression of the apoprotein and C-1027 chromophore extracted following protein precipitation of the culture supernatant. Complementation of the cagA-disrupted mutant AKO with the intact cagA gene restored C-1027 production, suggesting that cagA is indispensable for holo-antibiotic production. Overexpression of cagA in the wild-type strain resulted in a significant increase in C-1027 production as expected. Surprisingly, electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses suggested that the AKO mutant still produced the C-1027 enediyne chromophore [m/z=844 (M+H)(+)] and its aromatized product [m/z=846 (M+H)(+)]. Consistent with this, the results from gene expression analysis using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that transcripts of the positive regulator sgcR3 and the structural genes sgcA1, sgcC4, sgcD6 and sgcE were readily detected in the AKO mutant as well as in the wild-type and the complementation strain. These results provided, for the first time, evidence suggesting that the apoprotein of C-1027 is not essential in the self-resistance mechanism for the enediyne chromophore."
Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster of A-500359s in Streptomyces griseus SANK60196.,19478828,"A-500359s, produced by Streptomyces griseus SANK60196, are inhibitors of bacterial phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase. They are composed of three distinct moieties: a 5'-carbamoyl uridine, an unsaturated hexuronic acid and an aminocaprolactam. Two contiguous cosmids covering a 65-kb region of DNA and encoding 38 open reading frames (ORFs) putatively involved in the biosynthesis of A-500359s were identified. Reverse transcriptase PCR showed that most of the 38 ORFs are highly expressed during A-500359s production, but mutants that do not produce A-500359s did not express these same ORFs. Furthermore, orf21, encoding a putative aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase, was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and Streptomyces albus, yielding strains having selective resistance against A-500359B, suggesting that ORF21 phosphorylates the unsaturated hexuronic acid as a mechanism of self-resistance to A-500359s. In total, the data suggest that the cloned region is involved in the resistance, regulation and biosynthesis of A-500359s."
Chapter 7. Cloning and analysis of natural product pathways.,19374983,"The identification of gene clusters of natural products has lead to an enormous wealth of information about their biosynthesis and its regulation, and about self-resistance mechanisms. Well-established routine techniques are now available for the cloning and sequencing of gene clusters. The subsequent functional analysis of the complex biosynthetic machinery requires efficient genetic tools for manipulation. Until recently, techniques for the introduction of defined changes into Streptomyces chromosomes were very time-consuming. In particular, manipulation of large DNA fragments has been challenging due to the absence of suitable restriction sites for restriction- and ligation-based techniques. The homologous recombination approach called recombineering (referred to as Red/ET-mediated recombination in this chapter) has greatly facilitated targeted genetic modifications of complex biosynthetic pathways from actinomycetes by eliminating many of the time-consuming and labor-intensive steps. This chapter describes techniques for the cloning and identification of biosynthetic gene clusters, for the generation of gene replacements within such clusters, for the construction of integrative library clones and their expression in heterologous hosts, and for the assembly of entire biosynthetic gene clusters from the inserts of individual library clones. A systematic approach toward insertional mutation of a complete Streptomyces genome is shown by the use of an in vitro transposon mutagenesis procedure."
"Analysis of RegA, a pathway-specific regulator of the friulimicin biosynthesis in Actinoplanes friuliensis.",19159651,"The rare actinomycete Actinoplanes friuliensis is the producer of the lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin, which is active against a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Enterococcus spec. and Staphylococcus aureus (MRE, MRSA) strains. Friulimicin consists of a decapeptide core and an acyl residue linked to an exocyclic amino acid. The complete biosynthetic gene cluster consisting of 24 open reading frames was characterized by sequence analysis and the transcription units were subsequently determined by RT-PCR experiments. In addition to several genes for biosynthesis, self-resistance and transport four different regulatory genes (regA, regB, regC and regD) were identified within the cluster. To analyse the role of the pathway-specific regulatory protein RegA in the friulimicin biosynthesis, the corresponding gene was inactivated resulting in friulimicin non-producing mutants. Furthermore, several protein-binding sites within the friulimicin gene cluster were identified by gel retardation assays. By real-time RT-PCR experiments, it was shown that the majority of the friulimicin biosynthetic genes is positively regulated by RegA."
An O-phosphotransferase catalyzes phosphorylation of hygromycin A in the antibiotic-producing organism Streptomyces hygroscopicus.,18644964,"The antibiotic hygromycin A (HA) binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits protein synthesis in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The HA biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 2388 contains 29 open reading frames, which have been assigned putative roles in biosynthesis, pathway regulation, and self-resistance. The hyg21 gene encodes an O-phosphotransferase with a proposed role in self-resistance. We observed that insertional inactivation of hyg21 in S. hygroscopicus leads to a greater than 90% decrease in HA production. The wild type and the hyg21 mutant were comparably resistant to HA. Using Escherichia coli as a heterologous host, we expressed and purified Hyg21. Kinetic analyses revealed that the recombinant protein catalyzes phosphorylation of HA (K(m) = 30 +/- 4 microM) at the C-2''' position of the fucofuranose ring in the presence of ATP (K(m) = 200 +/- 20 microM) or GTP (K(m) = 350 +/- 60 microM) with a k(cat) of 2.2 +/- 0.1 min(-1). The phosphorylated HA is inactive against HA-sensitive Delta tolC E. coli and Streptomyces lividans. Hyg21 also phosphorylates methoxyhygromycin A and desmethylenehygromycin A with k(cat) and K(m) values similar to those observed with HA. Phosphorylation of the naturally occurring isomers of 5'''-dihydrohygromycin A and 5'''-dihydromethoxyhygromycin A was about 12 times slower than for the corresponding non-natural isomers. These studies demonstrate that Hyg21 is an O-phosphotransferase with broad substrate specificity, tolerating changes in the aminocyclitol moiety more than in the fucofuranose moiety, and that phosphorylation by Hyg21 is one of several possible mechanisms of self-resistance in S. hygroscopicus NRRL 2388."
Involvement of a chromomycin ABC transporter system in secretion of a deacetylated precursor during chromomycin biosynthesis.,17768249,"Chromomycin A(3) is an antitumour antibiotic that acts by inhibiting transcription and replication of DNA. The producer micro-organism Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus is highly resistant to chromomycin A(3) and to the structurally related compound mithramycin upon induction with chromomycin A(3). The biosynthetic gene cluster of chromomycin contains three genes involved in self-resistance to chromomycin in S. griseus: cmrA and cmrB encode a type I ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, and cmrX encodes a UvrA-like protein of ABC excision nuclease systems. These genes are linked in the chromosome, together with a gene encoding a transcriptional repressor (cmmRII). Involvement of these genes in chromomycin resistance was determined through gene inactivation, and heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus. Inactivation of cmrX produced a chromomycin-sensitive low-producer strain, while inactivation of cmmRII generated a high-chromomycin-producer strain, which was resistant to chromomycin, and also to mithramycin. Expression of either cmrA and cmrB, or cmrX, in S. albus generated strains with low chromomycin resistance; it was therefore necessary to co-express the three genes to achieve high levels of resistance. However, the CmrAB ABC transporter conferred a high level of resistance to the biosynthesis intermediate 4A,4E-O-dideacetyl-chromomycin A(3). A model is proposed for the biosynthesis of, and self-resistance to, chromomycin A(3) in S. griseus subsp. griseus."
How do antibiotic-producing bacteria ensure their self-resistance before antibiotic biosynthesis incapacitates them?,17238916,"Acquired antibiotic resistance among dangerous bacterial pathogens is an increasing medical problem. While in Mycobacterium tuberculosis this occurs by mutation in the genes encoding the targets for antibiotic action, other pathogens have generally gained their resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer from non-pathogenic bacteria. The ultimate source of many of these genes is almost certainly the actinomycetes that make the antibiotics and therefore need self-protective mechanisms to avoid suicide. How do they ensure that they are resistant at the time when intracellular antibiotic concentrations reach potentially lethal levels? In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Tahlan et al. describe a solution to this problem in which an antibiotically inactive precursor of a Streptomyces coelicolor antibiotic induces resistance -- in this example by means of a trans-membrane export pump -- so that the organism is already primed for resistance at the time when it is needed. The authors generalize their interpretation to other cases where antibiotic resistance depends on export, but it will be interesting to find out whether it could in fact apply more widely, to include the other major mechanisms of resistance: target modification and the synthesis of antibiotics via a series of chemically modified intermediates, with removal of the protective group at the time of secretion into the outside medium."
Sequencing and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster of the lipopeptide antibiotic Friulimicin in Actinoplanes friuliensis.,17220414,"Actinoplanes friuliensis produces the lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin, which is a cyclic peptide with one exocyclic amino acid linked to a branched-chain fatty acid acyl residue. The structural relationship to daptomycin and the excellent antibacterial performance of friulimicin make the antibiotic an attractive drug candidate. The complete friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster of 24 open reading frames from A. friuliensis was sequenced and analyzed. In addition to genes for regulation, self-resistance, and transport, the cluster contains genes encoding peptide synthetases, proteins involved in the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component of the antibiotic, and proteins involved in the synthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acids pipecolinic acid, methylaspartic acid, and 2,3-diaminobutyric acid. By using heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli, we provide biochemical evidence for the stereoselective synthesis of L-pipecolinic acid by the deduced protein of the lysine cyclodeaminase gene pip. Furthermore, we show the involvement of the dabA and dabB genes in the biosynthesis of 2,3-diaminobutyric acid by gene inactivation and subsequent feeding experiments."
Resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics in the teicoplanin producer is mediated by van gene homologue expression directing the synthesis of a modified cell wall peptidoglycan.,17220405,"Glycopeptide resistance has been studied in detail in enterococci and staphylococci. In these microorganisms, high-level resistance is achieved by replacing the C-terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine of the nascent peptidoglycan with D-alanyl-D-lactate or D-alanyl-D-serine, thus reducing the affinities of glycopeptides for cell wall targets. Reorganization of the cell wall is directed by the expression of the van gene clusters. The identification of van gene homologs in the genomes of several glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes suggests the involvement of a similar self-resistance mechanism to avoid suicide. This report describes a comprehensive study of self-resistance in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus ATCC 31121, the producer of the clinically relevant glycopeptide teicoplanin. A. teichomyceticus ATCC 31121 showed a MIC of teicoplanin of 25 microg/ml and a MIC of vancomycin of 90 microg/ml during vegetative growth. The vanH, vanA, and vanX genes of A. teichomyceticus were found to be organized in an operon whose transcription was constitutive. Analysis of the UDP-linked peptidoglycan precursors revealed the presence of UDP-glycomuramyl pentadepsipeptide terminating in D-alanyl-D-lactate. No trace of precursors ending in d-alanyl-d-alanine was detected. Thus, the van gene complex was transcribed and expressed in the genetic background of A. teichomyceticus and conferred resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin through the modification of cell wall biosynthesis. During teicoplanin production (maximum productivity, 70 to 80 microg/ml), the MIC of teicoplanin remained in the range of 25 to 35 microg/ml. Teicoplanin-producing cells were found to be tolerant to high concentrations of exogenously added glycopeptides, which were not bactericidal even at 5,000 microg/ml."
Detection of antibiotic-related genes from bacterial biocontrol agents with polymerase chain reaction.,16699573,"Pseudomonas chlororaphis PA23, Pseudomonas spp. strain DF41, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS6 consistently inhibit infection of canola petals by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in both greenhouse and field experiments. Bacillus thuringiensis BS8, Bacillus cereus L, and Bacillus mycoides S have shown significant inhibition against S. sclerotiorum on plate assays. The presence of antibiotic biosynthetic or self-resistance genes in these strains was investigated with polymerase chain reaction and, in one case, Southern blotting. Thirty primers were used to amplify (i) antibiotic biosythetic genes encoding phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, pyoluteorin, and pyrrolnitrin, and (ii) the zwittermicin A self-resistance gene. Our findings revealed that the fungal antagonist P. chlororaphis PA23 contains biosynthetic genes for phenazine-1-carboxylic acid and pyrrolnitrin. Moreover, production of these compounds was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography. Pseudomonas spp. DF41 and B. amyloliquefaciens BS6 do not appear to harbour genes for any of the antibiotics tested. Bacillus thuringiensis BS8, B. cereus L, and B. mycoides S contain the zwittermicin A self-resistance gene. This is the first report of zmaR in B. mycoides."
Biological function of the pld gene product that degrades epsilon-poly-L-lysine in Streptomyces albulus.,16568315,"Epsilon-poly-L-lysine (epsilon-PL) is one of the few naturally occurring biopolymers and is characterized by a peptide bond between the alpha-carboxyl and epsilon-amino groups. Previously, we purified and characterized the epsilon-PL-degrading enzyme (Pld) from Streptomyces albulus, which is an epsilon-PL producer, and this enzyme was expected to confer self-resistance to the epsilon-PL produced by the organism itself. The gene encoding Pld was cloned based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence determined in this study, and a sequencing analysis revealed eight open reading frames (ORFs), i.e., ORF1 to ORF8 in the flanking region surrounding the pld gene (present in ORF5). To investigate the biological function of Pld, we constructed a knockout mutant in which the pld gene is inactivated. Studies on epsilon-PL susceptibility, epsilon-PL-degrading activity, and epsilon-PL productivity demonstrated that the pld gene does play a partial role in self-resistance and that S. albulus was found to produce other epsilon-PL-degrading enzyme(s) in addition to Pld. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a self-resistance gene for a biopolymer possessing antibacterial activity."
Molecular cloning and characterization of gene encoding novel puromycin-inactivating enzyme from blasticidin S-producing Streptomyces morookaensis.,16503293,"Puromycin (PM) is classified into a family of nucleoside antibiotics together with blasticidin S (BS). PM-producing Streptomyces alboniger is known to express a PM-inactivating enzyme as a self-resistance determinant, which catalyzes the acetylation of PM. We have shown that, although BS-producing Streptomyces morookaensis also produces a PM-inactivating enzyme, it catalyzes the hydrolysis of an amide linkage between the aminonucleoside and O-methyl-L-tyrosine moiety of PM. In the present study, we cloned and characterized a gene encoding PM hydrolase (PMH) from BS-producing S. morookaensis JCM4673. The nucleotide sequence analysis suggests that an open reading frame consisting of 1986 bp is a gene for PMH and encodes a protein consisting of 662 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 71,260 Da. The molecular mass of the recombinant PMH, which was produced using an Escherichia coli host-vector system, was the same as that of PMH purified from the JCM4673 strain. Our biochemical study of the recombinant PMH confirmed that the enzyme is an aminopeptidase with broad substrate specificity. The putative primary structure of PMH contains a Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly motif, which is commonly observed among serine proteases. In addition, the amino acid sequence of PMH displays a high similarity to that of the Streptomyces acyl-peptide hydrolase (ACPH), which is a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) family of serine proteases. Furthermore, the catalytic triad (Ser-Asp-His), which is observed in the POP family, is also present in the primary structure of PMH. These results suggest that PMH is an aminopeptidase classified into the POP family."
"Horizontal transfer of iturin A operon, itu, to Bacillus subtilis 168 and conversion into an iturin A producer.",16251307,"Iturin A and its derivatives are lipopeptide antibiotics produced by Bacillus subtilis and several closely related bacteria. Three iturin group operons (i.e., iturin A, mycosubtilin, and bacillomycin D) of those antibiotic-producing strains have been cloned and sequenced thus far, strongly implying the horizontal transfer of these operons. To examine the nature of such horizontal transfer in terms of antibiotic production, a 42-kb region of the B. subtilis RB14 genome, which contains a complete 38-kb iturin A operon, was transferred via competent cell transformation to the genome of a non-iturin A producer, B. subtilis 168, using a method based on double-crossover homologous recombination with two short landing pad sequences (LPSs) in the genome. The recombinant was positively selected by confirming the elimination of the cI repressor gene, which was localized between the two LPSs and substituted by the transferred segment. The iturin A operon-transferred strain 168 was then converted into an iturin A producer by the introduction of an sfp gene, which encodes 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase and is mutated in strain 168. By inserting the pleiotropic regulator degQ, the productivity of iturin A increased sevenfold and was restored to about half that of the donor strain RB14, without the transfer of additional genes, such as regulatory or self-resistance genes."
"Self-protection mechanism in D-cycloserine-producing Streptomyces lavendulae. Gene cloning, characterization, and kinetics of its alanine racemase and D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase, which are target enzymes of D-cycloserine.",15302885,"An antibiotic, D-cycloserine (DCS), inhibits the catalytic activities of alanine racemase (ALR) and d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase (DDL), which are necessary for the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. In this study, we cloned both genes encoding ALR and DDL, designated alrS and ddlS, respectively, from DCS-producing Streptomyces lavendulae ATCC25233. Each gene product was purified to homogeneity and characterized. Escherichia coli, transformed with a pET vector carrying alrS or ddlS, displays higher resistance to DCS than the same host carrying the E. coli ALR- or DDL-encoded gene inserted into the pET vector. Although the S. lavendulae DDL was competitively inhibited by DCS, the K(i) value (920 microM) was obviously higher (40 approximately 100-fold) than those for E. coli DdlA (9 microM) or DdlB (27 microM). The high K(i) value of the S. lavendulae DDL suggests that the enzyme may be a self-resistance determinant in the DCS-producing microorganism. Kinetic studies for the S. lavendulae ALR suggest that the time-dependent inactivation rate of the enzyme by DCS is absolutely slower than that of the E. coli ALR. We conclude that ALR from DCS-producing S. lavendulae is also one of the self-resistance determinants."
Biosynthesis of the angiogenesis inhibitor borrelidin by Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055: cluster analysis and assignment of functions.,15112998,"The biosynthetic gene cluster for the angiogenesis inhibitor borrelidin has been cloned from Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055. Sequence analysis indicates that the macrolide ring of borrelidin is formed by a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) (borA1-A6), a result that was confirmed by disruption of borA3. The borrelidin PKS is striking because only seven rather than the nine modules expected for a nonaketide product are encoded by borA1-A6. The starter unit of the PKS has been verified as trans-cyclopentane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (trans-1,2-CPDA), and the genes involved in its biosynthesis identified. Other genes responsible for biosynthesis of the nitrile moiety, regulation, and self-resistance were also identified."
Membrane topology of the DrrB protein of the doxorubicin transporter of Streptomyces peucetius.,15090538,"Daunorubicin and doxorubicin, two commonly used anticancer agents, are produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces peucetius. Self-resistance to these antibiotics in S. peucetius is conferred by the drrAB locus that codes for two proteins, DrrA and DrrB. DrrA is an ATP-binding protein. It belongs to the ABC family of transporters and shares sequence and functional similarities with P-glycoprotein of cancer cells. DrrB is an integral membrane protein that might function as a transporter for the efflux of daunorubicin and doxorubicin. Together, DrrA and DrrB are believed to form an ATP-driven pump for the efflux of these drugs. The drrAB locus has been cloned, and the two proteins have been expressed in a functional form in Escherichia coli. A topological analysis of the DrrB protein was performed using gene fusion methodology. Random and site-directed fusions of the drrB gene to lacZ, phoA, or gfp reporter genes were created. Based on the fusion data, a topological model of the DrrB protein is proposed in which the protein has eight membrane-spanning domains with both the N terminus and the C terminus in the cytoplasm."
Genetics of zwittermicin a production by Bacillus cereus.,14711631,"Zwittermicin A represents a new chemical class of antibiotic and has diverse biological activities, including suppression of oomycete diseases of plants and potentiation of the insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis. To identify genes involved in zwittermicin A production, we generated 4,800 transposon mutants of B. cereus UW101C and screened them for zwittermicin A accumulation. Nine mutants did not produce detectable zwittermicin A, and one mutant produced eightfold more than the parent strain. The DNA flanking the transposon insertions in six of the nine nonproducing mutants contains significant sequence similarity to genes involved in peptide and polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis. The mutant that overproduced zwittermicin A contained a transposon insertion immediately upstream from a gene that encodes a deduced protein that is a member of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators. Three genes identified by the mutant analysis mapped to a region that was previously shown to carry the zwittermicin A self-resistance gene, zmaR, and a biosynthetic gene (E. A. Stohl, J. L. Milner, and J. Handelsman, Gene 237:403-411, 1999). Further sequencing of this region revealed genes proposed to encode zwittermicin A precursor biosynthetic enzymes, in particular, those involved in the formation of the aminomalonyl- and hydroxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein intermediates. Additionally, nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) homologs are present, suggesting that zwittermicin A is synthesized by a mixed NRPS/PKS pathway."
Beta-glucosylation as a part of self-resistance mechanism in methymycin/pikromycin producing strain Streptomyces venezuelae.,14674753,"In our study of the biosynthesis of D-desosamine in Streptomyces venezuelae, we have cloned and sequenced the entire desosamine biosynthetic cluster. The deduced product of one of the genes, desR, in this cluster shows high sequence homology to beta-glucosidases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages, a function not required for the biosynthesis of desosamine. Disruption of the desR gene led to the accumulation of glucosylated methymycin/neomethymycin products, all of which are biologically inactive. It is thus conceivable that methymycin/neomethymycin may be produced as inert diglycosides, and the DesR protein is responsible for transforming these antibiotics from their dormant to their active forms. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the translated desR gene has a leader sequence characteristic of secretory proteins, allowing it to be transported through the cell membrane and hydrolyze the modified antibiotics extracellularly to activate them. Expression of desR and biochemical characterization of the purified protein confirmed the catalytic function of this enzyme as a beta-glycosidase capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of glucosylated methymycin/neomethymycin produced by S. venezuelae. These results provide strong evidence substantiating glycosylation/deglycosylation as a likely self-resistance mechanism of S. venezuelae. However, further experiments have suggested that such a glycosylation/deglycosylation is only a secondary self-defense mechanism in S. venezuelae, whereas modification of 23S rRNA, which is the target site for methymycin and its derivatives, by PikR1 and PikR2 is a primary self-resistance mechanism. Considering that postsynthetic glycosylation is an effective means to control the biological activity of macrolide antibiotics, the availability of macrolide glycosidases, which can be used for the activation of newly formed antibiotics that have been deliberately deactivated by engineered glycosyltransferases, may be a valuable part of an overall strategy for the development of novel antibiotics using the combinatorial biosynthetic approach."
"Deciphering tuberactinomycin biosynthesis: isolation, sequencing, and annotation of the viomycin biosynthetic gene cluster.",12936980,"The tuberactinomycin antibiotics are essential components in the drug arsenal against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections and are specifically used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These antibiotics are also being investigated for their targeting of the catalytic RNAs involved in viral replication and for the treatment of bacterial infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. We report on the isolation, sequencing, and annotation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for one member of this antibiotic family, viomycin, from Streptomyces sp. strain ATCC 11861. This is the first gene cluster for a member of the tuberactinomycin family of antibiotics sequenced, and the information gained can be extrapolated to all members of this family. The gene cluster covers 36.3 kb of DNA and encodes 20 open reading frames that we propose are involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, export, and activation of viomycin, in addition to self-resistance to the antibiotic. These results enable us to predict the metabolic logic of tuberactinomycin production and begin steps toward the combinatorial biosynthesis of these antibiotics to complement existing chemical modification techniques to produce novel tuberactinomycin derivatives."
Identification and cloning of genes encoding viomycin biosynthesis from Streptomyces vinaceus and evidence for involvement of a rare oxygenase.,12909358,"The tuberactinomycins are a family of basic cyclic peptides that exhibit potent antitubercular activity. These peptides are characterized by the presence of an amino acid with a 6-membered cyclic guanidine side chain (capreomycidine) and two or more 2,3-diaminopropionate residues. Viomycin (tuberactinomycin B) is a well-studied member of the family, was once prescribed for the treatment of tuberculosis, and has been shown to block translocation during protein biosynthesis. The gene cluster encoding viomycin biosynthesis was identified and cloned from Streptomyces vinaceus. The cluster was identified by screening genomic libraries with the viomycin phosphotransferase self-resistance gene (vph) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene probes amplified from S. vinaceus genomic DNA. The viomycin cluster was localized to ca. 120 kb of contiguous DNA defined by four overlapping cosmid inserts. Each cosmid hybridized with one or more peptide synthetase gene probes and two also hybridized with vph. Confirmation that the cluster encoded viomycin biosynthesis was obtained from the disruption of two NRPS adenylation domains. Partial sequence analysis revealed an ORF (svox) predicted to encode a rare non-heme iron, alpha-ketoglutarate dependent oxygenase proposed to function in the oxidative cyclization of arginine to the capreomycidine residue. Insertional disruption of svox resulted in complete loss of viomycin production, confirming its involvement in the pathway."
Transgenic assessment of CFP-mediated cercosporin export and resistance in a cercosporin-sensitive fungus.,12073097,"Cercosporin is a toxic polyketide produced by many phytopathogenic members of the fungal genus Cercospora. Cercospora species, themselves, exhibit the highest level of self-resistance to this almost universally toxic photosensitizer. Although the mechanism of cercosporin self-resistance is multi-faceted, partial resistance does appear to be provided by the encoded product of CFP ( cercosporin facilitator protein), a gene recently isolated from the pathogen of soybean, C. kikuchii. CFP has significant similarity to the major facilitator superfamily of integral membrane transport proteins. We expressed CFP in the cercosporin non-producing, cercosporin-sensitive fungus, Cochliobolus heterostrophus, in order to assess the transport activity of CFP and the contribution of CFP to cercosporin resistance in a fungal species free of endogenous toxin production. Expression of the CFP transgene in this fungus results in increased resistance to cercosporin due, apparently, to its export out of the fungus."
"Gene yerP, involved in surfactin self-resistance in Bacillus subtilis.",11709341,"Surfactin is a cyclic lipopeptide biosurfactant. Transposon mutagenesis was performed in Bacillus subtilis strain 168, and a surfactin-susceptible mutant, strain 801, was isolated. Analysis of the region of insertion revealed that yerP was the determinant of surfactin self-resistance. YerP had homology with the resistance, nodulation, and cell division (RND) family proton motive force-dependent efflux pumps only characterized in gram-negative strains. The yerP-deficient strain 802, in which the internal region of the yerP gene of B. subtilis strain 168 was deleted, showed susceptibility to acriflavine and ethidium bromide. When strain 802 was converted to a surfactin producer by introducing a functional sfp which encodes a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase and is mutated in B. subtilis strain 168, this yerP-deficient strain produced surfactin, although surfactin production was significantly reduced. The expression of yerP was at its maximum at the end of the logarithmic growth phase and was not induced by surfactin. yerP is the first RND-like gene characterized in gram-positive strains and is supposed to be involved in the efflux of surfactin."
Engineered biosynthesis of the peptide antibiotic bacitracin in the surrogate host Bacillus subtilis.,11448966,"Nonribosomal peptides are processed on multifunctional enzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), whose modular multidomain arrangement allowed the rational design of new peptide products. However, the lack of natural competence and efficient transformation methods for most of nonribosomal peptide producer strains prevented the in vivo manipulation of these biosynthetic gene clusters. In this study, we present methods for the construction of a genetically engineered Bacillus subtilis surrogate host for the integration and heterologous expression of foreign NRPS genes. In the B. subtilis surrogate host, we deleted the resident 26-kilobase srfA gene cluster encoding the surfactin synthetases and subsequently used the same chromosomal location for integration of the entire 49-kilobase bacitracin biosynthetic gene cluster from Bacillus licheniformis by a stepwise homologous recombination method. Synthesis of the branched cyclic peptide antibiotic bacitracin in the engineered B. subtilis strain was achieved at high level, indicating a functional production and proper posttranslational modification of the bacitracin synthetases BacABC, as well as the expression of the associated bacitracin self-resistance genes. This engineered and genetically amenable B. subtilis strain will facilitate the rational design of new bacitracin derivatives."
The role of ABC transporters in antibiotic-producing organisms: drug secretion and resistance mechanisms.,11421281,Knowledge about biosynthetic gene clusters from antibiotic-producing actinomycetes is continuously increasing and the presence of an ABC transporter system is a fairly general phenomenon in most of these clusters. These transporters are involved in the secretion of the antibiotic through the cell membrane and also contribute to self resistance to the produced antibiotic.
Aspects of the biosynthesis of non-aromatic fungal polyketides by iterative polyketide synthases.,11386351,"Lovastatin biosynthesis in Aspergillus terreus involves two unusual type I multifunctional polyketide syntheses (PKSs). Lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS), the product of the lovB gene, is an iterative PKS that interacts with LovC, a putative enoyl reductase, to catalyze the 35 separate reactions in the biosynthesis of dihydromonacolin L, a lovastatin precursor. LNKS also displays Diels-Alderase activity in vitro. Lovastatin diketide synthase (LDKS) made by lovF, in contrast, acts non-iteratively like the bacterial modular PKSs to make (2R)-2-methylbutyric acid. Then, like LNKS, LDKS interacts closely with another protein, the LovD transesterase enzyme that catalyzes attachment of the 2-methylbutyric acid to monacolin J in the final step of the lovastatin pathway. Key features of the genes for these four enzymes and others, plus the regulatory and self-resistance factors involved in lovastatin production, are also described."
"ABC transporter genes, kasKLM, responsible for self-resistance of a kasugamycin producer strain.",10866219,"We previously reported that a 7.6-kb DNA fragment from Streptomyces kasugaensis M338-M1, a kasugamycin (KSM) producer, included KSM acetyltransferase gene (kac338) and some other genes possibly involved in KSM biosynthesis. As an extension of that study, a 10-kb SacI-KpnI DNA fragment, located approximately 5-15-kb upstream of kac33, was cloned and a 4.2-kb SacI-EcoRI fragment therefrom was sequenced, revealing one incomplete (designated ORF J) and three complete open reading frames (designated kasK, kasL and kasM). The coding frames of kasK, L and M overlap one another with terminator/initiator ATGA sequence. RT-PCR analysis of a DNA region including kasKLM indicated the presence of one transcript that is long enough to span the three genes. The kasK gene potentially encodes an ATP-binding protein of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. Homology search for the deduced KasK protein shows similarity to other ABC transporters involved in self-resistance of a mithramycin and possibly doxorubicin producer strain. The kasL and kasM genes encode different integral membrane proteins, both having six putative transmembrane helices. An expression plasmid for kasKLM (pTV-KLM) was constructed and these genes were expressed in E. coli JM 109, which had been sensitive to KSM. The transformant acquired resistance to KSM, suggesting that KasK, L and M proteins as a set in S. kasugaensis M338-M1 pump out KSM to protect the producer from its toxic metabolite."
"Characterization of the fomA and fomB gene products from Streptomyces wedmorensis, which confer fosfomycin resistance on Escherichia coli.",10681332,"Together, the fomA and fomB genes in the fosfomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces wedmorensis confer high-level fosfomycin resistance on Escherichia coli. To elucidate their functions, the fomA and fomB genes were overexpressed in E. coli and the gene products were characterized. The recombinant FomA protein converted fosfomycin to fosfomycin monophosphate, which was inactive on E. coli, in the presence of a magnesium ion and ATP. On the other hand, the recombinant FomB protein did not inactivate fosfomycin. However, a reaction mixture containing FomA and FomB proteins converted fosfomycin to fosfomycin monophosphate and fosfomycin diphosphate in the presence of ATP and a magnesium ion, indicating that FomA and FomB catalyzed phosphorylations of fosfomycin and fosfomycin monophosphate, respectively. These results suggest that the self-resistance mechanism of the fosfomycin-producing organism S. wedmorensis is mono- and diphosphorylation of the phosphonate function of fosfomycin catalyzed by FomA and FomB."
Zwittermicin A biosynthetic cluster.,10521664,"The goal of this study was to identify the biosynthetic cluster for zwittermicin A, a novel, broad spectrum, aminopolyol antibiotic produced by Bacillus cereus. The nucleotide sequence of 2.7kb of DNA flanking the zwittermicin A self-resistance gene, zmaR, from B. cereus UW85 revealed three open reading frames (ORFs). Of these ORFs, two had sequence similarity to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and polyketide synthases, respectively. Insertional inactivation demonstrated that orf2 is necessary for zwittermicin A production and that zmaR is necessary for high-level resistance to zwittermicin A but is not required for zwittermicin A production. Expression of ZmaR was temporally associated with zwittermicin A production. The results suggest that zmaR is part of a cluster of genes that is involved in zwittermicin A biosynthesis, representing the first biosynthetic pathway for an aminopolyol antibiotic."
"The DrrC protein of Streptomyces peucetius, a UvrA-like protein, is a DNA-binding protein whose gene is induced by daunorubicin.",9835035,"DrrC, a daunorubicin resistance protein with a strong sequence similarity to the UvrA protein involved in excision repair of DNA, is induced by daunorubicin in Streptomyces peucetius and behaves like an ATP-dependent, DNA binding protein in vitro. The refolded protein obtained from expression of the drrC gene in Escherichia coli was used to conduct gel retardation assays. DrrC bound a DNA segment containing the promoter region of a daunorubicin production gene only in the presence of ATP and daunorubicin. This result suggests that DrrC is a novel type of drug self-resistance protein with DNA binding properties like those of UvrA. Western blotting analysis with a polyclonal antiserum generated against His-tagged DrrC showed that the appearance of DrrC in S. peucetius is coincident with the onset of daunorubicin production and that the drrC gene is induced by daunorubicin. These data also showed that the DnrN and DnrI regulatory proteins are required for drrC expression. The level of DrrA, another daunorubicin resistance protein that resembles ATP-dependent bacterial antiporters, was regulated in the same way as that of DrrC."
Analysis of the carbapenem gene cluster of Erwinia carotovora: definition of the antibiotic biosynthetic genes and evidence for a novel beta-lactam resistance mechanism.,9402024,"Members of two genera of Gram-negative bacteria, Serratia and Erwinia, produce a beta-lactam antibiotic, 1-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid. We have reported previously the cloning and sequencing of the genes responsible for production of this carbapenem in Erwinia carotovora. These genes are organized as an operon, carA--H, and are controlled by a LuxR-type transcriptional activator, encoded by the linked carR gene. We report in this paper the genetic dissection of this putative operon to determine the function of each of the genes. We demonstrate by mutational analysis that the products of the first five genes of the operon are involved in the synthesis of the carbapenem molecule. Three of these, carABC, are absolutely required. In addition, we provide evidence for the existence of a novel carbapenem resistance mechanism, encoded by the CarF and carG genes. Both products of these overlapping and potentially translationally coupled genes have functional, N-terminal signal peptides. Removal of these genes from the Erwinia chromosome results in a carbapenem-sensitive phenotype. We assume that these novel beta-lactam resistance genes have evolved in concert with the biosynthetic genes to ensure 'self-resistance' in the Erwinia carbapenem producer."
Organization and nature of fortimicin A (astromicin) biosynthetic genes studied using a cosmid library of Micromonospora olivasterospora DNA.,1494349,"The cloning of five DNA segments carrying at least seven genes (fms1, fms3, fms4, fms5, fms7, fms11, and fms12) that participate in fortimicin A (astromicin) biosynthesis was described previously. These DNA fragments were used to screen a cosmid library of genomic DNA in order to examine if these biosynthetic genes are clustered in Micromonospora olivasterospora. One cosmid clone (pGLM990) was obtained, which hybridized to all the probes. Complementation analysis, using mutants blocked at various steps and chimeric plasmids subcloned from pGLM990, showed that three additional genes (fms8, fms10, and fms13) are present in pGLM990. A gene conferring self-resistance to the antibiotic, which was independently cloned in Streptomyces lividans, using the plasmid vector pIJ702 was also found to be linked to the cluster of biosynthetic genes. Thus, at least ten biosynthetic genes and a self-defense gene are clustered in a chromosomal region of about 27 kb in M. olivasterospora. Interestingly, the fms8 gene which participates in the dehydroxylation step of fortimicin A biosynthesis was found to have homology with a neomycin resistance gene nmrA from the neomycin-producing Micromonospora sp. MK50. Studies using a cell-free extract of the fms8 mutant and its parent strain showed that the enzyme encoded by fms8 phosphorylates a biosynthetic precursor, fortimicin KK1, in the presence of ATP. Thus the dehydroxylation reaction is suggested to occur via the phosphorylation of the target hydroxyl group. DNA regions homologous to fms genes were found in Micromonospora sp. SF-2098 and Dactylosporangium matsuzakiense, both producers of fortimicin group antibiotics."
Secondary aminoglycoside resistance in aminoglycoside-producing strains of Streptomyces.,1612424,"The role of aminoglycoside (AG) acetyltransferases (AACs) and of the corresponding genes in resistance to foreign AGs in AG-producing strains of Streptomyces were studied. The research focussed on (i) the activation mechanism of the cryptic kanamycin(Km)-resistance-encoding gene that encodes an AAC(3) in streptomycin-producing S. griseus SS-1198, and (ii) an AAC(2') with novel activity and substrate specificity in kasugamycin-producing S. kasugaensis MB273. Activation of the cryptic kan gene in S. griseus SS-1198 is probably due to a single base substitution at the putative -10 promoter region, leading to the enhancement of transcription, resulting in resistance to AG. The coding region of the kan gene was highly homologous to that of the aacC7 gene of paromomycin-producing S. rimosus forma paromomycinus. On the other hand, resistance in S. kasugaensis MB273 was found to be due to an AAC(2') capable of acetylating astromicin group AGs at two different sites (1-NH2 with istamycin B, and 2'-NH2 with astromicin and istamycin A). These additional antibiotic resistances that are independent of a self-resistance basis may be regarded as 'secondary' resistances, so as to distinguish them from 'primary' resistances arising from a self-resistance basis."
An unusually large multifunctional polypeptide in the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase of Saccharopolyspora erythraea.,2234082,"Erythromycin A, a clinically important polyketide antibiotic, is produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea. In an arrangement that seems to be generally true of antibiotic biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces and related bacteria like S. erythraea, the ery genes encoding the biosynthetic pathway to erythromycin are clustered around the gene (ermE) that confers self-resistance on S. erythraea. The aglycone core of erythromycin A is derived from one propionyl-CoA and six methylmalonyl-CoA units, which are incorporated head-to-tail into the growing polyketide chain, in a process similar to that of fatty-acid biosynthesis, to generate a macrolide intermediate, 6-deoxyerythronolide B. 6-Deoxyerythronolide B is converted into erythromycin A through the action of specific hydroxylases, glycosyltransferases and a methyltransferase. We report here the analysis of about 10 kilobases of DNA from S. erythraea, cloned by chromosome 'walking' outwards from the erythromycin-resistance determinant ermE, and previously shown to be essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. Partial sequencing of this region indicates that it encodes the synthase. Our results confirm this, and reveal a novel organization of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase, which provides further insight into the mechanism of chain assembly."
Molecular cloning and expression in Streptomyces lividans of a streptomycin 6-phosphotransferase gene from a streptomycin-producing microorganism.,2982666,"The gene encoding streptomycin 6-kinase involved in the self-resistance of the streptomycin-producing Streptomyces griseus HUT 6037 was cloned in the plasmid vector pIJ703. The resulting plasmid, pSP6, contained 2.5 kb inserts of S. griseus DNA. When streptomycin-susceptible S. lividans 1326 was retransformed with pSP6, all transformants produced streptomycin 6-kinase. Addition of streptomycin to the culture medium of S. lividans carrying pSP6 plasmid brought about a remarkable increase in streptomycin 6-kinase activity in the cell extracts. It is suggested from the results that the production of streptomycin 6-kinase in streptomycin producer was induced by streptomycin accumulated during cultivation."
