-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

4). Detection of precursor PSOrn from the culture supernatant of phtQ- showed that PhtQ involved in the biosynthesis of PHTs with PSOrn and L-Ala- L-hArg as substrates. Accumulation of by-products Orn-Ala-hArg and Cit-Ala-hArg from the culture supernatants of wild type strains and certain gene in frame deletion mutants might be attributed to the substrate tolerance of PhtQ. We can not rule out the possibility that there are certain uncharacterized peptide ligases participated in the formation of Orn-Ala-hArg and/or Cit-Ala-hArg. PhtL might be involved in the biosynthetic steps of PSOrn with L-Orn as a close precursor. Based on the fact that there is a phtL gene homologous (agnD1 and agnD2) in the biosynthetic gene cluster of another phosphoramidate natural product Agrocin 84282930, we assume that phtL is related to the N-P bonds formation of PHTs. ArgK catalyzed the formation of Tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg To extend our understanding about why such a great amount of by-products were accumulated, it is
