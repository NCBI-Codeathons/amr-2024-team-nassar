    "content": "However, similar to the gene-deletion experiments of berkC17, a self-resistance gene in Penicillium egyptiacum, after enormous attempts and screenings with different sucrose concentrations, it was still failed to get the sacH-deletion strain. Then E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were used as the test strain to examine the relationship between sacH-expression and the resistance against SAC-B. The results showed that the survival ratio of sacH-expression strain did not decrease with the increase of SAC-B concentration, compared with the control strain containing vector pET28a (Fig.\\xa02F). These collective results unambiguously supported that SacH, the DHFR-like protein, endows host cells resistance to SAC-B for self-protection via reductive inactivation of not only the end-product but also the hemiaminal pharmacophore-containing biosynthetic intermediate.",
