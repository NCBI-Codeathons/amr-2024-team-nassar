       "['Bacterial strains and growth conditions. The strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table\\xa0S2. Streptomyces strains were grown at 30°C on solid MS medium (59) (mannitol soya flour medium), DNA (2.3% Difco nutrient agar), and MH agar (1.5% agar in Mueller-Hinton broth, purchased from Oxoid) or in liquid YPM2 (0.4% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 1% malt extract [pH 7.2]) or AVM (60) media. The spore suspensions of S. lincolnensis were prepared and germinated for 3 h in 2×\\u2009GM (1% yeast extract, 1% Casamino Acids, 0.01 M CaCl2), and the spore suspensions of S. coelicolor were germinated for 6 h in 2× YT (1.6% Bacto tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) according to protocols published in Practical Streptomyces Genetics (61). For the selection of exconjugants, antibiotics were added to the cultivation media at the following concentrations: apramycin, 50\\u2009mg liter−1; kanamycin, 50\\u2009mg liter−1; carbenicillin, 100\\u2009mg liter−1; chloramphenicol, 25\\u2009mg liter−1; nalidixic acid, 25\\u2009mg liter−1; and hygromycin at 100\\u2009mg liter−1 (E. coli) or 40\\u2009mg liter−1 (Streptomyces) in agar plates or at 80\\u2009mg liter−1 (E. coli) or 40\\u2009mg liter−1 (Streptomyces) in liquid media. Statistics for proteomics data (Fig.\\xa03a; see also Fig.\\xa0S4a). Download Table\\xa0S2, XLSX file, 0.03 MB. (i) For antibiotic production, proteomic analysis and RT-PCR, S. lincolnensis and its derived mutants or S. caelestis spores were germinated and inoculated into 50\\u2009ml of YPM2 (to reach optical density at 450 nm [OD450] 0.03) in 250-ml baffled flasks and cultivated on an orbital shaker for 40 to 42 h at 30°C and 200\\u2009rpm. A total of 2.5\\u2009ml of the YPM2 seed culture was used to inoculate 47.5\\u2009ml of fresh AVM broth (60), followed by cultivation in 250-ml baffled flasks for 120 h at 30°C and 200\\u2009rpm (see Fig.\\xa0S7b). (ii) For the qPCR analyses and Western blot analyses of S. lincolnensis, spores were germinated, inoculated into 50-ml Falcon tubes containing 20\\u2009ml of YPM2 media (to reach OD450 0.03), and grown on an orbital shaker (8 h, 30°C, 200\\u2009rpm) prior to induction. The cultures were then induced with the antibiotic indicated, and the cultivation continued for an additional 8 h (see Fig.\\xa0S7b). (iii) For the Western blot analysis of S. coelicolor, spores were germinated, transferred into 50\\u2009ml of YEME (0.3% yeast extract, 0.05% peptone, 0.03% malt extract, 1% glucose, 34% sucrose, 5\\u2009mM MgCl2) in 250-ml flasks with springs, and cultivated on an orbital shaker for 48 h at 30°C and 200\\u2009rpm. The cultures were then induced with clindamycin (0.03\\u2009mg/liter) and cultivated for 2 h (see Fig.\\xa0S7c). Construction of knockout strains. The S. lincolnensis ΔA (BN3024), S. lincolnensis ΔB (BN3002), and S. lincolnensis ΔC (BN3001) mutants were constructed by replacing the entire coding sequence of the target gene with a cassette (773 or 775 [62]) carrying the apramycin resistance gene [aac(3)IV] and oriT of RK2 using the PCR-targeting method (63). Oligonucleotides used for gene deletion and verification of the deletion are listed in Table\\xa0S2. PCR targeting was applied to the cosmid LK6 (23), which contained the entire lincomycin biosynthetic cluster. After conjugation of mutated cosmids into S. lincolnensis, kanamycin-sensitive (Kans) and apramycin-resistant (Aprr) double-crossover mutants with target genes replaced by the aac(3)IV-oriT cassette were confirmed by PCR amplification. For the construction of S. lincolnensis ΔAB (BN3021), S. lincolnensis ΔAC (BN3018), and S. lincolnensis ΔBC (BN3008) double mutants, the inactivation cassettes 773 in S. lincolnensis ΔB (BN3002) and S. lincolnensis ΔC (BN3001) single mutants were replaced by an unmarked in-frame deletion obtained by FLP-mediated excision of the disruption cassette (62). The second gene to be deleted was replaced with cassette 775 according to the same protocol as used for single-knockout strains. Knockout strains were verified by PCR and Southern blot analysis. The scheme of the orientation of inactivation cassettes in all knockout strains is available in Fig.\\xa0S1. Construction of vectors for natural, constitutive, or inducible expression. Details on the preparation of vectors and oligonucleotides used are listed in Table\\xa0S2. The vectors An (bearing lmrA with its 1,330-bp upstream sequence), Bn (bearing lmrB gene with an 86-bp upstream region), and Cn (bearing lmrC gene and its 1,281-bp upstream region) were used to express resistance genes under its natural promoter. For constitutive expression, lmrA, lmrB, and lmrC were PCR amplified from ligated under the ermEp promoter of pIJ10257 (64), yielding plasmids AC, BC, and CC. For the coexpression of lmrA or lmrB with lmrC in the heterologous host, lmrC with the ermEp promoter was cloned into PtipA expression vector pIJ6902 (65) (construct Cc2). All the above-mentioned vectors were prepared by restriction enzyme cloning. Constructs CC-mCh, C-U-mCh, U-mCh, UC-mCh, 5′C-mCh, and C-mCh were prepared by using the SLICE cloning method (66) (for details, see Table\\xa0S2). Inducible expression in vectors Ci and CEQ12i were achieved by introducing the theophylline-dependent riboswitch (67) via the whole plasmid PCR (details in Table\\xa0S2). All the constructs described were verified by sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis. To introduce mutations, the QuikChange protocol (Agilent) was used. In plasmid CEQ12, for expression of the lmrCEQ12 mutant, two mutations were introduced into the lmrC coding sequence: glutamate 167 was replaced with a codon for glutamine, and the parallel codon for glutamate 495 was replaced with a codon for glutamine. To test the putative terminator structure, a series of G-to-C and C-to-G point mutations were introduced into the lmrC upstream region in C-mCh vector, yielding plasmids pGBN120, pGBN121, and pGBN124. To test the function of uORFs 1 to 4, their START codons were mutated in C-mCh, yielding plasmids pGBN070 (uORF 1), pGBN106 (uORF 2), pGBN117 (uORF 3), and pGBN119 (uORF 4). All used oligonucleotides are listed in Table\\xa0S2. All the constructs described were verified by sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility tests. The MIC values were determined on MH agar with a serial 2-fold dilution of antibiotics. Frozen spores (see Fig.\\xa0S7a) or mycelia from 42-h seed culture or 120-h production culture (see Fig.\\xa0S7b) were diluted in 2\\u2009ml of sterile water to optical density OD450 0.2 to 0.3, and 5\\u2009μl was spotted on MH agar with antibiotic and incubated at 30°C for 5\\u2009days. Extraction of lincomycin and celesticetin. A total of 1\\u2009ml of supernatant from 42-h seed culture or 160-h production culture (see Fig.\\xa0S7b) was used for solid-phase extraction as follows: an Oasis HLB 3-ml 60-mg cartridge (hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced sorbent; Waters, USA) was conditioned with 3\\u2009ml of methanol and equilibrated with 3\\u2009ml of water, and then 1\\u2009ml of the supernatant of cultivation broth (for lincomycin extraction pH adjusted to 9.0 with ammonium hydroxide) was loaded. The cartridge was washed with 3\\u2009ml of water, and absorbed substances were eluted with 1.5\\u2009ml of 80% methanol. The eluent was evaporated to dryness, reconstituted in 150\\u2009μl of 50% methanol, and centrifuged at 12,045\\u2009×\\u2009g for 5\\u2009min at room temperature. The extract was then diluted 10× with methanol-water (1:1 [vol/vol]) and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), as described below. LC-MS analysis of lincomycin and celesticetin. LC analyses of the samples depicted in Fig.\\xa01 and in Fig.\\xa03a were performed on an Acquity UPLC system equipped with a 2996 DAD detector and LCT premier XE time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters). Five microliters of each sample was loaded onto an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 LC column (50\\u2009mm\\u2009×\\u20092.1\\u2009mm, inner diameter [ID]; particle size, 1.7\\u2009μm; Waters) kept at 40°C and eluted with a two-component mobile phase. For phases A and B, the A solution was 1\\u2009mM ammonium formate (pH 9) for lincomycin detection (prepared by titration of formic acid 98 to 100% [Merck, Germany] with ammonium hydroxide 28 to 30% [Sigma-Aldrich, Germany]), the A solution was 0.1% formic acid for celesticetin detection, and the B solution was acetonitrile (LC-MS grade; Biosolve, Netherlands). The analyses were performed with a linear gradient program (min/%B): 0/5, 1.5/5, and 12.5/58, followed by a 1.5-min column cleanup (100% B) and 1.5-min equilibration (5% B) at a flow rate of 0.4\\u2009ml min−1. The DAD detector monitored the column effluent in the range 194 to 600\\u2009nm; the mass spectrometer operated in the “W” mode with its capillary voltage set at +2,800 V, its cone voltage at +40\\u2009V, its desolvation gas temperature at 350°C, an ion source block temperature at 120°C, cone gas flow at 50 liters h−1, desolvation gas flow at 800\\u2009liters h−1, a scan time at 0.15\\u2009s, and an interscan delay at 0.01\\u2009s. The data were processed by MassLynx V4.1 (Waters). UV chromatograms monitored at 194\\u2009nm were used for lincomycin quantitation based on a five-point linear calibration curve, which was constructed from peak areas corresponding to lincomycin. Calibration solutions were prepared by spiking lincomycin authentic standard at the required concentration into lincomycin-free cultivation broth, extracted and preconcentrated as described above. The quantitation parameters were as follows: concentrations used for the calibration curve were 3.78, 7.56, 15.125, 31.250, 62.5, and 125\\u2009mg liter−1, the correlation coefficient was r2\\u2009=\\u20090.995, and the limit of quantification was 7.56\\u2009mg liter−1 (determined as the lowest point of the calibration curve with precision within 10%). Samples from 42 h of cultivation with lincomycin concentrations below the limit of quantitation were examined by MS detection: extracted ion chromatograms at m/z 407.2 were evaluated for the presence of lincomycin. The 160-h samples for celesticetin production were also examined using MS detection: extracted ion chromatograms at m/z 528.6 were evaluated for the presence of celesticetin. The LC-MS analyses depicted in Fig.\\xa02b and Fig.\\xa0S2 were performed on a 6546 LC/Q-TOF (Agilent Technologies, USA) connected to a 1290 Infinity II LC system. One microliter of the sample was loaded on a UPLC CSH C18 Premier column (100\\u2009mm\\u2009×\\u20092.1\\u2009mm, ID; particle size, 1.7\\u2009μm) kept at 30°C. The analytes were eluted at a flow rate of 0.4\\u2009ml min−1 with a two-component mobile phase consisting of 1\\u2009mM ammonium formate (pH 9) (A) and acetonitrile (B) using a linear gradient program min/%B: 0/5, 1.5/5, 15/65, 15.1/100, 16/100, 16.1/5, and 17.5/5. The mass spectrometer operated in ESI+ mode (jet stream technology) with the following settings: capillary voltage, 3,500 V; nozzle voltage, 200 V; gas temperature, 250°C; drying gas, 8 liters min−1; nebulizer, 35 lb/in2; sheath gas temperature, 400°C; sheath gas flow, 12 liters min−1; fragmentor, 140 V; and skimmer, 65 V. The ions of m/z 80 to 1,200 were monitored with scan rates of 4 spectra s−1 and 250\\u2009ms/spectrum. The identity of the analytes was confirmed by the comparison of retention times with an authentic standard, accurate mass, and collision-induced dissociation fragmentation at a collision energy of 20\\u2009eV. The data were processed using Quantitative 10.1 software within a MassHunter workstation (Agilent). Lincomycin quantitation was performed using a standard calibration curve of the lincomycin standard (2-fold serial dilutions from 0.0097 to 40\\u2009mg liter−1) dissolved in the solid-phase extract of a lincomycin nonproducing Streptomyces lincolnensis\\nlmbD deletion mutant strain. The LLOQ (lower limit of quantification) was determined as the lowest analyte concentration determined with sufficient precision (relative standard deviation of 20%) and accuracy (80 to 120%) using a calibration curve with its lowest point being equal to LLOQ. Protein digestion for proteomic analysis. Mycelia (0.1 g) of 40-h seed culture inoculated from fresh spores (see Fig.\\xa0S7b) were lysed in 0.5\\u2009ml of 100\\u2009mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 2% sodium deoxycholate, 10\\u2009mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 40\\u2009mM chloroacetamide and boiled at 95°C for 5\\u2009min. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo), and 20\\u2009μg of protein per sample was used for MS sample preparation. Samples were digested with trypsin (at a trypsin/protein ratio of 1/20) at 37°C overnight. After digestion, the samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 1%. Sodium deoxycholate was removed by extraction to ethyl acetate (68), and peptides were desalted on a Michrom C18 column. nLC-MS2 analysis. Nanoreversed-phase columns (EASY-Spray column, 50\\u2009cm by 75\\u2009μm, ID; PepMap C18; 2-μm particles, 100-Å pore size) were used for LC-MS analysis. Mobile-phase buffer A was composed of water and 0.1% formic acid. Mobile-phase buffer B was composed of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Samples were loaded onto the trap column (Acclaim PepMap300; C18, 5\\u2009μm; 300-Å Wide Pore; 300\\u2009μm × 5\\u2009mm; five cartridges) for 4\\u2009min at 17.5\\u2009μl min−1 loading buffer composed of water, 2% acetonitrile, and 0.1% TFA. Peptides were eluted with a mobile-phase B gradient from 4 to 35% B in 60\\u2009min. Eluting peptide cations were converted to gas-phase ions by electrospray ionization and analyzed on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion (Q-OT-qIT; Thermo). Survey scans of peptide precursors from 350 to 1,400 m/z were performed at 120 K resolution (at 200 m/z) with a 5\\u2009×\\u2009105 ion count target. Tandem MS was performed by isolation at 1.5 m/z with the quadrupole, higher-energy C-trap dissociation fragmentation with a normalized collision energy of 30, and rapid scan MS analysis in the ion trap. The MS2 ion count target was set to 104, and the maximum injection time was 35\\u2009ms. Only those precursors with charge states of 2 to 6 were sampled for MS2. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to 45 s with a 10-ppm tolerance around the selected precursor and its isotopes. Monoisotopic precursor selection was turned on. The instrument was run in the top speed mode with 2-s cycles (69). Proteomic data analysis and interpretation. All data were analyzed and quantified with MaxQuant software (version 1.6.1.0) (70). The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% for both proteins and peptides, and we specified a minimum peptide length of seven amino acids. The Andromeda search engine was used for the MS/MS spectra search against the Streptomyces lincolnensis database (downloaded from the NCBI on July 2018). Enzyme specificity was set with the C terminus as Arg and Lys, also allowing cleavage at proline bonds and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was selected as a fixed modification, and N-terminal protein acetylation and methionine oxidation were selected as variable modifications. The “match between runs” feature of MaxQuant was used to transfer identifications to other LC-MS/MS runs based on their masses and retention time (maximum deviation, 0.7\\u2009min), and this was also used in quantification experiments. Quantifications were performed with the label-free algorithms described recently. The obtained normalized data were imported to Perseus 1.6.1.3 software (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Munich, Germany) (71). All numeric values corresponding to protein intensity were transformed to a logarithmic scale, and all samples were grouped using categorical annotation. Missing values were then replaced by random numbers drawn from a normal distribution of 1.8 standard deviations (SD) downshift and with a width of 0.3 of each sample. Heat maps of the relative abundance of selected proteins were generated from the matrix of protein intensities without imputation of missing values in Microsoft Excel. Proteomic analysis at 40 h was assessed in five biological (four for ΔC without clindamycin) replicates for each sample/treatment. RT-PCR. Mycelia from 16-h seed cultures were uninduced or induced by clindamycin (0.5\\u2009mg liter−1) (see Fig.\\xa0S7c), and 5-ml portions the culture were harvested by centrifugation (4,000\\u2009×\\u2009g, 15\\u2009min, 4°C) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the analysis, samples were defrosted and incubated in 1\\u2009ml of RNAprotect cell reagent (Qiagen; 5\\u2009min, 25°C). Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged (4,000\\u2009×\\u2009g, 15\\u2009min, 4°C), and the pellet was resuspended in 250\\u2009μl of TE buffer. The suspension was mixed with glass beads (0.1-mm diameter) in a 2:1 ratio and disrupted using a Fast-Prep (MP Biomedicals) program for 1\\u2009×\\u200960 s at a speed of 6\\u2009ms−1. Immediately after cell lysis, total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (T9424, 100\\u2009ml; Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated total RNA, resuspended in 100\\u2009μl of water, was treated with Turbo DNase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by an additional step of total RNA isolation using TRI Reagent. The integrity of RNA was controlled by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The purity and concentration of RNA were controlled by using NanoDrop.cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. One microliter of reverse transcription reaction mix or total RNA was added to 20\\u2009μl of PCR mix using the primers indicated (sequences in Table\\xa0S2). PCR was performed using Taq-Purple DNA polymerase (T107). The following PCR program was used: 96°C for 1\\u2009min, followed by 30 cycles of 96°C for 10 s, 55°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 1\\u2009min. Quantitative RT-PCR. The 16-h clindamycin-induced and uninduced seed cultures were cultivated and incubated in 1\\u2009ml of Protect RNA in the same manner as for RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). The isolated RNA was treated with DNase I (0.1 U μl−1, 30\\u2009min, 37°C) and repurified with an RNeasy RNA isolation kit. The RNA quantity and quality were checked with a NanoDrop instrument (DeNovix). The RNA quantities were normalized to the lowest concentration of RNA in the samples. The quantities of lmrC, lmbU, lmbN, and 16S rRNA transcripts were measured by one-step qRT-PCR (SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit) using the following oligonucleotides (10\\u2009μM): lmrCf+lmrCr, lmbUf+lmbUr, lmbNf+lmbNr, and 16SrRNAf+16SrRNAr. The following real-time PCR program was used: 60°C for 3\\u2009min, 95°C for 5\\u2009min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 65°C (lmbU, lmbN, and 16S rRNA) or 63°C (lmrC) for 20 s. CT values of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN transcripts, based on the standard curves, were normalized to CT values of 16S rRNA. The relative expression was calculated as 2–ΔCT. Western blotting and immunodetection. For S. lincolnensis, 20-ml seed cultures inoculated with germinated spores were induced with lincomycin (4\\u2009mg liter−1), clindamycin (0.5\\u2009mg liter−1), pristinamycin IIA (4\\u2009mg liter−1), tiamulin (0.125\\u2009mg liter−1), erythromycin (0.5\\u2009mg liter−1), pristinamycin IA (4\\u2009mg liter−1), chloramphenicol (4\\u2009mg liter−1), and carbenicillin (4\\u2009mg liter−1) at 8 h, and cultivation continued until the indicated time points (see Fig.\\xa0S7c). Mycelia were harvested by centrifugation (10\\u2009min, 4°C, 4,000\\u2009×\\u2009g), washed with buffer 1 (50\\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 150\\u2009mM NaCl [pH 8.0]) and resuspended in sonication buffer (50\\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]; pH 8.0). After sonication (3\\u2009×\\u200940 s; UP200S Hielscher Ultrasonic GmbH), cell lysates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue to test the load of whole protein volume. Next, 8% SDS-PAGE with adjusted whole protein volumes was run, and samples were Western blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (semidry transfer, 15 V, 45\\u2009min, Trans-blot; Bio-Rad). A control SDS-PAGE was run in parallel. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking solution 5% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker (Bio-Rad) in PBS-Tween buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), followed by incubation for an additional 1 h with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-LmrC or rabbit polyclonal anti-mCherry antibody) diluted 1:5,000 in 1% (wt/vol) nonfat dried milk in PBS-Tween buffer. Membranes were washed for three times for\\u200915\\u2009min each time in PBS-Tween buffer, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG 1:2,000 in 1% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker in PBS-Tween buffer, and washed three times for\\u200915\\u2009min each time in PBS-Tween buffer. Antibody complexes were detected using Immobilon Western HRP substrate (Merck) on a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). For S. coelicolor, the method was adapted as follows: 50-ml seed cultures inoculated with germinated spores were induced with clindamycin (0.03\\u2009mg liter−1) at 24 h, and cultivation continued for 2 h. Mycelia were harvested by centrifugation (10\\u2009min, 4°C, 4,000\\u2009×\\u2009g) and resuspended in lysis buffer (50\\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche], 1% SDS [pH 8.0]). After lysis on Fast prep (four times for 20 s each time, with 4-min pauses on ice), cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (wet transfer, 30 V, 0.09\\u2009mA, 18 h). The membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking solution composed of 5% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker (Bio-Rad) in PBS-Tween buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) and for 1 h with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-mCherry antibody [Invitrogen] or mouse polyclonal anti-mCherry antibody [AB Clonal]) diluted 1:5,000 in 1% (wt/vol) nonfat dried milk in PBS-Tween buffer. Membranes were washed three times for\\u200915\\u2009min each time in PBS-Tween buffer, incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated monoclonal anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG 1:2,000 in 1% (wt/vol) Blotting-Grade Blocker in PBS-Tween buffer, and washed three times for\\u200915\\u2009min each time in PBS-Tween buffer. Antibody complexes were detected using Immobilon Western HRP substrate (Merck) on a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). After immunodetection, the membrane was washed with PBS-Tween buffer and then stained with 0.1% Coomassie R-250 in methanol/water (1:1) for 5\\u2009min, destained twice for\\u200910\\u2009min each time in acetic acid-ethanol-water (1:5:4), washed with water, and air dried. The dry membrane was recorded on ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad) at 600\\u2009dpi, and the staining density for each complete lane was analyzed in ImageLab (Bio-Rad) or ImageJ software with an area outside the protein lanes defining the background. The signal intensities were normalized to the signal intensity of the induced BN3038 strain (for S. coelicolor) or BN3511 (for S. lincolnensis) transferred to the same membrane. Statistical analysis. The MIC, Western blot, and qRT-PCR results are expressed as the means ± the SD.

       " 'Validation of the lexQSABC operon by RT-PCR. L. antibioticus strain OH13 was grown at 28°C overnight in nutrient broth (3 g beef extract, 1 g yeast extract, 5 g tryptone, 10 g sucrose [pH = 7.0 to 7.2] in 1 liter distilled water) as seed culture. Then, a 1% (vol/vol) seed culture was transferred to a 1/10 dilution of tryptic soy broth (TSB). L. antibioticus OH13 cells were immediately harvested at an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1.0 via centrifugation at 4,000\\u2009rpm for 10\\u2009min. Total RNA was extracted using a bacterial RNA extraction kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA) and quantified using an Eppendorf BioPhotometer Plus. Subsequently, Vazyme HiScript II Q RT SuperMix was used to eliminate gDNA and produce cDNA from 250\\u2009ng of RNA. Specific primers for each fragment are provided in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Standard PCR used TransTaq-T DNA polymerase with cDNA as the template, RNA and H2O as the negative control, and gDNA as the positive control. Purification of LexR and mutants. The gene lexR was amplified from gDNA of OH13 with primers lexR-PF and lexR-PR (Table S1). The PCR product was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into plasmid pET-28a to obtain a pET-lexR construct. The lexR sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression construct pET-lexR was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). The BL21-pET-lexR overnight culture was transferred to 100\\u2009mL LB medium containing kanamycin (25\\u2009μg/mL) and grown until an OD600 of 0.6. Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.5\\u2009mM, and cells were cultured at 37°C for an additional 6\\u2009h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20\\u2009mL buffer (50\\u2009mM Tris-Cl, 300\\u2009mM NaCl; pH 7.9) and then lysed ultrasonically on ice. The supernatant was then loaded onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column previously calibrated with 5\\u2009mM imidazole buffer. His6-tagged LexR protein (53.1\\u2009kDa) was purified using an imidazole step gradient and detected with SDS-PAGE. Protein with His6 tag was concentrated and measured with Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad) and then used in EMSAs. Residue mutants LexR-V146A, LexR-K195A, and LexR-V146A-K195A were obtained using the appropriate mutant genes in the purification scheme. The site mutation for LexR was constructed through direct gene synthesis. EMSA. The promoter region of the lexQSABC operon was predicted with the online tool BPROM (http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=bprom&group=programs&subgroup=gfindb). A 165-bp DNA fragment containing the lexQSABC promoter region and a 158-bp promoter region from another RND efflux pump operon as control were amplified via PCR with 5′-end biotin-labeled primers. We also synthesized four pairs of complementary oligonucleotide 5′-end biotin-labeled primers. Primers were mixed with 1× annealing buffer (10× annealing buffer; 100\\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, 0.1\\u2009mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) and annealed at 95°C for 5\\u2009min. The products were kept at room temperature for 2\\u2009h, and subsequently we obtained the probes. Probe 1 was a 58-bp sequence from the lexQSABC promoter, and probe 2 was a 50-bp sequence without the putative binding site of LexR. Probe 3 was a 58-bp sequence from the 158-bp control probe, and probe 4 was a 58-bp sequence replacing the putative binding site of LexR to probe 3. The sequences of probes are shown in the supplemental material. EMSA was conducted using LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kits (Thermo Scientific). The manufacturer’s instructions were followed for the EMSA, with binding reaction mixtures (20\\u2009μL) containing 1× binding buffer, 50\\u2009ng/μL poly(dI-dC), 2.5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 5\\u2009mM MgCl, 0.05% (vol/vol) NP-40, 5\\u2009fmol labeled probe, and different concentrations of LexR and myxin as required. Reactions were continued for 30\\u2009min at room temperature, and subsequent steps were completed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Chemiluminescence signals of biotin-labeled probes were captured using a Tanon 4600 imaging system (China). The primers are listed in Table S1. SPR analysis. The binding affinity of myxin for LexR and its mutants was investigated via SPR using a bScreen LB 991 label-free microarray system (Berthold Technologies, Germany). Myxin was immobilized on photo cross-linker SPRi sensor chips, and LexR and mutant proteins were diluted separately with running buffer phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST; pH 7.4) at concentrations of 10, 40, 160, 640, and 2,560\\u2009nM. The injection time was >600 s at a flow rate of 0.5\\u2009μL/s for each successive stage. Chips were then washed with running buffer for 360 s at a flow rate of 0.5\\u2009μL/s in each dissociation stage. Chip surfaces were regenerated to remove any remaining bound material with a pulse of 10\\u2009mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) at 20\\u2009μL/min for 300 s at the end of each association-dissociation cycle. Complementation and site-directed mutation of LexR. For complementation of lexR, the target gene was amplified with primers lexR-CF and lexR-CR and then cloned into the plasmid pBBR1-MCS5. To construct the LexR site-directed mutants V146A or K195A, two sequences were obtained with primers (pBBR-lexR-F/146-1-R and 146-2-F/pBBR-lexR-R for V146A, pBBR-lexR-F/195-1-R and 195-2-F/pBBR-lexR-R for K195A), and then assembled with the plasmid pBBR1-MCS5. The expression constructs were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing and subsequently introduced into lexR deletion mutants by electroporation. The resultant strains were validated by PCR. The primers are listed in Table S1. qRT-PCR. Bacterial cells were cultured in 1/10 TSB and collected at an OD600 of ~1.0. RNA extraction was carried out with a bacterial RNA extraction kit (Yeasen MolPure, China). The concentration and quality of RNA were detected with an Eppendorf BioPhotometer Plus. cDNA synthesis was performed with 250\\u2009ng of RNA using a kit (Vazyme HiScript II Q RT SuperMix with gDNA wiper). Primers for qRT-PCR designed with primer 3 online are shown in Table S1, and the 16S rRNA gene was used as a reference. The qRT-PCRs was performed on a Quantstudio 6 Flex system (Applied Biosystems) using ChamQ SYBR qPCR master mix (Vazyme). The experiment was repeated three times, each time in triplicate. Relative expression was analyzed using the threshold cycle (2−ΔΔCT) method.',\n",
       " 'Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively, in the supplemental material. To harvest Streptomyces spores, Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 and its derivatives, S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and its derivatives, and S. coelicolor M1146 were grown at 28°C on International Streptomyces Project (ISP) medium 3 agar (44), glucose-yeast extract-malt extract (GYM) agar (25), and MS (2% mannitol, 2% soya flour) agar, respectively. E. coli strains for nucleic acid manipulation were cultured at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. When necessary, antibiotics were added at the following final concentrations: 100\\u2009μg/mL ampicillin, 50\\u2009μg/mL apramycin or kanamycin, and 25\\u2009μg/mL chloramphenicol for E. coli and 25\\u2009μg/mL apramycin, kanamycin, or nalidixic acid for Streptomyces. Construction of gene disruption and complementation mutants. Nucleic acid manipulations were performed using standard procedures for E. coli (45) and Streptomyces (46) and according to the instructions of the manufacturers of the restriction enzymes and kits. The lasalocid BGC sequences and genome sequences of Streptomyces were obtained from the NCBI GenBank database. The Streptomyces mutant strains were constructed from wild-type strains by gene replacement via homologous recombination as previously described (26, 47). For the genetic complementation of lodR1, a DNA fragment carrying the lodR1 ORF was amplified by PCR using primers lodR1-orf-F and lodR1-orf-R (Table S3). The PCR product was gel purified and then ligated with EcoRV-digested pSET152 and a strong constitutive promoter, PkasO*, by Gibson assembly to give plasmid pSET152::PkasO*lodR1C. The recombinant plasmid was subsequently introduced into the lodR1 mutant (ΔlodR1) via conjugation to generate the ΔlodR1C complemented strain. Other complemented strains and heterologous-expression strains were constructed similarly. The primers used in this study are listed in Table S3. Analysis of lasalocid production and bacterial biomass. For lasalocid production, a suitable number of spores (~2.5\\u2009×\\u2009106) of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172-WT, wild-type S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T, or their mutants was inoculated into a 50-mL centrifuge tube containing 10\\u2009mL of liquid tryptic soy broth (TSB) (pancreatic digest of 1.7% casein and papaic digest of 0.3% soybean, 0.25% dextrose, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.25% K2HPO4 [pH 7.1 to 7.5]) and incubated on a rotary shaker at 220\\u2009rpm at 28°C for 48\\u2009h as a seed culture. Next, 1\\u2009mL of the seed culture was transferred into 50\\u2009mL of liquid SSC (2% soluble starch, 1% soybean powder, 0.5% calcium carbonate) medium. The cultures were incubated for different numbers of days at 28°C before sampling. For the analysis of lasalocid, 50\\u2009mL of fermentation broth was centrifuged at 5,000\\u2009rpm for 15\\u2009min to separate the mycelia and the supernatant. The mycelia were extracted with 50\\u2009mL of ethanol, and the supernatant was extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The extracts were combined and concentrated in vacuo to evaporate the solvent, and the residue was redissolved in 1.5\\u2009mL of methanol (MeOH) for analysis. HPLC analysis was performed on a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system using a Waters Xbridge octyl decyl silane column with a linear gradient of MeOH-H2O at a flow rate of 1.0\\u2009mL/min. Mobile phases consisted of A: MeOH; and B: H2O. The following program was used to elute the column: 0 min, 20% A; 15 min, 100% A; 20.5 min, 100% A; 20.51 min, 20% A; 26.5 min 20% A. The effluent was monitored at 316\\u2009nm. Tandem mass spectrometry identification of lasalocid was performed as previously described (26). The lasalocid A standard was used as a positive control for HPLC and mass spectrometry analyses to confirm the production of lasalocid (Fig. S6). The bacterial biomass was determined by measuring the cell dry weight. An aliquot of 2\\u2009mL of the cell culture was harvested and centrifuged at 12,000\\u2009rpm for 10\\u2009min to separate the mycelia and the supernatant, and the mycelia were then dried at 50°C to a constant weight. RNA isolation and transcriptional analyses. Total RNAs were isolated from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 and its derivatives after incubation for 72, 96, and 120\\u2009h in SSC medium as described previously (48). Likewise, total RNAs were isolated from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and its derivatives after incubation for 120 and 144\\u2009h in SSC medium. First-strand synthesis of cDNA was carried out with a Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, CA, USA) using 1\\u2009μg of total RNA in a total volume of 20\\u2009μL according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cotranscriptional analysis was performed by RT-PCR according to previously reported procedures (49) to ascertain the transcriptional units of lod and las. Subsequent RT-qPCR of selected genes was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 10\\u2009pmol of each primer and 1\\u2009μL of cDNA in a total volume of 20\\u2009μL. RT-qPCR was also conducted without reverse transcriptase to test DNA contamination in the RNA. The 16S rRNA gene was used as an internal control to normalize the RNA concentration. Primers used for transcriptional analyses are listed in Table S3. Expression and purification of LodR1-His6, LodR2-His6, and Las3-His6 proteins. The lodR1, lodR2, lodR3, and las3 coding regions were amplified using primer pairs lodR1-orf-F/lodR1-orf-R, lodR2-orf-F/lodR2-orf-R, lodR3-orf-F/lodR3-orf-R, and las3-orf-F/las3-orf-R (Table S3), respectively. The amplified fragments were digested with NdeI and XhoI and then inserted into the same sites of pET23b or pET28a to generate the expression plasmids. The recombinant plasmids were confirmed by sequencing and subsequently introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The transformants were grown in LB medium with 100\\u2009μg/mL ampicillin at 37°C to an optical density at 600\\u2009nm (OD600) of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1\\u2009mM, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 16\\u2009h at 28°C. The recombinant proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose chromatography according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Novagen). Protein purity was determined by Coomassie blue staining after SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The concentration of protein was determined according to the protocol of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Novagen). The purified proteins were stored at 4°C. EMSAs and DNase I footprinting. EMSAs were performed mainly as previously described (50). DNA probes covering the intergenic regions were amplified using primer pairs listed in Table S3. The probe (10\\u2009ng) was incubated individually with various quantities of the recombinant proteins at 25°C for 25\\u2009min in a buffer containing 20\\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1\\u2009mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10\\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.5\\u2009μg/μL calf bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 5% (vol/vol) glycerol in a total volume of 20\\u2009μL. After incubation, protein-bound and free DNAs were separated by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 4.5% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with SYBR gold (Invitrogen), and the images were captured by a Bio-Rad GelDoc 2000 system. DNase I footprinting assays were performed as previously described (51), with slight modifications. To determine the LodR1- and LodR2-binding sites, 32P-labeled probes PR1–A and PR2–E were amplified by PCR with the labeled primers (Table S3). The footprinting reaction mixture contained 30,000\\u2009cpm of the 32P-labeled DNA probe, 0.2 to 1\\u2009μM LodR1-His6 or LodR2-His6, and 2.5\\u2009μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) in 50\\u2009μL of EMSA buffer. After incubation at 25°C for 25\\u2009min, 5.5\\u2009μL RQ1 RNase-free DNase buffer and 0.2\\u2009U DNase I were added to the above-described reaction mixture, followed by further incubation at 25°C for 70\\u2009s. Next, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50\\u2009μL of stop solution (20\\u2009mM EGTA, pH 8.0) and 100\\u2009μL of phenol-CH3Cl (1:1, vol/vol) to the mixture. DNA fragments in the mixture were precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of isopropanol, and the pellet was washed with 75% (vol/vol) ethanol. The samples were resuspended, denatured, and electrophoretically fractionated according to previously described procedures (51). The sequencing ladder was made using the Silver Sequence DNA sequencing system (Promega, USA). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-ray film. To determine the Las3-binding sites on Plas2–3, the DNA probe was amplified by PCR with 5′-fluorescein amidite (FAM)-labeled primer pairs. Different concentrations of Las3-His6 and 400\\u2009ng of the labeled DNA probe were incubated in EMSA buffer for 25\\u2009min at 25°C. Next, samples were digested by DNase I (Promega) at 25°C for 45\\u2009s, and digestion was terminated with 20\\u2009mM EGTA. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the resulting DNA samples were subsequently loaded onto an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA analyzer. GeneMarker v2.2.0 software was used to analyze the DNA regions protected by Las3. gusA transcriptional fusion assays. The gusA reporter system was constructed as previously described (33). Briefly, the putative promoter region from lod was inserted into the upstream region of a promoterless gusA gene to generate pIJ10500::Px-gusA plasmids (Px represents the promoters of the lod genes tested). The authenticity of each recombinant plasmid was confirmed by subsequent sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into S. coelicolor M1146 via E. coli-Streptomyces conjugal transfer and integrated into the Streptomyces chromosome at the ΦBT1 attB site. The resultant S. coelicolor M1146 derivative strains were used as negative controls in β-glucuronidase (GUS) assays and as conjugation recipients for the overexpression of lodR3. Subsequently, pSET152::PkasO*lodR3C containing lodR3 driven by PkasO* was introduced into the M1146 derivatives in which gusA was controlled by different promoters of lod genes. The resultant strains were cultured on AS-1 (0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% soluble starch, 0.25% NaCl, 1% Na2SO4, 0.02% l-Ala, 0.02% l-Arg, 0.05% l-Asn) agar with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide (X-Gluc) at a final concentration of 100\\u2009μM at 28°C for 72\\u2009h to observe the chromogenic reaction. Statistical analysis. For each gene disruption, at least three individual mutants were tested. Other experiments were performed at least in biological triplicate unless otherwise stated, and the data are presented as means ± standard deviations (SD). Statistical significance was analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.',\n",

Ptet constructs were induced by adding anhydrotetracycline (aTc) at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/mL. The Para ETγA (full-length recE, recT, redγ, and recA) and Para γβαA (redγ, redβ, redα, and recA) operons were induced by adding 10% l-arabinose. Plac constructs were induced by adding IPTG at a final concentration of 0.2\\u2009mM. We added 100\\u2009μg/mL of diaminopimelic acid (DAP) to cultures of the E. coli WM3064 strain, which is auxotrophic for this amino acid. Strains and plasmids used in this study.

Download Table\\xa0S2, PDF file, 0.1 MB. Recombineering construction of p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC-mob. As previously described by Fu et al. (29), genomic DNA from X. nematophila was first digested with NcoI and SphI to generate a 45.2-kb fragment containing the odl-BGC locus and surrounding genes. Homology arms were ordered as oligonucleotides and attached by p15A-cm PCR with pACYC184 as a template. One homology arm started at the start codon of the first gene cloned (ectB gene) and extended 80\\u2009bp downstream. The other homology arm started at the SphI site and extended 80\\u2009bp upstream. After linear-plus-linear homologous recombination by RecET in GB05-dir activated with arabinose (0.3%), the odl locus was inserted directly into the p15A vector to create the p15A-odl-BGC containing a 44.5-kb odl-BGC fragment (four odl genes plus the surrounding genes). For expression of the odl-BGC locus, homology arms were ordered as oligonucleotides and attached to the Kmr-Tetr-PLtetO1 fragment of pSC101. One homology arm started at the start codon of the ectB gene and extended 57\\u2009bp downstream. The other homology arm started 216 bases from the p15A origin and extended 52\\u2009bp upstream. After linear-plus-circular homologous recombination by Redαβ in GB08-red activated with arabinose (0.3%), the Kmr-Tetr-PLtetO1 fragment was inserted into the p15A-odl-BGC plasmid between the p15A origin and the start codon of the ectB gene, to create p15A- Ptet-odl-BGC containing the 44.5-kb odl-BGC fragment under the control of the PLtetO1 promoter. For complementation of the odl mutant with p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC, homology arms were ordered as oligonucleotides and attached to the Gmr-mob fragment of pBBR1-MCS5. One homology arm started at the end of the kanamycin resistance gene sequence and extended 57\\u2009bp downstream. The other homology arm started at the end of Tetr and extended 54\\u2009bp upstream. After linear-plus-circular homologous recombination by Redαβ in GB08-red activated with arabinose (0.3%), the Gmr-mob fragment was inserted directly into the p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC plasmid, between Kmr and Tetr, to create the mobilizable plasmid p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC-mob. Insertion of diverse genes into E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′. For identification of the odilorhabdin self-resistance gene, the regions upstream and downstream from the odl locus of X. nematophila F1 were amplified by PCR with the L-ectB-KpnI and R-c-SacI primers (for abc genes) or the L-d-KpnI and R-j-SacI primers (for defghij genes), respectively, and inserted into pUC19 digested with KpnI and SacI. Genes a, b, and c were amplified separately, by PCR, with L-ectB-KpnI and R-ectB-SacI, L-b-KpnI and R-b-SacI, and L-c-KpnI and R-c-SacI, respectively, and inserted into pUC19 digested with KpnI and SacI. All these constructs were used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ and were assessed separately in odilorhabdin MIC assays after the addition of IPTG. We assessed the functionality of diverse OatA proteins from Photorhabdus strains or OatA-like proteins from Xenorhabdus strains, by amplifying the corresponding genes by PCR with appropriate primers (Table\\xa0S2) and inserting the amplicon between the KpnI and SacI sites of pUC19. The resulting constructs were then used to transform the E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ strain, and odilorhabdin MIC assays were performed after adding IPTG. The ngrA PCR fragment was inserted into the pBBR1-MCS2 broad-host-range vector with the L-ngrA-EcoRI and R-ngrA-BamHI primers digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the resulting construct was used to transform E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ before the addition of p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC. Cloning, overexpression, and purification of OatA. For purification of the N-acetyltransferase, the oatA gene was first amplified from X. nematophila genomic DNA with the F-Nterm-oatA-NdeI and R-Stop-oatA-SalI primers (Table\\xa0S2), digested with NdeI and SalI, and inserted into pET-28a previously digested with the same enzymes, at a position downstream from the T7 promoter and in fusion with the His tag, yielding pET-oatA. Fresh precultures of the overexpressing strain BL21(DE3) harboring the pET-oatA plasmid were grown overnight in 20\\u2009mL of LB broth supplemented with 20\\u2009μg/mL of kanamycin at 35°C. We inoculated 200\\u2009mL of LB broth supplemented with 20\\u2009μg/mL of kanamycin in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask with fresh overnight preculture (2% [vol/vol]) and incubated it at 35°C with shaking until the culture reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.4. The cells were induced by incubation with 0.2\\u2009mM IPTG for 3 h at 35°C. Cell pellets from two flasks were recovered by centrifugation at 6,000\\u2009×\\u2009g for 10\\u2009min, pooled, and washed once with saline. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 4\\u2009mL of 50\\u2009mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 100\\u2009mM NaCl, and 2% glycerol (ACT buffer). Cells were lysed by processing the cell suspension in a Fast-Prep-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals) for 20\\u2009s at a speed of 4 m/s with 100-μm glass beads/cell at a suspension ratio of 1/3. The samples were then centrifuged (13,000\\u2009×\\u2009g for 5\\u2009min) and the supernatants were recovered. Cell pellets were washed once with ACT buffer and the supernatants were pooled. Imidazole was added to a concentration of 10\\u2009mM before enzyme purification by the HisPur nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) Superflow agarose batch method (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, 1\\u2009mL of equilibrated Ni-NTA resin was added to 3\\u2009mL of sample. The mixture was incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking and was then washed four times with 25\\u2009mM imidazole in ACT wash buffer. Three elutions were performed, with 150, 250, and 500\\u2009mM imidazole. The eluates obtained with 250 and 500\\u2009mM imidazole were pooled and subjected to dialysis overnight against 75\\u2009mM HEPES at 4°C with a PurA-Lyzer cutoff at 3.5\\u2009kDa. Glycerol was added to the purified His-tagged OatA enzyme at a final concentration of 10% before storage at −20°C. Production and LC-MS analysis of secondary metabolites. For the detection of secondary metabolites in the culture supernatants, bacteria were collected from 96-h cultures by centrifugation at 7,000\\u2009×\\u2009g for 10\\u2009min and the supernatants after filtration on 0.2-μm filters were analyzed by LC-MS on an Agilent 1260 Infinity system coupled to an Agilent 6120 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The conditions for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation were as follows: a Symmetry C18 analytical column (5\\u2009μm, 4.6\\u2009mm\\u2009by\\u2009150\\u2009mm; Waters Corporation) was used in positive mode, the injection volume was 100\\u2009μL, mobile phase A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, mobile phase B was acetonitrile, and the linear gradient was 0% mobile phase B–100% mobile phase A at 0 min to 80% mobile phase B–20% mobile phase A at 40 min. UV detection was performed at 210\\u2009nm. During separation, the flow rate was 0.7\\u2009mL/min, and the column temperature was 37°C. In vitro acetylation of NOSO-95C. N-Acetylation of NOSO-95C or NOSO-95179 was performed in a polystyrene microtube with purified His-tagged OatA diluted to 300\\u2009μg/mL in 75\\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.5) supplemented with glycerol (5.7% [vol/vol]), 250\\u2009μM NOSO-95C or NOSO-95179, and 750\\u2009μM acetyl-CoA in 75\\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.5) for 24 h at 28°C. Aliquots were sampled at 15 min, 4 h, and 24 h. LC-MS/MS analysis. The acetylated NOSO-95C compounds were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Data were obtained in the positive mode on a Waters Alliance LC-MS/MS system (Waters Synapt G2-S mass spectrometer, Waters UPLC Acquity H-class). The HPLC column used was a Phenomenex EVO C18 T HPLC column (100\\u2009by\\u20092.1\\u2009mm, 1.7\\u2009μm) maintained at 25°C. Solvent A was H2O\\u2009plus\\u20090.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, solvent B was acetonitrile\\u2009plus\\u20090.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, and the flow rate was 0.5\\u2009mL/min. The mobile phase composition was 100% solvent A from 0\\u2009min to 5\\u2009min, ramped to 30% solvent B at 10\\u2009min. Sample injection volume was 0.1\\u2009μL. UV-visible detection was by absorbance at 200 to 500\\u2009nm. An ion spray (IS) voltage of 3,000\\u2009V, a source temperature of 140°C, a desolvation temperature of 450°C, a declustering potential (DP) of 30 V, and a collision energy (CE) in the range of 20 to 60\\u2009V were applied. Antibiotic activity. Total antimicrobial activity was assessed with Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 43816 as a target of strains harboring odl-BGC loci. We placed 15\\u2009μL of an overnight bacterial culture on a plate containing Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB; Bio-Rad) supplemented with 1.4% agarose (Sigma), and aTc (200\\u2009ng/mL) was added when required. After incubation for 72 h at 28°C, the bacteria were exposed to chloroform fumes for 30 min and allowed to dry in air for 30 min. The Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (200\\u2009μL of an overnight culture) target strain was then added to 8\\u2009mL of MHB supplemented with 0.7% agarose, which was poured over the bacterial colony. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, zones of growth inhibition were observed. The antibiotic activity of the samples acetylated in vitro was also assessed, as follows. We spotted 10 μL of sample onto Mueller-Hinton II (Becton, Dickinson) medium supplemented with 1.4% agarose. We poured an overnight culture of E. coli ATCC 25922 in LB broth (2% [vol/vol]) over the plate. The plate was allowed to dry and was then incubated at 35°C for 20 h. We then observed the plates to check for zones of growth inhibition. IVTT assay. The effect of in vitro acetylation on bacterial protein synthesis was investigated in the Expressway cell-free E. coli expression system (Invitrogen). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was amplified from the pCmGFP plasmid (47) and inserted into pEXP5-CT TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the resulting plasmid was used as a template for in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT). Reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, in 50 μL of reaction mixture, in the wells of a black polystyrene 96-half-well microplate (Greiner). Feed buffer was added after 30 min of incubation, to ensure optimal protein synthesis. Reactions were initiated by adding 1\\u2009μg of plasmid DNA. The plate was incubated at 30°C and fluorescence was measured every 20 min (λex\\u2009=\\u2009475\\u2009nm; λem\\u2009=\\u2009520\\u2009nm) with a Spark M10 microplate reader (Tecan). Fluorescence from GFP synthesis was recorded at 20\\u2009min after addition of feed buffer using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Gentamicin was used as positive control at 10\\u2009μM. Gene expression and identification of the compounds produced in complemented strains. We investigated the production of secondary metabolites in complemented strains, by incubating 100-mL broth cultures of ΔxcnKL::odl1 (MCS5) and ΔxcnKL::odl1 (p15A-Ptet-odl-BGC-mob) strains with gentamicin and aTc at 28°C for 78\\u2009h, centrifuging the cultures, and passing the supernatants through 0.2-μm filters and concentrating them 10-fold for LC-MS analysis. Natural odilorhabdins (NOSO-95A, -B, and -C) and xenocoumacin 1 (Xcn 1) were identified in culture supernatants by LC-MS on an Agilent 1260 Infinity system coupled to an Agilent 6120 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The conditions for HPLC separation were as follows: a Symmetry C18 analytical column (5\\u2009μm, 4.6\\u2009mm\\u2009by\\u2009150\\u2009mm; Waters Corporation) was used in positive mode, the injection volume was 100\\u2009μL, mobile phase A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, mobile phase B was acetonitrile, and the linear gradient was 0% mobile phase B–100% mobile phase A at 0 min to 80% mobile phase B–20% mobile phase A at 40 min. UV detection was performed at 210\\u2009nm. During separation, the flow rate was 0.7\\u2009mL/min, and the column temperature was 37°C. Construction of X. nematophila mutants. For the construction of a ΔoatA mutant, we first constructed an ngrA-deficient strain, to prevent the suicide of the X. nematophila producer strain. The upstream and downstream regions of the ngrA gene were amplified by PCR with the L-PCR1-ngrA-XbaI and R-PCR1-ngrA-BamHI primers for the upstream region (579\\u2009bp) and the L-ngrA2bis-BamHI and R-ngrA2bis-ApaI primers for the downstream region (522\\u2009bp). The two fragments obtained were inserted, together with the 3.8-kb BamHI fragment omega interposon cassette from pHP45-ΩCm conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, into pJQ200SK digested with XbaI and ApaI for insertion of the ΩCam cassette between the two PCR fragments. The resulting plasmid, pJQ-ngrA::ΩCm, was used to transform E. coli strain WM3064 and was introduced into X. nematophila F1 by mating. Allelic exchange was performed as previously described (48). Omega insertion was confirmed by PCR analysis, and the loss of NRP products was checked by antibiosis tests. The clone obtained was called the ΔngrA clone. For construction of the ΔngrA ΔoatA double mutant, the upstream and downstream regions of the oatA gene were amplified by PCR with the appropriate primer pairs, L-SacI-b/R-SpeI-oatA (upstream) and L-SalI-oatA/R-ApaI-odl1 (downstream), generating a 595-bp PCR1 fragment and a 611-bp PCR2 fragment, respectively (Table\\xa0S2). The pJQ-KmT1 plasmid was then digested with SpeI and SalI and the 2-kb KmT1 fragment containing the Kmr cassette and T1 terminators was purified with the Zymo gel purification kit (Ozyme). These three fragments were inserted into pJQ200SK digested with SacI and ApaI to introduce the Km-T1 cassette between the two PCR fragments. The pJQ-oatA::KmT1 plasmid was then introduced, by mating, into the X. nematophila ngrA mutant, and allelic exchange was performed. Kmr and Sacr exconjugants were selected on LB agar supplemented with 4% sucrose and kanamycin. The KmT1 insertion was checked by PCR analysis with the two primers L-b-KpnI/R-Km-PvuI amplifying a 1,791-bp fragment (Table\\xa0S2), with confirmation by DNA sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). The resulting recombinant clone was named the ΔngrA ΔoatA clone. MIC determination. MICs were determined in triplicate, in accordance with CLSI guidelines but with modifications for Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus strains and for E. coli constructs (49). For Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus strains, inoculum preparation was modified as follows: 3\\u2009mL of MHB II (Becton, Dickinson, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was inoculated with bacteria grown overnight in LB broth and cultured to an OD600 of 0.11 to 0.15. The inoculum was prepared as described in the CLSI guide, with a 1:20 dilution in saline. Multiplates were incubated for 24 h at 28°C or for longer if the results were unclear. For E. coli constructs, a modified method of inoculum preparation was used in which about 10 colonies were picked from MH agar supplemented with 100\\u2009μg/mL of ampicillin and used to inoculate 10\\u2009mL of MHB II supplemented with 100\\u2009μg/mL of ampicillin. The inoculum was incubated for 1.5 to 2 h at 35°C, with shaking at 150\\u2009rpm, until the OD600 reached 0.15 to 0.25. IPTG was added at a concentration of 0.2\\u2009mM for induction, and the culture was incubated for 30\\u2009min at 35°C, with shaking at 150\\u2009rpm. The inoculum was then diluted 1:20 in saline to obtain the final inoculum. The reaction medium consisted of MHB II supplemented with 0.2\\u2009mM IPTG. For other E. coli constructs requiring aTc induction, aTc was added to the isolate used for streaking and the reaction medium at a concentration of 200\\u2009ng/mL. In all other respects, the procedure corresponded to the CLSI method.',\n",
       " 'Bacterial strains and culture conditions. Strains used for cloning or conjugation were E. coli XL11 blue (Agilent technologies) and the methylation-deficient E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 (47), respectively. E. coli strains were grown and maintained at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium or LB agar (LB with 1.5% agar) supplemented with 30\\u2009mg/mL chloramphenicol, 50\\u2009mg/mL kanamycin, and 50\\u2009mg/mL apramycin, when required. Streptomyces strains were obtained from stocks of the actinobacteria collection of the pharmaceutical biology department of the University of Tübingen. S. olindensis DAUFPE 5622 was obtained through G. Padilla from the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of Sao Paulo. S. peucetius DSM 40754 was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH (DSMZ). Streptomyces strains were grown and maintained at 30°C in trypticase soy (TS) broth and/or TS agar (Sigma-Aldrich), mannitol-soy agar (2% mannitol, 2% soybean meal, 10\\u2009mM MgCl2, 1.5% agar), R2YE (48), and R5M to produce cosmomycin D (5). Cosmomycin D production, purification, and structure integrity. Doxorubicin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cosmomycin D utilized in this study was isolated and purified from 5-L R5M medium fermentations of S. olindensis, as previously reported (6). For analysis of cosmomycin production, the crude extract was dissolved in methanol (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [LC-MS] grade; Merck) and applied to a solid-phase extraction cartridge (Strata-XL, 100\\u2009μm polymeric reversed phase, 2\\xa0g; Phenomenex). The adsorbed compounds were eluted in fractions using a stepwise gradient of 10% to 100% methanol and concentrated under reduced pressure. After resuspension of the residue, 10-μL samples were analyzed by high-performance (HP) LC-MS, using a reverse-phase column (Luna Omega Polar C18, 3\\u2009μm, 150\\u2009mm by 3.0\\u2009mm; Phenomenex) and a mobile phase of acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.06% formic acid in water (solvent B). A gradient of 10% B to 100% B in 22\\u2009min, ending with 100% B for an additional 8\\u2009min, with a flow rate of 0.2\\u2009mL/min was used. The fraction containing COSD (m/z 1,189.54) was further purified using a Waters HPLC system (Waters 1525 binary pump with a 7725i Rheodyne injection port, a Kromega solvent degasser and a Waters 996 photodiode array detector), using a linear gradient of 40% B to 60% B in 15\\u2009min, followed by a linear gradient of 60% B to 95% B in 20\\u2009min and an additional 10\\u2009min at 95% B (solvent A, 0.06% formic acid in water; solvent B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 2\\u2009mL/min (Luna Omega Polar C18 column, 5\\u2009μm, 250\\u2009mm by 4.6\\u2009mm; Phenomenex) to obtain ~5\\u2009mg pure COSD. For structure determination, high-resolution LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)/MS and MS/MS measurements were performed on a Bruker Daltonics maXis 4G (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) connected to a Thermo Scientific UltiMate 3000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using a reversed-phase Luna Omega Polar C18 column (3\\u2009μm, 150 by 3\\u2009mm) at a flow rate of 0.3\\u2009mL/min. A linear gradient of 10% to 100% solvent B in 40\\u2009min, ending with 100% B for an additional 15\\u2009min, was used (solvent A, 0.1% formic acid in water; solvent B, acetonitrile), with an injection volume of 5 μL and UV monitoring occurred at 210, 254, 280, and 360\\u2009nm. The range of MS acquisition was m/z 50 to 1,800. The acquisition parameters for the positive ion polarity were a capillary voltage of 4.5, nebulizer gas pressure (nitrogen) set to 2.0\\u2009bar, and dry gas flow of 9.0 L/min at an ion source temperature of 200°C. The measurements were internally calibrated using sodium formate as a reference. The data were compared to data of cosmomycin D and to published data of various related compounds (Fig. S9, Table S1) (6, 16). DNA isolation and manipulation. Plasmid preparation from E. coli was carried out with a commercial kit (QIAprep spin miniprep kit; Qiagen). Total Streptomyces DNA isolation, restriction endonuclease digestions, and ligations were performed as described previously (48, 49). DNA sequencing was performed at Eurofins Genomics Germany GmbH. Cloning and construction of plasmids for heterologous expression of cosmomycin resistance genes in S. lividans TK24. cosI, cosJ, cosP, and cosU genes were amplified from S. olindensis DAUFPE 5622 genomic DNA using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase from New England Biolabs, Inc., according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using the primers listed in Table S3. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pUWL_Apra-oriT vector containing an apramycin resistance gene cassette under the control of the constitutively active ermE* promoter to ensure a high level of expression. These constructs (Table S4) were transferred into E. coli XL1 blue and further into E. coli ET12567/PUZ8002 to obtain nonmethylated DNA. The constructs pRCWL04 (cosI and cosJ), pRCWL05 (cosP), and pRCWL06 (cosU) were finally transferred into S. lividans TK24 by conjugation (50). Expression and purification of recombinant CosP and CosP(C38S) in E. coli. For cloning and expression of the mycothiol peroxidase CosP, the IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside)-inducible vector pHIS8 (51) was used to generate an N-terminally His8-tagged CosP. cosP was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (gDNA) of S. olindensis using primers containing recognition sequences for EcoRI and HindIII, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the expression vector through ligation, taking advantage of the EcoRI/HindIII restriction sites, generating plasmid pRCWL04. The integrity of the resulting plasmids was verified via sequencing. Plasmid pRCWL04 was further modified in the CALA coding region of the enzyme (MPx), exchanging cysteine (C) for serine (S) at position 38, using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies), resulting in plasmid pRCWL04M. Heterologous expression and purification of His8-tagged proteins were carried out using E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3)pLys (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) as the recombinant host strain. Strains containing the corresponding plasmid were cultivated in 1 L LB broth supplemented with 25\\u2009μg/mL chloramphenicol and 50\\u2009μg/mL kanamycin at 37°C and 220\\u2009rpm. At an optical density at 600\\xa0nm (OD600) of 0.6, the temperature was adjusted to 18°C and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5\\u2009mM. The overnight culture was harvested by centrifugation at 8,000\\u2009rpm and 4°C for 10\\u2009min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (3\\u2009mL/g pellet) (50\\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500\\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerin [vol/vol], 1% Tween 20 [vol/vol], 20\\u2009mM imidazole, 10\\u2009mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5\\u2009mg/mL lysozyme, 0.5\\u2009mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], and 4\\u2009mg/mL lysozyme). The cells were sonicated (Sonifier generator; Branson) on ice for 10\\u2009min (amplitude of 40%, 5\\xa0s on/5\\xa0s off). After centrifugation for 45\\u2009min at 18,000\\u2009rpm (4°C), the clear lysate was filtered (0.45\\u2009μm) for affinity chromatography. Supernatant of each culture was applied to affinity chromatography using an Äkta start platform (GE Healthcare) equipped with a 5-mL His-Trap HP column (GE Healthcare). The His-tagged protein was washed and then eluted from the column using a linear gradient of 0 to 100% elution buffer over 60\\u2009min and collected by a Frac30 system (GE Healthcare). Fractions were tested for the presence of the respective proteins by SDS-PAGE and were concentrated and buffer exchanged into 25\\u2009mM KH2PO4,100\\u2009mM NaCl, pH 8.3, using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Mr cutoff of 10,000; Millipore). Concentrations of the purified proteins were measured spectrophotometrically at 280\\u2009nm using the calculated extinction coefficients (calculated with http://web.expasy.org/protparam/). The purified proteins were stored in aliquots at −80°C. Purification of total protein from Streptomyces strains. S. olindensis and S. lividans pUWL (apramycin) were incubated in 100\\u2009mL TS broth for 48 h at 30°C at 220\\u2009rpm. Five\\u2009milliliters of the preculture was added to 100\\u2009mL of YEME (48) medium and incubated for a further 2\\u2009days at 30°C at 220\\u2009rpm. The cultures were stored on ice for 20\\u2009min and then centrifuged at 6,000\\u2009×\\u2009g for 30\\u2009min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (5\\u2009mL/g pellet) (50\\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500\\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerin [vol/vol], 1% Tween 20 [vol/vol], 20\\u2009mM imidazole, 10\\u2009mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5\\u2009mM PMSF, and 4\\u2009mg/mL lysozyme). The cells were ruptured with a French press under 10,000 lb/in2 pressure, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4°C for 45\\u2009min at 15,000\\u2009rpm. The clear lysate was filtered (0.45\\u2009μm) for buffer exchange (25\\u2009mM KH2PO4, 100\\u2009mM NaCl, pH 8.3). The purified proteins were quantified and stored at the same concentration at −80°C. Peroxide and protein quantification. The concentration of H2O2 stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was measured at 240\\u2009nm (ε240\\xa0nm\\u2009=\\u200943.6 M−1\\u2009cm−1) (52). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280\\u2009nm; the molar absorption coefficients were calculated from the amino acid compositions (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/) (53). The calculated protein concentrations refer to those of monomers. FOX assay. WT MPx and its mutant were reduced with 10× excess dithiothreitol (DTT) in buffer solution (250\\u2009mM Tris buffer, 500\\u2009mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and incubated for 30\\u2009min at room temperature. The ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange (FOX) assay (54) was used to determine the H2O2 consumption over time by the purified MPx or the C38S mutant and total proteins from S. olindensis and S. peucetius strains isolated during antibiotic production. All measurements were performed in three replicates for each treatment. The H2O2 concentration was calculated based on an H2O2 standard curve. In the case of purified MPx and mutant MPx, 100\\u2009μM was mixed with 100\\u2009μM H2O2 in 100\\u2009mM assay buffer, pH 8, at 30°C, and 10-μL amounts of the reaction mixture were taken after 15, 30, 45, 90, and 180\\u2009s and mixed with 490\\u2009μL of the FOX reaction mixture (100\\u2009μM xylenol orange, 250\\u2009μM ammonium ferrous sulfate, 100\\u2009mM sorbitol, and 25\\u2009mM H2SO4) and incubated for 30\\u2009min at room temperature in darkness. At the end of the reaction, the A560 was measured on a 96-well plate reader (FLUOstar Omega) as described elsewhere (54). To isolate total proteins from S. olindensis and S. lividans, cells were initially grown in TS broth at 30°C for 24 h. One percent preculture was used to inoculate the main R5M culture. This culture was grown at 30°C for protein extraction at 24, 48, and 72\\u2009h during the production of cosmomycin D for S. olindensis. Then, 100\\u2009mM H2O2 was added to equal concentrations of total proteins. Ten-microliter aliquots were taken after 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600\\u2009s, as described elsewhere (54). Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis. Total RNA of producer strain S. olindensis WT was extracted using RNAprotect bacterial reagent and the RNeasy minikit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). The frozen samples were ground in dry ice. Residual DNA was removed by treating with RNase-free DNase according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). An aliquot of 1\\u2009μg of DNase-treated RNA was transcribed into cDNA using iScript reverse transcription supermix for reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). qPCR analysis. For qPCR, a Bio-Rad iQ5 thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) was programmed for an initial denaturation of 5\\u2009min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 5\\xa0s at 95°C and 15\\xa0s at 60°C. The specificity of the qPCR primers (Table S3) was evaluated by the melting curve, using a gradient of 55 to 95°C at 1°C each 30\\xa0s (Fig. S10). For each amplification reaction mixture volume, 2\\u2009μL of cDNA (50\\u2009ng), 10 μM each primer, and 10\\u2009μL of QuantiNova probe PCR kit (Qiagen) were used. iQ5 Optical System software was used to determine the relative quantification of the target genes in comparison to the reference gene. The selection of an endogenous gene, to be used as a normalizer, was made by testing the cycle threshold (CT) values for the different described endogenous genes (Fig. S10). The hdrB housekeeping gene presented the lowest ΔCT and the highest amplification efficiency, resulting in its selection as the normalizer for gene expression analysis. Determination of MICs of anthracyclines. Sterile 96-well plates were used to generate MIC values. Each well contained 100\\u2009μL of Bennett’s agar and doxorubicin or cosmomycin D with concentrations ranging from 0 to 512\\u2009μg/mL. Each well was inoculated with ~103\\nStreptomyces spores. Plates were incubated overnight at 30°C. Growth was compared with that of the controls, S. peucetius, S. olindensis, and S. lividans TK24/pUWL (empty vector). Construction of SSNs and GNN. Web tools of the Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI), available at https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/ (22), were used to generated sequence similarity networks (SSNs) from KDN80073.1 and the glutathione peroxidase Pfam family (PF00255). For the seed SSN obtained with the KDN80073.1 FASTA sequence, the option Maximum Number of Retrieve Sequences\\u2009=\\u2009100 in the BLAST Retrieval Options tab was selected, and then the score threshold was adjusted to 65 using Percent Identity vs Alignment Score Box Plot in order to set up only the presence of nodes with identity equal to 70% or above. For the initial submission of PF00255, all settings were kept at the default, and a first SSN was generated using a Score threshold of 50, which means each edge joins nodes with at least 55% similarity. The second SSN used a slightly higher score threshold of 60 (nodes are joined if they share about 61% or more identity). Using the EFI Genome Neighborhood Tool (EFI-GNT tab) of the same website, a genome neighborhood network (GNN) and genome neighborhood diagrams (GNDs) of the second SSN were obtained using as parameters Neighborhood Size\\u2009=\\u200920 and Cooccurrence Percentage Lower Limit\\u2009=\\u200920.',\n",
       " 'Soil Sample Preparation Twelve soil samples (≥10 g) were collected from several different locations in Sweden (Table 1). Seven soil samples (1–7) were from Uppsala County along The Linnaeus Trails (Herbationes Upsalienses), one sample (8) was from Gävleborg County north of Uppsala, three samples (9–11) were from Norrbotten County, in the mountains above the Arctic Circle, and the last soil sample (12) came from a sandy beach in Gotland County, an island in the Baltic Sea. Samples were taken by pressing or digging a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube into the soil surface. The samples were kept cold until the time of dilution and plating. Aliquots of the individual soil samples were deep frozen and selected samples were later sent in a frozen state to BaseClear BV (Leiden, Netherlands) for DNA extraction, NGS (next generation sequencing) and analysis of microbial community composition (Supplementary Material).

Isolation of MDR Pedobacter spp. As growth medium base for isolation of bacteria, a modified CN medium was used (Gavrish et al., 2008). The modified medium base was denoted as NBCA (Nutrient Broth/Casamino Acid agar medium) and contained: 1 g Difco Nutrient Broth (BD Difco Ltd., Detroit, MI, Untied States), 1 g Casamino Acids (BD Difco Ltd.), 15 g Bacto agar (Saveen & Werner, Limhamn, Sweden) in 1 L of deionized water. Fungicides and various antibiotics were added to NBCA after autoclaving and cooling the medium to 50°C. To reduce the growth of molds, two fungicides, cycloheximide, and nystatin, were added to the final concentration of (100 mg/L) and (10 mg/L), respectively. The NBCA was also supplemented with varying combinations of antibiotics to provide the selection conditions for the isolation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Selected antibiotics covered different antibiotic classes and mechanisms of action and when supplemented to the NBCA the following final concentrations were used: ampicillin (AMP, 20 mg/L), kanamycin (KAN, 20 mg/L), nalidixic acid (NAL, 20 mg/L), streptomycin (STR, 20 mg/L) and erythromycin (ERY, 20 mg/L), lincomycin (LIN 10 mg/L) was 10 mg/L, gentamicin (GEN, 5 mg/L), vancomycin (VAN, 2 mg/L), polymyxin B (POL, 2 mg/L), and ciprofloxacin (CIP, 1 mg/L). Approximately 4 g of each individual soil sample was thoroughly mixed by vortexing with 40 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The mixture was allowed to settle for at least 10 min and then 1 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 9 mL of sterile PBS in a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube. From this dilution, 0.1 mL was spread onto the NBCA isolation plates without (control) or with different combinations of antibiotics. The plates were then incubated at 20°C for approximately one week in darkness to avoid degradation of light sensitive antibiotics. Morphologically different bacterial colonies were afterward re-streaked on Vegetable Peptone Broth Agar plates (VPA), containing 10 g Vegetable Peptone Broth (VPB; Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom), and 15 g Bacto Agar (Saveen & Werner) in 1 L deionized water. Antibiotic Resistance Pattern of P. cryoconitis UP508 The antibiotic resistance pattern of isolate UP508 was established using NBCA agar base (as above) supplemented with the following individual antibiotics at 20 mg/L: AMP, CIP, ERY, GEN, KAN, LIN, NAL, POL, STR, and VAN. The isolate was inoculated on the plates, which were incubated for 2–3 days in darkness at room temperature and inspected for bacterial growth. Identification and Phylogeny Twenty-eight bacterial strains isolated from soil samples were selected for identification by means of sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. Sequencing was also performed for the five type isolates of different Pedobacter species purchased from the Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Micro-organisms [BCCM/LMG, Pedobacter cryoconitis A37 (LMG 21415T) and P. lusitanus NL19 (LMG 29220T)], the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures [DSMZ, Pedobacter hartonius WB 3.3-3 (DSM 19033T) and Pedobacter westerhofensis WB 3.3-22 (DSM 19036T)] as well as from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms [JCM, Pedobacter himalayensis HHS22 (JCM 12171T)]. Briefly, colony PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed with the universal primers 27F (AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) and 1492R (TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT) followed by purification of amplified PCR-products (QIAquick PCR purifications kit, QIAGEN). Sequencing was then performed by Macrogen Europe (EZ-sequencing, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The resulting DNA sequencing chromatograms were assembled using the Geneious R8 software and manually inspected (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). The resulting 16S rRNA sequences were deposited at GenBank (accession numbers MW332350 to MW332382). The BLAST database for 16S rRNA sequences (Altschul et al., 1997) of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI2) was then used to retrieve the closest possible identity of the isolates. For aligning the sequences, the online MAFFT version 7 multiple alignment program for amino acid or nucleotide sequences3 was used and Neighbor Joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees were obtained after estimating the robustness of the internal tree branches by bootstrap analysis (Jukes–Cantor/bootstrap 1000) using 1000 replications (Katoh et al., 2019). Culturing, Collection, and Extraction of Metabolites Bacterial strains isolated from soil samples and the reference Pedobacter species, were grown in liquid cultures (150 mL in 500-mL Erlenmeyer flasks) using half strength VPB [15 g VPB (Oxoid Ltd.) in 1 L deionized water]. Cultures were either started by transferring a loop (10 μL) of 24–48 h-old bacterial colonies grown on VPA plates or by transferring 100 μL of deep-frozen isolate stock per 150 mL VPB. The cultures were incubated on a rotary shaker (130 rpm) for 96–120 h at 20°C in darkness. To collect extracellular metabolites, one sterile nylon mesh bag containing a polymeric resin, Sepabeads® SP850 (Sigma-Aldrich), was submerged in each actively growing culture, approximately 16–24 h after inoculation (approximately 8 g of resin per bag). At harvest, each adsorbent resin bag was washed with deionized water to remove bacterial cells and culture resins. Each bag was subsequently extracted with 2 × 20 mL MeOH and 2 × 20 mL MeCN, and the extracts were pooled and analyzed by UHPLC-MS and -MSMS (below), and the residues were dried in a vacuum centrifuge for subsequent fractionation by preparative HPLC (below). Analysis of Culture Extracts by UHPLC-MS and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis Adsorbent extracts were centrifuged (5 min, 13,000 rpm) and analyzed (injection volume 1 μL) by UHPLC-MS on a reversed phase column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.5 μm, Thermo Accucore Vanquish RP-MS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II instrument connected to a maXis Impact ESI-QTOF MS (Bruker), using a gradient of MeCN in water (20–55% MeCN in 3 min, 95% MeCN for 1.2 min, at 0.9 mL/min, with 0.2% formic acid). The MS was operated in positive mode with scanning of m/z 50–1500, and calibration of the mass spectra was obtained by a sodium formate clusters. The software Compass DataAnalysis 4.3 (Bruker Daltonics) was used for calibration and data analysis. Isopedopeptins were identified by comparison with authentic compounds from previous work (Nord et al., 2020), and identification of other compounds was attempted by comparison of HRMS-data with databases (Antibase and Combined Chemical Dictionary). UHPLC-MSMS was run on the same instrument, column and UHPLC-conditions, on extracts or on extracts treated with 2% NaOMe in MeOH for 30 min at room temperature, using the auto MSMS function (1+, 2+, and 3+ precursor ions, m/z 200–1100, ramped fragmentation energies: 1+: 30/40/45 eV for m/z 100/500/1000; 2+: 15/25/30 eV for m/z 100/500/1000; 3+: 10/20/25 eV for m/z 100/500/1000). Following conversion of UHPLC-MS data to mzXML format using DataAnalysis 4.3, ion-chromatogram peak picking in the range 20–200 s was done by the program XCMS in the software environment R using the centWave method (peakwidth 3–20 s, m/z tolerance 5 ppm, noise 10,000) (Smith et al., 2006; Tautenhahn and Böttcher, 2008). XCMS was used for subsequent peak grouping and missing peak filling. The resulting peak-areas of the molecular features of each sample were normalized against the sum of peak-areas, and the resulting relative peak-areas were then 10-logarithmized. To reduce the complexity of the data set, only the dominant molecular feature for each molecule was used, and features with peak-areas <200,000 were not included. The data were used to construct a heat map with hierarchical clustering of both strains and molecular features (distance: Euclidean, clustering: complete). Fractionation of Culture Extracts by Preparative HPLC Based on the UHPLC-MS analyses and the heat map data, representative isolates were selected for fractionation and subsequent bioassays. The dried culture extracts were dissolved in 1 mL 50% MeCN and following centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 5 min), 1-mL samples were fractionated on a reversed phase preparative HPLC column (Luna Omega PS C18, 21.2 × 100 mm, 5 μm), eluted with a gradient of MeCN in water (15–50% MeCN in 15 min, 50–95% MeCN in 2 min, and a hold at 95% MeCN for 8 min, at 10 mL/min) with 0.2% formic acid. The eluent was monitored at 210 nm and fractions (2 mL) were collected in deep-well plates (start after 5 min). Aliquots (100 μL) of all fractions were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates, dried over-night in a fume-hood, and subsequently analyzed for antibacterial activity (below). In vitro Bioassay of Antibacterial Activity Chromatographic fractions of the extracts of selected isolates (above) were assayed for antibacterial activity using an earlier developed protocol (Thaning et al., 2001; Nord et al., 2019) with the following human pathogenic bacteria or bacteria commonly used in such bioassays: Escherichia coli LMG 15862, Acinetobacter baumannii LMG 1041T, Enterobacter cloacae LMG 2783T, Klebsiella pneumoniae LMG 20218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 6395, and Staphylococcus aureus LMG 15975, all purchased from BCCM/LMG and maintained as advised by supplier. Briefly, cell suspensions (0.1 mL/well) at a concentration of 104 cells per mL half strength VBP (Oxoid Ltd.) were added to the microtiter plates with dried aliquots of HPLC fractions (above), and the plates were incubated at 37°C in darkness for 16–24 h. The effect on the bacterial growth was estimated visually according to the following scale: 3/red – full growth inhibition, 2/orange – intermediate growth inhibition, 1/yellow – weak growth inhibition, 0 – no growth inhibition. Positive controls were wells with cell suspensions in VPB only, and sterile VPB was used as negative control.',\n",
       " 'Fungal strains and general molecular techniques The wild-type strain of P. roqueforti CECT 2905 (ATCC 10110), originally isolated from a blue cheese sample, was used in this work. Penicillium roqueforti transformants were obtained by protoplast transformation of strain CECT 2905, as described below. Potato dextrose agar (PDA; Merck, Germany) was used for the routine growth of all the strains. The protocol described by Gil-Duran et al. [16] was used for DNA isolation. For total RNA purification, the strains were grown on YES agar (Bacto Yeast Extract (Difco, USA) 20 g/l, sucrose (Merck, Germany, biochemical grade) 150 g/l and Bacto Agar (Difco, USA) 20 g/l) for 7 days at 28°C. Total RNA was isolated exactly as described previously [16]. RT-PCR experiments were performed as described by Ravanal et al. [17]. RACE-PCR experiments were performed with the FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer`s protocol. Bioinformatic identification and characterization of the mpa cluster of P. roqueforti The highly conserved MpaF protein, encoded by the mpaF gene from P. brevicompactum, was used to scan the whole draft genome of P. roqueforti [18] by tBlastN. Two contigs (GenBank accessions CBMR010000200 and CBMR010000309) containing ORFs encoding proteins with significant similarity to MpaF were identified and downloaded. The vicinities of each of these ORFs were then manually analyzed by BlastX, BlastP and BlastN. All Blast searches were performed using the online web interface at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Multiple alignments of deduced proteins were performed using Clustal Omega at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/. Construction of plasmids to silence the seven genes of the MPA gene cluster RNA-mediated gene silencing technology has been successfully used to silence genes in P. roqueforti [16, 19]. Here we used the same experimental approach. Plasmid pJL43-RNAi [20] was used to generate seven constructs (S1 Fig) as follows: pJL43-RNAi was digested with NcoI. In parallel, a small fragment of each gene from the mpa cluster was amplified with suitable primers and was also digested with NcoI. Finally, each digested fragment was ligated into pJL43-RNAi, thus giving rise to the plasmids pJL-RNAi-mpaA, pJL-RNAi-mpaB, pJL-RNAi-mpaC, pJL-RNAi-mpaDE, pJL-RNAi-mpaF, pJL-RNAi-mpaG and pJL-RNAi-mpaH, which were used to transform P. roqueforti (see below). These plasmids contain the respective DNA fragment flanked by two promoters in opposite directions (S1 Fig), which generate double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNAs). These dsRNAs activate the fungal RNA-silencing machinery, resulting in the degradation of target mRNAs [20]. S1 Table shows the primer sequences and the size of the fragment ligated in each construct. Transformation of P. roqueforti P. roqueforti transformants were obtained by introducing the genetic constructs described above into strain CECT 2905 by protoplast transformation. Protoplast obtainment, transformation, selection of transformants on Czapek-sorbitol medium containing phleomycin, and obtainment of homokaryotic strains were carried out exactly as described before [16]. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis The silencing level of each gene in the transformants was analyzed by qRT-PCR as described previously [16]. Total RNA was quantified in a MultiSkan GO quantification system (Thermo Scientific, Germany). Two μg were used to synthesize cDNA using RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Scientific, Germany). Each qRT-PCR reaction (20 μl) contained 10 μl of KAPA SYBR Fast qRT-PCR Master Mix 2x (Kapa Biosystems, USA), 0.4 μl of each primer (at a concentration of 10 μM each), 0.4 μl de 50x ROX High/Low, 6.8 μl of water and 2 μl of cDNA. qRT-PCR reactions were carried out using the StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). Amplification conditions were as follows: 20 s at 95°C and 40 cycles of 3 s at 95°C and 30 s at 50°C. Three replicates were performed for each analysis and suitable negative controls were included. Relative gene expression values were determined by the comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) method using β-tubulin gene expression as a normalization control. S2 Table describes the sequence of the primer sets used in qRT-PCR. All exhibited suitable efficiencies as required for the comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) method (S3 Table). Extraction and HPLC analysis of MPA Each fungal strain was grown on YES agar (see the composition above) for 7 days at 28°C. For each strain the mycelium from three Petri dishes was scraped off the agar. After that, the remaining agar was triturated. Both the mycelium and the triturated agar were extracted separately according to the method described by O´Brien et al. [21], with some modifications. Each sample (mycelium or agar) was extracted overnight with 50 ml of an ethyl acetate: dichloromethane: methanol (3:2:1) mixture containing formic acid (1%). The mixtures were then sonicated for 30 minutes, filtered through a 0.45 μm Millex-HV hydrophilic PVDF syringe filter (Merck Millipore), and evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator. The extracts were resuspended in 500 μl of methanol (HPLC grade) just before HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis was performed on a Waters 1525 HPLC system (Waters, Ireland) equipped with a Waters 1525 Binary HPLC pump and a Waters 2996 Photodiode Array (PDA) Detector, using the chromatographic method described by Nielsen et al. [22] with some modifications. Briefly, 20 μl of the methanol suspension described before were injected into a 4.6 x 250 mm (5 μm) SunFire C18 column (Waters, Ireland). The column was held at 35°C. A solvent gradient with water and acetonitrile (both acidified with 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min was used. The gradient began with 15% acetonitrile and was increased to 68% acetonitrile after 25 minutes. The acetonitrile was then increased to 100% within 2 min. This percentage remained constant for 5 minutes before returning to 15% acetonitrile. MPA was detected by UV absorption at 300 nm and quantified using the pure compound as standard (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). MPA showed a retention time of 18.25 min. For each strain used, the quantity of MPA was normalized by the dry weight of the fungal mycelia. For this purpose, and after the extraction with ethyl acetate/dichloromethane/methanol, the mycelia from each sample were dried according to García-Rico et al. [23]. Analysis of the MPA resistance in P. roqueforti strains MPA treatment of the fungi was performed by the spot assay method described by Hansen et al. [24]. Briefly, spores from P. roqueforti strains were harvested, and a suspension of 1x106 spores/ml was obtained. From this initial suspension, 10-fold dilution series were performed on freshly made CYA-plates containing 100 μg MPA/ml (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). Plates were incubated for 9 days at 28°C.',\n",

Fosmid 7C6 with a 33.6\\u2009kb DNA insert which covers the complete PHT biosynthetic gene cluster and flanking sequence of 5.5\\u2009kb upstream and 3.3\\u2009kb downstream was screened out by PCR. Gene phtU of Fosmid 7C6 was replaced by Apramycin resistant gene aac(3)IV from plasmid pIJ773 by PCR targeting with primer pair DUF1/DUR2 (Table S1)37. Gene aac(3)IV was eliminated by FLP-recombinase mediated excision in E.coli DH5α/BT340 to generate a disruption cassette pWHU2001. Plasmids pWHU2001 were transferred into P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A cells by electroporation and single crossover recombinant strains resistant to chloramphenicol were picked up. The phtU gene in-frame deletion mutant strains CL001 resulted from double crossover were selected out by rounds of relaxation and chloramphenicol sensitivity tests and then validated by PCR with primer pair VLF1/VLR2 (Figure S2A, S2B, Table S1). Identical strategy was employed for gene phtQ and phtL in-frame deletion. Primer pair DQF1/DQR2 (Table S1) was used in phtQ PCR targeting and primer pair VQF1/VQR2 (Table S1) was used in phtQ- mutant strain CL002 PCR validation (Figure S2C, S2D). Primer pair DLF1/DLR2 (Table S1) was used in phtL PCR targeting and primer pair VLF1/VLR2 (Table S1) was used in phtL- mutant strain CL003 PCR validation (Figure S2E, S2F). To the gene complementation of phtU and phtQ in CL001 and CL002 strains, the constitutive promotor of gene phtA was employed to construct infusion genes PphtA-ORFphtU and PphtA-ORFphtQ. A 227\\u2009bp DNA fragment containing PphtA was amplified by PCR with primer pair PphtAF1/PphtAR2 (Table S1). The ORF region of gene phtU was amplified by PCR with primer pair PhtUF1/PhtUR2 (Table S1). These two fragments were insert into the BamHI site of a RK2-derived plasmid pRKaraRED to give recombinant plasmid pWHU2004. Transformation of pWHU2004 into phtU- mutant strain CL001 gave phtU gene complementation strain CL004. Identical strategy was employed for gene phtQ complementation strain CL005 construction with the exception of that phtQ was amplified with primer pair PhtQF1/PhtQR2 (Table S1) and the recombinant plasmid was defined as pWHU2005. ArgK over-expression and enzyme assay Gene argK was amplified by PCR with primer pair OKF1/OKR2 (Table S1) and inserted into the BamHI/XhoI locus of vector pET28a. His·tag-ArgK fusion proteins were over-expressed and purified with standard protocol36. Authentic standards of L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg and L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg were purchased from Life Tein L.T.D. Company (Beijing) (Figure S3). Transcarbamylase enzyme assay were performed in 1.5\\u2009mL eppendorf tubes with a system as 0.2\\u2009mg purified ArgK, 20\\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50\\u2009mM NaCl, 1.5\\u2009mM Lithium carbamoyphosphate dibasic hydrate, 1\\u2009mM L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg, 2\\u2009mM MgSO4 and 0.5\\u2009mM ATP, 200\\u2009μL in total. ArgK was absent in the negative control reactions while the other factors remained identical. The enzyme was removed from the reaction system with a 10\\u2009KDa centrifugal filter at 10,000\\u2009rpm for 10\\u2009minutes. The residual sections were diluted to ten times volume of the original reaction system before injected into the HPLC-MS analyzer. HPLC-MS analysis Culture supernatants for PHTs and biosynthetic intermediates discovery were thirty times concentrated by rotovaping at room temperature and then cut by methanol with a final concentration of 90%. Samples were dried out by rotovaping and re-suspended in ddH2O for HPLC-MS analysis. A Thermo hypercarb column (100\\u2009×\\u20092.1\\u2009mm, 5\\u2009μm, column temperature 30\\u2009°C) with a flow rate of 0.4\\u2009mL/min was employed in the HPLC section. The HPLC gradient was 0% solvent B (4\\u2009min), 0–40% solvent B (12\\u2009min), 40–100% solvent B (3\\u2009min), 100% solvent B (3\\u2009min), 100–0% solvent B (3\\u2009min), 0% solvent B (5\\u2009min). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in H2O and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in CH3CN. High resolution MS analysis was carried out in a positive mode on a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL Orbitrap mass spectrometer as described previously38. PHTs samples from the culture supernatants of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A were used to build the MS fragmentation fingerprint of PHTs and desulfonated PHTs by selected ion reaction (SIR) method. Daughter ions with m/z ratio at 189 and 374 were recognized to be the characteristic fragments of PHTs. To screen for PHTs biosynthetic intermediates, PIS was performed in a positive mode on a Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantum Access MAX instrument (monitoring m/z ratio at 189 and 374) equipped with a Thermo Scientific Accela 600 pump. Target ions were selected out for HR tandem MS analysis as described above to figure out the elemental compositions. Enzyme assay samples were analyzed on the TSQ instrument with a selected ion monitoring (SIM) scan mode with a range from m/z ratio at 360 to 430. Reaction products were double checked by HR tandem MS analysis on the Orbitrap instrument. NMR analysis 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of tripeptides L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg (20\\u2009mg) and L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg (20\\u2009mg) were recorded on Agilent 400\\u2009MHz instrument in D2O, respectively (Figure S3). Culture supernatants of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448A were cut by methanol and dried out as described above. Residues were re-suspended in ddH2O with 10% D2O and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on Agilent 400\\u2009MHz instrument. Bioassay of P. syringae 1448A against L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg To evaluate the toxicity of L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg to PHT producers P. syringae 1448A, authentic tripeptide L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg was added to the culture media of 1448A. Two kinds of media, LB (Tryptone 10.0\\u2009g, Yeast extract 5.0\\u2009g and NaCl 5.0\\u2009g for 1 liter, pH 7.2) and MM (Sucrose 5.0\\u2009g, KH2PO4 2.0\\u2009g, (NH4)2HPO4 2.0\\u2009g, MgSO4·7H2O 1.0\\u2009g, FeSO4·7H2O 0.01\\u2009g and MnSO4 0.01\\u2009g for 1 liter, pH 7.2), were employed in the assay. Two kinds of compound concentrations, 1\\u2009mM and 10\\u2009mM, were tested respectively. The OD600 value of bacterial cultures at different time points was monitored by a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer.',\n",
       " 'Strains and media Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 was maintained and cultivated to prepare genomic DNA according to\\n[12]. Streptomyces coelicolor ΔvanRS was gently donated by Hee-Jeon Hong, University of Cambridge, UK\\n[16], Streptomyces lividans TK24 and Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10595 were a gift from Mervyn Bibb, John Innes Institute, Norwich, UK\\n[14]. Streptomyces spp. strains were maintained as spores in 10% (v/v) glycerol and propagated in MYM and SFM agar media\\n[14]. For growing ex-conjugants containing pIJ86, pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn, pIJ86ΩN-vanYn and pIJ86ΩvanYn, agar plates were added with 50\\xa0μg/mL of apramycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Agar plates were incubated at 28°C. Liquid media for streptomycetes were YEME -containing in (w/v) 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% bacto-peptone, 0.3% oxoid malt extract, 1% glucose in deionized water, pH\\xa07.0- and BTSB -containing in (w/v) 10%\\xa0sucrose, 1% yeast extract, 1% glucose, 0.5% NaCl, 0.5% soybean meal, 1.7% tryptone and 0.25% K2HPO4 in deionized water, pH\\xa07.0. All medium components were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy), unless otherwise stated. Colonies were picked up from agar plates and inoculated into 300\\xa0mL baffled flasks containing 50\\xa0mL of YEME or BTSB. Flask cultures were incubated on a rotary shaker at 200\\xa0rpm and 28°C. Media and culture conditions for E. coli were described in\\n[12]. E. coli DH5α was used as host for plasmid construction. Escherichia coli ET12567/pUZ8002\\n[5] was used as non-methylating plasmid donor strain for intergeneric conjugation with Streptomyces spp. Cells were propagated in Luria-Bertani (LB) (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) broth at 37°C. Plasmids pIJ86 (gift from Mervyn Bibb) was used as a multi-copy vector for heterologous expression in Streptomyces spp.\\n[12]. Plasmids pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn and pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn were constructed as follow. Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche, Milan, Italy) was used to amplify vanYn using genomic DNA of Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 as template with oligonucleotide primers vanY004Fw (5′-ATAGGATCCCCAGACTGGAGGAGAGGGATGAGGAGAAGCGAGGGTGAC-3′) and vanY004Rev (5′-GATAAGCTTCTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGACCCGGCCCCCGTTCCGGCT-3′) that introduced a C-terminal tag of six histidine residues and the HindIII and BamHI (Roche, Milan, Italy) restriction sites, respectively, into the PCR product, allowing insertion into the multiple cloning site of the multicopy expression vector pIJ86. The vanYn with a N-terminal tag of six histidines was produced using as oligonucleotide primers vanY003Fw (5′-ATATTTGGATCCATGCACCACCACCACCACCACAGGAGAAGCGAGGGTGACGAC-3′) and vanY003Rev (5′-GATAAGCTTCCCGTGCCCTAGCTAGACCCGGCCCCCGTTCCGGCT-3′) that introduced HindIII and BamHI restriction sites. The vanYn without any tag was produced using as oligonucleotide primers vanY86Fw (5′-ATGGATCCCAGACTGGAGGAGAGGGATG-3′) and vanY86Rev (5′-GATAAGCTTCGATCCTGGAGTTCGTCTTC-3′) that introduced BamHI and HindIII restriction sites\\n[12]. The PCR products were purified, digested with HindIII and BamHI, and ligated with pIJ86 vector that had similarly been digested, to produce pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn, pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn and pIJ86ΩvanYn. These vectors with vanYn transcribed from the strong constitutive ermE* promoter\\n[14] were used to transform E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 cells. Intergeneric conjugation Intergeneric conjugation was performed according to a modified protocol from\\n[5,14]. In brief, a culture of the donor E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 containing the selected plasmid was grown in 10\\xa0mL LB supplemented with 50\\xa0μg/mL apramycin, 25\\xa0μg/mL chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and 50\\xa0μg/mL kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) to an OD600nm of 0.4. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with an equal volume of LB, and resuspended in 1\\xa0mL of LB. For each conjugation approximately 108Streptomyces spp. spores, collected from agar plates in sterile glycerol, were added to 500\\xa0μL 2X YT broth\\n[14], heat shocked at 50°C for 10\\xa0minutes and then allowed to cool. 500\\xa0μL of E. coli cells were added to 500\\xa0μL of heat-shocked spores and mixed briefly. Mixture was plated out on SFM or MYM agar added with 10\\xa0mM MgCl2 and incubated for 20\\xa0hours at 30°C. Plates were overlaid with 1\\xa0mL of water containing 500\\xa0μg/mL nalidixic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and 50\\xa0μg/mL apramycin and were incubated at 30°C until colonies appear. Colony PCR and sequencing The presence of pIJ86ΩvanYn, pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn or pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn was checked by colony PCR and DNA sequencing of ex-conjugants. Single colonies were transferred onto DNA medium\\n[14]. Plates were incubated at 30°C overnight. Mycelium was scraped from the plates using a sterile toothpick and was introduced into 50\\xa0μL 100%\\xa0v/v DMSO in a 1.5\\xa0mL tube. The tube was shaken vigorously for 1–2\\xa0hours and then centrifuged: 2.5\\xa0μL of the supernatant were used for PCR. For control, 1\\xa0μL of DNA samples were mixed with 1.5\\xa0μL DMSO. One initial step of 10\\xa0minutes at 95°C was included in the PCR program to ensure the complete cell lysis. The PCR was performed for 30\\xa0cycles as follows: 95°C for 45\\xa0seconds, 56°C for 30\\xa0seconds and 72°C for 1\\xa0minute. vanY004Fw, vanY004Rev, vanY003Fw and vanY003Rev, vanY86Fw and vanY86Rev were used as oligonucleotide primers. VanYn expression Recombinant Streptomyces spp. were grown aerobically in 100\\xa0mL YEME and BTSB media added with apramycin (50\\xa0μg/mL) in 500\\xa0mL Erlenmayer flasks for different time intervals (up to 196\\xa0h) at 28°C and 200\\xa0rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 39000\\u2009×\\u2009g for 15\\xa0minutes and washed three times with water. The supernatant (named “extracellular fraction”) was collected and precipitated with the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) method. TCA precipitation was performed adding 1/10 (v/v) of 100% TCA (w/v) to an appropriate medium volume and vortexed for 15\\xa0seconds, placed on ice for 15\\xa0minutes and then centrifugated at 14,000\\u2009×\\u2009g for 10\\xa0minutes. The supernatant was removed and discarded. The pellet was washed twice with 100\\xa0μL of pure acetone and then air dried for about 60\\xa0minutes. Washed cells were suspended in 10\\xa0mL of 0.1\\xa0M Tris–HCl buffer (pH\\xa07.6) containing 0.4\\xa0M sucrose and 6.7\\xa0mg of lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). After 6\\xa0hours of incubation at 37°C, the mixture was centrifuged at 12800\\u2009×\\u2009g for 10\\xa0minutes, obtaining spheroplasts clearly distinguishable at the optical microscopic observation (40X, Zeiss Primo Star microscope, Arese, Italy). The supernatant thus obtained was named “cell wall fraction”. The spheroplasts were washed with 0.4\\xa0M sucrose and then 5\\xa0mL of water was added to burst the spheroplasts. The suspension was centrifuged at 2000\\u2009×\\u2009g for 30\\xa0minutes. The supernatant and the precipitate were named as “cell-free soluble extract” and “cell-free insoluble fraction”, respectively. Scale up in 3-L reactor Flask cultures of recombinant Streptomyces spp. grown in YEME and apramycin (50\\xa0μg/mL) for 48–72\\xa0hours were used to inoculate - at 2.5% (v/v) - 3-L P-100 Applikon glass reactor (height 25\\xa0cm, diameter 13\\xa0cm) equipped with a AD1030 Biocontroller and AD1032 motor, containing 2\\xa0L YEME and apramycin (50\\xa0μg/mL). Cultivations in fermenter were carried out for 168\\xa0hours at 28°C, with stirring at 500\\xa0rpm (corresponding to 1.17\\xa0m/s of tip speed) and 2\\xa0L/min aeration rate. Dissolved oxygen (measured as % of the initial pO2 value) was monitored using an Ingold polarographic oxygen electrode. The pH values of culture broths were monitored using a pH meter. Foam production was controlled by adding Antifoam SE-15 (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) through an antifoam sensor. VanYn purification For protein purification, cultures of recombinant S. venezuelae grown in YEME medium were harvested and centrifuged at 39000\\u2009×\\u2009g for 15\\xa0min at 4°C. Cells were sonicated in a buffer solution 300\\xa0mM NaCl, 30\\xa0mM imidazole, 10\\xa0μg/mL DNAseI (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), 0.19\\xa0mg/mL PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and 0.7\\xa0μg/mL pepstatine (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) in 50\\xa0mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH\\xa07.0), for 15\\xa0cycles of 30\\xa0seconds each on ice. After a centrifugation at 39000\\u2009×\\u2009g for 60\\xa0min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected. N-His6-VanYn was purified by affinity chromatography onto a HiTrap chelating affinity column (1.6\\u2009×\\u20092.5\\xa0cm, 5\\xa0mL, GE Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy) equilibrated with 50\\xa0mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH\\xa07.0) containing 30\\xa0mM imidazole and 300\\xa0mM NaCl, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After extensive washing, the bound protein was eluted with 50\\xa0mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH\\xa07.0) containing 300\\xa0mM NaCl and 300\\xa0mM imidazole\\n[17]. For C-His6-tagged VanYn, 6\\xa0M urea was added to the equilibration buffer as denaturant; in order to refold the protein bound to the column, a linear gradient from 6 to 0\\xa0M of urea (2\\xa0mL/min) was performed before starting the elution phase\\n[29]. Fractions containing pure recombinant VanYn were loaded on PD10 Sephadex G25 column (Ge Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy) equilibrated with 50\\xa0mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH\\xa07.0). Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE (using 15% polyacrylamide gels and staining with Coomassie brilliant blue) and Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was estimated using the extinction coefficient at 280\\xa0nm (45258\\xa0M-1\\xa0cm-1) determined by urea denaturation and the theoretical extinction coefficient based on amino acid sequence. Western blot analysis Following electrophoresis of proteins from bacterial cell fractions (corresponding to 100\\xa0μL of culture) or affinity-purified fractions and the transfer to a nitrocellulose sheet (GE Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy), the membrane was incubated with 1:1000 (v/v) His•Tag® Antibody HRP Conjugate Kit (Novagen, Milan, Italy) in alkalin-casein solution 1% (v/v). The immunorecognition was visualized by ECL Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare Sciences, Milan, Italy). The quantitative analysis was performed using the bioinformatics program Quantity One (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy) and C-His6-VanYn from E. coli as standard protein. For molecular mass determination, PageRuler™ Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) markers were used. Protein content in each fraction was assayed by Biuret method and SDS-PAGE analysis (Additional file\\n1: Figure S1 and Additional file\\n2: Figure S2). Alkaline extraction of d,d-carboxypeptidase All manipulations were carried out at 0 to 4°C. Cells at different growth phases were harvested and suspended in 2\\xa0ml per gram of cells of physiological solution (0.9% (v/v) NaCl). The mycelium was fragmented by mild sonication and cells were collected by centrifugation at 39,000\\u2009×\\u2009g for 15\\xa0minutes. Alkaline extractions were carried out by suspending the cell suspension in ice-cold distilled water containing the proteinase inhibitors (0.19\\xa0mg/ml PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan Italy) and 0.7\\xa0μg/ml pepstatine (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan Italy) and then bringing the suspension to pH\\xa012 by adding an appropriate volume of 2.5\\xa0N NaOH. After centrifugation (28,000\\u2009×\\u2009g, 15\\xa0min, 4°C), the supernatants were neutralized to pH\\xa07 by the addition of 0.5\\xa0M sodium acetate (pH\\xa05.4)\\n[30]. d,d-dipeptidase and d,d-carboxypeptidase assays Enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the release of d-Ala from Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, acetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala and d-Ala-d-Ala by a d-amino acid oxidase/peroxidase coupled colorimetric assay (i) or by reaction with a fluorescent reagent (ii). All substrates were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. One unit of d,d-carboxypeptidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1\\xa0μmol of d-Ala per min. (i) D-Amino acid oxidase/peroxidase assay\\n[17,18]. Reaction mixtures contained 10\\xa0mM of the substrate (Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, or acetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala or d-Ala-d-Ala), 5\\xa0mM of the peroxidase colorimetric substrate 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP, from Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), 3\\xa0U/mL RgDAAO (d-amino acid oxidase from Rhodotorula gracilis[18]), 7.5\\xa0U/mL horseradish peroxidase (HRP from Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), 6\\xa0mM phenol in 50\\xa0mM 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane (pH\\xa07.4) in a final volume of 1\\xa0mL. At 25°C, 40\\xa0μg of recombinant VanYn or the amount of cell wall alkaline extract correspondent to 50\\xa0mg of cells, or the soluble fraction or the supernatant, was added to the reaction mixture and the increase in absorbance (ΔAbs/min) at 510\\xa0nm was measured for the test sample as well as for the control to which no VanYn was added. A molar extinction coefficient for chinonemine of 6.58/mM\\xa0cm was used. (ii) Fluorimetric o–phthaldialdehyde (OPTA) method\\n[20]. Reaction mixtures contained 10\\xa0mM Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, 40\\xa0μg of recombinant VanYn in 50\\xa0mM phosphate buffer (pH\\xa07.0) in a final volume of 200\\xa0μL. After 10\\xa0minutes at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 50\\xa0μL of 250\\xa0mM HCl followed by 750\\xa0μL of water. Enzymatically released d-Ala was detected by the addition of 100\\xa0μL of fluoraldehyde (OPTA) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) to 100\\xa0μL of the reaction mix, followed by incubation at room temperature for 5\\xa0min. 800\\xa0μL of water was added and 200\\xa0μL was removed: the fluorescence intensity was measured (λex\\u2009=\\u2009340\\xa0nm; λem\\u2009=\\u2009455\\xa0nm) in a fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan Infinite® 200 Pro, Milan, Italy). Assays were quantified from a standard curve prepared with known amounts of d-Ala. Circular dichroism measurements Far-UV CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-715 (Jasco Europe, Cremella, Italy) spectropolarimeter in the 195–250\\xa0nm wavelength range. Measurements were made in quartz cuvettes of 1\\xa0mm pathlength, employing protein solutions of 0.1\\xa0mg/mL, and were corrected for buffer contribution. Secondary structure fractions were calculated from deconvolution of the CD spectra using the program K2D2 (http://www.ogic.ca/projects/k2d2/)\\n[31]. Determination of the biological activity: the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of teicoplanin and vancomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) to S. venezuelae containing pIJ86 or pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn or pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn was determined in MYM agar added with 50\\xa0μg/mL apramycin and increasing concentrations of glycopeptides. The inoculum was 106\\xa0cfu/mL (after mycelium sonication with Sonics Vibracell VCX 130 – power 130\\xa0Watt, 230 Volt, 50–60 Hertz, frequency 20\\xa0Hz 5\\xa0minutes of sonication, 20\\xa0seconds for each cycles with 90% of amplitude), and plates were incubated at 28°C until colonies appeared. MIC was the lowest concentration of the antibiotic that inhibits the visible growth of the recombinant S. venezuelae strains\\n[32].',\n",
       " 'Isolation and Characterization of Discosia Strains Strain TTI-0863 was isolated by transferring mycelial fragments emerging from the cut end of a dead hardwood log onto cornmeal agar (Becton Dickinson) amended with streptomycin sulfate and chlortetracycline at 50 μg/mL. Strain TTI-0885 was recovered from mixed pine-hardwood forest litter using the dilution-to-extinction method (Torres et al., 2011). For morphological analysis and photography, strains were grown on oatmeal-wheat germ agar, V8 juice agar, and double-strength malt-yeast extract agar. Strains are available from the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research Culture Collection (NRRL) as strains NRRL 66951 (TTI-0863) and NRRL 66952 (TTI-0885). General Experimental Procedures Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data were collected on a Bruker 500 MHz NMR instrument equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance cryoprobe at 298 K, with CDCl3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane as internal standard (δH/δC = 0). Semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separations and HPLC-MS (mass spectrometry) data were acquired on an Agilent 1260 system equipped with a diode array detector (DAD) and coupled to an Agilent 6120 single quadrupole mass spectrometer, with a binary solvent system consisting of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). Growth Conditions To produce mycelial extracts for agar zone of inhibition (ZOI) assays, strains TTI-0863 and TTI-0885 were grown on five media in 12-mL fermentations. For the seed cultures, cryopreserved agar plugs were grown for 7 days in YM agar plates (malt extract 10 g, yeast extract 2 g, agar 20 g, 1000 mL deionized H2O). Six agar discs from each culture were inoculated into 50 mL of SMY (maltose 40 g, neopeptone 10 g, yeast extract 10 g, agar 3 g, 1000 mL deionized H2O) in a 250-mL baffled flask.

Cultures in the Wheat 1 and CYS80 media were incubated statically with vials slanted at a 45° angle; the other media were agitated at 220 rpm. Fermentations were carried out at 24°C for 14 days, after which for each fermentation, 17 mL of 2-butanone was added and agitated at 220 rpm for 2 h. Eight mL of the organic phase was transferred to a glass vial and evaporated to dryness. The extracts were dissolved in 0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) prior to assay. For a scaled-up cultivation, 100 mL of SMY seed media in a 500 mL flask was grown for 4 days at 23°C and 180 rpm, then 2.5 mL was transferred to each of ten 250-mL baffled flask containing 50 mL of MMK2 media. Fermentations were carried out at 24°C for 10 days. Two-Plate Thermal Sensitivity and Zone of Inhibition Assays The assay for temperature-selective growth inhibition of C. neoformans was described previously (Xu et al., 2018). Overnight cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Sigma-Aldrich), and C. albicans ATCC 10231 and C. neoformans H99 grown in YM broth (1% malt extract, 0.2% yeast extract in deionized H2O) at 37°C were diluted with ATCC 43300 sterile H2O to an OD600 of 0.4 for S. aureus and 0.8 for C. albicans and C. neoformans. One-mL aliquots of the resulting mixture were combined with 35-mL aliquots of YMA (or LB agar for S. aureus) at 45°C and dispensed into one-well plates (Nunc Omnitray). Test wells (4 mm diam) were aspirated from the solidified plates with a syringe tip, and 10 μL of each extract in DMSO was applied to each well. Sets of fungal fermentation extracts were tested at a density of 20 extracts/plate in paired plates. One plate of each pair was incubated at 25 and 37°C. ZOIs were photographed after 48 h.',\n",

Protein expression, purification and biochemical assay To express and purify pDHAD, primers pDHAD-pET-F and pDHAD-pET-R were used to amplify a 1.7 kb DNA fragment containing pdhad (AT3G23940). The PCR product was cloned into pET28a using NheI and NotI restriction sites. The resulting plasmid pDHAD-pET was transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3) to give TY08. To express and purify fDHAD (XP_001208445.1), primers fDHAD-pET-F and fDHAD-pET-R were used to amplify a 1.6 kb DNA fragment containing fdhad. The PCR product was cloned into pET28a using NdeI and NotI restriction sites. The resulted plasmid fDHAD-pET was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to obtain TY09. To express and purify AstD (XP_001213593.1), primers AstD-pET-F and AstD-pET-R were used to amplify a 1.6 kb DNA fragment containing astD. The PCR product was cloned into pET28a using NdeI and NotI restriction sites. The resulted plasmid AstD-pET was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to obtain TY10. All DHADs fused a 6×His-tag with a molecular weight ~62 kD were expressed at 16°C 220 rpm for 20 h after 100 μM IPTG induction (IPTG was added when OD600 = 0.8). Cells of 1 L culture were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4°C. Cell pellet was resuspended in 15 mL Buffer A10 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 8% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole). The cells were lysed by sonication, and the insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation at 16000 rpm at 4°C. The protein supernatant was then incubated with 3 mL Ni-NTA for 4 h with slow, constant rotation at 4°C. Subsequently the Ni-NTA resin was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A50 (Buffer A + 50 mM imidazole). For elution of the target protein, the Ni-NTA resin was incubated for 10 min with 6 mL Buffer A300 (Buffer A + 300 mM imidazole). The supernatant from the elution step was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE together with the supernatants from the other purification steps. The elution fraction containing the recombinant protein was buffer exchanged into storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM GSH). In vitro activity assays were carried out in 50 μL reaction mixture containing storage buffer, 10 mM (±)-sodium α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate hydrate (4) and 0.5 μM of purified DHAD enzyme. The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme. After 0.5 h incubation at 30°C, the reactions were stopped by adding equal volume of ethanol. Approximately 0.1 volume of 100 mM phenylhydrazine (PHH) was added to derivatize the product 3-methyl-2-oxo-butanoic acid (5) into 6 at room temperature for 30 min. 20 μL of the reaction mixture was subject to LC-MS analysis. The area of the HPLC peak with UV absorption at 350 nm were used to quantify the amount of 6. (Extended Data Fig. 2). The inhibition percentage of AA on DHADs determined using in vitro biochemical assays are calculated by following equation: \\ninhibitionpercentage=1-initialreactionratewithAAinitialreactionratewithoutAA Growth inhibition assay of S. cerevisiae on plates or in the tubes S. cerevisiae was grown in isoleucine, leucine and valine (ILV) dropout media (20 g/L glucose, 0.67 g/L Difco™ Yeast Nitrogen Base w/o amino acids, 18 mg/L adenine, arginine 76 mg/L, asparagine 76 mg/L, aspartic acid 76 mg/L, glutamic acid 76 mg/L, histidine 76 mg/L, lysine 76 mg/L, methionine 76 mg/L, phenylalanine 76 mg/L, serine 76 mg/L, threonine 76 mg/L, tryptophan 76 mg/L, tyrosine 76 mg/L) to test growth inhibition of AA on S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae was incubated at 28°C until OD600 of the control strain without AA treatment reached about 0.8. The ratio of yeast OD600 in media with AA treatment to yeast OD600 in media without AA was calculated as the percentage of growth inhibition. The inhibition curve was plotted as percentage of inhibition versus AA concentrations. To further prove AA affects BCAA biosynthesis, isoleucine, leucine and valine was also complemented to the media with or without treatment of AA. The growth curves of TY05, TY06 and TY07 were also plotted in Extended Data Fig. 4. The OD600 was recorded for every 20 min over a total of 50 h. Percent inhibition. The growth inhibition percentage of AA on S. cerevisiae strain is calculated by dividing the cell density (OD600) of the AA-treated strain to the corresponding untreated strains when OD600 reaches ~ 0.8 using following equation: \\ngrowthinhibitionpercentage=1-OD600ofAAtreatedstrain0.8 in which 0.8 is the OD600 of untreated strain. Growth inhibition assay of plants on plates or in the tubes MS (2.16 g/L Murashige and Skoog basal medium, 8 g/L sucrose, 8 g/L agar) media was used to test the growth inhibition of AA on A. thaliana, Solanum lycopersicum, and Zea mays. A. thaliana, S. lycopersicum, and Z. mays were grown under long day condition (16/8 h light/dark) using cool-white fluorescence bulbs as the light resource at 23°C. AA was dissolved in ethanol and added to the media before inoculating strains or growing plants. The media of control treatment contains the same amount of ethanol, but without AA. Plant growth inhibition assay by spraying AA was firstly dissolved in ethanol and then added to solvent (0.06 g/L Finale® Bayer Inc. + 20 g/L EtOH). The control plants were treated with solvent containing ethanol only. A. thaliana that are resistant to glufosinate (containing the bar gene) were grown under long day condition (16/8 h light/dark) using cool-white fluorescence bulbs as the light resource at 23°C. Spraying treatments began upon the seed germination, and was repeated once every two days with approximately 0.4 mL AA solution per time per pot. Structure determination of holo-pDHAD The gene encoding pDHAD (residues 35–608) was cloned into pET21a derivative vector pSJ2 with an eight histidine (8×His) tag and a TEV protease cleavage site at the N-terminus. The following primers were used for cloning: the forward primer DHAD-F and the reverse primer DHAD-R. The double mutant K559A/K560A for efficient crystallization was designed using the surface entropy reduction prediction (SERp) server34. Mutations were generated by PCR using the forward primer K559AK560A-F and reverse primer K559AK560A-R. All constructed plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. pDHAD purified under aerobic conditions was found to contain no iron-sulfur cluster (apo form). Hence we performed [2Fe-2S] Cluster reconstitution under the atmosphere of nitrogen in an anaerobic box. The protein was incubated with FeCl3 at the ratio of 1:10 for 1 h on ice and then 10 equivalents of Na2S per protein was added drop-wise every 30 min for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then incubated overnight. Excess FeCl3 and Na2S were removed using a SephadexTM G-25 Fine column (GE Healthcare)26. The reconstituted holo-pDHAD was crystallized in an anaerobic box. The proteins (at 10 mg/mL) were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the reservoir solution in a 50 μL volume of 2 μL and equilibrated against the reservoir solution, using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 16°C. Crystals for diffraction were observed in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0, 1.5 M ammonium sulfate after 5 d. All crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after cryo-protected with solution containing 25% glycerol, 1.5 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0. The data were collected at 100K and at the Beam Line 19U1 in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Diffraction data of holo-pDHAD was collected at the wavelength of 0.97774 Å. The best crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.11 Å. The Ramachandran plot favored (%), allowed (%) and outlier (%) are 98.05, 1.60, and 0.36 respectively. All data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL3000 package35. The crystals belonged to space group P42212. The statistics of the data collection are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. The holo-pDHAD structure was solved by the molecular replacement method Phaser embedded in the CCP4i suite and the L-arabinonate dehydratase crystal structure (PDB_ID: 5J83) as the search model. All the side chains were removed during the molecular replacement process36,37. The resulting model were refined against the diffraction data using the REFMAC5 program of CCP4i38. Based on the improved electron density, the side chains of holo-pDHAD protein, iron sulfur cluster, water molecule, acetate ion, sulfate ions, and magnesium ion were manually built using the program WinCoot39. The Rwork and Rfree values of the structure are 17.67% and 22.15%, respectively. The detailed refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. The geometry of the model was validated by WinCoot. Structural factor and coordinate of holo-pDHAD have been deposited in the Protein Bank (PDB code: 5ZE4). Homology modelling of AstD and docking of substrate or AA into active site of holo-pDHAD The structure of holo-pDHAD was prepared in Schrodinger suite software under OPLS3 force field40. Hydrogen atoms were added to reconstituted crystal structures according to the physiological pH (7.0) with the PROPKA tool in Protein Preparation tool in Maestro to optimize the hydrogen bond network26,41. Constrained energy minimizations were conducted on the full-atomic models, with heavy atom coverage to 0.5 Å. The homology model was performed in Modeller 9.1842, using the crystal structure of holo-pDHAD solved in this work as a template. Sequence alignment in Modeller indicated that AstD and pDHAD shared 56.8% sequence identity and 75.0% sequence similarity (Extended Data Fig. 6). All the highly conserved residues and motifs were properly aligned. A total of 2000 models were generated for each target in Modeller with the fully annealed protocol. The optimal models were chosen for docking studies according to DOPE (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy) score. All ligand structures were built in Schrodinger Maestro software26. The LigPrep module in Schrodinger software was introduced for geometric optimization by using OPLS3 force field40. The ionization state of ligands were calculated with Epik tool employing Hammett and Taft methods in conjunction with ionization and tautomerization tools43. The docking of a ligand to the receptor was performed using Glide44. We included cofactors observed in crystal structure during the docking. Since both water and SO42− occupied the catalytic site, they were excluded prior to docking. Cubic boxes centered on the ligand mass center with a radius 8 Å for all ligands defined the docking binding regions. Flexible ligand docking was executed for all structures. Ten poses per ligand out of 20,000 were included in the post-docking energy minimization. The best scored pose for the ligand was chosen as the initial structure for further study. The MM/GBSA method was introduced to evaluate the ligand binding affinity based on the best scored docking pose in Schrodinger software. Figures are prepared in PyMOL and Inkscape45,46. Both of native substrate α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate and AA were docked into the catalytic site of pDHAD. The cross-section electrostatic surface map shows this unique catalytic pocket has a positively charged internal and a hydrophobic entrance, which binds to negatively charged “head” and hydrophobic “tail” of substrate or AA respectively. Thus the negatively charged “head” can lead both of the substrate and AA into the catalytic chamber. The bulky hydrophobic tricyclic moiety of AA, however, provides stronger hydrophobic interactions to the entrance and blocks the entrance of active site due to the hydrophobic residues at the entrance, including G68, A71, I72, I134, A133, M141, V212, F215, M498 and P501. In contrast, the smaller “tail” of native substrate provides less interactions to entrance because the smaller size limits efficient hydrophobic contact to nearby residues. This implies that once AA binds to pDHAD, it can prevent substrate approaching the active site. We also introduced molecular mechanics generalized Born and surface area (MM/GBSA) continuum solvation method, an widely used approach for relative binding energy calculation, to evaluate the relative binding affinity for both ligands47. The MM/GBSA calculations had been done in Prime48 (Schrödinger 2015 suite). The MM/GBSA energy was calculated using following equation: \\nΔGbind=Ecomplex-Eprotein-Eligand E denotes energy and includes terms such as protein–ligand van der Waals contacts, electrostatic interactions, ligand desolvation, and internal strain (ligand and protein) energies, using VSGB2.0 implicit solvent model with the OPLS2005 force field. The solvent entropy is also included in the VSGB2.0 energy model, as it is for other Generalized Born (GB) and Poison–Boltzmann (PB) continuum solvent models. MM/GBSA calculation shows that the relative binding energy for AA and α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate is −18.6 ± 0.3 kcal/mol and −13.3 ± 0.2 kcal/mol respectively, which shows the binding constant of AA to active site is about 6000 times greater than α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate. This further confirms that AA is a competitive inhibitor of pDHAD. Cytotoxicity assay of AA Cell proliferation experiments were performed in a 96-well format (five replicates per sample) using melanoma cell line A375 and SK-MEL-1. AA treatments were initiated 24 h postseeding for 72 h, and cell survival was quantified using CellTiter-GLO assay (Promega). Cross experiment of A. thaliana To make male sterile A. thaliana, AA was added to chemical hybridization agent (CHA) formulation (250 μM AA, 2% ethanol, 0.1% Tween-80, 1% corn oil in water), which has less inhibition effect on the growth of A. thaliana. Flowers of the AA treated col-0 were selected as the female parent. The non-treated A. thaliana containing a glufosinate resistant gene were used as male parent to donate pollen. 2-week old F1 progeny resulting from the cross were treated by Finale (11.3% glufosinate-ammonium) at 1:2000 dilution. The results are summarized in Extended Data Fig. 9. Construction of the transgenic plants The coding sequence of AstD was codon optimized for A. thaliana. A chloroplast localization signal (CLS) of 35-amino acid residues derived from the N-terminal of A. thaliana DHAD (MQATIFSPRATLFPCKPLLPSHNVNSRRPSIISCS) was fused to N-terminus of the codon optimized AstD. A 3×FLAG-tag was inserted between the CLS and the codon optimized AstD (Supplementary Table 6). The gene block containing CLS, FLAG-tag and astD was synthesized and then cloned into pEG202 vector using Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix (ThermoFisher scientific). The original CaMV 35S promoter of pEG202 was substituted by Ubiquitin-10 promoter to drive the expression of AstD. The construct was electro-transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain Agl0 followed by A. thaliana transformation using the standard floral dip method49. The A. thaliana Col-0 ecotype was transformed. Positive transgenic plants were selected using the glufosinate resistance marker, and were tested for survival in presence of AA. Protein expression verification with western blot Approximately 0.5 gram of leaf tissue of transgenic A. thaliana was grounded in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were homogenized in 2× SDS buffer followed by 5-min centrifuge at 21,000 g to remove undissolved debris. The supernatant containing resolved proteins were loaded onto a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel, and separated using MOPS running buffer. Transfer was conducted using iBlot2 dry transfer device and PVDF membrane. The total proteins were stained with Ponceau to demonstrate equal loading. Western blotting was performed using Sigma monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-Peroxidase antibody, followed by detection using Amersham ECL Prime detection reagent.

       " 'Strains, plasmids, and growth conditions Streptomyces sp. CB03234-S [11] was used in this study. The strains and plasmids used or constructed in this study, as well as all designed primers, are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (Supplementary Material). CB03234-S and related mutants were grown on Gauze’s medium (G1) at 30\\xa0°C for sporulation. Tryptic soy broth (TSB) was used as the seed medium. Optimal production (OP) medium (15\\xa0g/L soluble starch, 15\\xa0g/L yeast extract, 2\\xa0g/L CaCO3, 0.1\\xa0g/L CuSO4•5H2O, 5\\xa0mg/L NaI, 1% w/w Diaion HP20 resins) was used for liquid fermentation. E. coil DH5α was used for cloning and S17-1 was used for intergeneric conjugation with CB03234-S. Mannitol soya flour solid medium was used for intergeneric conjugation. Antibiotics (40\\xa0mg/L nalidixic acid, 50\\xa0mg/L apramycin, 60\\xa0mg/L streptomycin, 25\\xa0mg/L thiostrepton, or 50\\xa0mg/L kanamycin) were added as required. All common biological and chemical reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources. Genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis of CB03234-S CB03234-S was cultivated in TSB medium at 30\\xa0°C for 36\\xa0h. Mycelia were collected, washed with ddH2O, and sent to Biomarker Technologies Corporation (Beijing, China) for genome sequencing on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. High-quality clean reads were mapped onto the CB03234 reference genome (NCBI accession Number: NZ_LIYH00000000). The annotation of secondary metabolite BGCs in the sequenced genome of CB03234-S (Table S3) was performed using antiSMASH 5.0 software [28]. RNA sequencing data of CB03234 and CB03234-S from our previous study [29] were analyzed herein, and the raw sequencing reads were uploaded to the sequencing read archive (NCBI accession: PRJNA530700). Gene expression was normalized as fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM). The expression level of the internal housekeeping gene hrdB (encoding the principal sigma factor of RNA polymerase) was used as a reference to normalize the expression of target genes from different competitive BGCs, and heat maps were drawn using Log2 (target gene/hrdB) transformed data. Inactivation of competitive BGCs in CB03234-S Genetic manipulation of CB03234-S was carried out according to previously described procedures [30]. The core genes of seven competitive BGCs (Table S4) were deleted individually via homologous recombination. To construct a gene-knockout plasmid, regions approximately 2\\xa0kb upstream and downstream of the target gene, as well as the 810\\xa0bp thiostrepton resistance gene (tsr), were amplified using the high-fidelity Golden PCR Mix TSE101 (Tsingke Biotech. Co., Changsha, China). These DNA fragments were fused together and cloned into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pOJ260 using the Trelief SoSoo Cloning Kit (Tsingke). The resulting plasmid was verified by sequencing (Tsingke) and then introduced into CB03234-S via conjugation. The thiostrepton-resistant (TsrR) and apramycin-sensitive (AprS) exconjugants were verified using PCR amplification (Fig. S1) to obtain the BGC inactivation mutants, S1001‒S1007 (Table S1). The same procedure was used to construct the double inactivation plasmids, but tsr was replaced with the kanamycin resistance gene (kan). The resulting plasmids were introduced into S1004 (Δ8-BGC) to generate S1008 (Δ2/8-BGCs) and S1009 (Δ15/Δ8-BGCs), which were both AprS, KanR, and TsrR. The genotypes of the S1008 and S1009 mutants were confirmed using PCR verification (Fig. S1). Overexpression of target genes in CB03234-S and derivative mutants The core genes tnmE3/E4/E5/E/E10, post-modification genes tnmL/H, and putative self-resistance genes tnmB/T1/S3 were overexpressed in CB03234-S. Each target gene or gene combination was amplified and cloned into linearized pSET152 using HindIII/NdeI sites via seamless cloning. The constructed overexpression plasmids were respectively introduced into CB03234-S to generate mutants S1011‒S1018 (Table S1). The S1010 mutant carrying null pSET152 was also obtained as the negative control. Finally, tnmE10, tnmE, or tnmE/E10 were further introduced into S1009 to generate mutants S1019‒S1021 (Table S1). Evaluating TNM-A tolerance of selected strains To test the tolerance of each target strain to TNM-A, 1\\xa0mg/mL TNM-A stock solution was added to the medium to obtain G1 solid plates with different concentrations of TNM-A (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, or 8.0\\xa0mg/L). The spore suspension of each strain was adjusted to 1.0\\u2009×\\u2009108/mL, and then 100 µL spores were spread onto each G1 solid plates. After incubation at 30\\xa0°C for 3‒4 days, growth of each strain was observed and the number of single colonies was counted. Fermentation production and HPLC analysis of TNMs Briefly, 50 µL of spore suspension was inoculated into 50 mL TSB medium and cultivated at 220\\xa0rpm and 30\\xa0°C for 36\\xa0h. Then, 3 mL (6% v/v) of each suspension was transferred into 50 mL of OP medium and cultivated under the same conditions for seven days. The collected mycelia and resins were ultrasonically treated with a total of 50 mL methanol. The combined extracts were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis on a Waters E2695 HPLC system equipped with a PDA detector and a Welch Ultimate AQ-C18 column (5\\xa0μm, 250\\u2009×\\u20094.6\\xa0mm, Welch Materials Inc., Shanghai, China). The mobile phase consisted of A (H2O) and B (CH3CN) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A gradient program (90% A for 1\\xa0min; 90% A to 5% A for 17\\xa0min; 5% A for 2\\xa0min; 5% A to 90% A for 3\\xa0min, followed by 90% A for 2\\xa0min) was applied to detect TNM-A and TNM-D at 540\\xa0nm. Scaled-up production of TNMs in a 30\\xa0L fermenter Scaled-up production of TNMs was performed in a T&J C-type 30\\xa0L fermenter (T&J Bioengineering Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Briefly, 50 µL spore suspension was inoculated into 50\\xa0ml TSB medium and cultured at 30\\xa0°C for 36\\xa0h. Subsequently, 5 mL primary seeds were inoculated into 500 mL TSB medium and cultured at 30\\xa0°C for an additional 24\\xa0h. Then 1.5\\xa0L of seeds was transferred into a 30-L fermenter containing 25\\xa0L of OP medium for the fermentation. The stirrer speed (100‒300\\xa0rpm), aeration rate (350\\xa0L/h), and air pressure (0.02‒0.04\\xa0MPa) were coordinated to maintain 40%∼60% dissolved oxygen (DO) in the fermentation broth. At the end of the exponential growth phase, the pH of the broth was adjusted to approximately 8.0 automatically by adding 50\\xa0g/L of acidic soluble starch solution (pH 1.0, adjusted using HCl). Samples were periodically collected and analyzed to monitor the yield of TNMs until the end of fermentation. Isolation, structural characterization, and cytotoxicity evaluation of TNM-W The resins were recovered from 25\\xa0L fermentation broth containing S1021 using a 60-mesh stainless sieve filter (diameter 0.125\\xa0mm) and then ultrasonically extracted with 1\\xa0L methanol four times (10\\xa0min each). The combined extracts were concentrated to obtain a brown-black crude extract, which was then resuspended in 500 mL pure H2O and extracted again with 500 mL ethyl acetate (EA) three times. The EA extracts were evaporated, redissolved in 5 mL methanol, and purified using a CombiFlash RF200 preparative chromatography system (Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a Welch AQ-C18 flash column (20–40\\xa0μm, 80\\xa0g). Using a linear gradient from 10% methanol in H2O to 90% methanol in H2O at a flow rate of 10 mL/min, the fractions containing the target product TNM-W were combined and dried in vacuo. The resulting crude product was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography by eluting with methanol. The collected fractions were further purified using semipreparative HPLC to yield 4.7\\xa0mg of pure TNM-W. The structure of TNM-W was characterized by spectral analyses, including high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). To assess the cytotoxicity of TNM-W, the A549, KPL-4, Jurkat, and Caco-2 tumor cell lines were selected using TNM-A as a reference. Briefly, A549 and KPL-4 cells were cultured in DMEM, whereas Jurkat and Caco-2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640. Each cell line was seeded in 96-well plates (4\\u2009×\\u2009103 cells per well), cultivated for 24\\xa0h, and then treated with different concentrations (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, or 50 nM) of TNM-W or TNM-A (100 µL media per well). After 72\\xa0h of incubation, cell viability was measured using a CCK-8 assay to determine the corresponding IC50 values. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Statistical analysis All fermentation experiments were performed at least in triplicate. At least three independent experiments were performed for each quantification. All data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Primer 5.0 and presented as mean\\u2009±\\u2009SD. Significant difference analysis was performed using Student’s t-test. The significance level was set at P\\u2009<\\u20090.05 (*P\\u2009<\\u20090.05 was significant difference, **P\\u2009<\\u20090.01 and ***P\\u2009<\\u20090.001 were highly significant difference). Two-group comparisons were performed using Student’s t-test. All tests utilized the two-tailed methodology.',\n",

MM was supplemented with 10 mM uridine, 10 mM uracil, and 4 mM L-arginine when necessary. P. brevicompactum IBT 23078 was grown on Czapek yeast autolysate (CYA) agar at 25°C. CYA: 5.0 g/l Yeast extract (Difco); 15 g/l agar; 35 g/l Czapek Dox broth (Difco); 10 mg/l ZnSO4·7H2O; 5 mg/l CuSO4·5H2O. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.5 by using NaOH/HCl. Generating expression construct Amplification of DNA by PCR was performed using proof-reading PfuTurbo® Cx Hotstart polymerase (Stratagene) in 50 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixtures were heated to 95°C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 3 min. A fragment containing the fungal selection marker argB was amplified from the expression vector pU1111 [18] with primers BGHA71 and BGHA72 and cloned into MfeI/SbfI digested expression vector pU0002 [18] resulting in construct pHC1.

A. nidulans strain construction Protoplasting and gene-targeting procedures were performed as described previously [21,22]. 5 μg pHC3 was digested with NotI to liberate the gene targeting substrate, which was used for transformation of NID3 [23]. Transformants containing the desired gene targeting event were verified by PCR with primer-pairs BGHA98/BGHA256HC and BGHA255HC/BGHA225 using Taq-polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich) on genomic DNA obtained from streak purified transformants extracted using the FastDNA® SPIN for Soil Kit (MP Biomedicals, LLC). MPA treatment of fungi Spores from A. nidulans NID191 and A. nidulans NID495 were harvested. 10-fold dilution series was performed on freshly made MM-plates with 0, 5, 25, 100, 200 μg MPA/ml (Sigma). All plates contained 0.8% (v/v) methanol. Relative growth of the strains was assessed by visual inspection. Degenerate PCR An alignment with the DNA sequence (including introns) of the genes encoding P. brevicompactum IMPDH-B, A. nidulans IMPDH-A, P. chrysogenum IMPDH-A, P. chrysogenum IMPDH-B and Aspergillus fumigatus IMPDH-A was created by using ClustalW [24]. The ClustalW algorithm was accessed from the CLC DNA workbench 5 (CLC bio, http://www.clcbio.com/) with the following parameters: 'gap open cost = 20.0', 'gap extension cost = 1.0', and 'end gap cost = free'. The alignment was used to design degenerate primers to amplify either IMPDH-A like genes (BGHA236HC/BGHA246HC) or IMPDH-B like genes (BGHA240 HC/BGHA241 HC). The primer-set BGHA343/BGHA344 was used to amplify the β-tubulin sequence. Genomic DNA from P. brevicompactum IBT 23078 and four other fungi from Penicillium subgenus Penicillium were extracted using the FastDNA® SPIN for Soil Kit (MP Biomedicals, LLC). Touch-down PCR was carried out using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and the following program. An initial denaturation cycle at 98°C for 2 min; followed by 35 cycles at 98°C for 30 s, an annealing step ranging from 61°C (first cycle) to 54°C (last cycle) for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 45 s. PCR mixture was made according to the manufacture's instructions. PCR products generated by degenerate PCR were purified from agarose gels using illustra™ DNA and Gel band purification kit (GE Healthcare). Sequencing of purified PCR products was performed by StarSeq (Germany). Cladistic analysis BLASTx search was performed with standard settings: 'blastp algorithm', 'expect threshold = 10', 'word size = 3', 'max matches in query range = 0', 'matrix = BLOSUM62', 'gap open cost = 11', 'gap extension cost = 1', and no filters were used. Alignment of DNA coding regions were performed with ClustalW [24] as implemented in the CLC DNA workbench 5 (CLC bio, http://www.clcbio.com/) and by using the following parameters: 'gap open cost = 20.0', 'gap extension cost = 1.0', and 'end gap cost = free'.

The\\nfinal ensemble of 20 models and NMR resonance assignments were deposited\\nto the Protein Data Bank (PDB: 2LUZ). Resistance Assays In vivo resistance\\nassays were performed using overnight cultures of the tested strain\\ndiluted to OD600 ∼ 0.1 in molten LB agar supplemented\\nwith final concentration of 30 μg mL–1 kanamycin\\nand 100 μM of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside\\n(IPTG). The mixture was poured into Petri dishes and allowed to solidify.\\nA stock solution of 1 was prepared in methanol at a concentration\\nof 1 mg mL–1 and serial dilutions were prepared\\nsuch that the final concentrations tested ranged from 0.1 to 10 μg\\nμL–1. These were applied to sterile discs\\nsuch that the final quantities of 1 on the discs were\\n1 ng, 10 ng, 50 ng, 100 ng, 1 μg, and 10 μg. The disks\\nwere allowed to air-dry, and applied aseptically to the plates. All\\nplates were incubated at 37 °C for 14 h. Protein Cleavage Assay Final concentration of 1 μM\\nof each protein in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 in the presence of 1 mol equiv\\nof 1 with and without 0.2 mM DTT in a final volume of\\n500 μL was allowed to incubate at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions\\nwere lyophilized and resuspended in 25 μL of 50 mM Tris, pH\\n8.0. Cleavage was analyzed by mixing with equal volume of 2×\\nsample buffer.

For antibiotic production analyses, strains were cultivated in 50 ml inoculum medium (R5) at 28°C in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks (with steel springs) on an orbital shaker (180 rpm). After three days of cultivation, 5, 10\\xa0or 50 ml preculture was inoculated into 50, 100\\xa0or 200 ml of production medium (Supplementary Table S1), respectively. Cultures were grown for 4, 7\\xa0or 10 days at 28°C in 500 ml or 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks (with steel springs) on an orbital shaker (180 rpm). Bacillus subtilis bioassay Antibiotic activity was analyzed in agar plug diffusion assays using Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051 as a test organism. Agar plugs of well-grown cultures of actinomycetes strains were placed on a B. subtilis test plate. In total, 5 μl of apramycin (50 μg/ml; Sigma) was applied as a positive control on filter discs. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C and antibiotic activity was determined by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zone around the agar plugs and filter discs, respectively. Target-specific bioreporter assay Impairment of protein synthesis, more specifically the occurrence of translation arrest, was determined using the bioreporter strain B. subtilis 1S34 PbmrC-lacZ and agar-plug reporter assays were carried out as reported previously (5). Briefly, actinomycetes strains were cultivated for 7–10 days at 28°C on the indicated agar plates. Then, grown agar plugs of the well-grown strains were transferred to an empty petri dish before embedding them in B. subtilis 1S34 PbmrC-lacZ-containing soft agar. The agar was supplemented 150 μg/ml X-Gal (Thermo Scientific), that gives blue colorization in plates after promoter induction. Extracts or purified compounds were directly spotted on solidified soft agar plates containing B. subtilis 1S34 PbmrC-lacZ. Antibiotic discs containing 10 μg of chloramphenicol (Oxoid) were used as a positive control. Agar plates were analyzed for promoter induction after overnight incubation at 37°C. PbmrC induction was indicated by a blue halo surrounding the zone of inhibition of the respective test sample. Genomic DNA isolation and sequencing Isolation of genomic DNA and genome sequencing of the strains Tü 2975, Tü 3180, Tü 6340 and KNN 49.3e was performed as described in Hennrich et\\xa0al.\\xa0(33) and for strains Tü 2108 and A 4/2 as described in Zecher et\\xa0al.\\xa0(34). Genome sequence-specific information is listed in Supplementary Table S2. Type Strain Genome Server (TYGS) The phylogenomic analysis of selected strains was carried out with the Type (Strain) Genome Server (TYGS) v. 1.0, a free bioinformatics tool for whole-genome-based taxonomic analysis (35). Phylogenetic classification using TYGS is based on a genome database that contains the genomic, taxonomic, and nomenclatural data of all currently available type strains. The database is constantly updated (https://tygs.dsmz.de/). The TYGS platform allows phylogenetic analyses based on the full-length genome sequence of the strain of interest, which is compared with a database of type strain genomes. Thereby, TYGS provides information on the similarity of the strain to its nearest related type strain with the help of digital DNA:DNA hybridization (dDDH) values calculated by the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC) 2.1 (http://ggdc.dsmz.de) (36) and determines differences in genomic G\\xa0+\\xa0C contents. ARTS analysis The Antibiotic Resistance Target Seeker (ARTS) web tool v. 2.0 (21) was used to screen for potential self-resistance genes in genome sequences of natural compound producers. Genome sequences or accession numbers were submitted to the ARTS web-tool. The reference set was selected for Actinobacteria and the exploration mode was used. For all analyses, default settings were used. AntiSMASH analysis The antiSMASH web tool v. 6.0 (15) was used to analyze whole genome sequences for the presence of BGCs. Gene cluster similarity is displayed in % and indicates the number of genes similar to a known cluster. Genes are similar if a BLAST alignment yields an e-value\\xa0<1\\xa0×\\xa010–5 and if sequence identity is\\xa0>30%. In addition, the shortest alignment must encompass\\xa0>25% of the sequence. If all genes of a known cluster can be found in the query cluster, the sequence similarity is 100%. Similarity decreases if fewer genes of the known cluster can be found in the query cluster (37). Default settings were used for all analyses. In vitro transcription/translation (ivTT) assay The in vitro transcription/translation (ivTT) assay was performed as reported previously (31). Briefly, an S12 extract was prepared from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and mixed with nucleotides and amino acids as substrates for the transcription and translation process. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate was added as an energy supply and pET28-egfp as reporter plasmid. In total, 85 μl of 2.5× ivTT buffer, 60 μl of the S12 extract, 20 μl of an amino acid mixture (2 mM each of all 20 proteinogenic amino acids), and 20 μl of an energy mixture (1.2 mM AMP, 0.85 mM each of CMP, GMP, and UMP, 0.5 mM IPTG, 34 mg/ml l-5-formyl-THF\\xa0and 33 mM fructose-1,6- bisphosphate) served as the master mix for one sample of the ivTT assay (31). To test the actinomycetes culture extracts for translation inhibition, 30 μl of methanolic extracts were added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 30 min at 37°C to evaporate the methanolic solvent. The master mix and 10 μl of the reporter plasmid pET28-egfp (300 ng/μl) were added to each well to a final volume of 100 μl, thereby starting the reaction. All measurements were performed in triplicate using the same preparation of E. coli S12 extract. As positive controls, 5 μl of tetracycline (15 mg/ml; Sigma) or 5 μl of apramycin (50 mg/ml; Sigma) were used. The assay was incubated for approximately 2 h at 37°C. Fluorescence deriving from eGFP expression was measured at 485/520 nm excitation/emission with a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro device and analyzed with the i-control™ Microplate Reader Software 1.11 (Tecan). Compound extraction from actinomycetes cultures After cultivation of actinomycetes strains for 1–10 days in production medium, 5 or 50 ml of culture were extracted with 5, or 50 ml ethyl acetate, respectively, for 30 min at room temperature. Ethyl acetate samples were evaporated in vacuo completely and then redissolved in 0.25 or 1.25 ml of methanol, respectively. Methanolic extracts were used for bioassays and high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) analysis, were stored at 4°C or frozen at −20°C for later analysis. As controls, pure media extracts were prepared at a ratio of 1:1 media/ethyl acetate. Semi-preparative purification by HPLC For compound isolation, semi-preparative HPLC was carried out with an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). A sample volume of 100 μl was injected at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min on a Luna C18 column (5 μm, 100 Å, 4.6 mm × 250 mm) and a linear gradient from 5% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 100% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 25 min\\xa0at 25°C. 1.5 ml volume of each fraction was collected time based every minute. HPLC–MS analysis HPLC analyses were performed as described previously with a HP1090M system and ChemStation 3D software rev. A.08.03 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) on a Nucleosil C18 column (5 mm, 125 mm × 3 mm) fitted with a precolumn (20\\xa0×\\xa03 mm) and with a flow rate of 850 μl/min (38). HPLC–MS was performed with an Agilent 1200 series chromatography system (binary pump, high performance autosampler, DAD-detector) coupled to a LC/MSD Ultra Trap System XCT 6330 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) (38). Samples were injected onto a Nucleosil 100 C18 column (3 μm, 100\\xa0×\\xa02 mm) fitted with a precolumn (3 μm, 10\\xa0×\\xa02 mm) at a flow rate of 400 μl/min and a linear gradient from 10% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 100% solvent B (0.06% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 15 min\\xa0at 40°C. For the dereplication process, the UV-DAD spectra of the extracts/fractions were analyzed first for relevant signals. For this purpose, the peaks in the HPLC chromatogram were individually analyzed by comparing the chromatogram with an in-house HPLC–UV–Vis database (39). Peaks showing a coincident UV–Vis entry with a possible PSI substance were followed up. The masses of the possible PSI compounds were compared with the Dictionary of Natural Products as an external database (40). A substance was classified as ‘clearly identified’, if the match with the internal database and the external database confirmed the UV–Vis and MS criteria.\",\n",
       " \"Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditions All strains and plasmids used in this study are detailed in Table S1. All mutants constructed in S. marcescens Db10 were in-frame deletion mutants, generated by allelic exchange as described previously (Murdoch et al., 2011). Streptomycin-resistant derivatives were generated by phage ϕIF3-mediated transduction of the resistance allele from S. marcescens Db11 (Petty et al., 2006). Plasmids for constitutive expression of proteins in S. marcescens were derived from pSUPROM, plasmids for arabinose-inducible protein expression were derived from pBAD18-Kn, and derivatives of the pET15b-TEV plasmid were generated for protein overexpression and purification. S. marcescens was grown at 30°C in LB (10 g l−1 tryptone, 5 g l−1 yeast extract, 10 g l−1 NaCl, with 1.5 g l−1 agar for solid media) or minimal media (40 mM K2HPO4, 15 mM KH2PO4, 0.1% (NH4)2SO4, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 0.2% glucose) and E. coli was normally grown at 37°C in LB or M9 minimal media (M9). M9 (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) contained 0.5% glycerol (plus stated concentrations of arabinose and glucose as required). Growth analyses were performed in 96-well plates in a BioTek Synergy platereader. When required, media were supplemented with antibiotics: ampicillin (Ap) 100 μg ml−1, kanamycin (Kn) 100 μg ml−1, streptomycin (Sm) 100 μg ml−1, chloramphenicol (Cm) 25 μg ml−1; to maintain repression of proteins expressed from pBAD18-Kn, 0.5% glucose was added to the media for cloning and maintenance. Antibacterial competition/co-culture assays These were based on the assay described previously (Murdoch et al., 2011). In brief, the attacker strain and target strain (both at OD600 0.5) were mixed at an initial ratio of 1:1 attacker : target, co-cultured on solid LB for 7.5 h at 30°C and then the surviving target cells enumerated by serial dilution and viable counts on streptomycin-containing media. The target strain was always the streptomycin-resistant version of the mutant in question (Table S1). Statistical significance testing was performed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post test (GraphPad Prism software). Bioinformatic identification of homologues of Rap and Ssp proteins and determination of their genetic contexts utilized the blast servers and sequence databases at the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Immunodetection of secreted proteins Anti-Hcp immunoblots were performed as described (Murdoch et al., 2011). For detection of Ssp1 and Ssp2, cellular and secreted fractions were prepared from 25 ml of culture grown for 7 h in LB. Secreted proteins were precipitated using 50:50 chloroform : methanol followed by methanol wash and resuspension in 2× gel sample buffer (Murdoch et al., 2011). Cellular samples were prepared by sonicating harvested cells in 20 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 and isolating the soluble fraction by centrifugation. Anti-Ssp1 and anti-Ssp2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised to the purified proteins (Eurogentec, Belgium) and used at 1:1000; peroxidase-conjugated secondary (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used at 1:10 000. Anti-RNAP β (Neoclone, USA) was used at 1:20 000, with anti-mouse secondary (Roche) at 1:10 000. In all cases, protein from the same number of cells was loaded in the secreted versus the cellular samples. Localization of Rap-HA proteins Fractionation was performed using a cold osmotic shock procedure. Following growth of cultures for 5 h in LB, Tris·HCl pH 7.8 was added to 5 ml of cells to a final concentration of 50 mM and the cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, then recovered by centrifugation and washed once in LB. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 40% sucrose, 30 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA and incubated for 10 min at 30°C. One hundred microlitres of this fraction (‘whole cell’) was removed for analysis. Remaining cells were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 900 μl of ice-cold water and incubated on ice for 10 min, resulting in the release of the periplasm. After centrifugation, 100 μl of the supernatant (‘periplasm’ fraction) was retained for analysis. The pellet, containing the ‘cytoplasm + membranes’ fraction, was resuspended in 900 μl of 50 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.8 and 100 μl retained for analysis. Equivalent amounts, on a per cell basis, of each fraction in each strain were assayed. Anti-RNAP β was used as above, anti-MBP (NEB) was used at 1:10 000 and anti-HA (Roche) was used at 1:6000, all with anti-mouse secondary as above. Microscopic analysis of colony and cell morphology Overnight cultures were normalized to OD600 0.5, diluted 10−2 (culture spots) or to obtain single colonies, 10 μl spotted onto solid media and grown for 24 or 48 h. Macroscopic morphology of culture spots and single colonies were recorded using a Zeiss MZ16FA Stereo Microscope with a Leica DFC350 FX camera and Leica AF6000 software. Microscopic analysis of single cells taken from spots grown on solid media as above was performed by Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy using an Axioskop 2 mot plus (Zeiss) with a SPOT RT KE camera and spot software (Diagnostic Instruments). Protein purification and in vitro analysis A full description of protein purification is provided in the Supporting information. In brief, proteins were overproduced in E. coli with a TEV protease-cleavable His6 tag and isolated by Ni2+ affinity purification. If required, the His6 tag was cleaved using TEV protease and the protein re-isolated by reverse Ni2+ chromatography. A final SEC step was then always performed. For SEC analysis of complex formation, His6-tagged proteins (10 nmol each) in 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl were separated on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column, calibrated using molecular weight standards (GE Healthcare). Quantitative SYPRO Orange staining was performed as described (Rickman et al., 2004), with image analysis using ImageJ. Molar ratios were the mean of at least four quantifications. ITC was performed in 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl at 30°C in a MicroCal iTC200 calorimeter. The sample cell contained 6 μM Rap1a dimer or Rap2a dimer and the syringe contained 120 μM Ssp1 or Ssp2. Titrations consisted of 30 × 8 μl injections of Ssp into Rap (or into buffer alone as control). Data analysis was performed with the Origin software provided (MicroCal). For affinity isolation of Ssp1 and Ssp2, 10 μg of His6-tagged Rap protein was immobilized on magnetic Ni2+ beads (Qiagen), incubated for 1 h with culture supernatant (after 7 h growth in LB), beads washed and bound proteins eluted by the addition of gel sample buffer. Identified proteins were excised from the Coomassie- (Ssp2) or Silver- (Ssp1) stained gel and identified by mass spectrometry. Crystallographic analyses Well-ordered trigonal and orthorhombic crystals of Rap1b and Rap2b, respectively, were obtained. The asymmetric unit for Rap1b consisted of a single subunit, while Rap2b displayed two dimers in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were recorded in-house and experimental phases were derived by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction measurements (Micossi et al., 2002), exploiting the signal from endogenous S atoms and I− ions that had been added by soaking. The electron density maps were of high quality, and the models were completed, then refined to high resolution using standard methods (Dawson et al., 2008). Full crystallographic details are provided in the Supporting information and Table 1. Atomic co-ordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes 4AX2 (Rap1b) and 4B6I (Rap2b).\",\n",
       " 'Reagents. DNA oligonucleotides (see Table\\xa0S4 in the supplemental material) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Escherichia coli K-12 wild-type strain was purchased from the Keio E. coli knockout collection (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare). HED (Streptomyces griseoruber ATCC 23919) was obtained from the National Cancer Institute’s Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI DTP) Open Compound Repository (NSC 70929). Trioxacarcin A (TXNA) was isolated from Streptomyces bottropensis NRRL 12051 as described previously (56). AZB was prepared from organic extract of Streptomyces sahachiroi (ATCC 33158) as in reference 31. NM8 compound was synthesized and purified by the Vanderbilt Molecular Design and Synthesis Center (31). AlkA, AlkC, AlkD, AlkZ, LldU1/5, TxnU2/4, and YcaQ were purified as described previously (30, 31, 52, 56, 74, 75). Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and all enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (NEB). Cellular strains, plasmids, and oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study. All oligonucleotides were dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) to 200 μM, and the DNA was stored at −20°C (stored in the dark for the Cy5/FAM oligonucleotides). The underlined nucleotide in the 7mG_Top, HED_Top, TXNA_Top, AZB_Top/_Bottom, and NM8_Top/_Bottom oligonucleotides is the site of the N7-alkylguanine lesion. PCR was performed with a primer concentration of 500 nM. Download Table\\xa0S4, XLSX file, 0.01 MB. Taxonomy and phylogeny of Streptomyces HTH_42 proteins. To identify HTH_42 proteins in Streptomyces, the protein sequences for YcaQ (GenBank accession number QHB65847.1) and AlkZ (GenBank accession number ABY83174.1) were used for tBLASTn and BLASTp searches (BLAST+ v2.11.0) against all Streptomyces genomes (taxid:1883). Searches were run with the BLOSUM62 matrix, 1,000 maximum target sequences, and 0.05 threshold using an e-value and identity cutoff of 10−4 and 25%, respectively. All hits were verified for the presence of the (H/Q)Φ(D/Q) catalytic motif, during which the (H/Q)Φ(S/T)(D/E) (AZL2) variant was identified. Truncated genes, poor-sequence-quality genes, and pseudogenes were eliminated. Additional sequences were obtained by searching the Pfam database v33.1 (76) for Streptomyces HTH_42 superfamily members (PF06224). Sequences from Pfam were sorted according to their domain classes (see Fig.\\xa0S1A in the supplemental material), and only sequences from class 1 with >75% coverage were included. Protein sequences were aligned using EMBL-EBI Clustal OmegaW or MAFFT v7 using default parameters (77, 78). The evolutionary history of YQL/AZL sequences was reconstructed using IQTREE2 with default settings (79), and the phylogenetic tree was assembled with the Interactive Tree of Life (v5) phylogeny display tool (80). Sequence logos were generated with WebLogo v2.8.2 (81). The copy number frequency and coincidence of YQL/AZL in the same genome was determined by manually counting the number and identity of homologs in each species. A list of all YQL/AZL/AZL2 proteins and Streptomyces genomes analyzed in this study can be found in Table\\xa0S1. Identification of AZL proteins in known biosynthetic gene clusters. To find AZL proteins in verified and/or published BGCs, we searched MIBiG v2.0 for the AZB BGC (BGC0000960) from S. sahachiroi (27, 82), followed by an iterative search using the MIBiG Hits function until no more hits were obtained. The homologs TxnU2 and TxnU4 were identified from the initial BLAST search within the deposited NCBI trioxacarcin BGC sequence (83). The homolog within the aclacinomycin BGC was also identified in the initial BLAST search as appearing in proximity to aclacinomycin biosynthesis genes. Closer inspection of the published sequence for the aclacinomycin BGC (GenBank accession number AB008466.1) revealed an AZL protein (Orf1) located immediately 3′ of the cluster (84). A detailed list of the AZL proteins in known BGCs can be found in Table\\xa0S3. Identification of AZL proteins in uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters. To determine the physical distance in base pairs between the genomic coordinates of AZL proteins and those of BGCs present in the genome assemblies of Streptomyces (average number of scaffolds, 96.30; minimum, 1; maximum, 1,956), we first predicted the BGCs in each genome using antiSMASH v5.1.0 (38) with the taxon parameter set to bacteria. Using the BGC sequences identified from antiSMASH and AZL sequences, a custom python script using Biopython (85) determined the shortest base pair distance between the physical location of the YQL/AZL gene and the location of the nearest BGC on the same scaffold (less than 2 Mbp away). To be considered within a BGC, the homolog had to be observed within 5 genes or 2\\u2009kb of the nearest cluster. Known Cluster BLAST was performed within antiSMASH to determine the BGC most similar to the unknown clusters, and the result with the highest percentage of similar genes was recorded as the most similar cluster. A detailed list of the genome information, cluster identifiers (IDs), and closest 3′ and/or 5′ BGC can be found in Table\\xa0S2. Gene ontology analysis. To identify GO terms for nearest neighbors identified through BLAST, Pfam, and MIBiG searches, we randomly chose 40 homologs each of AZL inside BGCs, AZL outside BGCs, and YQL, which represent ∼10% of the sequences for each. Amino acid sequences for the five genes on both sides of the YQL/AZL genes were downloaded from the NCBI database, for a total of 400 neighbors for each of the three classes. Cellular functions of any already annotated genes in the NCBI database were identified and recorded. The downloaded sequences were then run through the GhostKOALA (v2.2) and eggNOG (v5.0) GO annotation databases (86, 87). After known GO terms for all gene neighbors were identified, proteins were categorized by biological processes and molecular functions, and the values for these terms were used to create the GO term distributions. Proteins that had multiple GO terms associated with them were counted into each class of terms. A list of all proteins and their annotated GO terms can be found in Tables S5 and S6.

Genes encoding Streptomyces caeruleatus AZL2, Streptomyces griseoruber HedH4, Thermomonospora curvata YQL, and Thermobifida fusca YQL were codon optimized and synthesized by GenScript and cloned into pBG102. The N-terminal His6-SUMO fusion proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli Tuner(DE3) cells at 16°C for 18\\u2009h in LB medium supplemented with 30\\u2009μg/mL kanamycin and 50\\u2009μM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were lysed by sonication and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 45,000\\u2009×\\u2009g at 4°C for 30\\u2009min. Clarified lysate was passed over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose equilibrated in buffer A (50\\u2009mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 500\\u2009mM NaCl, 25\\u2009mM imidazole, and 10% [vol/vol] glycerol) and protein eluted in 250\\u2009mM imidazole-buffer A. Protein fractions were pooled and supplemented with 0.1\\u2009mM EDTA and 1\\u2009mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) before incubation with 0.5\\u2009mg rhinovirus 3C protease (PreScission) at 4°C overnight. Cleaved protein was diluted 10-fold in buffer B (50\\u2009mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 10% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1\\u2009mM TCEP, and 0.1\\u2009mM EDTA) and purified by heparin Sepharose using a 0 to 1 M NaCl-buffer B linear gradient. Fractions were pooled and passed over Ni-NTA agarose in buffer A, concentrated and filtered, and buffer exchanged into buffer C (20\\u2009mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 100\\u2009mM NaCl, 5% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1\\u2009mM TCEP, and 0.1\\u2009mM EDTA). Protein was concentrated to 4\\u2009mg/mL, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Mutant protein expression vectors were generated using the Q5 mutagenesis kit (New England BioLabs), and proteins were overexpressed and purified the same as the wild type. DNA glycosylase activity. DNA substrates containing a single N7-methyl-2′-deoxyguanosine lesion and a 5′-Cy5 fluorophore were prepared as described previously (88). AZB- and NM8-ICL substrates were generated and purified as in reference 31. DNA substrates containing a single HED-guanosine or trioxacarcin A (TXNA)-guanosine adduct were prepared by annealing 5′-Cy5-labeled DNA containing the target sequence to the complementary unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotide (Table\\xa0S4). HED and TXNA were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 5\\u2009mM, and 100\\u2009μM DNA was incubated with 200\\u2009μM HED or TXNA in 10% methanol and 20% DMSO at 4°C on ice in the dark for 24\\u2009h. Unreacted drug was removed using an Illustra G-25 spin column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in TE buffer (10\\u2009mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1\\u2009mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the DNA was stored at −80°C. In each glycosylase reaction, 1\\u2009μM enzyme was incubated with 50\\u2009nM DNA in glycosylase buffer (50\\u2009mM HEPES, pH 8.5, 100\\u2009mM KCl, 1\\u2009mM EDTA, and 10% [vol/vol] glycerol) at 25°C. At various time points, 4-μL aliquots were added to 1\\u2009μL of 1 M NaOH and heated at 70°C for 2\\u2009min. Samples were denatured at 70°C for 5\\u2009min in 5\\u2009mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 80% (wt/vol) formamide, and 1\\u2009mg/mL blue dextran prior to electrophoresis on a 20% (wt/vol) acrylamide–8 M urea sequencing gel at 40 W for 1\\u2009h in 0.5×\\u2009TBE buffer (45\\u2009mM Tris, 45\\u2009mM borate, and 1\\u2009mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Gels were imaged on a Typhoon Trio variable-mode imager (GE Healthcare) using 633-nm excitation/670-nm emission fluorescence for Cy5, and bands were quantified with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). All excision assays were performed in triplicate. HPLC-MS analysis of HED and HED-guanine. HPLC was performed on an Agilent Series 1100 system equipped with an analytical SymmetryShield RP-C18 column (3.5\\u2009μm, 4.6\\u2009mm\\u2009by\\u20097.5\\u2009mm, 100-Å pore size) and using a linear gradient from 90% buffer A (10\\u2009mM ammonium formate)–10% buffer B (100% methanol) to 100% B over 40\\u2009min and a flow rate of 0.4\\u2009mL/min. HED was diluted to 50\\u2009μM in 10% methanol and stored on ice prior to HPLC injection. To analyze the product of HedH4 activity, HED-DNA was diluted to 10\\u2009μM in glycosylase buffer and reacted with 50\\u2009μM HedH4 for 1\\u2009h at room temperature before injection. Mass spectrometry was performed with an LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in positive ion mode from 300 to 1,000 m/z. Cellular assays for HED resistance. The hedH4 wild-type gene was subcloned from pBG102 into pSF-OXB1 using NcoI and XbaI restriction sites. The pSF-OXB1 vector contains a kanamycin resistance gene and allows for constitutive low-level expression from a modified AraBAD promoter. pSF-OXB1 and HedH4/pSF-OXB1 were transformed into E. coli K-12 cells. Cloning of hedH4 was confirmed by sequencing, restriction digest using NcoI-HF/XbaI (Fig. S4C), and colony PCR of K-12 transformants using the HedH4 NcoI and XbaI primers (Fig. S4D, Table\\xa0S4). Cultures were grown at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with 30\\u2009μg/mL Kan. Growth curves were generated by diluting overnight cultures to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.01 in LB/Kan supplemented with 0\\u2009nM to 100\\u2009μM HED in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. The plate was incubated at 30°C with shaking for 24\\u2009h, and cell density was measured at 600\\u2009nm every 20\\u2009min using a Bio-Tek Synergy 2 microplate reader. IC50 values were determined from a fit to the equation lag time = minlag + (maxlag − minlag)/[1 + (IC50/[HED])h], where h is the Hill slope. Growth experiments were performed in triplicate. E. coli survival curves after HED treatment were performed using a colony dilution assay. A saturated overnight LB/Kan culture from a single colony was diluted to an OD600 of 0.01 in 1\\u2009mL fresh LB/Kan medium and grown to an OD600 of 0.6 at 37°C. The cells were treated with various concentrations of HED for 1\\u2009h at 37°C. Treated cells were transferred to fresh LB/Kan medium and serially diluted by 10−6 in LB/Kan medium, and 100\\u2009μL of diluted cells was plated on LB/Kan agar plates and grown at 37°C overnight. Colonies were counted the next morning and the number of CFU/mL culture was determined. The percent survival was calculated as CFU/mL (treated) divided by CFU/mL (untreated). Curves were plotted on a logarithmic scale and IC50 values determined by nonlinear regression fits to the data. Growth experiments were performed in triplicate.',\n",
       " 'Sample collection and deoxyribonucleic acid extraction Microbial samples were collected in three replicates from rhizosphere of M. oleifera plant grown naturally in the North Western region of Mecca district of Saudi Arabia near the red sea coast (21°12′17.8″N 39°31′26.4″E) and from surrounding bulk soil (Al-Eisawi and Al-Ruzayza, 2015). The selected three plants for the experiment are single-grown, have similar size and received no rainfall for > 3 months prior sample collection, while bulk soil samples were concurrently taken ≥ 10 m apart from the plants. For soil rhizospheric samples, plant lateral roots were first cut at ∼10–30 cm depth. Then, soil of a maximum of 1 cm apart from the root, not the soil that physically adheres to the root, was collected and immediately put in liquid nitrogen, transported to the lab, and stored at −20°C until use (Hurt et al., 2001). Whole genome shotgun sequencing and bioinformatics analysis Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNAs) of different soil samples were extracted using CTAB/SDS method, and purity and integrity were checked by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA concentration was adjusted to 10 ng/μl using dsDNA Assay kit (Life Technologies, United States). Then, 1 μg of each DNA sample was shipped to Novogene Co. (Singapore) for whole metagenome shotgun sequencing. Physical fractionation of DNAs followed by data pre-processing were done and low quality bases (Q-value ≤ 38) exceeding 40-bp threshold were trimmed, and reads with N nucleotides over 10-bp threshold were removed. Then, effective clean data were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform after library preparation using an Ultra DNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (NEB, United States). Generated data were assembled to recover scaffolds using MEGAHIT (K-mer = 55) and chimeras were removed as described (Karlsson et al., 2012; Mende et al., 2012; Oh et al., 2014). Unassembled reads of different samples were mixed together to generate NOVO_MIX scaffolds exploring the less-abundant genes of the different samples. Generated scaffolds were cut off at “N” to get N-free fragments (or scaftigs) (Mende et al., 2012; Nielsen et al., 2014). Then, clean data were mapped to assembled scaftigs using Soap 2.21, and effective scaftigs (found in > 2 samples) were further utilized. Gene prediction was carried out by MetaGeneMark (Nielsen et al., 2014) and predicted genes were dereplicated using Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT) (Li and Godzik, 2006; Fu et al., 2012). Then, non-redundant gene catalogs (nrGC) were constructed after removing redundancy using a greedy pairwise comparison (Li et al., 2014) and annotation was done using the binning reference-based classification method MEGAN (Huson et al., 2011, 2016). All unique open reading frames (ORFs) were subjected to Blastp against CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database)1 (e-value ≤ 1e–5) (Martínez et al., 2015) in order to identify and characterize ARGs. Then, relative abundance of different ARGs in unit ppm was estimated (Yang et al., 2013; Forsberg et al., 2014). ARGs were categorized to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) families (or metabolic processes) and resistance mechanisms were assigned as described (Liu and Pop, 2009). Based on abundance information of ARGs, heat map of abundance clustering for the top 30 highly abundant ARGs was drawn. Then, two circle charts were drawn to describe the overall proportion and distribution of the most redundant ARGs across the two soil types, on one hand, and the most redundant metabolic processes at the bacterial phylum level in ARO (antibiotic-resistant organisms) datasets, on the other hand. The first circle chart was divided into two parts of which the first refers to soil types (right side) and the second part refers to the most highly abundant ARGs (left side). The second chart was drawn to incorporate the most highly abundant bacterial phyla in terms of ARGs (right side) and the metabolic processes related to these highly abundant ARGs (left side). Stretches of different colors in the right side of inner circle refer to sum of relative abundance of all ARGs per sample in the first circus and sum of relative abundance of all metabolic processes per bacterial phylum in the second circus. While, color stretches in the left side refer to sum of relative abundance of all samples per ARG in the first circus and all bacterial phyla per metabolic process in the second circus. Colors in the right side of outer circle refer to detailed relative abundance of different ARGs per sample in the first circus and detailed relative abundance of different metabolic processes or AMR gene families per bacterial phylum in the second circus. While, colors in the left side refer to detailed relative abundance of different samples per ARG in the first circus and detailed relative abundance different bacterial phyla per metabolic process in the second circus. Validation of selected highly abundant antibiotic resistance genes via qPCR Total RNAs were isolated from samples gathered for each soil type using RNA PowerSoil® Total RNA isolation kit (Mo Bio, cat. no. 12866-25) following manufacturer instructions. DNA contamination was removed from RNA samples using RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) and eventually checked by PCR. Then, primers of four highly abundant ARGs in plant rhizosphere in addition to those of 16S rRNA of Bacillus subtilis, used as a house-keeping gene, were designed using Netprimer software2 following standard criteria (Supplementary Table 1). Expression level of the different ARGs was detected by qPCR using Agilent Mx3000P System (Agilent technology, United States). Maxima™ SYBR Green/ROX qPCR was done as previously described (Bahieldin et al., 2015). Similar amounts of RNAs of the two samples were used and calculations were made to detect the expression level of ARGs relative to that of the housekeeping gene.',\n",
       " 'Strains and plasmids. Aspergillus oryzae strain M-2-3, an arginine auxotroph, was obtained from Colin Lazarus (University of Bristol, UK). Monascus ruber strain M7 was previously described (15). Plasmids pEYA and pTAYAGSarg3P were propagated in Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) as the host. Gateway destination vectors were propagated in E. coli\\nccdB Survival 2 T1R cells (Invitrogen). Recombinant M. ruber and A. oryzae strains are listed in Table S1 (19). Primers used in plasmid construction are listed in Table S2 (19). Media and cultivation. E. coli was grown at 37°C in LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic. A. oryzae strains were routinely cultivated at 28°C in CMP (3.5% Czapek Dox broth, 2% maltose, 1% Polypepton) for 5\\u2009days with shaking at 200\\u2009rpm and were inoculated (1% [vol/vol]) from a preculture (a 100-ml overnight culture inoculated with 5\\u2009×\\u2009107 conidia/ml). M. ruber strains were cultured in PDB medium at 30°C with shaking at 200\\u2009rpm, and the mycelia were harvested after 12 to 15\\u2009days of cultivation. For cocultivation, M. ruber strains were first grown as a monoculture in 100\\u2009ml PDB at 30°C for 3 to 4\\u2009days with shaking at 200\\u2009rpm, and then 5 to 10\\u2009ml of a freshly prepared culture of the challenger fungi or bacteria was added. The coculture was further incubated at 30°C with shaking at 200\\u2009rpm for an additional 3 to 5\\u2009days. Challenger fungal cultures were prepared by culturing the appropriate strains in 100\\u2009ml PDB medium at 28°C for 2 to 4\\u2009days with shaking at 120\\u2009rpm. Mycelial pellets were dispersed by vortexing and resuspended in 100\\u2009ml fresh PDB. Staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in LB medium at 37°C for 24\\u2009h with shaking at 200\\u2009rpm. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Qiagen) from mycelial samples that were prefrozen and ground to a fine powder. The resulting RNA samples were checked for purity (optical density ratio at 260 and 290 nm [OD260/280] of 1.8 to 2.2) and integrity (observation of two sharp bands for the ribosomal RNAs [rRNA] of the large and the small ribosomal subunits, with the intensity of the larger band approximately twice that of the smaller band). cDNA synthesis was performed in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing approximately 1\\u2009μg of total RNA, using the PrimeScript RT master mix (TaKaRa) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. qRT-PCR was performed using 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 5.0\\u2009μl SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (1×, TaKaRa), 0.4\\u2009μl of each primer (400\\u2009nM each), 0.4\\u2009μl ROX reference dye, and 1.0\\u2009μl of cDNA sample. A two-step thermal profile (step 1, 95°C for 10 s, and step 2, 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 60°C for 25 s) was used on a 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Results were analyzed using the StepOne software (version 2.0; Applied Biosystems). The cycle number at which the fluorescence passed the cycle threshold (CT) was used for the quantitation of the expression level. Relative expression levels for each target cDNA were obtained by the 2−ΔΔCT method via normalization to β-actin (GenBank accession no. AJ417880), using the formula 2−(CT\\ntarget −\\nCT\\nactin). Controls with no added template were used to exclude the possibility that primer-dimer formation interfered with the calculations. Expression of biosynthetic genes in A. oryzae. The intron-free mrpigA polyketide synthase gene was amplified from M. ruber M7 cDNA as three overlapping fragments using primer pairs mrpigA-1-F/mrpigA-1-R, mrpigA-2-F/mrpigA-2-R, and mrpigA-3-F/mrpigA-3-R (Table S2 [19]). The resulting fragments were reassembled in the pEYA vector by homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741. The cloned mrpigA gene was then transferred to pTAYAGSarg3P by Gateway LR recombination (Invitrogen) to create pTAYAGSarg3P-mrpigA. In this vector, the mrpigA gene was under the control of the PamyB promoter and the TamyB terminator. Genes encoding tailoring enzymes were amplified from M. ruber M7 cDNA using primers (Table S2 [19]) that overlap the 3′ end of the appropriate promoter (Padh or Peno) or the 5′ end of the corresponding terminator (Tadh or Teno), respectively. The PCR products were cloned into pTAYAGSarg3P-mrpigA using the HiEff Clone One Step PCR cloning kit (Yeasen). After transformation of A. oryzae M-2-3 with the recombinant plasmids (Table S1 [19]), three to five independent isolates were evaluated for metabolite production for each recombinant strain. Protein extraction and purification. Genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes with an added N-terminal 6×His tag were cloned into the pTAYAGSarg3P vector and placed under the control of the PamyB promoter and the TamyB terminator. Plasmids were transformed into A. oryzae M-2-3 (Table S1 [19]). Recombinant A. oryzae strains were cultivated in CMP medium for 2\\u2009days with shaking at 200\\u2009rpm at 28°C and induced with 0.5% (wt/vol) maltose every day during continued growth for 3\\u2009days with shaking at 200\\u2009rpm at 28°C. Protein was purified as previous work reported with modifications (3). The mycelia were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by high-pressure homogenization with a French press in a buffer containing 50\\u2009mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Crude MrPigA protein extracts were filtered using a 0.22-μm cellulose nitrate membrane (Millipore) and then ultrafiltered (Millipore) to remove proteins with molecular weights less than 100\\u2009kDa. Crude protein extracts with MrPigC, MrPigH, or MrPigN were also clarified using a 0.22-μm cellulose nitrate membrane (Millipore), but the flowthrough fraction was collected during ultrafiltration (100\\u2009kDa cutoff; Millipore). The ultrafiltered protein extracts were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% to 90%) during overnight incubation at 4°C and then centrifuged, and the pellet was solubilized in 100\\u2009mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0). The resulting protein solution was clarified again by centrifugation, and the His-tagged enzymes were purified via Ni affinity chromatography (Thermo) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The eluate was dialyzed against 20\\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.0) with 50\\u2009mM NaCl and concentrated to greater than 1.0\\u2009mg/ml using a centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Protein deglycosylation. Five microliters of the purified protein sample (5 to 10\\u2009μg protein), 1.0\\u2009μl 10× glycoprotein denaturing buffer, and 4.0\\u2009μl water were mixed and then heated at 100°C for 10 min, followed by the addition of 2\\u2009μl 10× GlycoBuffer, 6.5\\u2009μl H2O, and 1.5\\u2009μl Endo H (NEB). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 1\\u2009h. In vitro enzymatic reactions. In general, substrates (1.5\\u2009mM each, final concentration) were dissolved in 150\\u2009μl HEPES buffer (50\\u2009mM, pH 7.0), and the reaction was started by adding 50\\u2009μl of the enzyme solution (10\\u2009μM, final concentration). Glycosylated enzymes were used for the reactions, as deglycosylated enzymes showed no improvements in their activities. After incubation at 30°C with shaking at 100\\u2009rpm for 30\\u2009min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 25\\u2009μl H2SO4 (1.0 M). Cosubstrates used for the MrPigA reaction were as follows (final concentrations): malonyl-CoA (10.0\\u2009mM), acetyl-CoA (3.0\\u2009mM), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM; 3.0\\u2009mM), NADPH (3.0\\u2009mM), and NADP (sodium salt, 3\\u2009mM). Reactions with MrPigA and MrPigN used cosubstrates as above. Reactions with MrPigC used NADPH (10\\u2009mM) as the cosubstrate. Enzymatic reactions with total protein extracts from M. ruber ΔmrpigC were performed as with MrPigC but with MrPigC replaced by the clarified lysate of the strain (50\\u2009μl). Reactions with MrPigH used NADPH (10\\u2009mM) as the cosubstrate and were conducted under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. For anaerobic reactions, nitrogen was bubbled through the buffer solution for 1 h after degassing under reduced pressure. The reaction mixture was carefully flushed with nitrogen and stirred for 30\\u2009min under a nitrogen atmosphere. For all reactions, the remaining substrate and the reaction product(s) were extracted with 200\\u2009μl of a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (7:3) three times, and the pooled organic phase was dried under a nitrogen stream, dissolved in 200\\u2009μl high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade methanol and analyzed by HPLC and NMR. Quantitative assays were repeated three times with three technical replicates each (n\\u2009=\\u20099). Qualitative assays were performed using three biological replicates. Extraction of metabolites. Mycelia of M. ruber strains were collected after cultivation for 12 to 14 days, while A. oryzae mycelia were harvested at day 5. Wet mycelia (100 g) were disrupted in a French press by high-pressure homogenization, acidified with 37% HCl to a pH less than 4.0, and extracted three times with 50\\u2009ml each of a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (7:3) by vigorous shaking for 1 h. The pooled organic fraction was dried on a rotary evaporator, and the crude extract was dissolved in 5\\u2009ml HPLC-grade methanol. Isolation of compounds. Compounds were isolated by HPLC on a Shimadzu autopurification system equipped with a supplementary L-10AP autosampler, an LC-6AD pump system, an SPD-M20A detector, and a Shim-pack C18 column (5.0\\u2009μm, 20 mm by 250\\u2009mm). The following gradient profile of solvents A and B was used at a column temperature of 30°C and at a flow rate of 20\\u2009ml/min: 0 to 5\\u2009min, 60% A; 5 to 25\\u2009min, 60% to 5% A; 25 to 30\\u2009min, 5% A; 30 to 35\\u2009min, 5% to 35% A; and 35 to 40\\u2009min, 50% A. The mobile phase solvent A was HPLC-grade water, and solvent B was HPLC-grade acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% formic acid. Detected peaks were collected in glass test tubes. The purified fractions were freeze-dried to completely remove the solvent. The purified compounds were subjected to HRMS/MS and NMR analyses. HPLC, HRMS, and NMR analyses. Analysis for metabolites was carried out using a Shimadzu HPLC equipped with an SPD-M20A photodiode array detector and a supplementary L-20A autosampler and managed by a LabSolutions LC Workstation (Shimadzu). The analytes were separated on an Inertsil ODS-3 C18 column (5.0\\u2009μm, 4.6 mm by 250 mm; Shimadzu) operating at 30°C, and compounds were detected at 280\\u2009nm. The mobile phase solvents A and B were water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.05% phosphoric acid.

       " 'Fermentation, isolation, and identification of the thiotetronates For analysis of thiolactomycin and Tü 3010 production, strains were cultured in liquid production medium for 4 days. The fermentation broth was adjusted to pH 3, shaken vigorously with an equal volume of ethyl acetate for 2 hours (37 °C, 250 rpm), then clarified by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator, the crude extract was dissolved in 600 μl of methanol, and clarified by centrifugation (12\\u2009000 × g, 10 min). LC-ESI-HRMS analysis of Tü 3010 was performed on LTQ XL Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Thermo Instruments HPLC system, operated in positive ion mode with electrospray ionization. HPLC separation was achieved using a Phenomenex C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) equilibrated with 20 mM ammonium acetate (A) and methanol (B), and was developed with the following program: 0–2 min, 90% A; 2–4 min, 90% A – 40% A; 4–15 min, 40% A – 20% A; 15–16 min, 20% A – 10% A; 16–20 min, 10% A – 90% A. The flow rate was 1 mL min–1 and UV absorption was monitored at 238 nm and 303 nm. LC-ESI-MS analysis of thiolactomycin was performed on a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), operating in positive ion mode. It was coupled to a HP1100 HPLC system (Agilent), fitted with a Phenomenex Prodigy C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm). Separation was achieved using a solvent system of acetonitrile and H2O (both containing 0.1% formic acid) with a linear gradient of 3–100% of acetonitrile over 42 min at a flow rate of 0.7 mL min–1. In vitro engineering of the core stu gene cluster The Type II Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) of Streptococcus pyogenes constitute a type of bacterial immune response, targeting cleavage of DNA perceived as foreign. RNA-guided Cas9 cleavage has been developed as the basis for highly precise and convenient genome engineering.59–61 In this work an in vitro CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing (ICE) procedure52 was used to specifically reduce the size of the DNA insert on 8G11 to the limits of the annotated stu cluster (stuE-stuF2). Cosmid 8G11 was first treated with Cas9, guided by gRNA-stuF2O-1 and gRNA-stuF2O-2 to generate a linear DNA fragment of interest lacking the right unwanted arm (∼10 kbp) of the insert. After end-repair using T4 DNA polymerase, the resulting linear DNA was then cyclised. The cyclised recombinant was again treated with Cas9, guided by gRNA-stuEO-1 and gRNA-stuEO-2, to create the linear DNA fragment now also lacking the left unwanted arm (∼5 kbp) of the insert. After end-repair, cyclisation generated pWHU2702, housing the annotated set of stu genes only. To study the role of the stuD1 and stuD2 cytochrome P450 genes in Tü 3010 biosynthesis, in-frame deletion recombinants for individual genes in the stu cluster were constructed using the ICE system described above. To construct pWHU2712 (ΔstuD1) for example, pWHU2702 was treated with Cas9, guided by gRNA-stuD1-1 and gRNA-stuD1-2, and the resulting linear fragment was end-repaired and self-ligated to create pWHU2712. The same procedure was used with guide oligonucleotides gRNA-stuD2-1 and gRNA-stuD2-2 to generate a plasmid-borne stu cluster housing ΔstuD2. The in-frame deletion recombinant plasmids were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing of the editing joins. The recombinant plasmids were then each introduced into S. avermitilis MA-4680 by conjugation, and the resulting recombinant strains were analysed for the heterologous production of Tü 3010. Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis Whole genome sequencing for S. olivaceus Tü 3010 and Lentzea sp. ATCC 31319 was carried out by the DNA Sequencing Facility in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, and whole genome sequencing for S. thiolactonus NRRL 15439 and Streptomyces sp. MG11 was commercially performed by Shanghai Southgene Technology Co., Ltd. (SSGT). DNA was analysed and annotated using Artemis Release 13.0.28 The bioinformatics program antiSMASH was used in initial identification and analysis of genetic clusters.3,62 Functional analysis of each gene product was carried out using BlastP30 and multiple protein alignments were compiled by Clustal Omega.63 Predictions for PKS and NRPS domains were made using the University of Maryland PKS/NRPS Analysis Website.64 The structures of molecules were drawn and chemical compound masses calculated using ChemBioDraw Ultra version 14.0 (Perkin-Elmer Informatics).

Gene Deletion and Complementation The oligonucleotide primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. DNA manipulation was conducted by following the methods described previously (Zhao et al., 2016). Briefly, for gene in-frame deletions, fragments containing the upstream and downstream regions of the target genes were cloned into pJQ200SK (Quandt and Hynes, 1993) and transformed into E. coli DH5α for the construction of gene in-frame deletion constructs. The final constructs were transformed into the competent cells of OH13 wild type or its derivatives by electroporation. The gentamycin-resistant colonies were screened by PCR using primers to identify the single crossover mutants. Then, the single crossover mutants were grown on NAWS medium containing 8% sucrose, which would screen for deletion mutants through a second homologous recombination of the flanking regions. The mutants were verified by PCR using primers. For complementation, the open reading frames (ORFs) of the target genes with their own promoters were cloned into pBBR1-MCS5 (Kovach et al., 1995). The expression constructs were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing and introduced into wild type or corresponding mutants by electroporation. The complementation strains were screened on NAWS medium containing gentamycin and were validated by PCR. Preparation and Analysis of Myxin L. antibioticus OH13 was cultivated for 24 h in a 250 mL flask containing 50 mL NB medium. The seed culture was then transferred into 200 mL 1/10 TSB medium in a 1 liter flask (a total of 50 flasks). The flasks were placed in incubators for 24 h with shaking at 180 rpm at 28°C. Then, the cultures were extracted with equal volumes of ethyl acetate, and the organic phase was evaporated to dryness under vacuum to yield the crude extract. The crude extract was chromatographed over a Sephadex LH-20 column using 1:1 CH2Cl2-MeOH as the elution solvent. The fractions were further purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with CH3CN in H2O (Agilent-C18, 5 μm, 9.4 × 250 mm) under 283 nm with a 4.0 mL/min flow rate. To analyze myxin production in OH13 and its derivatives, equal volume of ethyl acetate was used to extract 1 mL supernatant of cultures grown in 1/10 TSB. The crude extract was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and fully evaporated. Then, the residues were dissolved with 200 μL methanol and prepared for HPLC analysis. To determine the production of intracellular myxin, 1 mL culture grown for 20 h in 1/10 TSB was harvested and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. Supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with 1/10 TSB for twice. The pellets were extracted with 1 mL of ethyl acetate overnight. Then the extract was dissolved in methanol and subjected to HPLC. The detection of phenazines was through HPLC (Agilent SB-C18, 250 × 4.6 mm) with a 1.0 mL/min flow rate. The mobile phase was 20–45% CH3CN in H2O from 0 to 5 min, 45 to 50% CH3CN in H2O from 5 to 19 min, 50 to 60% CH3CN in H2O from 19 to 20 min, 60 to 100% CH3CN in H2O from 20 to 23 min, 100% CH3CN from 23 to 27 min, 100 to 20% CH3CN in H2O from 27 to 28 min, and 20% CH3CN in H2O from 28 to 30 min. Susceptibility Test of L. antibioticus to Phenazines The susceptibility of the OH13 wild type and mutants to phenazines was determined by agar screening tests. Myxin was dissolved in DMSO, whereas PMS was dissolved in water. Liquid precultures of each strain to be tested were grown in NB medium to 1.0 of OD600. Five microliters of cultures were spotted on NA media containing the indicated concentrations of phenazines and incubated at 28°C. After 24 and 48 h of growth, the colonies were imaged using a Canon camera. For the inhibition assays of myxin against Lysobacter strains, bacterial suspensions with OD600 1.0 were 100-fold diluted and then spread on NA plates, and subsequently different concentrations of myxin were dropped on filter papers. RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR Bacterial cells were cultured and harvested at an OD600 of approximately 1.0. RNA extraction was performed using the Omega bacterial RNA extraction kit (Omega biotek, Norcross, GA) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of RNA, A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios were determined by using an Eppendorf BioPhotometer plus. In qPCR analysis, a 250 ng RNA sample was used for genomic DNA elimination and cDNA synthesis by a Vazyme HiScript II Q RT SuperMix (with gDNA wiper) by following the manufacturer’s protocol. Specific primers for qRT-PCR (Supplementary Table S1) were designed by Primer 3 online. The housekeeping gene 16S rDNA was used as a reference. The qPCR analysis was conducted on a Quantstudio 6 Flex system (Applied Biosystems) using ChamQTM SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) with the following cycle profile: 1 cycle at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 34 s, and 1 cycle at 95°C for 30 s, 95°C 60 s, and 95°C for 15 s. The experiment was repeated three times, each time with triplicates. Data were analyzed using the 2–Δ\\nΔ\\nCT method. Construction of GFP Expressing Strains and Flow Cytometry Analysis Strains expressing GFP under the control of Plex were generated by homologous recombination. The fragment of gfp was integrated into the chromosome of L. antibioticus located in front of the lexA start site. We amplified regions ∼600 bp up and downstream of the gfp insertion locus using OH13 genomic DNA as a template, whereas gfp was amplified from a synthetic plasmid. The fragments were cloned into pJQ200SK using homologous recombination with a pEASY® -Uni Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (TransGen, China). The construct was transferred into the OH13 wild type and LaPhzB mutant strains through electroporation. After twice homologous recombination, the gfp fragment was integrated into the chromosome of L. antibioticus, subsequently obtaining the OH13 (Plex-GFP) and ΔLaPhzB (Plex-GFP) strains. For quantification of lex expression, strains were grown in 1/10 TSB medium for different time periods. The ΔLaPhzB (Plex-GFP) strain was also cultured in 1/10 TSB medium and supplied with different concentrations of myxin when the OD600 reached 0.6. GFP fluorescence was analyzed by detecting the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 10,000 cells with a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (BD FACSJazz). Construction of the Phylogenic Tree The amino acid sequence of LexB was applied to blast research in the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)1 and NCBI. 29 sequences from TCDB and 4 sequences of Lysobacter species from NCBI were downloaded. The amino acid sequences of the RND family proteins related to LexB were aligned, and a neighbor-joining tree was constructed with MEGA 7.0 (Kumar et al., 2016).']"

       "['LmrC antibiotic resistance protein is dispensable for resistance. To interpret the role of the three resistance proteins encoded in the lincomycin BGC, we first evaluated the contribution of the individual proteins to the resistance. Specifically, we knocked out lmrA, lmrB, and lmrC singly or in pairs in the lincomycin-producing S. lincolnensis wild-type (WT) strain (Fig.\\xa01b) and, in addition, we complemented the genes under the control of a constitutive or natural promoter acting in trans (see Fig.\\xa0S1). Furthermore, we constitutively expressed the genes in a lincosamide-sensitive Streptomyces coelicolor M1154 strain (26) (Fig.\\xa01c). Then, we evaluated the resistance phenotype of the WT, knockout, and complemented strains by determining the MICs of lincomycin and its derivative, clindamycin. We revealed that all strains bearing lmrA, including the strains with lmrA only (Fig.\\xa01b, S. lincolnensis strains WT, ΔC, ΔB, and ΔBC; Fig.\\xa01c, S. coelicolor strains ACC and AC), were highly or extremely resistant to lincomycin, while the resistance to lincomycin significantly decreased when lmrA was absent regardless of other two resistance genes were present. Interestingly, the resistance to clindamycin, generally a more efficient semisynthetic derivative of lincomycin, is different in this respect. Specifically, the majority of the tested strains were moderately resistant to clindamycin with no or little contribution of LmrA to the resistance (Fig.\\xa01b, compares the strains differing in lmrA only: ΔB versus ΔAB, WT versus ΔA, and ΔC versus ΔAC, and Fig.\\xa01c, AC versus M1154+pIJ10257). Therefore, we assume that LmrA, a transporter of the major facilitator family, is highly specific to lincomycin but not clindamycin, and it ensures sufficient self-resistance to the produced lincomycin on its own. In contrast to the LmrA transporter, the LmrB 23S rRNA monomethyltransferase confers high resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin when overexpressed in S. coelicolor (Fig.\\xa01c, BCC and BC). However, when naturally expressed in S. lincolnensis, it confers a significant level of resistance to clindamycin alone (Fig.\\xa01b, compares strains differing only in lmrB: WT versus ΔB, ΔC versus ΔBC, and ΔA versus ΔAB). The last resistance protein, LmrC, confers moderate resistance to both lincomycin and clindamycin when overexpressed in S. coelicolor (Fig.\\xa01c, strain CC). However, its contribution to the overall resistance in S. lincolnensis is not considerable relative to either LmrB (Fig.\\xa01b, compares strains ΔA versus ΔAC) or LmrA (Fig.\\xa01b, compares strains ΔB versus ΔBC). The ΔC knockout strain without lmrC showed a slightly increased lincosamide resistance compared to that of the WT (Fig.\\xa01b). It is worth noting that the complementation of the knockout strains under the control of the putative natural promoter restored the resistance phenotype of the WT except for lmrB (see Fig.\\xa0S1 in the supplemental material). In this case, complementation had to be performed under the control of a constitutive promoter because lmrB is cotranscribed with three upstream genes, as evidenced below. Interestingly, constitutive lmrB expression resulted in higher resistance values than those of lmrB expression in its original genomic context (see Fig.\\xa0S1). Furthermore, the resistance of S. lincolnensis WT and knockout strains was determined from spore suspension, which does necessarily reflect the resistance of the mycelium during lincomycin production. Therefore, we determined the MICs of S. lincolnensis deletion strains using spores and mycelia from two different time points of the seed or production cultures (see Fig.\\xa0S1). Overall, the data for mycelia comply with the data obtained for spores and show that resistance of the mycelium during production increased compared to the mycelium from the seed culture. Apart from investigating the resistance phenotypes, we determined the amount of lincomycin produced by S. lincolnensis WT and single-knockout strains in the culture broth (Fig.\\xa01b). The results support our conclusions drawn from the resistance of the strains. Specifically, the strains with high or extreme resistance to lincomycin were able to produce considerable levels of lincomycin, i.e., the strains bearing both lmrA and lmrB (which had the largest amount of lincomycin produced) and the strain bearing lmrA and not lmrB (which had up to 50% of the largest amount of lincomycin produced). On the other hand, strains without lmrA, which were the least resistant to lincomycin, produced only traces of lincomycin or nothing. The dispensability of LmrC for the overall resistance documented above complies with the comparable lincomycin production of ΔC versus WT strains. In addition, the production of lincomycin significantly fluctuated (Fig.\\xa01b). This observation could be explained by a more complex regulation-resistance system (LmbU, LmrA, LmrB, and LmrC) encoded within the lincomycin BGC compared to the highly similar BGC of another lincosamide, celesticetin (12), which contains only one nonbiosynthetic gene, the ccr1, coding for Ccr1 23S rRNA monomethyltransferase, as a self-protecting resistance protein homologous to LmrB (Fig.\\xa01a) (for a review, see reference 27). Indeed, the fluctuation of celesticetin produced by S. caelestis in parallel cultures is not as pronounced as that of the lincomycin produced by S. lincolnensis. Moreover, S. caelestis never failed to produce celesticetin (Fig.\\xa01d), while S. lincolnensis failed to produce lincomycin in several parallel WT cultures (Fig.\\xa01b). Expression of lmrA, lmrB, lmrC, and lmbU is induced by clindamycin. Given our hypothesis of the complex regulation-resistance system of lincomycin production, we wondered whether the expression of any of the lmbU, lmrA, lmrB, and lmrC genes could be affected by the produced antibiotic. Therefore, we cultured S. lincolnensis WT and divided the culture before the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis into two parallel cultures, one of which was supplemented with clindamycin at a subinhibitory concentration (Fig.\\xa02a). At several time points, we semiquantitatively monitored the expression of the respective genes by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Supplementation with clindamycin allowed us to distinguish between the lincosamide used to study its effect on the gene expression and the lincosamide produced by the strain, which we determined by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography.

The results in Fig.\\xa02a show that supplementation with clindamycin induced the expression of all the studied genes—lmbU, lmrB, lmrA, and lmrC—in the earlier stages of growth (9 to 16 h) compared to that of the untreated cultures (44 to 104 h), while no effect of clindamycin was observed on the rpoD control. In agreement with this observation, the onset of lincomycin production also shifted toward an earlier time of cultivation (44 h) in the cultures supplemented with clindamycin and reached higher values at the end of production culture (Fig.\\xa02b; see also Fig.\\xa0S2). The transcription of lmrA was induced more readily and was detectable over a longer period, while the relative amount of lmrC, lmbU, and lmrB transcripts decreased over time. Similar profiles of lmrC, lmbU, and lmrB transcripts indicate that these genes might be in the same operon. Amplification of lmbU from the 1st DNA strand synthesized using a primer specific to lmrB demonstrated that the expression of lmrB is directly coupled with that of lmbU and the two biosynthetic genes lmbX and lmbY (Fig.\\xa02c). On the other hand, an analogous mapping of the start of lmbU transcript (Fig.\\xa02d) and the end of lmrC transcript (see Fig.\\xa0S3a) showed that the lmrC gene is transcribed independently of the lmbUXY-lmrB operon. LmrC is essential for the antibiotic-induced onset of lincomycin production. Given the newly defined function of ABCF proteins as modulators of ribosomal PTC, the onset of lincomycin production in response to antibiotics might be regulated by LmrC. To uncover the role of LmrC, we performed comparative mass spectrometry proteomic analysis of the mycelia of S. lincolnensis WT, WT+Cc, and ΔC strains grown in the absence or presence of clindamycin. As shown in Fig.\\xa03a, clindamycin supplementation increased the abundance of lincomycin BGC proteins in both the WT (namely, proteins of the lmbUXYB operon) and WT+Cc (the whole BGC), while in the ΔC strain, lincomycin BGC proteins were more abundant in cultures without clindamycin. The induction by clindamycin was also observable at the lincomycin production level at 40 h in the WT+Cc strain but not in the ΔC knockout strain, where higher production levels were independent of clindamycin treatment (Fig.\\xa03a). No lincomycin was detected in clindamycin supplemented WT cultures, which contradicts the experiment in Fig.\\xa02a, where high levels of lincomycin were detected at the end of seed culture supplemented with clindamycin. Slight differences in cultivation conditions might be responsible for the shifted onset of lincomycin production between the two experiments (see Fig.\\xa0S7b). Nevertheless, these results suggest that LmrC is required for the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis triggered by clindamycin. To confirm that LmrC is essential for the transduction of antibiotic signal to the expression of lincomycin BGC, we quantified the transcripts of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN genes in S. lincolnensis WT and ΔC cultured with or without clindamycin at a time point before lincomycin BGC expression. As shown in Fig.\\xa03b, the clindamycin induced transcription of lmrC, lmbU, and lmbN, which was not under the direct control of lmbU, in the WT strain but not in the lmrC-deficient ΔC knockout strain. Notably, the observed low-level constitutive transcription of lmbU in the ΔC strain can be explained by the insertion of apramycin cassette (see Fig.\\xa0S3b), causing a polar effect. This phenomenon explains the increased production of proteins in ΔC (Fig.\\xa03a). However, it is important for our reasoning that neither protein production nor lmbU transcription in the ΔC strain is affected by clindamycin. ABCF family proteins generally exhibit ATPase activity, which is required for protein function (22). Therefore, we wondered whether LmrC is a functional protein capable of ATPase activity that induces gene expression. Hence, we complemented the ΔC knockout strain with lmrC or lmrCEQ12 expressed from a theophylline-inducible plasmid (Ci). The overproduction of functional LmrC resulted in the expression of lmbU and lmbN, while the overproduction of ATPase-deficient LmrCEQ12 mutant did not have this effect (Fig.\\xa03c). Notably, the expression of lmbU and lmbN mediated by the overproduction of LmrC was achieved without supplementation with clindamycin, and a similar phenomenon was observed at the protein level when LmrC was produced constitutively in the WT (the comparison of WT and WT+CC without clindamycin treatment is shown in Fig.\\xa03a). Altogether, these results demonstrate that clindamycin induces the production of LmrC, which in turn induces the production of LmbU, which is a known activator of lincomycin biosynthesis (24). FIG\\xa03Only ATPase-active LmrC is required for the induction of lmbU transcription by clindamycin.

Download Table\\xa0S1, PDF file, 1.1 MB. The antibiotic-LmrC-LmbU signaling cascade is independent of other S. lincolnensis regulatory elements. Several recent studies described regulators of lincomycin biosynthesis encoded outside the BGC in the S. lincolnensis genome (28–31). Some of these conserved global regulators might be involved in the antibiotic-induced onset of lincomycin production in addition to LmrC. To rule out this hypothesis, we cloned the lincomycin BGC region starting upstream of lmrC and ending with lmbU translationally fused with the mCherry reporter (C-U-mCh) and introduced it into S. coelicolor M145. Truncated versions of the construct without the 5′-half lmrC (U-mCh) and lmbU-mCherry expressed from the constitutive ermEp promoter (UC-mCh) were used as controls (Fig.\\xa03d). As expected, the induced production of the mCherry reporter in response to clindamycin was detected only in the strain with the full-length C-U-mCh construct, while in the strain with the truncated lmrC gene (U-mCh), the level of mCherry expression did not change after clindamycin induction. From these data, we concluded that lmbU expression, and thus the onset of lincomycin production in response to antibiotics, is mainly triggered by lmrC. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that S. coelicolor homologs of global regulators that contribute to lincomycin biosynthesis in S. lincolnensis, such as AdpA and BldD (32, 33), also affect the expression of lmrC and lmbU in S. coelicolor. LmrC production is induced by the LSAP group of antibiotics and dampened by LmrA and LmrB. We have shown that the LmrC-induced transcription of lmbU is largely dependent on how LmrC production is regulated in response to antibiotics. To gain more insight into the regulation of LmrC production, we first tested whether the inducing antibiotics were limited only to clindamycin. For this purpose, we treated S. lincolnensis WT cells with a range of ribosome-targeting antibiotics and a cell wall-targeting carbenicillin, and we detected LmrC protein levels using an LmrC-specific antibody. In addition to clindamycin, only lincomycin (lincosamide group), pristinamycin IIA (streptogramin A group), and tiamulin (pleuromutilin group), with lower efficiency, induced LmrC production (Fig.\\xa04a). Interestingly, the activity of these lincosamide-streptogramin A-pleuromutilin (LSAP) antibiotics with overlapping binding sites on the ribosome (Fig.\\xa04a) is compromised by antibiotic resistance ABCF proteins as exemplified by Vga(A)LC in staphylococci (18, 34, 35). This suggests that the regulation of LmrC production is coupled to its resistance function, which is the dislocation of the antibiotic from its specific overlapping binding sites within the PTC. Next, we investigated whether the lincomycin BGC-encoded resistance proteins LmrA and LmrB can affect the whole cascade by dampening lmrC expression. First, we evaluated LmrC protein levels in S. lincolnensis ΔB+B with constitutive overproduction of the LmrB methyltransferase. As shown in Fig.\\xa04b, LmrC production no longer responded to lincomycin and clindamycin, which do not bind to ribosomes methylated by LmrB, but instead remained responsive to the treatment with pristinamycin IIA (streptogramin A group), which can bind to methylated ribosomes (36). Since the lmrB gene is in the lmbUXY-lmrB operon encoding biosynthetic enzymes (Fig.\\xa02c and d), LmrB is an ideal candidate to provide a feedback loop of the cascade. Indeed, pronounced induction of lincomycin production was apparent in strain ΔB compared to the WT, whereas in the ΔB+B strain, constitutive lmrB expression dampened the onset of lincomycin biosynthesis (Fig.\\xa04c). FIG\\xa04LmrC production and lincomycin biosynthesis are induced by LSAP antibiotics and dampened by LmrA and LmrB. Western blot analysis of LmrC production in 16-h seed culture mycelium uninduced or induced by antibiotics. Protein production was detected using an LmrC-specific antibody (see Fig.\\xa0S5a and b).

(b) LmrC production is not induced by lincomycin and clindamycin in ΔB+BC with constitutive lmrB expression because lincosamides cannot bind to the ribosomes methylated by LmrB.

Download FIG\\xa0S5, TIF file, 1.3 MB. Next, we evaluated the effect of LmrA on LmrC protein levels. Since LmrA confers high-level resistance only to lincomycin (Fig.\\xa01b; see also Fig.\\xa0S1), there was a considerably higher level of LmrC in the WT induced by clindamycin than in the WT induced by lincomycin (Fig.\\xa04a and b), which may reflect the fact that only lincomycin is exported by the LmrA transporter; thus, the low intracellular levels are maintained (37). Indeed, deletion of lmrA (ΔA) resulted in comparable levels of LmrC expression induced by either lincomycin or clindamycin (Fig.\\xa04d). LmrA thus specifically dampens the LmrC production induced by lincomycin by reducing its intracellular concentration. Since both LmrB and LmrA reduce lmrC expression in response to antibiotics, we propose that alongside their resistance function, they also serve as a negative feedback loop to the antibiotic-LmrC-LmbU signaling cascade of lincomycin biosynthesis. LmrC production is regulated by ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation. Substantially reduced production of LmrC in the lmrB-overexpression strain (Fig.\\xa04b) after antibiotic induction showed that the binding of the antibiotic to the ribosome is a prerequisite for the induction of LmrC production. LmrC could thus be regulated by a ribosome-mediated attenuation mechanism as described previously for other antibiotic-resistant ABCF proteins (38–40): in the absence of antibiotics, either the formation of a premature terminator in the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) or the inaccessibility of ribosome binding site (RBS) prevent gene expression. In the presence of antibiotics, inhibited ribosomes stall during translation of the upstream regulatory open reading frame (uORF), which promotes the alteration of the 5′UTR secondary structure and thereby releases gene expression (41). Indeed, an in silico analysis of the lmrC upstream region revealed two putative promoters and two premature terminators with the ability to form alternative antiterminator conformations and several short uORFs (Fig.\\xa05a). To examine whether the attenuation mechanism is involved in the control of lmrC expression, we first used RT-PCR to map from which of the two predicted promoters lmrC is transcribed and the position of the premature terminator (Fig.\\xa05a). The analysis of RNA from the 16-h time point, where lmrC is induced by clindamycin, and from the 104-h time point, where lmrC transcription starts naturally without clindamycin supplementation (Fig.\\xa02a), showed that in both cases, the lmrC transcript starts from promoter P1 (Fig.\\xa05b). As shown in Fig.\\xa05c, the position of the premature terminator was mapped to the region between primers RT 4 and 5, which corresponds to the position of the predicted terminator 1 (Fig.\\xa05a). Next, we prepared a reporter system in which the lmrC upstream region, including its promoter, and full-length lmrC were translationally fused to mCherry (C-mCh). We introduced the construct into S. lincolnensis WT and S. coelicolor M145 strains and determined mCherry levels with or without clindamycin (see Fig.\\xa0S5d). The mCherry-specific signal was detected only in the presence of clindamycin in both strains, so further experiments were performed in S. coelicolor M145. A series of G-to-C and C-to-G point mutations (see Fig.\\xa0S6a) in the terminator hairpin led to the disruption and restoration of clindamycin-induced C-mCh production, confirming the terminator prediction (Fig.\\xa05d). To localize the uORF, we mutated the start codons of four upstream ORFs (ATG to ATC or ATG to AAG; Fig.\\xa0S6a). Surprisingly, only the disruption of uORF2, which partially overlaps with the terminator, led to strong constitutive expression of C-mCh, whereas mutations in other ORFs did not affect C-mCh production (Fig.\\xa05d). This observation suggests an unusual attenuation mechanism in which uORF2 translation is required to form a terminator structure. In summary, the antibiotic-mediated control of lmrC expression occurs via the formation of a premature terminator structure, which prevents lmrC expression in the absence of an antibiotic. LSAP antibiotics, if bound to PTC, trigger the shift from the terminator to the antiterminator conformation, enabling lmrC transcription (see Fig.\\xa0S6a). The lmrC transcript, specifically its attenuator, is thus the primary sensor of the antibiotic-LmrC-LmbU signaling cascade for lincomycin biosynthesis. FIG\\xa05LmrC production is regulated by a ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation mechanism. (a) An in silico analysis of the lmrC 5′UTR indicates the presence of two promoters predicted by NNPP (74) and G4PromFinder (75) with NNPP probability scores of 0.83 and 0.89 for P1 and P2, respectively, two transcriptional terminators predicted by PASIFIC (Prediction of Alternative Structures for Identification of Cis-regulation) (41) with PASIFIC scores of 0.71 and 0.44 for terminators 1 and 2, respectively, and four putative regulatory uORFs. The RT-PCR mapping strategy used to validate promoter and terminator predictions is shown. (b to d) The results of RT-PCR mapping (n\\u2009=\\u20093) show that lmrC is transcribed from the P1 promoter both after the addition of clindamycin (16 h, CLI) (b) and at the natural start of lmrC transcription (104 h, –no ATB) (c), lmrC transcript is prematurely terminated in the absence of clindamycin in the region between RT primers 4 and 5, thus validating the terminator 1 prediction. (d) Mutational analysis of the 5′UTR of lmrC validates the proposed ribosome-mediated attenuation mechanism.

LmrC is coproduced with seven other ABCFs, two of which are responsive to a lincosamide. The LmrC ABCF protein has a regulatory function, which transduces an antibiotic signal to activate lincomycin biosynthesis in S. lincolnensis. Comprehensive phylogenetic analysis classified 30 subfamilies of bacterial ABCF proteins (22). Four subfamilies (Uup, Etta, YdiF, and YbiT) have a broad distribution, while others, including subfamilies with the resistance function (ARE1-7), are taxon specific. Actinobacteria is a phylum with the highest number of ABCFs, including seven subfamilies specific to this taxon (AAF1-6, ARE4-5). In addition to LmrC, which belongs to the ARE5 subfamily, the genome of S. lincolnensis encodes eight ABCF proteins, three of which have putative resistance activity (ARE5 encoded by SLINC_7152 and two AAF4 encoded by SLINC_1109 and SLINC_6197). We speculated whether some of these resistance proteins are induced by clindamycin and thus could have an antibiotic-responsive regulatory function. We used the same mass spectrometry proteomics data set as used for the comparative analysis of lincomycin biosynthetic proteins to analyze the abundance of ABCF proteins in S. lincolnensis WT, WT+Cc, and ΔC strains grown in the absence or presence of clindamycin. As shown in Fig.\\xa03a, all but one ABCF protein was present in all samples, but only two (ARE5 and AAF4) out of three putative antibiotic-resistant ABCF proteins were substantially upregulated by clindamycin or produced lincomycin. The third putative resistance ABCF protein was not detected in any of the samples. Considering that the putative resistance function of these clindamycin-responsive ABCF proteins is redundant, they may have a regulatory function similar to LmrC.',\n",
       " 'Determination of the lexQSABC operon. The organization of the lexABC cluster and the gene lexR were described in our previous study (17). There are two other genes located closely upstream of lexABC; here, we have named them lexQ and lexS, respectively. The lexS gene overlaps lexA by 4\\u2009bp and is 8\\u2009bp immediately downstream of lexQ (Fig.\\xa01A). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed with complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesized using RNA from L. antibioticus OH13 to assess the coexpression of lexQ, lexS, lexA, lexB, and lexC genes. Fragments 1, 2, 3, and 4 from the two adjacent genes were amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) but not from RNA or the negative control (Fig.\\xa01B). Thus, the genes from lexQ to lexA formed an operon, designated lexQSABC. FIG\\xa01Determination of the lexQSABC operon. (A) Linear map of lexQ, lexS, lexA, lexB, and lexC genes with the genomic DNA of L. antibioticus OH13.

Deletion of lexR increased sensitivity to myxin, decreased myxin production, and significantly downregulated lexABC (17). Hence, we hypothesized that LexR directly regulates these genes. A putative promoter region found by the online promoter prediction tools BPROM may drive this coexpression (Fig.\\xa02A; see also the supplemental material). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to determine if LexR directly activates lexABC expression by binding to the promoter upstream of lexQ. A 165-bp DNA probe (lex probe) was amplified with primers labeled with biotin at the 5′ end. LexR with a His tag was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified using affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE showed a single protein band with a molecular mass of ~53.1\\u2009kDa, indicating that LexR was successfully expressed and purified for subsequent EMSA (Fig.\\xa02B). EMSA results indicated that purified LexR bound to the biotin-labeled lex probe, which reduced its mobility (Fig.\\xa02C). Moreover, DNA-protein-binding bands were enhanced with increasing concentrations of LexR. This phenomenon was greatly inhibited by unlabeled promoter (Fig.\\xa02C). We used a 158-bp promoter region (control probe) from another RND efflux pump operon to perform the control experiment. The result showed that LexR did not bind a probe of similar length from an unrelated promoter region (Fig. S1). Thus, the regulator LexR specifically binds to the promoter region of the lexQSABC operon. FIG\\xa02LexR directly regulates LexABC expression. (A) The predicted promoter region of the lexQSABC operon. The putative −35 and −10 sequences are shaded. The putative binding site is shown in red.

The online prediction revealed a putative LexR binding site in the lexQSABC promoter region (Fig.\\xa02A). Thus, we used 58-bp (probe 1) and 50-bp (probe 2) biotin-labeled probes with and without this site, respectively, to examine the need of this site for LexR binding. Subsequently, EMSA was carried out with purified LexR and probes 1 and 2, which showed that LexR bound to probe 1 but not to probe 2 (Fig.\\xa03). To further confirm that the predicted binding sequence for LexR is necessary or sufficient, we performed another experiment. Probe 3 (58\\u2009bp from the control probe in Fig. S1) and probe 4 (which replaced the predicted binding sequence to probe 3) were synthesized and then incubated with LexR in an EMSA (Fig. S2). The result showed that addition of the putative binding sequence to probe 3 could not sufficiently induce its binding to LexR (Fig. S2). Thus, the 8-bp putative binding sequence is necessary but not sufficient for LexR binding to the promoter region. FIG\\xa03Confirmation of the necessary sequence in the promoter region of lexQSABC for LexR binding. (A) EMSA results, indicating an 8-bp sequence necessary in the lexQSABC promoter for LexR binding.

The red bases are those necessary for LexR binding. Myxin enhances LexR binding to the lexABC promoter. We determined that myxin could efficiently increase the expression of lexABC genes in our previous study (17). So, we next examined whether lexABC transcriptional activation by myxin via enhancing LexR-DNA binding. An EMSA in the presence of myxin, LexR protein, and lex probe was performed. The result showed increased intensity in the LexR-DNA binding complex with myxin compared to LexR and probe alone but not affecting LexR-DNA migration in the gel. Increasing the myxin concentration resulted in more LexR-DNA complex formation, indicating that myxin enhanced LexR-DNA binding in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.\\xa04). Control assays were conducted with various concentrations of myxin added to the probes without LexR, which suggested that myxin did not damage the DNA probe under this condition (Fig.\\xa04). FIG\\xa04Myxin enhanced the binding of LexR to the lexQSABC promoter region. The reactions were performed with 5\\u2009fmol lex probe. The concentrations of LexR and myxin are shown.

The concentrations of LexR and myxin are shown. Myxin was incubated with DNA probe as a control. LexR displays a binding site for myxin. The three-dimensional structure of LexR predicted by AlphaFold was downloaded from UniProt. Domain prediction and molecular docking showed that the valine residue at position 146 (V146) and lysine at 195 (K195) were likely myxin binding sites (Fig.\\xa05A and B). This docking agrees with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Myxin was immobilized on the chip surface, and different LexR concentrations were run over the chip surface. LexR bound myxin with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.28\\u2009×\\u200910−9 M, indicating efficient binding (Fig.\\xa06A). Subsequently, we obtained residue mutants LexR-V146A, LexR-K195A, and LexR-V146A-K195A, to which myxin bound weakly, with KD values of 8.04\\u2009×\\u200910−6, 3.01\\u2009×\\u200910−3, and 8.1\\u2009×\\u200910−3 M, respectively (Fig.\\xa06B to D). Amino acid residues V146 and K195 are therefore essential for LexR binding by myxin, and K195 was more important for strong interaction. To further quantify the different effect of LexR and LexR-myxin complex on lexABC transcription, we constructed LexR site-directed mutants of V146A and K195A in vivo and detected the expression level of lexA in the mutants via quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Gene complementation of lexR partially restored lexA transcription compared to the lexR mutant, and V146A mutant acted identically to the complemented strain, whereas the K195A mutant showed a lower lexA expression level than the lexR complemented strain (Fig.\\xa07). The results indicated that the LexR-myxin complex contributes to lexABC transcription. FIG\\xa05Predicted binding sites of LexR to myxin. (A) Domain structure of LexR.

       " 'Comparison of the lasalocid BGCs from Streptomyces. In our previous study, we identified a 76,167-bp putative lasalocid gene cluster (lod [GenBank accession number KT591188]) from the genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (26). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the cluster contains 22 open reading frames (ORFs), designated lodA–lodT. In this study, to unravel the regulatory mechanism of lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species, we first compared lod with the other two lasalocid gene clusters (las and lsd from S. lasalocidi strains). The results showed that all three BGCs share highly conserved biosynthetic genes and two regulatory genes (lodR2 and lodR3) that encode MarR and LuxR family regulators, respectively (Table\\xa01 and Fig.\\xa01). Intriguingly, lod contains four exclusive ORFs: lodR1, encoding a TetR family regulator; lodA, encoding a protein with domains of unknown functions; lodB, encoding a monooxygenase; and lodC, encoding a 3-oxoacyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) synthase that is much longer than its putative homologs encoded by orf09 in las and lsd3 in lsd (Table\\xa01 and Fig.\\xa01). This result illustrates the diversity of lasalocid BGCs in Streptomyces, notably the diversity of their regulatory elements.

LodC (343 amino acids [aa]) is much longer than its putative homologs ORF09 (141 aa) and Lsd3 (144 aa). All three regulatory genes in lod function in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172. Three genes of the lod cluster are proposed to play a regulatory role in lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, including a variable gene (lodR1) and two conserved ones (lodR2 and lodR3). To verify the functions of these genes, we constructed their mutants by disruptive in-frame deletions in the Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 wild type (FXJ1.172-WT) and designated them ΔlodR1, ΔlodR2, and ΔlodR3, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the culture extracts from these mutants revealed a substantial loss of lasalocid production in the ΔlodR1 mutant and a complete loss in the ΔlodR3 mutant but a moderate increase in the ΔlodR2 mutant (Fig.\\xa02). Complementation with lodR1, lodR2, and lodR3 (inserted into pSET152 and driven by PkasO*) in the corresponding mutants partially or completely restored lasalocid production (Fig.\\xa02). These results indicate that lodR1 and lodR3 positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, while lodR2 plays a negative regulatory role.

AU, arbitrary units. LodR1 positively regulates lasalocid biosynthesis by repressing the expression of adjacent lodA–lodC, and this variable system of Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 seems to act similarly when introduced into S. lasalocidi. The variable gene lodR1 encodes a transcriptional regulator belonging to the TetR family, members of which are involved in various cellular activities, including but not limited to antibiotic production, quorum sensing, and the export of secondary metabolites (27, 28). To unveil the regulatory mechanism of LodR1, we performed transcriptional analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and DNase I footprinting experiments. Cotranscriptional analysis of lod by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed the existence of at least five transcriptional units (lodAB, lodED, lodR2–F, lodH–P, and lodST) and four individually transcribed genes (lodR1, lodC, lodG, and lodQ) (Fig.\\xa03A). It is noteworthy that lodR2 was cotranscribed with lodR3 and lodF in one operon. Next, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted to investigate the effect of lodR1 disruption on lasalocid biosynthesis at the transcriptional level. Total RNAs of FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodR1 mutant were isolated at days\\u20093 to 5. These time points were selected because lasalocid was initially detected in FXJ1.172-WT on the third day of fermentation, followed by a substantial increase in production over the next 2\\u2009days (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Compared to that in FXJ1.172-WT, the transcription of lodA–lodC was greatly enhanced in the ΔlodR1 mutant (Fig.\\xa03B), implying that LodR1 negatively regulates lodA–lodC. In contrast, the transcript levels of the structural genes (lodF, lodG, lodH–P, and lodST) were decreased in the ΔlodR1 mutant (Fig.\\xa03B). To determine the target genes of LodR1, EMSAs were performed with all potential interoperonic promoters indicated in Fig.\\xa03A and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 (a possible intraoperonic promoter may exist in this region of over 500\\u2009bp in length). Recombinant protein LodR1-His6 was purified from Escherichia coli C41(DE3) containing expression plasmid pET23b::lodR1. The result showed that LodR1 could specifically bind to the intergenic region of lodR1–lodA (PR1–A) rather than to the other promoter regions in lod or the promoter region of hrdB (Fig.\\xa04A and Fig. S2). LodR1 comprises an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain and shows high identity to SCO6121 from Streptomyces coelicolor and SVEN_3912 from Streptomyces venezuelae (both with 88% identity). To investigate the potential substrate of the ligand-binding domain in LodR1, EMSAs were performed with PR1–A in the presence of different antibiotics (including lasalocid as the most probable ligand and other antibiotics with structural diversity, such as ampicillin, apramycin, and chloromycetin). Yet no perturbation of the DNA-binding activity of LodR1 was observed (data not shown), indicating that these antibiotics are not ligands of LodR1. To further elucidate the exact DNA-binding sites of LodR1, DNase I footprinting was carried out with probe PR1–A. The results showed that LodR1 protected a region from nucleotide (nt) −52 to nt +38 relative to the lodA transcription start point (TSP) (Fig.\\xa04B). Analysis of this region identified a conserved recognition sequence (5′-CTAGCGTTGC-3′) forming a palindromic structure near the lodA TSP (Fig.\\xa04C). Together, these data suggest that LodR1 directly represses the expression of lodAB. As lodC was not cotranscribed with lodAB and its intergenic region with lodB could not be recognized by LodR1, the increase in the lodC transcript level in the ΔlodR1 mutant is likely due to the indirect repression of lodC by LodR1.

The coding regions of lodA and lodR1 are italicized. The inverted repeats are marked by arrows. (D) HPLC analysis of lasalocid A production in the Streptomyces lasalocidi ATCC 31180T wild type (31180-WT) and its derivatives 31180-KABC and 31180-R1ABC after fermentation for 240\\u2009h. 31180-KABC contains plasmid pSET152 with locus lodA–C driven by PkasO*, and 31180-R1ABC contains plasmid pSET152 with locus lodR1–C. Although the lodR1–lodC locus was found only in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, we speculate that it might also function in heterologous lasalocid producers. To test this speculation, the lodA–lodC and lodR1–lodC loci were heterologously expressed in S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T to generate strains 31180-KABC and 31180-R1ABC, respectively. As expected, the constitutive expression of lodA–lodC resulted in a dramatic decrease in lasalocid production in 31180-KABC (Fig.\\xa04D). In contrast, lasalocid production in 31180-R1ABC was comparable to that in the WT strain, which might be attributed to the inhibition of lodA–lodC expression by LodR1. These findings suggest that the variable genes lodR1 and lodA–lodC seem to function conservatively in lasalocid biosynthesis in different Streptomyces species. LodR2 and LodE constitute a conserved repressor-activator system that senses changes in the concentration of lasalocid and coordinates its biosynthesis. The regulatory protein encoded by lodR2 contains DNA-binding domains with a characteristic winged helix-turn-helix fold that is conserved in the MarR family of transcriptional regulators (29). As a common feature of MarR members, these regulators can interact with specific ligands to modulate the DNA-binding affinity, thus regulating the transcription of their cognate genes (30). LodR2 exhibits extremely high identity (93%) to its homologs Las3 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and Lsd6–7 (which should be an intact ORF but was likely interrupted and split into two truncated ORFs by misannotation) from S. lasalocidi ATCC 35851 (Table\\xa01), suggesting a conserved role of this MarR regulator in lasalocid biosynthesis. To functionally characterize the regulatory role of LodR2, experiments similar to those described above for LodR1 were carried out. RT-qPCR results showed that the transcript levels of lodR3 and all of the structural genes were significantly increased in the ΔlodR2 mutant compared to those in FXJ1.172-WT (Fig.\\xa03B). This finding indicates that LodR3 may activate the expression of structural genes. Meanwhile, the transcription of lodED was greatly enhanced in the ΔlodR2 mutant, indicating that LodR2 negatively regulates lodED. EMSAs of LodR2-His6 with all potential interoperonic promoters and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 also proved that LodR2 could specifically bind to the intergenic region of lodR2–lodE (Fig.\\xa05A and Fig. S2). Footprinting showed that LodR2 protected a region from nt −65 to nt +88 relative to the lodE TSP (Fig.\\xa05B). There is a conserved sequence, 5′-CATTCRT-3′ (where R is A or G), in the lodR2–lodE intergenic region, forming a palindromic structure near the TSP of lodR2 (Fig.\\xa05C). MarR family regulators, especially the cluster-situated ones, commonly have ligand-binding domains. To test whether the DNA-binding activity of LodR2 is modulated by lasalocid, EMSAs in the presence of different antibiotics were performed. The addition of lasalocid led to the dissociation of LodR2 from PR2–E, while the addition of the other antibiotics tested showed no effect on LodR2 (Fig.\\xa05D), indicating that lasalocid interacts specifically with LodR2 and abolishes its DNA-binding activity.

As the ΔlodR2 mutant exhibited enhanced lasalocid production and LodR2 directly repressed the transcription of lodED (Fig.\\xa02 and 3 and Fig.\\xa05A to C), it was suggested that the proteins encoded by lodED could activate lasalocid biosynthesis. Based on the proposed functions of lodE and lodD (Table\\xa01), we speculate that lodE (encoding a putative resistance protein) is vital for lasalocid biosynthesis. To test our assumption, a lodE mutant (ΔlodE) was constructed by disruptive in-frame deletion. Compared to FXJ1.172-WT, the ΔlodE mutant produced much less lasalocid (Fig.\\xa05E), which was consistent with the significantly decreased transcription of the structural genes lodF–lodS in this mutant (Fig.\\xa03B). Sequence alignment indicated that LodE belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of transporters with relatively high protein similarity to MonT (53% identity), a putative efflux protein responsible for self-resistance to monensin in Streptomyces cinnamonensis (31). To ascertain whether LodE acts as a transporter of lasalocid, we compared the intracellular and extracellular distributions of lasalocid in FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodE mutant. As expected, the ratio of intracellular/extracellular lasalocid concentrations of the ΔlodE mutant was significantly higher than that of FXJ1.172-WT (Fig.\\xa05F), confirming that LodE is a transporter of lasalocid. Moreover, FXJ1.172-WT and the ΔlodE mutant had comparable growth rates and biomasses (Fig. S3), excluding the possible effect of the growth perturbation of the mutant on lasalocid production. LodR3 positively regulates the expression of key structural genes in lod. The third regulatory gene, lodR3, encodes a prototypical LuxR family transcriptional regulator containing an N-terminal ATPase domain and a putative C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The ATPase-associated LuxR regulators are usually involved in antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces (32). LodR3 shows strong sequence identity (80%) to both Las4 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T and Lsd8 from S. lasalocidi ATCC 35851 (Table\\xa01). RT-qPCR analysis supported the above-mentioned result that LodR3 could positively regulate lasalocid biosynthesis. Very few transcripts of the structural genes were detected in the ΔlodR3 mutant compared to FXJ1.172-WT (Fig.\\xa03B), indicating that LodR3 is essential for initiating the transcription of the key structural genes. Unfortunately, all efforts to express soluble LodR3-His6 were unsuccessful. Thus, gusA transcriptional fusion assays were performed to determine the potential target genes of LodR3 as previously described (33). According to the results of the cotranscriptional analysis mentioned above (Fig.\\xa03A), the putative promoters of lodC, lodG, lodH, lodQ, lodS, and the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 were tested using Streptomyces coelicolor M1146 as a host (Fig.\\xa06A). As a result, blue color was detected in S. coelicolor M1146 derivatives containing lodR3 driven by PkasO* and gusA driven by the above-mentioned promoters except for the lodC promoter (Fig.\\xa06B). This result indicates that lodR3 may have its own promoter in the intergenic region of lodR2–lodR3 in addition to cotranscription with lodR2. It also suggests that the promoters of lodR3, lodG, lodH, lodQ, and lodS are the targets of LodR3 and that LodR3 can therefore directly activate the transcription of lodR3–F, lodG, lodH–P, lodQ, and lodST. FIG\\xa06Determination of the potential target genes of LodR3 by gusA transcriptional fusion assays. (A) Schematic diagram of gusA transcriptional fusions. Plasmid pSET152::PkasO*-lodR3 was used to overexpress lodR3, and the pIJ10500::Px-gusA plasmid contains a reporter gene, gusA, driven by the promoter (Px) of lodC, lodR3, lodG, lodH, lodQ, or lodS. Both pSET152::PkasO*-lodR3 and pIJ10500::Px-gusA plasmids were introduced into S. coelicolor M1146 to determine the target genes of LodR3.

(B) Chromogenic GUS assays of S. coelicolor M1146 derivatives.

Comparative and parallel functional analyses confirmed the conserved roles of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 homologs in controlling lasalocid biosynthesis in S. lasalocidi. S. lasalocidi strains are used as industrially valuable lasalocid producers, and thus, the regulatory mechanism of their lasalocid biosynthesis is worth dissecting for the construction of high-yield strains. As las and lsd are very similar clusters from the same species, we then selected las (which is from the publicly available S. lasalocidi type strain) to compare the functions of its regulatory genes with those in lod. Homologs of lodE, lodR2, and lodR3 were identified in las, which have been designated las2, las3, and las4, respectively (22). To verify the role of these genes in lasalocid biosynthesis, the corresponding disruption mutants (Δlas2, Δlas3, and Δlas4) were constructed from the S. lasalocidi ATCC 31180T wild type (31180-WT). Compared to that of 31180-WT, the lasalocid yield of the Δlas2 mutant was greatly reduced (from 33.8 to 4.7\\u2009mg/L), and that of the Δlas3 mutant was increased (from 33.8 to 112.5\\u2009mg/L), while lasalocid was no longer detected in the Δlas4 mutant (Fig.\\xa07A). Complementation with the genes in the disruption mutants restored the yields (Fig.\\xa07A). To verify the functional conservation of las4 and its homolog lodR3, cross-complementation of the two genes was conducted. As a result, both the ΔlodR3 mutant cross-complemented with las4 and the Δlas4 mutant cross-complemented with lodR3 could restore lasalocid production to the level of the WT strains (Fig.\\xa07B). Cotranscriptional analysis of las revealed the existence of at least four transcriptional units (las1–2, las3–5, lasAI–lasAVII, and lasCB) and two individual transcriptional genes (las6 and las7) (Fig. S4). Similar to their homologs in lod, las3–5 form a single operon. Likewise, RT-qPCR analysis of las genes in 31180-WT and the disruption mutants displayed transcriptional patterns similar to those observed for lod genes in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172 (Fig.\\xa07C). Moreover, soluble Las3-His6 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the expression plasmid pET28a::las3. Next, EMSAs and footprinting assays were performed to determine its target genes and binding sequences. As expected, Las3-His6 formed complexes with the intergenic region of las2–las3 and protected a region from nt −44 to nt +11 relative to the las2 TSP (Fig.\\xa07D). Analysis of the binding sites revealed an 8-bp palindromic sequence near the las2 TSP (consensus, 5′-CATTMRTT-3′ [where M is C or A and R is A or G]) (Fig.\\xa07D), which is similar to the 5′-CATTCRT-3′ (where R is A or G) sequence found in the lodR2–lodE intergenic region from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172. All of these results are consistent with those for Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.172, indicating a conserved regulatory mechanism of lasalocid biosynthesis in the two species. Based on the above-described regulatory studies, high-yield lasalocid-producing strains were constructed by overexpressing las4 in the Δlas3 mutant via a multicopy vector, pKC1139::PkasO*las4, or a single-site integrative vector, pSET152::PkasO*las4. The resultant mutants, Δlas3-1139-las4OE and Δlas3-152-las4OE, enhanced their lasalocid yields by 5.1 and 6.8 times, respectively, compared to 31180-WT (Fig.\\xa07A). Overall, by the simultaneous disruption of the negative regulatory gene las3 and the overexpression of the positive regulatory gene las4, we obtained high-yield strains with lasalocid production of up to 230\\u2009mg/L.

       " 'Self-resistance genes allocated within the cosmomycin D cluster. Analysis of the COSD biosynthetic gene cluster, located at contig 2 of the genome assembly of S. olindensis (JJOH00000002.1), enabled the assignment of each gene based on their homology to genes coding for proteins of known functions. The genes cosI (DF19_23560), cosJ (DF19_23565), cosP (DF19_23570), and cosU (DF19_23575) were identified as four candidate genes that might play a role concerning self-resistance. The products of cosI and cosJ are part of a superfamily of transport proteins (ABC transporters) that is one of the largest groups of proteins in nature (18). In detail, cosI codes for a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The amino acid sequence encoded by cosI shows the same features found in the prototypal anthracycline resistance protein DrrA from S. peucetius, such as the Walker A motif, Q loop, signature motif, Walker B motif, switch region, GATE (glycine loop and transducer element) domain, and DEF motif (19). This component is associated with transmembrane proteins that are responsible for the formation of pores through which substances are transported, known as transmembrane domains (TMDs) (20). The analysis of the product of cosJ shows a typical conformation of the TMD, composed of alpha helices organized as homodimers (21). Both proteins form part of the ABC transporter complex, which has 95.14% identity to the ABC transporter of Streptomyces purpurascens (accession numbers WP_189725841.1 and WP_189725842.1, respectively) (Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). For CosJ, six transmembrane helices, forming a transmembrane domain, can be predicted using Phyre and TMHMM (Fig. S1). In close proximity to cosI and cosJ, cosP could be identified as another plausible resistance determinant. It encodes an enzyme (accession number KDN80073.1) that shows 88.34% identity on the amino acid level with the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) from S. purpurascens (accession number GHA30648.1). Although proteins of this kind are commonly annotated as glutathione peroxidases, those in actinobacteria in fact represent mycothiol peroxidases, as enzymatically demonstrated in the protein with accession number ASW14906.1 from Corynebacterium glutamicum (17). Besides the gene encoding KDN80073.1, there is a second gene annotated with this function in the genome, with locus tag DF19_33265, which is found in contig 4 (JJOH00000004.1) and encodes the protein with accession number KDN79115.1. When we compared both proteins with the MPx of C. glutamicum (accession number ASW14906.1), KDN79115.1 showed a higher identity level (53.21%) than CosP (KDN80073.1) (43.4%), which resulted in higher values for the BLAST score and E value, which were, respectively, 175 and 2e−57 for KDN79115.1 and 139 and 3e−43 for KDN80073.1. When KDN80073.1 and KDN79115.1 were compared, they shared 55.1% identity. Searching selected Streptomyces reference genomes for annotated GPx or MPx genes, we found in general only one ortholog per genome, such as those that encode the proteins with accession numbers CAB88451.1 in S. coelicolor strain A3(2), WP_010985209.1 in S. avermitilis, WP_100106014.1 in S. peucetius subsp. caesius strain ATCC 27952, and EFL32854.1 in Streptomyces viridochromogenes strain DSM 40736 (Fig. S3). To understand how both annotated peroxidases of S. olindensis correlate with these proteins and with the remaining members of the GPx family in Pfam (accession number PF00255), similarity sequence networks (SSNs) were constructed. Since KDN80073.1 was not in the UniProt database, first a small SSN with 100 proteins, denominated “seed,” was generated with the Enzyme Similarity Tool (22) and the FASTA sequence of KDN80073.1 (Fig. S5), with the aim of identifying close relatives of KDN80073.1 within the GPx family in Pfam. Since an identity level of 60% or higher was assumed to be sufficient to identify isofunctional protein clusters (22), we chose a level of 70% identity as the threshold in the seed SSN, where cluster 2 contained KDN80073.1 and a further 12 members, listed in Table S2. A first SSN of Pfam family PF00255 was obtained using a threshold of about 55% similarity (Fig. S6); a large main cluster of 39,799 peroxidases included almost all actinobacterial proteins, together with those from other phyla, including known prokaryotic (e.g., BtuE of Escherichia coli [accession number P06610]) and eukaryotic (e.g., GPx1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [accession number P36014]) GPx proteins. When the threshold was increased to a similarity level of about 61% in a second PF00255 SSN, the actinobacterial proteins grouped in different clusters. Cluster 2 comprised 3,261 proteins and included the proteins with accession numbers CAB88451.1, WP_010985209.1, WP_100106014.1, and EFL32854.1; however, cluster 99 had almost the same composition as seed SSN cluster 2, excluding only KDN80073.1 (Fig. S7 and Table S2), which is not in the PF00255 database. Subsequently, a genome neighborhood network (GNN) was generated from that SSN (Fig. S8). The analysis of cluster 99 revealed that all members were in non-previously described cosmomycin clusters of different Streptomyces species. These findings could suggest that KDN80073.1 has an increased specificity for some peroxides generated by cosmomycin action. The third putative resistance mechanism is encoded by cosU, whose product shows 96.71% similarity to the excinuclease ABC subunit UvrA of Streptomyces janthinus (accession number WP_193483046) (Fig. S4), which is a member of a group of proteins associated with DNA repair (10, 23). The prototype of this group is DrrC from S. peucetius, which could bind to daunorubicin intercalated to DNA and displace anthracycline, thereby preventing nucleic acid damage and allowing the drug to be expelled by the DrrA/-B system (23). Self-resistance mechanisms are essential for S. olindensis when challenged with DOX and COSD. To understand the toxicity of COSD compared with that of pure DOX, COSD was isolated from S. olindensis using analytical fractionation. The fraction of interest showed a red-purple color. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) measurements revealed a candidate compound with protonated molecular masses of m/z 1,189.5901 ([M\\xa0+\\xa0H]+, calculated 1,189.590149, Δ\\xa0=\\xa0−0.04\\u2009ppm) and m/z 595.2991 ([M\\u2009+\\u20092H]2+, calculated 595.298713, Δ = +0.65\\u2009ppm), which were consistent with the molecular formula of COSD (C60H88N2O22) (Fig.\\xa01). A complementary tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of COSD, executed on its [M\\u2009+\\u20092H]2+ ion, produced fragment ions that were in full agreement with the expected structure (Fig. S9 and Table S1).

(B) HPLC profiles of COSD and DOX. The hypothetical self-resistance genes cosI, cosJ, cosP, and cosU were cloned into the expression plasmid pUWL_Apra_oriT, generating the recombinant constructs pRCWL04 (cosI cosJ), pRCWL05 (cosP), and pRCWL06 (cosU). Exconjugants of S. lividans strain TK24 carrying the corresponding constructs, as well as the empty vector, were used to determine the MICs (Table\\xa01) in a 96-well-plate assay format against COSD and doxorubicin (DOX) (Fig.\\xa02). As controls, S. olindensis and S. peucetius were used. FIG\\xa02MICs of COSD and DOX for selected Streptomyces species by 96-well-plate assay.

Final concentrations of DOX and COSD were 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128\\u2009μg/mL for both antibiotics (apramycin was added at 50\\u2009μg/mL when needed).

The endogenous resistance to COSD of S. lividans TK24 was 2\\u2009μg/mL; nevertheless, when it harbored the cosI and cosJ genes or the cosU gene, the resistance to COSD increased to the same level as that of S. olindensis (8\\u2009μg/mL). The recombinant containing the mycothiol peroxidase (cosP) did not reach this concentration, but it hit the concentration achieved by S. peucetius strain DSM 40754 (4\\u2009μg/mL). In a similar pattern, the cosI and cosJ genes or the cosU gene conferred higher resistance to DOX (16\\u2009μg/mL) than did cosP (8\\u2009μg/mL). S. olindensis had a resistance to DOX similar to that of S. peucetius; however, for COSD, S. olindensis was more resistant (8\\u2009μg/mL versus 4\\u2009μg/mL). On the other hand, S. lividans TK24 containing the empty pUWL vector did not show survival when exposed to COSD and DOX concentrations higher than 1\\u2009μg/mL. Self-resistance genes are mostly expressed during the production of COSD. We hypothesized that the S. olindensis wild-type (WT) strain overexpresses its self-resistance genes during production of the antibiotic. Thus, the expression levels of these genes were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) both during COSD production at 72\\xa0h and when COSD production was not detectable, at 24\\xa0h of cultivation (6). The endogenous gene hrdB (24) served as the reference (Fig. S10). For all genes, it was possible to confirm overexpression during the time when cosmomycin was produced compared with their expression levels during the cultivation stage when COSD was not yet detected (Fig.\\xa03). FIG\\xa03qPCR of cosI, cosJ, cosP, and cosU, with hrdB as the reference, during production (P) (72 h of cultivation) and nonproduction (N) (24\\xa0h of cultivation) of COSD by S. olindensis.

The mycothiol peroxidase (MPx) from S. olindensis consists of 163 amino acids, three of which are Cys residues (C38, C66, and C84). Additionally, we purified a C38S mutant enzyme of MPx (bearing a mutation of Cys to Ser at position 38), obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. S11). We evaluated the peroxidase activity of both enzymes by ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange (FOX) assay to quantify H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) reduction within a time frame of 180\\xa0s. The WT MPx consumed the majority of H2O2 within 15\\xa0s, whereas the C38S mutant enzyme remained catalytically inactive, demonstrated by a constant amount of H2O2 remaining in the assay over the time used. The FOX assay performed with tBOOH showed a significant decrease in the concentration of tBOOH, although the consumption rate was slower than in the case of H2O2, as only half of the tBOOH was reduced after 180s (Fig.\\xa04).

We also evaluated the MICs of H2O2 against S. olindensis, S. peucetius, and S. lividans (1 to 512\\u2009mM). For the concentrations tested, both of the anthracycline producers S. olindensis and S. peucetius survived 128\\u2009mM H2O2, thereby confirming a good response against H2O2. S. lividans was very sensitive to H2O2 (MIC of 8\\u2009mM) (Table\\xa02), but its resistance to H2O2 improved notably when it contained a vector expressing cosP, showing a MIC of 32\\u2009mM (Fig.\\xa05 and Table\\xa02). This result indicates that MPx relieves this stress on S. olindensis, allowing it to survive persistent oxidative conditions.

To understand the role of CosP in S. olindensis H2O2 consumption, we evaluated the capacity of COSD producer S. olindensis and nonproducer S. lividans to reduce H2O2 over time, under conditions that favor COSD production. For this, we measured the rates of H2O2 consumption of total protein extracts at 24, 48, and 72\\xa0h of growth (Fig.\\xa06). While both S. olindensis and S. lividans improved their H2O2 consumption rates at later growth stages, it was obvious that the cosP producer S. olindensis reduced H2O2 faster (Fig.\\xa06).

       " 'Genomic Structure of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels We used targeted sequence capture to characterize Nav sequences from the genomes of five salamander species (order Urodela), including three TTX-bearing newts (family Salamandridae, subfamily Pleurodelinae, tribe Molgini), Notophthalmus viridescens, Taricha torosa, and Taricha granulosa (n\\u2009=\\u20093 diploid individuals of each species), and two salamanders that do not possess TTX, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis (Crypotobranchidae) and Plethodon cinereus (Plethodontidae, n\\u2009=\\u20092 each). We also identified Nav sequences within two publicly available salamander genome sequences: Ambystoma mexicanum (Ambystomatidae; Smith et al. 2019; AmexG.v6 assembly) and Pleurodeles waltl (Salamandridae; Elewa et al. 2017) and a full-body transcriptome from the fire salamander Salamandra salamandra (Salamandridae; Goedbloed et al. 2017; BioProject accession number PRJNA607429), all three of which appear to lack TTX (Hanifin 2010). The split between Cryptobranchus (suborder Cryptobranchoidea) and all the other salamanders in our study (members of suborder Salamandroidea) represents the most ancient division in the phylogeny of extant salamanders (∼160 Ma; Hime et al. 2021). We identified six Nav genes in the genomes of all salamander species, which is consistent with observations in other amphibians (Zakon et al. 2011). Hereafter, we use the exon delineation introduced in Widmark et al. (2011), where domain I (DI) is encoded by exons 2-9, domain II (DII) is encoded by exons 13-16, domain III (DIII) is encoded by exons 18-23, and domain IV (DIV) is encoded by exons 25-26. We obtained near full-length assemblies for all paralogs (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online); however, a few exons containing TTX-binding sites, including exon 15 (encoding the DII P-loop) of Nav1.2 from N. viridescens and exon 22 (encoding part of the DIII P-loop) of Nav1.2 for several newt species, were missing from our assemblies. Polymorphism was rare in our assemblies and we observed few nonsynonymous mutations within the newt genomes, but we found slightly elevated polymorphism in N. viridescens relative to other species (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). No heterozygosity or nonsynonymous polymorphisms were observed in any of the known TTX-binding P-loop regions within any of the species sequenced for this study. Synteny of Nav genes in A. mexicanum is conserved relative to other tetrapods (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), which allowed us to use the A. mexicanum sequences as a baseline to confidently identify Nav paralogs in all species. Three of the paralogs, Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 are arrayed in tandem on A. mexicanum chromosome 9, with Nav1.2 inverted relative to its neighboring paralogs (table 2 and supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). The additional three paralogs, Nav1.4, Nav1.5, and Nav1.6, are each located on separate chromosomes (table 2). In the gene family tree built from amino acid sequences, all salamander Nav proteins formed a monophyletic clade (bootstrap support >98%) with the corresponding orthologs from the genomes of the frogs Xenopus tropicalis and Nanorana parkeri, which we included as outgroups (fig. 1). The gene family tree constructed from the nucleotide-coding sequences of these genes yielded a similar topology, with each salamander Nav ortholog forming a monophyletic clade. However, in the nucleotide gene family tree, the three X. tropicalis nerve channels Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 formed a monophyletic clade that is distinct from the salamander sequences (bootstrap support 86%; supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). The same tree topology was resolved when partitioning for the third codon position (see Supplementary Material online on Dryad).

Partial Duplication of Nav1.4 and Evolution of TTX Resistance in Duplicated Domains Our search of the A. mexicanum genome revealed a partial tandem duplication of the 3′ end of the Nav1.4 gene, including the full coding region of exon 26, located ∼180,000 base pairs downstream of the full-length Nav1.4 gene on the same DNA strand (table 2). Both exon 26 copies are similar in length to each other and to exon 26 of other paralogs, encoding open reading frames of approximately 390 amino acids without introduced stop codons. Exon 26 is the 3′-terminal exon of the Nav1.4 gene and encodes the TTX-binding P-loop region of DIV. Hereafter, we refer to the duplicate exons as 26a (more proximal to exon 25) and 26b (more distal to exon 25) and duplicate P-loop regions as DIVa (more proximal to exon 25) and DIVb (more distal to exon 25). We also found this duplicated exon in Nav1.4 orthologs within the genomes of salamanders P. cinereus, Ple. waltl, N. viridescens, T. torosa, and T. granulosa and in published transcriptomes of Tylototriton wenxianensis and Bolitoglossa vallecula, but not in the transcriptome of Hynobius retardatus or in the genomes of C. alleganiensis or the frogs X. tropicalis or Nan. parkeri. This pattern suggests that the duplication event likely took place after the split of Cryptobranchoidea and Salamandroidea (fig. 2). Within the S. salamandra transcriptome, we found four unique RNA sequences transcribed from the Nav1.4 locus, with alternative splicing of exon 17 and alternative encoding of either exon 26a or 26b. Genome-mapped reads of multitissue transcriptomes of A. mexicanum (Bryant et al. 2017; Caballero-Pérez et al. 2018; Nowoshilow et al. 2018) indicate that these alternative transcripts have similar expression profiles across various tissues. Taken together, these observations provide evidence that the duplication of exon 26 led to the creation of functional splice variants in these salamanders.

Black circles indicate node bootstrap support >95%. “R” at tips indicates the presence of substitutions conferring extreme (orange) and moderate (blue) TTX resistance. The same tree topology was resolved using an alignment of amino acids translations of these sequences. Although numerous nonsynonymous substitutions differentiated the duplicated Nav1.4 exon 26 sequences relative to the original sequences within each genome, we found that identical substitutions conferring extreme TTX-resistance to toxic newts (Hanifin and Gilly 2015) were present in both exons from the genomes of all three TTX-bearing newts but not in other, less toxic salamander species (fig. 2). Also consistent with the results of Hanifin and Gilly (2015), we found resistant substitutions conferring moderate TTX resistance in exon 26a of Ple. waltl, Tyl. wenxianensis, and S. salamandra; however, we observed no resistant substitutions in exon 26b outside of the toxic newt clade. Evolution of TTX Resistance in Salamanders We characterized levels of TTX resistance in each Nav paralog as extreme, moderate, and TTX-sensitive based on previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments in which substitutions were introduced to TTX-sensitive Nav channels and cross-membrane Na+ current was measured in vitro in the presence and absence of TTX (table 3). Our results confirm that T. granulosa has six paralogs with extreme TTX resistance (table 3 and fig. 3). Our findings are consistent with those reported by Vaelli et al. (2020) with one exception: we associate DIV (encoded by exon 26) substitutions A1529G, G1533V, and G1533A with Nav1.1 and Q1524E, G1533R, and G1533Q with Nav1.2 based on synteny mapping (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), gene trees (fig. 1 and supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online), and a phylogeny created from a coding sequence alignment of exon 26 (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online), whereas the previous study reversed these assignments. We also show that substitutions with extreme TTX resistance are present in all six Nav paralogs in two other species of highly toxic newt, T. torosa and N. viridescens, indicating that the common ancestor of these three species possessed extreme TTX resistance. Many of the substitutions in toxic newts parallel those found in TTX-bearing fish and in snakes that consume tetrodotoxic amphibians (table 3).

Parallel substitutions in Nav channels of TTX-bearing pufferfish and in snakes that consume TTX-bearing prey. Resistance category determined from action potentials recorded from salamander muscle fibers. No salamander species outside the clade of highly toxic newts possessed a full complement of TTX-resistant Nav paralogs, indicating that the evolution of full physiological resistance coincided with the origin of extreme toxicity. However, we found at least three paralogs with moderate or extreme TTX resistance in all salamander species we examined, indicating that the evolution of TTX resistance in newts built upon more ancient changes that first appeared in their nonnewt relatives. Substitutions conferring moderate or extreme resistance were observed within the heart channel Nav1.5 and brain/nerve channels Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 of all salamander species, with additional resistance-conferring substitutions evolving within TTX-bearing newts. As first shown by Hanifin and Gilly (2015), moderate resistance was present in the skeletal muscle channel Nav1.4 of S. salamandra and Ple. waltl, but not in the three other salamander species we examined. Although our outgroup, the frog X. tropicalis, also contained a highly resistant substitution in Nav1.2, we found no evidence for resistance in this paralog in any salamanders outside of tetrodotoxic newts. Based on our ancestral sequence reconstructions, the most recent common ancestor of all salamanders had three TTX-resistant sodium channels: Nav1.1 (brain, moderately resistant), Nav1.5 (heart, highly resistant), and Nav1.6 (brain/peripheral nerves, moderately resistant; fig. 3 and supplementary figs. S4–S9, Supplementary Material online). Moderate resistance in the muscle channel Nav1.4 appeared between 75 and 130 Ma, after the divergence of Ambystomatidae and Salamandridae (the family consisting of true salamanders and newts; Hanifin and Gilly 2015). This gain in muscle resistance coincided with the appearance of two highly resistant substitutions in DI of Nav1.5, which are present in all Salamandridae. Extreme TTX resistance across all Nav paralogs evolved more recently, occurring approximately 30 Ma, after the split between primitive newts, which include Pleurodeles, and modern newts (Hime et al. 2021), which include all TTX-bearing species. Over this time period, TTX resistance evolved in Nav1.2 and Nav1.3, and multiple additional resistant mutations appeared and became fixed in Nav1.1, Nav1.4, and Nav1.6. Selective Regimes and Evolutionary Rates In order to characterize the selective regimes acting on Nav genes, we used the codeml program in PAML (Yang 2007) to fit models of selection to Nav codon alignments and compared nested models using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs). We tested for site-specific positive selection within all amphibians by comparing two sets of nested models: one set using a discrete distribution of ω values either with or without positive selection (M1a vs. M2a; Yang et al. 2005); and another set fitting a continuous distribution of ω values under purifying selection only, or adding categories of unconstrained evolution and positive selection (M7 vs. M8 and M8a vs. M8; Yang et al. 2000). Parameter estimates and LRT results for site models are summarized in supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online. To test for selection within toxic newts, we fit branch (Yang 1998) and branch-site models (Zhang et al. 2005) to our data sets, which allowed ω to vary both among codon sites and between toxic newts and other amphibians (summarized in supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). All models estimated relatively low ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution (dN/dS, or ω ratios) for all Nav paralogs (average ω ratios from branch models ranged from 0.05 to 0.23), indicating pervasive purifying selection. Based on LRTs comparing one ω-value models (which allow only for one ω value across the entire phylogeny) to branch models (allowing for a different ω ratio in the toxic newt clade relative to other amphibians), we found that ω ratios were significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) higher in toxic newts for Nav1.1, Nav1.3, and Nav1.4 and nonsignificant (P\\u2009>\\u20090.01) for Nav1.2, Nav1.5, and Nav1.6 (fig. 4A and supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). The largest difference in ω ratios in the branch test was observed for the muscle channel Nav1.4 (newt ω\\u2009=\\u20090.23; all salamanders ω\\u2009=\\u20090.10), which appears to be due to both an increase in the proportion of unconstrained sites as well as a larger number of estimated sites undergoing positive selection (fig. 4B). However, the posterior probability support for positive selection at many of these sites was low, and LRTs from branch-site models indicated significant evidence for a shift in positive selection only in paralog Nav1.3 (supplementary tables S4 and S5, Supplementary Material online).

Significant differences based on likelihood ratio tests are indicated with * (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and ** (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Although likelihood-ratio tests were nonsignificant for NaV1.1 and NaV1.4 (supplementary tables S3 and S4, Supplementary Material online), PAML identified a large proportion of amino acid coding sites within these paralogs with elevated dN/dS ratios in toxic newts. Our site and branch-site models identified a number of TTX-binding sites with elevated ω ratios (table 4 and supplementary tables S5 and S6, Supplementary Material online). Because of the small number of species in our study, we had low power to detect statistically significant positive selection (Yang et al. 2000; Anisimova et al. 2001; Kosakovsky Pond and Frost 2005), and the posterior probabilities provided low-to-moderate support for positive selection at most sites. We also note that the false positive rates of site selection models can be inflated due to gene conversion events (Casola and Hahn 2009), among-site variation in dS (Kosakovsky Pond and Frost 2005), and multinucleotide mutations (Venkat et al. 2018). However, results were consistent between the M2a and M8 models, and the codons that were identified suggest that positive selection may have been important for observed substitutions in TTX-binding regions.

Nonconservative amino acid substitutions associated with TTX resistance in toxic newts. Sites identified with branch-site models using empirical Bayes method (posterior probability >0.50). Empirical Bayes posterior probability >0.95. Within the brain channels Nav1.1, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6, putative positive selection was detected by site models at site 401 within the DI P-loop, indicating selection acting across all salamanders rather than specifically within toxic newts (table 4). Replacement of the aromatic amino acid at site 401 with a nonaromatic amino acid can substantially impact TTX-binding capacity (Leffler et al. 2005; Venkatesh et al. 2005; Vaelli et al. 2020), and we observed nonaromatic substitutions at this site within all brain channels of highly toxic newts (fig. 3 and table 3). The codon sequence for site 401 was variable across many salamanders lacking TTX; however, almost all of the nonsynonymous changes observed outside of TTX-bearing newts were biochemically conservative (both phenylalanine and tyrosine are aromatic and do not affect TTX binding; Sunami et al. 2000), with the exception of the 401A observed in P. cinereus Nav1.1. This conservative variation likely contributes to the signal of diversifying selection acting on this codon in less toxic salamander lineages. Site models also suggested positive selection acting on site 1533 in DIV of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 (table 4). Although the substitutions present at site 1533 in these newt paralogs have not been tested experimentally for their effects on TTX binding, Maruta et al. (2008) showed that a G1533T substitution at this site led to a moderate (∼2- to 3-fold) decrease in TTX-binding affinity, and substitutions at this site are common in TTX-resistant channels (Geffeney et al. 2005; Jost et al. 2008; Feldman et al. 2012; McGlothlin et al. 2016), suggesting that these nonsynonymous changes likely also reduce TTX-binding affinity in newts. Within the toxic newt lineage, we identified putative positive selection acting on three known TTX-binding sites: 1240 and 1532 in DIII and DIV of muscle channel Nav1.4 and 1529 in DIV of brain channel Nav1.1 (table 4). In Nav1.4, sites 1240 and 1532 contain resistance-conferring substitutions exclusively within toxic newts and these substitutions have been associated with extreme TTX resistance in Taricha muscle fibers (Hanifin and Gilly 2015). In Nav1.1, site 1529 encodes part of the Na+ selectivity filter (comprised interacting amino acids DEKA—sites 400, 755, 1237, and 1529), which is highly conserved across Nav paralogs. An A1529G substitution (resulting in a DEKG filter) is present in Nav1.1 of A. mexicanum and all members of the toxic newt clade. Although this substitution does not appear to affect Na+ selectivity or to be sufficient in preventing TTX from binding (Jost et al. 2008), it may alter channel firing properties, as this A1529G substitution resulted in substantially higher Na+ currents relative to the wild-type when introduced into a mammalian Nav1.4 channel (Jost et al. 2008). The same alanine to glycine substitution has been observed in Nav channels of TTX-bearing flatworms (Jeziorski et al. 1997) and pufferfish (Jost et al. 2008), which suggests that it may play a role in TTX resistance in these organisms. Outside of TTX-binding regions, we found evidence for putative positive selection in similar regions across multiple Nav paralogs (supplementary tables S5 and S6, Supplementary Material online). For Nav1.4, the majority of sites under positive selection reside in terminal exon 26a that encodes the DIVa P-loop (exon 26b was excluded from this analysis due to its absence in some species). For most other paralogs, the largest clusters of sites with elevated dN/dS ratios were within the DI L5 turret (the extracellular loop upstream of the DI P-loop, encoded by exons 6 and 7) and the DIII L5 turret upstream of the DIII P-loop encoded by exon 21. These sites may facilitate interaction with other proteins, or alternatively, some of these sites identified by the branch-site model may be selected to compensate for biochemical changes produced by TTX-resistant mutations. Gene Conversion Events We also tested for evidence of nonallelic gene conversion as a mechanism of sequence evolution contributing to adaptive evolution in Nav genes using the program GENECONV. Nonallelic or ectopic gene conversion results from an interlocus exchange of DNA that can occur between closely related sequences during double-stranded break repair (Hansen et al. 2000). GENECONV uses the information in a multiple sequence alignment to identify regions of similarity shared between two sequences that is higher than expected by chance based on comparisons to permuted alignments (Sawyer 1989). We selected this program to detect gene conversion because of its low false positive rates and robustness to shifts in selective pressure (Posada and Crandall 2001; Bay and Bielawski 2011). Because nonallelic gene conversion is more likely to occur between paralogs residing on the same chromosome (Semple and Wolfe 1999; Drouin 2002; Benovoy and Drouin 2009), we limited our search to events between the tandem duplicates Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 and between exons 26a and 26b of Nav1.4 within each salamander genome. Although few gene conversion events were detected within each species by GENECONV, all of the regions that were detected within Taricha newts contain TTX-binding sites with substitutions associated with TTX resistance, including the DIVa and DIVb P-loops of Nav1.4 (fig. 5 and table 5). We observed three TTX-resistant amino acids (I1525S, D1532S, G1533D) within the DIVa and DIVb P-loops of Nav1.4 in toxic newt genomes. In contrast, Ple. waltl, a closely related but nontetrodotoxic newt, contains one moderately TTX-resistant amino acid (I1525S) in the DIVa P-loop and no resistant amino acids in the DIVb P-loop (fig. 5A). These differences involve four identical nucleotide changes at homologous sites in both exon duplicates. Our short reads from the genomes of N. viridescens and Taricha newts mapped onto each of these exon assemblies across putative recombination break points with high (>50-fold) coverage, lending support for sequence convergence rather than an assembly error. We did not detect gene conversion between these exons within the genomes of T. granulosa or N. viridescens; however, this may be due to the low power of GENECONV to detect conversion (Bay and Bielawski 2011), particularly in the presence of low sequence diversity and when the conversion tract is shorter than ∼100\\u2009bp (Posada and Crandall 2001; McGrath et al. 2009). Together, these results suggest that the three resistant amino acids accumulated together in one exon copy followed by conversion of the other exon ∼30 Ma in a toxic newt ancestor. Fig. 5.Gene conversion within TTX-binding regions. (A) Gene conversion was detected between DIVa and DIVb P-loops within duplicate exons 26a and 26b of Nav1.4 in Taricha torosa. Substitutions conferring TTX resistance are highlighted in yellow and blue. Although one moderately resistant substitution is present in DIVa of less toxic salamanders (1,525 T/S), three identical substitutions are present in both DIVa and DIVb of highly toxic newts.

Putative gene conversion events associated with the gain of TTX resistance. We also detected gene conversion between the DI P-loops of paralogs Nav1.1 and Nav1.3 within the genomes of both Taricha species (fig. 5B and table 5). TTX-resistant substitutions are identical in the DI P-loops of Nav1.1 and Nav1.3 in both Taricha species (401A, encoded by a GCT codon), whereas Nav1.1 of N. viridescens contains a different codon at this position (TGC, encoding 401C), consistent with gene conversion occurring at this locus in Taricha. Both Nav1.1 and Nav1.3 of nontetrodotoxic Ple. waltl newts encode a TTX-sensitive tyrosine at this locus. It is unclear whether putative gene conversion event(s) occurred before or after resistance evolved in both paralogs. Gene conversion may have converted a nonresistant channel to a resistant channel in an ancestral Taricha, whereas N. viridescens independently acquired a Y401A substitution, or it may have homogenized substitutions within two channels that had previously evolved resistance in an ancestor of all toxic newts. In Taricha newts, the transition from either tyrosine or cysteine to alanine required multiple nucleotide substitutions in both paralogs, making gene conversion a likely explanation for the observed substitution patterns. We detected additional gene conversion events that may have involved a nonresistant paralog acting as a donor to a resistant paralog, leading to the loss of TTX resistance in A. mexicanum and C. alleganiensis paralogs. A resistant substitution is present in the DIII P-loop of Nav1.1 in most salamanders but is absent in Nav1.1 of A. mexicanum (fig. 3), and we detected gene conversion in an adjacent region between Nav1.1 and the nonresistant Nav1.2 paralog within the A. mexicanum genome (table 5 and supplementary fig. S10A, Supplementary Material online). Similarly, C. alleganiensis Nav1.2 contains a nonresistant 1533G within DIV of all six paralogs, whereas Nav1.2 of X. tropicalis frogs encodes a putatively TTX-resistant 1533L, and gene conversion between paralogs Nav1.2 and Nav1.3 may have facilitated the loss of this substitution in salamanders (supplementary fig. S10B, Supplementary Material online).',\n",
       " '2.1. The Resistance-Gene Database Table 1 shows the number of resistance genes collected from four major data repositories. Among these four databases, the resistance genes collected from CARD have detailed annotation information. Therefore, they are directly used in our database without the need for further modification or additional annotation. MIBiG records valuable BGC data, including well-characterized product information [26]. The mechanisms of most resistance genes were determined manually from annotations in the database and subsequently validated by comparison with the CARD database. A total of 629 hidden Markov model profiles of resistance genes were collected from NCBIAMR, and each of them was manually annotated with their involved resistance mechanism and compound. The functional annotation of the resistance genes found in the Uniprot database is less than that given by the other three databases. Except in the case of the efflux pump, most of the annotation is completed by comparing these genes with resistance genes recorded in the other three libraries by transferring the annotation obtained on the linkage to the query Uniprot genes. Table 1 also provides statistics on the annotated resistance mechanisms in the database, showing that product inactivation is the most frequent among the five resistance mechanisms, followed by the efflux pump, while the target modification mechanism is the least frequent. Supplementary Table S1 lists all 7297 entries of resistance gene sequences and 629 HMM models of resistance gene profiles in the database. As a demonstration of the application of the RGDB database, it is interesting to study the distribution of resistance genes inside the recently disclosed marine bacterial genomes and, in particular, to analyze their relationship with the natural products that may be synthesized by the gene clusters of these bacteria. 2.2. The BGCs in the Bacterial Genomes of MarRef The marine microbial genome is considered one of the richest resources for natural products due to the diverse environmental conditions in which marine microorganisms live; the genome has proven extremely valuable in discovering new natural products with different structures and biological activities. An important reason for the diversity of marine natural products may be that microbial populations compete to win by synthesizing complex, biologically active, and diverse compounds to inhibit the growth of other similar populations in survival competition. We applied the RGDB to analyze a recently published marine microbial genome dataset, i.e., the MarRef dataset. A total of 1403 genomic sequences were downloaded from GenBank [42] for the MarRef dataset, 13 of which could not be processed with antiSMASH 6.0 due to formatting errors, resulting in a total of 1390 genomes being analyzed in this study. The detailed species taxonomy of the selected organism is listed in Supplementary Table S2, which is summarized in Figure 1A. Parsing these genomes with antiSMASH yielded 7432 BGCs, ranging from 5 to 670 kb. Figure 1B shows the distribution of the broad classes of BGC products detected, with the most abundant being RiPPs (22%), followed by terpenoids (14%) and NRPS (12%). Note that antiSMASH could not even determine, for the remaining 40% of the BGC products, which class of compounds they belonged to, let alone their specific compound structures and activities. Statistical analysis by species origin of BGCs showed that the three major bacterial producers of secondary metabolites are Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, which together contributed more than 80% of the BGCs, and the archaeal producer Euryarchaeota, which contributed 2% of the BGCs (Figure S1). BGCs from other clades contribute much less and are therefore not shown. As previously observed, the number of BGCs per genome varies considerably among bacteria. 2.3. Preliminary Product Annotation of BGCs by Organizing Gene Clusters into Gene Cluster Families Identifying BGCs with known metabolites is essential to genome mining, allowing researchers to prioritize known and unknown biosynthetic pathways for new natural product discovery [43]. Gene cluster family (GCF) analysis enables the large-scale annotation of query BGCs based on their similarity to the reference BGCs in MIBiG with well-characterized product and derivative information. After GCF analysis, these marine BGCs were first grouped into families using BiG-SCAPE, yielding the gene cluster families (GCFs). BiG-SCAPE [39] analysis showed that the studied BGCs were mainly clustered together within orders, resulting in a set of 5803 GCFs (of which, only 518 families had more than three members) organized into a network based on their genetic components and arraignment within the reference BGCs (Figure 2). The analysis resulted in 5803 GCFs, of which, only 208 GCFs, i.e., 3.6% of the total, had a corresponding 327 reference BGCs in their family. The product information of these GCFs was then predicted based on that of the reference BGCs, resulting in 23 RiPPs, 10 terpenes, 94 NRPS, 102 PKS, 31 PKS-NRPS, and 67 other products. Note that hybrid BGCs, such as those of PKS-NRPS, might be presented in more than one family; a similar scenario was found in previous GCF analyses [38]. 2.4. Identifying Resistance Genes in MarRef BGCs Using RGDB The identification of resistance genes in MarRef BGCs is straightforward using the newly constructed RGDB, which gives 7079 putative resistance genes distributed in 3878 BGCs (see Table S3 for details; also see http://www.mingbioinfo.online/rga/marrefdata (accessed on 23 February 2023)). These identified resistance genes were classified according to their resistance mechanisms, the most common being efflux pumps, with a total of 4183. Most efflux pumps are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters. Some efflux pumps have narrow substrate specificity, such as tetracycline efflux, while others are relatively broad. As the most typical mechanisms of product inactivation, aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, and glyoxylate/bleomycin resistance proteins repeatedly appear in these MarRef BGCs. Vancomycin resistance genes were found to be the most frequently occurring genes for target-related mechanisms. It is worth mentioning that the 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase used for fatty acid biosynthesis is present in many BGCs. Previous studies have found that copy number can be increased by self-replication and mutation, thus providing resistance to the host [44,45]. The analysis of these putative resistance genes showed that 118 of these 3878 BGCs detected to have resistance genes did carry multiple resistance genes of different types and mechanisms, without considering the efflux pump mechanism (see the two cases in Table 2). Thus, resistance mechanisms may not be unique for each bacterium, and multiple resistance mechanisms may evolve depending on the compound, which supports previous findings. 2.5. The Self-Resistance Gene-Directed Natural-Product Discovery As an application of the RGDB database, self-resistance gene-directed screening may lead to the identification of BGCs from a vast number of microbial genomes, whose encoded natural products might have potentially higher biological activity due to the resistance. In the Marref genome database, BGCs containing self-resistant genes were first collected through RGDB screening and then analyzed via the GCF [34] method to determine the type of products encoded. Specifically, if a GCF containing a MarRef BGC also includes known BGCs from the MIBiG database, then the known compounds encoded by MIBiG BGCs can be used to predict the types of the natural product encoded by the MarRef BGC, including the chemical scaffolds and their possible interactions with the involved self-resistance genes. The annotation of the resistance mechanisms provides insights into the biological activities of the encoded natural products. Supplementary Table S4 records 51 GCFs that were screened using this method, including 164 MarRef BGCs and encoded natural product frameworks. Table 3 lists three typical examples from the self-resistance gene-directed natural-product discoveries. As the first example, the MarRef BGC was detected with a resistance gene tetB(P), which encodes a tetracycline ribosome protection protein. This gene cluster was assigned to the GCF_01148 family and listed along with the known MIBiG BGC0000853, identified to synthesize the compound ectoine. Therefore, based on the GCF evolutionary relationship, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the product of CP018047.1.region026 may have a chemical scaffold similar to ectoine, which is a potential inhibitor to protein synthesis, thereby exhibiting antibacterial bioactivity. The second example involves five MarRef gene clusters, all containing the ABC-F resistance gene and belonging to the GCF_05426 family. Through the MIBiG gene cluster BGC0001502 in this GCF, it is inferred that these BGCs synthesize an NRP-type compound called amonabactin P 750. The evolutionary analysis thus suggests that these MarRef BGCs can produce similar amonabactin P 750, which should have inhibitory effects on ribosomal protein synthesis. In the final example, the MarRef BGC was assigned to the GCF_07814 family that contains the typical resistance gene aac(3), which encodes an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. The evolutionary analysis indicates that the product scaffold of CP043317.1.region037 is similar to lobophorin A/B, a macrocyclic lactone with antibacterial bioactivity. The bacterium can acquire resistance to this natural product by modifying the transferred aminoglycoside acetyl group. 2.6. Analysis of Resistance Genes in Terpene-Producing BGCs As a diverse class of natural products with a wide range of biological activities produced by microorganisms, it is of great interest to study the coding of terpenoids in marine microbial BGCs and the role they may play in self-resistance. Of the 3878 BGCs screened that contained putative resistance genes, 553 were terpene-producing BGCs. Table 4 shows the selected 4 typical terpenoid BGCs for which resistance genes and products were identified, and details of the 553 BGCs are also listed in Table S3. Figure 3 shows the location of the resistance genes in the gene cluster for these four BGCs, indicating that the location of the resistance genes could occur anywhere in the BGC map. Figure 4 compares the structure of resistance gene proteins with their corresponding reference resistance gene proteins. The RMSD values calculated based on structural comparison ranged from 0.1 to 2 Å, indicating that their structural similarity is very high, verifying that the queried resistance protein may be functionally identical to the reference protein, and the functional annotation of the corresponding resistance gene should also be reliable.',\n",
       " 'PIS mass spectrometry to screen for PHT biosynthetic intermediates PHTs were detected in the cultural supernatants of wild type strain P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A by High resolution mass spectrometry (HR MS) and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The 31P chemical shift of PHTs was 10.94 ppm (Figure S1). Tandem mass spectra (MS2) indicated that species with m/z ratio at 452, 374 and 189 are the characteristic daughter ions of PHTs (m/z ratio at 532) (Fig. 1B). Daughter ions with m/z ratio at 374 and 189 were also observed in the MS3 spectra when desulfonated PHTs (m/z ratio at 452) were further fragmented (Fig. 1C). PHTs characteristic daughter ions with m/z ratio at 374 and 189 were used as queries to screen for PHT biosynthetic intermediates by PIS mass spectrometry. Novel ion with m/z ratio at 417 was detected and tandem mass spectra were further recorded on HR-FT-MS instrument (Fig. 1D,E). Ions with m/z ratio at 417, desulfonated PHTs and PHTs shared two identical daughter ions, m/z ratio at 374 and 189 (Fig. 1F), which are corresponding to the exact mass of tripeptides Orn-Ala-hArg and hArg residues respectively. It indicated that the novel ion with m/z ratio at 417 is a derivate of PHT peptide scaffold Orn-Ala-hArg. Based on exact mass of 417.2568 (Fig. 1E), the side functional group was deduced to be carbamoyl. Carbamylation of Orn-Ala-hArg produced Cit-Ala-hArg, which was a deduced chemical structure of the newly detected ions with m/z ratio at 417. Tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg were by-products of PHT biosynthetic pathway To determine the biosynthetic relationship between tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg and PHTs, P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A genes phtU, phtQ and phtL were in-frame deleted (Figure S2). Neither Cit-Ala-hArg nor PHT was detected from the culture supernatants of phtU- mutant CL001 strain. Gene phtU complementation strain CL004 regained the ability to produce PHTs (Figure S3). Authentic L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg standards feeding restored phtU- mutants with the ability to produce PHTs at 18\\u2009°C, which is the temperature permissive for PHTs synthesis in wild type producers (Fig. 2B). Simultaneously, feeding of L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg and L-Ala- L-hArg restored phtU- mutants with the ability to produce PHTs as well (Figure S3). To the phtQ in-frame deletion, neither Cit-Ala-hArg nor PHT was detected from the culture supernatants of phtQ- mutant strain CL002. Surprisingly, PSOrn was detected from the culture supernatants of phtQ- mutants. HR tandem MS spectra of PSOrn were shown in Fig. 3. None of the authentic oligopeptides described here restored phtQ- mutants with the ability to produce PHTs (Fig. 2C). Meanwhile, gene phtQ complementation strain CL005 regained the ability to produce PHTs (Figure S3). Gene phtL knockout did not abolish phtL- mutant strain CL003 the ability to produce tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg at 18\\u2009°C (Fig. 2D). PhtL is necessary for PHTs biosynthesis since phtL- mutants did not produce any PHT. The accumulated amounts of Cit-Ala-hArg were increased when PHT biosynthesis pathway was blocked in P. syringae pv. phaseolicola phtL- mutants (Fig. 2D). Gene deletion and feeding experiments results described here showed that tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg were by-products accumulated during PHTs biosynthetic process. Dipeptide L-Ala- L-hArg was a joint precursor for the synthesis of both PHT and Cit-Ala-hArg (Fig. 4). Nonspecific aminopeptidase catalyzed hydrolysis of L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg and L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg would release L-Ala- L-hArg. Incorporation of L-Ala- L-hArg into PHT biosynthetic pathway restored phtU- mutants with PHTs producing ability (Fig. 4). Detection of precursor PSOrn from the culture supernatant of phtQ- showed that PhtQ involved in the biosynthesis of PHTs with PSOrn and L-Ala- L-hArg as substrates. Accumulation of by-products Orn-Ala-hArg and Cit-Ala-hArg from the culture supernatants of wild type strains and certain gene in frame deletion mutants might be attributed to the substrate tolerance of PhtQ. We can not rule out the possibility that there are certain uncharacterized peptide ligases participated in the formation of Orn-Ala-hArg and/or Cit-Ala-hArg. PhtL might be involved in the biosynthetic steps of PSOrn with L-Orn as a close precursor. Based on the fact that there is a phtL gene homologous (agnD1 and agnD2) in the biosynthetic gene cluster of another phosphoramidate natural product Agrocin 84282930, we assume that phtL is related to the N-P bonds formation of PHTs. ArgK catalyzed the formation of Tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg To extend our understanding about why such a great amount of by-products were accumulated, it is necessary to address the question concerning formation of tripeptides Cit-Ala-hArg. Two possible mechanisms could be involved to account for this phenomenon. First, PhtQ enzyme is a substrate tolerant peptide ligase and capable of catalyzing the synthesis of Cit-Ala-hArg with Citrulline and dipeptide Ala-hArg as substrates. Second, a potential transcarbamylase catalyzes the carbamylation of Orn-Ala-hArg to form Cit-Ala-hArg. To the PHTs producing Pseudomonas cells, it suffers from Citrulline shortage since the Citrulline formation reaction kcat catalyzed by ArgK reduced to between 1% and 2% of that catalyzed by typical OTCase, such as ArgF31. It is not an economical strategy to produce a great amount of by-product Cit-Ala-hArg by consuming limited Citrulline source. In addition, by-products Cit-Ala-hArg were detected from the cultural supernatants of phtU- as well as phtQ- mutants when Orn-Ala-hArg was added as substrate respectively (Figure S4). Therefore, the OTCase ArgK was suspected to be a main contributor for the formation of by-product Cit-Ala-hArg in vivo. Enzyme assay showed that purified ArgK catalyzed the formation of L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg with L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg and carbamyl phosphates as substrates at 28\\u2009°C in vitro (Fig. 5). The tripeptides L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg production was positively correlated with reaction time, while no detectable amount was observed from the negative control reaction in which ArgK was absent (Fig. 5B). On the contrary, ArgK did not catalyze the reverse reaction in which the system was set up with L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg and orthophosphate as substrate. It indicated that ArgK played dual roles for PHT producers’ self-defense, which the first one was providing alternative Arginine source by acting as functional replacement of ArgF as documented previously131415, and the second one was reducing PHTs production by modifying L-Orn- L-Ala- L-hArg to produce by-products L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg. Exogenous L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg with a concentration range from 1 to 10\\u2009mM did not affect the growth of PHTs producer P. syringae 1448A (Fig. 6). Tripeptides L-Cit- L-Ala- L-hArg were partially consumed by P. syringae cells in the tested conditions. Besides anabolic OTCase ArgF, another catabolic OTCase ArcB has been detected from P. aeruginosa3233. ArcB is involved in the Arginine deiminase pathway and catalyzes the phosphorolysis of Citrulline to produce Ornithine and carbamyl phosphate3435. It is exactly the reverse reaction of that one involved in the Arginine biosynthesis pathway catalyzed by ArgF. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ArgK is more closely related to ArcB of P. aeruginosa PA01 than ArgF of P. syringae (Fig. 7). Comparing with typical anabolic OTCases, amino acid residue substitutions of ArgK were observed in the conserved sites around ornithine binding “SMG” loop31. The newly identified ArgK function announced here accords well with the alteration of substrate binding pocket. PHT resistant and substrate tolerant characters of OTCase ArgK challenge the current paradigm for OTCase.',\n",
       " 'Heterologous expression of VanYn in Streptomyces spp vanYn encoding gene (CAD91202) was amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA template from Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727\\n[12] and cloned in the multicopy vector pIJ86, under the control of the heterologous constitutive promoter ermE*[14]. The gene was cloned in frame with a sequence encoding for a histidine hexamer added at the C-terminus (C-His6-vanYn) or at the N-terminus (N-His6-vanYn) of the protein product. pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn, pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn, and the empty pIJ86 used as a control, were introduced in three different Streptomyces spp. by intergeneric conjugation from E. coli. Streptomyces lividans TK24 was selected as one of the hosts since it is used for heterologous protein production due to its proven excellence in secretion capacity and low extracellular protease activity\\n[15]. Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10595 is a fast growing streptomyces naturally susceptible to glycopeptides\\n[12]. Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) represents the model system\\n[3] and possesses a complete set of vanRSHAX genes conferring high resistance to vancomycin: consequently a glycopeptide susceptible mutant deleted in the two component regulatory system ΔvanRS was used in our experiments\\n[16]. Growth curves at shake flask-scale of the ex-conjugants S. coelicolor ΔvanRS, S. lividans and S. venezuelae carrying pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn or pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn were compared with control strains containing the empty vector in two different cultivation conditions, i.e. by using the limpid YEME medium or the rich and complex BTSB medium (Figure\\xa0\\n1 and Table\\xa0\\n1). Figure\\xa0\\n1A and\\n1B show the growth curves of S. venezuelae recombinant strains, which produced abundant biomass in both the media. Introduction of vanYn slightly affected biomass productivity. Growth kinetics was similar among S. venezuelae carrying either C-His6-vanYn or N-His6-vanYn constructs and the control strain. Maximum biomass production (≥ 30\\xa0g/L dry weight) was achieved after 72\\xa0hours from the inoculum in both YEME and BTSB media. Glucose was consumed with different kinetics between the two media, but it was anyhow completely depleted within 72\\xa0hours of growth. Observation at the optical microscope showed that mycelium in recombinant strains was more fragmented than in the control one (Figure\\xa0\\n1C). Figure 1Growth of S. venezuelae pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn, S. venezuelae pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn and S. venezuelae pIJ86 in YEME (A) and in BTSB (B) at flask level.S. venezuelae pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn dry weight (■ , solid line) and glucose consumption (□, dashed line); S. venezuelae pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn dry weight (● , solid line) and glucose consumption (○, dashed line); S. venezuelae pIJ86 dry weight (♦, solid line) and glucose consumption (◊, dashed line).

Streptomyces spp. recombinant strains carrying different constructs (C-His6-vanYn or N-His6-vanYn) were grown in YEME or BTSB for 72\\xa0hours. VanYn was quantified by immunoblotting on crude extracts as reported in the Methods. Data in Table\\xa0\\n1 shows that S. coelicolor ΔvanRS recombinant strains grew better in BTSB than in YEME, whereas recombinant S. lividans strains did not grow in YEME medium. Different effects of medium composition on growth rate and morphology of suspension cultures (i.e. size of mycelium pellets) among diverse streptomyces hosts have been previously observed\\n[14]. Production of His6-VanYn was evaluated by Western blot analysis after 72\\xa0hours of growth in S. venezuelae, S. coelicolor ΔvanRS and S. lividans recombinant strains. In BTSB medium, recombinant VanYn volumetric and specific productivities ranged between 18 to more than 30\\xa0mg per liter of culture and from 0.8 to more than 1\\xa0mg per gram of cells, within the different recombinant strains. In YEME medium, the highest values of volumetric (about 30\\xa0mg of VanYn per liter of culture) and specific (slightly less than 1\\xa0mg of enzyme per gram of cells) productivities were achieved only for S. venezuelae recombinant strains. Considering that BTSB medium contains complex components which may later on interfere with protein purification, YEME medium was preferred for large-scale protein preparation. Accordingly, S. venezuelae was selected as the preferable host for protein production scaling-up and purification. Cellular localization of His6-VanYn was analyzed after 72\\xa0hours of growth in S. venezuelae, S. coelicolor ΔvanRS and S. lividans recombinant strains by Western blot analysis on different fractions (prepared as described in the Methods section). Figure\\xa0\\n2A shows a\\u2009~\\u200925\\xa0kDa band corresponding to His6-VanYn (predicted molecular mass of native VanYn is 22.1\\xa0kDa) in the insoluble and soluble cell-free fractions and in the cell wall fractions from S. venezuelae recombinant strains grown in YEME medium. Recombinant VanYn was never found in the concentrated broths (extracellular fractions, lanes 1 and 5 of Figure\\xa0\\n2A). Densitometric analysis demonstrated that His6-VanYn preferentially accumulated (90%, lanes 4 and 8 of Figure\\xa0\\n2B) in the cell wall fractions obtained by the step of spheroplast preparation, independently on the localization of the His6-tag (at the C-terminus or at the N-terminus of the protein). Only 6% and 4% of recombinant protein was detected in insoluble and soluble cell-free fractions following spheroplast burst, respectively. For all recombinant strains grown in BTSB or YEME (Table\\xa0\\n1), the heterologous protein distribution was exactly as for S. venezuelae, with most of VanYn recovered from the cell wall fraction (data not shown).

VanYn production by S. venezuelae in 3\\xa0L bench-bioreactor scale Both the forms of recombinant His6-VanYn were produced growing S. venezuelae recombinant strains in YEME medium at 3\\xa0L bench-bioreactor scale. Figures\\xa0\\n3A, B and C show the time course of growth and VanYn production of S. venezuelae carrying pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn. Exponential growth was actually completed within 48\\xa0hours and gave a maximum biomass yield of 40\\xa0g/L dry weight. This growth phase was accompanied by a complete depletion of glucose from the medium and by a transient reduction of dissolved oxygen (pO2). Medium pH slightly decreased during the exponential growth phase and then tended to increase during the stationary growth phase. An estimated maximum of production of\\u2009~\\u200930\\xa0mg VanYn/L in the crude extract was determined at the peak of biomass production, i.e. at 48\\xa0hours from inoculum. An overlapping profile of growth curve and VanYn production was similarly obtained for S. venezuelae carrying pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn (not shown).

VanYn purification from S. venezuelae Purification of both the recombinant forms of His6-VanYn from S. venezuelae cells grown in YEME medium, was attempted by means of metal-chelating chromatography on HiTrap chelating column of crude extracts obtained by whole cell sonication, as described in the Methods section. N-His6-VanYn was eluted following standard procedures. In the same conditions, C-His6-VanYn did not bind to the column, suggesting that the six histidines at C-terminus were masked. Accordingly, a denaturing agent such as urea was added to both the loading and equilibration buffers. The partially denatured C-His6-VanYn protein interacted with the matrix and was subsequently re-folded directly on the column by a linear gradient of decreasing urea concentration. SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure\\xa0\\n4) confirmed that both the tagged forms of His6-VanYn migrated as a single band of 25\\xa0kDa and were\\u2009>\\u200990% pure. Final purification yield was comparable between the two forms: approximately 12\\xa0mg of C- or N-His6-VanYn protein from one liter of culture were recovered.

Enzymatic activity of pure recombinant VanYn Activities of purified C-His6-VanYn and N-His6-VanYn from S. venezuelae recombinant strains were assayed on commercially available surrogates of peptidoglycan precursors, in parallel with the previously characterized C-His6-VanYn produced by recombinant E. coli[17]. These results were obtained by the d-amino acid oxidase/peroxidase colorimetric coupled reaction\\n[18,19], and confirmed by a fluorimetric assay\\n[20]. As shown in Table\\xa0\\n2, C-His6-VanYn from S. venezuelae cleaved the last d-Ala from the tripeptide Nα,Nε-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala and acetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, this activity being only slightly affected by the acetylation grade of the Lys. The activity was halved if the substrate was the d-Ala-d-Ala. Thus, C-His6-VanYn showed a higher d,d-carboxypeptidase activity (VanY-like) than a d,d-peptidase activity (VanX-like). Surprisingly, N-His6-VanYn from S. venezuelae did not show any activity on the three substrates (Table\\xa0\\n2), suggesting that the tag position dramatically influenced enzyme competence.

The activity was assayed at 25°C as described in the Methods section. Results are the average of three independent experiments. These results were supported by the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the recombinant proteins. CD spectrum of C-His6-VanYn produced in S. venezuelae overlapped with that of the protein produced in E. coli (Figure\\xa0\\n5): analysis of secondary structure indicates a predominance of β-sheets (~ 38%) and\\u2009~\\u200915% of α-helices. This structure content was altered for the N-His6-VanYn (Figure\\xa0\\n5), indicating that N-terminal tag interfered with the proper protein folding and secondary structure content of the recombinant enzyme.

Resistance phenotype in S. venezuelae recombinant strains Role of different constructs of vanYn, when over-expressed in a glycopeptide-susceptible heterologous host such as S. venezuelae, was investigated in vivo by determining the d,d-peptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase activity of alkaline cell extracts and the glycopeptide resistance phenotype of recombinant strains. As shown in Table\\xa0\\n3, d,d-peptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase activity was detectable only in S. venezuelae pIJ86ΩC-His6-vanYn and S. venezuelae pIJ86ΩvanYn (a strain with vanYn cloned without any tag, see\\n[12]), but not in S. venezuelae pIJ86ΩN-His6-vanYn neither in S. venezualae wild-type or in S. venezualae containing the empty vector. Table\\xa0\\n3 also reports the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of vancomycin and teicoplanin to the recombinant strains in comparison with the wild-type. Accordingly to the expression of the d,d-peptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase activity, S. venezuelae expressing C-His6-VanYn and S. venezuelae producing VanYn without any tag showed an increased resistance level against both glycopeptides.

       " 'The main goals of this work were to test if Tei3 acts as a non-inducible phosphorylase and to investigate which ligand could be sensed by Tei3. Considering A. teichomyceticus a challenging microorganism for gene-engineering manipulations, a series of genetic experiments were designed and performed in heterologous hosts such as S. coelicolor M512 [38] and S. coelicolor J3200 [31]. As anticipated in the introduction, S. coelicolor has a full set of van genes conferring vancomycin resistance, although it does not produce any GPAs [39]. S. coelicolor M512 does not produce the pigmented antibiotics actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin [38], permitting the use of a β-glucuronidase (GusA)-based reporter assay, as described below. The second strain—J3200—is the ΔvanSSc mutant, in which the host vanS gene was knocked out [31]. Thus, the experimental steps described below aimed: (1) to test if the heterologous Tei3 can cross-phosphorylate the host VanRSc; (2) to build a gusA-based reporter S. coelicolor strain, able to convert X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide) to 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dichloro-indigo following GPA induction; (3) to utilize the created reporter strain to show if Tei3 needs the presence of GPAs or not; (4) to replace the SD of the host VanSSc with its counterpart from Tei3 and test which GPAs may act as ligands for Tei3 SD. 2.1. Heterologous Expression of Tei3 SHK Leads to Teicoplanin and A40926 Resistance in S. coelicolor M512 VanRS-like two-component regulatory pairs are conserved enough among actinobacteria to show a certain degree of cross-talking [33,40]. For example, it was shown that VanRSc (coming from S. coelicolor) could be phosphorylated in vivo by VanSSt (from A47934 producer S. toyocaensis), but not vice versa, implying that VanRSc is accessible for non-cognate SHKs [33]. In this case, SHKs and RRs both came from Streptomyces spp. Instead, it was necessary to check if Tei3 SHK from A. teichomyceticus (order Micromonosporales) could phosphorylate VanRSc. Overall, Tei2 and Tei3 share a high percentage of aa sequence identity with VanRSc and VanSSc: 91% and 67%, respectively. Tei3 and VanSSc are collinear, sharing highly similar transmembrane helix (TMHs) regions and conserved putative autophosphorylation sites (Figure 1a). The most divergent region between Tei3 and VanSSc is the extracytoplasmic sensory loop (ESL), implying that quite different ligands should be recognized by the two proteins (Figure 1a). At the same time, Tei2 and VanRSc were almost identical (Figure 1b). Thus, it seems plausible that Tei3 would be able to phosphorylate VanRSc in vivo. To test if Tei3 can phosphorylate the non-cognate RR—VanRSc, tei3 was cloned into the pSET152A vector, giving pGP101, and then transferred into S. coelicolor M512. The obtained recombinant strain—S. coelicolor M101—gained teicoplanin and A40926 resistance, in addition to the endogenous vancomycin resistance (Figure 2). Consequently, it could be concluded that Tei3 phosphorylates VanRSc in vivo. However, this experiment did not clarify whether Tei3 acts as a constitutive phosphorylase, considering that teicoplanin and A40926 added to the plates could serve as its activators. 2.2. Tei3 Acts as a Non-Inducible Phosphorylase Expression of tei2-3-4 and tei7-6-5 operons remains stable throughout the life cycle of A. teichomyceticus, independently from the teicoplanin concentration [35,37], pathway-specific regulation [36], and growth phase [37]. Previous papers speculated about the need of a strong constitutive promoter driving tei2-3-4 expression [37] or of the presence of specific mutations in Tei3 that might explain its function as a constitutive phosphorylase, working independently from the presence of any extracellular GPA [35]. Protein sequence comparison indicated that Tei3 carries single aa substitutions in two sites where analogous mutations transform the vancomycin-inducible VanSSc into a constitutive phosphorylase [35]. Specifically, these are L216P and G271V substitutions [31]. Homologous sites in Tei3 are N215 and R270 (Figure 1a). However, there are multiple other sites within the putative ATPase domain (ATPaseD) of Tei3, which significantly diverged from VanSSc (see Figure 1a). To experimentally verify the GPA inducibility of Tei3, a bioassay responding to the inducers of van genes was first developed in S. coelicolor. Other authors previously described a reporter S. coelicolor strain, where the endogenous vanJ promoter (vanJp) was cloned into a multicopy plasmid, fused with the kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene—neo—in a way that induction of vanJp by vancomycin conferred resistance to both neomycin and kanamycin [39]. Using this experience, either vanJp or the other endogenous vancomycin-responsive S. coelicolor vanHAX promoter (vanHp) was fused with the gusA gene, coding for a β-glucuronidase in the pGUS chassis [44]. vanJp or vanHp activation by GPAs in the reporter strain should activate the chromogenic conversion of the X-Gluc substrate into the green-colored 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dichloro-indigo [44]. Thus, plasmids pGHp (carrying vanHp-gusA) and pGJp (carrying vanJp-gusA) were transferred to S. coelicolor M512 by means of intergeneric conjugation with Escherichia coli ET12567 pUZ8002+. The inducibility of the two generated reporter strains S. coelicolor pGHp+ and pGJp+ was first tested in liquid medium and then in solid plates. When vancomycin was added at 10 µg/mL to 50 h old cultures in TSB liquid medium, the basal glucuronidase activity of the mycelia was increased by, ca., twenty- and forty-fold, in S. coelicolor pGHp+ and pGJp+, respectively (Figure S1), indicating that vanJp seems more responsive to vancomycin than vanHp. In solid media containing 25 µg/mL of X-Gluc, the presence of vancomycin induced vanJp-mediated glucuronidase activity in recombinant strains, yielding green halos around the Whatman discs soaked in antibiotic solution (Figure 3 and Figure S2). S. coelicolor pGJp+ acted very well as a reporter, giving a detectable chromogenic conversion in response to very low concentrations of vancomycin (250 ng, Figure S2), whereas S. coelicolor pGHp+ resulted as much less responsive to vancomycin (data not shown) and, thus, it was not further used. The next step was transferring Tei3 into S. coelicolor pGJp+ to test if its activity is inducible by GPAs. As either pGJp or pGP101 is a distant derivative of pSET152 [45], both plasmids use the φC31 attB site for integration and are not compatible. To solve this issue, the pRT801 plasmid [46] was used to create a φBT1-based derivative of pGP101, named pGP111. The M512 derivative carrying pGP111 (carrying tei3) was named M111, while the strain carrying both pGP111 and pGJp was named M1J. It was expected that if Tei3 functions as a constitutive phosphorylase, M1J would express a constitutive glucuronidase activity in the presence of X-Gluc, not depending on the presence or absence of GPAs. This assumption was correct as M1J converted X-Gluc independently from the presence of any GPA (Figure 3), confirming in vivo that Tei3 functions as a constitutive phosphorylase. As a control, it was shown that no induction was observed in those strains not carrying vanJp-gusA (M512 and M111), whereas the GPA induction was observed in S. coelicolor pGJp+ due to the action of the endogenous VanSSc. 2.3. Loss of Extracytoplasmic Sensory Loop and Transmembrane Helices Renders Tei3 and VanSSc Nonfunctional Considering the non-inducible properties of Tei3, we were wondering whether TMHs and ESL are still necessary for its function, or whether ATPaseD would be the only required domain. To answer this question, a series of plasmids was created carrying truncated versions of tei3 or of vanSSc lacking (i) TMH1 and ESL (tei3′, vanSSc′); (ii) TMH1, ESL, and TMH2 (tei3″, vanSSc″) (Figure S3). These plasmids were named pGP104 (tei3′), pGP105 (vanSSc′), pGP106 (tei3″), and pGP107 (vanSSc″). Plasmids were transferred into S. coelicolor M512 (resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to teicoplanin and A40926) and S. coelicolor J3200 (this last one—ΔvanSSc—is constitutively resistant to all GPAs), generating M104-107 and J104-107 strains. It was expected that if ATPaseD of Tei3 would be able to function alone, the expression of tei3′ and tei3″ might lead to constitutive GPA resistance in M512. On the contrary, the absence of the SD in VanSSc might render J3200 constitutively sensitive to GPAs. However, the obtained results indicated that ATPaseDs of neither Tei3 nor VanSSc can function alone: the phenotypes of M104-107 and J104-107 strains in the presence of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and A40926 were the same as the parental M512 and J3200 strains, respectively (Figure 4). 2.4. Tei3 Sensor Domain Is Sensitive to A40926 but Not to Teicoplanin and Vancomycin Logically, teicoplanin should be the original ligand for Tei3. However, direct experimental verification of this assumption is impossible due to the non-inducible properties of Tei3. It is possible that maybe Tei3 became a constitutive phosphorylase in the course of the evolution, but clues for Tei3 sensitivity might have remained “fossilized” within its SD. To answer this question, a hybrid gene coding for a chimeric SHK combining the SD of Tei3 with the ATPaseD of VanSSc was created. vanSSc and tei3 (Figure S4) were collinear, facilitating such an exchange. Luckily, a unique PaeI recognition site was found only 4 bp after the vanSSc region coding for SD. This allowed us to use this site for replacing the vanSSc region coding for the SD with the corresponding one from tei3 (see Section 4 for details). The obtained hybrid gene—tei3-vanSSc (Figure S4)—was cloned into the pSET152A plasmid generating pGP103. Next, pGP103 was transferred into M512 and J3200 generating the recombinant strains M103 and J103, respectively. In the first case, a merodiploid strain was generated, carrying the native vanSSc together with the hybrid tei3-vanSSc allele, while in J3200, the knockout of vanSSc was complemented by the added tei3-vanSSc. GPA resistance phenotypes of these recombinants showed that both M103 and J103 became sensitive to vancomycin, implying that this GPA is not an inducer for the Tei3 SD (Figure 5). Surprisingly, M103 and J103 were also sensitive to teicoplanin, excluding its possible role as a ligand for the Tei3 SD. Adding a final detail to these puzzling results, both M103 and J103 were resistant to A40926, implying that the Tei3 SD recognizes A40926 as a ligand. 2.5. Establishing a Link between the Evolution of Glycosylation Pattern of Teicoplanin and Properties of Tei3 SD Teicoplanin and A40926 are chemically similar GPAs that likely emerged in the course of convergent evolution (Figure S5) [47,48,49]. Differences lie in the chlorination and methylation pattern; notably, A40926 also lacks a N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety attached to the aglycone of teicoplanin at the aa position 6 (AA6) (Figure S5). The glycosylation pattern might be important for binding VanS, in accordance with previous results reporting that VanS from S. toyocaensis was unable to recognize vancomycin, sensing only the non-glycosylated A47934 [33]. Hence, it could be speculated that the responsiveness of Tei3 to a GPA lacking a GlcNAc residue might be an ancient property from the times when the ancestral teicoplanin BGC did not carry a gene for the attachment of the GlcNAc moiety at aglycone AA6. To understand this better, the phylogeny of glycosyl transferases (GTFs) coming from experimentally studied GPA BGCs was reconstructed (Figure 6). Five clades (A–D) might be delineated on the obtained tree (Figure 6) and they seem to correspond to the regiospecificity of GTFs well. The regiospecificity of clades (A–C) GTFs could be predicted with high confidence as, for many members of these clades, experimental evidence exists. Thus, clade (A) comprehended GTFs attaching either d-glucose or GlcNAc to AA4 of the GPA aglycone (see [50] for the review of such GTFs); clade (B) GTFs are responsible for the attachment of l-aminosugars to AA4 d-glucose [50]; clade (C) included GTFs from ristocetin BGCs likely attaching d-arabinose to AA4 d-mannosyl-d-glucose [51] (Figure 6). The substrate- and regiospecificity of GTFs from clades (D) and (E) were dubious: clade (D) GTFs probably attach l-rhamnose to the AA4 d-glucose, while clade (E) GTFs may attach l-aminosugars to aglycone AA6. To our surprise, Tei1—known to attach the GlcNAc moiety at the teicoplanin aglycone AA6 [52]—was found deep in clade (A), being a sister branch to Tei10* (known to attach GlcNAc at AA4). One other GPA—GP1416 from Amycolatopsis sp. WAC01416 [53]—is known to closely resemble the teicoplanin structure, bearing the GlcNAc moiety at AA6. However, the GTF that is likely responsible for this did not belong to any of the clades and was located far from either Tei1 or Tei10* (Figure 6). The presence of the GlcNAc moiety at AA6 of teicoplanin and GP1416 could, thus, be considered an example of the convergent evolution of GPAs. Considering all mentioned above, one could reasonably assume that Tei1 is a recent product of the Tei10* duplication/divergence event. In the course of evolution, it is likely that Tei1 changed its regiospecificity but retained the substrate specificity. A direct ancestor of teicoplanin BGC likely coded the biosynthesis of des-GlcNAc-teicoplanin, which structurally resembles A40926 and was recognized by the Tei3 SD (see Figure 7 and the discussion below for a possible reconstruction of co-evolution of GTFs encoded in teicoplanin BGC and Tei3).',\n",
       " 'SCPCHD adducts stabilize the DNA duplex through a network of CH-π interactions The five known SCPCHD natural products can be divided into three sub-types based on the number and arrangement of the indole and pyrroloindole subunits (Fig.\\xa01a). To better understand how these differences affect toxicity and repair, we selected one compound from eac`h group for biochemical and biophysical characterization (Fig.\\xa02). We previously demonstrated that a single YTM adduct in a short oligonucleotide retains a B-DNA conformation and dramatically increases the stability of the duplex, providing an explanation for why these lesions are poorly repaired by the NER pathway18,46. Similarly, earlier work showed that multiple CC-1065 adducts greatly increase the melting temperature of genomic DNA19. To directly compare the effects of the different SCPCHD sub-types on DNA stability and structure, we introduced a single YTM, DSA, or CC-1065 adduct onto a central adenine within the same GC-rich DNA dodecamer. The circular dichroism spectra of each construct showed negative and positive bands at ~240 and 270\\u2009nm, respectively, indicative of B-form DNA47 (Fig.\\xa02a). Additional features in the spectra likely result from either minor structural perturbation of the DNA or dichroism of the SCPCHD adducts themselves, which produce broad peaks above 300\\u2009nm in the absorbance spectra (Fig.\\xa02b). To assess the effect of each compound on duplex stability, thermal denaturation was monitored by an increase in absorbance at 260\\u2009nm (Fig.\\xa02c). Relative to unmodified DNA, the presence of a single DSA, YTM, or CC-1065 adduct increased the melting temperature by 23, 36, or ≥41\\u2009°C, respectively. The increase in duplex stability correlated with the stability of the adduct. After 28 days at 30\\u2009°C, only 16%, 11%, and 8%, respectively, of DSA, YTM, and CC-1065 adducts had spontaneously depurinated (Fig.\\xa02d and Supplementary Fig.\\xa01). For comparison, the half-life of 3-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine in genomic DNA is <4 days under similar conditions (interpolated from previously published rates at 22\\u2009°C and 39\\u2009°C)48.Fig. 2Characterization of DNA adducts produced by YTM, DSA, and CC-1065.a, b Circular dichroism (a) and absorbance (b) spectra of unmodified and alkylated DNA collected at 15\\u2009°C. c Thermal melting profiles of unmodified and alkylated DNA.

To elucidate the structural and chemical origins of these trends, we modeled each of the constructs by manually docking ideal B-form DNA and SCPCHD adducts taken from crystallographic AlkD product complexes (described below) (Fig.\\xa02e). Despite being maintained as rigid bodies, all adducts fit in the minor groove without steric clashes. In these hypothetical models, the hydrophilic edges of the subunits are exposed to solvent, whereas the hydrophobic faces are sandwiched between the backbones of the two DNA strands. As we previously described with YTM adducts18, this arrangement creates an extended network of CH-π interactions. Although these interactions are individually often weak (~1\\u2009kcal/mol)49, the combined strength of many such interactions generates a strong energy barrier to duplex denaturation and lesion depurination. Indeed, DNA stability and lesion half-life correlate with the number of nucleotides that form CH-π interactions (Fig.\\xa02f). Thus, this network of weak interactions explains the trends in duplex stability and nucleotide half-life that we observe with each adduct. Importantly, our models and conclusions are consistent with a previously published NMR structure of DSA-DNA (PDB accession 1DSA)50. (Supplementary Fig.\\xa02), which further highlights the importance of CH-π interactions on the stability of SCPCHD-modified DNA duplexes. Relative to ideal B-form DNA, the DSA adduct in the experimental structure induces a slight narrowing of the minor groove and twisting of the DNA backbone, which maximizes the number and strength of the CH-π interactions formed between the adduct and the DNA. Thus, through a network of CH-π interactions, SCPCHD adducts create an induced fit in the minor groove that tethers the opposing DNA strands and prevents gross deformation to the B-DNA conformation, explaining how these adducts pose a significant challenge to repair by the UvrABC NER excinuclease18. YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to provide self-resistance against YTM and CC-1065 Historically, bulky DNA lesions, such as SCPCHD adducts, have been regarded as substrates for the NER pathway51–54. However, we previously showed that NER provides Bacillus anthracis with only limited resistance against YTM, while AlkD-mediated BER provides a modest degree of additional resistance18. At the time, we speculated the AlkD homologs that evolved in antibiotic-producing bacteria would provide greater resistance against their SCPCHD natural products. To test this theory, we transformed Escherichia coli with either an empty plasmid or a plasmid encoding AlkD, YtkR2, or C10R5, and incubated the cultures with various concentrations of YTM, DSA, or CC-1065 (Supplementary Fig.\\xa03). Sensitivity to the compounds was scored as the lag time, or delay prior to exponential cell growth55,56 (Fig.\\xa03). In the absence of any drug, cell growth was unchanged regardless of the protein being expressed. Conversely, cells transformed with only an empty vector showed different degrees of resistance against the three SCPCHD compounds. As previously observed with eukaryotic cells13, YTM was the most toxic, inhibiting growth at the lowest drug concentration, followed by CC-1065 and then DSA. In cultures containing YTM, only YtkR2 provided clear and significant resistance, shortening the lag phase before exponential growth. Similarly, in cultures containing CC-1065, C10R5 provided the greatest resistance, although YtkR2, and to a much lesser extent AlkD, also provided additional resistance. The same trend was observed in cultures containing DSA; C10R5 provided the greatest resistance, followed by YtkR2 and then AlkD. These data are consistent with the notion that YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to provide self-resistance against YTM and CC-1065, respectively. However, both proteins also confer substantial resistance against DSA, and YtkR2 provides moderate resistance against CC-1065. This lack of specificity suggests that the features of YtkR2 and C10R5 responsible for drug resistance are largely independent of the differences between the SCPCHD compounds. The only exception to this generalization appears to be the lack of resistance against YTM provided by C10R5.Fig. 3Determination of drug resistance.E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with either an empty plasmid (blank) or a plasmid encoding AlkD, YtkR2, or C10R5 were grown in the presence of various concentrations of YTM, DSA, or CC-1065.

Product affinity inversely correlates with cellular resistance To understand how YtkR2 and C10R5 confer greater resistance than AlkD to SCPCHD natural products, we measured in vitro excision activity using purified proteins and defined oligonucleotide substrates (Fig.\\xa04a,b and Supplementary Fig.\\xa04). Under single-turnover conditions, in which the enzymes are in molar excess of the DNA substrates, both AlkD and YtkR2 rapidly excised all three adducts, approaching the endpoints of the reactions within 15\\u2009s (Fig.\\xa04c, Supplementary Fig.\\xa05, and Supplementary Table\\xa01). C10R5 rapidly excised DSA and CC-1065 lesions, albeit more slowly than AlkD and YtkR2, but removed YTM adducts at a substantially reduced rate. Under multiple-turnover conditions, in which the DNA substrates are in molar excess of the enzymes, the results were strikingly different (Fig.\\xa04d, Supplementary Fig.\\xa06, and Supplementary Table\\xa01). Although AlkD rapidly excised a molar equivalent of each adduct (i.e., the first turnover in which ~10% product is formed), subsequent turnovers occurred several orders of magnitude more slowly. Excision of adducts by YtkR2 was similarly slowed, although to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, the multiple-turnover rates of removal of DSA and CC-1065 lesions by C10R5 were effectively unchanged; only the rate of excision of YTM adducts was substantially reduced. Thus, under single-turnover conditions, all homologs have the capacity for rapid excision of diverse SCPCHD lesions, although this capacity appears to be reduced in C10R5, and inefficient substrate recognition by C10R5 seemingly further slows removal of YTM lesions. For all homologs, there is only weak correlation between rates of single-turnover excision and cellular resistance (Figs.\\xa03 and 4c, and Supplementary Table\\xa01). Conversely, the multiple-turnover rates of the three enzymes are strongly correlated with their cellular resistance against each SCPCHD compound (Figs.\\xa03 and 4d, and Supplementary Table\\xa01).Fig. 4Measurement of adduct excision activity.a Sequence specificity of SCPCHD natural products.

We previously demonstrated that slow multiple turnover by AlkD was correlated with inhibition of AP endonuclease activity in vitro, which we attributed to tight binding of the AP product generated upon base excision18,57. The substantially faster multiple turnover that we observed with YtkR2 and C10R5 therefore suggests that product affinity is weaker for these homologs. To test this possibility, we performed AP-DNA incision assays using the AP endonuclease EndoIV and either AP-DNA generated from each of the SCPCHD adducts or tetrahydrofuran (THF)-DNA containing an AP analog (Fig.\\xa04e and Supplementary Fig.\\xa07). Reaction mixtures with THF-DNA were supplemented with free 3-methyladenine (3mAde) nucleobase to approximate the nucleobase adducts excised from the SCPCHD lesions, while also providing a basis to assess the effects of the excised SCPCHD adducts on product affinity. Relative to AP-DNA produced by AlkD, AP-DNA generated by YtkR2 or C10R5 was incised by EndoIV to a substantially greater extent, regardless of which SCPCHD adduct was excised to produce the abasic site, consistent with relatively weak product binding by YtkR2 and C10R5. For each of the homologs, AP-DNA generated from DSA-DNA was cleaved to the greatest extent, which could be explained by DSA-Ade being bound by each of the homologs with weaker affinity, producing a less stable ternary product complex, and/or by DSA-Ade inhibiting AP-DNA incision by EndoIV to a lesser degree. The former would be consistent with the fewer observed or predicted protein-adduct binding interactions formed with DSA-Ade (described below), whereas the latter would be consistent with the fewer predicted CH-π interactions formed with DSA (Fig.\\xa02e, f). Unlike AP-DNA, the extent to which THF-DNA was incised by EndoIV was independent of which DNA glycosylase homolog was present, and no additional THF-DNA was incised in reactions mixtures in which AlkD, YtkR2, and C10R5 were omitted (Fig.\\xa04e and Supplementary Fig.\\xa07), indicating product affinity is greater for abasic DNA in the presence of the excised SCPCHD adducts. Taken together, the base excision and AP-DNA incision data suggest that YtkR2 and C10R5 evolved to possess lower product affinities than AlkD for abasic DNA derived from SCPCHD lesions. Moreover, this apparently reduced product affinity correlates with the increased cellular resistance provided by these specialized homologs (Figs.\\xa03 and 4d,e). Diverse SCPCHD adducts are recognized primarily through nonspecific interactions To understand AlkD’s lack of specificity for the three SCPCHD sub-types and comparatively high product affinity, we determined crystal structures of AlkD bound to DNA containing each of the three adducts. We previously reported the structure of AlkD bound to AP-DNA and YTM-Ade (PDB accession 5UUG)18 and now report structures of AlkD bound to AP-DNA and either DSA-Ade or CC1065-Ade (Fig.\\xa05 and Supplementary Table\\xa02). Product complexes were generated by incubating AlkD with the corresponding DNA substrates, allowing for enzymatic hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond and formation of an AP site and a free nucleobase adduct (Fig.\\xa05a). The conformations of AlkD and the abasic DNA are effectively identical in the three structures (Fig.\\xa05b and Supplementary Fig.\\xa08). Relative to the substrate models (Fig.\\xa02e), binding by AlkD bends the B-DNA helix by ~30° and widens the minor groove by 4–5\\u2009Å, disrupting the CH-π interactions between the adducts and the modified strand, and enabling the three catalytic residues—Trp109, Asp113, and Trp187—to contact the modified nucleotide18,43,58. Despite this remodeling, the excised nucleobases remain stacked in the DNA duplex, with the bulky SCPCHD adducts bound within an extended cleft between the concave surface of the protein and the minor groove of the DNA.Fig. 5Comparison of AlkD product complexes.a Excised SCPCHD adducts from the crystallographic AlkD product complexes.

Within the SCPCHD binding cleft, 14 protein residues contact one or more of the adducts (Fig.\\xa05c). Only three—Gln38, Lys156, and Lys194—form adduct-specific hydrogen-bonding interactions. Gln38 interacts with the hydroxyl and methoxy substituents of the S−1 subunit unique to YTM, while Lys194 interacts with the methoxy substituent of the S+2 subunit unique to CC-1065. Otherwise, Gln38 and Lys194 function as DNA-binding residues. Lys156 contacts all three adducts but only forms a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the hydroxyl substituent specific to the S+1 subunit of CC-1065. In YTM and DSA, this position is occupied by a methoxy group, forcing Lys156 to adopt a different rotamer that hydrogen bonds with the DNA backbone. All other hydrogen bonds between the adducts and the protein are mediated by water. Additional recognition of the adducts occurs through hydrophobic contacts and CH-π interactions. The majority of these binding interactions involve the S0 and S+1 subunits present in all of the SCPCHD adducts. Of seemingly principal importance are Tyr27, Met28, Trp109, Asp110, Leu155, and Trp187. Together, these residues form a shelf below the adducts and provide an alternative network of CH-π interactions, replacing the network of CH-π interactions that is disrupted upon binding of the DNA by AlkD and widening of the minor groove. Thus, AlkD’s substrate-binding cleft can accommodate each SCPCHD compound with strikingly few adduct-specific interactions. This lack of specificity is consistent with AlkD’s similar rates of excision for the three substrates. To explain the structural basis for cellular resistance against SCPCHD compounds provided by YtkR2 and C10R5, the AlkD product complexes were used as templates to create homology models of both homologs bound to abasic DNA and each of the nucleobase adducts (Supplementary Fig.\\xa09). Despite the low sequence identity (19–25%) among the three proteins, the only putative structural difference of note is an extended loop between helices αI and αJ in both YtkR2 and C10R5. The three homologs appear to share the same three catalytic residues and a high conservation among DNA-binding residues, although YtkR2 and C10R5 possess fewer apparent DNA-binding residues (15 and 14, respectively) than the 18 present in AlkD. Within the substrate-binding cleft, the largest variation predicted by the homology models is in the residues that contact the SCPCHD adducts. However, despite this variation, YtkR2 and C10R5 seemingly form few specific interactions with any of the adducts, including the adduct that each evolved to excise. The only putative hydrogen-bonding interactions between YtkR2 and YTM are formed between Arg42 and the hydroxyl and methoxy substituents of the S−1 subunit. Similarly, the only likely hydrogen-bonding interactions between C10R5 and CC-1065 are formed between Lys159, Arg205, and the hydroxyl and methoxy substituents of the S+1 and S+2 subunits. Surprisingly, all of the adduct-binding residues in YtkR2 and C10R5 that appear to be specific for YTM and CC-1065 are equivalent to the three DNA-binding residues in AlkD that form similar interactions with YTM-Ade and CC1065-Ade (Fig.\\xa05c and Supplementary Fig.\\xa09). As with AlkD, the remainder of the binding interactions are composed of water-mediated hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, and CH-π interactions. This apparent lack of structural specificity, combined with the nearly complete lack of specificity observed in the excision assays, suggests the enhanced cellular resistance provided by YtkR2 and C10R5 does not result from enhanced recognition of a particular SCPCHD adduct. Instead, the additional cellular resistance provided by YtkR2 and C10R5 seems more likely to result from decreased product affinity, which may be explained, at least in part, by the reduced number of predicted DNA-binding residues in these homologs (Supplementary Fig.\\xa09). It is also possible that other, more subtle, structural factors that are not apparent from the homology models may play a role. C10R5 poorly accommodates the unique arrangement of subunits in YTM The only significant indication of substrate specificity by any of the three homologs was C10R5’s relatively slow excision of YTM-Ade adducts in vitro and corresponding lack of YTM resistance in cells. Given the structural differences between the SCPCHD natural products, we postulated that unfavorable interactions between C10R5 and the S−1 subunit unique to YTM were likely responsible for this reduced activity. Comparison of the YtkR2 and C10R5 homology models indicated three residues (Phe22, Ser25, and Ala40) in C10R5 that were likely to contact the S−1 subunit and that were not conserved in either YtkR2 or AlkD (Fig.\\xa06a–c and Supplementary Fig.\\xa09). To determine the influence of these residues on substrate specificity, we mutated them to the corresponding residues in YtkR2 and measured YTM-Ade excision under modified single- and multiple-turnover conditions (Fig.\\xa06d,e, Supplementary Figs.\\xa010 and 11, and Supplementary Table\\xa03). Under single-turnover conditions, both the F22T and S25G single mutants exhibited a modest increase in YTM-Ade excision activity relative to wild-type C10R5. This effect was further enhanced in the F22T-S25G double mutant. Moreover, the increased activity of the C10R5 F22T-S25G double mutant toward YTM-Ade was within five-fold of wild-type C10R5’s activity toward CC1065-Ade (Supplementary Tables\\xa01 and 3). In contrast, an A40R single mutant and an F22T-S25G-A40R triple mutant displayed decreased YTM-Ade excision activity relative to the wild-type enzyme and the F22T-S25G double mutant, respectively. Under multiple-turnover conditions, all C10R5 single mutants, including A40R, exhibited increased YTM-Ade excision activity, which was further increased in the F22T-S25G double mutant. As observed under single-turnover conditions, the F22T-S25G-A40R triple mutant displayed reduced YTM-Ade excision activity relative to the double mutant. Despite this reduction, the YTM-Ade excision activity of the triple mutant was comparable to that of YtkR2 under multiple-turnover conditions, whereas the YTM-Ade excision activities of the F22T single mutant and the F22T-S25G double mutant were slightly greater than that of YtkR2 (Supplementary Tables\\xa01 and 3). These comparatively rapid multiple-turnover rates, however, are likely more indicative of C10R5’s apparently low product affinity than vastly improved YTM recognition, as the rates at which these mutants removed YTM-Ade is more than 11-fold slower than the rates at which wild-type C10R5 removed CC1065-Ade and DSA-Ade. Moreover, under single-turnover conditions, the YTM-Ade excision activity of YtkR2 vastly exceeded that of all C10R5 mutants. Thus, although the substitutions (F22T and S25G) that increased the volume of the adduct-binding cleft also increased the rate of YTM-Ade excision, suggesting that C10R5’s low activity for YTM-Ade is dictated by a sterically constrained binding cleft at the position of the S−1 subunit, additional unfavorable interactions may also be hindering recognition of YTM lesions (Supplementary Figs.\\xa08 and 9), preventing more rapid excision of YTM-Ade adducts.Fig. 6Molecular basis of C10R5 substrate specificity.a, b Close-up views of YtkR2 (a) and C10R5 (b) homology models bound to AP-DNA and YTM-Ade.

To determine the biological relevance of the gain-of-activity mutations, we transformed E. coli with either an empty plasmid or a plasmid encoding YtkR2, C10R5, C10R5 F22T\\xa0S25G, or C10R5 F22T\\xa0S25G A40R, and incubated cells on solid medium containing various concentrations of YTM (Fig.\\xa06f and Supplementary Fig.\\xa012). In the absence of YTM, cell growth was unaffected by the protein construct being expressed. In the presence of YTM, YtkR2 provided the greatest resistance, whereas cells containing an empty plasmid were the most sensitive. As in our growth experiments in liquid medium (Fig.\\xa03 and Supplementary Fig.\\xa03), wild-type C10R5 provided little to no resistance to YTM (Fig.\\xa06f and Supplementary Fig.\\xa012). The C10R5 double mutant, however, provided clear resistance, albeit less than YtkR2. Consistent with our YTM-Ade excision assays (Fig.\\xa06d, e), the C10R5 triple mutant provided less resistance than the double mutant, and only arguably provided more resistance than wild-type C10R5 (Fig.\\xa06f and Supplementary Fig.\\xa012). These relatively modest increases in YTM resistance may be limited by a number of factors, including potentially reduced expression and/or solubility of the mutant proteins. Regardless, these cellular results validate our structural and biochemical conclusions, showing homology-based mutations that likely only eliminate steric clashes between C10R5 and YTM—without introducing specific adduct-binding interactions—are able to increase the YTM resistance conferred by C10R5.',\n",
       " \"Genome mining of strain Tü 2108 leads to the identification of a berninamycin BGC and provides information on berninamycin derivative biosynthesis In a previous study, we established a bioreporter assay panel, suitable for MoA profiling of antibacterial agents, which are secreted into the agar by producer strains. This procedure was used to screen strains from the Tübingen actinomycetes strain collection for novel natural compounds (5). Here, we used the bioreporter strain B. subtilis PbmrC-lacZ that specifically responds to protein synthesis inhibition, or more precisely to ribosomal stalling, as a metabolic stress signal (5). Antibiotic activity was indicated by a zone of growth inhibition in the bioreporter lawn, while the inhibitory effect on protein synthesis was signaled by a blue halo around the inhibition zone as a result of brmC promoter activation that drives β-galactosidase reporter gene expression and associated color change (5). Strain Tü 2108 emerged in this MoA-informed screening process as one of the strains, which yielded a large inhibition zone and a clear blue halo (Figure 1). The implicated PSI produced by the strain was identified as berninamycin C by HPLC-MS analysis (5). For the characterization of the Tü 2108 producer organism, the genomic DNA was sequenced and the full-length genome sequence was analyzed bioinformatically for phylogenetic classification and identification of BGCs. Genome-sequence-based phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Type (Strain) Genome Server v. 1.0 (TYGS) (https://tygs.dsmz.de) (35). TYGS analysis with the genome sequence of Tü 2108 revealed that the strain is most closely related to the type strain Streptomyces atroolivaceus NRRL ISP-5137T (Figure 2). The dDDH value (formula d4) between Tü 2108 and S. atroolivaceus NRRL ISP-5137T was 84.6%, which is above the threshold of 70% commonly used for species delineation. Thus, Tü 2108 belongs to the same species as S. atroolivaceus NRRL ISP-5137T, which has already been described as a berninamycin producer strain (41). To investigate if the berninamycin BGC is present in Tü 2108, the genome sequence was analyzed with the bioinformatic tool antiSMASH v. 6.0 (15), which led to the identification of 38 BGCs, whereby the predicted BGC located on region 6_3 (BGC 6_3) showed ∼100% similarity to the berninamycin A BGC of the berninamycin producer strain Streptomyces bernensis (Supplementary Figure S1, Figure 3). Manual sequence analysis revealed that the antiSMASH database contained an incomplete berninamycin A BGC as a reference (MIBiG accession BGC0001472), lacking the gene berH from the berninamycin A BGC (berA-J) as initially described by Malcolmson et\\xa0al.\\xa0(42).This was found after BLAST analysis of each individual gene of BGC 6_3 from Tü 2108 and comparisons with the respective BGC genes from S. bernensis (Table 2). Thus, all genes essential for berninamycin biosynthesis are present in Tü 2108.

Bioinformatic analyses disclose that the berninamycin BGC is surrounded by potential self-resistance genes Berninamycin belongs to the class of pyridine-containing thiopeptides and targets the 50S ribosomal subunit in a similar manner as described for thiostrepton (42). Several berninamycin producer strains are known, whereby the production of berninamycin derivatives differs in the various producer strains (Supplemental material Figure S3). A comparison between the known berninamycin BGC from S. bernensis and the BGC from Tü 2108 revealed that the predicted gene products show high amino acid sequence homologies (90–100%) amongst each other (Table 2). To identify potential self-resistance genes for strain Tü 2108, the genome sequence was analyzed with the bioinformatics software tool ARTS v. 2.0. As mentioned above, ARTS detects potential self-resistance genes based on the following individual three criteria: (i) duplicated core genes, (ii) core genes localized within a BGC\\xa0and (iii) core genes with incongruent phylogeny (16). For Tü 2108, the suggested self-resistance genes were sorted with regard to genes associated with protein synthesis as a metabolic function. Concerning protein synthesis associated genes, ARTS employs a reference set of 100 core genes related to protein synthesis (16). For Tü 2108 it was found that 15 protein synthesis-associated genes met the above mentioned criteria for resistance patterns: In total, nine duplicated core genes, 13 core genes located in a BGC, and six phylogenetically distinct core genes were predicted (Table 3). The majority of the detected core genes present in a BGC, mapped to the berninamycin cluster BGC 6_3 (Table 2). Here, the core genes are organized at the left and right borders of the berninamycin BGC 6_3 (Figure 3) and code for potential ribosomal proteins (L4, S12, S10, uS7), as well as elongation factors G and TU (Table 2). For instance, ORF 01243 encoding the putative elongation factor TU (EF-TU) was duplicated and phylogenetically distinct from another putative EF-TU encoding gene (TIGR00485) present in the Tü 2108 genome. A similar genetic organization was found for the berninamycin A BGC (berA-J) in S. bernensis (Figure 3). Notably, also a berJ homologous gene is present within BGC 6_3 of Tü 2108, which codes for a potential 23S rRNA methyltransferase, an enzyme well-known for conferring resistance to ribosome-targeting drugs (43). However, this gene, which most likely represents the actual berninamycin self-resistance gene, was not detected with ARTS, which is due to the fact that it was not included in the list of core genes. The predominant occurrence of these protein synthesis-associated core genes in the proximity of the berninamycin BGC indicates a potential linkage to self-resistance mechanisms. This finding supports the hypothesis that resistance genes can provide an indication of the mode of action of a BGC-encoded secondary metabolite. Protein synthesis core genes of Tü 2108 identified with ARTS. Following criteria are listed: gene duplication, phylogenetic gene difference, occurrence of core genes in a biosynthetic gene cluster (BCG). +: criterion fulfilled, –: criterion not fulfilled.

Development of a genome sequenced-based screening approach for the identification of PSI producer strains Based on the knowledge gained above, an in silico screening approach was developed, capitalizing on the occurrence of protein synthesis associated self-resistance genes to evaluate the genetic potential of bacterial strains to produce a PSI. To validate the approach, genome sequences of 47 known PSI producers were analyzed with ARTS. Here, it was found that several known PSI producers showed high numbers (>20) of protein synthesis core genes, fulfilling at least one of the three criteria mentioned for the prediction of self-resistance genes, defined as ‘hit genes’. For example, the anisomycin producer Streptomyces roseochromogenus displayed 42 hit genes and the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea 51 hit genes (Table 4). The majority of the identified hit genes of the PSI producers were characterized as phylogenetic incongruencies (76%) and only a minor part represented core gene duplications (46%) or gene localization within a BGC (26%) (Supplementary Table S3). Among the hit genes, seven core genes appeared regularly, which were rpsE, rpsL, rplC, rplD, rplK, rplQ\\xa0and rplV encoding for the putative ribosomal proteins S5, S12, L3, L4, L11, L17\\xa0and L22, respectively (Table 4). For all these genes, it was shown in previous work that they play an essential role in conferring resistance against PSIs. For example, mutations in rpsE, rpsL, and rplC resulted in altered S5, S12\\xa0and L3 proteins that conferred resistance against spectinomycin, streptomycin, and linezolid/tiamulin, respectively, in E. coli (44–46). Mutations in rplD and rplV were shown to result in altered L4 and L22 proteins, respectively, conferring resistance to erythromycin in E. coli (47,48). Mutations in rplK resulted in an altered L11 protein conferring resistance to thiostrepton in Thermus thermophilus (49) and mutations in rplQ resulted in an altered L17 protein conferring resistance to erythromycin in B. subtilis (50). According to these observations, the seven ribosomal genes were regarded as PSI 'resistance indicator genes’ (RI genes). The RI genes were found to be mainly present in PSI producer strains with a high number of PSI hit genes, e.g. S. roseochromogenus and S. erythraea with six and five RI genes, respectively (Table 4). However, some of the RI genes were also found in PSI producers with a lower number of hit genes, such as Streptomyces pristinaespiralis PR11 and Streptomyces pactum, with only one RI gene each. Furthermore, there were also examples of known PSI producers that showed neither a high abundance of hit genes nor any RI gene (Table 4). To examine whether the accumulation of hit and RI genes is a specific phenomenon for PSI producers, we additionally analyzed numerous genome sequences of antibiotic producers, which are known not to produce PSIs as a comparison. Thereby, it was found that the non-PSI producers had generally low numbers of protein synthesis-related hit genes (<20) and none of the strains contained any of the seven RI genes (Table 5). Thus, we concluded that if a bacterial strain has (i) a large number of PSI hit genes (>20) and in addition (ii) two or more RI gene(s) it is likely to be a PSI producer strain.

Based on these findings, we devised a genome sequence-based in silico screening strategy for the identification of potential PSI producers, which was designated as protein synthesis inhibitor (‘psi’) target gene footprinting = Ψ-footprinting approach. The strategy involves the process of screening bacterial genome sequences with ARTS for the presence of a high number (≥20) of PSI hit genes and the abundance of RI genes (at least two), which allows for the identification of potential PSI producer strains. For dereplication purposes, the genome sequence of the identified strain is additionally analyzed with antiSMASH to sort out strains, which harbor BGCs encoding already known PSIs, allowing for the prioritization of strains likely to produce novel PSIs (Figure 4). Figure 4.Graphic illustration of the genome sequenced-based screening approach for the identification of PSI producer strains, designated Ψ-footprinting. Graphic illustration of the genome sequenced-based screening approach for the identification of PSI producer strains, designated Ψ-footprinting. Verification of the Ψ-footprinting method by analyzing PSI producer strains of the Tübingen strain collection To apply the Ψ-footprinting method to the previously discovered PSI producers of the Tübingen strain collection (5), the genomic DNA of the strains Tü 2108, Tü 2975, Tü 3180, Tü 6430, KNN 49.3e\\xa0and A 4/2 was sequenced and analyzed as described above. A 4/2 was not further evaluated as it produced the eukaryotic PSI cycloheximide. Among the five strains, three (KNN 49.3e, Tü 3180\\xa0and Tü 6430) showed large numbers of hit genes, with abundances of 88, 50\\xa0and 45, respectively (Table 6). All strains harbored at least one RI gene, whereby for KNN 49.3e all seven RI genes were detected (Table 6). This showcase demonstrates that the Ψ-footprinting method enabled a genome sequence-based identification of three out of five PSI producer strains from the Tübingen strain collection.

Ψ-footprinting method allows to prioritize potential PSI producers from the DSMZ strain collection To apply the Ψ-footprinting approach to so far uncharacterized strains, the method was challenged with numerous genome-sequenced strains from the DSMZ strain collection. Here, the focus was on the analysis of genome sequences from rare actinomycetes in order to increase the probability of finding new substances. 406 actinomycetal genome sequences were examined. 118 genomes (30%) showed a high number of PSI hit genes (>20) (data not shown) and 141 (35%) strains had at least one RI gene (Supplementary Table S4). 110 (27%) of the strains met the two criteria for possible PSI production (≥20 PSI hit genes and at least two RI genes) and thus were candidate strains for PSI production. Genome sequences, which met these criteria, were analyzed with antiSMASH to exclude strains containing an already known PSI BGC. In total, 15 strains were prioritized for further analysis, which harbored up to 71 hit genes and five RI genes, as for example strain Jiangella alkaliphila DSM 45079 (Table 7).

To investigate whether the selected 15 strains produce PSIs, the strains were cultivated in three different cultivation media (NL800, MS\\xa0and R5) shown to be suitable production media in previous studies (5). Culture samples were harvested at different time points (4, 7\\xa0and 10 days), extracted with ethyl acetate in a ratio of 1:1, concentrated 20-fold in vacuo and then redissolved in methanol. To investigate if the extracts contained substances with protein synthesis inhibiting activity, samples were analyzed using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation (ivTT) assay (31). This cell-free assay uses the E. coli translational machinery to express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a plasmid (pET28a-eGFP), reporting transcription/translation activity by fluorescence emission analysis. First, the assay was validated for the analysis of culture extracts and it was found to tolerate 30 μl of the concentrated culture extracts in a total assay volume of 100 μl without significant interference. Changes in GFP expression were monitored by measuring the fluorescence at 485/520 nm excitation/emission with a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro device and analyzing the data with the i-control™ Microplate Reader Software 1.11. To determine the maximum fluorescence value (GFP fluorescence\\xa0=\\xa0100%), the assay was performed without the addition of antibiotics. As positive controls for effective protein synthesis inhibition, pure tetracycline and apramycin were used, respectively. As negative control, media extracts of the respective culture media (NL800, MS\\xa0and R5) were tested to exclude that the observed inhibitory effects were caused by media components. Furthermore, extract samples from the strain S. coelicolor M1146 (M1146) were analyzed as a negative control. M1146 is a genetically engineered strain with deleted BGCs and thus lacking any antibiotic production (51). M1146 extracts were analyzed to exclude that the observed inhibitory effects were caused by components from the cell metabolism of actinomycetes. IvTT conducted with the media extract samples as negative controls yielded 70% - 85% maximal GFP fluorescence values and thus had only a minor inhibiting effect on the assay (Figure 5). The same was observed for the culture extracts of M1146, for which the fluorescence values varied between 70% and 90% (Figure 5). The addition of 5 μl tetracycline (15 mg/ml) (tet15) and 5 μl of apramycin (50 mg/ml) (apra50) resulted in very low GFP fluorescence values of 13% and 12%, respectively, indicating a strong inhibition of the ivTT assay (Figure 5). Based on these control measurements, an internal threshold was set, according to which fluorescence values between 0% and 40% were considered to represent specific inhibition of the ivTT assay and values of 0–20% indicate strong inhibition of the assay.

IvTT assays with extract samples of strains DSM 44555, DSM 44498\\xa0and DSM 44908 showed no significant inhibition of GFP expression and thus the samples obviously did not contain protein synthesis inhibiting substances or at least they were not produced by the strains under the applied cultivation conditions (Supplementary Figure S4). IvTT assays with extract samples from the other twelve strains (DSM 44944, DSM 45888, DSM 45258, DSM 43821, DSM 44073, DSM 45079, DSM 45657, DSM 43813, DSM 43919, DSM 45408, DSM 25218\\xa0and DSM 44771) yielded significantly low fluorescence values ranging from 6% - 40% relative fluorescence (Supplementary Figure S5) and thus specific inhibition of the assay. This was observed for samples obtained from all tested media, whereby data are shown for the respective best production medium (Figure 6), while the complete dataset can be found in the supplemental material (Supplementary Figure S5). ivTT assays were additionally carried out with eleven culture extract sample from random strains of the Tübingen strain collection, of which none led to a specific inhibition (<40% fluorescence) of the assay, demonstrating that none of the strains produced a substance with PSI activity (Supplementary Figure S6).

IvTT assays with culture extracts of DSM 43813, DSM 45079, DSM 45408, DSM 25218\\xa0and DSM 44771 grown in R5 resulted in the lowest fluorescence values (<20% maximal fluorescence), which indicated strong inhibition of the GFP expression, representatively shown for sample DSM 43813 (Figure 6, Supplementary Figure S5). Samples of strains DSM 43813 and DSM 45079 from sampling time points at days 7 and 10, respectively, reduced fluorescence to values of 17% and 12%, respectively (Figure 6). Samples of strains DSM 45408, DSM 25218\\xa0and DSM 44771 showed the strongest inhibiting effect for sampling time points at days 4, 7 and 10 with residual fluorescence values of 3%, 6% and 7%, respectively (Figure 6, Supplementary Figure S5). Since culture extracts of these five strains specifically inhibited the ivTT assay, it could be concluded that they interfere with protein expression and may contain a PSI. Thus, using the Ψ-footprinting-based prioritization of actinomycetes strains, potential PSI production was detected by ivTT assays for twelve out of the 15 (80%) selected DSM strains. Identification of PSI substances from Ψ-footprinting-prioritized strains of the DSMZ strain collection In order to identify the PSIs produced by the selected and analyzed DSM strains, the culture extracts were purified by semi-preparative HPLC followed by HPLC-MS analysis of the pre-purified substances. For these analyses, we focused on samples that showed the strongest inhibition of the ivTT assays, which included DSM 43813, DSM 45079, DSM 45408, DSM 25218\\xa0and DSM 44771. Methanolic culture extracts were prepared from samples harvested at the optimal production time point as reported above and protein synthesis inhibiting activity was verified in ivTT assays. For compound purification, semi-preparative HPLC was performed with the culture extracts. The fractions were collected in time-based mode every minute for 25 min and were analyzed for PSI activity via ivTT. Assay analysis revealed that individual purified fractions from all five DSM strain samples (DSM 43813, DSM 45079, DSM 45408, DSM 25218\\xa0and DSM 44771) showed significant inhibition of the ivTT assay (Figure 7, Supplementary Figures S7-S10). Interestingly, for all five extracts, fraction 8 (F8) showed the strongest inhibition, with fluorescence values of 9%, 30%, 4%, 33%\\xa0and 7%, respectively (Figure 7, Supplementary Figures S7-S10), which suggested that F8 contained a protein synthesis inhibiting substance. HPLC-MS analysis of all extract samples and F8 fractions was performed to identify the respective PSI. The HPLC chromatograms of the extract samples of F8 of DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218, and DSM 44771 of F8 showed a prominent peak at a retention time (RT) 7.2 min, as representatively shown for the sample DSM 25218 (Figure 8A). HPLC-MS analysis of the F8 samples of DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218\\xa0and DSM 44771 revealed one distinct peak in positive and negative mode at RT 7.2 min (Figure 8B and\\xa0C). This peak showed a characteristic UV–Vis spectrum with three λmax at 206 , 248 and 314 nm, respectively (Figure 8D). The peak was detected in positive mode at m/z\\xa0=\\xa0424.2 [M\\xa0+\\xa0H]+ and in negative mode at m/z\\xa0=\\xa0422.1 [M–H]– (Figure 8B and\\xa0C). The mass of m/z\\xa0=\\xa0423 is consistent with the mass of amicoumacin A (molecular weight 423.5; molecular formula C20H29N3O7) (52). The peak at RT 7.4 shows a prominent shoulder (Figure 8A). This often results due to the presence of two similar substances, which were not separated chromatographically. The shoulder showed a UV–Vis spectrum similar to that of amicoumacin A (Fig. 8G versus D). The UV–Vis spectrum of the peak was compared with an internal database, matching the entry of amicoumacin B (Figure 8G). This peak was detected in positive mode at m/z\\xa0=\\xa0425.1 [M\\xa0+\\xa0H]+ and in negative mode at m/z\\xa0=\\xa0423.1 [M–H]– (Figure 8E and\\xa0F). The mass of m/z\\xa0=\\xa0424 is consistent with the mass of amicoumacin B (molecular weight 424.4; molecular formula C20H28N2O8) (52). Amicoumacin A and B production have further been confirmed by high-resolution MS/MS (HRMS) analysis with F8 sample of DSM 45408, representatively (Supplementary Figure S11). The data obtained in this study (UV–Vis spectrum in combination with RT and mass of the peaks) showed that F8 of the samples DSM 43813, DSM 45408, DSM 25218\\xa0and DSM 44771 contained the PSIs amicoumacin A and B. Regarding F8 of strain DSM 45079, the mass of amicoumacin was not detected in this sample, and no mass or UV–Vis spectra of known PSIs could be assigned. It cannot be ruled out that amicoumacin was present in this sample in a very low concentration, which would fit to the lower inhibitory effect in the ivTT assay. On the other hand, this result could also indicate that the strain produces a novel PSI, but further cultivation and purification steps are necessary to allow accurate conclusions.

The background was subtracted due to the overexposed masses of amicoumacin A for B/C and E/F (from main peak). Amicoumacins are known PSIs, belonging to a class of isocoumarin antibiotics with antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities (53). They also show potent antibacterial activities against clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (54,55). Amicoumacin affects bacterial growth by binding to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, specifically at the E-site codon of the mRNA, and thereby inhibits the translation process. This position is a rather unusual target site and implies a unique way of translation inhibition for amicoumacin (56). Amicoumacin has been reported as a natural product from different microbial producers, involving Gram-positive bacteria, such as certain representatives of Bacillus and Nocardia (54,57,58) but also the Gram-negative producer Xenorhabdus bovienii (53). In addition, our data revealed that amicoumacin is produced by various types of actinomycetes, namely Saccharopolyspora flava DSM 44771, Micromonospora aurantiaca DSM 43813, Nocardioides albertanoniae DSM 25218, and Geodermatophilus nigrescens DSM 45408, which belong to different orders of the phylum Actinobacteria, such as Pseudonocardiales, Micromonosporales, Propionobacteriales, and Geodermatophilales, respectively (Supplementary Figure S12). Thus, the ability to produce amicoumacin seems to be quite conserved across different groups of bacterial organisms, hinting at a so far unknown general biological function. The reason why we have not been able to dereplicate the substance based on BGC predictions is that the respective amicoumacin BGCs could not be identified by antiSMASH analysis. The amicoumacin BGC was described as nonribosomal peptide-polyketide hybrid BGC for the producer strain Xenorhabdus bovieni (53). However, the BGC is not part of the MIBiG repository and thus is not accessible as a reference in the antiSMASH database, which is why the BGCs were not identified by antiSMASH analysis for the amicoumacin producers of the DSMZ strain collection. Remarkably, also detailed manual sequence analyses did not lead to the identification of the amicoumacin BGCs. We therefore assume that the actinobacterial amicoumacin biosynthesis (high GC content bacteria) proceeds differently and is encoded by a strikingly different type of BGC than in the known producers of Xenorhabdus and Bacillus (low GC content bacteria). If so, this would speak for a convergent evolution of the amicoumacin BGCs in the phylogenetically distantly related producer strains. The fact that we have detected amicoumacin as PSI in our samples underscores the feasibility and reliability of the Ψ-footprinting strategy. The advantage of this method is that it is purely in silico-based. Conventional antibiotic screening approaches are generally much more labor-intensive since they involve screening a large number of strains, followed by extensive compound purifications and chemical analytics with the risk that the identified bioactive substance is already known. The Ψ-footprinting strategy is a fast and efficient method to specifically prioritize potential producers of PSIs based on genome-sequence information and thereby speeds up the lead discovery process. Until now, it was not possible to transfer this method to antibiotics with a different mode of action. The derived in silico strategy is so far only applicable for the prioritization of potential PSI producer strains, due to the number of core genes used as a reference set in the ARTS analysis. For the metabolic function of protein synthesis ∼100 core genes are defined in the reference set, which are significantly lower core gene numbers for other metabolic functions, such as DNA metabolism- or cell envelope-associated functions (16). Certainly, not all PSI producers can be detected with the Ψ-footprinting approach, as for example shown for Streptomyces griseus, a known producer of the PSI streptomycin (Table 4). Another limitation of the approach might be that it employs known RI genes as indicator genes, which could prevent the discovery of really novel PSIs with different MoAs. In this context, however, it would be possible to adopt a less stringent Ψ-footprinting run and exclude RI genes as a selection criterion, which would allow for a more explorative screening attempt. However, following the defined criteria for Ψ-footprinting, which are (i) a high number (≥20) of PSI hit genes and (ii) the additional abundance of RI genes, allows a reliable pre-selection of potential PSI producers. This was proven by the identification of twelve PSI producer strains from the 15 Ψ-selected strains in the current study, which inhibited protein synthesis in ivTT assays. In addition, the responsible PSI substances (amicoumacin A and B) were identified for four of these strains. Prioritized strains for which protein synthesis inhibiting activities were observed but no PSI identified yet are subject to ongoing work.\",\n",
       " '2.1. Sphinganine-Analog Producing Fungal Species Are More Resistant to Fumonisin B1 Than Non-Producers To investigate whether the production of fumonisins or the related AAL toxin is associated with increased toxin resistance, we compared the growth of various fungal strains (see Table 1) in the presence of FB1. First, we compared the growth of a well-studied F. verticillioides strain (FGSC 7600), which had been previously utilized for elucidation of the FUM cluster and for determination of the first genome sequence [32], with the growth of the likewise relevant fumonisin-nonproducer F. graminearum (strain PH-1, [33]) at different temperatures and different levels of fumonisins added to minimal medium. Since very high concentrations were needed for full inhibition, a crude concentrated extract containing fumonisins B1, B2, and B3 was used as previously described [34], which contained 3.18 g/L FB1. Without added toxin at 20 °C, F. graminearum (red pigmented, on the right half of the plates shown in Figure 1) grew more vigorously and covered a larger portion of the medium than F. verticillioides. At 30 °C, F. verticillioides grew better, and after two weeks, both strains covered about half of the plate. When increasing amounts of fumonisin were added to the medium, F. graminearum was increasingly inhibited, while F. verticillioides continued to grow. At the highest concentration tested (176 µM FB1), growth of F. graminearum was completely inhibited, while F. verticillioides showed only marginally reduced radial growth after 7 days at 30 °C (Figure 1). We conclude that the fumonisin-producing F. verticillioides has clearly higher resistance to fumonisin than F. graminearum. Next, we compared various Alternaria strains (Figure 2A) producing or not producing sphinganine-analog toxins. The A. alternata f.sp. lycopersici strain AS27-12 is a well-known producer of AAL toxin and related derivatives [35]. Its resistance level was compared to two A. alternata isolates from our local university collection (Austrian Center for Biological Resources (https://acbr-database.boku.ac.at/, accessed on 21 May 2024)). The strain MA 304 was originally isolated from apple in the USA, whereas MA 308 caused leaf spot in Solanum tuberosum. Both strains do not produce AAL toxin. Already, at the low concentration of 10 µM (about 7.2 mg/L), the growth of both nonproducing strains was strongly reduced to about 20% of the diameter, while the AAL-producing strain had 78% of its diameter on the no-toxin control. At 50 µM FB1, the AAL strain had an about 50% reduced diameter, while the two nonproducer strains were almost completely inhibited. We also tested (Figure 2B) whether an Aspergillus niger wild-type strain, for which fumonisin production had been demonstrated (ATCC 11414, [36], see Table S1 therein), is more resistant than a wild-type A. nidulans strain (FGSC A4, [37]). F. verticillioides was added on top of the plates as a control (Figure 2B). At 10 µM FB1, the A. nidulans strains were already fully inhibited, while A. niger was only slightly inhibited (compared to no toxin 86% diameter at 10 µM and 66% at 50 µM). Seemingly, a mechanism of protection exists in sphinganine-analog toxin producers. We set out to test whether target insensitivity is involved. 2.2. Generation and Characterization of a fum17-18 Deletion Strain in a fum1 Background To be able to study the effects of added toxin undisturbed by endogenously synthesized fumonisin, we generated a fum17-fum18 double mutant in the background of a fum1::hygB mutant. The previously described fum1 mutant strain GfA2364, which is derived from the wild-type strain FGSC 7600 [20,38] by insertion of the hygB resistance gene into the FUM1 PKS, was transformed with a construct that allows for simultaneous deletion of both genes using a nptII (G418) resistance cassette (see Section 4). Two transformants, designated KTFD1 and KTFD4, were obtained and used in the fumonisin resistance tests: their growth was compared to the growth of the parental fum1 mutant strain GfA2364. As evident from Figure 3—even on the highest concentration tested—both, the wild-type and the knockout strains were still able to grow. For unknown reasons, stronger and earlier pigmentation occurred in the wild type. We conclude that the cluster-encoded ceramide synthase genes FUM17 and FUM18 are not necessary for high-level resistance to fumonisin B1. 2.3. Testing Fumonisin Resistance of Ceramide Synthase Genes by Heterologous Expression in Yeast The finding that the FUM17 and FUM18 genes are not necessary for self-resistance against FB1 indicates possible redundancy. F. verticillioides has three additional predicted ceramide synthase genes, CER1, CER2, and CER3 [31], encoded outside the FUM cluster. We have recently reported the construction of a fumonisin-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain [34]. We transformed this strain with the plasmids described by Janevska et al. [31] for the expression of the F. verticillioides ceramide synthase cDNAs behind the constitutive TEF1 promoter. As controls, the yeast ceramide synthases LAG1 (“longevity assurance gene”, [39]) and its paralog (“longevity assurance cognate”) LAC1 [40] were also overexpressed. Yeast transformants were spotted onto SC-URA plates supplemented with increasing amounts of FB1. Overexpression of LAC1, but not of LAG1, conferred low-level resistance at concentrations that were inhibitory for the empty vector controls. At higher concentrations, the yeast genes did not confer resistance, in contrast to F. verticillioides FUM18, CER1, CER2, and CER3. As shown in Figure 4, the yeast host (containing functional endogenous LAG1 and LAC1 genes) transformed with the empty vector was already sensitive to 2.5 µM FB1. Overexpression of LAC1 but not LAG1 in the 2 µ multicopy plasmid behind the strong TEF1 promoter conferred a low level of increased resistance. On the other hand, high-level resistance (highest concentration tested 150 µM) was conferred by the expression of FUM18 but not FUM17, and equally well by all three F. verticillioides ceramide synthases, CER1, CER2, and CER3.',\n",
       " 'The T6SS gene cluster harbours self-resistance determinants and candidate secreted effectors The T6SS gene cluster of S. marcescens Db10, SMA2244–2281, contains 38 genes, including many with no known function (Murdoch et al., 2011). We speculated that encoded within this cluster might be T6-secreted effectors and/or self-resistance determinants, the latter preventing the T6SS-expressing cell from harming itself or being harmed by its isogenic (sibling) neighbours. In order to determine whether the cluster did indeed contain self-resistance determinants (such as specific immunity proteins analogous to the Tsi proteins), we generated a mutant lacking the entire T6SS gene cluster (ΔT6SS) and examined whether it was fully resistant to the T6SS of the wild type strain. Co-culture of two target strains, wild type Db10 and the ΔT6SS mutant, each with a wild type and a ΔclpV attacker, showed that the ΔT6SS mutant had lost resistance to T6SS-mediated inhibition or killing by the wild type strain (Fig. 1A, left). Recovery of ΔT6SS was decreased 100-fold when it was co-cultured with the wild type strain, compared with when the wild type strain was co-cultured with itself. This effect was dependent on a functional T6SS in the attacker as there was no loss of ΔT6SS when it was co-cultured with a ΔclpV mutant. The ATPase ClpV is one of the core, structural components of the T6SS and we have shown previously that it is essential for Hcp secretion and T6-mediated antibacterial killing activity of S. marcescens Db10 (Murdoch et al., 2011). To simplify the analysis of multiple mutants, we defined the ‘resistance index’ of a strain as the difference between recovery when co-cultured with the wild type strain and recovery when co-cultured with the ΔclpV mutant, specifically log2[recovery vs. wild type/recovery vs. ΔclpV]. The wild type or other resistant strain will show no difference and have a resistance index of 0. A target strain with reduced ability to resist harm caused by the T6SS will have a negative resistance index, exemplified by the ΔT6SS mutant with a resistance index of −7.6 (Fig. 1A, right). Self-resistance did not depend on an active T6SS, as a ΔclpV mutant had a resistance index of 0. Similarly, mutants in other essential core T6SS components, Δlip, ΔicmH and ΔtssK (Murdoch et al., 2011) also showed no loss of self-resistance (data not shown). Therefore, genes other than those encoding the core conserved T6SS components were implicated in self-resistance. Our attention was particularly caught by a locus in the middle of the gene cluster, where six non-conserved genes, SMA2260–2262, SMA2264–2266, are flanked by conserved T6SS components. A mutant lacking all of these genes (but maintaining intact SMA2263, encoding Hcp1) was also tested and found to have a negative resistance index (Fig. 1A). Hence, one or more of these genes contributes to self-resistance and may encode immunity protein(s).

Δrap1ab,ssp1 indicates a mutant lacking the rap1a, rap1b and ssp1 genes; Δrap2ab,ssp2 indicates a mutant lacking the rap2a, rap2b and ssp2 genes; Δssp1,ssp2 indicates a mutant lacking the ssp1 and ssp2 genes, and Δrap,ssp indicates a mutant lacking all of the rap and ssp genes. Closer examination of the proteins encoded by SMA2260–2262 and SMA2264–2266 revealed two classes of small proteins (Fig. 1B). SMA2261 and SMA2264 were basic proteins with detectable sequence similarity between them, no discernable cellular localization signals and no predicted function. We hypothesized that they might be secreted substrates, and, given subsequent results, named them Ssp1 and Ssp2 (Secreted small protein). SMA2260, SMA2262, SMA2265 and SMA2266 were proteins with classical Sec-dependent N-terminal signal peptides, identified using SignalP (Petersen et al., 2011), and thus predicted to be periplasmic. They also had no predicted function but shared detectable sequence similarity with each other. We hypothesized that they would represent specific immunity proteins or other self-resistance determinants, and named them Rap1a, Rap1b, Rap2a and Rap2b (Resistance associated protein). The genes encoding all these small proteins fall into two sets, either side of hcp1 and within genes encoding T6SS structural proteins, vipB and fha (Fig. 1B). Homologues of the Ssp and Rap proteins are encoded within T6SS gene clusters in many other bacterial species (and in at least one case apart from the T6SS) and appear to always co-occur (see representative examples in Fig. 1C). We speculated that the S. marcescens Ssp and Rap proteins represented previously unknown combinations of T6-secreted effectors and cognate immunity proteins. Importantly, mutants lacking one, some or all of the small proteins exhibited wild type levels of Hcp secretion (Figs 1D and S1). Thus, none of the Ssp or Rap proteins is required for Hcp secretion, i.e. they play no structural role in the T6SS. Ssp1 and Ssp2 are Type VI-secreted effectors Ssp1 and Ssp2 were shown to be secreted substrates of the T6SS by immunoblotting secreted fractions from the wild type strain, two T6SS mutants, ΔclpV and ΔtssE, and the corresponding complemented strains, using specific anti-Ssp1 and anti-Ssp2 antibodies. Both proteins were detected in the culture supernatant, entirely dependent on a functional T6SS (Fig. 2A). Neither protein was detectable in the cellular fraction, implying they were rapidly turned over if not secreted (data not shown). Secretion of Ssp2 was also independent of Ssp1, and vice versa, again confirming they have no structural or accessory role in the secretion machinery (Fig. 2A). In order to establish if the Ssp proteins were antibacterial toxins contributing to the killing or inhibition of the susceptible ΔT6SS mutant by the wild type strain, the recovery of ΔT6SS in the presence of different mutants was determined. Recovery of the ΔT6SS target was increased fivefold with the Δssp2 mutant, or any multiple mutant lacking ssp2, as attacker, compared with the wild type attacker (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in this assay, loss of Ssp1 did not cause a statistically significant impairment in killing of ΔT6SS. None of the Rap proteins was required for targeting of ΔT6SS (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2Proteins Ssp1 and Ssp2 are secreted by the Type VI secretion system and self-harm is mediated by Ssp2.A.

Bars show mean ± SEM (n ≥ 4); *** indicates a significant difference compared with the wild type strain (P < 0.001). Self-resistance against the Ssp1 and Ssp2 toxins is mediated by their cognate Rap partners In order to assess the contribution of each of the rap (and ssp) genes to self-resistance, single mutants were constructed. It rapidly became apparent that single mutants in rap1a and rap2a had severe fitness defects on solid media, both on rich (Fig. 3A) and minimal media (Fig. S2), and particularly Δrap2a. Culture spots and single colonies of each mutant were ‘thinner’, smaller (in the case of Δrap2a), and with altered surface morphology. Examination of single cells showed that the Δrap1a cells appeared bigger and less uniformly shaped than wild type cells and the Δrap2a cells had striking phenotypes, being either markedly distended or highly elongated (Figs 3A and S2). These phenotypes could be complemented by expression of the corresponding gene in trans (indeed, the additional stress of the selective antibiotic made the phenotypes of Δrap1a and Δrap2a mutants carrying vector control plasmids even more pronounced; Fig. 3A). In contrast, when Δrap1a was constructed in combination with Δssp1, or Δrap2a in combination with Δssp2, the double mutants were readily made and were of normal appearance and fitness on solid media (Figs 3A and S2). These observations are entirely consistent with Rap2a serving as the immunity protein against the Ssp2 toxin and Rap1a being the cognate immunity protein alleviating toxicity mediated by Ssp1. Similarly, when Δrap1a or Δrap2a mutants were constructed in combination with the ΔclpV mutation, the double mutants were again apparently healthy on solid media (Figs 3A and S2). Hence, self-toxicity depended on a functional T6SS, implying it was caused by T6SS-mediated injection of the toxin into a susceptible cell by its neighbours (further supported by the observation that Δrap1a and Δrap2a did not display comparable growth defects in liquid culture, where contact-dependent targeting is unlikely to occur efficiently; Fig. S2).

In (B) and (C), bars show mean ± SEM (n ≥ 4); *** indicates a significant difference compared with the wild type strain (P < 0.001). An immunity function for Rap2a was directly demonstrated in co-culture (antibacterial competition assay): target strains containing a Δrap2a mutation all showed a negative resistance index (Fig. 3B; the single Δrap2a mutant was not tested because of its severe sickness). Strains containing a Δrap1a mutation did not have a negative resistance index, consistent with the lack of significant contribution of Ssp1 to self-killing under the conditions of these assays (Fig. 2B). To confirm that Ssp2 was directly and entirely responsible for the inhibitory effect of a wild type attacker strain on Δrap2a, we showed that a Δrap2a target strain is completely resistant to attack by a Δssp2 mutant, with recovery of Δrap2a in the presence of a Δssp2 attacker being the same as its recovery in the presence of a ΔclpV attacker (Fig. 3C). Additionally, inhibition of Δrap2a target was restored to wild type levels when the Δssp2 mutant attacker was complemented by expression of Ssp2 in trans. The susceptibility of Δrap2a to killing by the wild type strain could also be fully complemented (Fig. S2). Hence, Ssp2 and Rap2a represent a specific, cognate toxin and immunity protein pair. Biochemical studies confirm a strong interaction between cognate secreted toxins and immunity proteins Each of the Ssp and Rap proteins was overproduced and purified (in the case of the Rap proteins, without their N-terminal signal peptides). Complex formation was demonstrated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis. All Rap proteins were dimeric in solution, whereas Ssp1 and Ssp2 were monomeric (Fig. 4A and B). When equimolar amounts of Ssp1 and Rap1a were mixed, all of the protein was detected in a higher molecular weight complex (Fig. 4A) and the same was also observed on mixing Ssp2 and Rap2a (Fig. 4A). In contrast, no complex formation between Ssp1 and Rap1b or between Ssp2 and Rap2b, no additional three-way complexes and no ‘cross’ interactions between Ssp2 and Rap1a or between Ssp1 and Rap2a were observed (Figs 4B and S3). As mixing equimolar amounts of Ssp1 and Rap1a resulted in detection of only the complexed species, with no unbound form of either protein detectable, this implied a 1:1 molar complex. The 1:1 molar stoichiometry of the Rap1a–Ssp1 complex was confirmed by quantitative analysis of the composition of the higher molecular weight peak using in-gel SYPRO Orange staining (Rickman et al., 2004) (Fig. 4C). Given the dimeric nature of Rap1a and an apparent complex mass by SEC of around 55 kDa [predicted Mw of 1:1 molar complexes are 34.6 kDa (1:1), 69.2 kDa (2:2), 104 kDa (3:3) or 138 kDa (4:4)], this is most consistent with a heterotetrameric Rap1a2–Ssp12 complex. Similar logic supported a Rap2a2–Ssp22 complex (Fig. 4A and C). The SEC analyses suggested stable complexes were formed between the cognate Ssp and Rap proteins. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis of complex formation between Ssp1 and the Rap1a dimer and between Ssp2 and the Rap2a dimer (Fig. 4D) showed that, in both cases, binding was clearly exothermic and tight, at least in the low nanomolar Kd range. Although apparent Kd values of 4–8 nM were obtained, this is approaching the limit of accuracy for conventional ITC (Wiseman et al., 1989). Finally, we took advantage of the tight Rap–Ssp interactions to utilize immobilized Rap2a and Rap1a to affinity-purify secreted Ssp2 or Ssp1, respectively, from culture supernatant (Figs 4E and S3). Mass spectrometry not only confirmed the identity of Ssp1 and Ssp2 but also showed that Ssp2 is not processed on secretion, as almost complete sequence coverage revealed intact N- and C-termini (Fig. S3). For Ssp1, we observed an intact C-terminus but the sequence of the very N-terminus corresponds to several tryptic peptides too small to be detectable by standard mass spectrometry, so we were unable to definitively confirm lack of processing at this end (data not shown).

The secreted small proteins, Ssp1 and Ssp2, exert distinct harmful effects when targeted to the periplasm in Escherichia coli and are neutralized by coexpression of the cognate immunity protein In order to confirm the antibacterial toxin function of Ssp1 and Ssp2 and establish in which cellular compartment they exerted their effect, each protein was produced in E. coli, either in the cytoplasm or artificially targeted to the periplasm (by the N-terminal fusion of the Sec-dependent OmpA signal peptide: sp-Ssp2 or sp-Ssp1). The presence of Ssp2 in the periplasm, but not the cytoplasm, prevented growth of E. coli on LB and minimal media; this toxicity was alleviated by the co-production of Rap2ab (Fig. 5A). Periplasmic Ssp1 was also toxic and its effect alleviated by co-production of Rap1ab (Fig. 5A). However Ssp1 toxicity was only observed at higher expression levels and on minimal media. The periplasmic localization of the Rap proteins in S. marcescens was confirmed by fractionation and immunoblotting of epitope-tagged versions of the protein (Fig. 5B, data not shown).

Next, we also determined whether Ssp2 and/or Ssp1 were essential for the observed antibacterial activity of the S. marcescens T6SS against other bacterial species (Murdoch et al., 2011). Neither protein was required for T6SS-dependent killing of other bacteria (Fig. S4). This implies redundancy of effector function, in other words that other T6SS-secreted toxins are still able to cause killing in the absence of Ssp1 and Ssp2. The Rap family of proteins display a new fold Bioinformatic analysis of the Rap protein sequences predicted similarities between them, despite relatively low sequence conservation, e.g. mature Rap1b and Rap2b share around 20% identity, as do mature Rap2a and Rap2b. All four Rap proteins appeared to be highly acidic, to carry an N-terminal periplasmic targeting signal sequence of about 24 residues, and were predicted to have similar α-helical structures (using PSIPRED). In addition, a cysteine pairing appeared to be conserved. Intriguingly, no structural relative of the Rap proteins could be identified; hence, we sought to obtain three-dimensional models using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Soluble recombinant Rap proteins were only obtained in high yield from E. coli Rosetta-gami (DE3), a strain engineered to support disulphide bond formation, and were dimeric in solution (Fig. 4). Well-ordered crystals of Rap1b and Rap2b were obtained and the structures were elucidated at 1.9 Å and 2.0 Å resolution respectively (Fig. 6, Table 1). A search for structural relatives using PDBeFold (pdbe.org/fold) and ProFunc (Laskowski et al., 2005) was performed using monomers and dimers of Rap1b and Rap2b as templates. The only matches were to short segments of α-helices with Z-scores (< 3) indicating low statistical significance. The lack of any convincing structural relationships indicates that the fold observed in both Rap1b and Rap2b is previously uncharacterized. Fig. 6Structural features of Rap1b and Rap2b dimers.

The PDB accession codes are 4AX2 (Rap1b) and 4B6I (Rap2b). The asymmetric unit of the Rap1b structure consists of a single subunit and crystallographic symmetry generates the dimer. Rap2b has two dimers, formed by subunits A : B and C : D, in the asymmetric unit. The four subunits are similar, with the root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between superimposed Cα atoms ranging from 0.5 Å (subunit B and D) to 0.7 Å (subunits A and C). The two proteins display obvious similarities in terms of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (Figs 6 and S5). An overlay of Rap1b and Rap2b subunits matches 71 Cα atoms with a r.m.s.d. of 1.4 Å. Of note is the conservation of the disulphide bond, a key structural feature, likely critical to the stable folding of the subunit and subsequent dimerization of the Rap proteins. The Rap subunit is constructed around a helical bundle of five helices (α2–α6). A disulphide linkage (Cys54–Cys120 in Rap1b, Cys41–Cys101 in Rap2b) tethers α2 and α5 together. This association in turn supports formation of a hydrophobic core that is primarily aliphatic with residues contributed from α2, α4, α5 and α6. Three helices (α2, α3, α5) form a concave surface on one side of the monomer. A series of hydrogen bonding interactions also helps to stabilize the arrangement of α2 and α4. By virtue of being longer than Rap2b, Rap1b has an extension of five residues at the N-terminus and 13 at the C-terminus, the latter of which form a short helix α7. These segments of Rap1b are on the surface of the molecules at opposite ends of the dimer (Fig. 6). The Rap proteins display an extensive dimerization interface (Fig. 6), consistent with the observation that each Rap protein exists as a stable dimer in solution (Fig. 4A and B). The Rap1b dimer uses almost 24% of the accessible surface area of a subunit in formation of the dimer. In the case of Rap2b the value is 20%. Such percentages are indicative of highly stable oligomers (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). The dimer is stabilized by extensive van der Vaals interactions primarily involving aliphatic residues, in conjunction with hydrogen bonding interactions and solvent mediated bridging associations. The most important contributions are from side-chains on the concave surface, formed by α2, α3 and α5, interacting with the partner across the molecular twofold axis of symmetry. Additional interactions involve a self-association of the loop that links α2 and α3, together with the N-terminus α1 and α5. Helices α2 and α5 are thus not only critical for the fold of the Rap subunits but also to creating a suitable interface that leads to a highly stable dimer. This observation, together with the conserved disulphide bond (Fig. 7), ties in with the localization of Rap proteins to the oxidative environment of the periplasm where correct folding to support anti-toxin activity must occur.

Importantly, sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions for the other Rap proteins, in S. marcescens and other organisms, suggest strongly that the novel fold revealed by our crystallographic analyses is generic for this entire family of proteins (Fig. 7). Not only are the main α-helices observed in both crystal structures closely mimicked by the structural predictions of the other members of the family, the Cys residues contributing to the structural disulphide bond are also conserved. Additionally, Rap2b shares slightly higher sequence identity with Rap2a (23% identity for the mature proteins) than it does with Rap1b (20% identity). Given the similarity of the Rap1b and 2b crystal structures, discussed above (Fig. S5), then this provides confidence that Rap2a shares this new fold and indeed that the Rap fold is a defining characteristic of this protein family, many members of which are likely to represent T6SS immunity proteins.',\n",

While AlkZ is specific for AZB-ICLs and is essential to the AZB-producing organism, YcaQ unhooks a broader range of ICLs, including those derived from the simple bifunctional alkylating agent mechlorethamine (Fig.\\xa01B), and displays robust excision activity for N7-methylguanine (7mG) monoadducts (28, 30, 31). YcaQ and AlkZ belong to one of five classes of HTH_42 proteins characterized by domain organization, which accounts for >95% of all HTH_42 proteins (see Fig.\\xa0S1A in the supplemental material). Approximately two-thirds of the known HTH_42 proteins in prokaryotes are found in Actinobacteria, with ∼25% of those sequences from Streptomycetales (Fig.\\xa0S1B and C). The remainder are found in several different orders of Bacteria and a very small number (12) in Archaea. FIG\\xa01Phylogenetic organization of YQL/AZL proteins in Streptomyces.

AP-DNA resulting from glycosylase activity was treated with 0.2 M NaOH to generate β,δ-elimination products, which are quantified below the gel. Download FIG\\xa0S1, EPS file, 1.1 MB. To better understand the evolutionary and phylogenetic breadth of this superfamily in Streptomyces, we collected and analyzed all HTH_42 protein sequences from available genomes using a combination of BLAST searches against Streptomyces genomes in GenBank and HHMR protein domain searches of the BLAST hits against the Pfam database (Table\\xa0S1). Alignment of the 897 sequences showed that YQL and AZL proteins fall into distinct clades that represent 49% and 43% of the total number of sequences, respectively (Fig.\\xa01C). The clades are defined in part by unique catalytic motifs QΦD (YQL) and (Q/H)ΦQ (AZL), where Φ is an aliphatic residue (30, 31). YQL proteins show a high degree (>75%) of amino acid sequence conservation, whereas the AZL subfamily is more diverse, with only ∼40% amino acid similarity on average. The differences in conservation are consistent with mutation rates as approximated by tip-to-root branch lengths (0.23 for YQL and 0.59 for AZL). In addition, we found that 8% of sequences do not fall into either YQL or AZL clades and contain a unique catalytic consensus sequence, HΦ(S/T)(D/E) (Fig.\\xa01C and D). Because these sequences exhibit greater sequence similarity overall to AZL than YQL, we refer to this third homolog as AZL2. Interestingly, AZL2 is more similar to YQL in its copy number and genomic location (see below) and, thus, is somewhat of a hybrid between AZL and YQL. We verified that proteins within the AZL2 clade contain bona fide DNA glycosylase activity, as the S. caeruleatus AZL2 protein excised 7mG from DNA in a manner similar to that of S. sahachiroi AlkZ (Fig.\\xa0S1E). List of HTH_42 proteins by organism. List of all Streptomyces YQL (YcaQ-like), AZL (AlkZ-like), or AZL2 (AlkZ-like 2) proteins in this study, along with the GenBank/RefSeq genome/assembly ID for each organism. Homologs are alphabetized by organism. Download Table\\xa0S1, XLSX file, 0.04 MB. Another striking difference between the YQL and AZL families is that AZL genes are often found in multiple copies and in different combinations in many species of Streptomyces. The copy number differences between the different clades are significant, with the majority (90 to 95%) of YQL and AZL2 homologs found as a single copy and AZL mainly found in multiple (2–5) copies (Fig.\\xa01E). The coincidence of YQL and AZL also varies. Although the most common combination is the presence of a copy of each YQL and AZL, many other combinations are observed (Fig.\\xa01F). The number of species that contain both genes decreases as the copy number increases. For species containing either YQL or AZL (not both), the majority contain a single YQL copy, with just a few species having only AZL present. These results show that both YQL and AZL proteins are broadly distributed across Streptomyces and are distinct with respect to sequence, diversity, and copy number. AZL proteins are prevalent in biosynthetic gene clusters. Given the distinct phylogeny of YQL and AZL proteins, we next examined their proximity to BGCs and characterized the identities of clusters containing a putative homolog. To perform this analysis, we identified all BGCs in the genomes of known Streptomyces species containing an HTH_42 protein, determined the most similar known cluster via BLAST, and extracted the distance in base pairs between the YQL/AZL gene and the nearest 3′ or 5′ end of each BGC (Fig.\\xa02A and Table\\xa0S2). Strikingly, none of the 442 YQL genes localize to within 20\\u2009kb of the most proximal gene cluster in that organism (Fig.\\xa02B). In contrast, AZL genes are primarily found inside or in close genomic proximity to clusters, with an average distance of roughly 2.3\\u2009kb from the nearest BGC (compared to 25\\u2009kb for YQL). Despite their sequence similarity to AZLs, the AZL2 proteins are more like YQL in that they also are not observed within 20\\u2009kb of a BGC (Table\\xa0S2). FIG\\xa02Streptomyces AZL proteins are found in diverse uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters.

We found that AZL proteins are particularly enriched in uncharacterized Streptomyces BGCs, with 68 homologs localizing within a variety of different types of clusters (Fig.\\xa02C and D and Table\\xa0S3). Almost half (n\\u2009=\\u200932; 47%) localize to clusters resembling those producing known DNA-damaging agents, including AZB (n\\u2009=\\u20095), LL-D4919α1 (LLD, n\\u2009=\\u20096), HED (n\\u2009=\\u20094), ficellomycin/vazabitide A (n\\u2009=\\u20095), and C-1027/leinamycin (n\\u2009=\\u20092) (12, 16–18, 40, 41). In addition, several other clusters are related to potential DNA-damaging agents on the basis of a reactive epoxide functional group in the natural product, including angucycline-like molecules (n\\u2009=\\u20094) herboxidiene and asukamycin. The remaining 10 uncharacterized BGCs are related to clusters that produce macrolides/terpenes, tambromycin-like compounds, and various RiPPs/depsipeptides (Fig.\\xa02C and D).

Download Table\\xa0S3, XLSX file, 0.01 MB. Bacterial genes of similar function or in a particular pathway are frequently clustered into neighborhoods or operons within the genome; thus, we investigated the nearest neighbors of Streptomyces YQL and AZL genes. We collected gene ontology (GO) terms describing the biological functions of the five nearest neighbors on either side of 40 YQL genes, 40 AZL genes inside BGCs, and 40 AZL genes outside BGCs, which collectively represent ∼15% of the total of all homologs. Biological processes were grouped into three categories: metabolism, signaling/cell function, and genetic information processing. Several key differences were found between the neighborhoods of AZL genes inside versus outside clusters (Fig.\\xa02E and Fig.\\xa0S2). AZL genes within BGCs were more often found near terpenoid/polyketide/nonribosomal protein synthesis and resistance/defense genes. The defense genes fell into several types: ABC transporters/permeases, α/β-fold hydrolases (VOC resistance proteins), DinB DNA-damage inducible hydrolases, and other AZL proteins. For those AZL genes found outside BGCs, there is an abundance of neighbors involved in cell wall biosynthesis, cell cycle control, and signal transduction. In contrast, there were no significant differences between AZL neighbors involved in processing genetic information inside versus outside clusters (Fig.\\xa02E). In contrast to the variation in the function of AZL gene neighbors, the functions of YQL neighbors (outside clusters) are nearly invariant and are composed of a variety of different gene types with no apparent functional connection between them (Fig.\\xa02F). The functions of many of these neighbors have not been elucidated in Streptomyces, but some are homologous to N-acetyltransferase, a two-component transcription factor/histidine kinase, and a DNA helicase (ComF) involved in transformation competence. Thus, both the sequences and the genomic neighborhoods of YQL proteins are relatively conserved and always found outside of BGCs, in contrast to the more variable copy number, sequence, and neighborhood of AZL genes prevalent within BGCs. Nearest neighbor analysis of AZL proteins. Gene ontology (GO) analysis for AZL nearest neighbors (±5 open reading frames) inside (A) and outside (B) BGCs. Venn diagrams depict the number of neighbors involved in metabolism (blue), signaling and cell function (green), and processing of genetic information (orange). The boxes represent subdivisions of each of the three functions, colored with respect to the key below. Uncharacterized/hypothetical proteins (40 inside, 90 outside) that could not be identified by homology are not included in these data. Full GO term analysis can be found in Tables S5 to S7. Download FIG\\xa0S2, EPS file, 0.9 MB. Characterized BGCs containing AZL proteins. With the discovery that a significant proportion of AZL proteins reside within BGCs, we took a closer look at the nine characterized BGCs identified to contain an AlkZ homolog in the MIBiG database (Table\\xa0S3). Four of these produce known DNA-alkylating agents (Fig.\\xa03A), which contain reactive epoxide moieties like AZB that are scaffolded on diverse natural product backbones (Fig.\\xa03A). Whereas AZB is a bifunctional alkylating agent, HED, trioxacarcin A (TXNA), and LL-D49194α1 (LLD) are monofunctional alkylating agents that react with nitrogen N 7 of guanine in specific nucleotide sequences via their epoxide rings and also intercalate the DNA helix via their planar ring systems (12, 42). TXNA and LLD clusters each contain two AlkZ paralogs (TxnU2/U4 and LldU1/U5), whereas the HED cluster contains one (HedH4) that resides between the two polyketide synthase genes.

The remaining five AZL-containing clusters in MIBiG produce compounds that are not known to alkylate DNA but that share some structural characteristics with the alkylating agents described above (Fig.\\xa03B). Aclacinomycin contains an anthracycline core surrounded by sugars that allow it to intercalate into DNA and act as a topoisomerase I poison, potentially generating downstream DNA damage (43). Asukamycin contains a modified PKS scaffold and an electrophilic epoxide ring and has been shown to act as both a farsenyltransferase inhibitor and a molecular glue between the UBR7 E3 ubiquitin ligase and the TP53 tumor suppressor, leading to cell death (44, 45). Armeniaspirol contains a unique chlorinated pyrrole and inhibits the AAA+ proteases ClpXP and ClpYQ, leading to cell division arrest in Gram-positive bacteria (46). The other two BGCs produce compounds of known structure but unknown function. Tambromycin and JBIR-34/35 are similar NRPS compounds containing densely substituted chlorinated indole and methyloxazoline moieties (47). The presence of AZL proteins in these clusters suggests that these compounds are genotoxins or otherwise react with DNA and/or that these particular AZL homologs have a function outside DNA repair. The AZL protein within the HED BGC is a DNA glycosylase specific for HED-DNA lesions and provides cellular resistance to HED toxicity. The alkZ gene embedded within the AZB BGC provides exquisite resistance to the potent cytotoxicity of this natural product (27, 28). To determine if AlkZ homologs other than those in the AZB BGC provide self-resistance to their cognate natural products, we characterized the DNA glycosylase and cellular resistance activities of HedH4 for HED-DNA adducts. HED is a potent antibiotic/antitumor agent that induces a strong DNA damage response (48). The bisepoxide side chain alkylates the N7 position of guanines in 5′-(C/T)G sequences (Fig.\\xa04A), the highly oxidized aromatic polyketide intercalates the DNA helix, and two C-glycosidic linked aminosugars interact with the minor groove (12). We generated site-specifically labeled HED-guanosine adducts in DNA by reacting purified compound with an oligonucleotide containing a HED target sequence, d(TGTA). The HED-DNA adduct was stable relative to other N7-alkylguanine lesions as judged by thermal depurination (Fig.\\xa0S3B) (31, 49). We first assessed the ability of purified HedH4 to hydrolyze HED-DNA using a gel-based glycosylase assay that monitors alkaline cleavage of the AP site product (30, 31). Reaction of HedH4 with HED-DNA followed by hydroxide work-up resulted in β- and δ-elimination products, consistent with production of an AP site from DNA glycosylase-mediated excision of the N-glycosidic bond of the HED-guanosine nucleotide (Fig.\\xa04A and B). We verified the identity of the excision product as HED-guanine by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) (Fig.\\xa04C). To verify that the HED-guanine product was not generated by a contaminating enzyme and to examine the conservation of the catalytic QΦQ motif, we purified alanine mutants of the two glutamine residues and tested their activity under single-turnover conditions (Fig.\\xa04D and Fig.\\xa0S3A and C). The calculated rate constant (kcat) for wild-type HedH4 was at least 7.8\\u2009±\\u20090.5\\u2009min−1 (the reaction was complete at the earliest time point). Relative to the wild type, the Q41A mutant was at least 225-fold slower (kcat = 0.04\\u2009±\\u20090.01\\u2009min−1) and the Q43A mutant at least 10-fold slower (kcat = 0.8\\u2009±\\u20090.2\\u2009min−1), indicating that both Gln residues in the HedH4 QΦQ play a role in HED-guanine excision. FIG\\xa04HedH4 excises hedamycin-guanine adducts from DNA and provides cellular resistance to hedamycin toxicity. (A) HED modification of deoxyguanosine in DNA forms a HED-DNA adduct that is hydrolyzed by HedH4 to generate an abasic (AP) site in the DNA and free HED-guanine.

We probed specificity of HedH4 for HED-DNA adducts, first by asking whether the HED-guanosine lesion was a substrate for other bacterial alkylpurine DNA glycosylases with various specificities. E. coli AlkA and YcaQ and Bacillus cereus AlkC and AlkD excise a relatively broad range of alkyl-DNA adducts (31, 50–55). S. sahachiroi AlkZ, S. bottropensis TxnU2 and TxnU4, and S. vinaceusdrappus LldU1 and LldU5, like HedH4, are found in BGCs that produce bulky N7-alkyl- and intercalating DNA adducts (Fig.\\xa03A), and each is specific for their cognate toxin (31, 56). Compared to HedH4, which excises 100% of the HED-guanine from DNA, none of the 10 alkylpurine DNA glycosylases tested showed any appreciable activity for HED-DNA after 1\\u2009h (Fig.\\xa04E). Thus, the HED-DNA adduct is hydrolyzed only by the glycosylase found in the HED BGC. We next examined the ability of HedH4 to excise N7-alkylpurine lesions that act as substrates for other YQL and AZL enzymes. Interestingly, HedH4 showed no significant activity for the simple methyl adduct 7mG, which is removed by most alkylpurine DNA glycosylases, including E. coli YcaQ and S. sahachiroi AlkZ (Fig.\\xa04F). HedH4 was also unable to hydrolyze TXNA-guanosine, a substrate for TxnU4 from the TXNA BGC (Fig.\\xa04F) (56). We also tested the ability of HedH4 to unhook ICLs derived from AZB (Fig.\\xa01A) and an 8-atom nitrogen mustard, NM8 (Fig.\\xa04G), which are substrates for S. sahachiroi AlkZ and E. coli YcaQ, respectively. Compared to AlkZ and YcaQ, HedH4 showed little to no activity for either ICL. Thus, HedH4 is highly specific for DNA adducts derived from its cognate natural product. We next tested if the hedH4 gene provides heterologous resistance to HED cytotoxicity in cells. E. coli transformed with either vector containing hedH4 constitutively expressed at low levels or vector alone were grown in the presence of increasing amounts of HED (Fig.\\xa0S3D to G). HedH4 provided modest protection against HED, as cells expressing HedH4 grew to a higher density at all HED concentrations (Fig.\\xa04I and Fig.\\xa0S3F and G) and had a higher 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) than cells treated with vector alone (HedH4, 5.9\\u2009μM\\u2009±\\u20090.7; vector, 3.9\\u2009μM\\u2009±\\u20090.4). The sensitivity differences between HedH4 and the vector control were more pronounced from a colony dilution assay performed under log-phase growth conditions (Fig.\\xa04J). Cells expressing empty vector displayed an IC50 value of 11.1\\u2009±\\u20091.5\\u2009μM, while cells expressing HedH4 displayed a 4-fold reduction in sensitivity to HED (48.1\\u2009±\\u200913.8\\u2009μM). These results indicate that HedH4 is a DNA glycosylase specific for HED-DNA adducts and provides resistance to cells exposed to the antibiotic. YQL proteins from Actinobacteria hydrolyze simple N7-alkylguanosine lesions and interstrand cross-links. We previously characterized E. coli YcaQ to have robust activity toward 7mG and NM-ICLs (Fig.\\xa01B and 4G), a substrate preference distinct from AZB- and HED-specific S. sahachiroi AlkZ and HedH4 (Fig.\\xa04F and H) (31). We therefore were interested in determining if other proteins of the YQL subfamily were functional YcaQ orthologs. We purified YQL proteins from the Actinobacteria Thermomonospora curvata and Thermobifida fusca and tested their ability to hydrolyze 7mG and unhook NM8-ICLs (Fig.\\xa05). Both proteins showed significant activity for both substrates, providing evidence that the YQL subfamily in general has comparable specificity for simple N7-alkylguanine lesions, distinguishing it biochemically from the AZL subfamily.

       " 'Statistics of antibiotic resistance open reading frames Non-redundant gene catalogs resulting from mWGS were subjected to Blastp with CARD (the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database) in order to detect and characterize ORFs referring to the ARGs and metabolic processes existing in the rhizobiome of Moringa oleifera and surrounding bulk soil microbiomes. Unique ORFs described in Supplementary Tables 2, 3 were generated either from assembled reads of a given soil sample or from scaftigs resulted from gathering and re-assembling unassembled reads of all samples (NOVO_MIX) referring to low abundant reads, respectively. The two tables described these ORFs, after being aligned with analog sequences in CARD, in terms of the mismatch and gap sizes (in nt) and nucleotides assigning gene start and end points. A total of 809 and 1,142 ORFs were generated from the two previously mentioned categories of gene assembly (Supplementary Tables 2, 3, respectively). Of which, a number of 1,416 ORFs across the two categories of gene assembly referring to a total of 183 ARGs were detected (Supplementary Table 4). The results in Supplementary Table 4 indicated that a number of 79 of these ARGs was represented by only a single ORF (referring to non-abundant ARGs), while the other ARGs were represented by two or more ORFs (referring to abundant, highly abundant, and the most highly abundant ARGs). Supplementary Figure 1 indicated the 30 most abundant ARGs referring to the top highly abundant ARGs with > 20 ORFs/ARG. Supplementary Table 4 indicates that the most highly abundant ARGs include mtrA (189 ORFs), soxR (104 ORFs), oleC (103 ORFs), golS (88 ORFs), and novA (74 ORFs) genes. Differential abundance of antibiotic resistance genes The results in Figure 1 indicated almost no differences in the total number of ARGs in samples of the two soil type (average of ∼125 ARGs/sample), while abundance of these ARGs in terms of ORFs/ARG was extremely higher in rhizosphere of M. oleifera than that in bulk soil microbiome. Supplementary Table 4 indicates abundance of ARGs across types of microbiome surrounding M. oleifera, while Figure 2 refers to the most highly abundant ARGs with > 20 ORFs/ARG. Abundance of these 14 ARGs in samples within each soil type was homogeneous, except for three genes, e.g., myrA, vanSO and dfrA3, that showed non-homogeneous abundance of ORFs among bulk soil microbiome samples (Supplementary Table 5). These three ARGs were not analyzed further. FIGURE 1Number (A) and abundance (no.

Patterned columns refer to ARGs whose numbers of ORFs in bulk soil samples are non-homogeneous. Box colors of other ARGs match those of Figure 4. Estimated abundance (in unit ppm) of ARGs for the different samples of the two types of microbiomes is shown in Supplementary Table 5, while the most highly abundant ARGs (>20 ORFs/ARG) in microbiomes of the two soil types are shown in Figure 3A and described based on CARD information in Supplementary Table 6. The results in the table indicated that abundance of ARGs with > 20 ORFs/ARG was significantly higher in rhizobiome than that of bulk soil microbiome, except for golS gene, that showed no significant difference (P = 0.315) between samples of the two soil types. The results of relative abundance of ARGs supported those of abundance only for mtrA, novA, and parY mutant, as relative abundance of these three ARGs in rhizobiome is higher than that of bulk soil microbiome (Figure 3B). However, the results for golS (Pontel et al., 2007) and rpoB2 (Ishikawa et al., 2006) genes showed higher relative abundance in bulk soil microbiome than that in rhizobiome (Figures 3B, 4). We assume the results of both abundance and relative abundance of ARGs ought to be considered.

Differential abundance of bacterial phyla and antibiotic resistance mechanisms ARGs were further categorized to metabolic processes or AMR families at the bacterial phylum level (Supplementary Table 7). The analysis was focused on 12 bacterial phyla and 55 categories of ARG-related metabolic processes. Based on abundance results, Figure 5 describes the five most common phyla, e.g., Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes, and the 13 most common metabolic processes. Abundance of phyla with > 30 ORFs regardless of metabolic process, abundance of metabolic processes regardless of phylum, as well as abundance of the interaction between phyla and metabolic processes are shown in Supplementary Figures 2, 3, and 5, respectively. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria represent the most abundant bacterial phyla regardless of metabolic processes (Supplementary Figure 2). The eight most abundant metabolic processes shown in Supplementary Table 8 almost refer to all the previously detected highly abundant ARGs in Supplementary Table 6, except for rpoB2 and ileS genes, whose metabolic processes, e.g., rifamycin-resistant beta-subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) and Bifidobacterium ileS conferring resistance to mupirocin, respectively, were less abundant (with < 30, Supplementary Figure 3), thus, were not analyzed further. These selected metabolic processes refer to three resistance mechanisms (Supplementary Table 8) namely antibiotic efflux, antibiotic target alteration and antibiotic target protection.

While, colors in outer circle refer to detailed relative abundance of different metabolic processes per bacterial phylum (right side) and detailed relative abundance of different bacterial phyla per metabolic process (left side). AMR families referring to antibiotic efflux in this study include resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND), ATP-binding cassette (ABC), major facilitator superfamily (MFS) antibiotics as well as the two-component regulatory kdpDE (potassium dependent D/E) system. AMR families referring to antibiotic target alteration included glycopeptide resistance gene cluster (vanRO), aminocoumarin resistance parY and aminocoumarin self-resistance parY. While, AMR family referring to antibiotic target protection included RbpA bacterial rpoB-binding protein, only. As indicated in Supplementary Table 6, ARGs of mtrA, soxR, and golS participate in the metabolic process of RND antibiotic efflux, while oleC and novA genes participate in the metabolic process of ABC antibiotic efflux. soxR and kdpE genes participate in the metabolic processes of MFS antibiotic efflux and two-component regulatory kdpDE (potassium dependent D/E) system, respectively. Thus, soxR gene is the only participating in two metabolic processes. vanRO, parY mutant, and rbpA genes participate in the metabolic process of glycopeptide resistance gene cluster, in the metabolic process of aminocoumarin resistance/self-resistance, and in the metabolic process of RbpA bacterial rpoB-binding protein, respectively (Supplementary Table 6). The results of circle chart of Figure 5 referring to the left and right sides of inner circle support those of Supplementary Figures 2, 3 in terms of abundance, respectively. In terms of relative abundance, the results in Figure 5 (outer circle) and Supplementary Figure 4 indicate that Proteobacteria relatively dominates in terms of RND antibiotic efflux pump followed by Actinobacteria. However, the other seven metabolic processes are relatively dominated by Actinobacteria. Proteobacteria also showed high relative abundance of processes MFS antibiotic efflux pump and two-component regulatory kdpDE system. The results involving the most highly abundant ARGs, along with their metabolic processes and resistance mechanisms referring to the five bacterial phyla are summarized in Figure 6.

Different intensities of the red color of the circles refer to the level of differential abundance in bacterial phyla. Validation of the resistomic data for the two soil types surrounding M. oleifera was done at the metatranscriptomic level via qPCR (Supplementary Figure 5). The experiment involved four highly abundant ARGs namely mtrA (acc. no. ARO:3000816), soxR (acc. no. ARO:3004107), oleC (acc. no. ARO:3003748), and novA (acc. no. ARO:3002522). Metabolic process of the first two ARGs is the RND antibiotic efflux pump, while that of the second two ARGs is the ABC antibiotic efflux pump. The results of qPCR for the metatranscriptomic data in Supplementary Figure 5 align with those of the in silico genomic dataset in Figure 3.',\n",
       " '3.1. Complete Genome Information of Subtercola sp. PAMC28395 As shown in Table 1, the complete genome of PAMC28395 comprises a circular chromosome of 3,214,492 bp with a GC content of 64.5%. The number of contigs was one. A total of 2930 genes were predicted on the chromosome, of which 2849 protein-encoding genes were functionally assigned, with the remaining genes predicted as hypothetical proteins. We also found that 24 pseudogenes, six rRNA genes, 48 tRNA genes, and three other RNA genes that were distributed in the genome. The complete genome sequence of the PAMC28395 strain was deposited with an accession number of NZ_CP076547.1 in the NCBI database. The circular genome map provided a comprehensive characterization of PAMC28395. In addition, we provided classification in 20 functional COG (Cluster of Orthologous Groups) categories (Figure 1). The most numerous COG categories are amino acid transport and metabolism (category E, 489 genes), carbohydrate transport and metabolism (category G, 235 genes), transcription (category K, 215 genes), energy production and conversion (category C, 170 genes), and inorganic ion transport and metabolism (category P, 170 genes), except for unknown function genes (category S, 489 genes) (Figure 1B). The fraction of proteins from a given genome assigned to particular COG functional categories is a helpful genome feature. It has been adopted by the Genome Standards Consortium as an essential characteristic of newly sequenced genomes [34]. Based on the COG annotation results, the predicted characteristics of the bacterial genome of PAMC28395 indicate the presence of the “metabolism” group, specifically falling between categories E and G. Category E corresponds to amino acid transport and metabolism, and category G pertains to carbohydrate transport and metabolism. This suggests that the gene content related to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism is highly conserved within the genome of PAMC28395. In general, bacteria rely on cellular respiration to break down carbohydrates and obtain energy. This energy is then utilized in various cellular processes, including photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide is converted into carbohydrates. This process temporarily stores energy in high-energy molecules such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate). These metabolic mechanisms enable bacteria to adapt effectively to extreme environments [35,36]. We identified some genes related to amino acid transport, transcription, carbohydrate transport, and energy production or conversion. Thus, we predicted that this strain’s energy storage and carbohydrate metabolism functions would be higher than those of other bacteria strains because carbohydrates play a crucial role in many essential metabolic pathways. 3.2. 16S rRNA Phylogenetic Analysis and Calculation of ANI and dDDH The identification of PAMC28395 was verified using 16S rRNA sequence analysis (Figure 2A). Further phylogenetic analysis of PAMC28395′s 16S rRNA sequence in comparison with those from some representative families within Microbacteriaceae (Subtercola, Marisediminicola, Lysinibacter, Frondihabitans, and Glaciihabitans) showed that the PAMC28395 strain was most closely related to Subtercola species. This strain was phylogenetically placed with S. frigoramans and S. vilae. Results from phylogenetic analysis, the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, and EzBioCloud revealed that it was closely related to S. frigoramans K265T (99.44%), S. vilae DB165T (97.83%), and S. lobariae 9583bT (96.87%). These results confirm that the PAMC28395 strain belongs to the family Microbacteriaceae, phylum Actinobacteria. However, strain S. frigoramans K265T was reported based only on 16S rRNA sequence comparison. Since there were little chemical taxonomic and phenotypic data to support this, it was reported that strain K265 should be included in a genus as a new species, for which the name S. frigoramans gen. nov. was suggested [10]. Indeed, using a measure called “completeness” allows for a reliable calculation of sequence similarity between PCR-derived (amplified) sequences and genome-derived reference sequences for the 16S rRNA gene. EZBioCloud, a bioinformatics platform, suggests utilizing this measure for such calculations [37]. Based on the analysis conducted using EZBioCloud, it was observed that there are 94 gaps or differences in the 16S rRNA sequence between strain PAMC28395 (1531 bp sequenced from the genome) and S. frigoramans K265T (1437 bp obtained through PCR). EZBioCloud calculated the similarity based on the completeness of the reference sequences. For instance, when the completeness of S. frigoramans K265T is 99.3%, the calculated similarity with strain PAMC28395 is 99.44%. Similarly, when considering S. vilae DB165T with a completeness of 100%, the calculated similarity is 97.83%. These results suggest that strain PAMC28395 likely belongs to the Subtercola genus and exhibits similarity to S. frigoramans. However, it is important to conduct further confirmatory experiments to provide more concrete evidence. Based on the observed differences and similarities, there is a possibility that PAMC28395 could be classified as a new species within the Subtercola genus, potentially positioned between S. vilae and S. frigoramans. There is little genomic information on the Subtercola genus in the NCBI database. Not all strains mentioned above have whole genomes. Among registered strains in the NCBI database, only the two strains of PAMC28395 and AK-R2A1-2 have complete genome sequences among Subtercola species. However, strain AK-R2A1-2 has recently been identified as S. endophyticus by Jiang et al. [14]. These strains were chosen based on their whole genome sequences and placement within the same phylogenetic group in the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree. Consequently, we compared average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between our strain and five strains with the sequenced genome data (Table S1). This comparison aimed to assess the ANI values and determine the bacteria species identified between our strain and the selected reference strains. In Figure 2B, the closest ANI value between PAMC28395 and the other type of strain was 89.58%, which was considerably lower than the threshold value of 96% for the boundary of species circumscription. ANI analysis shows the average nucleotide identity of all bacterial orthologous genes classified between any two genome sequences and offers identification between bacterial strains of the same or closely related species (i.e., species showing over 96% ANI values) [38,39]. The results presented in Supplementary Table S2 provide additional evidence suggesting that PAMC28395 exhibits digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values (%) ranging from 17.9% to 60.7% when compared to the genomes of four other strains. Typically, genomes with dDDH > 70% are regarded as belonging to the same species. In addition, dDDH values ≤70% are commonly used as an indicator that the tested organism belongs to a different species than the reference strain [40]. However, the results clearly indicate that PAMC28395 is indeed a distinct species, differing from both S. frigoramans DSM13057 (60.7%) and S. vilae DB165 (18.7%). This conclusion is supported by the significantly lower values observed for PAMC28395, which fall below the 70% threshold. Therefore, both ANI and dDDH values support that PAMC28395 should be identified as a novel species between S. vilae and S. frigoramans in the Subtercola genus. Further clarification of the new species within the Subtercola genus would require additional experiments. By conducting comprehensive experiments such as phenotypic characterization, biochemical assays, growth conditions analysis, and additional genetic analysis, the potential new species’ unique characteristics and distinct traits can be elucidated, leading to more accurate classification and characterization. While phylogenetic analysis can provide valuable insights and comparing ANI and dDDH calculates the value, experimental validation is crucial for definitively establishing a new species. Thus, we have mentioned the strain as Subtercola sp. PAMC28395. 3.3. CAZyme-Encoding Genes in Subtercola sp. PAMC28395 CAZymes are carbohydrate-degrading enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides such as cellulose into simple sugars. This is crucial for the survival of bacteria. Through complete genome analysis of various strains and cold-adapted species, evolutionary insights can be revealed. For example, it has been reported that Bacillus sp. TK-2 exhibits adaptability to cold environments through the expression of CAZyme genes involved in the degradation of polysaccharides such as cellulose and hemicellulose [41]. However, the characteristics of glycogen metabolism in prokaryotes have not been well studied compared to eukaryotes. Particularly, the metabolism of microorganisms isolated from cold environments is not well known. This study predicted the role of CAZymes in cold adaptation and the characteristics of PAMC28395 involved in glycogen and trehalose metabolism. Since genes related to carbohydrate metabolism are expected to be highly conserved, we conducted a detailed analysis of CAZymes. Among a total of 2849 identified protein-encoding genes in strain PAMC28395, 92 were annotated and classified into the group of CAZymes (glycoside hydrolase, GH; glycosyltransferase, GT; carbohydrate esterase, CE; auxiliary activity, AA; polysaccharide lyase, PL; and carbohydrate-binding module, CBM) using dbCAN3. Results provided insight into the carbohydrate utilization mechanisms of strain PAMC28395. Using the Signal P tool, we predicted the retention of 12 genes encoding signal peptides in the CAZymes of strain PAMC28395. In addition, we anticipated that enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism would be distributed as follows: 31 GHs, 47 GTs, 7 CEs, 4 AAs, 3PLs, and 2 CBMs (Figure 3A). GH gene annotation revealed that the PAMC28395 genome sequence contained genes involved in glycogen and trehalose metabolism pathways, such as β-glucosidase (GH1, EC3.2.1.21), 1,4-alpha-glucan (glycogen) branching enzyme (CBM48 and GH13_9, EC 2.4.1.18), malto-oligosyltrehalose synthase (GH13_26, EC 5.4.99.15), limit dextrin alpha-1,6-maltotetraose-hydrolase (GH13_11, EC 3.2.1.196), trehalose phosphorylase (GH65, EC 2.4.1.64), and malto-oligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (GH13_10, EC 3.2.1.141) (Table 2). Glycogen is a homopolysaccharide composed of alpha-D-glucose held together by alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds. It is mainly found in animals, fungi, and bacteria. It acts as a significant source of energy storage in bacteria [42]. Organisms in cold environments require efficient energy storage systems to adapt and survive. Glycogen synthesis is one such system, particularly in bacteria which employ a passive energy-saving strategy through slow glycogen degradation in nutrient-deprived conditions. Glycogen is hypothesized to function as a long durability energy reserve, which has been reported as a Durable Energy Storage Mechanism (DESM) to account for the long-term survival of some bacteria in cold environments [43]. In recent years, there have been numerous reports on the ability of microbes isolated from cold environments to adapt to and survive in these conditions, particularly concerning glycogen metabolism identified by genome analysis. For example, Shigella sp. strain PAMC28760, Arthrobacter sp. strain PAMC25564, and Nakamurella sp. strain PAMC28650 isolated from cold environments have been reported to be able to adapt and survive in cold environments through glycogen metabolism [44,45,46]. Moreover, we found interesting CAZyme-related genes in genome information. Microbial α-galactosidases (GH36) play a crucial role in the breakdown of plant-derived α-galactosidases by human gut microbiota. Here, we identified another GH36 gene, similar to agaSK. When expressed in vivo, it might contribute to α-galactosidase activity. Enzyme AgaSK isolated from Ruminococcus gnavus E1 (RG E1) has recently been characterized as a bifunctional enzyme composed of a GH36 α-galactosidase and a kinase domain that can phosphorylate sucrose provided by raffinose hydrolysis, highlighting a putative novel glycolytic pathway in bacteria for sucrose assimilation. It shows partial plant oligosaccharide-degrading abilities. It plays an essential role in metabolizing complex oligosaccharides, working in conjunction with other GH enzymes and contributing to the degradation of mixed fibers [47]. We also identified a gene of the GH92 family as a promising candidate for a novel and highly active bacterial alpha-1,2-mannosidase. Bacterial alpha-1,2-mannosidases are attractive enzymes for in vitro enzymatic glycan modification of high-mannose-type N-glycans in natural and recombinant glycoproteins to hybrid or complex-type N-glycans. They are also appealing targets for a better understanding of how commensals and other bacteria can utilize host glycoprotein glycans to shape the microbiota community [48]. Recently, it has been shown that some bacteria can use high-mannose-type N-glycans efficiently for growth but not sialylated N-linked glycans [49,50]. 3.4. Comparison of CAZyme Patterns with Those from Closely Related Species By revealing key CAZymes involved in the cold adaptation of Subtercola species, this study offers valuable insights into the evolutionary strategies of these microorganisms. It presents exciting opportunities for developing novel biotechnological tools with diverse industrial applications. Considering the accessibility of available genome data, complete genomes of five strains, including our strain, were chosen for comparative analysis of CAZymes. Our results showed that the number of total CAZymes in each genome ranged from a minimum of 95 (PAMC28395) to a maximum of 157 (Subtercola sp. DB165). Our genome sequence analysis of the five strains confirmed our predictions, revealing a consistent pattern of 23 CAZyme genes across all strains, including AA3, AA7, CE4, CE14, CE9, GH1, GH3, GH13, GH15, GH23, GH63, GT1, GT2, GT4, GT20, GT28, GT35, GT39, GT51, GT76, GT83, CBM32, and CBM48 (Figure 3B). Of particular note, CAZyme member GH13 associated with glycogen and trehalose metabolism and energy storage was identified in all strains, suggesting its fundamental role in the degradation of glycogen and trehalose pathways. The presence of a diverse family of CAZymes and related genes for proteins with a strong ability to store and release energy in Subtercola species isolated from extreme environments highlights their adaptive strategy for survival in a cold environment. Despite being a complete genome, PAMC28395 had the fewest number of CAZyme genes among the five strains analyzed. Although CAZymes are predominantly responsible for the degradation and biosynthesis/modification of polysaccharides, not all members of this protein group are secreted. Additionally, we identified minor differences in CAZyme gene patterns among Subtercola species. However, it is noteworthy that the two genes related to α-galactosidases (GH36) and bacterial alpha-1,2-mannosidase (GH92) had the highest probability of expression in this strain. In conclusion, our genomic comparison demonstrates the potential of these strains to degrade complex polysaccharides and store energy. 3.5. Glycogen/Trehalose and Pentose Phosphate Metabolic Pathway in Subtercola sp. PAMC28395 We investigated the glycogen/trehalose and pentose phosphate metabolic pathway to confirm related cold adaptation to a cold environment in PAMC28395 (Figures S1 and S2). This analysis assumed that the PAMC28395 strain would use glycogen/trehalose and pentose phosphate metabolic pathways to obtain energy or degrade polysaccharides. These strains showed related genes for one main pathway of trehalose biosynthesis and three pathways of producing D-glucose, which is responsible for maltose recycling to maltodextrins. In addition, we can predict that these enzymes constitute another method that bacteria use for sugar uptake when their energy source is phosphoenolpyruvate. As a result, this strain probably produces polysaccharides by themselves and from an external source using phosphoenolpyruvate rather than consuming energy because they have a related recycling gene for degradation or production. To adapt and survive in a cold environment, organisms must have well-developed functional energy storage systems. Glycogen is one of the carbohydrates stored in animal cells. It is used as an energy reserve to adapt and survive in a cold environment. It has a three-dimensional molecular structure comprising the most representative α-1,4-glucoside linkage and α-1,6-glucosidase linkage among carbohydrates [51]. Enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism include glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, branching enzyme, debranching enzyme, and phosphatase. These enzymes belong to the GH 13 family of CAZymes. Understanding the regulation and function of these enzymes in glycogen metabolism is essential for comprehending the mechanisms underlying energy homeostasis and metabolic adaptation in response to cold exposure. The classical pathway (CP) of bacterial glycogen metabolism includes five essential enzymes: ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (GlgC), glycogen synthase (GlgA), glycogen branching enzyme (GlgB), glycogen phosphorylase (GlgP), and glycogen debranching enzyme (GlgX). GlgB degradation of α-1,6-linkages in the branch portion of the glycogen molecule is needed to assist GlgP in producing glucose molecules. Finally, phosphatase regulates the metabolic pathway by removing molecules containing phosphate groups generated during glycogen synthesis and breakdown processes [42,44]. Moreover, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a major pathway for glucose catabolism, along with glycolysis. However, the extent of its contribution to bacterial metabolic adaptation, particularly in the context of bacteria, remains largely unexplored. The PPP comprises two branches: an oxidative branch and a non-oxidative branch. Glucose flux through the oxidative branch generates NADPH, which is an essential reductant in anabolic processes. Meanwhile, the non-oxidative branch produces ribose-5P (R-5P) from glucose, which can be converted reversibly into glycolytic intermediates such as glyceraldehyde 3P (GA-3P) and fructose-6P (F-6P) [52,53]. Although a vast majority of bacteria isolated from extreme environments are capable of using C5 sugars as a carbon and energy source, the underlying metabolic pathways are not yet fully understood [54]. Genome sequence analysis of PAMC28395 and bioinformatic analysis have provided valuable insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptability to cold environments. The strain utilizes the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for the degradation of C5 sugars and the production of pentose phosphates necessary for anabolic processes during glucose growth. Moreover, PAMC28395 possesses a range of carbohydrate-active enzymes and pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism, enabling the degradation or production of various types of carbohydrates. These findings highlight the high adaptability of these strains to their environment, particularly cold environments. The presence of genes related to glycogen, trehalose, maltodextrin, and PPPs suggests their involvement in the degradation of polysaccharides, which may have implications for industrial applications. Microorganisms harboring these genes have the potential to produce D-glucose economically and harness their energy to thrive in cold environments. This adaptability is a characteristic often observed in bacteria thriving in extreme conditions such as cold environments. Furthermore, the results imply that the metabolism of trehalose in microorganisms depends on the specific metabolic requirements dictated by the environmental conditions they encounter. 3.6. Analysis of Secondary Metabolite BGCs and Antibiotic Resistance Genes The production of bacterial secondary metabolites has also been proposed as a strategy for adaptation to extreme environments due to their potential diversity. Typically, secondary metabolites are synthesized through biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which contain genes encoding core biosynthetic enzymes, transporters, and regulators found physically co-located. This knowledge drove us to investigate the genetic traits of the Subtercola genus evolutionarily, explicitly targeting those associated with cold environment adaptation to shed light on factors contributing to the bacterium’s diverse range of secondary metabolites. As shown in Table 3, antiSMASH analysis indicated that PAMC28395 had a total of five BGCs related to oligosaccharides, terpene, type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS), beta-lactone, and non-alpha poly-amino acids such as e-polylysin (NAPAA). Comparing putative BGCs in Subtercola sp. PAMC28395, Subtercola sp. AK-R2A1-2, Subtercola sp. Z020, S. frigoramans DSM13057, and S. vilae DB165 suggested that four clusters (terpene, T3PKS, beta-lactone, and NAPAA) were conserved with few differences (Tables S3 and S4, and Figures S3–S5). Except for AK-R2A1-2, none of the other strains had BGCs containing the redox cofactor (Figure 4A), which was thought to be associated with adaptation to low temperatures [55]. Instead, gene cluster-encoding branched-chain fatty acids/oligosaccharides were found in Subtercola sp. PAMC28395, Subtercola sp. Z020, S. frigoramans DSM13057, and S. vilae DB165, but not in Subtercola sp. AK-R2A1-2. In this gene region, while branched-chain fatty acid BGCs showed high similarity to known clusters, oligosaccharide BGCs containing three GTs were detected with low similarity to known clusters (Figure 4B). Considering that oligosaccharides are known to protect cell membranes through an ice inhibition effect [56,57], these biosynthetic genes may play an important role in the survival of those strains. As an additional analysis for the characterization of BGCs, antibiotic resistance genes were identified with the ARTS tool [33]. This tool enables prioritization of BGCs corresponding to antibiotics based on the understanding that antibiotic producers harbor self-resistance genes within the same BGCs responsible for making antibiotics [58]. Comparing antibiotic resistance genes in Subtercola sp. PAMC28395, Subtercola sp. AK-R2A1-2, Subtercola sp. Z020, S. frigoramans DSM13057, and S. vilae DB165 revealed that strain PAMC28395 contained more core genes in BGCs than other strains (Table 4). Regarding the results of Subtercola sp. Z020 and S. vilae DB165, the number of core gene hits detected in a BGC was lower than the actual value due to analysis using a draft genome. Additionally, 19 resistance model genes were detected in PAMC28395, including dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, pyruvate carboxylase, pentapeptide repeat protein, DNA gyrases, DNA topoisomerases, and ornithine carbamoyltransferases (Table S5). In particular, the beta-lactone BGC described above contained pyruvate carboxylase, suggesting the possibility of producing inhibitors of this enzyme.',\n",
       " \"Monasones are bona fide SMs of M. ruber M7. Our previous studies have indicated that MonAzPs are largely (but not entirely) absent and that trihydroxynaphthalene 2 and monasones 3 and 4 (Fig.\\xa01) are the major products of an M. ruber M7 mutant in which mrpigC, a gene within the MABGC, was deleted (16–18). This gene encodes the ketoreductase MrPigC that affords benzaldehyde 5 during MonAzP biosynthesis by reducing the C-11 ketone of the unstable intermediate 1, the putative product of MrPigA, a nonreducing polyketide synthase (nrPKS) (Fig.\\xa01). We proposed that in the absence of MrPigC, intermediate 1 undergoes spontaneous aldol condensation to yield trihydroxynaphthalene 2, and this derailment product (compound 2) is subject to spontaneous oxidization to monasone A (compound 3), which in turn may be fortuitously reduced to monasone B (compound 4) by Monascus enzymes. Therefore, we and others interpreted these results by regarding monasones as incidental shunt products that may only be obtained in substantial amounts by blocking MonAzP biosynthesis (15–17). FIG\\xa01A branching pathway yields MonAzPs and monasone congeners in M. ruber M7. The reactive polyketide intermediate 1 gives rise to MonAzPs on one branch (represented by rubropunctatin 7a and monascorubrin 7b) and to naphthoquinone congeners on the other branch (represented by trihydroxynaphthalene 2, monasone A [compound 3], monasone B [compound 4], tetralindione 8, and trihydroxytetralone MA-1 [compound 9]). The structures of the boxed compounds were elucidated by LC-MS/MS and NMR analysis (data for compounds 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 are in Table S8 and Fig. S10 [19]). A branching pathway yields MonAzPs and monasone congeners in M. ruber M7. The reactive polyketide intermediate 1 gives rise to MonAzPs on one branch (represented by rubropunctatin 7a and monascorubrin 7b) and to naphthoquinone congeners on the other branch (represented by trihydroxynaphthalene 2, monasone A [compound 3], monasone B [compound 4], tetralindione 8, and trihydroxytetralone MA-1 [compound 9]). The structures of the boxed compounds were elucidated by LC-MS/MS and NMR analysis (data for compounds 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 are in Table S8 and Fig. S10 [19]). To our surprise, we have found that cocultivation of the wild-type M. ruber M7 with various bacteria or fungi elicits the biosynthesis of compounds 2, 3, and 4 (see Table S3 in reference 19), while the production of MonAzPs remains undisturbed under these culture conditions (Table S4 [19]). All MonAzPs and the monasone congeners 2, 3, and 4 should be derived from M. ruber M7, since these compounds were not detected upon monoculture of the challenger microorganisms (Fig. S1, Penicillium expansum ATCC 7861 as an example [19]). Furthermore, we found that monasones 3 and 4 exhibit broad-spectrum antibiotic activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and antifungal activity against filamentous fungi, including the monasone-producing M. ruber strain itself (Table S5 [19]). Thus, we consider that under some ecologically relevant conditions (such as growth in mixed cultures), these supposed shunt products appear as authentic SMs that may function as allelochemicals against potential competitors of the producing fungi in their natural ecosystem (20). A nested subset of coevolving genes within the MABGC correlates with monasone production. We have confirmed that production of monasones by M. ruber M7 requires MrPigA, the nrPKS that assembles intermediate 1, since monasones 2, 3, and 4 were not produced by the ΔmrpigA knockout strain in monoculture or under monasone-eliciting cocultivation conditions (Table S3 [19]). Furthermore, bacteria and fungi did not stimulate M. ruber M7 to produce monasones when the gene mrpigB encoding MrPigB (also known as PigR) (21), the MonAzP cluster-specific positive regulator, was deleted (Table S3 [19]). To further confirm mrpigB function, we reevaluated the effects of the deletion of mrpigB on the transcription of each gene in the 16-gene MABGC by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, both under MonAzP-competent monoculture and monasone-eliciting cocultivation conditions (Fig.\\xa02a). During MonAzP-producing monoculture, all MABGC genes were expressed in the wild-type strain, apart from mrpigI that encodes a transcription factor whose role in MonAzP biosynthesis is unknown. Unexpectedly, as shown by the ΔmrpigB strain, MrPigB controls the expression of only six genes in the MABGC: mrpigA, the nrPKS; mrpigH, an enoyl reductase; mrpigM and mrpigO, an acetyltransferase-deacetylase pair; mrpigN, a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase; and mrpigP, a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter (Fig.\\xa02b) (15). Furthermore, cocultivation did not restore the expression of these six genes in the ΔmrpigB strain, indicating that transcriptional activation of these genes upon elicitation is achieved primarily through MrPigB. This tight control by a transcriptional regulator purportedly governing MonAzP production was unexpected for some of these genes, since among the six genes in the MrPigB regulon, MrPigP had been shown to be unnecessary for MonAzP production, while MrPigH plays only a supplementary role in the biosynthesis of these pigments (15–17). FIG\\xa02A conserved MrPigB regulon in MABGC-like gene clusters.

Genes encoding orthologues of the MFS transporter MrPigP (highlighted in pink) are present in the majority of the MABGC-like gene clusters. To obtain an evolutionary perspective on the MrPigB regulon, we analyzed filamentous fungal genomes available in the NCBI GenBank and in the “1000 Fungal Genomes Project” database of the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (http://1000.fungalgenomes.org, accessed 3 October 2019) for the presence of MABGC-related SM biosynthetic gene clusters. Apparent SM clusters with a gene encoding an nrPKS orthologous (>45% identity over the full length of the enzyme) to MrPigA from the MABGC of M. ruber M7 were found to exist in the genomes of 17 different fungal species from the genera Monascus, Talaromyces, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Coccidioides (Fig.\\xa02b and c). Curiously, genes for orthologues of MrPigB and those for three proteins encoded in the MrPigB regulon (MrPigA, MrPigH, and MrPigN) were seen to be cooccurring and highly conserved in all these gene clusters (Fig.\\xa02b and c). Orthologues of the multidrug transporter MrPigP are found in 11 of the 17 gene clusters (Fig.\\xa02b), while orthologues of the rest of the MonAzP genes, including those encoding MrPigM and MrPigO from the MrPigB regulon of M. ruber M7, are only present in the minority of these putative SM biosynthetic gene clusters. Monasone biosynthesis is encoded by genes in the MrPigB regulon of M. ruber M7. MrPigA was characterized in our previous work by gene knockout as the nrPKS responsible for the production of the polyketide scaffold of MonAzPs (15). MrPigA was also shown to yield large amounts of trihydroxynaphthalene 2 and smaller amounts of monasones 3 and 4 upon heterologous expression in yeast (15). In the present study, MrPigA was heterologously expressed in Aspergillus oryzae M-2-3 to yield compounds 2 and 3 (2.2 and 7.1\\u2009mg/liter) (Fig.\\xa01 and 3a). We also observed that purified trihydroxynaphthalene 2 readily autooxidized into monasone A (compound 3) in aqueous solutions under aerobic conditions (Fig. S2a [19]). Remarkably, coexpression of mrpigA and mrpigN in A. oryzae led to the production of significantly larger amounts of compounds 2 and 3 (7.2 and 18.4\\u2009mg/liter) (Fig.\\xa03a). Increased production of monasones was unexpected, as MrPigN had earlier been identified as the enzyme that is responsible for the hydroxylation of C-4 of benzaldehyde 5 during MonAzP biosynthesis (Fig.\\xa01). However, MrPigN had not been implicated in naphthoquinone production until now, and monasones 3 and 4 do not feature a C-4 tertiary alcohol. FIG\\xa03Biosynthesis of monasones during in vivo and vitro enzymatic reactions with MrPigA and MrPigN.

Statistical analysis with Student's t test revealed that there was a significant difference between group MrPigA and group MrPigA+MrPigN at P < 0.05. To further demonstrate the involvement of MrPigN in monasone biosynthesis, we expressed mrpigA and mrpigN under the strong promoter PamyB in A. oryzae M-2-3 and purified the corresponding recombinant proteins by sequential ultrafiltration, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and Ni-Sepharose column chromatography to yield 23\\u2009mg MrPigA and 42\\u2009mg MrPigN from 100 g wet mycelia (Fig. S3 [19]). Production of compound 2 was recapitulated in a reconstituted in vitro enzymatic assay with MrPigA from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), malonyl-CoA, NADPH, and S-adenosyl methionine as the substrates. Small amounts of the autooxidation product monasone A (compound 3) were also detected in the reaction. Meanwhile, recombinant MrPigN was shown to efficiently convert benzaldehyde 5 into azanigerone E (compound 6), as expected (Fig. S2b [19]). Importantly, coupled reactions with MrPigA and MrPigN afforded approximately 100% more product 2 than the reaction with MrPigA alone (Fig.\\xa03b and c). Extended in vitro reactions with MrPigA and MrPigN also yielded minor amounts of tetralindione 8, the C-4 hydroxylated analogue of trihydroxynaphthalene 2 (Fig.\\xa03b). MA-1 (compound 9) that derives from compound 8 by reduction was also detected in fermentations with A. oryzae strains coexpressing mrpigA and mrpigN (Fig.\\xa03a), just as with recombinant yeast expressing these two genes, or with the ΔmrpigC knockout mutant of M. ruber M7 (15, 17). Taken together, these observations indicate that MrPigN not only is involved in MonAzP biosynthesis but also facilitates the formation of trihydroxynaphthalene 2, the precursor of monasones. To account for this result, we propose that during MonAzP biosynthesis, benzaldehyde 5 is readily hydroxylated by MrPigN to yield azanigerone E (compound 6) (Fig.\\xa01). However, in the absence of MrPigC, MrPigN may also intercept intermediate 1, and the binding may assist the folding of this reactive intermediate into a pose conducive to the aldol condensation in the C1-C10 register, thereby increasing the yield of trihydroxynaphthalene 2 and its naphthoquinone derivatives. Importantly, compounds 2, 3, and 4 were not accepted as the substrates for C-4 hydroxylation by MrPigN (Fig. S2c [19]), while intermediate 1 may not be a preferred substrate for hydroxylation, as shown by the very small amounts of compound 8 produced in the MrPigA+MrPigN coupled enzymatic assay and the low yield of MA-1 (compound 9) during the coexpression of the corresponding genes in heterologous hosts. The genes mrpigM and mrpigO encode an acetyltransferase-deacetylase pair necessary for MonAzP biosynthesis. Although these genes are part of the MrPigB regulon in M. ruber M7, they are not conserved in MABGC-like biosynthetic gene clusters (Fig.\\xa02). Deletion of these genes did not influence monasone congener production in ΔmrpigM and ΔmrpigO strains upon monoculture or during cocultivation with P. expansum ATCC 7861 (Table S3 [19]), indicating that the corresponding enzymes do not participate in monasone biosynthesis. Reductive transformations of monasones by MrPigH may contribute to self-resistance. The MABGC gene mrpigH is part of the MrPigB regulon in strain M7, and orthologues of MrPigH are encoded by all of the MABGC-related SM biosynthetic gene clusters detected in databases (Fig.\\xa02). MrPigH was proposed to contribute to, but is not strictly necessary for, the reduction of the C5(2′) double bond in MonAzP intermediates en route to the classical yellow MonAzPs monascin and ankaflavin (15, 16). MrPigH is a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase similar to enol reductases acting on various aromatic hydrocarbon substrates (22). Since monasones 3 and 4 feature enol groups, we wondered whether MrPigH may also be involved in the biosynthesis of naphthoquinone derivatives. Thus, we turned to in vitro reconstitution of the MrPigH-catalyzed reaction. The gene encoding MrPigH was expressed in A. oryzae M-2-3 under the inducible promoter PamyB, and 73\\u2009mg of MrPigH was purified from 100 g wet mycelia (Fig. S3 [19]). Considering that reductases such as MrPigH may yield different products under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions (23), we conducted in vitro assays under both conditions with recombinant MrPigH. When monasone A (compound 3) was used as the substrate in the presence of NADPH, distinct product pairs were detected under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions (compounds 10 and 11 versus 14 and 17, respectively) (Fig.\\xa04). The structures of all four products were elucidated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Table S8 and Fig. S10 [19]). We conclude that MrPigH catalyzes a stepwise reduction sequence. Under aerobic conditions, reduction of the C4(5) enol yields the 4,5-dihydronaphthoquinone 10 with a secondary alcohol at C-5, followed by a further reduction to afford the 5,6-diol 11 (Fig.\\xa04a and b). Under anaerobic conditions, monasone A (compound 3) was converted by MrPigH into the tetrahydroxynaphthalene 14 by reductive aromatization, and further reduced and dearomatized to form the tetrahydroxytetralin 17 (Fig.\\xa04a and c). Formation of tetrahydroxynaphthalene 14 was observed only under anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, while purified compound 14 was stable in the absence of oxygen in aqueous solutions, it was spontaneously oxidized to monasone A in the presence of oxygen (Fig. S4 [19]).

We previously observed the cooccurrence of monasone B (compound 4) with its congener monasone A (compound 3) in M. ruber M7 and in recombinant yeast and A. oryzae strains expressing mrpigA (15, 16). To account for the reduction of the carbonyl at C-11 of monasone A (compound 3), we decided to investigate MrPigC that reduces the analogous carbonyl in the putative nrPKS product 1. We purified the recombinant enzyme from A. oryzae expressing the mrpigC gene (Fig. S3 [19]) and used the clarified mycelial lysate of the ΔmrpigC knockout strain of M. ruber M7 as a control. To our surprise, both purified MrPigC and the MrPigC-free M. ruber M7 protein extract catalyzed the facile conversion of monasone A (compound 3) to monasone B (compound 4) (Fig.\\xa04a; Fig. S5a [19]). Similarly, both purified MrPigC and the ΔmrpigC lysate efficiently reduced the C-11 carbonyl of trihydroxytetralone 11 to afford compound 12 (Fig.\\xa04a; Fig. S5b [19]), that of tetrahydroxynaphthalene 14 to produce compound 15 (Fig.\\xa04a; Fig. S5c, anaerobic conditions [19]), and that of tetrahydroxytetralin 17 to yield compound 16 (Fig.\\xa04a; Fig. S5d [19]). Compounds 4, 12, 15, and 16 were isolated and characterized (Table S8 and Fig. S10 [19]). These experiments indicate that MrPigC shows considerable substrate promiscuity paired with strict regiospecificity in reducing the C-11 carbonyl of benzaldehyde (compound 1), naphthoquinone (compound 3), tetrahydroxynaphthalene (compound 14), tetrahydroxytetralin (compound 17), and trihydroxytetralone (compound 11) scaffolds (Fig.\\xa04a). Apparently, M. ruber M7 also expresses another enzyme(s) that is able to carry out this same C-11 reduction, as was seen earlier with the ΔmrpigC strain that still produced small amounts of MonAzP congeners (15). Fittingly, the M. ruber M7 genome encodes two orthologues of MrPigC (GME804_g and GME2122_g, with 46% and 33% identities to MrPigC, respectively), although the role(s) of these proteins in these reductions would need to be confirmed by further experiments. We also demonstrated that the recombinant MrPigH enzyme can catalyze enol reduction with monasone B (compound 4) as the substrate, affording trihydroxytetralone 12 under aerobic conditions through the putative intermediate 13 (Fig.\\xa04a and d). MrPigH is also able to convert monasone B (compound 4) to tetrahydroxytetralin 16 through intermediate 15 under anaerobic conditions (Fig.\\xa04a and d). All these reactions catalyzed by MrPigH and MrPigC form a complex metabolic grid that transforms monasone A (compound 3) to trihydroxytetralone 12 through a six-electron reduction sequence under aerobic conditions or to tetrahydroxytetralin 16 through an eight-electron reduction sequence under anaerobic conditions (Fig.\\xa04a). We have also tried to validate the contributions of MrPigH to monasone transformations in vivo. Despite our best efforts, we were unsuccessful in knocking out or silencing the mrpigH gene in M. ruber M7. Similarly, replacing the promoter of mrpigH with an inducible one such as Padh1 or Pcbh1 was also unsuccessful. However, MrPigH-generated compounds 10, 11, 12, and 16 were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in fermentations of wild-type M. ruber M7 under monasone-eliciting cocultivation conditions but not in monoculture (Table S6 [19]). Strikingly, the ΔmrpigC knockout mutant produced all naphthoquinone congeners (compounds 2 to 4, 10 to 12, and 14 to 17) under cocultivation conditions, presumably due to the additional C-11 ketoreductase activity of the fungus (Table S6 [19]). Next, we coexpressed mrpigH with mrpigA and mrpigN in A. oryzae M-2-3. Compared to that in the A. oryzae strain expressing mrpigA and mrpigN, production of trihydroxynaphthalene 2 and monasone A (compound 3) was drastically reduced (Fig. S6a [19]). However, compounds 4, 10 to 12, and 14 to 17 were not detected in the A. oryzae production system (Fig. S6 [19]). Feeding any one of the compounds 2 to 4, 10 to 12, or 14 to 17 (each at 0.5\\u2009mg/liter) to A. oryzae M-2-3 showed that compounds 2 and 3 are stable, but compounds 4, 10 to 12, and 14 to 17 disappear during incubation with mycelia of this host (Fig. S6 and Table S7 [19]). Thus, naphthoquinone congeners produced by MrPigH from compounds 2 and 3 are readily catabolized by endogenous enzymes of the Aspergillus host. Monasone A (compound 3) and B (compound 4) were confirmed to show antifungal and broad-spectrum antibacterial activities, as expected (Table S5 [1, 2, 19]). However, compounds 12 and 16, the reduced derivatives of monasones A and B, displayed no antifungal or antibiotic activities against the same panel of microorganisms (Table S5 [19]). Intriguingly, while monasones A and B displayed self-toxicity to the producer fungus M. ruber M7, compounds 12 and 16 were found not to be growth inhibitory. Considering that the production of MrPigH is coregulated with the enzymes that produce monasones 3 and 4, these results suggest that the reductive transformations initiated by MrPigH may contribute to the self-resistance of M. ruber M7 against these compounds. MrPigP is a monasone exporter that also contributes to self-resistance in M. ruber M7. The MrPigB regulon of M. ruber M7 includes the gene mrpigP that encodes a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) multidrug transporter. MrPigP is not necessary for MonAzP production, as ΔmrpigP knockout strains continue to produce these azaphilone pigments undisturbed (18, 24). Although MrPigP orthologues are not universally conserved in MABGC-like clusters in fungi, we were intrigued by the possibility that MrPigP may be involved in the efflux of naphthoquinone congeners, at least in M. ruber M7. To test this hypothesis, we constructed the mrpigP gene knockout mutant (ΔmrpigP) and the mrpigP-complemented knockout strain (CΔmrpigP) (Fig. S7 [19]). Then, we compared the antifungal activities of monasones A and B and their reduced derivatives 12 and 16 against those of the wild-type M. ruber M7 and the ΔmrpigP and CΔmrpigP strains. The ΔmrpigP strain turned out to be markedly more sensitive to monasone A (compound 3) and monasone B (compound 4) than the wild type or the complemented strains (Fig.\\xa05a and b and Table S5 [19]) while just as resistant to compounds 12 and 16 as the wild type or the complemented strain.

Data from all quantitative experiments are shown as the means ± SDs from three independent experiments of three replicates each, n\\u2009=\\u20099. Next, we performed flux assays with the same compound-strain combinations. Mycelia of wild-type M. ruber M7, ΔmrpigP, and CΔmrpigP strains were grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) for 7\\u2009days and then transferred to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing monasone A (compound 3), monasone B (compound 4), compound 12, or compound 16. After 6\\u2009h, the intracellular concentration of monasone A or B in the ΔmrpigP strain was found to be considerably higher than in the wild type or the CΔmrpigP strain (Fig.\\xa05c; Fig. S8 [19]). However, the intracellular concentrations of compounds 12 and 16 displayed no obvious differences among the wild-type, ΔmrpigP, and CΔmrpigP strains under the same conditions. We also used qRT-PCR to quantify the expression of the mrpigP gene when M. ruber M7 was grown for 5\\u2009days in the presence of different concentrations of monasone A (compound 3), monasone B (compound 4), compound 12, or compound 16. The results indicated a notable increase in mrpigP expression with increasing concentrations of monasone A or monasone B (Fig.\\xa05d; Fig. S9 [19]). Incubation with compound 12 or 16 led to only a weak induction of mrpigP expression (Fig. S9 [19]). Finally, to exclude a determining role of MrPigP in MonAzP export, we compared the intracellular and the extracellular concentrations of representative MonAzPs in the wild-type M. ruber M7 and the ΔmrpigP strains at mid-production phase (fermentations usually complete in 12 to 15\\u2009days). No obvious difference was detected between the two strains (Fig.\\xa05e and f). Taken together, these experiments confirm that MrPigP is not involved in MonAzP biosynthesis or export, as suggested earlier (15–17). Instead, it is a naphthoquinone-inducible and naphthoquinone-specific transporter that contributes to the self-resistance of M. ruber M7 to monasone A (compound 3) and B (compound 4).\",\n",
       " 'Regio- and stereoselective N-acetylation of paenilamicin by PamZ To confirm our hypothesis that PamZ (NCBI WP_023484187) is an acetyl-CoA-dependent N-acetyltransferase that targets paenilamicins, we monitored PamZ-mediated antibacterial effects in vitro by agar diffusion assays against Bacillus megaterium (B. megaterium) as indicator strain as well as by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To this end, the pamZ gene was amplified from the wild-type (WT) P. larvae ERIC II strain, inserted into the commercial pET28a(+) vector, and transformed into E. coli BL21-Gold(DE3) for heterologous expression. PamZ was then purified (Supplementary Fig.\\xa01) and used for the assays including four native paenilamicin variants as substrates and acetyl-CoA as co-substrate. The paenilamicin variants were purified from P. larvae ERIC I and ERIC II, which preferably produce the paenilamicin mixtures A2/B2 and A1/B1, respectively (Fig.\\xa01 and Supplementary Fig.\\xa02). In addition, we also tested synthetic paenilamicin B2 (PamB2_3)29. The agar diffusion assays clearly showed that paenilamicins incubated with PamZ and acetyl-CoA were not able to inhibit the growth of B. megaterium, whereas antibacterial activity was observed in the absence of acetyl-CoA and/or PamZ (Fig.\\xa02). This loss of biological activity correlated with the conversion of paenilamicins to the corresponding N-acetylpaenilamicins as observed by HPLC-ESI-MS. ESI mass spectra revealed that the mass-to-charge ratios of natural and synthetic paenilamicins exhibited a characteristic mass shift of 42\\u2009Da indicative of the addition of an acetyl group (Supplementary Figs.\\xa03–7).Fig. 2Deactivation of paenilamicins through PamZ-mediated N-acetylation tested by agar diffusion assay against B. megaterium as the indicator strain.Paenilamicin variants (PamA1, A2, B1, B2) isolated from P. larvae and synthetic paenilamicin B2 (PamB2_3) were incubated in vitro with both acetyl-CoA and PamZ (1), acetyl-CoA only (2), or PamZ only (3). Samples 2 and 3 are negative controls and indicate the lack of bacterial growth. Fig. 2Deactivation of paenilamicins through PamZ-mediated N-acetylation tested by agar diffusion assay against B. megaterium as the indicator strain.Paenilamicin variants (PamA1, A2, B1, B2) isolated from P. larvae and synthetic paenilamicin B2 (PamB2_3) were incubated in vitro with both acetyl-CoA and PamZ (1), acetyl-CoA only (2), or PamZ only (3). Samples 2 and 3 are negative controls and indicate the lack of bacterial growth. Deactivation of paenilamicins through PamZ-mediated N-acetylation tested by agar diffusion assay against B. megaterium as the indicator strain. Paenilamicin variants (PamA1, A2, B1, B2) isolated from P. larvae and synthetic paenilamicin B2 (PamB2_3) were incubated in vitro with both acetyl-CoA and PamZ (1), acetyl-CoA only (2), or PamZ only (3). Samples 2 and 3 are negative controls and indicate the lack of bacterial growth. Paenilamicin contains several primary and secondary amino groups that are potential candidates for N-acetylation. To determine the site of acetylation, we monitored PamZ-mediated effects in fingerprint tandem MS and NMR spectra of paenilamicin before and after treatment with PamZ/acetyl-CoA. Besides the mass shift of 42\\u2009Da for the acetylation, characteristic MS2 fragmentation patterns originated from the difference between Glm and Aga residues in series A and B (+28\\u2009Da) as well as the difference between Lys and Orn residues in series 1 and 2 (+14\\u2009Da). MS2 fragmentation mainly resulted in fragment ions b4, y4 and y6 of each paenilamicin and N-acetylpaenilamicin variant acquired by collision-induced dissociation (Supplementary Table\\xa01). Fragment ion b4 varied depending on the paenilamicin series showing mass shifts of 14\\u2009Da and 28\\u2009Da. Importantly, we observed a mass shift of 42\\u2009Da only for fragment ion b4, indicating acetylation in the N-terminal half of paenilamicin. By contrast, the fragment ions y4 and y6 did not exhibit any mass shifts of 42\\u2009Da between paenilamicins and N-acetylpaenilamicins. Thus, we excluded acetylation in the C-terminal half of paenilamicin (Supplementary Figs.\\xa08–18). In addition, we detected and isolated small amounts of N-acetylpaenilamicin A1, B1, and B2 from supernatants of P. larvae ERIC I and ERIC II (Supplementary Fig.\\xa019), and compared them with our products formed in vitro. The MS2 fragmentation analysis confirmed that the mono-acetylation in the N-terminal half of paenilamicin also occurred in vivo (Supplementary Figs.\\xa020–22). The MS2 experiments did not reveal whether the N-terminal amino group of Aga/Glm or its side chain (amino/guanidino group) was acetylated. To ultimately identify the functional group that is modified by PamZ, we acquired 1H-13C hetero-nuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra of paenilamicin B2 before and after incubation with PamZ/acetyl-CoA. Although both spectra were mostly superimposable, severe chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) were observed for a minor fraction of cross-peaks (Fig.\\xa03a). Mapping CSPs onto the structure of paenilamicin B2 revealed a well-defined region comprising the N-terminal half, with the strongest effect being located at position 6 of Aga (Fig.\\xa03b and Supplementary Table\\xa02). N-acetylpaenilamicin B2 also showed an additional cross-peak compared to paenilamicin B2, which we tentatively assigned to the methyl moiety of the newly attached acetyl group (Fig.\\xa03a). Our data unequivocally demonstrated that PamZ mono-N-acetylates the N-terminal amino group at Aga-6 position of paenilamicin and thereby abolishes its antibacterial activity. Ultimately, this result is further supported by two synthetic diastereomers of paenilamicin B2 with l- instead of the native d-configuration at Aga-6 (PamB2_1 and PamB2_2), that were both antibacterially less active29 and that were not modified by PamZ (Fig.\\xa04 and Supplementary Fig.\\xa023).Fig. 3Identification of the N-acetylation site through 2D NMR spectroscopy.a Overlay of relevant 1H-13C HSQC sections of paenilamicin B2 (black) and N-acetylpaenilamicin B2 (blue).

The structure of PamZ:acetyl-CoA binary complex A BLAST30 search indicated that PamZ belongs to the GNAT superfamily with a sequence identity of 31% to the N-acetyltransferase, ZmaR, whose structure has not yet been determined and which confers resistance against the aminopolyol peptide antibiotic, zwittermicin A, in Bacillus cereus UW85 (Supplementary Fig.\\xa024)31. We solved the crystal structure of PamZ in complex with acetyl-CoA at a resolution of 1.34\\u2009Å by using the uncharacterized N-acetyltransferase from Streptococcus suis 89/1591 (PDB 3G3S) for molecular replacement (Supplementary Table\\xa03). The electron density was of excellent quality, allowed the modeling of the entire polypeptide chain, and unambiguously revealed the bound acetyl-CoA (Supplementary Fig.\\xa025). PamZ comprises an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–128, secondary structure elements indicated by primes) and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 140–275), which both adopt the characteristic GNAT fold (Fig.\\xa05a)32. The two tandem-GNAT domains, that may have originated from a gene duplication event, share low sequence identity (<20%) and are connected by an α-helical linker (αbridge, residues 129–139). The overall fold of each domain is very similar to that of bacterial aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases (AACs), as pairwise structural alignments with several AACs (PDB\\xa01BO4, 1M4I, 1S3Z) gave root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of 2.9–4.2\\u2009Å for both the NTD and CTD (Supplementary Fig.\\xa026)33. A structural superposition of the NTD and CTD of PamZ yielded an RMSD of 4.2\\u2009Å for 75 pairs of Cα atoms (Supplementary Fig.\\xa027)33.Fig. 5X-ray crystal structure of Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase PamZ.a Structural topology of PamZ with its characteristic tandem-GNAT fold.

GNAT is an abbreviation of Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (Gcn5: general control non-repressed protein 5). However, a comparison with the typical GNAT fold revealed several unique features in PamZ. Instead of two N-terminal α-helices, α1 and α2, both domains of PamZ contain three short helical segments, α0-α1-α2 (α0’–α1’–α2’), which pack onto one face of the central antiparallel β-sheet, β2–β3–β4 (β2’–β3’–β4’), whereas helix α3 (α3’) buries its other side. A kink in the backbone conformation of strand β3, involving residues T199 and C200, causes a strong right twist and thus a distortion of the antiparallel β3–β4 arrangement, which led us to discriminate these strands as β3a/β3b and β4a/β4b (Fig.\\xa05a). The central β-sheet is extended by strand β5’ in the NTD, whereas the CTD shows the characteristic β-bulge of GNAT enzymes\\xa0—\\xa0a V-shaped cavity between strands β4b and β5 accommodates the pantetheine segment of CoA (Fig.\\xa06a). Furthermore, the well-conserved pyrophosphate-binding loop (P-loop) of the GNAT family (R/Q-X-X-G-X-A/G)26 is only present in the CTD of PamZ (Q-N-K-G-L-A) between strand β4b and helix α3 (Fig.\\xa06a)34, whereas the NTD is missing this signature motif. Accordingly, there is only one acetyl-CoA molecule canonically bound in the PamZ structure, namely to the CTD.Fig. 6Active site of PamZ.a Motifs A (β4–α3) and B (β5–α4) located in the C-terminal domain (CTD) interact with co-substrate acetyl-CoA. b Close-up view of the active site displaying the negatively charged groove (color code as in Fig.\\xa05c). c Highlighted amino acid residues with hydrogen-donating and -accepting groups form the groove and are well-positioned to potentially interact with the substrate paenilamicin.

Hence, we concluded that the NTD is incompetent in binding acetyl-CoA and rather plays a structural role, in particular for substrate binding (see below). Notably, many GNAT enzymes exist as homodimers in solution with various arrangements of the monomer-monomer interface32. Likewise, AACs have often been crystallographically observed in a homodimeric state, although their quaternary structure in solution may vary35. PamZ exists as a monomer, both in solution and in the crystal (Supplementary Fig.\\xa028). However, the tandem-GNAT domain constellation of PamZ achieves an intramolecular domain-domain interface that resembles that of some GNAT homodimers. There are several GNAT enzymes that utilize domain swapping of strand β6 to stabilize their homodimeric structure34,36,37. Interestingly, a major interface in PamZ is achieved by domain swapping of strand β6 (β6’), which inserts between strands β5’ and β6’ (β5 and β6) of the opposing domain and thus forms an extended, antiparallel, and strongly-twisted β-sheet throughout the enzyme (Fig.\\xa05b). This β-sheet is only interrupted by the β-bulge in the CTD accommodating the cofactor and allowing the amide groups of its pantetheine portion to form pseudo-β-sheet hydrogen bonds to strand β4b (Fig.\\xa06a). A very similar tandem arrangement of a pseudo-GNAT NTD and a canonical GNAT CTD can be found in the template protein (PDB 3G3S). Another example is the structure of mycothiol synthase MshD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is also organized as a tandem repeat of two GNAT domains with a catalytically inactive NTD38. PamZ appears to utilize its NTD to form a well-defined substrate pocket with strands β5 and β6’ representing its floor. A second interface between the NTD and CTD is accomplished through tight packing of helix α2’ onto the small β3b–β4a sheet. Further interactions involve helix α2 of the CTD and the loops between α2’ and β2’ as well as β3’ and β4’ of the NTD. These inter-domain contacts fully cover the central groove that is normally found at the interface of homodimeric structures of GNAT enzymes and restrict substrate entry to the opening that is also used by the cofactor. This remaining cleft between the two domains of PamZ is decorated with several acidic residues (e.g. E89, E116, E118, D120, D162, D170, D215, E216, E217, E218, E272, E274, and the C-terminus) and thus deploys a large negatively charged surface to attract its polycationic substrate (Fig.\\xa05c). A corridor that lies aside and beyond the acetyl group of the cofactor is approximately 7–8\\u2009Å deep and 8–9\\u2009Å wide with respect to the thioester carbonyl atom. Although we did not obtain crystals of a ternary PamZ-acetyl-CoA-paenilamicin complex, the position of acetyl-CoA, the well-defined shape of the neighboring pocket and our knowledge about the substrate’s N-terminal acetylation site allows us to predict that the Glm/Aga side chain of paenilamicin very likely penetrates into this pocket. Acidic residues D25 (loop between α1’ and α2’), E122 (β6’), and E208 (β4a) are well-positioned within the pocket to accommodate and stabilize the guanidine group of Aga, as well as to tolerate the Nζ amine of Glm. Other residues that shape the substrate pocket include T58/T59 (loop between β3’ and β4’), T98 (β5’) and Y124 (β6’) of the NTD as well as C200/Y201 (β3b) and S245/F247 (β5) of the CTD (Fig.\\xa06c). This shows that both domains most likely contribute to substrate recognition. Moreover, the structure of PamZ explains its regioselectivity: if PamZ was to modify e.g. the terminal amino group of spermidine in paenilamicin, the enzyme would not require such a deep substrate-binding pocket. The architecture of the central groove between the NTD and CTD has evolved to optimally accommodate the N-terminal Glm/Aga building block of paenilamicin, whilst terminal amines such as those of spermidine, ornithine and lysine side chains would not occupy this binding pocket, as they would experience significantly less binding stabilization. Such accommodation of Glm/Aga in the substrate pocket would position the N-terminal amino group of Aga-6 close to the thioester carbonyl of the cofactor. An active site aspartate or glutamate residue commonly acts as a general base to trigger the N-acetylation reaction by deprotonation of the amine followed by a nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl of the thioester35. In PamZ, the side chains of E122 (β6’) as well as E208 (β4a) exhibit an interatomic distance of ~7\\u2009Å to the carbonyl atom of acetyl-CoA and thus might be in close proximity to the N-terminal amino group of Aga-6 (Fig.\\xa06c). Residue S245 (β5) is sandwiched between E122 and E208, and may mediate deprotonation and/or proton shuttling. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the involvement of water molecules during proton transfer. An oxyanion hole as described for myristoyl-CoA transferase39 is not present in PamZ, but the amide proton of V211 (β4b) facilitates hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl oxygen of the thioester, which would increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon and stabilize the tetrahedral transition state after nucleophilic attack. Self-resistance mechanism of P. larvae The deactivation of paenilamicin through formation of N-acetylpaenilamicin by the action of PamZ (Supplementary Figs.\\xa03–7) implicates that the enzyme may confer self-resistance to the producer strain P. larvae. To test this hypothesis, we exposed the deletion mutant P. larvae ∆pamZ to a mixture of paenilamicin A1/B1 in an agar diffusion assay. The mixture, which was purified from P. larvae ERIC II, inhibited bacterial growth of the deletion mutant ∆pamZ, but not that of the WT strain (Fig.\\xa07a).Fig. 7Self-resistance of P. larvae against paenilamicin.a Deactivation of a paenilamicin mixture A1/B1 (left) was tested by an agar diffusion assay against P. larvae WT (top) and P. larvae ∆pamZ (bottom).

This result demonstrated that P. larvae requires the resistance gene, pamZ, to protect itself from the deleterious effects of its own antibacterial agent, paenilamicin. For further experimental support, we analyzed supernatants and cell pellets of P. larvae WT and ∆pamZ for paenilamicins and N-acetylpaenilamicins. In cell lysates of P. larvae WT, we exclusively found N-acetylpaenilamicin, whereas for the deletion mutant ∆pamZ only unmodified paenilamicin (Fig.\\xa07b) was detected. From paenilamicin isolates of the WT strain, primarily paenilamicin and only small amounts of N-acetylpaenilamicin were found in the supernatant by HPLC-ESI-MS (Supplementary Fig.\\xa02). These findings demonstrate that the self-resistance factor PamZ enables P. larvae WT to acetylate and thus inactivate intracellular paenilamicin. N-acetylation functions as an efficient self-protection mechanism by scavenging paenilamicin that reenters the cells of P. larvae. However, this mechanism may not apply to intracellular paenilamicin after its release from the NRPS-PKS assembly line. Instead, it seems very likely that an inactive precursor, i.e. a prodrug, of paenilamicin is produced to mask the strong antibacterial activity before cellular export. Along these lines, the biosynthetic gene cluster of paenilamicin23 harbors the pamJ gene, which shows significant sequence similarity to a cyclic-peptide export ABC transporter with d-asparagine-specific peptidase activity that has been reported to be involved in a prodrug resistance mechanism in nonribosomal peptide synthesis40–43. The peptidase recognizes and cleaves an N-acyl-d-asparagine unit of the prodrug. Accordingly, P. larvae must have developed a dual self-resistance mechanism against paenilamicin both potentially addressing the N-terminal Glm/Aga residue, specifically the N-terminal amino group at Aga-6 position, as modification site. Not only P. larvae, but also other bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes refer to a dual self-resistance mechanism associated with NRPS-PKS-derived compounds like amicoumacin42,44, zwittermicin31, and edeine45 (Supplementary Fig.\\xa029). In a very recent study, paenilamicin B2 showed an inhibitory effect (IC50 of ~0.3\\u2009µM) on the E. coli ribosome in vitro, whereas the non-native diastereomer PamB2_2 was approximately tenfold and the N-acetylpaenilamicin B2 approximately 100-fold less active29. The modifications of the N-terminal amino group at Aga-6 thus point to the importance of the N-terminal Glm/Aga residue as a major pharmacophore mediating recognition at the molecular target. The insights into the pharmacophore region of paenilamicins and the structure of PamZ including its substrate-binding pocket may lead to the development of inhibitors against the self-resistance factor to weaken the bee larvae pathogen. This study lays an appreciable foundation to understand the self-resistance mechanisms of P. larvae and to screen for potential small molecule inhibitors that target the active site of PamZ and compete with the naturally occurring paenilamicin. Consequently, the inhibitors would disable the self-resistance of P. larvae to paenilamicin resulting in the suicide of the bacterial pathogen for the benefit of the honey bee larvae. Such an anti-virulence strategy has the advantage that it circumvents the direct selection pressure on P. larvae to produce resistant strains because it only disarms the bacterium instead of interfering in essential bacterial functions. Therefore, it is not expected that inhibiting PamZ will readily lead to the development of resistant strains, as has already happened with the classical antibiotic treatment of AFB46. Assuming that the potential candidate has been confirmed in lab-scale applications, it could be applied in honey bee colonies by preventively impregnating the brood comb wax foundations with the substance so that it is dissolved in the brood food and then ingested by the larvae during early larval stages when P. larvae poses the most serious threat. Certainly, finding a small molecule inhibitor for PamZ and optimizing its application have to be further investigated in future studies. In summary, these results expand our knowledge of the molecular strategies exploited by P. larvae to survive in its ecological niche\\xa0—\\xa0knowledge that is needed to combat this pathogen and secure the health of bee colonies worldwide.']"
