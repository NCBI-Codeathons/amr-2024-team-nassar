-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 2:

text:
The rare actinomycete Actinoplanes friuliensis is the producer of the lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin, which is active against a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Enterococcus spec. and Staphylococcus aureus (MRE, MRSA) strains. Friulimicin consists of a decapeptide core and an acyl residue linked to an exocyclic amino acid. The complete biosynthetic gene cluster consisting of 24 open reading frames was characterized by sequence analysis and the transcription units were subsequently determined by RT-PCR experiments. In addition to several genes for biosynthesis, self-resistance and transport four different regulatory genes (regA, regB, regC and regD) were identified within the cluster. To analyse the role of the pathway-specific regulatory protein RegA in the friulimicin biosynthesis, the corresponding gene was inactivated resulting in friulimicin non-producing mutants. Furthermore, several protein-binding sites within the friulimicin gene cluster were identified by gel retardation assays. By real-time RT-PCR experiments, it was shown that the majority of the friulimicin biosynthetic genes is positively regulated by RegA

Example 3:

text:
 constitutive. Analysis of the UDP-linked peptidoglycan precursors revealed the presence of UDP-glycomuramyl pentadepsipeptide terminating in D-alanyl-D-lactate. No trace of precursors ending in d-alanyl-d-alanine was detected. Thus, the van gene complex was transcribed and expressed in the genetic background of A. teichomyceticus and conferred resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin through the modification of cell wall biosynthesis. During teicoplanin production (maximum productivity, 70 to 80 microg/ml), the MIC of teicoplanin remained in the range of 25 to 35 microg/ml. Teicoplanin-producing cells were found to be tolerant to high concentrations of exogenously added glycopeptides, which were not bactericidal even at 5,000 microg/ml.
